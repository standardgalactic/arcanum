and help of many people to whom I am very indebted. 
First and foremost, I would like to express my gratitude to Professor Iggy 
Roca. His guidance and discussion during the time I spent in preparing this 
work are immense. His valuable comments, criticism and comprehensive 
and profound knowledge in the field of phonology, and linguistics in 
general, have greatly contributed to the quality and style of this work.  
I also owe special thanks to the forty five subjects, who were native Arabic 
speakers, for their assistance and cooperation in the data gathering process 
for this research which took place in the United Kingdom.  
A debt of enormous gratitude is also owed to all the members of Khalifa 
Educational and Social Welfare Association, Nuneaton, UK, who helped 
me to fund this research. 
A huge thank you also goes to my family in Egypt: my father Fathy 
Khalifa and my mother Amina Ilshabrawy – for their financial and moral 
support and prayers. I am also grateful to my wife Dr Eman Abdelwahed 
and my children Yasmin, Khalid, Maryam, Ammar and Reem for being 
patient and tolerant during the time of writing this thesis. Whatever I say 
and whatever I do I cannot thank them enough. 
I am also very grateful to Dorothy Brailsford who helped me a lot 
regarding typing and proofreading the whole book. To the many others 
who contributed to this project in a variety of ways and capacities, my 
deepest gratitude. It goes without saying that any errors or infelicities that 
may have escaped scrutiny are of my sole making. 
Lastly but most importantly, I thank God for His blessings on this 
enterprise, especially for giving me the health and strength to perserve 
mentally and physically, during the entire period of this research.  

ABSTRACT 
 
 
 
This study is a contrastive analysis of Arabs’ errors in English pronunciation 
regarding segmentals-consonants, consonant clusters and vowels-and 
suprasegmentals-main word stress. It also explains the main interlingual 
reasons behind these errors and presents some teaching suggestions for 
surmounting them. This research has two hypotheses. First, the subjects 
substitute their own Arabic sounds (i.e. L1 negative transfer) for the 
unfamiliar English ones, producing incorrect English sounds. Second, the 
subjects apply Arabic main word stress rules (i.e. L1 negative transfer) 
instead of English ones, producing incorrect English stress patterns. These 
hypotheses were confirmed, albeit to different degrees due to sounds and 
stress patterns (word class), as shown in the results.  
Forty five Arab subjects, all of whom speak English as a foreign language, 
took part in this study: fifteen Saudi Arabians, fifteen Egyptians and 
fifteen Libyans. The educational setting for this research was the Saudi 
School in Sheffield, England where I worked as a teacher of English to 
Arab students. 
This research was based on analysing recorded data collected through 
elicitation: ‘reading aloud’ and ‘guided composition’. The subjects were 
asked to record their reading of lists of English words and description of a 
picture. All the recordings were transcribed and tables showing correct and 
incorrect pronunciation were drawn up. 
The subjects found difficulty in pronouncing some English consonants 
such as /p/, /v/, /ƾ/, dark /ڢ/, syllabic consonants and consonant doubling. 
They also had trouble with two-element clusters beginning with /p/, /s/, 
/g/, /݇/, consonant + /j/, /dw/ and all three-element clusters. In addition, 
they inserted a vowel between the elements of medial and final clusters. 
Regarding vowels, the subjects confused most of the English vowels and 
diphthongs with each other or substituted Arabic vowels for English ones. 
Finally, they stressed the last syllable of English words ending in V:, V:C 
and VCC and the first syllable of words having the syllabic pattern 
CVCVCV(C).

INTRODUCTION
 
 
 
 
1.1 Research Area and Definition of Terminology 
I take it you already know 
Of tough and bough and cough and dough? 
Others may stumble but not you 
On hiccough, thorough, lough and through. 
Well done! And now you wish, perhaps, 
To learn of less familiar traps? 
Beware of heard, a dreadful word, 
That looks like beard and sounds like bird. 
And dead: it’s said like bed, not bead – 
For goodness sake don’t call it ‘deed’ 
Watch out for meat and great and threat 
(They rhyme with suite and straight and debt) 
(T.S.W. 1970) 
 
Correct pronunciation is a means of achieving a confident grasp of the 
spoken language, as suggested by Jones (1967), O’Connor (1973), Roach 
(1983) and Kenworthy (1987). This study is an error analysis of English 
pronunciation errors among Arabs. It is an attempt to pinpoint the 
phonological problems that may be encountered by Arabs as non-native 
speakers of English regarding segmentals (consonants and vowels) and 
suprasegmentals (main word stress). It also studies the main reasons 
behind these errors and presents some teaching suggestions for 
surmounting them. This study does not deal with other suprasegmentals: 
secondary stress, sentence stress, intonation or rhythm. 
There are some phonetic problems standing in the way of Arabs as non-
native speakers of English (Heliel, 1972). First, English spelling is not 
phonetic due to the mismatch between orthography and pronunciation in 
many words. Second, many English sounds and stress rules do not occur 
in learner’s first language (Lado, 1957; Smith, 1987). The main difficulties 
in learning to speak a second or foreign language correctly are expressed 
by Jones (1967, 2), as follows:  

Chapter One

(1) 
Difficulty No. 1. He must learn to recognise readily and with 
certainty the various speech sounds occurring in the language, when he 
hears them pronounced; he must moreover learn to remember the acoustic 
qualities of those sounds. 
Difficulty No. 2. He must learn to make the foreign sounds with his own 
organs of speech. 
Difficulty No. 3. He must learn to use those sounds in their proper places 
in connected speech. 
Difficulty No. 4. He must learn the proper usage in the matter of the 
‘sound attributes’ or ‘prosodies’ as they are often called (especially length, 
stress and voice-pitch). 
Difficulty No. 5. He must learn to catenate sounds, i.e. to join each sound 
of a sequence on to the next, and to pronounce the complete sequence 
rapidly and without stumbling. 
The student, who wishes to become proficient in the written as well as the 
spoken language, has an additional difficulty, which we may call 
Difficulty No. 6. He has to learn the shapes of the conventional letters and 
the relations between the conventional orthography and the pronunciation. 
The present study tries to test the above six difficulties mentioned by 
Jones in general and nos. 2 and 4 in particular. Difficulty nos. 2, 4, 5 and 
6 are tested directly through asking the subjects to pronounce some lists of 
words and sentences. The aim is to check their production of English 
sounds, stress placement, pronunciation of consonant clusters and 
recognition of the relationship between orthography and pronunciation. In 
addition, difficulty nos. 1 and 3 are tested indirectly through reading lists 
of words and describing a picture. This is to check the Arab learners’ 
recognition of English sounds and their proper use of these sounds in 
connected speech. 
Word stress location differs greatly from one language to another (Hayes, 
1995). Some languages have ‘fixed’ stress, for example, in Finnish stress 
falls on the first syllable of the word, in Polish on the next to the last 
syllable and in French on the last (Ladefoged, 1993). Others, such as 
English, have ‘free’, or ‘movable’ stress, so that when a speaker of any of 
the aforementioned languages or Arabic learns English, mastering the 
position of stress in the word is a matter of some difficulty (Weinreich, 
1953; James, 1980; Smith, 1987).  
 

Introduction 
 
3 
When Arabs speak a foreign language in general and English in particular, 
they tend to pronounce the sounds and place the stress according to the 
rules of their own language, Arabic (Heliel, 1972; Broselow, 1983, 1984). 
Arabs learning English as a foreign language have not normally had early 
acquisition of the sounds and stress system of this language. The learning 
starts after the person has already developed a set of linguistic habits of his 
own native language. These linguistic habits may come into conflict with 
the habits of the new language. The Arab learners, therefore, have to 
acquire the new habits and at the same time try to avoid interference from 
the old habits. In particular, they need to learn how to stress the English 
words, since knowing the correct stress placement is part and parcel of 
what we mean when we say that a person has command of English 
(Kingdon, 1958).  
The stress rules of English are more complicated than those of many other 
languages (Halle and Vergnaud, 1987; Hayes, 1995; Kager, 1995 and 
many others). Indeed, the English and Arabic stress patterns are 
sufficiently different to create difficulty for Arab learners, due to the 
seemingly unpredictable nature of English in comparison with the 
relatively straightforward Arabic stress placement rules. The Arab 
learners, therefore, have to learn the stress pattern of each English word, in 
the face of a lot of Arabic interference. 
The purpose of this study is to analyse interlingual errors (due to L1 
interference) in English sounds and main word stress that may be 
encountered by Arabs as non-native speakers of English. Furthermore, it 
sheds light on the interlingual reasons behind these errors and suggests 
some remedial work in the form of teaching. This will hopefully help 
Arabs to overcome the errors which stand in the way to their linguistic 
proficiency. This study begins with a brief definition of terms, followed by 
aims and justification of the study, linguistic background, methodology, 
theories of second language (L2) acquisition and comparison of English 
and Arabic sounds and main word stress rules. The results are discussed, 
the interlingual reasons behind the errors are explained and finally some 
teaching suggestions are presented. 
1.1.1 Mistake and Error 
Corder (1967) makes a distinction between mistake and error. A mistake is 
a random performance slip caused by fatigue, excitement, etc., and 
therefore can be readily self-corrected. An error is a systematic deviation 
made by learners who have not yet mastered the rules of the second 

Chapter One

language (L2). Richards (1971) notices two types of error: interlingual and 
intralingual errors, as follows. 
• 
Interlingual errors are those which second language (L2) learners 
may commit due to first language interference. 
• 
Intralingual errors are those committed by L2 learners, regardless 
of their first language. 
1.1.2 Contrastive Analysis (CA) 
Crystal (1997, 90) defines contrastive analysis (CA), as follows. 
(2) The phrase contrastive analysis (CA) identifies a general approach to 
the investigation of language, particularly as carried out in certain areas 
of APPLIED LINGUISTICS, such as foreign-language teaching and 
translation. In a contrastive analysis of two languages, the points of 
STRUCTURAL difference are identified, and these are then studied as 
areas of potential difficulty (INTERFERENCE or ‘negative transfer’) 
in foreign-language learning. 
Here the following two points can be noticed: 
• 
The present contrastive analysis is between British English 
(Received Pronunciation, RP) and Modern Standard Arabic (MSA). 
RP is the accent chosen for contrast for its richness in teaching 
materials in the Arab countries.  
• 
Mother tongue interference is not the only cause of error. Faulty 
initial teaching, misconceptions, simplification, hypercorrection, 
false concepts and overgeneralisations also cause errors (James, 
1980).  
1.1.3 Error Analysis (EA) 
Crystal (1997, 139) defines error analysis (EA), as follows. 
(3) In language learning and teaching, error analysis is a technique for 
identifying, classifying and systematically interpreting the unacceptable 
forms produced by someone learning a foreign language, using any of 
the principles and procedures provided by linguistics. 
Following Crystal’s definition, the present study includes the three stages of 
EA identification, classification, and interpretation of the learners’ errors. It 
also provides some teaching suggestions for surmounting them. 

Introduction 
 
5 
Error analysis is a complex matter, and not all errors are internal to the 
language system (Broselow, 1984). They may be due to external factors 
such as inadequate teaching or poorly prepared materials (Selinker, 1972). 
Some errors may even be tolerated by teachers in pursuit of greater fluency 
on the part of learners.  
1.1.4 Interference and Interlanguage 
Interference, also called negative transfer, refers to the errors a speaker 
introduces into one language as a result of contact with another (Trask, 
1996). Most commonly these errors arise as a result of native tongue 
interference. Broselow (1984, 254) points out that ‘it is clear that 
interference is one factor in accounting for learners’ errors’. 
The language system that the learner constructs out of the linguistic input to 
which he has been exposed has been referred to as an ‘idiosyncratic dialect’ 
(Corder, 1971), ‘an approximative system’ (Nemser, 1971) and an 
‘interlanguage’ (Selinker, 1972). While these three terms differ somewhat 
in their emphases, it is actually ‘interlanguage’ that has entered common 
parlance. 
1.1.5 Stress 
Phonetic stress refers to the extra degree of force used in pronouncing a 
particular word or syllable (Crystal, 1997). Stressed syllables are more 
prominent than unstressed ones (Archibald, 1998, Hammond, 1999), e.g. 
the first syllable in ‘PHOtograph’, the second in ‘phoTOgrapher’ and the 
third in ‘photoGRAphic’ are more prominent than the others. This 
prominence is usually achieved by an increase in the LOUDNESS of the 
stressed syllable, but can also be due to an increase in LENGTH or PITCH 
or a combination of all the three (Trask, 1996, Archibald, 1998). 
O’Connor (1973, 194) defines stress, as follows. 
(4) Stress is the name given to the stronger muscular effort, both 
respiratory and articulatory, which we feel in connection with some 
syllables as opposed to others in English and other languages. For 
instance, August has more effort on the first than the second syllable, 
we hit it harder; but august has the greater effort on the second 
syllable. 
This research is an error analysis of Arabs’ interlingual errors in English 
main word stress and sounds and the reasons behind these errors. It also 

Chapter One  
 
6 
presents some teaching suggestions for overcoming them. In addition, it 
does not deal with English secondary word stress. 
1.2 Aims and Justification of the Study 
This section explains the main aim of this research. It also points out the 
importance of studying the errors made by Arabs in English sounds and 
main word stress and the reasons behind them.  
1.2.1 Aims of the Study 
Errors, like straws, upon the surface flow; 
He who would search for pearls must dive below. 
(John Dryden) 
The main aim of this study is to analyse the specific areas and types of 
errors in English pronunciation among Arabic speakers in the light of a 
short contrastive study of English and Arabic sound systems and stress 
placement rules. It also shedslight on the main reasons for these errors and 
suggests some teaching recommendations for overcoming them. It includes 
three groups of Arab subjects: Egyptians, Saudi Arabians and Libyans. 
Two groups of features of pronunciation are involved: segmentals and 
suprasegmentals. Segmentals refer to the basic inventory of distinctive 
sounds (consonants and vowels) and the way they combine to form a 
spoken language. Suprasegmentals are concerned with features above the 
level of the segment andinclude stress, rhythm and intonation. Only sounds 
and main word stress are analysed in this study. 
1.2.2 Justification of the Study 
The study of errors that L2 learners make can certainly provide vital clues 
as to their competence in the TL. (Harley, 1980, 4) 
The primary aim of this CA is to focus on analysing Arabs’ errors in 
English pronunciation. Learners’ errors are invaluable to the study of the 
language-learning process. Errors are studied to enable us to infer the 
nature of the learner’s knowledge at that point in his learning career and 
discover what he still has to learn. By describing and classifying his errors, 
we build up a picture of the features of the language which are causing 
him learning problems. Error analysis thus provides a check on the 
predictions of bilingual comparisons and the strategies employed by 

Introduction 
 
7 
students learning another language. Corder (1981, 13) mentions that by 
studying a learner’s errors: 
(5) We may be able to allow the learner’s innate strategies to dictate our 
practice and determineour syllabus; we may learn to adapt ourselves to 
his needs rather than impose upon him our preconceptions of how he 
ought to learn, what he ought to learn and when he ought to learn it. 
Contrastive studies of the native language and the target language have 
been widely accepted by linguists as a sound basis for teaching a foreign 
language. Fries and Lado are among the advocates of these studies. Fries 
(1945, 5) expresses the importance of basing teaching material on a 
contrastive basis: 
(6) …only with sound materials based upon an adequate descriptive 
analysis of both the language to be studied and the native language of 
the student (or with continued expert guidance of a trained linguist) can 
an adult make the maximum progress toward the satisfactory mastery 
of a foreign language. 
The significance of this contrastive study is assessed in pinpointing the 
different types of pronunciation errors encountered by Arabs as non-native 
speakers of English.

TEACHERS 
Errors provide feedback and tell the teacher something about the 
effectiveness of teaching materials and his teaching techniques and show 
him what parts of the syllabus have been inadequately learned or taught 
and need further attention. 
ARAB LEARNERS 
The findings of this research are clearly of interest to Arab learners 
because the making of errors can be regarded as a device used to learn. 
They can also reflect to them how far they have progressed and what 
remains to be learnt. Moreover, with careful preparation and avoidance of 
these errors, pronunciation can play an important role in supporting Arab 
learners’ overall communicative power.

Learners’ errors can be invaluable to both applied linguists and 
psycholinguists. For the applied linguist errors can shed light on how 
language is learnt or acquired, what strategies or procedures the learner is 
employing in his discovery of the language. The psycholinguist predicts 
that the nature of the mother tongue will facilitate or make difficult the 
learning of certain aspects of an L2.  
WRITERS AND PUBLISHERS 
Analysing errors can provide writers and publishers with the necessary 
information for designing a remedial syllabus or programme of re-teaching 
dealing with the specific problems of Arabs in English pronunciation. 
1.3 Background to the Study 
This section provides the linguistic and theoretical background for this 
study. The linguistic background covers some information about the 
Arabic language and Arabic speakers of L2 English. The theoretical 
background section sheds light on the three theories of L2 acquisition 
which are used to analyse Arabic speakers’ errors in English sounds and 
main word stress. These theories are: Contrastive Analysis (CA) (Fries, 
1945), Error Analysis (EA) (Corder, 1967) and Markedness Theory 
(Eckman, 1977).

1.3.1 Linguistic Background 
The linguistic background covers the Arabic Language and dialect of the 
Study. There is, then, a section about the Arab learners of English and 
TEFL in the Arab schools which shows the obstacles that have led to the 
low standard of Arabs’ spoken English. Finally, it has two sections on 
English pronunciation problems faced by Arab learners, English stress 
patterns and effective communication.  
1.3.1.1 The Arabic Language 
Arabic is one of the world’s major languages, spoken in a broad belt 
extending from the Arabian Peninsula across the Fertile Crescent and on to 
the Atlantic Ocean. It is the mother tongue of some 280 million people 
(Watson, 2002). In addition, many millions of Muslims in other countries 
have some knowledge of Arabic because of its position as the language of 
Islam and of the Holy Qur’an (Mitchell, 1962). Arabic is the chief member 
of the Semitic family of languages (Tritton, 1943; Watson, 2011), which 
also includes Hebrew and Amharic, the main language of Ethiopia. In 1974, 
Arabic was made the sixth official language of the United Nations. The 
largest numbers of Arabic speakers are found in Egypt, Iraq, Morocco, 
Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Syria, Tunisia, Yemen and Algeria. 
Great languages spring from great Empires, and Arabic is no exception. 
Until the seventh century AD, its use was confined to the Arabian 
Peninsula. But the language was carried far beyond its original borders 
through the spectacular Islamic conquests, and almost supplanted all the 
previous languages of Iraq, Syria, Egypt and North Africa. Further 
conquests in succeeding centuries temporarily spread the presence of 
Arabic as far as Afghanistan in the east and Spain in the west. Like the 
other Semitic languages, Arabic is written from right to left and its alphabet 
consists of twenty eight consonant letters, with vowel signs being optionally 
indicated by marks above or below the letters (Tritton, 1943; Mitchell, 
1962). The Arabic alphabet is second only to the Roman alphabet in its use 
world-wide. Socio-linguistically, Arabic is noted for its diglossic situation 
(Mitchell, 1962), and phonetically for the use of sounds which involve the 
pharynx (notably the pharyngeal consonants). According to Watson (2002), 
apart from its great intrinsic interest, the importance of the Arabic language 
for phonological and morphological theory lies in its rich root-and-pattern 
morphology and its large set of guttural consonants. 
 

Chapter One  
 
10 
There are three main types of Arabic – Classical Arabic (ClA), Modern 
Standard Arabic (MSA) and local dialects (Mitchell, 1962). Classical 
Arabic was originally the dialect of Mecca, in what is now Saudi Arabia. 
MSA is an adapted form of ClA and is taught in schools throughout the 
Arab countries. It is the language of contemporary literature, journalism, 
broadcasting, public address (Mitchell, 1962), and in conversation between 
educated Arabs from different countries – it is the language of government 
and formal affairs. It differs very little from ClA in phonology, morphology 
or syntax. The main difference lies in the realm of lexicon. Spoken Arabic 
naturally varies from one country to another (Mitchell, 1962), but Classical 
Arabic has hardly changed since the seventh century. ClA has played a 
prominent role as a great unifying force in the development and 
standardisation of the language. Local dialects vary, and a Moroccan may 
have difficulty understanding an Iraqi, although they speak the same 
language.  
1.3.1.2 Dialect of the Study 
The dialect of this study is Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) which is the 
standardised and literary variety of Arabic across the Middle East, North 
Africa and Horn of Africa. It is used in writing and in most formal speech 
throughout the Arab world to facilitate communication. Most Arabic 
speakers consider the two varieties to be two registers of one language, 
although the two registers can be referred to in Arabic. MSA is chosen to 
be the dialect of this study, since it is a standardized language and its 
spoken form is used as a lingua franca across the Arab world. British 
English (Received Pronunciation, RP) is the accent chosen for contrast for 
its richness in teaching materials in the Arab countries.  
1.3.1.3 The Arab Learner of English 
English is the lingua franca in many countries and it plays a prominent 
role in developing the world’s education and business. This global 
significance makes English receive special attention in the Arab countries. 
Teaching English as a foreign language (TEFL) in many Arab countries is 
gaining increased importance due to the importance of English for 
business, transport, science and technology. Over the last few decades, the 
Arab learners have shown a keen interest in recognising the English 
language as a language of common usage in business and education. The 
preparation of the Arab learner varies from one Arab country to another. 
However, the learner spends six to eight years learning English. This 
should enable him to communicate fluently and efficiently. But, this is not 

Introduction 
 
11 
the case. Guided by my experience in teaching English to Arab students 
for twenty years, I noticed that there are many errors in their English 
pronunciation. This is due to many reasons such as: 
(a) Most Arab countries consider English as a ‘school subject’ rather 
than a means of communication. In addition, English is taught 
through Arabic. 
(b) Pronunciation is completely neglected as most teachers are neither 
phonetically trained nor in possession of the skill to teach spoken 
English. Thus, learners are eye-minded rather than ear-minded. 
(c) Examinations test the student’s knowledge of facts about the 
language and his ability to memorise but not his ability to use and 
understand English. 
(d) The lack of discussing pronunciation errors related to interference 
between Arabic and English. 
(e) Arabic and English have different sound and orthography systems, 
syllable structures, stress patterns and different cultural background. 
 
The obstacles depicted above, have led to a deterioration of the standard of 
Arabs’ spoken English. All Arab learners, therefore, should receive 
enough oral practice, as it is the key feature of mastering pronunciation.  
1.3.1.4 TEFL in the Arab Schools 
English is used as a foreign language in the Arab countries and is not 
spoken as a second language. Therefore, teaching English to Arab EFL 
learners has always been an exacting task. In early English teaching in the 
Arab schools, teachers used various classroom techniques: grammar-
translation, reading methods and direct methods. Then most countries 
adopted the lingual approach, which proved to be desirable. Later on, the 
communicative approach was partially adopted by some Arab countries. 
However, many Arab EFL learners’ proficiency in English remains 
inadequate and below expectation. This is due to inadequate preparation of 
teachers, lack of motivation on the part of the learners, teacher centred 
methods and inadequate assessment techniques.  
Some of the problems the EFL Arab teachers face are absence of listening 
and speaking tests, teaching method not being communicative, students’ 
attitude towards speaking and lack of necessary facilities. Arab EFL 
students also face main problems such as lack of linguistic knowledge, 
lack of motivation and confidence and accessive use of Arabic language.

1.3.1.5 English Pronunciation Problems and Arab Learners 
A basic knowledge of phonetics is essential for any person who works with 
language. Language teachers, particularly, require both theoretical and 
practical phonetic knowledge to analyse their students’ pronunciation errors 
and to prepare suitable remedial measures. Similarly, language students 
need the same knowledge to monitor their own pronunciation. The 
following quotation throws more light on the importance of phonetics in the 
teaching of foreign languages. Malmberg (1963, 109) states that ‘the 
teaching of foreign languages is also a field in which phonetics has a very 
great practical importance. Anyone wishing to learn to pronounce a foreign 
language properly will first have to acquire the mastery of a large number 
of new articulatory habits. He must accustom himself to articulate the 
foreign sounds exactly as native speakers do in the language in question, 
and not to continue using habits particular to his native tongue’.  
In his influential book ‘An Outline of English Phonetics’, Jones (1967) 
mentions that a person learning a foreign language does not normally have 
the opportunity of the early acquisition of the segmental and suprasegmental 
features of that language. As a result, an Arab person learning English will 
encounter some vowels and consonants which are unknown to him such as 
[p], >ƾ@ and >ۑ@ and some word stress rules which are different from Arabic 
ones. Parker and Graham (1994, 6) confirm this view by stating that 
‘however, learners do not, of course, acquire the whole phonology of a 
foreign language evenly or, indeed, identically. Particular learners will 
demonstrate particular difficulties with particular sounds or features of 
pronunciation’.  
Although there are not many teaching materials designed specifically for 
Arab learners, some researchers have carried out contrastive studies of 
English and Arabic. The weakness of these studies lies in the importance 
they give to the segmentals and the little attention given to the 
suprasegmentals. These analyses reinforce the tendency of both teacher and 
student to neglect the other equally important suprasegmental features. As a 
result, the students fail to understand and be understood by English people 
in spite of making English sounds quite well. 
Two of these studies are related to this book:  
(1) Raja Nasr’s ‘The Teaching of English to Arab Students’ (1963), is a 
contrastive study of Classical Arabic and English. Classical Arabic is not 
in everyday use and so this study is less useful than one based on 
Colloquial or Modern Standard Arabic. 

Introduction 
 
13 
(2) W.F. Stirling’s ‘An Introduction to English Phonetics for Arabic-
speaking Students’ (1960) is a good guide for Arab learners to the 
pronunciation of English consonants and vowels. But stress is only 
mentioned briefly and consonant clusters and English rhythm are 
not mentioned at all. 
  
To my mind, however useful the phoneme-oriented studies are, we must 
not think that teaching all the segmental sounds is equal to teaching the 
pronunciation of a language. The ability to use these sounds in connected 
speech is as important as the ability to make them in isolation.  
Regarding Arabs’ pronunciation errors, three books are also related to this 
book:  
(1) Kharma and Hajjaj (1997) ‘Errors in English among Arabic 
Speakers: Analysis and Remedy’ 
This book identifies specific difficulties experienced by Arab students and 
explains them in sound linguistic terms. Based on actual students’ work, it 
explores and explains problems with pronunciation and sentence structure. 
In addition, it includes some practical teaching suggestions and examples 
which can help Arab learners to surmount these difficulties. 
This book explains Arabs’ errors in English pronunciation in Part Two: 
The Sound System. It classifies these errors into two types: (a) sounds in 
isolation and (b) sounds in connected speech. Although the authors discuss 
the above errors and their causes, they do not explain clearly the effect of 
L1 interference. 
(2) Swan and Smith (1987) ‘Learner English: a teacher’s guide to 
interference and other problems’ 
In this book, the authors discuss briefly Arabs’ problems in English 
pronunciation regarding vowels, consonants, consonant clusters, rhythm, 
stress and intonation. In addition, they study some grammatical errors that 
Arabic speakers may make in English. 
Regarding English vowels, I do not agree with Smith (1987, 143) that 
‘…virtually all vowels may cause problems’. But I agree with him that: 
(7)…the following are the most common confusions: 
1. ܼ and /e/ are often confused: bit for bet. 
2. /ܥ and /୆ are often confused: cot for caught. 

Chapter One  
 
14 
Similarly, regarding English consonants, I agree with Smith that most of 
them can be articulated by Arabs without great difficulty and the main 
problems are related to the following phonemes: /p/, /v/, ƾ ݤ and /r/. 
But I do not agree with him that some Arabs tend to pronounce English /ð/ 
as /d/. From my teaching experience, I noticed that they replace English 
/ð/ with /z/. For example, ‘zat’ for ‘that’. In addition, I agree with him that 
‘the range of consonant clusters occurring in English is much wider than 
in Arabic’. As a result, Arabic speakers of L2 English tend to insert short 
vowels to assist pronunciation as in ‘௧ispring’ or ‘sipring’ for ‘spring’ and 
‘monthiz’ for ‘months’.  
Concerning stress, I agree with Smith (1987, 145) that ‘Arabic word stress 
in particular is predictable and regular. Arabic speakers, therefore, have 
problems grasping the unpredictable nature of English word stress’. 
(3) Baker (1982) ‘Introducing English Pronunciation: a teacher’s 
guide to Tree or Three?’ 
In this book, Baker mentions some of the Arabs’ errors in English 
pronunciation. Regarding consonants, I agree with most of the errors in 
her list such as: 
(8) p sounds close to b 
r strongly trilled 
pronounced where normally silent 
(Baker, 1982, 138) 
 
But I do not agree with her that Arabs pronounce /v/ as /f/ or /b/ and /w/ as 
/v/. First, Arabs sometimes replace /v/ by /f/ but not by /b/: their 
pronunciation of the words ‘van’ and ‘fan’ will be the same, /fæn/. 
Second, Arabic speakers have no problems with /w/ as it is common in 
many Arabic words such as ‘wahid’ (one) and ‘walad’ (boy). 
Although the three books mentioned above discuss briefly the specific 
English pronunciation errors made by Arabs, they work as a catalyst for 
this book. But this book differs in the following points: 
 (1) It studies, in more detail, only errors in English consonants, vowels 
and word stress 
(2) It explains more fully the interlingual reasons for these errors. 

Introduction 
 
15 
1.3.1.6 English Stress and Effective Communication 
In cross-language comparison, stress location in words differs greatly from 
one language to another. Some languages have a ‘fixed’ stress, for 
example, in Finnish stress falls on the first syllable of the word, in Polish 
on the next to the last syllable, in French on the last. Others, such as 
English, have a ‘free’, or ‘movable’ stress, so that when a speaker of any 
of the aforementioned languages or Arabic learns English, mastering the 
position of stress in the word is a matter of some difficulty. 
In his book ‘The Groundwork of English Stress’, Kingdon (1958, xi) 
explains the importance of correct stressing in English as follows: 
(9) In a strongly stressed language like English, where vowel quality is 
so frequently influenced by the presence or absence of stress, 
wrong stressing disguises words far more effectively than does 
wrong intonation. 
In the treatment of English stress, there are two extremes: those which 
consist of long lists of words with their stress patterns and those which 
concentrate on the theoretical aspects. Both are not very helpful to the 
foreign learner who wants to learn the basics of English stress to be able to 
predict the stress patterns of new words. A good treatment should bring 
together the practical and the theoretical, the lists and the principles. 
First of all, Kingdon’s ‘Groundwork of English Stress’ (1958) is 
considered as one of the main approaches to the question of English stress. 
His investigations showed that the main problems arose from ‘compounds’ 
which he classified into three types: 
(1) Romanic:root plus affixes, where the root may or may not be an 
independent word. 
(2) Greek:two or more roots that do not as a rule stand alone as 
complete words. 
(3) English: two or more roots that are independent words. 
Kingdon’s great contribution is the explanation of the effect of suffixes on 
stress placement in Romanic compounds and the main influence of the 
final root in Greek compounds.  
Kingdon’s conclusions may be refined and strengthened in several ways: 

Chapter One  
 
16 
(1) He does not differentiate between strong and weak syllables. 
(2) He does not recognise that a suffix which throws stress two 
syllables back will throw it one syllable only if there are not two 
syllables. For example, 'preferable, 'lovable.  
 
Until fairly recently, each English word was thought to have its own 
idiosyncratic stress. Jones (1967, 248) states: 
(10) Generally speaking there are no rules determining which syllable or 
syllables of polysyllabic English words bear the main stress. The 
foreign student is obliged to learn the stress of each word individually. 
 
 But Chomsky and Halle in their ‘The Sound Pattern of English’ (1968, 
59) argue that: 
(11)…both the placement of main stress and the stress contours within the 
word and the phrase are largely predictable from the syntactic and the 
non-prosodic phonological structure of an utterance by means of a 
transformational cycle. 
In fact, my own research does not follow Chomsky and Halle’s use of the 
cyclic principle. But it makes use of Kingdon’s book to prepare word lists 
to record and analyse Arabs’ errors in English main word stress. 
Moreover, this research studies not only Arabs’ problems in English word 
stress but in consonants and vowels as well.  
Finally, it is hoped that the findings of this study will help Arab learners of 
English to eliminate many of their faulty stressing and segmental 
pronunciation errors.  
1.3.2 Theoretical Background 
This research is an analysis of the interphonology (sound and main word 
stress errors) of the Arabic speakers of L2 English within the framework 
of three theories of second language acquisition: Contrastive Analysis 
(CA) (Fries, 1945), Error Analysis (EA) (Corder, 1967) and Markedness 
Theory (Eckman, 1977). CA explains L2 learners’ acquisitional 
difficulties on the basis of the differences and similarities between L1 and 
L2. Different L1 and L2 features are difficult to acquire, whereas similar 
features are easy to acquire. L2 learners’ errors are due to L1 negative 
transfer. EA explains L2 learners’ errors by comparing the learner’s 
interlanguage with the L2 norm. It explains both interlingual (L1 negative 

Introduction 
 
17 
transfer) and intralingual errors. Intralingual errors are not related to L1 
negative transfer and are due to other factors, such as faulty teaching 
techniques or materials, overgeneralization of L2 rules and age of L2 
acquisition. Markedness Theory is the CA plus typological markedness. It 
explains both the L2 learners’ difficulties (CA) and the degree (levels) of 
these difficulties (markedness). Markedness Differential Hypothesis 
(MDH) states that L2 structures that are both different and more marked 
than corresponding L1 structures will cause learning difficulty. Unmarked 
structures are acquired before and easier to acquire than marked structures. 
These theories are discussed in detail in Chapter 2: Theories of Second 
Language Acquisition.  
1.4 Methodology 
This section explains how this research was conducted and the used 
method of data collection. The data collection involved materials (a 
production test and description of a picture), sample and tape recording. 
The data analysis consisted of error analysis and statistical analysis. 
Linguistic analysis explains the reasons for the Arabic speakers’ errors in 
English pronunciation and main word stress. The statistical analysis 
explains the percentage of these errors.  
1.4.1 Choice of Method 
This research is an analysis of errors in English pronunciation that may be 
encountered by Arabs regarding English consonants, vowels and main 
word stress. This analysis was based on data collected through ‘elicitation’ 
from three different groups of Arab subjects. 
Studying subjects’ spontaneous production may be desirable but the 
presence of an observer can result in unspontaneous performance as the 
subjects may take more care over their speech. Even with completely 
spontaneous production data, we cannot rely solely on them in studying 
the SLA process due to the following drawbacks: 
(1) Unless some constraints are placed on the range of a subject’s 
possible responses, it is impossible to study all aspects of his 
developing performance. In normal conversation, certain language 
features cannot be studied because of their infrequent occurrence. 
(2) Learners will place their own limitations on the data (Corder, 
1981). In other words, they tend to use only those aspects in which 
they feel more confident and avoid the troublesome aspects in 

Chapter One  
 
18 
which the researcher may be most interested. 
(3) Comparing one study with another would be difficult if only 
spontaneous data were used, and also collecting enough data to 
make generalisations about L2 learners would take a long time. 
1.4.2 Elicitation 
The method used for this study was elicitation. An elicitation procedure is 
any method which provokes a learner to generate reliable linguistic data 
either in the form of factual utterances or judgements about utterances. 
The idea of eliciting data from subjects has always formed part of the 
methodology of descriptive linguistic research. Nunan (1992, 136) says: 
(12) Elicitation techniques have been a feature of second language 
acquisition research since the original morpheme order studies of the 
1970s. 
Having adopted the elicitation technique, it enabled me to: 
•  oblige the Arab subjects to produce the items I wanted to study; 
• 
obtain as natural a performance as possible while the subjects 
remained unaware of the investigated items. 
 
Corder (1981, 61) explains the importance of elicitation procedures as 
follows: 
(13) Elicitation procedures are used to find out something specific about 
the learner’s language, not just to get him to talk freely. To do this, 
constraints must be placed on the learner so that he is forced to make 
choices within a severely restricted area of his phonological, lexical, or 
syntactic competence. 
1.4.2.1 Elicitation Techniques 
There are many elicitation procedures employed in SLA research. Nunan 
(1992, 136) states: 
(14) Elicitation techniques vary enormously in scope, aim, and purpose. 
They include studies which obtain their data by means of a stimulus, 
such as a picture, diagram or standardised test, as well as those based 
on questionnaire, survey, and interview data. 
Larsen-Freeman and Long (1991) mention some of these procedures 
roughly in order of the degree of control over the learners’ performance. In

addition, they cite some representative studies in which the elicitation 
procedure has been used. I have shown some of these procedures in the

1.4.2.2 Study Elicitation Techniques 
In this research, I used two of the above elicitation procedures: 
(a) Reading aloud: Three groups of Arab subjects were asked to read 
aloud and record lists of English words to test particular 
consonants, vowels and word stress placement. 
(b) Guided composition: The same subjects were given a picture and 
asked to describe and record the scene in their own words. 
 
The above two elicitation procedures were chosen for my study for the 
following reasons: 
• 
Reading aloud enabled me to record the actual language 
pronounced by the Arab subjects. 
• 
This objective record was later analysed to pinpoint their errors in 
English pronunciation.  
• 
Guided composition also enabled me to record and analyse samples 
of the Arab subjects’ naturally occurring English language which 
were different from the constraints of the lists of words.

1.4.3 Data Collection 
1.4.3.1 Materials 
The main study consisted of two parts as now shown and in Appendix (A). 
The first part was made up of sets of words and sentences testing English 
sound and main word stress, as follows. 
1.4.3.1.1 Production Test 
The production test items were divided into three word groups (511 words 
total), which were chosen on the basis of Arabic and English sounds and 
stress placement rules and the expected areas of L1 transfer. These word 
groups had twenty five word classes, each testing a different aspect of 
English consonants, vowels and main word stress rules.  
Word group I (319 words, 10 classes) tested errors in English consonants, 
word group II (102 words, 7 classes) tested errors in English vowels and 
word group III (90 words, 8 classes) tested errors in main word stress. The 
experimental items of the production test are now presented, followed by 
predictions of how these words will be pronounced and stressed by the 
subjects.  
(A) Segmental Errors:  
Word Group I: Consonants (319 words)  
Prediction: Arabic speakers will have difficulty with some English 
consonants and will substitute their own Arabic consonant sounds for the 
unfamiliar English ones (i.e. L1 negative transfer), producing incorrect 
English consonants.

Prediction: These English words will be difficult for Arabic speakers, 
since there is a mismatch between English orthography and pronunciation, 
whereas Arabic spelling is simple and virtually phonetic.  
 - (7 b) (Silent Letters) (24 words) 
psalm, corps, subtle, plumb, nestle, fasten, handkerchief, handsome, 
knight, knave, feign, gnarled, alms, salmon, colonel, folklore, heir, 
annihilate, wrath, sword, plough, borough, solemn, damn 
Prediction: These English words will be difficult for Arabic speakers, 
since there is a match between Arabic orthography and pronunciation, and 
a single letter represents a single sound. 
- (7 c) (Consonant Doubling) (22 words) 
stubborn, account, address, odd, affair, suggest, allow, collect, 
accommodation, announcer, inn, support, correct, discuss, attack, attempt,

lewd, huge, few. twin, dwarf, queen, thwack, swing, spare, stay, scare, 
smile, snake, sphere, spleen, spring, string, scream, stew, square 
Prediction: These English initial consonant clusters will be difficult for 
Arabic speakers, since English permits much longer initial consonant 
clusters than Arabic and initial three-element clusters do not occur in 
Arabic.  

Introduction

- Class 9: (Medial Consonant Clusters) (11 words)   
 transport, transplant, landscape, handmark, grandmother, grandson.  
 long skirt, strange dream, bent screw, next, spring, She tempts strangers.  
Prediction: These English medial consonant clusters will be difficult for 
Arabic speakers, since Arabic does not permit more than two consonants 
word-medially. 
- Class 10: (Final Consonant Clusters) (91 words)  
- (10 a) (Clusters of two consonants) (52 words): 
grabbed, begged, seemed, cleaned, filled, wronged, proved, bathed, raised,

lamp, triumph, faint, dance, rank, bulb, silk, help, belt, film, shelf, else, 
valve 
Prediction: Arabic speakers will find varying degrees of difficulty with 
final two consonant clusters, since Arabic permits some two consonant 
clusters word-finally. 
 - (10 b) (Clusters of three consonants) (34 words)  
bronzed, filmed, delved, judged, changed, lapsed, taxed, midst, jumped, 
triumphed, touched, sensed, linked, amongst, helped, milked, pulsed, 
grasped, hands, builds, elms, shelves, scripts, facts, camps, nymphs, 
thanks, lifts, lisps, lists, tasks, helps, halts, milks 
Prediction: These English final three consonant clusters will be difficult 
for Arabic speakers, since Arabic does not permit three-element consonant 
clusters word finally.  
- (10 c) (Clusters of four consonants) (5 words)  
contexts, tempts, glimpsed, drenched, changed  
Prediction: These English final four consonant clusters will be difficult 
for Arabic speakers, since Arabic does not permit four-element consonant 
clusters word finally. 

Chapter One  
 
26 
Word Group II: (Vowels) (102 words):  
Prediction: Arabic speakers will have difficulty with some English 
vowels and will substitute their own Arabic vowel sounds for the 
unfamiliar English ones (i.e. L1 negative transfer), producing incorrect 
English vowels.  
- Class 11: (Short Vowels) (18 words) 
heavy, sit, deaf, set, pad, rash, gone, wash, wood, look, rub, hut, attempt, 
about, polite, postman, breakfast, sailor 
Prediction: Some of the English short vowels will be difficult for Arabic 
speakers, since English has a greater number of vowels than Arabic.  
- Class 12: (Long Vowels) (12 words)  
field, leaf, through, food, boot, cigar, heart, board, cork, fur, word, work  
Prediction: Some of the English long vowels will be difficult for Arabic 
speakers, since English and Arabic have two different vowel structures or 
patterns.  
- Class 13: (Diphthongs) (16 words)  
 
raid, fate, bite, ripe, boil, point, grow, stove, crown, mouth, beer, beard, 
bear, stare, tour, moor  
Prediction: Some of the English diphthongs will be difficult for Arabic 
speakers, since Arabic has no diphthongs.  
- Class 14: (Easily Confused Vowels) (56 words)   
The poor mastery of English vowels is the most noticeable feature in the 
English speech of Arabic speakers. Therefore, English vowels were tested 
twice using different lists of words. 
- (14 a): (Short Vowels) (14 words) 
miss, mess, bitter, better, luck, lock, cot, caught, gone, gun, put, pot, look, 
lock 
Prediction: Some of the English short vowels will be difficult for Arabic 
Speakers.

- (14 b): (Long Vowels) (20 words)  
sheep, ship, hurt, heart, dirt, dart, worm, warm, word, ward, staff, stuff, 
task, tusk, ball, phone, food, good, fool, stood 
Prediction: Some of the English long vowels will be difficult for Arabic 
Speakers. 
- (14 c): (Diphthongs) (22 words)  
sail, sell, vain, vine, pain, pine, hate, hat, fain, fan, fine, fin, bite, bit, bear, 
beer, chair, sheep, beard, bird, boat, bought  
Prediction: Some of the English diphthongs will be difficult for Arabic 
Speakers. 
- Class 15: (Intrusive Vowels) (5 words)  
spring, swing, worked, changed, grandfather  
Prediction: Some of these consonant clusters will be difficult for Arabic 
speakers and they will use an intrusive vowel as a cluster breaker.  
Class 16: (Vowel Reduction to Schwa) (10 words)   
Here they are, They are coming, Shoot at him, Stop at the next house, 
There is nothing to do, What do you see?, What is he waiting for?, He is 
waiting for pay. Read as much as you should., How should I know?.  
Prediction: Reducing the vowels of English function words to schwa ۑ 
will be difficult for Arabic speakers, since function words in Arabic do not 
have two forms and unstressed vowels keep their full value. 
- Class 17: (Vowel Length) (22 words)  
cap, cab, seat, seed, dock, dog, leaf, leave, belief, believe, vacation, 
occasion, faith, bathe, tooth, smooth, loose, lose, cease, seize, catch, cadge 
Prediction: Vowel length would be difficult for Arabic speakers, since 
Arabic vowels vary in length regardless of the following consonant.

(B) Suprasegmental Errors:  
Word Group III: (Errors in Word Stress) (90 words)  
 
Prediction: Arabic speakers will have difficulty with English main word 
stress and will apply Arabic stress rules (L1 negative transfer), producing 
incorrect English stress patterns.  
- Simple Word Stress (78 words)   
- Class 18: (unstressed final V: or VV) (10 words)  
'multiply, 'holiday, 'igloo, 'beautify, i'dentify, 'castaway, 'carboy, 'cargo,

Prediction: The final –CVVC will be stressed, as in Arabic. 
- Class 20: (unstressed final –CVCC) (16 words) 
 
 'manifest, 'scientist, 'punishment, 'applicant, 'product, 'difficult, 'concept, 
'impact, 'evident, 'impotent, 'management, ad'vertisement, con'versant, 
a'ppellant, 'occupant, 'specialist  
Prediction: The final –CVCC will be stressed, as in Arabic.  
- Class 21: (the CV'CVCV(C) syllabic pattern) (4 words)  
pa'cific, te'rrific, de'posit, so'licit 
Prediction: The initial CV will be stressed, as in Arabic. 
- Class 22: (stressed antepenult) (12 words)  
'silently, 'messenger, 'orchestra, 'barrister, 'cucumber, 'calender, 'currency, 
'helicopter, 'protestant, 'passenger, 'currency, 'thermostat  
Prediction: The English unstressed heavy penult will be stressed, since it 
is common in Arabic for a heavy penult to be stressed. 

Introduction 
 
29 
- Class 23: (stress preantepenult) (12 words)  
'necessary, 'mercenary, 'category, 'demonstrator, la'boratory, 'speculator, 
'characterise, 'matrimony, 'legislative, 'imaginary, 'accuracy, a'dequacy 
Prediction: The antepenultimate syllable will be stressed, as in Arabic, 
since stress in Arabic never precedes the three-syllable window. 
- Class 24: (stress contrasts) (12 words)  
 
we pro'test, our 'protest, we ob'ject, our 'object, we pre'sent, our 'present, to 
ex'port, our 'export, to pe'rmit, a 'permit, to pro'gress, our 'progress  
Prediction: Arabic speakers will find difficulty in English contrastive 
stress, since it is not common in Arabic which uses word order to show 
contrast.  
- Class 25: (compound stress) (12 words)   
'apple tree, 'flowerpot, 'blacksmith, 'greengrocer, 'birthday, 'sheepdog, 
'workshop, 'midnight, 'make-up, 'setback, 'greenhouse, 'classroom 
Prediction: Arabic speakers will find difficulty in these compound nouns 
and will apply Arabic compound stress rules. They will either place two 
main stresses on both elements of the compound or one main stress on the 
second element.  
The words in each word group were randomised in order not to make it 
easy for the subjects to deduce the tested rules or word stress patterns. 
While analysing stress errors, the tested words were re-categorised into 
their original groups. 
1.4.3.1.2 Description of a Picture 
The second part of the test consisted of one page of a stimulus large picture 
to be described by all the subjects. This enabled me to record and analyse 
samples of the subjects’ naturally occurring English language.  
1.4 3.2 Sample 
Sample Size 
At the outset, it was decided that ten subjects from each of six Arab groups 
(Egyptians, Saudi Arabians, Libyans, Yemenis, Algerians and Omanis) 
would be used in this study. However, due to the lack of willing subjects 

Chapter One  
 
30 
from the last three groups and the time limit of the research, the study was 
carried out with forty five subjects: fifteen subjects from each of the first 
three groups (Egyptians: 11 male, 4 female), (Saudi Arabians: 15 male) and 
(Libyans: 14 male, 1 female). The sample size was large and reliable 
enough for phonetic analysis, simple statistical analysis and generalisations 
of the findings within the three selected nationalities. 
The educational setting for this project is the Saudi School in Sheffield, 
England where I work as a teacher of English to Arab students. This school 
includes mixed Arab nationalities. The students themselves were too few to 
constitute reliable samples. As a result, their parents, brothers and some 
postgraduate students in Sheffield were chosen. The profile of the Arab 
subjects who took part in this study can be represented as follows.

Sampling Method 
Nunan (1992) mentions six strategies for sampling, which he adapted from 
Cohen and Manion (1985) as follows: simple random, systematic, stratified, 
cluster, convenience and purposive. In this research, the first method was 
used – simple random sampling. It involved selecting the required number 
of subjects at random from a list of the population. Thirty Arab subjects 
were postgraduate students living in Sheffield, England, while the 
remaining fifteen were parents and brothers of my students in the Saudi 
School in Sheffield. 
1.4.3.3 Tape Recording 
The data required for this study were collected by tape recording. Each 
recording session began with a few minutes of social questions: How are 
you today? Such questioning helped to put the subjects at ease before 

Introduction 
 
31 
starting the recording of the materials. The recording lasted for 
approximately twenty minutes. Twenty minutes was thought to be the 
maximum period for each session before fatigue and performance drops. 
The setting was kept as informal as possible, usually in a quiet location. 
There were some oral instructions for each subject at the beginning of each 
recording session with lists of words with varying degrees of difficulty and 
a picture to be described (see Appendix A). 
Each recording was made with a clip-on microphone and a small tape 
recorder placed in front of each subject. Nine tapes were recorded, three 
tapes for each subject sample. The quality of the recordings was satisfactory 
for phonetic analysis and of excellent fidelity. Two persons were present in 
each recording session: the participant and the researcher. The function of 
the researcher was to note phonetic errors and other factors which could be 
significant in the interpretation of the subject’s phonetic competence. There 
are numerous advantages of recording: 
• 
It enables the researcher to study the recorded material in an 
unhurried way without irritating the subject. 
• 
It allows the researcher to listen many times to a given utterance 
until being satisfied of detecting all the various sound and word 
stress errors. 
• 
This recording may be kept for future reference in studies analysing 
some other linguistic points in the subjects’ speech. 
 
At the end of the recording, I thanked the subjects for their co-operation and 
willingness to take part in this study. In addition, I promised to give a 
summary of the findings of the study to those subjects who were interested. 
This helped to give the subjects the feeling that the recording was a pleasant 
experience. 
1.4.4 Data Analysis 
1.4.4.1 Linguistic Analysis 
This research data are analysed in the light of the following three theories of 
second language acquisition: Contrastive Analysis (CA) (Fries, 1945), Error 
Analysis (EA) (Corder, 1967) and Markedness Theory (Eckman, 1977). 
These theories are explained in detail in Chapter 2: Theories of Second 
Language Acquisition.Moreover, a CA of English and Arabic sound 
systems and word stress rules was used to analyse the question of L1 Arabic 
interference (negative transfer) in the acquisition of L2 English. Lado 

Chapter One  
 
32 
(1957, 72) states that ‘the list of problems resulting from the comparison of 
the foreign language with the native language…must be considered a list of 
hypothetical problems until the final validation is achieved by checking 
against the actual speech of students’. 
The recorded data, as the phonetic output of each subject, were analysed. 
Following the analysis, all the errors were singled out and tables showing 
transcriptions of correct and incorrect forms were drawn up as shown in 
Chapter 4: Results and Analysis. 
The analysis of errors in this study was based on Rossipal’s model of error 
analysis (EA) as stated in Chapter 2: Theories of Second Language 
Acquisition. This model included six steps as follows.  
(a) types of errors 
(b) frequency of errors 
(c) points of difficulty in the target language 
(d) cause of errors 
(e) degree of disturbance caused by errors 
(f) therapy 
 
Apart from step (e), my analysis of Arabs’ errors in English pronunciation 
addressed Rossipal’s steps by: 
• 
diagnosing types of errors in the Arabic speakers’ English sounds 
and main word stress; 
• 
studying the frequency of Arabic speakers’ interlingual errors; 
• 
finding out the reasons for these errors; 
• 
suggesting some teaching recommendations for overcoming these 
errors. 
 
While analysing the subjects’ segmental and word stress errors, the 
following linguistic parameters were taken into account: 
A) Linguistic Parameters 
1) Proficiency level of English 
2) Reading versus pictures 
Finally, inter-judge reliability was used in this research – the subjects’ 
recordings were transcribed separately by the researcher who is a native 
Arabic speaker, and by a second transcriber who is a native English speaker 

Introduction 
 
33 
with experience in transcription. The two transcriptions were then compared 
and the few cases of disagreement were resolved by the two transcribers. 
1.4.4.2 Statistical Analysis  
In order to be able to better evaluate and compare the errors in English 
pronunciation and main word stress made by the Arab subjects whose 
phonetic output was analysed, it was necessary to examine the frequency of 
the different types of error. A frequency measure was applied by finding out 
what percentage of the target population got the item wrong. Means and 
different types of descriptive statistics are also used in this research. 
1.5 Chapter Summary 
This chapter shows that the current research is an error analysis of English 
pronunciation errors among Arabic speakers regarding consonants, 
consonant clusters, vowels and main word stress. Its aim is to find out 
their segmental and word stress errors, the reasons behind them and to 
present some teaching suggestions as remedial work. It is a contribution to 
the relatively understudied area of L2 phonology acquisition (L2 sounds 
and stress production). Its justification was also discussed as a sound basis 
for teaching English pronunciation to Arabic speakers. The key 
terminology of the research was defined: mistake, error, contrastive 
analysis, error analysis, interference, interlanguage and stress. Elicitation 
was the method used for this study. Forty five Arab subjects, who were 
postgraduate students living in Sheffield, England, took part and were 
assigned two tasks. The first task was a production test and its items were 
divided into three word groups (511 words total, 25 word classes), which 
were chosen on the basis of Arabic and English sounds, word stress 
placement rules and the expected areas of L1 transfer. The second task 
was a description of a picture. Finally, the linguistic background covered 
the Arabic language, dialect of the study, the Arab learner of English, 
TEFL in the Arab schools, English pronunciation problems and Arab 
learners and English stress and effective communication.  
The next chapter explains some theories of second language acquisition 
which are related to this study. The predictions based on these theories will 
be tested in Chapter 4: Results and Analysis. 
 

CHAPTER TWO 
THEORIES OF SECOND LANGUAGE 
ACQUISITION 
 
 
 
2.0 Introduction 
A number of different theories and hypotheses in the field of second 
language (L2) acquisition (Larsen-Freeman and Long (1991) estimate 
around 40) have been formed in an effort to provide explanations as to 
how L2 learning takes place, to identify the variables responsible for L2 
acquisition and to offer guidance to L2 teachers. Research in L2 
acquisition is closely related to several disciplines including linguistics, 
sociolinguistics, psychology, neuroscience and education, and consequently 
most theories of L2 acquisition can be identified as having roots in one of 
them. Each theory accounts for language acquisition from a different 
perspective and can be thought of as shedding light on one part of the 
language learning process. However, no one theory of L2 acquisition has 
yet been widely accepted by researchers.  
 This section includes three main points. First, it explains some theories of 
L2 acquisition: a description of each theory and its contribution to SLA 
research. These theories are Contrastive Analysis (CA) (Fries, 1945), Error 
Analysis (EA) (Corder, 1967), Markedness Theory (Eckman, 1977), 
Universal Grammar (UG) (Chomsky, 1981), Monitor Theory (Krashen, 
1985) and the Ontogeny Phylogeny Model (OPM) (Major, 2001). Second, 
it summarises these theories of L2 acquisition. Third, it presents some 
predictions based on these L2 theories. The theories discussed below 
(presented in chronological order) mainly focus on L2 phonology, 
especially L2 sounds and stress production which are more relevant to the 
current research. This chapter is based on Khalifa’s (2017) explanation of 
theories of L2 acquisition.  

Theories of Second Language Acquisition 
 
35 
2.1 Contrastive Analysis (CA) 
Contrastive linguistics plays an important role in the creation of language 
awareness (James, 2005; Mair, 2005). Judged by the rules of the source 
language (SL), learners regularly produce erroneous or ill-formed 
utterances. It was thought that errors could be corrected by repeating the 
explanations until the errors disappeared. This gave way to the idea that 
errors were an indication of the learner’s difficulties, which could be 
traced back to transfer of the mother tongue (MT) habits to the target 
language (TL). Lado (1957, 1) states that: 
(1) Individuals tend to transfer the forms and meanings and the distribution 
of forms and meanings of their native language and culture to the 
foreign language and culture – both productively when attempting to 
speak the language and act in the culture and receptively when 
attempting to grasp and understand the language and the culture as 
practised by natives. 
In this case, errors were to be dealt with by more intensive drilling of the 
sound patterns and sentence structure of the TL. Errors occurred because 
of interference and therefore a structural comparison or contrast between 
the MT and the TL could predict the learner’s difficulties (Broselow, 
1984). The belief that almost all errors had their origin in MT interference 
gave rise to Contrastive Analysis (henceforth, CA) (Fries, 1945; 
Weinreich, 1953; Lado, 1957). CA theory developed out of behaviourism, 
a theory in psychology and a foreign language teaching programme 
(Zampini, 2008).  
2.1.1 L1 and L2 Features 
The publication of Teaching and Learning English as a Foreign Language 
by Fries (1945) opened a new horizon in the study of SLA. Fries (1945, 9) 
assumes that ‘the most efficient materials [for foreign language teaching] 
are those that are based upon a scientific description of the language to be 
learned, carefully compared with a parallel description of the native 
language of the learner’. 
 It was thought that the greater the differences between the structures of 
the MT and the TL, the greater the problems and difficulties in learning 
and performance would be. Lado (1957, 2) explains these difficulties for 
the foreign learner, as follows: 
 

Chapter Two 
 
36 
(2) Those elements that are similar to his native language will be simple 
for him, and those elements that are different will be difficult. 
2.1.2 L1 Transfer 
Within CA, one major concept that is given a prevalent place and has 
contributed to the explanations of errors found in L2 learners is the 
concept of transfer (George, 1972; Dulay and Burt, 1974). Major (2008, 
64) states that ‘the fundamental claims of CA are that transfer explains all 
errors and on this basis it is possible to predict all errors’. Even though 
‘most L2 phonologists do not necessarily claim or admit that transfer is the 
focus of their work, transfer is implicated in almost every instance’ 
(Major, 2008, 83). Broselow (1983, 302-303) states that ‘language transfer 
does play a significant role in second language acquisition: certain 
systematic errors can be directly attributed to the use by language learners 
of a phonological rule in the production of second language forms’. Many 
studies conducted in L2 learning have dealt with transfer theory in great 
depth, because it was noticed that there exists a relation between ‘errors’ 
and ‘interference’. For example, George (1972) found out that one third of 
the errors found in his corpus could be explained via ‘negative transfer’ 
which has been referred to as ‘interference’. Selinker (1966, 103) defines 
transfer as ‘a process occurring from the native to the foreign language if 
frequency analysis shows that statistically significant trend in the 
speaker’s native language…is then paralleled by a significant trend toward 
the same alternative in the speaker’s attempted production of the foreign 
language sentences’. On the other hand, James (1980, 25) regards transfer 
as ‘the psychological corner of CA’. Zampini (2008, 2) states that ‘while 
other domains of SLA research such as morphology, syntax, and 
pragmatics have also focused on transfer, it is within the domain of L2 
phonology that transfer has been most heavily researched, due to the 
recognition that it is within this area of acquisition that transfer is most 
prevalent’.  
2.1.3 Types of L1 Transfer 
There are two types of language transfer: positive and negative transfer. 
This is pointed out by Gass and Selinker (1983, 821) who support the view 
that language transfer is  
(3) a technical term denoting ‘the positive’ interaction of two or more 
similar areas of language resulting in correct linguistic output (positive 
transfer) or denoting the negative interaction of two or more similar 

Theories of Second Language Acquisition 
 
37 
areas of language and languages resulting in incorrect linguistic output 
‘negative transfer’.  
According to Littlewood (1984), positive transfer is viewed when the L1 
structure equates the L2 structure. Therefore, the L2 learner ends up with 
correct performance, because the L1 structure has been seen as a 
facilitating tool in the process of L2. This is supported by Van Els et al 
(1984, 49), as follows. 
(4) Positive transfer, or facilitation, is a transfer of a skill X which 
facilitates the learning or has a positive influence on the command of a 
skill because of similarities between both skills.  
The second type of language transfer is ‘negative transfer’ and is defined 
by Van Els et al (ibid.), as follows.  
(5) [Negative transfer] is a transfer of a skill X which impedes the learning 
or has a negative influence on the command of a skill Y because of 
differences between both skills.  
Broselow (1984, 253) points out negative transfer by stating that ‘one 
would expect to find negative transfer operating in cases which, for 
example, the native language had a rule which the target language lacked. 
Thus a German speaker learning English might devoice final obstruents in 
English in accord with the rules of German phonology’. These two types 
of transfer (i.e. positive and negative) will be tested in Chapter 4: Results 
and Analysis, to see if they have affected the Arabic speakers’ 
interlanguage.  
2.1.4 Factors Affecting L1 Interference 
The phenomenon of interference has promoted a number of investigations 
to find out the factors that induce such phenomenon to occur. James (1980, 
146) points out the various factors that contribute to the occurrence of 
interference, as follows. 
(a) Amount and nature of L2 input: Interference occurs when the L2 
learner’s input is very limited in both ‘quantity’ and ‘scope’. This 
phenomenon can be manifested especially when L2 is learned in an 
L1 environment (schools). 
(b) Level of linguistic analysis: Most research has been done at the 
levels of morphology and syntax rather than at the phonological 
and lexical level. It is because of these two levels that ‘interference’ 

Chapter Two 
 
38 
as a linguistic term has been included in the literature.  
(c) Linguistic distance between L1 and L2: Related linguistic systems 
induce the interference phenomenon to manifest itself. Hence, since 
the two languages are different, L2 learners have a tendency to 
translate the features from L1 into L2.  
(d) L2 learning stage: Taylor (1975) pointed out that interference 
phenomenon is more frequent among beginners than among 
advanced learners during the L2 learning process.  
(e) Task focus: Interference is common among L2 learners if the focus 
of L2 is on grammatical forms rather than on ‘communicative 
effectiveness’.  
 
In Chapter 4: Results and Analysis, these factors will be considered 
alongside L1 transfer as possible explanations for the Arabic speakers’ 
segmental and word stress errors.  
2.1.5 Criticism of Contrastive Analysis 
Despite the fact that CA has raised some fundamental issues in language 
learning, by the 1970s people started questioning its validity. There have 
been doubts about the status and applicability of contrastive linguistic 
studies to language teaching (Ritchie, 1967; Nemser, 1971; Slama-Cazacu, 
1971; Dulay and Burt, 1974). This is due to many reasons: 
1)  Difficulties predicted by CA were not always found to be so 
(Nickel, 1971): 
 •  Where there were similarities between the languages, errors 
occurred although CA predicted no difficulty (Major, 2008). 
 •  Where there were big differences between the languages, errors 
often did not occur although CA predicted difficulty (Broselow, 
1984). 
 
2)  Not all difficulties and errors arise from the influence of the MT 
(Dušková, 1969; Richards, 1971; Dulay and Burt, 1973; Broselow, 
1984; Swan, 1997; Ellis, 2008). This is also pointed out by 
Broselow (1983, 292) who states that ‘it is certain that many factors 
other than transfer from the first language are involved in 
phonological errors made by language learners’.  
 
3)  Adequate comparisons of languages were faced with purely 
theoretical problems which made the whole operation of doubtful 
validity (Hamp, 1965; Van Buren, 1974; Krzeszowski, 1974). 

Theories of Second Language Acquisition 
 
39 
As a result, there was a reappraisal of the theoretical basis for such studies 
and its value for language teaching. Wardhaugh (1970) distinguished 
between the strong and weak hypothesis of CA: 
 
•  The strong hypothesis stated that a systematic CA could predict the 
learner’s difficulties and remedial teaching materials could then be 
devised. 
•  The weak hypothesis stated that a comparison between the MT and 
the SL might help to explain the difficulties evident from the 
learner’s errors. 
 
Nehls (1974) and James (1971) have made a reasoned reply to all these 
criticisms. James argues that many of the claims for which the analysts are 
attacked have never been made by them. Indeed, since 1968 contrastive 
analysts have gradually abandoned the stronger claims. In addition, 
research in this area has broadened its scope in two directions towards: 
1)  more theoretical objectives in language typology and the search for 
universals; 
2)  psycholinguistic explanation of second language acquisition. 
 
The weakness of contrastive analysis was pointed out by Broselow (1983, 
292), as follows. 
(6) The failure to predict errors from an examination of the linguistic 
systems of the first and second languages by no means constitutes 
sufficient grounds for abandoning the contrastive analysis hypothesis 
altogether….and it is likely that a more sophisticated linguistic theory 
may in fact allow us to predict many of the systematic phonological 
errors made by speakers of a second language.  
Ellis (1994, 308) states that ‘it was not surprising to see contrastive 
analysis lose ground to error analysis in the 1970s’. Here the broadened 
CA merged with EA. 
2.2 Error Analysis (EA) 
2.2.1 Contrastive and Error Analysis 
Contrastive Analysis (CA) worked well on the phonological level but 
failed to predict errors in other areas. This led to a growing interest in 
Error Analysis (henceforth, EA), which was established in the 1960s by 
Stephen Pit Corder and colleagues. EA was an alternative to CA which 

Chapter Two 
 
40 
was abandoned by linguists and teachers due to its ineffectiveness and 
unreliability. EA showed that CA was unable to predict a great majority of 
errors, although its more valuable aspects have been incorporated into the 
study of language transfer. EA started with the errors and then tried to find 
out their causes. James (1998, 1) defines Error Analysis ‘as the process of 
determining the incidence, nature, causes and consequences of unsuccessful 
language’. EA is also referred to as the study of linguistic ignorance which 
investigates ‘what people do not know and how they attempt to cope with 
their ignorance’ (James, 1998, 62-63). The fact that L2 learners find ways 
to cope with their linguistic ignorance makes a connection between EA 
and L2 learners’ strategies. A key finding of EA has been that many 
learners’ errors are produced by learners making faulty inferences about 
the rules of the new language. Writers highlighted the points of weakness 
of CA (Richards, 1974; Dulay and Burt, 1975; Broselow, 1984; and many 
others) and pressed the claims of EA. But they should have concentrated 
more on errors not caused by MT interference which CA failed to predict. 
Early works in EA dealing with L2 data were taxonomic in the sense that 
they focused on collecting and classifying errors (James, 1998). For a 
time, the literature on EA tried to prove the existence of numerous errors 
not caused by MT interference.  
Corder (1975, 207) suggests that Error Analysis can be distinguished from 
‘performance analysis’ in the sense that ‘performance analysis is the study 
of the whole performance data from individual learners, whereas the term 
EA is reserved for the study of erroneous utterances produced by groups of 
learners’. In both analyses ‘the learners’ errors are a register of their 
current perspective on the TL’ (James, 1998, 7). 
2.2.2 Significance of Learners’ Errors 
James (1998, 12) gives Corder’s five crucial points, originally published in 
Corder’s (1967) paper titled ‘The Significance of Learners’ Errors’, as 
follows. 
(7) 1. L1 acquisition and L2 learning are parallel processes, they are ruled 
by the same mechanisms, procedures and strategies. Learning an L2 is 
probably facilitated by the knowledge of the L1. 
  
2. Errors reflect the learners’ inbuilt syllabus or what they have taken 
in, but not what the teachers have put into them. So there is a 
difference between ‘input’ and ‘intake’. 
 
3. Errors show that both learners of L1 and L2 develop an independent 
language system – a ‘transitional competence’. 
 
4. The terms ‘error’ and ‘mistake’ should not be used interchangeably. 

Theories of Second Language Acquisition 
 
41 
 
5. Errors are important because they (a) tell the teacher what he or she 
should teach, (b) are a source of information for the researcher about 
how the learning proceeds, and (c) allow the learners to test their L2 
hypotheses. 
 
 Attitudes towards errors, aims of Error Analysis, the process of Error 
Analysis and models of Error Analysis are now explained. Finally, the 
criticism of Error Analysis is presented. 
2.2.3 Attitudes towards Errors 
Attitudes towards language learners’ errors vary greatly. According to 
Corder (1967), there are two schools of thought towards these errors: 
(1) The first school considers the occurrence of errors as nothing but a 
sign of the present inadequacy of our teaching techniques. That is, 
if the teaching methods were perfect, errors would never occur. 
(2) The second school believes that we live in an imperfect world and 
however great our efforts, errors will always occur. Thus, we 
should concentrate on devising suitable remedial techniques for 
dealing with these errors. 
 
In this research, I agree with the second school and the Arabic speakers’ 
English segmental and main word stress errors are analysed and remedial 
measures are suggested. Although I agree that the better the method of 
teaching, the fewer the learner’s errors, I disagree with the first school, as 
it is impossible to find a perfect method of teaching without errors. 
However perfect the method may be, the learner’s part can not be ignored. 
In other words, a perfect teacher’s efforts will be useless with an 
inattentive or indifferent learner. 
2.2.4 Aims of Error Analysis 
There are a number of general statements which explain clearly what EA 
is concerned with: Nickel (1972) in German; Lange (1974) in French; and 
Corder (1973), Svartik (1973), Richards and Sampson (1974), and 
Schumann and Stenson (1975) in English. Whereas CA concentrates only 
on the cases of interlingual transfer, EA is concerned with both inter- and 
intralingual errors. The aims of EA range from the practical to the 
theoretical side. Hammarberg (1979, 108) states that Rossipal (1972, 110) 
hopes that EA may provide relevant data within the following areas: 

Chapter Two 
 
42 
(8)   • contrastive language description, prediction of potential interference; 
 • improving the description of the target language; 
 • describing general traits of linguistic errors; 
 • describing linguistic universals; 
 • improving language teaching. 
2.2.5 The Process of Error Analysis 
Pedagogically, in order to know the principal learning difficulties of 
groups of learners, we need to apply three stages (Corder, 1975): 
a) Classification of errors; 
b) Evaluation of errors; 
c) Explanation of errors. 
 
This is in line with James (1998), 5) who explains that EA ‘involves first 
independently or ‘objectively’ describing learners’ IL…and the TL itself, 
followed by a comparison of the two, so as to locate mismatches’. Each 
stage will now be discussed in detail. 
2.2.5.1 Classification of Errors 
Traditionally, errors were classified into four categories: 
• Errors of omission: e.g. *I was not afraid the dog. 
• Errors of addition: e.g. *He did not let me to go. 
• Errors of substitution: e.g. *That lady is our new typewriter. 
• Errors of ordering: e.g. *I asked her how was she. 
 
In my view, such a classification is far from sufficient due to the following 
reasons: 
• 
The items omitted, added, etc. need to be assigned to more general 
classes: prepositions, tense forms, questions, and so on, to be of 
benefit to the learner and to explain difficulties. 
•  It depends on our interpretation whether we regard an error as 
being one of e.g. omission or substitution. For example, *Dog is a 
faithful animal can be classified under omission of definite article: 
The dog is a faithful animal or substitution of singular nouns for 
plural: Dogs are faithful animals. 
 
Corder (1981, 36) describes this classification, as follows: 
 

Theories of Second Language Acquisition 
 
43 
(9) This superficial classification of errors is only a starting point for 
systematic analysis. It is only the evidence or data for an analysis. It is 
usual for teachers to go a bit further in their classification. They will 
usually state at what linguistic level the error has been committed. 
A more adequate classification of errors, then, involves assigning them to 
various levels of linguistic description, i.e. phonological (both speaking 
and listening), orthographic (spelling and punctuation), syntactic 
(grammatical), lexico-semantic (choice of vocabulary), and situational or 
socio-linguistic (appropriacy). These levels, in turn, can be sub-classified 
as systems, e.g. vowel or consonant systems, tense, aspect, number, gender 
or case. 
 Such classification is more abstract and systematic. But again one error 
may be assigned to more than one level of description depending on 
interpretation and reconstruction e.g. *Please bring me a flour. This error 
may be classified as syntactic (substitution of a for some), or lexical or 
phonological (substitution of flour for flower). 
 More recent classifications describe errors in terms of violations of the 
grammatical or phonological rules according to various generative and 
transformational models of description. 
Of all the various classifications of errors, I follow the one based on the 
various levels of linguistic description (phonology). The subjects’ 
segmental and main word stress errors are classified as errors in 
consonants, consonant clusters, vowels, simple word stress and compound 
word stress. 
2.2.5.2 Evaluation of Errors 
The demand for accurate evaluation of errors arises from the need to: 
• assess the learner’s knowledge for grading/marking purposes; 
• assign priorities to remedial procedures. 
 
There are various linguistic approaches to the evaluation of error gravity: 
 a) James (1974) evaluates the degree of deviance of an error from the 
correct TL by assessing the number and nature of the rules violated. 
 b) Burt and Kiparsky (1975) differentiate between two types of errors: 
global and local. 
• Global errors are deviations in the overall structure of sentences. 
• Local errors are deviations in the structure of constituents of 

Chapter Two 
 
44 
simple sentences and subordinate clauses. 
 c) Johanssen (1973) evaluates how much an error may disturb the 
effectiveness of communication according to its frequency, 
generality or comprehensibility. In addition, some researchers 
(Lindell, 1973; Olsson, 1973; James, 1975; among others) measure 
error gravity by the degree of tolerance shown towards it by native 
speakers or language teachers.  
 
My evaluation of the subjects’ segmental and word stress errors follows 
James (1974) with particular attention to MT interference. I also follow 
Burt and Kiparsky (1975) regarding ‘local errors’ only, by studying the 
Arabic speakers’ phonological deviations concerning English sounds and 
main word stress. 
2.2.5.3 Explanation of Errors 
Richards, J. C. (1971) identifies three main causes of error: 
• Interlingual causes of error; 
• Intralingual causes of error; 
• Faulty teaching techniques or materials. 
 
This agrees with Eckman (2008,101) who states that ‘it has been 
recognized since the early days of Error Analysis (Schachter, 1974) that 
learners’ errors are not the only measure of difficulty, and at times may not 
even be the most reliable measure’. The causes above are discussed in 
Chapter 1, p. 13. The current research investigates the interlingual causes 
in detail and the intralingual and teaching causes in brief. 
2.2.6 Models of Error Analysis 
According to Nickel (1972, 11), these are the three main aspects of the 
study of errors: 
(10) a) description; 
  
 b) grading; 
  
 c) therapy. 
 
Another model of error analysis is pointed out by Rossipal (1972, 109), as 
follows: 
(11) a) types of errors; 
 
 b) frequency of errors; 

Theories of Second Language Acquisition 
 
45 
 
 c) points of difficulty in the target language; 
 
 d) cause of errors; 
 
 e) degree of disturbance caused by errors; 
 
 f) therapy. 
 
In my view, however comprehensive these models may be, they miss out a 
further step: checking the effectiveness of the therapy. This can be done by 
having a regular reanalysis of the learner’s errors and a reassessment of the 
remedial measures. Without this step, the learner will be like a patient 
given medication without being followed up. This research follows 
Rossipal’s model in a slightly different way by (a) analysing points of 
difficulty in the TL (English) due to MT (Arabic) interference and (b) not 
studying the degree of disturbance (error gravity) caused by the errors. 
Arabic speakers’ errors in English pronunciation are analysed by (a) 
diagnosing areas and types of English segmental and word stress errors 
among the Arabic speakers, (b) studying the frequency of the Arabic 
speakers’ interlingual errors, (c) finding out the reasons for these errors and 
(d) suggesting some teaching recommendations for overcoming these errors. 
2.2.7 Criticism of Error Analysis 
Bell (1974, 35) criticises EA by calling it ‘a recent pseudoprocedure in 
applied linguistics’. In his opinion, the EA data are of only poor statistical 
inference, errors are usually interpreted subjectively and it lacks 
predicative power. Schachter (1974) also criticises EA by pointing out that 
EA does not take into consideration the strategy of avoidance, i.e. that 
learners tend to avoid certain language items which they are not sure about 
and so they do not make errors in the areas where they would be expected 
to make them. More criticism comes from Dulay et al (1982, 141-143) 
who point to the fact that ‘EA confuses explanatory and descriptive 
aspects, in other words the process and the product; and also that error 
categories lack precision and specificity’. In addition, Larson-Freeman and 
Long (1991, 61) state that ‘Error Analysis as a mode of inquiry was 
limited in its scope and concentrated on what learners did wrong rather 
than on what made them successful’. In that respect, EA is limited in its 
explanatory power. Finally, Cook (1993, 2) considers EA as ‘a methodology 
for dealing with data’ rather than a theory that explains the process of L2 
acquisition. However, despite all the criticism, EA remains widely used, 
because it has proven to be an effective approach to L2 learners’ errors. 
 The next section explains a different theory of L2 acquisition (i.e. 
markedness theory) which does not rely on L1-L2 differences only, but 

Chapter Two 
 
46 
takes into consideration both L1 transfer and language universals. 
2.3 Markedness Theory 
2.3.1 Definition of Markedness 
The markedness theory explains the role of typological markedness in the 
explanation of facts about L2 phonology (Eckman, 2008) and takes into 
account both native language transfer and language universals (Zampini, 
2008). Markedness universals deal with occurrences and likelihood of 
occurrences of phenomena (Major, 2008). Markedness is defined in 
various ways (Chomsky and Halle, 1968; Hyman, 1975; Greenberg, 1978; 
Hawkins, 1984; Carr, 1993). One definition employs ‘implicational 
hierarchies: x is more marked than y if the presence of x implies the 
presence of y but not vice versa’ (Major, 2008). Markedness is explained 
by Eckman (1987, 60), as follows: ‘a phenomenon A in some language is 
considered to be more marked than a phenomenon B if the presence of A 
in a language implies the presence of B, but the presence if B does not 
imply the presence of A’. For example, final voiced obstruents imply 
voiced obstruents in initial and medial position but not vice versa 
(Eckman, 1977, 1985; Eckman and Iverson, 1994). Markedness can also 
refer to statistical frequencies. In L1 acquisition, markedness means that 
less marked phenomena are acquired before more marked phenomena. 
Eckman (2008, 96) explains the principle of markedness, as follows. 
(12) The idea behind this concept was that binary oppositions between 
certain linguistic representations (e.g. voiced and voiceless obstruents, 
nasalized and oral vowels, open and closed syllables) were not taken to 
be simply polar opposites. Rather, one member of the opposition was 
assumed to be privileged in that it had a wider distribution, both within 
a given language and cross languages … the member of the opposition 
that was more widely distributed than the other was designated as 
unmarked, including that it was, in some definable way, simpler, more 
basic and more natural than the other member of the opposition, which 
was in turn defined as the marked member. 
Linguists have been able to apply typological markedness to virtually all 
kinds of linguistic expressions, including phonological, lexical, morphological 
and syntactic structures. This section focuses on the role of markedness in 
L2 phonology, more specifically, the claim that marked structures are more 
difficult to learn than the corresponding unmarked structures (Eckman, 
2008). 

Theories of Second Language Acquisition 
 
47 
2.3.2 Markedness Hypotheses 
There are two hypotheses relevant to L2 phonology that have been 
formulated using the construct of typological markedness: the Markedness 
Differential Hypothesis (MDH) (Eckman, 1977) and the Structural 
Conformity Hypothesis (SCH) (Eckman, 1991). Each hypothesis is now 
considered in turn. 
2.3.2.1 Markedness Differential Hypothesis (MDH) 
Major research findings have shown that predicting areas of difficulty and 
explaining L2 phonological acquisition is much more complex than a 
straightforward contrastive analysis of the first language and the second 
(Zampini, 2008). Eckman’s (1977) Markedness Differential Hypothesis is, 
in fact, a reformulation of the Contrastive Analysis Hypothesis (CAH) 
(Lado, 1957) by incorporating the notion of typological markedness into 
CAH. Therefore, unlike the CAH, which predicts that different L2 sounds 
will be difficult to learn, the MDH postulates that different sounds are only 
difficult to learn if they are typologically marked; if typologically 
unmarked, these sounds should not create learning difficulty. That is, the 
more marked a rule, the more difficult it is to learn. Eckman (1977, 321) 
proposes the MDH, as follows. 
(13) The Markedness Differential Hypothesis (MDH)  
 
The areas of difficulty that a language learner will have can be 
predicted such that 
(a) Those areas of the target language which differ from the native 
language and are more marked than the native language will be 
difficult. 
(b) The relative degree of difficulty of the areas of the target language 
which are more marked than the native language will correspond to the 
relative degree of markedness.  
 (c) Those areas of the target language which are different from the native 
language, but are not more marked than the native language will not be 
difficult. 
 
The MDH in (13) predicts that (a) marked L2 patterns are more difficult to 
learn than unmarked ones, (b) marked L2 patterns that are less marked 
than the patterns of the mother tongue are not difficult to learn, and (c) 
marked L1 patterns are less likely to be transferred than unmarked ones. 
This shows that not all L1-L2 differences will cause equal difficulty for 
the L2 learner (Eckman, 2008). The MDH asserts that, within the areas of 
difference between the L1 and L2, marked structures are more difficult to 
acquire than the corresponding unmarked structures. The kind of evidence 

Chapter Two 
 
48 
adduced in support of the MDH showed that L2 learner’s errors could not 
be accounted for on the basis of L1-L2 differences alone, but that 
typological markedness was necessary to explain the difficulty that L2 
learners encountered (Eckman, 2008). Major (2008) points out that 
numerous predictions of the MDH have been found to be true, for 
example, in studies of voicing contrasts (Yavas, 1994; Major and Faudree, 
1996), epenthesis in initial consonant clusters in Egyptian learners of 
English (Broselow, 1983), fossilisation in Brunei English (Mossop, 1996) 
and speech pathology (Gierut, 1986; Hodson and Edwards, 1997). 
 The MDH and its typological markedness approach received some 
criticism. Eckman (2008, 100) states that ‘the methodological issues that 
have confronted the MDH in the literature on L2 phonology stem from the 
fact that the MDH is completely programmatic with the Contrastive 
Analysis Hypothesis (CAH) in two important respects. First, both the 
MDH and the CAH make claims about L2 learning difficulty, and second, 
both hypotheses base their claims about such difficulty, at least in part, on 
the areas of difference between the NL: and TL’. There were two 
problems with the MDH. First, how one measures learning difficulty. 
Second, as Eckman (2008, 101) points out ‘some reported error patterns 
corresponded directly to markedness principles, but the errors did not 
occur in an area of difference between the NL and TL. In this situation, the 
spirit of the MDH seemed to be invoked, in that more marked structures 
caused more errors than the corresponding less marked structures; 
however, the letter of the MDH prevented the hypothesis from making any 
predictions’. Regarding the first problem, Eckman (2008) explains that the 
vast majority of work in L2 phonology has measured difficulty in terms of 
learner’s errors: the more errors made on a structure, the more difficult 
that structure is interpreted to be. However, learner’s errors are not the 
only measure of difficulty and at times may not even be the most reliable 
measure (Schachter, 1974). Therefore, the Similarity Differential Rate 
Hypothesis (Major and Kim, 1996) addressed this problem by considering 
rate of acquisition, rather than difficulty, as a more insightful measure of 
learning. To deal with the first problem, above and the second problem 
with the MDH (i.e. that NL-TL differences are crucial to the predictions), 
Eckman (2008) formulated an alternative hypothesis: the Structural 
Conformity Hypothesis (SCH), which is now discussed. 
2.3.2.2 Structural Conformity Hypothesis (SCH) 
Eckman (2008, 107) points out that ‘the Structural Conformity Hypothesis 
addresses the shortcomings of the Markedness Differential hypothesis. 

Theories of Second Language Acquisition 
 
49 
First, by making predictions about the nature of interlanguage grammars 
rather than about learning difficulty, and second, by expanding the domain 
of the hypothesis beyond only areas of difference between the NL and TL. 
The SCH simply asserts that ILs will obey the same universal 
generalizations as primary languages’. The SCH is stated by (Eckman, 
1991, 24), as follows. 
(14) The Structural Conformity Hypothesis (SCH) 
 
The universal generalizations that hold for primary languages hold also 
for interlanguages. 
 
The strongest kind of evidence that has been adduced in support of the 
SCH is an interlanguage pattern that is neither NL-like nor TL-like, but 
nevertheless obeys the kinds of universal patterns found in some of the 
world’s languages. Eckman (1991), Carlisle (1997, 1998) and Eckman and 
Iverson (1994) are examples of this evidence. Each of these studies 
considered the case of consonant clusters in onsets or codas, where the TL 
allowed both a greater number of clusters, as well as more marked 
clusters, than did the NL. According to Eckman (2008), these studies 
supporting the SCH had one point in common: in each instance the IL 
grammars contained cluster types that were more complex than those 
allowed by the NL, but not as complex as those required by the TL. In this 
respect, the IL grammars fell between the NL and TL, but always did so in 
a way that was in conformity with the applicable universal generalisations. 
2.3.3 Criticism of Markedness Theory 
The SCH has provided an explanation for a number of different facts about 
L2 phonology, however, some SLA researchers have taken the position 
that markedness, in general, and the SCH, in particular, are not viable 
explanatory principles. There are two main arguments for this position. 
The first is that markedness itself is simply a fact to be explained, and as 
such does not offer an explanation. This position is taken by Archibald 
(1998, 150) and is stated in (15). 
(15) My general assessment of this sort of typological universals approach 
to second language acquisition is that it provides an interesting 
description of the phenomena to be explained. I’m less sure of their 
status as an explanation of the observed facts. All in all, I prefer to 
assume some sort of structural explanation. 
The second position was taken by Gass and Selinker (2001, 154) who 
assert that invoking typological universals as explanatory principles raises 

Chapter Two 
 
50 
more questions than it answers. This position is represented in (16). 
(16) For implicational universals to have any importance in the study of 
second language acquisition, two factors must be taken into 
consideration. First, one must understand why a universal is universal. 
It is not sufficient to state that second languages obey natural language 
constraints because that is the way languages are. This only pushes the 
problem of explanation back one step. 
Despite the criticism of the Markedness Differential Hypothesis (MDH) 
and the Structural Conformity Hypothesis (SCH), these two hypotheses 
have had considerable influence in the literature on L2 speech production 
(Zampini, 2008). In addition, typological markedness has played a 
significant role in the explanation of facts about L2 phonology and the 
markedness theory will be used to explain the difficulties faced by the 
Arabic speakers regarding stress production. 
 The next section explains a different and very common theory of L2 
acquisition (i.e. Universal Grammar) which shows how L2 acquisition 
occurs on the basis of L1 acquisition (Chomsky, 1981). 
2.4 Universal Grammar (UG) 
Universal Grammar (UG) is the most influential theory of language 
acquisition. In this linguistic theory (UG), Chomsky (1981) tried to 
explain not only what constitutes knowledge of language, but also how 
this knowledge of language is acquired. UG challenged the behavioural 
model (Skinner, 1959) which proposed that human infants are born with 
blank sheets in their minds, and that through the process of stimulation, 
response and reinforcement, children gradually get in mind the vocabulary 
and grammar of their mother tongue.  
2.4.1 Principles and Parameters 
Universal Grammar consists of a set of principles, which are common to 
all languages (i.e. basic properties which all languages share), and a set of 
parameters, which have language-specific values (i.e. properties which can 
vary between languages). Grammars of individual languages are therefore 
the result of the variation of the settings of the different parameters plus 
language-specific rules. Cook (1991, 34) states that ‘Universal Grammar 
(UG) sees the knowledge of a grammar in the mind as made up of two 
components: ‘principles’ that all languages have in common and 

Theories of Second Language Acquisition 
 
51 
‘parameters’ on which they vary. All human minds are believed to honour 
the common principles that are forced on them by the nature of human 
minds that all their speakers share. They differ over the settings of their 
parameters for particular languages’. 
Cook and Newson (1996, 81) suggest the following diagrams as an 
attempt to determine the components of a UG model of L2 learning. 
Figure 1: The Components of a UG Model of L2 Learning (Cook and Newson, 
1996, 81) 
 
For example, a ‘principle’ says that all sentences in all languages have 
subjects. Even those sentences without obvious subjects have their implicit 
subjects either semantically or syntactically. For the ‘subject’ matter, there 
is a ‘parameter’ called ‘pro-drop’, which determines whether in a specific 
language, the subject of a sentence should be obviously present or not.  
2.4.2 Language Acquisition Device (LAD) 
In UG, Chomsky proposes that all people have an innate, biological ability 
to acquire a language and that they possess a Language Acquisition 
Device (LAD), a sort of neurological wiring that, regardless of the 
language to be acquired, allows a child to listen to a language, decipher the 
rules of that language, and begin creating with the language at a very 
young age. With the LAD they are able to make or understand utterances 
that they have not previously heard. Their first language is acquired with 
no direct instruction, no practice, no drills and with no apparent difficulty. 
This proposes that the human mind must have some built- in mechanism 
that helps the learner in the process of acquisition. This built-in 
mechanism is referred to as Universal Grammar and is sometimes 
substituted by ‘mental grammar’ (Ellis, 1985; Fortos, 2001). 

Chapter Two 
 
52 
 Originally, UG theory did not concern itself with L2 learning (L1 
acquisition only). However, Chomsky suggests that, if provided with the 
correct input, the LAD predisposes all people to the acquisition of a 
second language in basically the same L1 manner. Cook (1991, 117) states 
that ‘learning in the UG model is a straightforward matter of getting the 
right input. In this theory language input is the evidence out of which the 
learner constructs knowledge of language’. The UG principles were 
adopted by second language researches and were applied in the field of L2 
acquisition. From a UG perspective, learning the grammar of a second 
language is simply a matter of setting the correct L2 parameters. This 
suggests that the L2 Arab learners of English can successfully acquire the 
L2 English stress production if they set the correct L2 English stress 
parameters. Universal Grammar also provides a succinct explanation for 
much of the phenomenon of language transfer (Hilles, 1986). For example, 
Spanish and Arabic learners of English who make the mistake ‘Is raining’ 
instead of ‘It is raining’ have not yet set their pro-drop parameters 
correctly and are still using the same setting as in Spanish and Arabic 
respectively. 
2.4.3 Second Language Access to UG 
Evidence was provided that adults have some sort of access to knowledge 
of UG and this knowledge is used in the development of foreign language 
competence (Bley-Vroman, Felix and Joup, 1988). The argument in favour 
of UG in first language is almost equally valid for L2 learners who can 
attain high levels of linguistic knowledge which cannot be attributed to 
input or instruction alone. Felix (1988, 286-287), for instance, shows that 
L2 learners do have access to UG principles ‘which are neither learnable 
on positive evidence nor transferable from corresponding structures of the 
learner’s mother tongue’. Similarly, Bulut (1996) and Cem (1996) report 
that advanced Turkish learners of English are able to acquire the L2 
reflexive system which cannot be attributed to grammar instruction nor to 
input alone. Linguists have been debating for a long time over this issue: 
whether UG applies to L2 acquisition as it is the case in L1 acquisition. As 
Ellis (1994) points out, it is difficult to reach a ‘verdict’ among these 
different studies. However there are four different, opposite sometimes, 
positions on the accessibility of UG in L2 acquisition. These four positions 
are the direct access model, the indirect access model, the no-access model 
and the dual model. Cook (1985, 12), proposes three possibilities using the 
following diagram. 
 

Theories of Second Language Acquisition 
 
53 
Figure 2: Access to Universal Grammar in L2 Acquisition (Cook, 1985, 12) 
 
Each one of the four positions is now discussed in detail. 
2.4.3.1 The Direct Access Model 
In the direct access model, some researchers (e.g. Ritchie, 1978; Otsu and 
Naoi, 1986) believe that UG is available directly to L2 learners in the 
sense that they have access to it separately from the L1. According to 
Cook (1993), in this model, L2 learners learn exactly the same way as L1 
learners; they set values for parameters according to the L2 evidence they 
encounter without any other influence. The studies that support this model, 
tested the availability of some principles in learning some L2 properties by 
L2 learners which do not exist in their L1. For example, Otsu and Naoi 
(1986) studied Japanese L1 learners of L2 English by testing the operation 
of the Subject-Dependency Principle in the L2 English. The subjects were 
11 female teenagers (ages 14 – 15) who had studied English for two years. 
The results strongly supported Otsu and Naoi’s claim of L2 learners’ 
direct access to UG. They found that most of the subjects were guided by 
UG and produced the tested L2 English items correctly. However, some of 
those who deny that UG is available for L2 restrict their claim to adult L2 
learners and consider that the subjects of this study were too young. 
Another study by Ritchie (1978) supported this direct access model. 
Ritchie has tested the Right Roof Constraint (RRC) and used a 
grammaticality judgement test. He found that the RRC was operating and 
suggested that UG was accessible to his subjects. However, similar to Otsu 
and Naoi, (1986), his study was rejected by some researchers, because 
most of his subjects were not adult. Although these two studies received 
some criticism, they seem to support the suggestion that the 

Chapter Two 
 
54 
Underdetermination Principle (i.e. L1 acquirers produce sentences that 
they have never heard before) which is used as an evidence of the role of 
UG in L1 acquisition, is also available in L2 acquisition. In addition, the 
subjects in these studies showed the ability of L2 learners to produce 
sentences that they (a) do not have in their L1 and (b) did not learn in the 
L2. 
2.4.3.2 The Indirect Access Model 
In the indirect access model, researchers (e.g. White, 1986; Flynn, 1987) 
propose that UG operates in L2 acquisition, but via the L1. In other words, 
L2 learners start with the L1 principles and parameters, then they try to 
reset the L1 parameters when their parametric values differ from the L2 
(Cook, 1993). This happens on the base of L2 input and with activity of 
UG. White (1986) investigated the ‘pro-drop’ parameter in adult L2 
acquisition by comparing French learners with Spanish learners of English 
(French and English are non-pro-drop languages, while Spanish is a pro-
drop language). She found that L2 Spanish learners of English, at first 
stages, produced sentences with null subject much more than L2 French 
learners of English. She concluded that L2 Spanish learners had been 
influenced by their L1 parameters especially at first stages. 
2.4.3.3 The No-Access Model 
In the no-access model, UG is not available to L2 learners. In other words, 
UG is accessible to L1 parameters only and the parameter settings in the 
L1 cannot be reset for L2 acquisition (i.e. UG has nothing to do with L2 
learning at all (Cook, 1993)). Researchers (e.g. Clahsen and Muysken, 
1986; Schachter, 1988, 1989), who support this model, claim that there are 
major differences between L1 and L2 acquisition. Clahsen and Muysken 
(1986) investigated the availability of Universal Grammar to adult and 
child learners by comparing the acquisition of the word order in German 
by German children with L2 learners from different L1 backgrounds. 
Their study has shown that children start with subject-object-verb (SOV) 
order and gradually acquire subject-verb-object (SVO) order, whereas L2 
learners start with SVO and learn SOV. They argue that, in the case of 
children, this is because of ‘learning capacities specified to languages’, but 
in the case of adults, (Clahsen and Muysken, 1986, 111) refer to 
‘acquisition strategies which may be derived from principles of 
information processing and general problem solving strategies’. Schachter 
(1988, 1989) tested the accessibility of the Subjacency principle through 
grammaticality judgement test. The results supported the claim that UG is 

Theories of Second Language Acquisition 
 
55 
unavailable to L2 learners, since they did not use the principle for 
structures that they knew. Bley-Vroman (1989) has argued also that if 
there is inefficiency in L2 learning, it is because L2 learners do not have 
UG available to them and they acquire L2 through other mental processes. 
2.4.3.4 The Duel Model 
The duel model (Ellis, 1994) is also named ‘the competition model’ by 
Felix (1985). This model suggests that L2 learners have partial access to 
UG. According to these two researchers, the language specific system, 
which is equivalent to UG, and the problem solving system enter into 
competition for acquisition in light of L2 input. While children have 
complete access to UG only which enables them to achieve full 
competence, adults’ access to UG is blocked by using the problem solving 
system. This accounts for the fact that adults do not succeed in having 
native-like competence. 
 The models and studies above show that the question of availability of 
UG in L2 acquisition is not clear. There are different (sometimes opposite) 
opinions in these studies. This suggests that it is not an easy task to 
measure the L2 learner’s competence or to be sure of access to UG in L2 
acquisition. However, most of the researchers in this area stand between 
the indirect access position and the no-access position. 
2.4.4 Criticism of Universal Grammar 
There are some advocates and critics of Universal Grammar as a theory of 
L2 acquisition, although researchers have used UG to generate a number 
of interesting hypotheses about second language acquisition. Generative 
theorists regard UG as the best theory of grammar because of its 
descriptive and explanatory adequacy (Ellis, 1994). It is also suggested by 
(Ellis, 1985) that UG has helped to overcome one of the major problems of 
contrastive analysis by restricting the effects of L1 transfer to ‘non-core’ 
features or parameters. This means that UG can be used to help predict 
which differences between L1 and L2 result in L2 learning difficulties. 
Brown (2007, 214) advocates UG by stating that ‘the hope is that by 
discovering innate linguistic principles that govern what is possible in 
human languages, we may be better able to understand and describe 
contrasts between native and target languages and the difficulties 
encountered by adult second language learners. Research on UG has 
begun to identify such universal properties and principles, and therefore 
represents an avenue of some promise’. Fortos (2001, 269) also mentions 

Chapter Two 
 
56 
that Chomsky in the 1980s developed a ‘radically different way of looking 
at grammar which has become popular in recent years; a grammar tries to 
see what human languages have in common because of the nature of the 
human mind’. However, other researchers such as McLaughlin (1987) 
criticises UG theory because its empirical evidence has been restricted to 
the acquisition of a small set of syntactic phenomena, whereas a general 
theory of L2 needs to cover a wider range of phenomena. Even the fervent 
advocates of UG such as Pinker and Jackendoff turn out to be hard line 
reductionists when it comes to the role of UG in SLA. In addition, still for 
many UG theorists innate mechanisms for language acquisition atrophies 
especially after puberty which is generally assumed to be the critical 
period for natural language acquisition (Gregg, 1984; Bley-Vroman, 1988; 
Clashen and Muysken, 1989). Finally, the main shortcoming of UG in 
describing L2 acquisition is that it does not deal with the psychological 
processes involved in learning a language. UG is only concerned with 
whether parameters are set or not, not with how they are set. 
In recent years, some phonologists have favoured an Optimality Theoretic 
(OT) (Prince and Smolensky, 1993) approach instead of the parametric 
model proposed by Chomsky (UG). In OT, UG is viewed as a set of 
principles and a set of constraints, instead of parameters. The way 
language-specific grammars differ depends on the way that the constraints 
are ranked and interact. In addition, unlike parameters, constraints are 
violable.  
2.5 Monitor Theory 
2.5.1 Comprehensible Input and Chomsky’s LAD 
The Monitor Theory, often known as the Input Hypothesis, was developed 
by the linguist Stephen Krashen in the late 1970s. By the 1980s, this 
theory had become the most influential and well-known theory of L2 
acquisition. It is an overall theory of L2 acquisition that had important 
implications for language teaching. Krashen suggested that language 
acquisition is driven solely by ‘comprehensible input’ (CI), language input 
that learners can understand. Understanding spoken and written language 
input is seen as the only mechanism that results in the increase of 
underlying linguistic competence, and language output is not seen as 
having any effect on learners’ ability. Furthermore, Krashen claimed that 
linguistic competence is only advanced when language is subconsciously 
acquired, and that conscious learning cannot be used as a source of 
spontaneous language production. Finally, learning is seen to be heavily 

Theories of Second Language Acquisition 
 
57 
dependant on the learner’s mood, with learning being impaired if the 
learner is under stress or does not want to learn the language (Krashen, 
1985). Krashen’s Monitor Theory was based on Chomsky’s concept of a 
LAD (Language Acquisition Device) which is the main part of the Theory 
of Universal Grammar, as follows: only ‘comprehensible input’ to L2 
learners can activate the LAD and then L2 acquisition begins (Krashen, 
1977). Krashen posits that without comprehensible input, the second 
language learner is left with a group of words that are perceived as 
incomprehensible noise and cannot be processed in the LAD. 
2.5.2 Monitor Theory Hypotheses 
The Monitor Theory has five hypotheses: the Input Hypothesis, the 
Acquisition-Learning Hypothesis, the Monitor Hypothesis, the Natural 
Order Hypothesis and the Affective Filter Hypothesis. Each hypothesis 
and its criticism are now explained in detail. 
2.5.2.1 The Input Hypothesis 
The Input Hypothesis could be considered the most influential hypothesis 
in L2 acquisition, as it provides theoretical and practical foundations for 
the way L2 learners internalise the knowledge. It is exclusively attributed 
to acquisition, not learning. Krashen follows the innate approach by 
applying Chomsky’s Government and Binding theory and concept of 
Universal Grammar (UG) to L2 acquisition. He does so by proposing a 
Language Acquisition Device that uses L2 input to define the L2 
parameters within the constraints of UG and to increase the L2 learner’s 
proficiency. This hypothesis states that learners progress in their 
knowledge of the language when they comprehend language input that is 
slightly more advanced than their current level. Krashen called this level 
of input ‘i+l’, where ‘i’ is the language input and ‘+l’ is the next stage of 
language acquisition (Krashen, 1977). Krashen (1986, 100) states that ‘the 
acquirer understands (via hearing or reading) input language that contains 
structure ‘a bit beyond’ his or her current level of competence’. Learners 
can compensate for this gap by using context, knowledge of the world and 
extra linguistic information (Krashen, 1987). He further adds that there 
must be enough of i+l for acquisition to take place, and this will happen 
when communication takes place. When input is understood, then i+l will 
be provided automatically. Krashen hypothesises that we acquire language 
by first understanding the message and then acquiring its structures, which 
is opposite to the old view of language learning (Hatch, 1978). As 

Chapter Two 
 
58 
summarised by Cook (1993), Krashen’s (1985) evidence for the Input 
Hypothesis is as follows: 
i)   people speak to children acquiring their first language in special 
ways 
ii) 
people speak to L2 learners in special ways 
iii) L2 learners often go through an initial Silent Period 
iv) the comparative success of younger and older learners reflects 
provision of comprehensible input 
v) 
the more comprehensible input the greater the L2 proficiency 
vi) lack of comprehensible input delays language acquisition 
vii) teaching methods work according to the extent that they use 
comprehensible input  
viii) immersion teaching is successful because it provides comprehensible 
input 
ix) bilingual programs succeed to the extent they provide 
comprehensible input. 
 
The Input Hypothesis was criticised from two angles. First, the novelty of 
i+l formula is under question and defining i and l is a problematic issue 
(Brown, 2007). Second, the idea that acquisition takes place with enough 
i+l is challenged by the argument that ‘input is necessary but not sufficient 
for acquisition to take place’ (Ellis, 2003, 47). 
2.5.2.2 The Learning-Acquisition Hypothesis 
Krashen (1985) claims that the Learning-Acquisition Hypothesis is the 
most basic of his five hypotheses, and believes that we have two 
independent ways of developing competence in a second language: 
acquisition and learning. Acquisition is by using language for real 
communication and learning by knowing about language (Krashen and 
Terrell, 1983). Acquisition is a subconscious process through which the 
learner will obtain L2 competence naturally, similar to the process of a 
child who internalises his L1 implicitly. Krashen further points out that 
this kind of competence is accumulated subconsciously with no awareness. 
Therefore, it would be only a mere language ‘pick up’ (Brown, 2007). In 
addition, acquisition requires meaningful interaction in the target 
language, during which the acquirer is focused on meaning rather than on 
form (Krashen, 1977). Language learning, on the other hand, is studying 
consciously and intentionally, the features of a language, as is common in 
traditional classrooms. That is learning is a conscious knowledge 
compilation process. An explicit teaching procedure is applied here, and 

Theories of Second Language Acquisition 
 
59 
the learner should be able to extend the L2 rules to a similar context. 
Krashen (1987) calls such knowledge ‘know-about’ knowledge. This 
shows that in the acquisition process, L2 speakers do not focus on the 
correctness of their speech, but in the act of communication itself, whereas 
in the learning process, they focus on the details about the L2 language 
(like the rules of grammar or correct verb conjugation). According to Cook 
(1993), the differences between L2 acquisition and learning in Krashen’s 
Monitor Theory are as follows:  
(17)  
Acquisition 
Learning 
implicit, subconscious 
explicit, conscious 
informal situations 
formal situations 
uses grammatical ‘feel’ 
uses grammatical rules 
depends on attitude 
depends on aptitude 
stable order of acquisition 
simple to complex order of 
learning 
  
For Krashen, learning is less effective than acquisition. He also believes 
that fluency in L2 is solely the result of acquisition, not learning, and that 
L2 learners must be involved in acquiring knowledge as much as possible 
(Brown, 2007). All in all, Krashen believes that the process of acquisition 
and learning is not bidirectional in the sense that learning may never lead 
to acquisition and vice versa. 
The sharp distinction between learning and acquisition based on the 
definition of consciousness was, however, met with strong criticisms. 
McLaughlin (1990), for instance, refutes such distinction based on the fact 
that psychologists still have difficulty giving an exhaustive definition for 
the notion of consciousness. Hence, he finds that it would be implausible 
to extend this fuzzy distinction to the process of language acquisition and 
to make strong claims based on it (Brown, 2007). Gregg (1984) also 
rejects the most fundamental of Krashen’s hypotheses, the acquisition-
learning dichotomy. Gregg concludes that under normal conditions the 
Monitor cannot be used and since it is the only way in which learning can 
be utilised, there is no need to talk about two different ways of gaining 
competence in a second language. Finally, some research (e.g. Norris and 
Ortega, 2000) shows that contrary to this hypothesis, form focused 
instruction can help learners improve their communicative competence 
according to their styles and strategies, since learned knowledge may lead 
to improvements in the process of acquisition. 

Chapter Two 
 
60 
2.5.2.3 The Monitor Hypothesis 
The Monitor Hypothesis is used by Krashen to explain the relationship 
between acquisition and learning and it pertains to the operational 
application of learned knowledge. It shows how learned knowledge may 
be useful to achieve fluency. This hypothesis asserts that a learner’s 
system acts as a monitor or editor to what they are producing. In other 
words, while only the acquired system is able to produce spontaneous 
speech, the learned system is used to check what is spoken. Krashen and 
Terrell (1983) suggests that conscious learning can only be used as a 
Monitor or an editor. Before the learner produces an utterance, he or she 
internally scans it for errors, and uses the learned system to make 
corrections. Self-correction occurs when the learner uses the Monitor to 
correct a sentence after it is uttered. The Monitor Hypothesis then predicts 
faster initial progress by adults than children, as adults use this monitor 
when producing L2 utterances before having acquired the ability for 
natural performances, and adult learners will input more into conversations 
earlier than children. 
According to Krashen, for the Monitor to be successfully used, three 
conditions must be met: the learner must (a) know the rule, (b) be focused 
on correctness (form) and (c) have time to use the monitor. In addition, the 
simplicity of learned knowledge is of paramount importance. As long as 
the learned rules are easy to apply and not too complex, monitoring seems 
to be more efficient. Krashen also divides monitor users into three types: 
over-users, optimal users and under-users. Over-users are all the time 
obsessed with the grammaticality of their speech, and therefore over-use 
the monitor at the expense of their fluency. Optimal users use monitoring 
whenever it does not interfere in the process of communication. Finally, 
under-users are those who do not use their conscious knowledge, because 
they do not have a good command of it or prefer not to use it. 
Krashen’s Monitor Hypothesis has been criticised as well, since there are 
many difficulties with the use of the monitor, making it rather weak as a 
language tool. First, the condition of ‘knowing the rule’ is difficult to 
meet, because even the best students do not learn every rule that is taught 
and not every rule of a language is always included in a text or taught by 
the teacher. Second, there is a price that is paid for ‘having time to use the 
monitor’: the speaker is then focused on form rather than meaning, 
resulting in the production and exchange of less information, thus slowing 
the flow of conversation, especially by the over-users of the monitor. 
Third, the rules of language make up only a small portion of our language 

Theories of Second Language Acquisition 
 
61 
competence: acquisition does not provide 100% language competence. 
Due to these difficulties, Krashen recommends using the monitor at times 
when it does not interfere with communication, such as while writing. 
Another major criticism is that Krashen relegates language monitoring to a 
peripheral position in language acquisition. It is seen as simply being a 
post-learning process, a tool for use of language in certain conditions. 
However, researchers such as Rubin (1975) have pointed to monitoring as 
a basic learning strategy. Ellis (2003) considers monitoring as one of five 
major aspects of successful language learning. 
2.5.2.4 The Natural Order Hypothesis 
Krashen (1977, 1981) believes that L2 acquisition follows a natural order 
in the sense that every L2 learner will acquire the rules of that language in 
a predictable order. This means that we can predict the sequence (e.g. 
morphemes) of acquisition. For example, students learning English, 
regardless of their cultural and linguistic background, will acquire the 
plural ‘s’ (boys) before the third person singular ‘s’ (eats). Despite the 
time a teacher spends practising the grammatical aspect of third person 
singular ‘s’ with the students, the students will not use this grammatical 
aspect in L2 conversations until they have naturally acquired it. That is the 
natural order of acquisition is not affected by instructional sequences and 
is not dependent on the ease with which a particular language feature can 
be taught. This hypothesis was based on the morpheme studies by Dulay 
and Burt, which found that certain morphemes were predictably learned 
before others during the course of L2 acquisition. Based on different 
studies conducted on L1 acquisition (e.g. Brown, 1973; de Villers and de 
Villers, 1973), Krashen concludes that there must be a natural order in 
acquiring an L2, and studies on L2 acquisition support the predictability of 
such an order. Despite some differences between L1 and L2 acquisition, 
L2 learners have shown striking similarities in this regard and were almost 
consistent in the order of acquisition (Dulay and Burt, 1974; Kesseler and 
Idar, 1977, as cited in Krashen, 1977). 
 The Natural Order Hypothesis also received some criticism. For example, 
Gregg (1984) argues that generalising the results of a study on the 
acquisition of a limited set of English morphemes to L2 acquisition as a 
whole is fallible. Morpheme studies offer no indications that L2 learners 
similarly acquire other linguistic features (phonology, syntax, semantics 
and pragmatics) in any predictable sequence, let alone in any sequence at 
all (Gregg, 1984). In addition, this hypothesis fails to account for the 
considerable influence of L1 on L2 acquisition. In fact the results of other 

Chapter Two 
 
62 
studies (e.g. Zafar, 2009) indicate that L2 learners acquire an L2 in 
different orders, depending on their native languages. Therefore, despite 
what this hypothesis claims, L2 learners do not necessarily acquire 
grammatical structures in a predictable order. 
2.5.2.5 The Affective Filter Hypothesis 
Krashen (1987) hypothesises that the ‘affective filter’ is one of the most 
important barriers towards L2 acquisition. The affective filter is an 
impediment to learning or acquisition caused by negative emotional 
(affective) responses to one’s environment. This filter impedes the process 
of absorbing L2 input and transforming it into intake. When learners come 
into direct contact with L2, this is referred to as ‘input’ and when they 
process that L2 in a way that can contribute to learning, this is referred to 
as ‘intake’. Krashen (1985, 100) states that ‘a mental block, caused by 
affective factors ... that prevents input from reaching the language 
acquisition device’. Krashen claims that all people possess a ‘filter’ which 
moves into one of two positions: low or high. A low position allows 
language to enter the person’s LAD and be acquired, whereas a high 
position prohibits language from entering the LAD thereby restricting 
acquisition. A low affective filter exists where the L2 learner feels 
comfortable and non-threatened in the learning environment and a high 
affective filter exists when the L2 learner is too pressured by outside 
factors to relax and allow the acquisition process to occur. Therefore, to 
ensure L2 acquisition, it is important that the L2 teacher maintains a 
relaxed and enjoyable learning environment. Krashen also claims that 
there are three factors that affect the filter: self confidence, anxiety and 
motivation. First, a good amount of self confidence will lower the 
affective filter in order to let the input in. Second, the more anxious the L2 
learner is, the higher the amount of resistance against absorption of input 
(the higher the filter) and hence obstructing the process of L2 acquisition. 
Third, the more motivated the L2 learner is, the better the L2 acquisition 
will be. According to Krashen (1982), there are two prime issues that 
prevent the lowering of the affective filter. The first is not allowing for a 
silent period (expecting the student to speak before they have received an 
adequate amount of comprehensible input according to their individual 
needs). The second is correcting their errors too early-on in the process. 
 Like Krashen’s other four hypotheses, the Affective Filter Hypothesis was 
also criticised. This criticism questioned the claim of this hypothesis that 
affective factors alone account for individual variation in L2 acquisition. 
Krashen claims that children lack the affective filter that causes most adult 

Theories of Second Language Acquisition 
 
63 
L2 learners to never completely master their L2 (Zafar, 2009). Such claim 
fails to withstand scrutiny because children also experience differences in 
non-linguistic variables such as motivation, self-confidence and anxiety 
that supposedly account for child-adult differences in L2 learning. In 
addition, there are many cases in which adults acquired a native-like 
proficiency (Brown, 2007). 
The whole Monitor Theory (the Input Hypothesis Model) and its five 
hypotheses are presented in the following diagram.

from Krashen, 1982, pp. 16 and 32; and Greg, 1984) 
 
2.5.3 Criticism of Monitor Theory 
Krashen’s Monitor Theory, like other L2 acquisition theories, had some 
proponents and opponents. Some advocates consider it as a macro theory 
attempting to cover most of the factors involved in L2 acquisition such as 
age, personality traits, classroom instruction, innate mechanisms of 
language acquisition, environmental influences and input. For example, 
Lightbown (1984, 246) considers Monitor Theory as a combination of ‘a 
linguistic theory (through its ‘natural order’ hypothesis), social psychological 
theory (through its ‘affective filter’ hypothesis), psychological learning theory 
(through its acquisition-learning hypothesis), discourse analysis and 
sociolinguistic theory (through both the comprehensive input hypothesis 
and the ‘monitor’ hypothesis)’. 
Ellis (1990, 57) also praises ‘the lucidity, simplicity and explanatory 
power of Krashen’s theory’. On the other hand, McLaughlin (1987) 
acknowledges Krashen’s attempt to develop an extensive and detailed 
theory of L2 acquisition but finds it inadequate in that some of its central 
assumptions and hypotheses are not clearly defined and thus are not 

Chapter Two 
 
64 
readily testable. McLaughlin (1987, 56) states that ‘Krashen’s theory fails 
at every juncture ... Krashen has not defined his terms with enough 
precision, the empirical basis of the theory is weak, and the theory is not 
clear in its predictions’. In addition, Gregg (1984, 94) points out that ‘each 
of Krashen’s hypotheses is marked by serious flaws: undefinable or ill 
defined terms, unmotivated constructs, lack of empirical content and thus 
of falsifiability, lack of explanatory power’. Finally, Monitor Theory was 
also criticised by the advocates of Universal Grammar (Nativist Theory) 
and by psychologists focusing on skills acquisition. Despite the various 
criticisms, Krashen’s Monitor Theory of L2 acquisition had a great impact 
on the way L2 learning was viewed and initiated research towards the 
discovery of orders of acquisition. Therefore, this theory will be used to 
explain the difficulties faced by the Arabic speakers of L2 English 
regarding English segmental and main word stress. 
‡6 The Ontogeny Phylogeny Model (OPM) 
2.6.1 L2 Learner’s Interlanguage 
Major’s (2001) Ontogeny Phylogeny Model (OPM) is a framework that 
incorporates key concepts from SLA in order to explain and make 
predictions about L2 acquisition processes that make up an L2 learner’s 
interlanguage (IL). Major applied the biological terms ‘ontogeny’, the 
evolution of individual organisms and ‘phylogeny’, the evolution of 
species, to language, stating that ‘ontogenetically, the OPM deals with the 
development of an individual’s IL; phylogenetically the OPM deals with 
larger populations, including language contact and change’ (Major, 2001, 
81). In OPM, Major (2001) tries to answer the question of why L2 learners 
may master the grammar and vocabulary of the new languages, but almost 
never achieve a native phonology. Major (2008, 74) states that ‘in this 
model [OPM] interlanguage is composed of elements of L1 [transfer], L2 
[acquired], and universals [including UG]’. In OPM, target-like performance 
is described as influence from the L2 (i.e. successful L2 acquisition) and, 
conversely, non-target like performance can be a result of either L1 
transfer or from language universals (U) including markedness.  
2.6.2 Transfer and L2 Phonology Acquisition 
Major’s (2001) OPM model is a revision of his earlier Ontogeny Model 
(OM) (Major, 1987). Both OPM and OM consider transfer as a major 
factor in L2 phonology acquisition. Zampini (2008, 3) points out that ‘the 

Theories of Second Language Acquisition 
 
65 
OM posits that transfer is initially the major influence in L2 phonology, 
but that this effect decreases over time as developmental processes 
increases’. In the OPM, transfer is still viewed as a dominant effect in the 
initial stages of acquisition; however, the effects of transfer are greater on 
unmarked L2 features than those that are marked. As in the OM, transfer 
effects decrease across time as markedness constraints increase and then 
decrease as the L2 is acquired (Major, 2001; Zampini, 2008). Major (2001, 
85-86) gives the following summary explanation for the interaction of L1, 
L2 and language universals (U) in an L2 learner’s interlanguage (IL): 
(18) At the beginning stages the L1 influence is so strong that it prevents 
U[niversals] from exerting its influence. Later the learner realises 
(often unconsciously) that the L1 is not a sufficient substitute for the 
L2. As a result of this, as well as continued L2 exposure, L2 
components start to develop. However, because much of the L2 may be 
beyond the learner’s reach or is nebulous in the learner’s mind, 
simultaneously U starts to exert its influence, which results in 
phenomena that are neither part of the L1 nor L2. Thus, at an early 
stage L1 obliterates the effect of U so nothing in U is evident that is not 
already in the L1; that is, U remains dormant. However, at a later stage 
U awakens and has a life of its own, so to speak. Then in later stages, 
the influence of U decreases as the L2 becomes more developed. The 
decreasing influence of U means that after a U principle has operated 
and has been ‘correctly’ instantiated in the IL (i.e. it is nativelike) U 
has ‘done its work’ so to speak and therefore does not appear as a 
nonnative part of the IL – but rather as part of the L2 component of the 
IL.’ 
2.6.3 Three Stages of L2 Acquisition 
The OPM, then, states that (a) L2 learners go through three stages of L2 
acquisition: initial state, development state and end state, (b) initially L2 
learners start out with the phonological system of their L1 (i.e. initial 
stages of L2 learning are characterised by L1 transfer), (c) as learners gain 
more experience with the L2, target-like forms become more frequent and 
L1 transfer decreases, and (d) simultaneously, the influence of language 
universals increases and then in later stages decreases, so that in an 
idealised end-state, learners’ interlanguage is equivalent to the phonological 
system of a native speaker. Major (2001, 117) does not claim that all L2 
learners will reach the end-state and points out that ‘a poor learner will ... 
often fossilize at an early stage of development’. Therefore, the OPM 
simply claims that as a language develops (e.g. phonology in a learner’s 
IL), the influence of L1 decreases, L2 increases and U increases and then 

Chapter Two 
 
66 
decreases. Major’s (2001) proposal for the components of the learner’s 
interlanguage is as follows: 
(19) The L2 learner’s Interlanguage (Major, 2001): 
IL = parts of L1 + parts of L2 + parts of U = 100% 
2.6.4 Four Corollaries 
Major’s (2001) OPM makes a general claim concerning the interrelationship 
between the L1, the L2 and language universals U with respect to four 
domains or corollaries: chronology, similarity, markedness and style. 
(20) A – CHRONOLOGY 
IL develops chronologically in the following manner: (a) L2 increases, (b) 
L1 decreases, and (c) U increases and then decreases.  
B – SIMILARITY 
In similar phenomena, IL develops chronologically in the following 
manner: (a) L2 increases slowly, (b) L1 decreases slowly, and (c) U 
increases slowly and then decreases slowly. Thus, the role of L1 is much 
greater than U for similar phenomena than for less similar ones. 
C – STYLE  
As style becomes more formal, (a) L2 increases, (b) L1 decreases, and (c) 
U increases and then decreases. 
D – MARKEDNESS 
In marked phenomena, IL develops chronologically in the following 
manner: (a) L2 increases slowly, (b) L1 decreases and then decreases 
slowly, and (c) U increases rapidly and then decreases slowly. Thus, the 
role of U is much greater than L1 for marked phenomena than for less 
marked ones. 
2.6.4.1 Chronology 
In the first case, the CHRONOLOGICAL corollary predicts that over time, 
the amount of influence of the L1 in a learner’s pronunciation will 
decrease, the influence of the L2 will increase, and the influence of U in 
the IL will first increase and then decrease. In other words, at the starting 
point of L2 acquisition, learners rely 100% on phonological transfer from 
the L1 but, as L2 development occurs, the influence of the L1 decreases. 
At the same time, through exposure to the L2 sound system and 

Theories of Second Language Acquisition 
 
67 
acquisition of L2 segments, influence from the L2 becomes stronger. 
Finally, U increases in the early stages of acquisition as learners realise the 
inadequacy of negative L1 transfer but cannot produce L2 segments in a 
target-like manner. U later decreases as learners begin to acquire target-
like L2 pronunciation (Major, 2001; Zampini, 2008). 
2.6.4.2 Similarity 
The OPM corollaries concerning similarity and markedness also describe 
development over time as a function of varying amounts of L1, L2 and U. 
With regard to SIMILARITY, the OPM bases its claim on a large body of 
research that suggests that similar sounds in the L1 and L2 are more 
difficult to learn than dissimilar sounds (Major, 1987; Flege, 1992, 1995; 
Best, 1994; Kuhl. 2000). Major and Kim (1996) argue that new sounds are 
not more difficult to acquire, but rather are acquired at a slower rate. This 
premise serves as the basis for the OPM corollary on similarity which 
predicts that for similar sounds, L1 transfer will be initially high and 
decrease only slowly, while acquisition of the accurate L2 sound increases 
slowly. In the acquisition of dissimilar sounds, on the other hand, progress 
will be more rapid and language universals will have a much greater 
influence on IL (Major, 2001, 2008). 
2.6.4.3 Markedness 
The third corollary of the OPM concerns MARKEDNESS, a factor that 
also appears to impact L2 phonological acquisition (Eckman, 1977, 1981, 
1991; Castino, 1992; Major and Faudree, 1996; Diaz-Campos, 2004). The 
concept of markedness relies on implicational hierarchies (strict version) 
or statistical frequencies (less-strict version) as a means to predict the 
relative difficulty of a segment. In the strict definition, sounds that are 
more marked are those whose existence in a language also necessarily 
implies the presence of other, less-marked sounds. In the less-strict 
definition, more marked sounds are those that occur infrequently in the 
world’s languages. In Major’s OPM, the more marked a sound, the slower 
the rate of learning. Markedness and similarity can interact, in which case, 
the OPM predicts that more similar and more marked sounds be acquired 
more slowly than less similar and less marked sounds (Major and Kim 
1999; Major 2001; Zampini, 2008). 

Chapter Two 
 
68 
2.6.4.4 Style 
STYLE VARIATION constitutes the final corollary of the OPM, which 
predicts that as style becomes more formal, L1 influence decreases, L2 
increases, and U increases and then decreases (Major, 2001). This domain 
of Major’s model stems from research in sociolinguistics and SLA which 
suggests that in a more formal style of speaking (e.g. pronouncing a word 
list), L2 learners are more conscious of form and monitor more closely 
their pronunciation, resulting in more accurate production and less L1 
transfer. In more informal styles (e.g. spontaneous conversation), learners 
tend to pay more attention to meaning and less attention to form and, 
consequently, target-like accuracy in the L2 tends to decrease, with a 
corresponding increase in L1 transfer (Beebe, 1980; Schmidt, 1992; Diaz-
Campos, 2006). Wode’s (1981) findings with his daughter’s use of 
English and German lend further support to Major’s model. He found that 
his daughter would produce more transfers from her L1 German to her L2 
English in informal/spontaneous speech than in more formal contexts. 
Labov (1994) also found this to be the case in his research as he observed 
that as speakers moved from more informal speech to more formal speech 
their accuracy increased. 
By bringing the concepts of similarity, markedness and style variation 
together into one model, the OPM offers a comprehensive framework for 
analysing L2 phonological acquisition over time in interlanguage.  
2.6.5 OPM’s L2 Production Scenarios 
The OPM states that L2 learners can be faced with two main scenarios 
depending on whether new or similar linguistic phenomena are involved, 
and it is predicted that L2 development will be different in each of them. It 
is also argued that new phenomena can be either normal or marked (i.e. 
relatively rare) (Major, 2002). Major (2001, 156) points out that ‘the 
relative proportions of U and L1 depend on whether phenomena are 
normal, similar, or marked’. Both similar and new phenomena that are 
marked are predicted to be acquired with difficulty. Thus, during the stage 
at which L2 normal new phenomena will be acquired, the L1 will still be 
present in similar phenomena, and U will still be present in new marked 
phenomena, as shown in Table 2, which includes OPM’s L2 production 
scenarios.

Major argues that Hancin-Bhatt and Bhatt (1997, 386) provide empirical 
evidence and theoretical support for the OPM because their Optimality-
Theoretic account of the data shows that L2 learners start with mostly 
transfer-related errors. Later on, they show developmental errors and when 
they become more advanced they have neither of the previous two types of 
errors and have a more native-like performance. The OPM is ‘purposely 
not presented in terms of any formal linguistic framework thus supposedly 
enabling it to survive any possible outdating or refutation of current 
theories’ (Major 2002, 88). Major (2002) states that his model makes very 
general claims which do not necessitate any details concerning specific 
phenomena such as fine-grained phonetics. He argues that this is a virtue 
rather than a weakness because the OPM provides a macroscopic 
framework for testing individual phenomena.

2.6.6 Criticism of OPM 
While Major’s (2001) OPM is a straightforward testable theory that 
attempts to combine the various linguistic factors that have been suggested 
as giving rise to foreign accents, concerns have been raised with respect to 
its ontological status and the fact that Major fails to provide clear-cut 
definitions of L1, L2 and U (Picard, 2002). It is, for instance, not clear at 
what level the various factors operate and what it means for a phone to be 
acquired. 
2.7 Summary of L2 Acquisition Theories 
This section presents a summary of the above six theories of L2 acquisition 
and their way of analysing L2 learners’ interlanguage. These theories are 
Contrastive Analysis Hypothesis (CAH), Error Analysis (EA), Markedness 
Theory, Universal Grammar (UG), Monitor Theory and the Ontogeny 
Phylogeny Model (OPM). This summary is presented in Table 2.

CAH explains L2 learners’ acquisitional difficulties on the 
basis of the differences and similarities between L1 and L2. 
Different L1 and L2 features are difficult to acquire, whereas 
similar features are easy to acquire. L2 learners’ errors are due 
to L1 negative transfer.   
 
The Strong CAH: A systematic CA could predict L2 
learners’ difficulties (i.e. interlingual errors) and remedial 
teaching materials could be devised. 
 
The Weak CAH: A comparison between L1 and L2 might 
help explain the difficulties evident from the L2 learners’ 
errors.            
- CA predicts limited errors  
  and interlingual errors only. 
 
- Some similar L1 and L2  
  features were difficult to  
  acquire, whereas some  
  different features were easy  
  to acquire.  
 
- L1 interference is not the  
  only cause of L2 learners’  
  errors.  
Error Analysis 
(EA):  
 
 
Interlingual and 
Intralingual Errors 
Corder  
(1967) 
EA explains L2 learners’ errors by comparing the learner’s 
interlanguage with the L2 norm. It explains both interlingual 
(L1 negative transfer) and intralingual errors. Intralingual errors 
are not related to L1 negative transfer and are due to other 
factors such as faulty teaching techniques or materials, 
overgeneralization of L2 rules and age of L2 acquisition.       
- EA misses the L2 learner’s  
  correct form by counting  
  incorrect forms only. 
 
- EA also misses ‘avoidance’:  
  L2 learners may find ways  
  to avoid producing L2  
  difficult structures.

Markedness Theory is the CAH plus typological markedness. 
It explains both the L2 learners’ difficulties (CAH) and the 
degree (levels) of these difficulties (markedness).    
 
MDH states that L2 structures that are both different and more 
marked than corresponding L1 structures will cause learning 
difficulty. Unmarked structures are acquired before and easier 
to acquire than marked structures.  
 
SCH states that interlanguage and primary languages obey the 
same set of universal generalizations. 
- Some L2 errors did not occur in     
   an area of difference between  
   L1 and L2.  
 
- The MDH did not explain  
  why L2 learners altered the  
  marked structures in the way 
  they did.  
 
- Markedness is a fact to be  
  explained (Archibald, 1998).

Chomsky 
(1981) 
UG explains L2 acquisition on the basis of L1 acquisition. UG 
consists of a set of principles (i.e. universal rules) and a set of 
parameters (language-specific variables). UG suggests that human 
minds have a Language Acquisition Devise (LAD) that helps the 
learner in the process of acquisition. In UG, L2 acquisition is a 
matter of setting the correct L2 parameters.  
 
There are four positions regarding L2 access to UG: direct 
access as L1 learners, indirect access via L1, no-access and 
partial (dual) access.              
- Its empirical evidence has  
  been restricted to the  
  acquisition of a small set of  
  syntactic phenomena  
  (McLaughlin, 1987).

  psychological processes  
  involved in learning a  
  language.

This theory is based on Chomsky’s (1981) concept of a LAD, 
as follows: only ‘comprehensible input’ to L2 learners can 
activate the LAD and then L2 acquisition begins. This theory 
has five hypotheses. The Input Hypothesis states that learners 
progress in their language knowledge, when they comprehend 
language input that is slightly more advanced than their 
current level. The Acquisition-Learning Hypothesis states that 
we have two independent ways of developing L2 competence: 
acquisition and learning. Acquisition is an implicit and 
subconscious process, whereas learning is an explicit and 
conscious process. The Monitor Hypothesis states that a 
learner’s system acts as a monitor or editor to what they are 
producing. The Natural Order Hypothesis states that L2 
acquisition follows a natural, predictable order. Finally, the 
Affective Filter Hypothesis states that L2 learner has an 
affective filter that impedes L2 acquisition depending on 
negative, emotional (affective) responses to learner’s 
environment.                  
- Its central assumptions and  
  hypotheses are not clearly  
  defined and thus are not  
  readily testable   
  (McLaughlin, 1987).   
 
- Each hypothesis is marked 
  by serious flaws, and thus  
  the theory lacks falsifiability 
  and explanatory power  
  (Gregg, 1994).

Major 
(2001) 
OPM has four corollaries: chronology, similarity, markedness 
and style, which are explained in the light of three L2 learning 
stages: initial state, development state and end state. Early 
stages of L2 speech learning are characterised by transfer, but 
as transfer decreases, the relative importance of universals 
increases and eventually decreases, as accurate L2 forms 
emerge. In addition, the relative importance of transfer is 
greater in similar phenomena than in dissimilar ones, whereas 
the relative importance of universals is greater in marked 
phenomena than in unmarked ones.            
- Concerns have been raised 
with respect to its ontological 
status (James, 2003).  
 
- It fails to provide clear-cut 
definitions of L1, L2 and U. 
For example, not clear at what 
level various factors operate 
and what it means for a phone 
to be acquired (Picard, 2002).

Of the six L2 theories of L2 acquisition discussed above, the following 
three theories will be used to analyse the subjects’ stress errors in chapter 
4: Results and Analysis: Contrastive Analysis (CA), Error Analysis (EA) 
and Markedness Theory. This is because these three theories are very 
relevant to the type of this research data. 
2.8 Predictions 
In the light of the three theories of L2 acquisition, predictions are made 
with respect to the current study. These predictions will be tested in the 
general discussion section in chapter 4: Results and Analysis, to find out 
whether or not they are confirmed and if the findings provide any evidence 
for any of the three L2 theories.  
Prediction 1: Contrastive Analysis (CA):  
L2 English sounds and main word stress patterns that are different 
from corresponding L1 Arabic ones will cause learning difficulties for 
the Arabic speakers of L2 English, whereas the similar sounds and 
stress patterns will not. These difficulties are due to L1 negative 
transfer.  
Prediction 2: Error Analysis (EA):  
The sounds and main word stress errors made by the Arabic speakers 
of L2 English are due to interlingual (i.e. due to L1 negative transfer) 
and intralingual factors (i.e. due to other factors such as overgeneralisation 
of L2 rules, hypercorrection, simplification, false concepts, fossilisation, 
amount of exposure/use and individual differences).  
Prediction 3: Markedness Theory:  
The Markedness Differential Hypothesis (MDH):  
L2 English sounds and main word stress patterns that are both different 
and more marked than corresponding L1 ones will cause learning 
difficulties for the Arabic speakers of L2 English.  
The Structural Conformity Hypothesis (SCH):  
The interlanguage of the Arabic speakers of L2 English obeys the same 
set of universal generalisations.  

Theories of Second Language Acquisition

2.9 Chapter Summary 
This chapter explains six theories of second language acquisition which 
are related to this study. These theories are Contrastive Analysis (CA) 
(Fries, 1945), Error Analysis (EA) (Corder, 1967), Markedness Theory 
(Eckman, 1977), Universal Grammar (UG) (Chomsky, 1981), Monitor 
Theory (Krashen, 1985) and the Ontogeny Phylogeny Model (OPM) 
(Major (2001). CA explains L2 learners’ acquisitional difficulties on the 
basis of the differences and similarities between L1 and L2. Different L1 
and L2 features are difficult to acquire, whereas similar features are easy 
to acquire. L2 learners’ errors are due to L1 negative transfer. EA explains 
L2 learners’ errors by comparing the learner’s interlanguage with the L2 
norm. It explains both interlingual (L1 negative transfer) and intralingual 
errors. Intralingual errors are not related to L1 negative transfer and are 
due to other factors such as faulty teaching techniques or materials, 
overgeneralization of L2 rules and age of L2 acquisition. Markedness 
Theory is the CA plus typological markedness. It explains both the L2 
learners’ difficulties (CA) and the degree (levels) of these difficulties 
(markedness). Markedness Differential Hypothesis (MDH) states that L2 
structures that are both different and more marked than corresponding L1 
structures will cause learning difficulty. Unmarked structures are acquired 
before and easier to acquire than marked structures. Universal Grammar 
(UG) explains L2 acquisition on the basis of L1 acquisition. UG consists 
of a set of principles (i.e. universal rules) and a set of parameters 
(language-specific variables). UG suggests that human minds have a 
Language Acquisition Device (LAD) that helps the learner in the process 
of acquisition. In UG, L2 acquisition is a matter of setting the correct L2 
parameters. There are four positions regarding L2 access to UG: direct 
access as L1 learners, indirect access via L1, no-access and partial (dual) 
access. The Monitor Theory is based on Chomsky’s (1981) concept of a 
LAD, as follows: only ‘comprehensible input’ to L2 learners can activate 
the LAD and then L2 acquisition begins. This theory has five hypotheses. 
The Input Hypothesis states that learners progress in their language 
knowledge, when they comprehend language input that is slightly more 
advanced than their current level. The Acquisition-Learning Hypothesis 
states that we have two independent ways of developing L2 competence: 
acquisition and learning. Acquisition is an implicit and subconscious 
process, whereas learning is an explicit and conscious process. The 
Monitor Hypothesis states that a learner’s system acts as a monitor or 
editor to what they are producing. The Natural Order Hypothesis states 
that L2 acquisition follows a natural, predictable order. Finally, the 

Chapter Two 
 
76 
Affective Filter Hypothesis states that L2 learner has an affective filter that 
impedes L2 acquisition depending on negative, emotional (affective) 
responses to learner’s environment. Finally, the Ontogeny Phylogeny 
Model (OPM) has four corollaries: chronology, similarity, markedness and 
style, which are explained in the light of three L2 learning stages: initial 
state, development state and end state. Early stages of L2 speech learning 
are characterised by transfer, but as transfer decreases, the relative 
importance of universals increases and eventually decreases, as accurate 
L2 forms emerge. In addition, the relative importance of transfer is greater 
in similar phenomena than in dissimilar ones, whereas the relative 
importance of universals is greater in marked phenomena than in 
unmarked ones. The first three theories and the predictions based on them 
will be used in Chapter 4: Results and Analysis to analyse Arabic 
speakers’ English segmental and main word stress errors and the reasons 
behind them. 
The next chapter explains English and Arabic sound systems (consonants, 
consonant clusters and vowels), syllable structures and main word stress 
rules. It also compares them and explains their implications for L2 English 
sound production and stress acquisition.

ENGLISH AND ARABIC SOUNDS  
AND WORD STRESS  
 
 
 
3.0 Introduction 
Arabic is a Semitic language, whereas English is an Indo-European 
language. Therefore, Arabic grammar, sound system, syllable structure 
and word stress rules are very different from English ones and there is a 
large potential for errors of interference when Arab learners produce 
spoken or written English. Smith (1987, 142) states that ‘the differences 
from country to country are more marked than, say, differences between 
UK, US and Australian English. Because the Arabic writing system is also 
totally different from that of Indo-European languages, Arabic speakers 
have far greater difficulties in learning English than most Europeans’. 
This chapter explains English and Arabic sound systems (consonants, 
consonant clusters and vowels), syllable structures and main word stress 
rules. It also compares them and explains their implications for L2 English 
sound production and stress acquisition.

3.2 Consonant Clusters 
3.2.1 Arabic Consonant Clusters 
Initial Clusters:  
 
Initially, Arabic permits only single consonants: 
 
/C/ /kalima/ ‘word’ 
         /kita:b/ ‘book’ 
 
Medial clusters:  
 
Medially, Arabic permits both single and compound consonants: 
 
/C/ /ka:tib/  ‘writer’ 
/CC/ /madrasa/ ‘school’ 
 
Final Clusters:  
 
Finally, Arabic permits both single and compound consonants: 
 
/C/ /kar:m/ ‘generous’ 
/CC/ /fahm/ ‘understanding’ 
 

Chapter Three 
 
82 
Connected Speech:  
 
• Arabic permits only two consonants in close transition: 
 
/CC//katabat kitab/‘she wrote a book’ 
 
• In Arabic, to avoid a sequence of more than two consonants, a short 
epenthetic vowel occurs between the second and third consonants: 
 
/CC-i-C/ /baݴdi ma na:m/ ‘after he has slept’ 
              /fi'himti dars/‘I understood a lesson’  
              /'binti ?uxti/ ‘my sister’s daughter’  
3.2.2 English Consonant Clusters 
Initial Clusters:  
In English, a word may have an initial consonant cluster of two or three 
consonants as follows: 
/CC/ plane, sleep, pray, great, spare, dream  
 
 
/CCC/string, spring, scream, street, splash  
Medial and Final Clusters:  
English permits a medial and final consonant cluster of two, three or four 
consonants as follows: 
 MEDIAL FINAL 
/CC/   seldom grasp  chapter  lamp  
/CCC/ transport camps  landmark  hands  
/CCCC/  landscape  tempts  transplant  prompts 
 
Connected Speech:  
English permits up to six or seven consonants in connected speech as 
follows: 
/CC-C/ 
 best man 
/CC-CC/ 
 strange dream 
/CC-CCC/ 
 bent screw 
/CCC-CCC/  next spring 
/CCCC-CCC/  She tempts strangers.

3.3 Vowels 
3.3.1 Arabic Vowels 
Arabic has three short vowels and five long vowels: 
Short Vowels:  
/i/ as in /min/ ‘from’ 
/a/ as in /qalam/ ‘pencil’ 
/u/ as in /kun/ ‘be’ (imp.) 
 
Long vowels: 
 
/i:/ as in /fi:l/ ‘element’ 
/e:/ as in /ze:t/ ‘oil’ 
/o:/ as in /fo:z/ ‘victory’ 
/a:/ as in /ba:b/ ‘door’ 
/u:/ as in /ƫu:t/ ‘whale’ 
3.3.2 English Vowels 
English has 12 pure vowels (monophthongs: 7 short vowels and 5 long 
vowels) and 8 diphthongs. A pure vowel is a vowel which remains 
constant and does not glide such as /e/, whereas a diphthong is a sound 
which consists of a glide from one vowel to another such as /aܼ/. These 
vowels can be shown as follows: 
Short Vowels: 
/ܼ/ as in ‘ship  
/ܥ/ as in ‘hot’ 
/e/ as in ‘ten’  
/ݜ/ as in ‘book’ 
/æ/ as in ‘hat’  
/ۑ/ as in ‘about’ 
/ݞ/ as in ‘cut’ 
 
Long Vowels: 
/i:/ as in ‘sheep’ 
/୆:/ as in ‘horse’ 
/u:/ as in ‘food’

3.4 Syllable Structure 
3.4.1 Arabic Syllable Structure 
The exact structure of the syllable varies considerably from one language 
to another. MSA has many restrictions on syllable structures (Watson, 
2002). For example, MSA syllables must start with one and only one 
consonant (Broselow, 1988) and the syllabic structure prevents three 
consonants or two vowels to appear adjacently. The MSA syllable 
structure constituents and their restrictions are now discussed. 
3.4.1.1 Onset 
In MSA, onsets are obligatory in the sense that no syllable can begin with 
a vowel. Thus MSA does not allow onset-less syllables, Broselow (1984, 
256) states that in MSA ‘each syllable must begin with one and only one 
consonant’. MSA also follows the Maximal Onset Principle, stated by 
Broselow (1976, 34) as follows: ‘a single consonant followed by a vowel 
always shares syllable with that vowel’, as shown below (NB. IPA 
transcriptions are used throughout).  
(1) a. /muf.ta:ʄ/  
‘key’ 
  b. /mak.ta.ba/ 
‘library’ 
  c. /siݶ.ݶa:.da/ 
‘carpet’ 
  d. /fi.himt/  
‘I understood’ 
  e. /ka.ra:.si/  
‘chairs’ 
 
In addition, MSA has a constraint on the syllabic structure which outlaws 
complex onsets (Broselow, 1992), as in /buxala/ misers and /maktab/ 
office. The syllable structure of these words is shown below: 

English and Arabic Sounds and Word Stress  
 
85 
 
As a consequence, we cannot have words like blue, true, black, strange 
and spring in MSA. 
 Itô (1989, 223) proposes the Onset Principle, which requires onsetless 
syllables to be avoided: 
(3) Onset Principle: 
  Avoid ı [V 
 
Since in all Arabic dialects, including MSA, onsets are obligatory, this 
principle can be changed to: 
(4) Onset Principle: 
 
Impossible ı [V 
 
In MSA only the forms in a) are acceptable syllabifications, but not the 
ones in b) or c):

Onsetless syllables and complex onsets are banned absolutely in MSA.

3.4.1.2 Nucleus 
As in all languages, MSA syllables must have a nucleus which can be as 
follows: 
 - simple: it includes only one vowel as in /ma.li.ka/ queen and  
 /mux.ta.li.fa/ different (f. sing.) 
 - complex: it includes a long vowel as in /mi:n/ who and ƫXW whale. 
There are some restrictions on the MSA nucleus. First, this nucleus cannot 
be a consonant, such as the syllabic consonants in English. Second, a VV 
nucleus is not allowed in MSA, where VV is a diphthong, and V: is a long 
vowel. 
MSA Nucleus Parameters: 
- V nucleus allowed ? (yes) 
- VV nucleus allowed?(no) (but V: allowed) 
- C nucleus allowed?(no) 
MSA Nucleus Template: 
N [V] N [V:] hence *N [VV] 
3.4.1.3 Coda 
MSA coda can have one of the following forms: 
- simple: it includes only one consonant as in /mak.tab/ office and  
/jif.ham/ he understands.  
- complex: it includes two consonants, it only occurs in a final position, as 
in /ward/ roses, /ku.rumb/ cabbages and /ka.tabt/ I wrote. 
The MSA coda thus has some restrictions, since it only allows one 
consonant in word medial position (Broselow, 1992), and not more than 
two consonants word finally. 
 
MSA Coda Parameters: 
 - 
Coda allowed? (yes) 
 - 
Coda clusters allowed? (yes) 
 - 
Restrictions: Medial (not more than one consonant) 
 
                     Final (not more than two consonants)

3.4.1.4 Rime 
The MSA rime can have one of the following forms:   
- 
 non-branching: it includes only a nucleus with a short vowel as in  
/na.ݧam/ yes.  
- 
branching as follows: 
•  complex nucleus: a long vowel as in CV: syllables: /kara:si/ chairs 
and UHݶOH ‘his legs’. 
•  simple nucleus + simple coda as in CVC syllables: \LKݶLP he 
attacks and /saݧ.tak/ your (m. sing.) watch. 
•  simple nucleus + complex coda as in CVCC syllables: /?ibn/ son 
and /?ism/ name. 
•  complex nucleus + simple coda as in CV:C syllables: /ݧi:d/ feast 
/mo:z/ bananas and /be:t/ home. 
•  complex nucleus + complex coda as in CV:CC syllables, which 
commonly occur in Classical Arabic, but less frequently in MSA: 
/ma:rr/ passer-by and /ha:mm/ important.  
 
MSA Rime Parameters: 
 - non-branching? (yes) 
Restrictions: simple nucleus with V  
- branching? (yes) 
Restrictions: CV:, CVC, CVCC, CV:C and CV:CC 
MSA Rime Template: 
R [VC], as in the CVC pattern 
R [VCC], as in the CVCC pattern 
R [V], as in the CV  
R [V:], as in CV: patterns 
hence *R [VCCC] 
The syllable structure parameter settings of MSA are as follows:  
VV nucleus allowed? 
 
No (but V: allowed) 
C nucleus allowed? 
 
No 
Onset clusters allowed? 
  
No 
Coda allowed? 
 
 
Yes 
Coda Restrictions? 
 
Yes (not more than two) 
For clarity, this is displayed in the following diagram:

MSA Maximal Syllable: 
 
It is expected that syllabification differences between MSA and English 
lead to errors in main word stress placement by MSA speakers. This will 
be explained in detail in Chapter 4: Results and Analysis.  
3.4.2 Arabic Syllable Types 
MSA syllable has been studied by many linguists (Brame, 1970; 
Broselow, 1979; McCarthy, 1979b; Selkirk 1981; among others), who find 
themselves in total agreement that the language’s syllable inventory 
includes six syllable types: CV, CVC, CV:, CV:C, CVCC (Broselow, 
1988, Buell, 1996) and CV:CC (Mitchell, 1960), as follows: 
(9) a. CV 
/laban/ 
 
‘milk’ 
 
b. CV: 
/sa:kin/  
‘inhabited (m. sg.)’ 
 
c. CVC 
/markaz/  
‘centre’ 
 
d. CV:C 
/mida:n/  
‘square’ 
 
e. CVCC 
/katabt/  
‘I wrote’ 
 
f. CV:CC /ma:rr/  
‘passer-by’ 
 
The last three types usually appear at the end of a phonological word. In 
these last three types, the durations of the consonants and vowels are 
known to be longer than the other remaining types. The number of vowels 
and the number of syllables in an Arabic phrase must be equal. 
All the syllable structures in (9) exist both in Classical Arabic and in some 
modern dialects including MSA. CV is a light syllable, CV: and CVC are 
considered heavy syllables and CV:C and CVCC are superheavy syllables 
(Broselow, 1992). The first three types are considered by Al-Ani and May 
(1973) and McCarthy (1979a, b) as unmarked in terms of their 
distribution, since they occur more frequently than CV:C, CVCC and 
CV:CC. 

Chapter Three 
 
92 
The internal structure of the six syllables above can be represented, as 
follows. 
 
The structures in (10b) and (10c) are very similar – consisting of a simple 
onset and a branching rime. In (10b) the nucleus is branching with a long 
vowel without a coda, whereas in (10c) the rime contains a short vowel 
followed by a consonant. 
The above MSA syllable types show the following: 
- No syllable begins with a vowel, namely, onsets are obligatory  
(McCarthy and Prince, 1990). 
- A syllable may contain either a short vowel as in (10a, c, e) or a long  
vowel as in (10b, d, f). But it never contains a diphthong. 
- The rime may contain one, two or zero consonants. 
 
MSA grammarians agree that, as in many Semitic languages, the CCA 
syllable takes one of the following forms: light, heavy and superheavy 
(Buell, 1996), as I show below.

3.4.2.1 Light Syllable 
The MSA light syllable is composed of a simple peak vowel, obligatorily 
preceded by a simple consonant onset. This CV syllable cannot be found 
as a monosyllabic word. This is the result of the minimal word restriction 

Chapter Three 
 
94 
which requires MSA words to be bimoraic. MSA light syllables are CV 
(McCarthy and Prince, 1990). The CV type is the most frequent, natural 
and the least marked, whereas the CVCC is much less natural or more 
marked (Cairns and Feinstein 1982). The CV syllable is the minimal 
syllable type in MSA (Blevins, 1995).  
3.4.2.2 Heavy Syllable 
In MSA, a heavy syllable has a simple consonant onset and a branching 
rime. This rime incorporates either a one consonant coda (CVC) or a long-
vowelled nucleus (CV:). The CV: type has some restrictions on its 
distribution. It is least frequent word finally, more frequent word medially 
and most frequent word initially (Watson, 2002). CV and CVC are the 
most frequent types because there are no restrictions of any kind on their 
distribution – they can occur in any position in the MSA word. MSA 
heavy syllables are CV: and CVC (McCarthy and Prince, 1990). The 
vowel in a CVC syllable must be fully pronounced – it cannot be reduced 
to another vowel. 
3.4.2.3 Superheavy Syllable 
MSA superheavy syllables are highly marked: they are limited to the word 
final position (Buell, 1996; Watson, 2002). Broselow (1992, 10) explains 
the reason behind MSA superheavy syllable restriction to word-final 
position by stating that ‘the restriction of superheavy syllables to 
morpheme-final position derives from the provision that only peripheral 
syllables may be ‘incomplete’, in accord with the widespread ability of 
peripheral elements to escape the structural restrictions operating 
elsewhere in a language by being marked extraprosodic’. The maximal 
word-internal syllables are heavy CV: and CVC. Superheavy syllables are 
composed of a heavy syllable plus a consonant: CV:C and CVCC. Prince 
(1983, 67) states that ‘the superheavy ultima is naturally analyzed into two 
rimes - VVC = VV+C, VCC = VC+C - since rimes may generally be at 
most VV or VC’. MSA superheavy syllables always attract main stress (de 
Lacy, 1998).  
3.4.2.4 Extraheavy Syllable 
I suggest that MSA syllable types should include an additional extraheavy 
syllable which is CV:CC. This syllable type is the least frequent, since it is 
restricted to monosyllabic words. Mitchell (1960, 371) states that 
‘CVVCC is, in fact, rare and almost wholly associated with 
monosyllables’. This explains why many studies do not include this

3.4.3 English Syllable Structure 
This section deals with the structural constituents of the English syllable, 
onset, nucleus and coda and their restrictions. 
3.4.3.1 Onset 
In English, onsets are optional (Hammond, 1999), in the sense that a 
syllable may or may not begin with a consonant, as shown below: 
(16) a. 
face 
teach  
b. 
ace 
 
each 
 
 
meat 
miser  
 
eat 
 
area 
 
 
cake 
feather   
ache 
 
upset 
 
The syllable structure of some of these words is as follows: 
(17)  a. ‘face’  
 
 
b. ‘ace’ 
 

Chapter Three 
 
96 
 Harris (1994, 53) states that in English ‘the onset can contain between 
zero and three positions’. The permissable English onsets, therefore, can 
take one of the following three forms:  
- simple C: one consonant as in mind and rose. 
- complex CC: two consonants as in play and trap. 
- complex sCC: three consonants as in string and spleen. 
 
English onset templates: 
 
[ ] [C] [CC] [sCC] 
 
English onset parameters: 
- onset (optional) 
- onset clusters allowed? (yes) 
- restrictions: not more than three consonants 
 
More specifically, the English onset may be (Hammond, 1999): 
-absent - a sonorant - an obstruent 
-an obstruent followed by a consonant 
-or any of the above preceded by an /s/  
-the minimal English onset is zero consonants (Harris, 1994). 
-the maximal English onset is three consonants (Harris, 1994). 
 
When English words are syllabified, the ‘Onset Maximisation Principle’ 
should be followed as far as possible (Harris, 1994): in English, maximal 
formation of onsets takes priority over formation of codas (Harris, 1994). 
This means that syllables should be divided, so that the maximum number 
of consonants is assigned to the onset of the syllable on the right, rather 
than to the coda of the syllable to the left, provided that they do not violate 
English phonotactic rules (Goldsmith, 1990), as shown in the following 
examples:

sur.prise  /sԥ.'praǹz/  
*surp.rise /sԥp.'raǹz/

97 
These are the constraints on English onsets (Gimson, 1970): 
 -  The two sounds ƾ and ݤ cannot occur in the onset of any English 
syllable. 
 -  The first consonant in a CCV syllable cannot be an affricate, ݹ ݶ 
or a sonorant /m, n, ƾ l, r, w/ or an /h/ (Hammond, 1999). 
 -  English CCCV syllables always begin with /s/ (Hammond, 1999). 
 
3.4.3.2 Nucleus 
The nucleus is the only obligatory constituent of the English syllable 
(Goldsmith, 1990). The English nucleus can take one of the following 
forms (Harris, 1994): 
• simple (V): only one short vowel as in bed and cut. 
• 
complex: as in one of the following shapes: 
-  (V:): only a long vowel as in see and blue. 
-  (VV): a diphthong as in cow and fly. 
-  (VVV): a triphthong as in flour and fire. 
-  a syllabic consonant: a non-vocalic nucleus. Although English 
nuclei normally contain vowels, they can accept a sonorant 
consonant under pressure from the sonority profile of the 
segmental sequence, such as /l/ in bottle and middle, and the 
nasals /m/ and /n/ / as in rhythm and button respectively. 
 
Correspondingly, the syllable structure is now exemplified:

English nucleus parameters: 
-V nucleus allowed? (yes) 
-V: nucleus allowed? (yes) 
-VV nucleus allowed? (yes) 
-VVV nucleus allowed? (yes) 
-C nucleus allowed? (yes) 
English nucleus templates: 
 [V][V:][VV][VVV][C] 
3.4.3.3 Coda 
All consonants of English except [h] can appear as a single-consonant 
coda (Hammond, 1999). Harris (1994, 53) points out that in English ‘the 
coda part of the rhyme can contain between zero and four positions’. 
Therefore, the English coda can have one of the following forms: 
• Simple: one consonant, as in fit and red. 
• Complex; as in one of the following shapes: 
 - CC: two consonants, as in lift and mind. 
 - CCC: three consonants, as in against and next. 
 - CCCs: four consonants, as in texts and sixths. 
 
English coda parameters: 
 
 -coda allowed? (yes) 
 -coda clusters allowed? (yes) 
 -restrictions: medial (not more than two consonants) 
       
       final (not more than four consonants) 
English coda templates: 
 [C] [CC] [CCC] [CCCs] 
The minimal English coda is, therefore, one consonant, and the maximal 
four. The syllable structure is as follows: 
 

Chapter Three 
 
100 
 
A different set of restrictions apply to coda consonants (Hammond, 1999): 
 -  In one consonant codas, almost any consonant can occur 
(exceptions: /w, j, h/). 
 -  In two consonant codas, the second must be an obstruent (wax, 
waft, adze etc.). (NB. nasal stops are not classed as obstruents 
(Trask, 1996)).  

English and Arabic Sounds and Word Stress  
 
101 
 -  Any of the above possibilities may be followed by an /s/. 
 -  The minimal English coda is zero. 
 -  The maximal English coda has four consonants, as in ‘texts’. 
 
3.4.3.4 Rime 
The English rime can take one of the following forms (Hayes, 1995): 
-  Non-branching: it only includes a nucleus (V, V: or VV), without 
coda, as in banana, city, bee and play. 
-  Branching: as follows (Fudge, 1969; Selkirk, 1982; Goldsmith, 
1990; Harris, 1994): 
•  simple nucleus + simple coda, as in hut and bit. 
•  simple nucleus + complex coda (C2-4), as in song and felt / lifts 
and hands / tempts and contexts. 
•  complex nucleus + simple coda, as in feet and roof. 
•  complex nucleus + complex coda (C2-3), as in feels, joint and 
waste / fields and points.  
 
English rime parameters: 
 -non-branching? (yes) 
 restrictions: nucleus with V, V: or VV 
 -branching? 
(yes) 
 restrictions:  
VC, VCC, VCCC, VCCCC 
VC, VVC 
 
  
V: / VV + CC or CCC 
 
English rime template: 
[V][VCC][VCCC] [VCCCC] 
[V:C][VVC] 
[V:CC][V:CCC] 
[VVCC] [VVCCC] 
 
Correspondingly, the structures are as follows:

English has certain limitations on the form of heavy syllables. 
-  Long vowels and diphthongs can occur in both open (see /si:/, pay 
/peܼ and closed (team /ti:m/, weight ZHܼW heavy syllables. 
-  Short vowels only occur in closed heavy syllables (fat /fæt/, ink 
ܼƾN 
 
 

English and Arabic Sounds and Word Stress  
 
103 
Heavy syllables have different types of rimes: 
 -  a syllable ending in VC has a branching rime with a non-branching 
nucleus and coda, as in sun VݞQ and got JܥW 
 -  a syllable ending in VV has a branching nucleus, as in tree /tri:/, 
and saw Vܧ 
 -  a syllable ending in VVC has a branching rime with a branching 
nucleus, as in feet /fi:t/ and fall IܧO 
 
The corresponding rime structures of English heavy syllables are as 
follows: 
 
In describing the phonotactics of the English syllable, linguists have 
focussed on restrictions concerning which phonemes may occupy which 
slots of the syllable. Research shows that in English CVC words, there is a 
significant connection between the vowel (nucleus) and the following 
consonant (coda) (Goldsmith, 2011). By contrast, no significant 
associations are found between the initial consonant (onset) and the 
nucleus.  
3.4.4 English Syllable Types 
English syllables are complex, and understanding them paves the way to 
understanding syllables universally. There are many types of syllable in 
English. English phonotactics show that the basic configuration or 
template of an English syllable is (C)V(C), with an optional onset and 
coda and an obligatory nucleus. It is therefore, the nucleus, that is the 
essential part of the rime and of the whole syllable. 
English can thus have a syllable that does not have a coda and therefore 
ending in a vowel, having an open syllable with the (C)V- structure, and a 
syllable with a coda and therefore ending in a consonant, a closed syllable 
- of the type (C)VC-. In English open and closed syllables are clearly 
related to weight – open syllables can be heavy (CVV) or light (CV) and 

Chapter Three 
 
104 
closed syllables are always heavy (CVC, VC, VCC etc.): 
(26) a. open heavy syllable CVV 
b. closed heavy syllable VCC 
c. light syllable CV (always open) 
 
In English word phonotactics are based on syllable phonotactics. This 
means that only clusters which can begin a syllable can begin a word and 
only a possible cluster at the end of a syllable can end a word. A word like 
‘instruct’ can be divided into well-formed syllables /in.struct/ because the 
word final and initial syllables consist of possible constraints in English.  
English has the following syllable structure parameter settings: 
VV/V: nucleus allowed? Yes 
C nucleus allowed? 
Yes 
Onset clusters allowed? 
Yes 
Coda allowed? 
 
Yes 
Coda restrictions? 
Yes (not more than four)  
Structurally, the English syllable can be described as having the maximal 
length CCCVCCCC, as in ‘strengths’, and the minimal length V, as in the 
first syllable in ‘e.ver’. It follows that no English syllable or word begins 
with more than three consonants and ends with more than four consonants 
(Harris, 1994), where the first and last consonants must be /s/, as in 
‘strengths’. For clarity this is displayed in the following diagram:

In English, onsets, nuclei and codas may have more than one constituent, 
and each constituent occupies a single slot. Therefore, a diphthong or a 
long vowel in a complex (branching) nucleus will occupy two slots. 
Similarly, each consonant in a complex onset or coda will occupy a single 
slot. This is shown in the English syllable ground /grașnd/, in which all 
three elements branch: 
 
There is one exception to the rule that a syllable must have a vowel as its 

Chapter Three 
 
106 
nucleus. This occurs when a certain vowel-like consonants - /l/, /r/ or a 
nasal- act as the centre of the syllable, as in the following examples. 
 little /l/          button /n/ 
 middle /l/      literal /r-l/ 
 rhythm /m/   Hungary /r/ 
 
This is shown in the English word ‘little’ where the final [l] is syllabic. 
 
3.4.4.1 Light Syllable 
An English light syllable is a syllable with neither a long nucleus nor a 
coda (Blevins, 1995) as in ‘'camera’ and ‘'salary’. This syllable is referred 
to as CV and is considered as an open syllable, as shown below in a tree 
representation of the English word ‘'cinema’. 
 
There are many words in English that have light syllables as part of their 
syllabic structure, as shown below. 
(32) a.  'colony    'negative 
            'comedy  'minimal 
            'cavity     'positive

107 
 b. gra'mmatical     'ceremony 
     pho'tographer   pa'rameter 
     'relevant           capa'bility 
 
The examples in (32) have light syllables, with one of them in every word 
receiving stress. However, the location of stress in English depends on the 
distribution of heavy syllables and their rime structures as explained in 
section (3.4.5) which compares MSA and English syllable structures.  
3.4.4.2 Heavy Syllable 
The definition of a heavy syllable is language-specific in the sense that it 
varies from one language to another (Hayes, 1995). In English, a heavy 
syllable is a syllable with a branching nucleus or a branching rime. A 
branching nucleus means the syllable has a long vowel as [i:] in ‘in'crease’ 
or a diphthong as [aܼ] in ‘re'ply’. This syllable referred to as CVV or CV: 
and is considered as an open syllable. A branching rime means the syllable 
has a coda, as [t] in ‘hat’ and [n] in ‘a'genda’. This syllable is referred to as 
(VC, CVC, CVCC etc.) is considered a closed syllable. The two types of 
English heavy syllable are shown below in a tree representation of the 
English words ‘pen’, ‘pay’ and ‘pea’. 
 

Chapter Three 
 
108
English has many words that include a heavy syllable in different 
positions, as shown in the examples: 
(34) a. res'pect      a'bandon                     b.'way'      play 
           re'member  re'minder'                      say        'stay 
           de'termine  de'pendant                     be'have  pro'vide  
 
       c. 'see   de'crease 
           'we   'teacher 
           'bee'  sheep  
 
The examples in (34a) have a heavy syllable with a branching rime, 
whereas the ones in (34b and c) have a heavy syllable with a branching 
nucleus - a diphthong and a long vowel, respectively. All these examples 
show that a heavy syllable has a relationship with stress placement in 
English.  
3.4.5 Comparison of MSA and English Syllable Structures  
and Implications for L2 Acquisition 
In this section, the similarities and differences between MSA and English 
syllable structures are compared and the previous description is translated 
into parameter settings, following Fikkert (1994). This explains the 
distance between MSA and English syllable structures.  
The similarities and differences between MSA and English syllable 
structures are summarised in Table 3.

Each syllable constituent is now discussed in detail.  
ONSET: 
The differences between English and MSA onsets are represented 
graphically in (35): 
 
With respect to onsets, English allows the possible onset that MSA does 
and some more (i.e. the MSA onset is a subset of English onsets). More 
specifically, English allows a complex CC onset and an extrametrical 
element that is adjoined to the left of a well formed onset. This description 
can be expressed in terms of parameter settings, following Fikkert (1994, 
108) who has suggested the following three settings for the onset 
parameter: 
(36) Onset Parameter: 
 a. Number of onsets is equal to 1 On = 1  
 b. Number of onsets is equal to or smaller than 1On  1 
 c. Number of onsets is equal to or smaller than 2On  2 
           where c         b          a and means ‘implies’  
The default onset parameter setting would be a, since both MSA and 
English have the ‘one consonant’ onset parameter setting. Using L1 
positive transfer of onset parameter setting, the Arabic learners will not 
find difficulty in producing ‘the one consonant’ English onset. The 
learners, however, will have difficulty in producing the two different 
English onsets (CC and sCC) and will have to find some strategies of L2 
syllable repair in order to transfer these English onsets into acceptable 
MSA onsets. Broselow (1984) states that: 

Chapter Three 
 
110
(37) Errors involving consonant clusters generally occur when these clusters 
must be analyzed as belonging to syllable structures which are not 
permitted in the native language, and the mispronunciation of the clusters 
represents an attempt by the language learner to bring the second language 
forms into conformity with the first language restrictions defining possible 
syllables. 
 
Epenthesis is the L2 syllable repair strategy used by the MSA speakers to 
deal with the English onset CC and sCC. They tend to insert epenthetic 
vowel [i] between the first and the second consonants of the English onset 
‘CC’. They also tend to insert a glottal stop plus epenthetic vowel /?i/ 
before the first consonant of this type of onsets in order to form an 
acceptable MSA syllable /CVC/.The first consonant will be the coda of the 
first syllable and the second consonant the onset of the second syllable, as 
shown below.  
(38) Errors in English Onsets by MSA Speakers 
 (CC Onset) 
 English ‘CC’ OnsetError 
 'play  */bi'lay/ 
 'slide */si'laid/, /?is'laid/ 
 'floor */fi'loor/, /?if'loor/  
 'criticise */kiriti'saiz/  
 
When faced with the English onset ‘sCC’, the MSA speakers insert a /?i/ 
before the first consonant ‘s’ forming a MSA syllable /CVC/ ‘/?is/, and 
then they break the ‘CC’ cluster by inserting [i] between the ‘CC’, as 
shown below.  
(39) Errors in English Onsets by MSA Speakers 
 (sCC Onset) 
 English ‘sCC’ Onset Error 
 street  */?isti'ri:t/, /sit'ri:t/  
 spring */?isbi'ring/ 
 spleen */?isbi'leen/  
 splash */?isbi'lash/ 
  
As shown in (38) and (39), epenthesis lead to resyllabification of the 
English words and change of main word stress location. 
Finally, with respect to onsetless English words such as ‘award’, ‘institute’ 
and ‘observe’, the MSA speakers tend to insert a /?/ before the vowel, 
since onsetless syllables are impossible in MSA, as shown below. 

English and Arabic Sounds and Word Stress  
 
111 
(40) English Onsetless word Error 
 'institute    */?inistit'ju:t/  
 a'ward       *?a'ward/  
 'applicant  */?appli'cant/ 
 
 
The MSA speakers, therefore, have to realize the following differences 
between English and MSA onsets: 
(a) Onsets are optional in English but obligatory in MSA. 
(b) MSA onset is a subset of English onsets. 
(c) MSA onset must begin with one and only one consonant, whereas 
English can have complex onsets (‘CC’ or ‘sCC’) and simple onset 
(‘C’). 
(d) In English ‘onset maximization principle’ should be followed as far 
as possible, whereas, MSA only allows a single consonant onset. 
 
NUCLEUS: 
The differences between English and MSA nuclei are represented 
graphically in (41):  
 
MSA nuclei are a subset of English nuclei. Both languages allow binary 
branching. However, an important difference between MSA and English 
nuclei is that in English the nucleus can be occupied by a long vowel (V:), 
a diphthong (VV) or a triphthong (VVV), whereas MSA does not, have 
diphthong or triphthongs, so the binary branching can only involve a long 
vowel. English also allows a syllabic nucleus as /l/ in ‘bottle’, /m/ in 
‘rhythm’ and /n/ in ‘button’, whereas MSA does not allow this nucleus. 
Fikkert (1994, 108) suggests the following parameter: 
 

Chapter Three 
 
112
(42) Branching Nucleus Parameter: 
The nucleus can be branching [No, Yes]. 
 
The default nucleus parameter setting would be (V) and (V:), since both 
MSA and English have two nuclei. Therefore, the Arabic learners will not 
find difficulty in producing the English nuclei (V) and (V:), if they 
positively transfer the L1 MSA nucleus parameter settings into the English 
nucleus parameter settings. However, the learners will find difficulty in 
producing the three different English nuclei (VV,VVV and syllabic C). 
Therefore, they are expected to produce the English VV and VVV nuclei 
as a V: nucleus and insert an epenthetic vowel [i] before the syllabic 
nucleus to form a CVC syllable as in ‘middle’, /middile/ and ‘rhythm’ 
/rhythim/.  
CODA: 
The difference between English and MSA codas are represented 
graphically in (43): 
 
As in the case of onsets and nuclei, the MSA codas are a subset of English 
codas in the sense that English allows all the possible codas that MSA 
does and some more. In addition to C and CC codas, English has the 
complex codas CCC and CCCs as in ‘strength’ and ‘tempts’. Therefore, it 
is expected that the Arabic learners will find difficulty in producing the 
English codas CCC and CCCs and will tend to break these consonant 
clusters by inserting an [i] before the final C in a CCC coda /CCiC/ as in 
‘strength’ /strengith/ and between the CC and Cs in a CCCs coda /CCiCs/ 
as in ‘tempts’ /tempits/. This changes these English codas to similar MSA 
codas.

113 
RIME: 
The differences between English and MSA rimes are represented 
graphically in (44): 
 
As in the case of onsets, nuclei and codas, MSA rimes are a subset of 
English rimes. English allows all the possible MSA rimes and some more. 
In addition to VC, VCC, V:C and VVC and the complex rimes, English 
has the rimes V, V:, VCC and the complex rimes VCCC, VCCCs, V:CCC, 
VVCC and VVCC. Following Fikkert (1994), we add the following 
maximal rime parameter: 
(45) Maximal Rime parameter:  
 a. The maximal number of rime consonants is =1 
 b. The maximal number of rime consonants is  2  
 c. The maximal number of rime consonants is  3 
 d. The maximal number of rime consonants is  4 
where d ĺ c ĺ b ĺ a and means ‘implies’  
 The English setting would be d and the MSA setting would be b. 
Therefore, it is expected that the Arabic learners of L2 English will find 
difficulty in producing the English complex rimes which end in C3-4, since 
MSA only allows rimes with a maximum of two consonants. They, 
therefore, will tend to insert an [i] before the final C in a CCC coda /CCiC/ 
and between the CC and Cs in a CCCs coda /CCiCs/ in order to form 
acceptable rimes in MSA. 
The relationship between rime structure and main stress placement in 
MSA and English is now explained.

 As shown in Table 4 and 5, syllable weight (rime structure) is an 
important factorin determining main stress placement in both MSA and 
English, since bothlanguages are quantity sensitive. They are both similar 
in some points. First, ifthe penultimate syllable is heavy in MSA words 
and English nouns only, it is stressed. Second, if the final syllable is heavy 
CV: or superheavy CV:C/CVCC in MSA and heavy in English verbs only, 
it is stressed. Using positive transfer, the Arabic learners will not find 
difficulty in stressing English nouns having a stressed heavy penult and

English verbs having a stressed heavy final syllable, if they realise the 
relationship between lexical class, rime structure and main stress 
placement in English. 
 Having examined the MSA and English syllable structures and syllable 
types, I now turn to an examination and comparison of the stress systems 
in both languages and explain implications for L2 English stress 
acquisition. 
3.5 Word Stress 
This section deals with the stress patterns of Modern Standard Arabic 
(MSA), MSA stress and syllable structure, MSA stress and syllable weight 
and Arabic word stress rules. It also explains English word stress rules.  
3.5.1 Arabic Word Stress 
3.5.1.1 The Stress Patterns of Arabic 
Watson (2011) describes the stress facts of MSA, as shown below.  
(46) a) Stress is on the last syllable, if it is superheavy or final CV:. 
 
 b) Otherwise, stress is on the penult, if it is heavy. 
 
 c) Otherwise, stress is on the antepenult if the penul is light.  
 
The stress pattern in (46) sheds light on some points that are indicative of 
the type and order of stress assignment rules in MSA. First, a final syllable 
does not attract stress unless it is superheavy as in /ka'tabt/ ‘I wrote’ and 
/bu'ju:t/ ‘houses’ or heavy as in /?a'bu:/ ‘his father’. Second, syllable 
weight distinction is asymmetric word-internally and word-finally. Hayes 
(1995) explains this point by stating that syllable quantity is crucial in 
analysing the MSA stress system – in non-final position, the weight 
distinction is the ordinary one, opposing light CV syllables to all heavier 
syllables, whereas in final position, it is again binary but on a different 
basis: the syllable types CV:C, CVCC and CVV attract stress, while CVC 
and CV do not. This is viewed as a case of consonant extrametricality, 
which reduces heavy CVC to light CV<C> in final position while 
retaining final CV:, CVC<C>, CV:<C> as heavy.  
3.5.1.2 Arabic Stress and Syllable Structure 
There are six syllable types in MSA syllable inventory: 

Chapter Three 
 
116 
(47) a. CV(light) /bi/ ‘in’ 
 b. CV: (heavy) /ma:/ ‘not (neg. particle)’ 
 
 c. CVC (heavy) /min/ ‘from’ 
 d. CV:C  (superheavy) /ba:b/‘door’ 
 e. CVCC (superheavy) /nahr/ ‘river’ 
 f. CV:CC (extraheavy) /ݧDPP/ ‘public’ 
 
Most syllables can receive main stress as in (48): 
 
(48) I Stress on a Light Penult: 
 a. 'hi.na ‘here’ 
 b. 'sa.ma ‘sky’ 
 c. 
ȖDGD ‘lunch’ 
 d. 'da.wa ‘medicine’ 
___________________________________________________________ 
 II Stress on a Light Antepenult: 
 a.'ka.ta.ba ‘he wrote' 
 b.'ma.li.ka‘ queen’ 
 c.'bu.xa.la‘ misers’ 
 G
ݕXUDND  ‘partners’ 
___________________________________________________________ 
 III Stress on a Heavy Penult: 
 a. 'mak.tab‘an office’ 
 b. 'ka:tib’ ‘a writer’ 
 c. 'na:mat’ ‘she slept’ 
 d. 'nim.ra ‘number’ 
___________________________________________________________ 
 IV Stress on a Final Superheavy: 
 a. ka.'tabt ‘I wrote’ 
 b. da.'xalt ‘I went in’ 
 d. fi.'himt ‘I understood’ 
___________________________________________________________ 
 V Stress on a Final (CV:): 
 a. ?a.'bu: ‘his father’ 
 c. ?a.'xu: ‘his brother’ 
 d. da.ra.'bu: ‘they hit him’ 
 
The lists of words in (48) show two crucial factors. First, syllable weight 
has a considerable effect on stress placement in MSA, since heaviness 
seems to attract stress. Second, stress never goes beyond the antepenultimate 
syllable which means that it is always inside a three syllable window. This 
shows that main word stress in MSA falls into one of three categories: 
ultimate, penultimate and antepenultimate stress.

3.5.1.3 Arabic Stress and Syllable Weight 
Modern Standard Arabic, Classical Arabic and all dialects of Arabic are 
said to have been quantity sensitive (Kenstowicz, 1994) in the sense that 
syllable weight played a major role in stress assignment. McCarthy 
(1979a, 443) states that ‘it is this distinction between heavy and light 
syllables that affects the placement of stress’. MSA is a quantity sensitive 
language in the sense that it is syllable weight - heavy or superheavy - that 
determines where to place main stress (Buell, 1996). 
The relationship between syllable weight and stress assignment in MSA 
can be seen in (49): 
(49) a. /?a'ݶa:za/ ‘holiday’ b. /fa'ransa/ ‘France’ 
           /ki'ta:bi/ ‘my book’      /mu'handis/‘an engineer (m.sing)’ 
           /Ha'di:qa/‘garden’        /?u'rubbi/‘European (m.sing) 
        c. /'malika/ ‘queen’ 
            /'Talaba/ ‘students’ 
            /'buxala/ ‘misers’ 
 
In (49a and b), all the MSA words have a penultimate syllable with a 
branching rime –v: in (49a) and -vc in (49b). This shows that the heavy 
penultimate syllable is the reason behind their stress. In (49c), all the MSA 
words have a penultimate syllable with a non-branching rime -CV, i.e. a 
light penult. As a consequence, theantepenultimate syllable is stressed 
rather than the penultimate, following the MSA stress pattern 
'CVCVCV(C). This illustrates the relationship between syllable weight 
and stress in MSA.  
A heavy syllable in MSA does not always attract stress. For example, a 
heavy antepenult in MSA is not stressed, as shown below. 
 (50) ]DZ
EDݧD ‘storm’       /kah'raba/‘electricity’ 
         /tak'mila/‘completion’ /muݕ'kila/‘problem’ 
         /sil'sila/‘chain’             /mak'nasa/ ‘broom’ 
 
All MSA words in (50) have a heavy antepenultimate syllable. However, 
this syllable is not stressed in spite of its weight. This is due to the lack of 
syllable extrametricality in MSA. In addition, in MSA, a final - CVC does 
not attract stress as shown in the following examples. 

Chapter Three 
 
118 
(51) a. (light CV + heavy CVC) 
/'wa.lad/‘boy’ /'ku.war/ ‘balls’ 
/'ka.tab/ ‘he wrote’ /'la.ban/‘milk’ 
/'mu.dun/ ‘cities’ 
___________________________________________________ 
b. (light CV + heavy CVC/CV: + heavy CVC) 
/mu.'han.dis/‘engineer (m.sing)’/mu.'mașșil/ ‘actor (m.sing)’ 
/mu.'dar.ris/ ‘teacher (m.sing)’ /ji.'fah.him/‘to explain’ 
___________________________________________________ 
 c. (heavy CVC/CV: + heavy CVC) 
/'yik.tib/ ‘he writes’/'mar.kib/ ‘ship’ 
/'mad.xal/‘entrance’ /'yih.ݶim/ ‘he attackes’ 
 
The MSA words in all the sets in (51) have a final heavy CVC syllable. 
However, this syllable does not attract stress. This is due to 
extrametricality which requires the last consonant of MSA words to be 
completely invisible to the rules which assign stress. This process, in turn, 
alters the final syllable from heavy CVC to light CV<C>. Then stress 
lands on another suitable syllable according to MSA stress rules. Two 
points can be noticed. First, extrametricality does not apply to a final long 
vowel. Second, a heavy syllable makes a foot on its own. 
A type of MSA syllable can attract stress even after marking the last 
consonant extrametrical: superheavy syllable – CV:C or CVCC. 
Extrametricality changes this superheavy syllable CV:C/CVCC into a 
heavy ultimate CV: or CVC, which still attracts stress according to MSA 
stress rules. In addition, final CV: is counted as heavy in MSA, although it 
is treated as light in Classical Arabic. As a consequence, in MSA a final 
CV: attracts stress, as in /ݦa'bu:/ his father’and kata'bu:/ they wrote it’.  
McCarthy (1979b, 446) explains that in MSA ‘there are two binary 
syllable weight distinctions, light versus heavy word-internally, and light 
and heavy versus superheavy word-finally’. The relationship between 
syllable weight and stress in MSA is pointed out by Hayes (1995, 68), who 
states that syllable quantity is crucial in analysing MSA stress system: 
(52)  In nonfinal position, the weight distinction is ordinary, opposing light  
CV syllables to all heavier syllable. In final position, the opposition is 
again binary but on a different basis: the syllable types CV:C, CVCC 
and CV: attract stress, while CVC and CV do not. 
Hayes (ibid) analyses this ‘as a case of consonant extrametricality: this 
demotes heavy CVC to light CV<C> in final position while retaining final 
CV:, CVC<C>, CV:<C> as heavy’. 

English and Arabic Sounds and Word Stress  
 
119 
To sum up, syllable weight is regarded as a very important factor in 
determining stress placement in MSA. This shows that a heavy syllable in 
a particular position in a MSA word attracts stress and in the absence of 
such a syllable, some positionally defined light syllable will be stressed. 
3.5.1.4 Arabic Word Stress Rules 
(1) Arabic words are stressed on the last syllable when they end in: 
a) a long vowel or a long vowel plus a consonant: 
 
/saka'ki:n/ ‘knives’ 
/ki'ta:b/ ‘book’ 
b) a vowel plus two consonants: 
 
/௧a'kalt/ ‘I ate’ /ka'tabt/ ‘I wrote’ 
(2) Words having the syllabic structure CVCVCV(C) are stressed on 
the first syllable (the antepenultimate): 
 
/'kataba/ ‘he wrote’ 
/'buxala/ ‘misers’ 
(3) Words that do not fall in the previous rules are stressed on the 
penultimate syllable: 
 
/muݕ'kila/ ‘problem’ 
/mar'taba/ ‘mattress’ 
(4) Arabic stress never precedes the antepenultimate syllable. 
3.5.2 English Word Stress 
This section provides background information about English stress. It 
explains English word stress rules.  
3.5.2.1 Stress in English 
Learning the stressing of English words is difficult for foreign learners of 
English. In English, stress can be anywhere in the word and the number of 
stressed syllables is not limited to one: in ‘'clarity’ the first syllable is 
stressed, in ‘pe'nultimate’ the second one, in ‘ޙcombi'nation’ stress is on 
the first and the third syllables, in ‘ޙmisޙ re ޙpre'sent’ on the first, the 
second and the fourth etc.  
English stress shift is not always controlled or affected by a change in 
morphological structure, as illustrated below: 
(53) a. 'love, 'lover, 'lovely, 'loveliness 
           pro'duce, pro'ducer, pro'ductive, pro'duction 
       b. 'politics, po'litical, poli'tician 
           'origin,   o'riginal,  origi'nality 
 

Chapter Three 
 
120 
In the morphologically related words in (53a), main stress does not shift, 
but remains on the same stressed syllable in the stem, although the 
morphological structure is changed. By contrast, in the examples in (53b), 
stress moves from one syllable in the stem to another syllable in the 
derivative due to a change in morphological structure. English is a free 
stressed language in the sense that stress does not always fall on a 
definitive syllable, but on any syllable depending on certain factors 
(Kager, 2007). English has a mixture of rhythmic and morphological stress 
systems. It is rhythmic in one level and mainly morphological on another 
level. Hayes (1995, 32) states that ‘English has a rhythmic stress system in 
stems (Level I) but mostly morphological stress for productive affixes 
(Level II)’. 
3.5.2.2 English Word Stress Rules 
(1) Two-syllable words have one stressed syllable either the first or the 
second: 
 
'water'doctorbe'ginfor'geta'ttract 
(2) Words ending in a long vowel (-CV:) or a diphthong (-CVV) are 
often stressed on the first syllable: 
 
'igloo 'beautify  'interview  'multiply  'holiday 
(3) Words ending in a long vowel or a diphthong plus a consonant (-
CVVC) are often stressed on the first syllable: 
'substitute  'criticise  'photograph  'product  'applicant 
(4) Words ending in a vowel plus two consonants (-CVCC) are often 
stressed on the first syllable: 
 
'scientist'management'evident'occupant'impact  
(5) Three-syllable words having the pattern CVCVCV(C) are often 
stressed on the second syllable: 
 
pa'cific  pho'nemic  te'rrific so'licit de'molish  
(6) Words having no long vowel or diphthong are often stressed on the 
antepenultimate syllable or on the penultimate when followed by 
two consonants: 
'calendar  'messenger  'minister a'gendain  'centive 
(7) Some English words of four or more syllables may have the stress 
on the pre-antepenultimate syllable: 
 
'necessary  'category  'helicopter  'aristocrat  'demonstrator 
 
 

English and Arabic Sounds and Word Stress  
 
121 
3.6 Chapter Summary 
This chapter explains English and Modern Standard Arabic sound systems 
(consonants, consonant clusters and vowels), syllable structures and main 
word stress rules. It also compares them and explains their implications for 
L2 English sound production and syllable acquisition. Arabic has thirty-
two consonant sounds, whereas English has twenty-four. The subjects are 
expected to substitute their own Arabic sounds (i.e. L1 negative transfer) 
for the unfamiliar English ones, producing incorrect English sounds. 
Therefore, the subjects will find difficulty in pronouncing some English 
consonants such as /p/, /v/, /ƾ/, dark /ڢ/, syllabic consonants and consonant 
doubling. Regarding consonant clusters, English permits much longer 
initial consonant clusters than Arabic. In addition, initial three-element 
clusters do not occur in Arabic. Therefore, the subjects will also have 
trouble with two-element clusters beginning with /p/, /s/, /g/, /݇/, 
consonant + /j/, /dw/ and all three-element clusters. The subjects are 
expected to insert a vowel between the elements of medial and final 
clusters. Regarding vowels, Arabic has three short vowels and five long 
vowels, whereas English has twelve pure vowels (monophthongs: seven 
short vowels and five long vowels) and eight diphthongs. Therefore, the 
subjects will confuse most of the English vowels and diphthongs with each 
other or substitute Arabic vowels for English ones. Arabic and English 
syllable structure constituents and their phonotactic constraints are also 
compared and show that Arabic onsets, nuclei and codas are subsets of 
corresponding English syllable constituents. Therefore, Arabic speakers 
will attempt to apply the Arabic syllable structure assignment rules to 
English strings. This syllable structure transfer explains certain errors of 
Arabic speakers learning English. Finally, Arabic and English word stress 
rules are explained and the subjects are expected to apply Arabic stress 
rules (i.e. L1 negative transfer) instead of English stress rules, producing 
incorrect English stress patterns. They will stress the last syllable of 
English words ending in V:, V:C and VCC and the first syllable of words 
having the syllabic pattern CVCVCV(C).  
The next chapter deals with the subjects’ errors in English pronunciation 
regarding consonants, consonant clusters, vowels and main word stress 
due to L1 interference in the light of three theories of L2 acquisition: 
Contrastive Analysis (CA), Error Analysis (EA) and Markedness Theory.

4.0 Introduction 
This chapter deals with the subjects’ errors in English pronunciation 
regarding consonants, consonant clusters, vowels and main word stress 
due to L1 interference in the light of three theories of L2 acquisition: 
Contrastive Analysis (CA), Error Analysis (EA) and Markedness Theory. 
The results obtained are specific to the three groups of Arab subjects: 
Egyptians, Libyans and Saudi Arabians. The recorded data were analysed 
in the light of English and Arabic sounds and main word stress placement 
rules. All the interlingual errors found were then singled out and tables 
showing the correct and incorrect pronunciation and forms of main word 
stress were drawn up. This research has two hypotheses. First, the subjects 
substitute their own Arabic sounds (i.e. L1 negative transfer) for the 
unfamiliar English ones, producing incorrect English sounds. Second, the 
subjects apply Arabic stress rules (i.e. L1 negative transfer) instead of 
English ones, producing incorrect English stress patterns. These 
hypotheses were confirmed, albeit to different degrees due to sounds and 
stress patterns (word class), as shown in the results in this chapter.  
The subjects’ errors in English sounds and main word stress are also 
analysed in the light of the various factors that contribute to L1 
interference pointed out by James (1980, 146) in Chapter 1 and are 
restated, as follows. These factors will be considered alongside transfer of 
L1 sounds and word stress rules as possible explanations for the subjects’ 
incorrect sounds and word stress patterns.  
(a) Amount and nature of L2 input: Interference occurs when the L2 
learner’s input is very limited in both ‘quantity’ and ‘scope’. This 
phenomenon can be manifested especially when L2 is learned in an 
L1 environment (schools). 
(b) Level of linguistic analysis: Most research has been done at the 
levels of morphology and syntax rather than at the phonological 

Results 
 
123 
and lexical level. It is because of these two levels that ‘interference’ 
as a linguistic term has been included in the literature.  
(c) Linguistic distance between L1 and L2: Related linguistic systems 
induce the interference phenomenon to manifest itself. Hence, since 
the two languages are different, L2 learners have a tendency to 
transfer the features from L1into L2.  
(d) L2 learning stage: Taylor (1975) pointed out that interference 
phenomenon is more frequent among beginners than among 
advanced learners during the L2 learning process.  
(e) ask focus: Interference is common among L2 learners if the focus 
of L2 is on grammatical forms rather than on ‘communicative 
effectiveness’.  
 
I have prepared the following diagram to display how the English sounds 
and main word stress errors are made by the subjects, showing how Arabic 
and English sounds and stress rules interfere resulting in the subjects’ 
segmental and suprasegmental errors.

Based on Khalifa’s (2017), this model includes four sections: input, L2 
linguistic knowledge, internal (mental) linguistic representations and 
output. The input includes the items which can be divided on the basis of 
familiarity into common and uncommon words. The L2 linguistic 
knowledge can be acquired through exposure to L2 and/or learned through 
formal L2 study. The internal linguistic representations include the 
subjects’ L1 phonological rules and structures such as Arabic 
pronunciation, sounds, main word stress rules, syllable structure and the 
subjects’ current level of L2 English and its phonological rules. Finally, 
the output represents the subjects’ interlanguage and includes their L2 
English sounds and main word stress patterns which reflect their L2 
pronunciation and stress learning strategies. The following factors in the 
model are also expected to show an influence on the subjects’ 
interlanguage. 
(a)  Familiarity: The more common the item and its correct stressing in 
the subjects’ spoken English, the fewer the English sounds and 
word stress errors they make.  
(b) Exposure: The more the subjects’ exposure to native spoken 
English, the fewer their sound and stress errors. Their exposure to 
L2 written English through reading English newspapers and 
magazines and correspondence plays a role in their understanding 
of the meaning of the words but not necessarily in their 
pronunciation.  
(c)  Formal Study: The subjects’ formal study of L2 spoken English is 
expected to affect their interlanguage. For example, factors such as 
classroom learning or school in England, audio and video English 
language courses and learning in Arab countries with native or 
competent non-native teachers of English will improve the 
subjects’ spoken English and lead to fewer sound and stress errors. 
(d) Linguistic Representations: The subjects’ L1 Arabic pronunciation 
and main word stress rules are expected to affect their 
interlanguage by applying these rules to the items (i.e. L1 negative 
or positive transfer). The subjects may also overgeneralise some of 
the L2 English pronunciation and stress rules, producing incorrect 
sounds and stress patterns. 
4.1 The Study 
The subjects were assigned one task. It was a production test that had two 
subparts. In the first subpart, the subject was asked to read aloud a list of 

Chapter Four 
 
126 
English words into a tape recorder. Criteria for selecting the words will be 
described below. The second subpart was a description of a picture in 
which the subject described one page of a stimulus picture as a method of 
collecting spontaneous production data. All the subjects’ descriptions were 
tape recorded. Later, a native English speaking judge phonetically 
transcribed the subjects’ production of the target words and their 
descriptions of the picture focusing on the subjects’ sounds and main word 
stress errors. These production tests were also analysed and transcribed by 
me, the results were compared with the judge’s results and agreement was 
obtained between us on the majority of the items. Most of the 
disagreements were as to whether the subject assigned (a) a primary or 
secondary stress or (b) double main stresses to compounds. 
4.1.1 Experimental Items 
I limited the study to consonants, vowels and main word stress. The first 
part of the production test consisted of three word groups (total 511 words, 
25 classes), each testing different aspects of English consonants, vowels 
and main word stress rules. The first word group (319 words, 10 classes) 
tested errors in English consonants, the second word group (102 words, 7 
classes) tested errors in English vowels and the third word group (90 
words, 8 classes) tested errors in main word stress. The classes of words 
given to all the subjects are now presented, followed by predictions of how 
these words will be pronounced and stressed by the subjects.  
(A) Segmental Errors:  
Word Group I: Consonants (319 words)  
 
All the Group I words have different English consonants in different 
positions. They test the subjects’ pronunciation errors in English plosives, 
fricatives, affricates, nasals, laterals, semi-vowels, consonant clusters, 
letters pronounced in an unexpected way, silent letters, consonant 
doubling and syllabic consonants. Some of these consonants do not occur 
in Arabic. Thus, I would predict that Arabic speakers would have 
difficulty with these English consonants and would substitute their own 
Arabic consonant sounds for the unfamiliar English ones (i.e. L1 negative 
transfer), producing incorrect English consonants. This word group tests 
errors in both English consonants and consonant clusters and consists of 
ten word classes.  
 

Results 
 
127 
Class 1: (Plosives) (20 words)  
All the class one words test the subjects’ pronunciation errors in English 
voiceless and voiced plosives /p/, /b/, /t/, /d/, /k/ and /g/ in initial, medial 
and final positions. Arabic does not have the sound /p/. Therefore, I would 
predict that this sound would be difficult for Arabic speakers. The class 
one words are given in (1):  
(1) park, spark, help, slept, wept, bark, symbol, job, tie, sty, part, die, 
handle, hard, kill, skill, monarch, gill, forget, bag  
Class 2: (Fricatives) (39 words)  
All the class two words test the subjects’ pronunciation errors in English 
voiceless and voiced fricatives /ș/, /ð/, /f/, /v/, /s/, /z/, /ݕ/, /ݤ and /h/ in 
initial, medial and final positions. Arabic does not have the sounds /ș/, /ð/, 
/v/ and /ݤ Therefore, I would predict that these sounds would be difficult 
for Arabic speakers. The class two words are given in (2):  
(2) thumb, method, bath, months, baths, sixth, south, southern, southerly, 
then, leather, bathe, clothes, bathes, smoothes, fine, rifle, off, vine, rival, 
of, sharp, version, ash, pleasure, treasure, rouge, seal, person, bus, cats, 
birds, watches, zeal, busy, buzz, head, behind, haphazard  
Class 3: (Affricates) (8 words)  
All the class three words test the subjects’ pronunciation errors in English 
voiceless and voiced affricatives /ݹ/ and /ݶ/ in initial, medial and final 
positions. The sounds /ݹ/ and /ݶ occur in Arabic. Therefore, I would 
predict that these sounds would not be difficult for Arabic speakers. The 
class three words are given in (3):  
(3) chapter, purchase, church, cello, gem, soldier, judge, lounge  
Class 4: (Nasals) (12 words)  
All the class four words test the subjects’ pronunciation errors in English 
nasals /m/, /n/ and /ƾ/ in initial, medial and final positions. The nasal sound 
/ƾ/ does not occur in Arabic. Therefore, I would predict that this sound 
would be difficult for Arabic speakers. The class four words are given in 
(4):  
(4) man, number, farm, name, hand, bean, thing, singer, singing, longer, 
thank, wings  

Chapter Four 
 
128 
Class 5: (Laterals) (15 words)  
All the class five words test the subjects’ pronunciation errors in English 
laterals /r/ and /l/ in initial, medial and final positions. These laterals occur 
in Arabic. Therefore, I would predict that these sounds would not be 
difficult for Arabic speakers. The class five words are given in (5):  
(5) rubbish, airport, river, far, far from, far from, right, light, leaf, look, 
polite, help, eel, well 
Class 6: (Semi-vowels) (6 words) 
All the class six words test the subjects’ pronunciation errors in English 
semi-vowels in initial, medial and final positions. These semi-vowels 
occur in Arabic. Therefore, I would predict that these sounds would not be 
difficult for Arabic speakers. The class six words are given in (6):  
(6) year, beyond, few, wine, when, which  
 
Class 7: Orthography and Pronunciation  
(7 a): (Letter Sound Mismatch) (11 words) 
All the class (7a) words test the subjects’ pronunciation errors in the 
English sounds which are not represented in the spelling. There is a 
mismatch between English orthography and pronunciation, whereas 
Arabic spelling is simple and virtually phonetic. Therefore, I would predict 
that these letters would be difficult for Arabic speakers. The class (7a) 
words are given in (7):  
(7) enough, hiccough, suite, ewe, cello, cognac, soldier, lounge, lieutenant, 
phlegm, gnaw 
(7 b): (Silent Letters) (24 words) 
All the class (7b) words test the subjects’ pronunciation errors in English 
silent letters. There is a match between Arabic orthography and 
pronunciation and a single letter represents a single sound. Therefore, I 
would predict that these silent letters would be difficult for Arabic 
speakers. The class (7b) words are given in (8):  
 
(8) psalm, corps, subtle, plumb, nestle, fasten, handkerchief, handsome, 
knight, knave, feign, gnarled, alms, salmon, colonel, folklore, heir, 
annihilate, wrath, sword, plough, borough, solemn, damn

(7 c): (Consonant Doubling) (22 words) 
All the class (7c) words test the subjects’ pronunciation errors in English 
consonant doubling (gemination). This gemination is common in Arabic. 
Therefore, I would predict that consonant doubling would be difficult for 
Arabic speakers. The class (7c) words are given in (9): 
(9) stubborn, account, address, odd, affair, suggest, allow, collect, 
accommodation, announcer, inn, support, correct, discuss, attack, attempt, 
butt, puzzle, buzz, midday, misspelled, dissatisfied 
(7 d): (Syllabic Consonants) (16 words) 
All the class (7d) words test the subjects’ pronunciation errors in English 
syllabic consonants. Arabic makes no use of syllabic consonants. 
Therefore, I would predict that the pronunciation of syllabic consonants 
would be difficult for Arabic speakers. The class (7d) words are given in 
(10):  
(10) middle, tunnel, little, panel, rhythm, button, threaten, eleven, Britain, 
cousin, Hungary, hungry, national, literal, visionary, veteran 
Errors in Consonant Clusters (146 words)  
 
 
 
 
Class 8: (Initial Consonant Clusters) (44 words)   
All the class eight words test the subjects’ pronunciation errors in English 
initial two-element and three-element consonant clusters. English permits 
much longer initial consonant clusters than Arabic. In addition, initial 
three-element clusters do not occur in Arabic. Therefore, I would predict 
that these consonant clusters would be difficult for Arabic speakers. The 
class eight words are given in (11):  
(11) plane, black, clean, glass, fleet, sleep, pray, train, creep, brain, drive, 
great, freeze, throw, shrink, pure, beauty, tube, duty, cure, mute, news, 
sue, view, lewd, huge, few, twin, dwarf, queen, thwack, swing, spare, stay, 
scare, smile, snake, sphere, spleen, spring, string, scream, stew, square 
 Class 9: (Medial Consonant Clusters) (11 words)   
All the class nine words test the subjects’ pronunciation errors in English 
medial consonant clusters of more than two consonants within words and 
in connected speech. Arabic does not permit more than two consonants

word-medially. Therefore, I would predict that English medial sequences 
of three or four consonants would be difficult for Arabic speakers. The 
class nine words are given in (12):  
(12) transport, transplant, landscape, handmark, grandmother, grandson, 
long skirt, strange dream, bent screw, next spring, She tempts strangers 
Class 10: (Final Consonant Clusters) (91 words)  
(10 a): (Clusters of two consonants) (52 words): 
All the class (10 a) words test the subjects’ pronunciation errors in English 
final two-element consonant clusters. Arabic permits some two consonant 
clusters word-finally. Therefore, I would predict that Arabic speakers 
would find varying degrees of difficulty with final two-element clusters. 
The class (10 a) words are given in (13):  
(13) grabbed, begged, seemed, cleaned, filled, wronged, proved, bathed, 
raised, helped, marked, coughed, pronounced, published, cabs, seeds, 
flags, arms, pins, songs, loves, smoothes, steals, leaps, seats, backs, 
laughs, eighth, width, warmth, month, length, fifth, wealth, depth, wasp, 
grasp, task, risk, lamp, triumph, faint, dance, rank, bulb, silk, help, belt, 
film, shelf, else, valve 
(10 b): (Clusters of three consonants) (34 words)  
All the class (10 b) words test the subjects’ pronunciation errors in English 
final three-element consonant clusters. Arabic does not permit three-
element consonant clusters word finally. Therefore, I would predict that 
these clusters would be difficult for Arabic speakers. The class (10 b) 
words are given in (14):  
(14) bronzed, filmed, delved, judged, changed, lapsed, taxed, midst, 
jumped, triumphed, touched, sensed, linked, amongst, helped, milked, 
pulsed, grasped, hands, builds, elms, shelves, scripts, facts, camps, 
nymphs, thanks, lifts, lisps, lists, tasks, helps, halts, milks 
(10 c): (Clusters of four consonants) (5 words)  
All the class (10 c) words test the subjects’ pronunciation errors in English 
final four-element consonant clusters. Arabic does not permit four-element 
consonant clusters word finally. Therefore, I would predict that these 
clusters would be difficult for Arabic speakers. The class (10 c) words are 
given in (15):

(15) contexts, tempts, glimpsed, drenched, changed  
Word Group II: (Vowels) (102 words):  
All the Group II words have different English vowels. They test the 
subjects’ pronunciation errors in English short and long vowels, 
diphthongs, easily confused vowels, intrusive vowels, vowel reduction to 
schwa and vowel length. Some of these English vowels do not occur in 
Arabic. Thus, I would predict that Arabic speakers would have difficulty 
with these English vowels and would substitute their own Arabic vowel 
sounds for the unfamiliar English ones (i.e. L1 negative transfer), 
producing incorrect English vowels. This word group consists of seven 
word classes.  
Class 11: (Short Vowels) (18 words) 
All the class eleven words test the subjects’ pronunciation errors in 
English short vowels /ܼ /e/, /æ/, ܥ ݞ ݜDQG ۑ English has a greater 
number of vowels than Arabic. Therefore, I would predict that some of 
these short vowels would be difficult for Arabic speakers. The class eleven 
words are given in (16):  
(16) heavy, sit, deaf, set, pad, rash, gone, wash, wood, look, rub, hut, 
attempt, about, polite, postman, breakfast, sailor 
Class 12: (Long Vowels) (12 words)  
All the class twelve words test the subjects’ pronunciation errors in 
English long vowels /i:/, /u:/, /ܤ, /୆ and /ܮ. English and Arabic have 
two different vowel structures or patterns. Therefore, I would predict that 
some of these long vowels would be difficult for Arabic speakers. The 
class twelve words are given in (17):  
(17) field, leaf, through, food, boot, cigar, heart, board, cork, fur, word, 
work  
Class 13: (Diphthongs) (16 words)  
 
All the class thirteen words test the subjects’ pronunciation errors in 
English diphthongs /Hܼ /Dܼ /୆ܼ, /ԥݜ/, /ܼۑ /Hۑ and /ݜۑ. Arabic has no 
diphthongs. Therefore, I would predict that some of these diphthongs 
would be difficult for Arabic speakers. The class twelve words are given 
in (18):

(18) raid, fate, bite, ripe, boil, point, grow, stove, crown, mouth, beer,

Class 14: (Easily Confused Vowels) (56 words)  
 
The poor mastery of English vowels is the most noticeable feature in the 
English speech of Arabic speakers. Therefore, English vowels were tested 
twice using different lists of words. 
(14 a): (Short Vowels) (14 words) 
All the class (14 a) words test the subjects’ pronunciation errors in English 
short vowels /ܼ v. /e/, /ݞ v. /ܥ /ܥ v. /୆ /ܥ v. /ݞ and /ݜ v. /ܥ I would 
predict that some of these short vowels would be difficult for Arabic 
speakers. The class (14 a) words are given in (19).  
(19) miss, mess, bitter, better, luck, lock, cot, caught, gone, gun, put, pot, 
look, lock  
(14 b): (Long Vowels) (20 words)  
All the class (14 b) words test the subjects’ pronunciation errors in English 
long vowels /i:/ v. /ܼ/, /ܮ v. /ܤ /ܮ v. /୆, /ܤ v. /ݞ, /୆ v. /ԥݜ/ and /u:/ v. 
ݜ I would predict that some of these long vowels would be difficult for 
Arabic speakers. The class (14 b) words are given in (20):  
(20) sheep, ship, hurt, heart, dirt, dart, worm, warm, word, ward, staff, 
stuff, task, tusk, ball, phone, food, good, fool, stood 
(14 c): (Diphthongs) (22 words)  
All the class (14 c) words test the subjects’ pronunciation errors in English 
long vowels Hܼ v. /e/, Hܼ v. Dܼ Hܼ v. /æ/, Dܼ v. ܼ Hۑ v. ܼۑ Hۑ v. 
/i:/, /ܼۑ v. /ܮand /ԥݜ/ v. /୆. I would predict that some of these diphthongs 
would be difficult for Arabic speakers. The class (14 c) words are given in 
(21):  
(21) sail, sell, vain, vine, pain, pine, hate, hat, fain, fan, fine, fin, bite, bit, 
bear, beer, chair, sheep, beard, bird, boat, bought  
 Class 15: (Intrusive Vowels) (5 words)

would predict that some of these consonant clusters would be difficult for 
Arabic speakers. The class fifteen words are given in (22):  
(22) spring, swing, worked, changed, grandfather  
Class 16: (Vowel Reduction to Schwa) (10 words)   
All the class sixteen words test the subjects’ pronunciation errors in 
reducing the vowels of English function words to schwa ۑ Function 
words in Arabic do not have two forms and unstressed vowels keep their 
full value. Therefore, I would predict that schwa would be difficult for 
Arabic speakers. The class sixteen words are given in (23):  
(23) Here they are, They are coming, Shoot at him, Stop at the next house, 
There is nothing to do,  
What do you see?, What is he waiting for?, He is waiting for pay. Read as 
much as you should, How should I know?. 
Class 17: (Vowel Length) (22 words)  
All the class seventeen words test the subjects’ pronunciation errors in 
vowel length. In Arabic, vowels vary in length regardless of the following 
consonant. Therefore, I would predict that vowel length would be difficult 
for Arabic speakers. The class seventeen words are given in (24):  
(24) cap, cab, seat, seed, dock, dog, leaf, leave, belief, believe, vacation, 
occasion, faith, bathe, tooth, smooth, loose, lose, cease, seize, catch, cadge 
(B) Suprasegmental Errors:  
Word Group III: (Errors in Word Stress) (90 words)  
 
All the Group III words have stress patterns which are different from 
Arabic. Thus, I would predict that Arabic speakers would have difficulty 
with this word group and would apply Arabic stress rules (i.e. L1 negative 
transfer), producing incorrect English main word stress patterns. This 
word group tests both simple and compound main stress and consists of 
eight word classes.  

Chapter Four 
 
134 
- Simple Word Stress (78 words)   
Class 18: (unstressed final V: or VV) (10 words)  
All the class eighteen words end in an unstressed long vowel or diphthong. 
They all have main stress on either the first or second syllable from the 
left. Arabic stress rules require a final CV: to receive main stress. Final 
stress is the unmarked stress pattern for Arabic words ending in a long 
vowel. Therefore, I would predict that these words would be difficult for 
Arabic speakers, if they are transferring their L1 rules. The class eighteen 
words are given in (25):  
(25) 'multiply, 'holiday, 'igloo, 'beautify, i'dentify, 'castaway, 'carboy, 
'cargo, 'whitlow, 'bungalow  
Class 19: (unstressed final –CVVC) (12 words) 
All the class nineteen words end in an unstressed final -CVVC. They all 
have main stress on the first syllable. In Arabic, a final –CV:C receives 
main stress (i.e. unmarked stress pattern). Thus, I would predict that these 
words would be difficult for the Arabic speakers, if they are transferring 
their L1 settings. The class nineteen words are in (26):  
(26) 'prosecute, 'substitute, 'gratitude, 'multitude, 'criticise, 'exercise, 
'demonstrate, 'captivate, 'carbide, 'carmine, 'telegraph, 'telescope 
Class 20: (unstressed final –CVCC) (16 words) 
All the class twenty words end in an unstressed final -CVCC. They all 
have main stress on either the first or second syllable from the left. In 
Arabic, a final –CVCC receives main stress (i.e. unmarked stress pattern). 
Thus, I would predict that these words would be difficult for the Arabic 
speakers, if they are transferring their L1 rules. The class twenty words are 
given in (27).  
(27) 'manifest, 'scientist, 'product, 'punishment, 'applicant, 'difficult, 
'concept, 'evident, 'impact, 'impotent, 'management, ad'vertisement, 
con'versant, a'ppellant, 'specialist, 'occupant  
Class 21: (the CV'CVCV(C) syllabic pattern) (4 words)  
All the class twenty one words have the syllabic pattern CV'CVCV(C) 
with main stress on the penultimate syllable. Three words also end in the 
suffix -ic which draws main stress to the immediately preceding syllable. 

Results 
 
135 
In Arabic, words with the syllabic pattern CVCVCV(C) receive main 
stress on the antepenultimate syllable (i.e. unmarked stress pattern). Thus, 
it would be predicted that Arabic speakers would have difficulty with 
these words and would stress the first syllable. The class twenty one words 
are given in (28).  
(28) pa'cific, te'rrific, de'posit, so'licit 
Class 22: (stressed antepenult) (12 words)  
All the class twenty two words have unstressed heavy penultimate syllable 
and have main stress on the antepenult. It is a characteristic of Arabic that 
a heavy penult receives main stress (i.e. unmarked stress pattern). Thus, I 
would predict that Arabic speakers would have difficulty with these words 
and would wrongly stress the heavy penultimate syllable. The class twenty 
two words are given in (29): 
(29) 'silently, 'messenger, 'orchestra, 'barrister, 'cucumber, 'calendar, 
'currency, 'helicopter, 'cylinder, 'protestant, 'passenger, 'theromstat  
Class 23: (stressed preantepenult) (12 words)  
All the class twenty three words have main stress on the 
preantepenultimate syllable. In Arabic, stress never precedes the 
antepenultimate syllable (i.e. always inside the three syllable window). 
Thus, it would be predicted that Arabic speakers would have difficulty 
with these words and would stress the antepenultimate syllable. The class 
twenty three words are given in (30):  
(30) 'necessary, 'mercenary, 'category, 'demonstrator, 'characterise, 
'speculator, 'legislative, 'imaginary, 'matrimony, 'propagator, 'accuracy, 
'adequacy 
Class 24: (stress contrasts) (12 words)  
 
All the class twenty four words show that English main word stress can be 
used in a contrastive way. In English, some pairs of two-syllable words 
with identical spelling can be used as either a noun or a verb. Nouns are 
stressed on the first syllable, whereas verbs on the second. Arabic rarely 
uses contrastive stress (i.e. marked stress pattern), and instead uses word 
order to show strong contrast. Thus, I would predict that Arabic speakers 
would have difficulty with these words and would wrongly stress them 
either as nouns or as verbs. The class twenty four words are given in (31):  

Chapter Four 
 
136 
(31) we pro'test, our 'protest, we ob'ject, our 'object, we pre'sent, our 
'present, to ex'port, our 'export, to pe'rmit, a 'permit, to pro'gress, our 
'progress  
Class 25: (compound stress) (12 words)  
 
All the class twenty five words are compounds with main stress on their 
first element. Arabic has at least two main stress patterns of compounds: 
compounds with main stress on the first element and compounds with two 
main stresses one placed on each element. In Arabic compounds with main 
stress on their first element are marked. Thus, I would predict that Arabic 
speakers would have difficulty with these English compounds and would 
either place two main stresses on both elements of the compound or one 
main stress on the second element. The class twenty five words are given 
in (32):  
(32) 'apple tree, 'flowerpot, 'blacksmith, 'greengrocer, 'birthday, 'sheepdog, 
'greenhouse, 'midnight, 'make-up, 'setback, 'workshop, 'classroom 
4.1.2 Description of a Picture 
The second part of the test, which reflects Arabs’ errors in English sounds 
and main word stress rules while describing a picture, consisted of one 
page of stimulus large picture to be described by all the subjects.  
 
4.1.3 The Subjects 
The subjects of the study were 45 adult Arabic speakers (40 males and 5 
females): fifteen Egyptians, fifteen Saudi Arabians and fifteen Libyans. 
All the subjects are native speakers of Arabic and speak L2 English. Their 
ages range between 27 and 40 years. The subjects had studied L2 English 
for a range of 6 to 8 years. Particular care was taken to ensure that all the 
subjects were native Arabic speakers. 
4.2 Results 
The presentation of the results is divided into two sections. The first 
section deals with the subjects’ errors in English sounds and main word 
stress in the lists of words. The second section includes their segmental 
and suprasegmental errors while describing the picture which reflects their 
naturally occurring English Language. The subjects’ results while reading

the lists of words were as shown in the results in this chapter. The 
subjects’ errors are now presented.  
4.2.1 Results of the Production Test 
The results of the subjects’ errors in English consonant and vowel sounds 
and main word stress are presented in the following order: (a) the subjects’ 
overall performance in each word group (b) the results of each word class 
in each word group and the reasons behind the errorsand (c) summary of 
the subjects’ overall error patterns in each word group. 
 
4.2.2 Sound and Stress Error Totals 
The subjects had to perform a production test by reading aloud a list of 
words into a tape recorder. There was no training session. Let us now turn 
to look at the subjects’ performance in more detail. Table 2 presents a 
breakdown of the sound and stress errors that the subjects made by class. 
Here the numbers indicate the number of subjects who made a sound or 
stress error on a particular item.

4.2.4 Ranking of Sound and Stress Errors Patterns 
Table 3 indicates which classes of words caused greater difficulty for the 
subjects. The higher the score, the greater the number of errors for a 
particular class. The percentage of errors is calculated by dividing the total 
number of tokens by the number of errors.

The subjects’ total number and percentage of errors in pronouncing 
English consonants in Word Group I, by word class show the following. 
First, the subjects found different degrees of difficulty in producing 
English consonants. Second, the subjects’ performance is best in 
pronouncing English semi-vowels (2.22%) and worst in pronouncing 
English affricates (41.94%) and words testing the English letter sound 
mismatch (41.21%). Third, the subjects’ production of English consonants 
confirms this research hypothesis that the subjects substitute their own 
Arabic sounds (i.e. L1 negative transfer) for the unfamiliar English ones, 
producing incorrect English sounds.  
4.3.1.2 Errors in Vowels 
 
4.3.1.2.1 Class 1: Plosives 
Many subjects produced the initial English voiceless, plosive /p/ as /b/ or 
unaspirated. They pronounced ‘pin’ /phܼQ/ as EܼQ or /pܼn/. But they found 
no difficulty in pronouncing the sound /p/ followed by /t/ as in ‘wept’ 
/wept/. In addition, in connected speech while describing the picture, they 
used /p/ and /b/ randomly (i.e. L1 negative transfer and hypercorrection): * 
In this bicture some beople are brobably blaying in some blace on the 
peach. 
Although the sounds /t/ and /d/ differ in their places of articulation: 
alveolar in English but dental in Arabic, they constituted no difficulty for 
the subjects except for some Libyans who pronounced final /d/ as /t/ as in 
‘hard’ */hܤt/. The sounds /k/ and /g/ did not pose any problems for the 
subjects, except when /k/ is spelled ‘ch’ as in ‘monarch’. The subjects’ 
errors in English plosives are shown in Table 4.

In the light of the foregoing comparison between English and Arabic 
consonants in Chapter 3, the following explanation of the subjects’ 
erroneous pronunciation in English plosives is given as follows: 
/p/ and /b/  The sound /p/ posed a problem for the subjects, because it 
does not occur in Modern Standard Arabic (MSA). As a result, the 
subjects substituted their MSA /b/ for English /p/ due to L1 negative 
transfer or pronounced English initial /p/ unaspirated. Aspiration is the 
little puff of air that sometimes follows a speech sound. It does not 
occur in all English sounds: only voiceless stops and the affricate ݹ 
exhibit aspiration word-initially (Hammond, 1999). 
/k/  Many subjects pronounced the word ‘monarch’ PܥQԥk/ as PܥQԥݕ/ 
by mispronouncing the voiceless plosive /k/ as ݕ, since they 
overgeneralised the same pronunciation in words such as ‘machine’, 
‘brochure’ and ‘chef’. These subjects are not aware that the consonant 
digraph (ch) has three different sounds /k/ ‘school’, ݕ ‘machinery’ and 
ݹ ‘choose’, the most common of which is the ݹ as in ‘chimney’ and 
‘much’. The ‘ch’ words with the /k/ sound are derived from classical 
Greek, and the word ‘monarch’ comes from the Greek language. This 
is also because Arabic spelling is virtually phonetic (Smith, 1987), and 
Arabs, therefore, tend to pronounce English words phonetically. 
Several writers have expressed their views on Arabs’ errors in English 
plosives. Kenworthy (1987) and Baker (1982) mention that Arabs tend to 
produce English /p/ unaspirated which to English ears sounds like /b/. 
Furthermore, O’Connor (1967) states that Arabs confuse /p/ and /b/, /b/ 
being used for both. Regarding /d/, Baker (1982) states that some Arab 
learners tend to pronounce final /d/ as /t/. Finally, Smith (1987) mentions 
that /g/ and /k/ are often confused, especially by those Arabs whose 
dialects do not include the phoneme /g/. The findings in Table 1 support 
the views of Kenworthy (1987) and Baker (1982) regarding initial 
unaspirated /p/. Regarding final /d/, only five Libyans pronounced it as /t/ 
in slight support of Baker (1982). Finally, none of the subjects confused 
/g/ with /k/ which contradicts the view of Smith (1987).  
4.3.1.2.2 Class 2: Fricatives 
Some subjects pronounced the sound ș as /s/ (Egyptians) or /t/ or as two 
separate sounds /t/ + /h/ (Libyans). Regarding șV and /ðz/, some subjects 
inserted a vowel between the two elements as in */bܤșܼs/ for ‘baths’ and 
*/smu:ðܼz/ for ‘smoothes’. Furthermore, many subjects found it difficult to 
pronounce ‘th’ when it changes from /ș to /ð/ in words like ‘north’ /n୆ș 
‘northern’ /n୆ðԥn/ and ‘northerly’ /n୆ðԥlܼ/ as shown in Table 5.

The explanation of the subjects’ errors in English fricatives is given as 
follows: 
/݇/ and /ð/   Although the sounds /݇/ and /ð/ exist in Modern Standard 
Arabic, Egyptians replace them with Arabic /s/ and /z/ in their spoken 
Arabic. Some subjects, therefore, pronounced English /݇/ and /ð/ as /s/ 
and /z/ respectively (Egyptians) or as two separate sounds /t/ + /h/ 
(Libyans). In addition, both /݇/ and /ð/ have two separate letters in 
Arabic which made it difficult for the subjects to know when they 
should pronounce English ‘th’ as /݇/ or /ð/. Moreover, in English, the 
pronunciation of ‘th’ can be changed from /݇/ in the root to /ð/ in the 
derivations as in ‘south’, ‘southern’ and ‘southerly’. In Arabic, /݇/ or 
/ð/ are the same both in the root and derivations as in /ma݇݇al/ ‘he 
acted’, /muma݇݇il/ ‘actor’, /tilmi:ð/ ‘a pupil’ and /talami:ð/ ‘pupils’. As 
a result, the subjects found difficulty in changing the pronunciation of 
‘th’ from /݇/ to /ð/ in English words.  
/v/ 
The voiced fricative sound /v/ presented a problem to the 
subjects, because it does not occur in Modern Standard Arabic but only 
in borrowed words such as /vi:za/ ‘visa’ and /tilivizyo:n/ ‘television’. 
As a consequence, the subjects pronounced English /v/ as /f/. 
/ݤ/ 
This sound does not occur in Modern Standard Arabic but only in 
borrowed words and in names of foreign origins such as /ݤiba/ ‘skirt’ 
and /ݤo:rݤ/ ‘George’. Consequently, some subjects pronounced English 
/ݤ/ as /g/ or /ݕ/.  
According to O’Connor (1967) and Smith (1987), Arabs tend to 
pronounce /v/ as /f/. But Baker (1982) mentions that Arabs pronounce /v/ 
as /f/ or /b/. Regarding /݇/ and /ð/, Kenworthy (1987) states that most 
Arabs substitute /s/ and /z/ for /݇/ and /ð/ respectively. Some writers such 
as Baker (1982) state that Arabs confuse /݇/ with /s/ or /t/ and /ð/ with /z/ 
or /d/. Finally, O’Connor (1967) and Baker (1982) state that Arabs 
pronounce /ݤ/ as /ݕ/ or /z/. 
In Table 5, although three subjects pronounced /v/ as /f/, this error was not 
as common as O’Connor (1967), Smith (1987) and Baker (1982) 
considered it to be. In addition, none of the subjects pronounced /v/ as /b/ 
which contradicts Baker (1982). Regarding /݇/ and /ð/, only two Egyptians 
pronounced them as /s/ and /z/ respectively which does not support 
Kenworthy (1987) and Baker (1982). Six Libyans pronounced /݇/ as /t/ 
which slightly supports Baker (1982), but none of the subjects pronounced 

Chapter Four 
 
152 
/ð/ as /d/ which conflicts with Baker (1982). Unlike the previous studies, 
this research finds that two Libyans pronounced/݇/ as two separate sounds 
/t/ + /h/, and twenty two subjects pronounced /ð/ as /݇/. Furthermore, thirty 
six subjects did not change the pronunciation of ‘th’ from /݇/ to /ð/ in 
words such as ‘south’ and ‘southern’. The results also show that some 
subjects confused /ݤ/ with /ݕ/ which supports O’Connor (1967). 
4.3.1.2. 3 Class 3: Affricates

The explanation of the subjects’ erroneous pronunciation is given as 
follows: 
/ݹ/ 
This sound occurs in English as a distinct phoneme but as a 
sequence of /t/ + /ݕ/ in MSA. The subjects, therefore, pronounced it as 
/ݕ/ or /k/. In addition, many subjects mispronounced the /ݹ/ in ‘cello’ as 
/s/, since Arabic is virtually phonetic: there is one to one 
correspondence between English letters andsounds. Therefore, Arabs 
tend to pronounce English words phonetically. 
 
/ݶ/ This sound occurs in Standard Arabic but not in all dialects. In 
addition, /ݶ/ can be represented by different letters in English, such as 
‘j’, ‘dg’, ‘g’ and ‘ge’. As a result, the subjects pronounced English /ݶ/ 
as /g/, /d/ or as two separate sounds /d/ + /ݤ/.

Kenworthy (1987) mentions that it may not be difficult for Arabs to 
achieve the sound /ݹ/, whereas Baker (1982) states that Arabs pronounce 
/ݹ/ as /ݕ/. Regarding /ݶ/, Kenworthy (1987) states that Arabs confuse /ݶ/ 
with /ݤ / or /ݹ/. Table 6 shows that twenty four subjects pronounced /ݹ/ as 
/ݕ/ which supports Baker (1982). In addition, twenty two subjects 
pronounced /ݹ/ as /k/. This does not support the view of Kenworthy 
(1987).Regarding /ݶ/, two subjects pronounced /ݶ/ as two separate letters 
/d/ + /ݤ/ and sixteen subjects as /g/. This does not support Kenworthy 
(1987). 
4.3.1.2.4 Class 4: Nasals 
The subjects found no difficulty in pronouncing the sounds /m/ and /n/. 
But they had a problem with the sound ƾ as they pronounced it as two 
separate phonemes /n/ + /g/ or /n/ + /k/ as in ‘sing’ */sܼng/ and ‘thing’ 
șܼnk/ respectively. In addition, no problem was found in pronouncing the 
sound ƾ followed by the sound /k/ as in ‘bank’ E ƾN as shown in Table

The explanation of the subjects’ erroneous pronunciation is given as 
follows: 
/ƾ/ 
The sound /ƾ/ does not occur independently in Arabic but can 
exist as an allophone of /n/ before a velar /k/ or /g/. The subjects, 
therefore, found no difficulty in pronouncing English words such as 
‘longer’ /lܥƾgۑr/ and ‘thank’ /݇ ƾk/. Furthermore, when English /ƾ/ 
occurred after a vowel or word-finally, they pronounced it as two 
separate phonemes /n/ + /g/ as in ‘thing’ */ܼ݇ng/ and ‘singing’ 
*/sܼngܼng/. 
 

Chapter Four 
 
154 
According to Kenworthy (1987), Arabs tend to pronounce the /g/ in ‘sing’ 
as a separate sound instead of /ƾ/. Smith (1987) mentions that Arabs 
usually pronounce /ƾ/ as /n/, /ng/ or /nk/, whereas O’Connor (1967) and 
Baker (1982) state that Arabs tend to replace /ƾ/ by /ƾk/ or /ƾg/. Thirty 
subjects pronounced /ƾ/ as /ng/ and three subjects as /nk/ which supports 
the views of Kenworthy (1987) and Smith (1987). But it does not agree 
with Smith (1987) that Arabs pronounce /ƾ/ as /n/ and O’Connor (1967) 
and Baker (1982) that Arabs pronounce /ƾ/ as /ƾk/ or /ƾg/. 
4.3.1.2.5 Class 5: Laterals 
Some subjects strongly trilled the English sound /r/ and most of them 
pronounced the RP /r/ where it should be silent as in ‘four girls’ */fܧ:r 
gܮ:rlz/. Moreover, the English sound dark á posed a problem for the Arab 
subjects. As a result, they commonly used their clear /l/ in English words 
like ‘old’ and ‘ball’ as shown in Table 8.

The explanation of the subjects’ erroneous pronunciation is given as 
follows: 
/r/ 
Some subjects strongly trilled English /r/. This is because English 
has only one /r/ which is a post-alveolar fricative, whereas Arabic has 
two r-phonemes which are either an alveolar flap or an alveolar trill. 
The trill /r/ is characterised by a rapid succession of taps by the tip of 
the tongue on the alveolar ridge. In addition, the subjects pronounced 
the English /r/ where it should be silent as in ‘far from’ and ‘teacher’. 
This is because Arabic /r/ is pronounced before consonants and word 
finally, whereas RP /r/ is pronounced only when followed by a vowel. 
/l/ 
Some subjects used their clear /l/ in all English words. This is 
because Arabic has two lateral /l/ phonemes: dark /L/ which occurs 
only contiguous to /T, D, S, ଼, r, L/ as in /ToLLa:b/ ‘students’ and in 

Results 
 
155 
/௧aLLa:h/ ‘God’ and clear /l/ which occurs in all other positions as in 
/qalam/ ‘pen’. English has one lateral /l/ phoneme with two allophones: 
dark /ܽ/ which occurs post-vocalically as in ‘field’ and ‘well’ and clear 
/l/ which occurs pre-vocalically as in ‘leaf’. 
O’Connor (1967) states that /l/ occurs in both its clear and dark forms in 
Arabic, but they are distributed differently and Arabs may sometimes 
interchange them in English. Regarding /r/, Baker (1982) says that Arabs 
strongly trill the English /r/ and pronounce it where normally silent. The 
findings in Table 8 support Baker (1982) as five subjects strongly trilled 
the English /r/ and forty three subjects pronounced /r/ where it should be 
silent. Regarding /l/, forty subjects pronounced dark /ܽ/ as clear /l/ which 
partially supports O’Connor (1967). 
4.3.1.2.6 Class 6: Semi-vowels 
The English semi-vowels /j/ and /w/ constituted no difficulty for the 
subjects except for /w/ followed by /h/ as in ‘whale’ which they 
pronounced as */hweܼl/ as in Table 9.

The explanation of the subjects’ erroneous pronunciation is given as 
follows: 
According to Smith (1987), Arabic spelling is simple and virtually 
phonetic: a sound is represented by a letter. Arabs tend, therefore, to 
pronounce English words phonetically. In addition, they tend to misread 
letters within words by making right to left eye movements, e.g. ‘form’ for 
‘from’. Forty subjects pronounced ‘hiccough’ /hܼNݞp/ as */hܼkݞf/ and thirty 
nine subjects pronounced ‘cognac’ /kܥnjæk/ as */kܥgnæk/. Six subjects 
also pronounced ‘when’ as */hwen/. This supports Smith (1987).

The explanation of the subjects’ erroneous pronunciation is given as 
follows: 
The subjects pronounced English words phonetically. This is because the 
spelling of Arabic is simple and phonetic and adheres very much to the 
convention ‘one sound – one letter’. English spelling is an unreliable guide 
to the pronunciation as is clear in the following points: 
• Different letters may represent a single sound: 
 
all  warm  chalk  autumn 
draw  
• A single letter may represent different sounds: 
 
hate  fall  village  many 
• A combination of letters may represent a single sound: 
Sheep  character  photo deal 
• Some letters have no sound in certain words: 
  
wheel climb island corps 
• Some sounds are not represented in the spelling: 
  
suite  soldier  lieutenant    hiccough  
 
Smith (1987) mentions that among the features of Arabic which give rise 
to an ‘Arabic accent’ in English is a general reluctance to omit consonants 
once the written form is known, e.g. */kleܼmbܼd/ for ‘climbed’. Thirty one 
subjects pronounced ‘psalm’ /sܤ:m/ as */psܤ:lm/ and forty one subjects 
pronounced ‘corps’ /kܧ:/ as */k୆:ps/. This confirms the view of Smith 
(1987). 
4.3.1.2.7.3 Class 7 c: Consonant Doubling 
The subjects doubled the pronunciation of English double consonants 
especially in written texts. But they had no problem with words such as 
‘midday’ or ’dissatisfied’ which should be doubled in English as shown in 
Table 12.

The explanation of the subjects’ erroneous pronunciation is given as 
follows: 
Many subjects doubled the pronunciation of English double consonants. 
This is because in Arabic, the ‘pronunciation’ of consonants is often 
doubled to affect a change in meaning.This doubling is affected by 
lengthening the consonant (i.e. gemination) rather than trying to 
pronounce it twice as in /kut-tab/ ‘Quran school’, /ݧal-lama/ ‘he taught’, 
/muma݇-݇il/‘actor’ and /mudar-ris/ ‘teacher’.  
It is a feature of English to have much ‘orthographic’ doubling of 
consonants as in ‘matter’ and ‘correct’. But these tend to be pronounced as 
a single consonant sound as in ‘matter’ /mætۑ/ and ‘correct’ /kۑrekt/. 
Kharma and Hajjaj (1997) state that although English has much 
orthographic doubling of consonants, these tend to be pronounced as a 
single consonant, e.g. /ܼmbærۑs/ ‘embarrass’. But Arabs tend to double the 
pronunciation of English double consonants. Twenty six subjects 
pronounced 
‘stubborn’ 
/VWݞEԥn/ 
as 
*/stܥb-b୆:n/ 
and 
thirty 
six 
subjectspronounced ‘collect’ Nԥlekt/ as */kܥl-lekt/. This substantiates the 
views of Kharma and Hajjaj (1997). 
4.3.1.2.7.4 Class 7 d: Syllabic Consonants 
Many subjects found difficulty in pronouncing syllabic consonants (i.e. 
consonants which constitute syllables by themselves) in such words as 
‘little’ and ‘rhythm’. As a result, they used an intrusive vowel as shown in 
Table 13.

In English, certain types of consonant sounds (/l, m, n, r, ƾ/) can form 
syllables on their own. In contrast, Arabic makes no use of syllabic 
consonants. The subjects, therefore, used an intrusive vowel before 
English syllabic consonants as follows: */mܼdܼl/ for /mܼdশ/ ‘middle’ and 
*/݇reten/ for /݇ret৆/ ‘threaten’.  
According to Kharma and Hajjaj (1997), English makes much use of /l/, 
/m/ and /n/ as syllabic consonants. Arabs tend to use an intrusive vowel 
here: /'bܥtশ/ bottle becomes */'bܥtܼl/. Twenty seven subjects pronounced 
‘middle’ /PܼGOࡦ/ as */mܼdܼl/ and thirty six subjects pronounced ‘button’ 
/bݞtQࡦ/ as */bݞtܥn/. This supports the views of Kharma and Hajjaj (1997). 
4.3.1.3 Errors in Consonant Clusters 
4.3.1.3.1 Class 8: Initial Consonant Clusters 
The subjects had little difficulty with initial two-element consonant 
clusters. They had trouble only with clusters beginning with the sounds 
/p/, /s/, /g/, ș consonant + /j/ and the consonant cluster /dw/. 
Furthermore, all three-element consonant clusters presented a problem to 
the subjects. As a result, they inserted either a short vowel or a glottal stop 
and a short vowel before any consonant cluster beginning with the sound 
/s/ as shown in Table 14.

According to the comparison between English and Arabic consonant 
clusters in Chapter 3 the reasons for the subjects’ errors can be as follows: 
1) English permits much longer initial, medial and final consonant 
clusters than Arabic. As a result, the subjects found difficulty in 
pronouncing English consonant sequences. 
2) Initial two-element clusters: 
  
Many subjects had trouble with clusters beginning with /p/, /s/, /g/, 
/݇/ and consonant + /j/. The subjects substituted their native /b/ for 
/p/ and /s/ for /݇/, since /p/ does not occur in Arabic and Egyptians 
pronounce Arabic /݇/ as /s/. In addition, Arabic spelling is virtually 
phonetic, the subjects, therefore, did not pronounce the sound /j/ in 
words like ‘pure’ and ‘lewd’. As consonant clusters occur in Arabic 
mainly word medially or finally, the subjects inserted /ܼ/ or /௧ܼ/ 
before clusters with /s/ or /g/ to move them away from the initial 
position. This is common in Arabic words such as /௧istamar/ ‘he 
continued’ and /௧is௧al/ ‘ask’. The differences between syllable 
structures of the first language (L1) and the second language (L2) 
can be sources of L2 errors and lead to syllable repair strategies 
which bring the L2 syllable structure into conformity with the L1.  
3)  Initial three-element clusters: 
 
Since initial three-element clusters do not occur in Arabic, they 
constituted great difficulty to the subjects. Consequently, many 
subjects inserted /ܼ/ or /௧ܼ/ before clusters beginning with /s/.  
 
According to O’Connor (1967) sequences of three or more consonants do 
not occur in many forms of Arabic. In addition, Smith (1987) mentions 
that the range of consonant clusters occurring in English is much wider 
than in Arabic. Initial two-segment clusters not occurring in Arabic 
include: pr, pl, gr, gl, thr, thw, sp. The range of final clusters is also much 
smaller in Arabic. Of the 78 three-segment clusters and 14 four-segment 
clusters occurring finally in English, none occur in Arabic. In all the above 
cases, Arabs tend to insert short vowels to ‘assist’ pronunciation. 
Twenty four subjects pronounced ‘plane’ as */bleܼn/, ten subjects with 
unaspirated /p/ and thirty three subjects inserted a short vowel before 
‘swing’. In addition, twenty seven subjects inserted a short vowel before 
‘great’. This supports Smith (1987) regarding Arabs’ difficulties with 
initial two-element clusters beginning with /p/, /g/ and /s/. Unlike Smith 
(1987), this research found the following: some Arabs also inserted a 
glottal stop and a short vowel /௧ܼ/ before words beginning with /g/ and /s/ 
but not before /݇/, some Arabs pronounced /݇/ as /s/ or /t/ (Libyans) and

some Arabs also had problems with the clusters ‘consonant + /j/’ and /dw/.  
4.3.1.3.2 Class 9: Medial Consonant Clusters 
English medial consonant clusters of more than two consonants posed 
great difficulty to the subjects. As a consequence, they broke the 
consonant cluster by inserting a short vowel between the second and third 
consonants as shown in Table 15.

The explanation of the subjects’ erroneous pronunciation is given as 
follows: 
Since Arabic does not permit more than two consonants word-medially, 
English medial sequences of three or four consonants presented a great 
difficulty to the subjects. In addition, Arabic permits only two consonants 
in close transition: /CC/ /katabat kitab/ ‘she wrote a book’ and to avoid a 
sequence of more than two consonants, a short (epenthetic) vowel occurs 
between the second and third consonants: /CC-i-C/ /baݴdi ma na:m/ ‘after 

Chapter Four 
 
164 
he has slept’, /fi'himti dars/ ‘I understood a lesson’ and /'binti ?uxti/ ‘my 
sister’s daughter’. As a result, they transferred their native habit of 
inserting a short vowel between the second and third consonant when 
pronouncing these clusters within words and in connected speech. This 
substantiates the view of O’Connor (1967). 
4.3.1.3.3 Class 10: Final Consonant Clusters 
4.3.1.3.3.1 Class 10 a: Two-element Clusters 
The subjects encountered some difficulty with final two-element 
consonant clusters. They, therefore, inserted a vowel between the two 
elements to break the consonant cluster, substituted one sound for another 
or occasionally both together as shown in Table 16.

Although Arabic permits two consonants word-finally, this kind of 
English cluster presented some difficulty to the subjects. They, therefore, 
inserted a short vowel between the two elements. Unlike the previous 
studies, Table 16 reveals that the Arab subjects found varying degrees of 
difficulty with final two-element clusters.  
4.3.1.3.3.2 Class 10 b: Three-element Clusters 
All three-element consonant clusters occurring word-finally presented 
great difficulty to the subjects. They inserted a short vowel between the 
last two consonants as in Table 17.

Many Arab subjects inserted a short vowel between the last two 
consonants to assist the pronunciation of final three-element clusters. This 
supports the view of O’Connor (1967) and Smith (1987).  
4.3.1.3.3.3 Class 10 c: Four-element clusters 
The subjects found great difficulty with final four-element consonant 
clusters. As a result, they had a tendency to insert a short vowel either 
between the first and second consonants or between the second and the 
third as in Table 18.

The explanation of the subjects’ erroneous pronunciation is given as 
follows: 
The subjects encountered great difficulty in pronouncing them, since final 
three and four element clusters do not occur in Arabic. They, therefore, 
broke the cluster by inserting a short vowel especially between the second 
and third consonants. This substantiates the views of O’Connor (1967) and 
Smith (1987). 
4.3.1.4 Summary of the Subjects’ Overall Consonant Error Patterns: 
Word Group I 
The results in Word Group I reveal that many subjects have not yet 
mastered English consonants. The summary of the subjects’ overall 
consonant error patterns in this word group is now shown.  
Word Group I: Consonants (319 words)  
Result: Arabic speakers had difficulty with some English consonants and 
substituted their own Arabic consonant sounds for the unfamiliar English 
ones (i.e. L1 negative transfer), producing incorrect English consonants.  
- Class 1: (Plosives) (20 words)  
Result: The English voiceless plosive /p/ was difficult for Arabic speakers 
and was pronounced as /b/ or unaspirated /p/. 
- Class 2: (Fricatives) (39 words)  
Result: The English fricative sounds ș /ð/, /v/ and ݤ were difficult for 
Arabic speakers and were pronounced as /s/, /z/, /f/ and /g/ respectively.  

Chapter Four 
 
168 
- Class 3: (Affricates) (8 words)  
Result: The English affricate sounds ݹ and ݶ were difficult for Arabic 
speakers and were pronounced as ݕ and /g/ respectively.  
- Class 4: (Nasals) (12 words)  
Result: The English nasal sound /ƾ/ was difficult for Arabic speakers and 
was pronounced as /ng/. 
- Class 5: (Laterals) (15 words)  
Result: The English lateral sounds /r/ and /l/ were not very difficult for 
Arabic speakers. 
- Class 6: (Semi-vowels) (6 words) 
Result: The English semi-vowels /j/ and /w/ were not very difficult for 
Arabic speakers.  
- Class 7: Orthography and Pronunciation  
- (7 a) (Letter Sound Mismatch) (11 words) 
Result: These English words were difficult for Arabic speakers, since 
there is a mismatch between English orthography and pronunciation, 
whereas Arabic spelling is simple and virtually phonetic.  
 - (7 b) (Silent Letters) (24 words) 
Result: These English words were difficult for Arabic speakers, since 
there is a match between Arabic orthography and pronunciation, and a 
single letter represents a single sound. 
- (7 c) (Consonant Doubling) (22 words) 
Result: These English words were difficult for Arabic speakers, since 
gemination is common in Arabic.  
- (7 d) (Syllabic Consonants) (16 words) 
Result: These English words were difficult for Arabic speakers, since 
Arabic makes no use of syllabic consonants.

Errors in Consonant Clusters (146 words)  
 
 
 
- Class 8: (Initial Consonant Clusters) (44 words)   
Result: These English initial consonant clusters were difficult for Arabic 
speakers, since English permits much longer initial consonant clusters than 
Arabic and initial three-element clusters do not occur in Arabic.  
- Class 9: (Medial Consonant Clusters) (11 words)   
Result: These English medial consonant clusters were difficult for Arabic 
speakers, since Arabic does not permit more than two consonants word-
medially. 
- Class 10: (Final Consonant Clusters) (91 words)  
- (10 a) (Clusters of two consonants) (52 words): 
Result: Arabic speakers found varying degrees of difficulty with final two 
consonant clusters, since Arabic permits some two consonant clusters 
word-finally. 
- (10 b) (Clusters of three consonants) (34 words)  
Result: These English final three consonant clusters were difficult for 
Arabic speakers, since Arabic does not permit three-element consonant 
clusters word finally.  
- (10 c) (Clusters of four consonants) (5 words)  
Result: These English final four consonant clusters were difficult for 
Arabic speakers, since Arabic does not permit four-element consonant 
clusters word finally.

The subjects’ total number and percentage of errors in pronouncing 
English vowels in Word Group II, by word class show the following. First, 
the subjects found different degrees of difficulty in producing English 
vowels. Second, the subjects’ performance is best in pronouncing English 
short vowels (9.38%) and worst in using intrusive vowels to break 
consonant clusters as a syllable repair strategy (28%). Third, the subjects’ 
production of English vowels confirms this research hypothesis that the 
subjects substitute their own Arabic sounds (i.e. L1 negative transfer) for 
the unfamiliar English ones, producing incorrect English sounds.  
4.3.1.6 Errors in Vowels 
4.3.1.6.1 Class 11: Short Vowels 
The subjects confused most of the short vowels with each other, for 
example, /ܼ/ with /e/, /æ/ with /ܤ:/, /ݜ/ with /ܥ/ etc. In addition, they 
replaced ԥ which occurs only in unstressed positions in English, with /a/ 
as in ‘sailor’ */seܼla/ as shown in Table 20.

It is noticeable that the subjects have poor mastery of English short 
vowels, since in Arabic it is the consonants and long vowels which give 
meaning. English has a greater number of short vowels (7) than Arabic 
(3); hence some of these English short vowels do not occur in Arabic. In 
addition, each English short vowel can be represented by different letters 
which is very confusing to the Arab subjects and lead to errors. For 
example, /ܼ/ can be represented by ‘i’, ‘y’, ‘e’, ‘ie’ and ‘a’, /ݞ by ‘u’, ‘o’, 
‘ou’, oo’ and ‘oe’ and /ܥ/ by ‘o’, ‘a’, ‘ou’, ‘ow’ and ‘au’. Therefore, some 
subjects substituted their own Arabic short vowel sounds for the 
unfamiliar English ones (i.e. L1 negative transfer). Arabic is also phonetic 
and some subjects pronounced some words like ‘deaf’, ‘wood’ and ‘look’ 
in a phonetic way. They considered the letters ‘ea’ and ‘oo’ to correspond 
to the vowel sounds /i:/ and /u:/ respectively. 
 Several writers such as O’Connor (1967) mention that Arabs confuse /ܼ/ 
with /e/. In addition, Kenworthy (1987) and Baker (1982) state that Arab 
learners also confuse /æ/ with /ݞ/ and /ܤ:/. The Arab subjects confused /ܼ/ 
with /e/ and /æ/ with /ܤ:/. This confirms the views of O’Connor (1967), 
Kenworthy (1987) and Baker (1982). Unlike the previous studies, this 
research found that some Arab subjects mispronounced /ܼ/ as /aܼ/ or /i:/, /e/ 
as /i:/, /æ/ as /eܼ/ or /e/, /ܥ/ as /ݞ/, /ݜ/ as /ܥ/ or /u:/, /ݞ/ as /ܥ/ or /ݜ/ and /ۑ/ as 
/a/.  
4.3.1.6.2 Class 12: Long Vowels 
The subjects found some difficulty in pronouncing English long vowels. 
They confused /i:/ with /ܼ/, /u:/ with /୆/ and /ɡ:/ with /୆/ or Arabic /e:/ as

English and Arabic has the same number of long vowels. However, each 
English long vowel can be represented by different letters which is very 
confusing to the Arab subjects and lead to errors. For example, /i:/ can be 
represented by ‘ie’, ‘ei’, ‘ey’, ‘ee’, ‘ea’ and ‘e’, / and /୆ by ‘or’, ‘aw’, 
‘ou’, ‘au’, ‘a’ and ‘ore’ and /u:/ by ‘oo’, ‘o’, ‘ou’, ‘u’ and ‘ew’, hence 
some of these English short vowels do not occur in Arabic. Therefore, 
some subjects substituted their own Arabic short vowel sounds for the 
unfamiliar English ones. Arabic is also phonetic and some subjects 
pronounced some words like ‘deaf’, ‘wood’ and ‘look’ in a phonetic way. 
They considered the letters ‘ea’ and ‘oo’ to correspond to the vowel 
sounds /i:/ and /u:/ respectively. 
Smith (1987) says that Arabs confuse /ܥ/ with /୆:/. O’Connor (1967) also 
mentions that Arabs do not always make /ܤ:/ long and therefore confuse it 
with /ݞ/ or /ܥ/. Furthermore, he says that they replace /ܮ:/ by /ݞ/ or /e/ 
followed by Arabic /r/. Some Arab subjects confused /୆:/ with /ܥ/. This 
agrees with Smith (1987). Unlike the previous studies, this research found 
that some subjects mispronounced /i:/ as /ܼ/ or /e/, /u:/ as /୆:/, /ݜ/ or /ݜۑ/, 
/ܤ:/ as /ܮ:/ or /ۑ/ and /ܮ:/ as /୆:/ or Arabic /e:/. This does not agree with 
O’Connor (1967).  
4.3.1.6.3 Class 13: Diphthongs 
Some English diphthongs presented problems to the subjects. As a result, 
they confused /eܼ/ with /æ/ or Arabic /e:/, /ԥݜ/ with /୆/ or Arabic /o:/, /eԥ 
with /ܼԥ or Arabic /e:/ and /ݜԥ with Arabic /u:/. But they found no

The explanation of the subjects’ erroneous pronunciation is given as 
follows: 
English has eight diphthongs, whereas Arabic has none. Therefore, some 
Arab subjects found difficulty in pronouncing English diphthongs. In 
addition, each English diphthong can be represented by different letters 
which is very confusing to the Arab subjects and lead to errors. For 
example, /Hܼ/ can be represented by ‘a’, ‘ai’, ‘ay’, ‘ei’, ‘ey’ and ‘ea’, /Dܼ by 
‘i’, ’y’, ‘igh’, eigh’, ‘ie’, ‘ye’, ‘ei’ and ‘ai’ and µԥݜ’ by ‘o’, ‘oo’, oe’, ‘ou’ 
and ‘ow’. The subjects found no difficulty with /ܧܼ and /aݜ/ as iArabic has 
no diphthongs but it has similar phonetic combinations which consist of a 
vowel + a consonant such as /ay/ as in /kay/ ‘in order to’ and /say-ya:ra/ 
‘car’ and /aw/ as in /௧aw/ ‘or’ and /௧awla:d/ ‘boys’. In addition, the main 
difference between Arabic long vowels and English diphthongs is that the 
former are long without any glide and the latter need the glide to be 
pronounced correctly. The subjects, therefore, pronounced some English 
diphthongs without glide. 
Some writers, such as Kenworthy (1987), state that Arabs find the 
‘caught/coat’ contrast extremely troublesome (/୆:/ vs. /ۑݜ/). Arabs, 
therefore, tend to use their Arabic /o/ sound for both. She also says that 

Chapter Four 
 
174 
Arabic has no diphthongs, but these seem rarely to cause problems. But 
Smith (1987) and Baker (1982) mention that Arab learners confuse /eܼ/ 
with /e/ or /aܼ/ and /ۑݜ/ with /ܥ/, /୆:/ or /ܮ:/. Furthermore, Baker (1982) 
states that Arabs confuse /eۑ/ with /i:/. The results in Table 22 support the 
views of Smith (1987) and Baker (1982) that Arabs confuse /eܼ/ with /aܼ/. 
In addition, they also agree with the previous authors and Kenworthy 
(1987) that Arabs confuse /ۑݜ/ with /୆:/. Unlike the previous studies, this 
research found that some Arab subjects pronounced /eܼ/ as /æ/, /e:/ or /i:/, 
/aܼ/ as /ܼ/, /ܼۑ/ as /ܮ:/, /eۑ/ as /ܼۑ/ and /ݜۑ/ as /aݜۑ/ or /u:/. This conflicts with 
the view of Kenworthy (1987) that Arabs rarely have problems with 
English diphthongs and with Baker (1982) that Arabs pronounce /eۑ/ as 
/i:/. 
4.3.1.6.4 Class 14: Easily Confused Vowels 
Due to the great difficulty which English vowels present to Arabs, these 
vowels were tested twice using different lists of words. This, in turn, 
played a role in confirming the previous results and adding some new 
findings as well, as shown in Table 23.

The explanation of the subjects’ erroneous pronunciation is given as 
follows: 
The results in Table 23 confirm the Arab subjects’ poor mastery of English 
vowels and matchthe previous findings regarding Arabs’ errors in English 
short vowels (Table 20), long vowels (Table 21) and diphthongs (Table 
22). In addition, it was found that the Arab subjects confused /ܤ:/ with /ݞ/ 
and /eܼ/ with /e/.  
4.3.1.6.5 Class 15: Intrusive Vowels 
The subjects had a tendency to insert an extra vowel into some English 
consonant combinations. This commonly occurs in pronouncing many 
English verbs such as ‘hanged’ */hængܼd/ as in Table 24.

The explanation of the subjects’ erroneous pronunciation is given as 
follows: 
English permits much longer initial, medial and final consonant clusters 
than Arabic. As a result, many subjects found difficulties in pronouncing 
English consonant sequences. Kharma and Hajjaj (1997) mention that 
Arabs often introduce an extra vowel into some English words. The 
findings in Table 24 support the view of Kharma and Hajjaj (1997).

4.3.1.6.6 Class 16: Vowel Reduction to Schwa 
Arabs find no problem in pronouncing function words such as, ‘to’, ‘are’ 
and ‘for’, when the full form is used in connected speech. But they find 
great difficulty in pronouncing the weak form of the same words which 
includes vowel reduction in unstressed syllables to schwa ԥ as in Table

The explanation of the subjects’ erroneous pronunciation is given as 
follows: 
In English, function words such as ‘at’, ‘for’ and ‘does’ can have full and 
weak forms. In their weak form, the vowel is reduced to schwa /ۑ/ in 
connected speech. Unlike English, the vowels of function words in Arabic 
keep their ‘full value’ whether in stressed or unstressed positions. As a 
result, the subjects found great difficulty in reducing the vowels of English 
function words to schwa in unstressed positions. 
Kenworthy (1987) points out that function words in Arabic do not have 
two forms – vowels in words in unstressed position keep their ‘full’ value, 
unlike vowels in unstressed words in English which are reduced to 
‘schwa’. This can give rise to the following errors: (a) use of full forms of 
pronouns and (b) use of full forms of auxiliary verbs when the weak form 
should be used. The results in Table 25 confirm the view of Kenworthy 
(1987).

4.3.1.6.7 Class 17: Vowel Length 
Vowel length in English presented a problem to the subjects. They had a 
tendency to make all long vowels equally long regardless of the voicing of 
the following consonants. For example, they would make the vowel in the 
word ‘lose’ /lu:z/ as long as that in the word ‘loose’ /lu:s/ as shown in 
Table 26.

The explanation of the subjects’ erroneous pronunciation is given as 
follows: 
The majority of the subjects made all English long vowels equally long 
and all short vowels equally short. This is because in Arabic, vowels vary 
in length regardless of the following consonant. In addition, this length can 
differentiate between the meaning of some words such as /ݧa:d/ ‘came 
back’ and /ݧadd/ ‘counted’. In English, vowel length depends on the 
voicing of the following consonant. Vowels are regularly longer before 
syllable-final voiced consonants than before voiceless consonants.  
Kharma and Hajjaj (1997) mention that Arab learners find difficulty in 
determining the length of the vowel preceding final voiced or voiceless 
consonants as in /seܼf/ ‘safe’ and /seܼv/ ‘save’. On the contrary, Nasr 
(1963) states that length in English does not constitute a phonological 
problem for the Arab student. The findings in Table 26 support the view of 
Kharma and Hajjaj (1997) but not that of Nasr (1963).

4.3.1.7 Summary of the Subjects’ Overall Vowel Errors Patterns: 
Word Group II 
The results in Word Group II reveal that many subjects have not yet 
mastered English vowels. The summary of the subjects’ overall vowel 
error patterns in this word group is now shown.  
Word Group II: (Vowels) (102 words):  
Result: Arabic speakers had difficulty with some English vowels and 
substituted their own Arabic vowel sounds for the unfamiliar English ones 
(i.e. L1 negative transfer), producing incorrect English vowels.  
- Class 11: (Short Vowels) (18 words)  
Result: Some of the English short vowels were difficult for Arabic 
speakers, since English has a greater number of vowels than Arabic.  
- Class 12: (Long Vowels) (12 words)  
Result: Some of the English long vowels were difficult for Arabic 
speakers, since English and Arabic have two different vowel structures or 
patterns.  
- Class 13: (Diphthongs) (16 words)  
 
Result: Some of the English diphthongs were difficult for Arabic 
speakers, since Arabic has no diphthongs.  
- Class 14: (Easily Confused Vowels) (56 words)   
The poor mastery of English vowels is the most noticeable feature in the 
English speech of Arabic speakers. Therefore, English vowels were tested 
twice using different lists of words. 
- (14 a): (Short Vowels) (14 words)  
Result: Some of the English short vowels were difficult for Arabic 
Speakers. 
- (14 b): (Long Vowels) (20 words)  
Result: Some of the English long vowels were difficult for Arabic 
Speakers.

- Class 15: (Intrusive Vowels) (5 words)  
Result: Some of these consonant clusters were difficult for Arabic 
speakers and they used an intrusive vowel as a cluster breaker. 
 Class 16: (Vowel Reduction to Schwa) (10 words)   
Result: Reducing the vowels of English function words to schwa ۑ was 
difficult for Arabic speakers, since function words in Arabic do not have 
two forms and unstressed vowels keep their full value. 
- Class 17: (Vowel Length) (22 words)  
Result: Vowel length was difficult for Arabic speakers, since Arabic 
vowels vary in length regardless of the following consonant.

The subjects’ total number and percentage of errors in English main word 
stress in Word Group III, by word class show the following. First, the 
majority of the subjects found difficulty in assigning main stress to 

Chapter Four 
 
180 
English words. Second, the subjects’ performance is best in stress 
contrasts (10.74%) and worst in stressing English words ending in a 
superheavy CVVC syllable (31.29%). Third, the subjects’ production of 
English main word stress confirms this research hypothesis that the 
subjects apply Arabic stress rules instead of English stress rules, producing 
incorrect English stress patterns. This shows that the incorrectly produced 
items are attributed to L1 Arabic negative transfer.  
An item analysis shows the frequency of main word stress errors by the 
subjects. If the tested word is common, the subjects just repeat what they 
have learnt or heard before. But if it is uncommon, they try to guess its 
stressing from the spelling. How familiar the item is to them is very 
important: the more common the spoken form and correct stressing of the 
item, the fewer errors the subjects make in English stress placement. The 
same applies to a native English speaker when he comes across a new or 
unfamiliar English word (e.g. scientific word), he will often mispronounce 
or wrongly stress it. It was expected that the subjects would make fewer 
errors while producing the following items: (a) commonly used or 
favourite words and (b) key words in their field of specialisation.  
4.3.1.9 Simple Word Stress 
4.3.1.9.1 Class 18: Unstressed Final V: or VV 
The subjects had a tendency to wrongly stress the last syllable of English 
words ending in a long vowel or a diphthong as in Table 28.

A comparison between English and Arabic word stress rules in Chapter 3 
reveals that the majority of the subjects stressed English words according 
to the stress rules of Arabic (i.e. L1 negative transfer). Many subjects 
stressed the last syllable of English words ending in unstressed final V: or 
VV, since Arabic stress rules require a final heavy CV: to receive main 
stress. Final stress is the unmarked stress pattern for Arabic words ending

in a long vowel as in /?a'bu:/ ‘his father’, /?a.'xu:/ ‘his brother’, /da.ra.'bu:/ 
‘they hit him’, /kata'bu:/ ‘they wrote it (s.m.)’, /?akal'ti:/ ‘you ate it (s.m.)’ 
and /rasa'mu:/ ‘they drew it (s.m.)’.  
According to Smith (1987), Arabic speakers have problems grasping the 
unpredictable nature of English word stress. Unlike the previous studies, 
the results in Table 28 show that twenty subjects pronounced ‘'igloo’ as 
*/ܼg'lu:/ and forty three subjects pronounced ‘'beautify’ as */bju:tܼ'faܼ/.  
4.3.1.9.2 Class 19: Unstressed Final CVVC 
Many subjects wrongly stressed the last syllable of English words ending 
in a long vowel or a diphthong plus a consonant such as ‘'multitude’ and 
‘'exercise’, as in Table 29.

The subjects stressed the last syllable of English words ending in an 
unstressed -CVVC, since in Arabic, a final superheavy –CVVC receives 
main stress (i.e. L1 negative transfer). Final stress is the unmarked stress 
pattern for Arabic words ending in a long vowel plus a consonant as in 
/sa.ka.'kiin/ ‘knives’, /ta.la.'miið/ ‘pupils’, /Ȗo.'la:f/ ‘cover’, ௧D/.'La:h/

‘key’, 
/bu.'ju:t/ 
‘houses’, 
/sa.'ݧi:d/‘happy’, /ki.'ta:b/ ‘book’ and /mi.'da:n/ ‘square’.  
Forty three subjects pronounced ‘'substitute’ as */sݞbstܼt'ju:t/ and forty 
four subjects pronounced ‘'telescope’ as */telܼs'kۑݜp/. This confirms the 
view of Kenworthy (1987) that Arab learners tend to transfer some of their 
mother tongue habits to English word stress: in words ending in a 
diphthong or a long vowel plus a consonant as in ‘institute’, Arabs tend 
also to stress the final syllable. 
4.3.1.9.3 Class 20: Unstressed Final CVCC 
English words ending in a vowel plus two consonants constituted a 
problem to the subjects. They wrongly stressed the last syllable as in Table 
30.

The subjects stressed the last syllable of English words ending in an 
unstressed –CVCC, since Arabic words are stressed on the last syllable 
when they end in a long vowel plus two consonants (i.e. L1 negative 
transfer). Final stress is the unmarked stress pattern for Arabic words 
ending in a superheavy –CVCC, as in /ka.'tabt/ ‘I wrote’, /da.'xalt/ ‘I went 
in’ and /fi.'himt/ ‘I understood’, /?a.'kalt/ ‘you (m.sing) ate’, /sa.'fart/ ‘I 
travelled and /Ta.'baxt/ ‘I cooked’.  
The results in Table 30 reveal that forty three subjects pronounced 
‘'scientist’ as */saܼn'tܼst/ and twenty seven subjects pronounced 
‘ad'vertisment’ as */ædvۑrtaܼz'ment/. This agrees with Kenworthy (1987) 
that in English words ending in -VCC such as ‘expert’, Arabs tend to 
stress the final syllable. 
4.3.1.9.4 Class 21: The CV'CVCV(C) Syllabic Pattern

Many subjects stressed the penultimate syllable of English words having 
the stress on the antepenult, since it is a characteristic of Arabic that a 
heavy penult receives main stress(i.e. L1 negative transfer). Penultimate 
stress is the unmarked stress pattern for Arabic words with a heavy 
penultimate syllable, as in /mu.'dar.ris/ ‘teacher (m.sing)’, /mu.'han.dis/ 
‘engineer (m.sing)’, /mu.'maș.șil/ ‘actor (m.sing)’, /ji.'fah.him/ ‘to

Many subjects stressed the antepenultimate syllable of English words 
having the stress on the preantepenultimate, since Arabic stress never 
precedes the antepenultimate syllable (i.e. always inside the three syllable 
window) as in /mux.'ta.li.fa/ ‘different (f. sing.)’, /ka.ta.'bi.tu/ ‘she wrote 
it’, /ra.sa.'mi.tu/ ‘she drew it (m.sing.)’, /ݦad.'wi.ya.tu/ ‘his drugs’,

verb on the second. However, the subjects wrongly stressed these words 
either both as nouns or verbs as in Table 34.

In English, some pairs of two-syllable words can be used as either a noun 
or a verb. Nouns are stressed on the first syllable, whereas verbs on the

second as follows: 'present (n.)/pre'sent (v.), 'object (n.)/ob'ject (v.), 'permit 
(n.)/perm'it, 'desert (n.)/de'sert (v.), 'contest (n.)/con'test (v.), 'protest 
(n.)/pro'test (v.), 'insult (n.)/in'sult (v.) and 'subject (n.)/sub'ject (v.). Arabic 
rarely uses stress to differentiate between pairs of words with identical 
spelling. In Arabic, contrastive stress is the marked stress pattern and 
Arabic instead uses word order to show strong contrast. The lowest 
percentage of errors corresponds to the words ‘our 'present’ and ‘to 
per'mit’, since the subjects commonly use them. Specifically, many 
subjects are familiar with the English noun ‘'present’ which they use a lot 
in contexts like ‘I will give you a present’ and ‘the simple present tense’.  
Kenworthy (1987) mentions that since Arabic uses word order to show 
strong contrast, Arab learners will be unfamiliar with the use of stress to 
show contrast as in English. Furthermore, Smith (1987) states that the idea 
that stress can alter meaning as in ‘con'vict’ (verb) and ‘'convict’ (noun) is 
completely strange. The findings in Table 32 confirms the views of 
Kenworthy (1987) and Smith (1987). 
4.3.1.10 Class 25: Compound Word Stress 
English compound nouns stressed on their first element constituted a 
problem for the subjects. As a consequence, they assigned these words 
either double stress or stressed the second element as in Table 35.

Arabic has at least two main stress patterns of compounds (Heliel, 1972): 
(A) Compounds with main stress on the second word as in 
 /fustan 'sahra/ ‘a night dress’ /Ta:biݧ ba'ri:d/ ‘postage stamp’ 
 /fu:l su'da:ni/‘peanuts’            "LݕݕDUT il-'awsat/ ‘Middle East’ 
  
(B) Compounds with two main stresses, one placed on each word as in 
 
ݕDQWD 'wara?/ ‘a paper bag’ /ga'wa:z 'safar/ ‘passport’ 
 /'ݧi:d 'mi'la:d/  ‘birthday’       /ݧa'Si:r la'mu:n/ ‘lemon juice’ 

Chapter Four

In English, two major groups can be distinguished (Fudge, 1984): 
(A) Compounds with main stress on the first word as in 
'night-dress 'mail-bag 'dining-room  'bookseller 
'feedback  'paper bag  'credit card  'childbirth 
 
(B) Compounds with two main stresses, one placed on each word as in 
'leather 'belts 'good'will 'stone'wall  'week'end 
'paper 'bag  'ice 'cream  'fare'well 'town 'hall 
 
While stress pattern (A) is used in both Arabic and English, Arabic tends 
to have main stress on the second element of the compound and English 
the first element. Stress pattern (B) is the same in both languages. As a 
result, some subjects found difficulties in stressing English compounds 
with main stress on their first element, instead stressing either both 
elements or the second element of the compound as in Arabic (i.e. L1 
negative transfer). 
4.3.1.11 Summary of the Subjects’ Overall Stress Patterns: Word 
Group III 
The results in Word Group III reveal that many subjects have not yet 
mastered English main word stress rules and that they stress the items by 
applying Arabic main word stress rules. The summary of the subjects’ 
overall stress error patterns in this word group is now shown.  
• Word Group III: English Main Word Stress (90 words):  
Result: The majority of the subjects applied Arabic stress rules (L1 
negative transfer), producing the incorrect English main word stress.  
(A) Simple Main Word Stress: (78 words): 
- Class 18: Unstressed Final V: or VV (10 words) 
Result: The majority of the subjects wrongly placed main stress on the 
final V: or VV, as in Arabic. 
- Class 19 Unstressed Final –CVVC (12 words) 
Result: The majority of the subjects wrongly placed main stress on the 
final CVVC, as in Arabic.

- Class 21: the CV'CVCV(C) Syllabic Pattern) (4 words) 
Result: Some of the subjects wrongly placed main stress on the initial CV, 
as in Arabic.  
- Class 22: Stressed Antepenult (12 words) 
Result: The majority of the subjects wrongly placed main stress on the 
antepenult, as in Arabic, since it is common in Arabic for a heavy penult to 
be stressed.  
- Class 23: Stressed Preantepenult (12 words) 
Result: The majority of the subjects wrongly placed main stress on the 
antepenult, as in Arabic, since stress in Arabic never precedes the three-
syllable window. 
- Class 24: Stress Contrasts (12 words) 
Result: Some of the subjects found difficulty in English contrastive stress, 
since it is not common in Arabic which uses word order to show contrast. 
They wrongly stressed the noun/verb pairs either both as nouns or as 
verbs. 
(B) Class 25: Compound Main Word Stress (12 words) 
Result: The majority of the subjects wrongly placed double main stress on 
both elements or stressed the second element in English compound nouns 
with main stress on their first element. 
4.4 Arabs’ Errors while Describing the Picture 
The time taken for reading the lists of words (approx. 15 minutes) was 
longer than the time taken for describing the picture (approx. 5 minutes). 
As a result, not all the errors found in the reading occurred in the 
description and some errors were repeated with different percentages. The 
results are shown in the tables below.

The findings in Tables 36–39 confirm some of the previous findings from 
the Arab subjects’ reading of the lists of words. In addition, while 
describing the picture, some errors were repeated with a higher percentage 
than in reading the lists of words. This indicates that the subjects made 
more English pronunciation errors in their spontaneous speech than in 
reading a written text.

4.5 General Discussion 
This section includes an analysis of the subjects’ grouped performance and 
errors in English sounds and main word stress in the light of (a) factors 
affecting L1 interference based on James (1980), (b) results of the 
previous studies on L2 sounds and word stress acquisition and (c) theories 
of L2 acquisition in chapter 2 and the predictions based on them. This 
section also explains the reasons for the subjects’ unexpected non-transfer, 
where the L1 negative transfer is blocked, producing correct English 
sounds and word stress patterns.  
4.5.1 The Subjects’ Grouped Performance 
The subjects’ total performance shows that their errors in English sounds 
and main word stress are due to L1 Arabic negative transfer. The subjects 
substituted their own Arabic sounds and stress rules for the unfamiliar 
English ones, producing incorrect English sounds and word stress patterns. 
The following table shows all the subjects’ total errors in English sounds 
and main word stress in Word Groups I, II and III.

In this research the subjects’ total percentage of stress errors (66.54%) in 
Word Group III which tests English stress different from Arabic was 
expected to be higher than the percentage in Word Group I, consonants 
(18.77%) and Word Group II, vowels (17.97). This shows that the subjects 
have not yet mastered English main word stress rules.  
The results may seem unexpected, but they reflect the real situation. Being 
a teacher of English in Egypt for about 6 years and knowing how Egyptian 
and Arab teachers of English are prepared and taught, I can confirm that 
pronunciation is highly neglected especially when it comes to word stress 
i.e. written English (90%) is taught more than spoken English (10%). It is 

Results 
 
191 
very rare for Arab teachers of English to explain English suprasegmental 
features such as word stress and intonation. This is due to the Egyptian and 
Arab educational systems which focus on grammar and writing and 
neglect pronunciation and speaking. Moreover, many of the Egyptian 
teachers of English are non-specialists: they studied history, philosophy or 
psychology (taught in Arabic) and were employed when there was a 
shortage of English language teachers. Hence, I am not surprised that the 
subjects have difficulty in English sounds in general and main word stress 
in particular. We have to also bear in mind that the subjects are a product 
of and taught by this kind of English language teacher. Therefore, the 
subjects are expected to be as bad as their teachers, since there was no 
good pronunciation model to be followed. Finally, the subjects did not 
make many errors in Word Group I testing consonants and Word Group II 
testing vowels, since many items used in these word groups are commonly 
used by the subjects.  
The subjects’ errors in English sounds and main word stress are due to 
many reasons such as: 
a) Most Arab countries consider English as a ‘school subject’ rather 
than a means of communication. In addition, English is taught 
through Arabic. 
b) Pronunciation is completely neglected as most teachers are neither 
phonetically trained nor in possession of the skill to teach spoken 
English. Thus, learners are eye-minded rather than ear-minded. 
c)  Examinations test the student’s knowledge of facts about the 
language and his ability to memorise but not his ability to use and 
understand English. 
d) The lack of discussing pronunciation errors related to interference 
between Arabic and English.  
e) Arabic and English have different sound and orthography systems, 
syllable 
structures, 
stress 
patterns 
and 
different 
cultural 
background. 
 
The obstacles depicted above, have led to a deterioration of the standard of 
Arabs’ spoken English. All Arab learners, therefore, should receive 
enough oral practice, as it is the key feature of mastering pronunciation.  
4.5.2 Unexpected Non-transfer 
L1 negative transfer was highly expected in Word Group I which tested 
English consonants, Word Group II which tested English vowels and 

Chapter Four 
 
192 
Word Group III which tested English word stress different from Arabic, 
leading to incorrect English sounds and stress patterns. However, it did not 
occur in some cases, producing neither sounds nor word stress errors. 
Similarly, unexpected non-L1 positive transfer occurred in some items and 
lead to errors in English sound and main word stress by the subjects.  
4.5.3 Analysis of Unexpected Non-transfer 
Although the main research question is to explain the reasons behind the 
Arab subjects’ errors in English sounds and main word stress, this section 
explains the facts which play a part in the counterexamples to that 
analysis. That is analysis of the cases where the subjects have successfully 
overcome the problem of L1 transfer and have produced accurate stress. 
The analysis of these cases show that they have the following points in 
common: 
(a)  The subjects have not mastered the rules of English sounds and 
main word stress and instead learnt the correctly produced items on 
a word-by-word basis. This shows that they have acquired the 
correct word stress patterns of these items in a lexical way without 
computing the L2 English stress parameter settings. 
(b) The subjects’ correct stressing of some items was due to applying 
some rules of analogy of some well known words such as 
‘'demonstrate’ for ‘'demonstrator’, ‘i'magine’ for ‘i'maginary’ and 
‘'beauty’ for ‘'beautify’. 
(c) Familiarity plays a part in the subjects’ sounds and stress 
production, since most of the correctly stressed items and sounds 
are words which the subjects are familiar with and their correct 
English stressing, especially loanwords in Arabic such as ‘a'genda, 
demo'cratic, re'gime and com'puter’.  
 
An item analysis shows the frequency of sounds and main word stress 
errors by the subjects. If the tested word is common, the subjects just 
repeat what they have learnt or heard before. But if it is uncommon, they 
try to guess its pronunciation from the spelling. How familiar the item is to 
them is very important: the more common the spoken form and correct 
stressing of the item, the fewer errors the subjects make in English stress 
placement. The same applies to a native English speaker when he comes 
across a new or unfamiliar English word (e.g. scientific word), he will 
often mispronounce or wrongly stress it. It was expected that the subjects 
would make fewer errors while producing the following items: commonly 
used or favourite words and key words in their field of specialisation.

4.5.4 Factors Affecting L1 Interference 
This section analyses the subjects’ errors in English sounds and main word 
stress based on the factors affecting L1 interference stated in Chapter 1: 
Introduction, following James (1980), as follows. 
 (A) Amount and Nature of L2 Input 
It is most likely that the subjects’ errors in English sounds and main word 
stress were affected by this factor, since their L2 spoken English input is 
very limited due to three reasons. First, their lack of exposure to native 
spoken English for being taught by teachers who focus more on the written 
than the spoken form due to the demands of the Arab educational systems. 
Second, many teachers are not specialist teachers of English and teach 
English through Colloquial Arabic. Third, the lack of discussion of 
pronunciation errors especially the suprasegmental ones (e.g. stress and 
intonation) that are related to Arabic interference. The importance of L2 
input (comprehensible input) is considered as the only mechanism that 
results in the L2 learners’ increase of linguistic competence following 
Krashen’s (1977) Monitor theory. 
(B) Linguistic Distance between L1 and L2  
Arabic and English are two languages which belong to two different 
linguistic families. Arabic is the chief member of the Semitic family of 
languages, whereas English belongs to the Indo-European family. 
Therefore, both languages are dissimilar in many sounds and features such 
as stress rules, and these differences are the major sources of the subjects’ 
transfer errors (i.e. L1 negative transfer). The greater the linguistic 
distance between two languages, the higher the number of expected errors 
by the L2 speakers. The subjects’ incorrect English sounds and stress 
patterns are mainly due to transferring their L1 Arabic sounds and main 
word stress rules to the tested English words. 
(C) Task Focus 
It is most likely that the subjects’ errors in English sounds and main word 
stress which were due to L1 interference were related to their focus on 
grammatical forms (written English) rather than on ‘communicative 
effectiveness’ (spoken English). This shows that the cognitive load plays a 
part in the subjects’ correct sounds and stressing of the items.  
 

Chapter Four 
 
194 
(D) L2 learning Stage 
The subjects’ were less affected by this factor which shows that beginners 
are more affected during the L2 learning process by interference than 
advanced learners, since there was not much difference in the percentage 
of sounds and stress errors among the three subject samples.  
4.5.5 Studies on L2 Stress Production 
The analysis section explains the subjects’ errors in English sounds and 
main word stress in the light of a main L2 stress learning strategy followed 
in the previous studies on L2 stress production: L1 parameter settings 
(Archibald, 1994). This section explains that some of the subjects’ stress 
errors are based on two other L2 stress learning strategies in the previous 
L2 stress studies: lexical acquisition of L2 stress (Archibald, 1997) and 
overgeneralisation of L2 stress rules (Caspers and Van Santon, 2006). 
Each one of these two L2 strategies is now discussed in detail. 
4.5.5.1 Lexical Acquisition of L2 Stress 
This section explains that some subjects correctly stressed some items 
without applyingpositive transfer of L1 parameter settings. It is based on 
the L2 English lexical storage of stress instead of stress parameter 
computation, following Archibald (1997). The subjects who correctly 
produced some items memorised their stress placement and stored it as 
part of their lexical entry as shown below. 
Class 18: (unstressed final V: or VV) 
'identify, 'holiday, 'castaway, 'carboy, 'whitlow 
Class 19: (unstressed final -CVVC) 
'prosecute, 'demonstrate, 'mutlitude, 'telegraph, 'carbide  
Class 20: (unstressed final -CVCC) 
'punishment, 'difficult, 'evident, 'applicant, 'concept, 'impact 
Class 21: (the CV'CVCV(C) pattern)  
so'licit  
 

Results 
 
195 
Class 22: (unstressed heavy penult) 
'cucumber, 'messenger, 'passenger, 'barrister, 'thermostat  
Class 23: (stressed preantepenult) 
'mercenary, 'characterise, 'legislative, 'matrimony, i'maginary 
Class 24: (contrastive stress) 
our 'protest, to pro'test, to ex'port, our 'export, to pro'gress, our 'progress  
Class 25: (compound stress) 
'apple tree, 'flowerpot, 'workshop, 'classroom, 'birthday  
The lexical acquisition of these items shows that the Arabic speakers store 
the L2 English stress lexically for some items instead of applying stress 
parameters, producing correct L2 English stress patterns. 
4.5.5.2 Overgeneralisation of L2 Stress Rules 
This section explains how some subjects incorrectly stressed some items 
due to their overgeneralisation of L2 stress rules, following Caspers and 
Van Santen (2006) and Caspers and Kepinska (2011). This shows that the 
subjects’ stress errors are not only due to interlingual factors, as discussed 
before, but also to intralingual factors as shown below. 
Class 18: (unstressed final V: or VV) 
Some subjects may have overgeneralised the final stress pattern of some 
well known English words to them such as ‘refu'gee, trai'nee, ta'boo, 
bam'boo, guaran'tee, refe'ree, su'pply, re'ply and em'ploy’ to the items with 
unstressed final V: or VV in Word Group III, Class 18, such as ‘'igloo, 
'beautify, 'cargo and identify’, producing incorrect L2 English final stress 
patterns. 
Class 19: (unstressed final -CVVC) 
Some subjects may have overgeneralised the final stress pattern of some 
well known English words to them such as ‘com'plain, maga'zine, 
trans'late, pro'vide, com'pete, seven'teen, po'lice and di'vine’ to the items 
with unstressed final –CVVC in Word Group III, Class 19, such as 

Chapter Four 
 
196 
‘'gratitude, 'substitute, 'criticise, 'telegraph and 'telescope’, producing 
incorrect English final stress patterns. 
Class 20: (unstressed final -CVCC) 
Some subjects may have overgeneralised the final stress pattern of some 
well known English words to them such as ‘pro'tect, con'sent, re'spond, 
su'ggest, pre'vent, ex'pect and re'lax’ to the items with unstressed final –
CVCC in Word Group III, Class 20, such as ‘'manifest, 'product, 
'impotent, 'impact, 'applicant and 'occupant’, producing incorrect English 
final stress pattern. 
Class 21: (the CV'CVCV(C) pattern) 
Some subjects may have overgeneralised the initial stress pattern of some 
well known English words to them such as ‘'medical, 'positive, 'memory, 
'visitor, 'family, 'citizen and 'minimum’ to the items with the 
CV'CVCV(C) syllabic pattern in Word Group III, Class 21, such as 
‘so'licit, te'rrific, and de'posit’, producing the incorrect English stress 
pattern 'CVCVCV(C). 
Class 22: (unstressed heavy penult) 
Some subjects may have overgeneralised the stressed heavy penult pattern 
of some well known English words to them such as ‘de'fender, a'genda, 
ro'mantic, re'member, ba'nana, re'corder and com'puter’ to the items with 
unstressed heavy penult in Word Group III, Class 22, such as ‘'calender, 
'protestant, 'barrister and 'cucumber’, producing incorrect L2 English 
stressed heavy penult pattern. 
4.5.6 Theories of L2 Acquisition 
In the light of three of the six theories of L2 (phonology) acquisition: 
Contrastive Analysis, Error Analysis and Markedness Theory, discussed in 
chapter 2, predictions are made with respect to the current study. These 
predictions will be tested in this section, to find out whether or not they are 
confirmed and if the findings provide any evidence for any of the three L2 
theories below.  
4.5.6.1 Contrastive Analysis Hypothesis (CAH) 
This section explains the reasons for the subjects’ errors in English sounds 
and main word stress based on the differences between Arabic and English 

Results 
 
197 
stress rules (i.e. interlingual reasons). The results of the tested English 
sounds and stress patterns provide strong evidence for theories of L2 
acquisition such as Contrastive Analysis Hypothesis (CAH) (Lado, 1957). 
According to the CAH, it was predicted that English sounds and main 
word stress patterns that are different from corresponding Arabic ones will 
cause learning difficulties for the Arabic speakers, whereas the similar 
sounds and stress patterns will not. The subjects’ errors are due to L1 
negative transfer. The results of the tested sounds and stress patterns 
confirmed this CAH prediction. 
Some subjects made errors in English consonant sounds which are 
different from Arabic ones such as /p/, /v/, ƾ dark ڢ syllabic consonants 
and consonant doubling. They also had trouble with two-element clusters 
beginning with /p/, /s/, /g/, ݇ consonant + /j/, /dw/ and all three-element 
clusters. In addition, they inserted a vowel between the elements of medial 
and final clusters. Regarding vowels, the subjects confused most of the 
English vowels and diphthongs with each other or substituted Arabic 
vowels for English ones. The findings also showed that the subjects had 
difficulty with stressing the items ending in V:/VV, CVVC and CVCC, the 
CV'CVCV(C) pattern, stress contrasts, stressed preantepenult, unstressed 
heavy penult and compounds. By contrast, the items with sounds and 
stress similar to Arabic were not problematic for most of the subjects. 
Many subjects found difficulty in acquiring the English stress rules which 
are different from those in Arabic and are tested by the items in Word 
Groups III. Therefore, these subjects applied their different Arabic stress 
rules to the items (i.e. L1 negative transfer) as indicated by their high 
percentage of stress errors (66.54% in Word Group III). The subjects who 
made no errors in some English sounds and main word stress positively 
transferred their similar Arabic sounds and word stress rules to the items 
producing them correctly, as shown by their low percentage of errors in 
English consonants (18.77) and vowels (17.97%). The results are in line 
with the Contrastive Analysis Hypothesis.  
 4.5.6.2 Error Analysis (EA) 
This section explains the reasons for the subjects’ errors in English sounds 
and main word stress based on not only the differences between the Arabic 
and English sounds and stress rules (i.e. interlingual factors) but also due 
to intralingual factors. The findings also provide evidence for Error 
Analysis (EA) (Corder, 1967). According to EA, it was predicted that the 
sounds and main word stress errors made by the subjects are due to 
interlingual (i.e. due to L1 negative transfer) and intralingual factors (i.e. 

Chapter Four 
 
198 
due to other factors such as individual differences). The results of the 
tested English sounds and stress patterns confirmed this prediction, since 
they show that the subjects’ errors in English sounds and main word stress 
are due to not only interlingual reasons (i.e. L1 Arabic negative transfer) 
but also to intralingual reasons such as hypercorrection, simplification, 
overgeneralisation of L2 rules, false concepts, fossilisation, lack of 
practice, limited exposure to native spoken English and poor teaching 
materials. 
4.5.6.3 Markedness Theory 
This section explains the reasons for the subjects’ errors in English sounds 
and main word stress based not only on the differences between Arabic 
and English sounds and word stress rules (i.e. CAH), but also due to the 
degree of difficulty of the different sounds and word stress rules (i.e. 
typological markedness). The Markedness Differential Hypothesis (MDH) 
explains the reasons for sounds and stress errors which occur in an area of 
difference between Arabic and English sounds and stress rules. Table 41 
shows the scale of markedness of sounds and stress production errors in all 
word classes by all the subjects.

4.5.6.3.1 The Markedness Differential Hypothesis (MDH) 
The results of Word Group I: English consonants, Word Group II: English 
vowels and Word Group III: English word stress provide evidence for 
Eckman’s (1977) Markedness Differential Hypothesis (MDH) which is a 
reformulation of the CAH that incorporates the notion of typological 
markedness. According to the MDH, it was predicted that English sounds 
and main word stress patterns that are both different and more marked than 
corresponding L1 Arabic sounds and main word stress patterns will cause 
learning difficulties for the Arabic speakers. The results of the tested items 
confirmed this MDH prediction. Table 42 shows the ranking of sounds 
and word stress production errors by word class.

4.6 Chapter Summary 
This chapter presents the subjects’ errors in English sounds and main word 
stress and the reasons behind them. It includes four sections. The first 
section showed the results of the production test as the subjects’ errors in 
English consonants and the reasons behind them. 
The second was their errors in English vowels and the reasons behind 
them. The third was their errors in English main word stress and the

reasons behind them. The fourth section was a general discussion which 
analysed the subjects’ errors in the light of the results of the previous 
studies on L2 stress production and three theories of L2 acquisition: 
Contrastive Analysis, Error Analysis and Markedness Theory.  
The subjects found difficulty in pronouncing some English consonants 
such as /p/, /v/, /ƾ/, dark /ڢ/, syllabic consonants and consonant doubling. 
They also had trouble with two-element clusters beginning with /p/, /s/, 
/g/, /݇/, consonant + /j/, /dw/ and all three-element clusters. In addition, 
they inserted a vowel between the elements of medial and final clusters. 
Regarding vowels, the subjects confused most of the English vowels and 
diphthongs with each other or substituted Arabic vowels for English ones. 
Finally, they stressed the last syllable of English words ending in V:, V:C 
and VCC and the first syllable of words having the syllabic pattern 
CVCVCV(C). 
The findings had evidence for these theories of L2 acquisition: Contrastive 
Analysis Hypothesis (CAH) and Error Analysis (EA) and for the results of 
studies on L2 stress such as lexical acquisition of stress and 
overgeneralisation of L2 stress rules. Finally, the analysis of cases of 
unexpected non-transfer showed that they were not due to rule based 
learning but instead lexically learnt item by item.  
The next chapter presents a summary of the findings, some teaching 
suggestions, limitations of the study and suggestions for further research.  

 
 
CHAPTER FIVE 
TEACHING SUGGESTIONS  
 
 
 
This book analyses Arabs’ errors in English pronunciation regarding 
consonants, consonant clusters, vowels and main word stress due to L1 
interference in the light of three theories of L2 acquisition: Contrastive 
Analysis (CA), Error Analysis (EA) and Markedness Theory. This research 
has two hypotheses. First, the subjects substitute their own Arabic sounds 
(i.e. L1 negative transfer) for the unfamiliar English ones, producing incorrect 
English sounds. Second, the subjects apply Arabic stress rules (i.e. L1 negative 
transfer) instead of English ones, producing incorrect English stress patterns. 
These hypotheses were confirmed, albeit to different degrees due to sounds 
and stress patterns (word class), as shown in the results. This chapter presents 
some teaching suggestions to help Arabic speakers to avoid these errors.        
5.1 Teaching Suggestions 
5.1.1 Suggestions for Teaching Consonants 
In view of the results, the following recommendations are suggested for 
teaching and correcting Arabs’ pronunciation of English consonants. 
 
(1) Teachers can prepare consonant sound exercises in the light of English 
consonant sound errors due to negative transfer. This helps learners to 
suppress L1 negative transfer and learn English consonant sound rules.  
Considering the markedness factors, Arabic teachers should pay more 
attention to the marked English consonant sound patterns (less 
common) which are more difficult to acquire than unmarked ones 
(more common), according to the following scale of markedness. 
 
(a) Affricates  
(b) Fricatives                                       
(c) Laterals                                     
(d) Nasals                                             
(e) Plosives                                          
(f) Semi-vowels                              

Teaching Suggestions  
 
 
203 
(2) Teachers can use ‘minimal pair drills’.  A minimal pair is two words 
which differ in meaning when only one sound is changed.  For 
example: 
p/b park/bark;  pear/bear 
 
f/v  fine/vine;  fan/van 
 
(3) Teachers can use ‘tongue twisters’.  A tongue twister is a sequence of 
words which is difficult to pronounce quickly and correctly, as follows.     
•  Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers. 
•  She sells sea shells on the sea shore. 
•  Picky people pick Peter Pan Peanut-Butter. 
•  A big black bug bit a big black dog on his big black nose! 
•  Six slimy snails sailed silently. 
•  The great Greek grape growers grow great Greek grapes. 
•  This is the sixth zebra snoozing thoroughly. 
 
(4) Teachers can give a physical demonstration of how to make the 
consonant sounds.  For example, to teach /݇/ or /ð/ say:  ‘This is the tip 
of my tongue.  These are my teeth.  Put the tip of your tongue between 
your teeth.’ 
 
(5)  For difficulties with aspiration of /p, t, k/, the following techniques can 
be used: 
• 
Teachers can ask their students to pronounce the sound /h/ 
immediately after these three sounds.  To facilitate this, teachers 
can use ‘help-words’ beginning with ‘h’ for the main words 
beginning with /p, t, k/.  For example, to pronounce ‘part’ teachers 
can tell their students to make /p/ and then say ‘heart’ and so on: 
 
 
 
     
     MAIN WORD      HELP-WORD 
 
 
 
 
part 
 
heart 
 
 
                            ten 
 
hen 
 
 
       
  
cot 
 
hot 
 
 
 • To demonstrate the presence of a puff of air, teachers can hold a 
lighted match or a thin piece of paper in front of the mouth while 
pronouncing words beginning with /p, t, k/.  If aspiration is present, 
the match will flicker or the paper move. 
 
(6) In teaching /݇/, teachers can use the symbol itself as a memory clue.  
For example, teachers can draw an enlarged symbol to represent the 

Chapter Five 
 
 
204
open mouth, and the crossbar to represent the tongue protruding 
between the teeth. 
 
(7) Regarding silent letters, teachers can draw their students’ attention to 
the gap between English orthography and pronunciation.  Furthermore, 
they should advise them not to pronounce all English words 
phonetically.  
 
(8) Regarding consonant doubling, teachers can train their students not to 
double the pronunciation of English double consonants except for a 
few words such as ‘midday’; ‘dissatisfied’; ‘bookcase’ etc. 
 
(9) Regarding syllabic consonants, teachers can explain to their students 
that some English consonants (such as /l/, /m/, /n/ and /r/) can 
constitute syllables by themselves.  Furthermore, they should train 
them to pronounce words including such consonants such as ‘middle’; 
‘rhythm’; ‘button’; ‘Hungary’ etc.   
 
(10) Teachers can use the ‘pencil trick’ to distinguish between the points 
of articulation for /n/ and /ƾ/. Students are asked to place a pencil 
sideways across the mouth and pronounce the two sounds.  The tip of 
the tongue will touch the pencil if the /n/ is pronounced correctly and it 
will be down behind the front teeth without touching the pencil when 
the /ƾ/ is produced accurately. 
 
(11) Regarding dark /ܽ/, teachers can train their students to pronounce /l/ 
with the back of the tongue raised towards the soft palate when it is 
followed by a consonant or occurs word-finally as in ‘belt’ or ‘bell’.  In 
addition, the learner must try to say a (u) vowel whilst the mouth is in 
the right position. 
 
(12) Regarding the RP /r/, teachers can train their students not to 
pronounce final /r/ unless it is followed by a word beginning with a 
vowel, and also not to pronounce /r/ within words if it is followed by 
another consonant. 
 
(13) Teachers can provide auditory or visual associations for the consonant 
sounds.  For example, a buzzing bee demonstrates the pronunciation of 
/z/ and a hissing snake demonstrates /s/. 
 

Teaching Suggestions  
 
 
205 
(14) Teachers can use authentic English rhymes and songs such as: 
 
    Whether the weather be hot, 
       Whether the weather be cold,  
 
    Whatever the weather, 
 
    We’ll weather the weather, 
 
    Whether we like it or not. 
 
(15) To understand voicing, learners touch their throats to feel for 
vibration or no-vibration while producing voiced or voiceless 
consonants respectively. 
 
(16) Teachers can demonstrate the sound /p/ by showing lip movement 
and then practising the voiceless /p/ before illustrating the contrast 
between /p/ and /b/. 
 
(17) Teachers can train those learners who confuse /݇/ and /ð/ to 
pronounce /݇/ as a voiceless sound, a hissing sound made with strong 
breath and /ð/ as a voiced sound, a buzzing sound made with weak 
breath. 
 
(18) Teachers can specifically drill the sound /ð/ in its most common 
words, e.g. the, this, these, that, those, them, with etc. 
 
(19) Teachers can train Arabic speakers to pronounce ‘th’ /݇/ as one sound 
instead of two separate sounds /t/ + /h/ or the single sound /t/. 
 
(20) Arabic speakers can learn to produce /݇/ as a separate phoneme from 
/s/ and /ð/ as a separate phoneme from /z/.  In addition, teachers can 
train them to pronounce /݇/ and /ð/ with the tip of the tongue between 
the upper and lower teeth and to pronounce /s/ and /z/ with the tongue 
behind the teeth. 
 
 
(21) With Arabic speakers who pronounce /݇/ as /s/ or /ð/ as /z/ and /݇/ as 
/t/, teachers can make use of contrasts like the following: 
 
s/݇   sing/thing;    sick/thick;            mouse/mouth;  moss/moth 
 
z/ð zeal/these;    breeze/breathe;    pleasing/breathing  
 
(22) In teaching /v/, teachers can train their students to produce /v/ as a 
voiced buzzing sound.  In addition, they can train them to pronounce 
/v/ with less force of breath than /f/. 
 

Chapter Five 
 
 
206
(23) In teaching /ݕ/ and /ݤ/, teachers can train their students to pronounce 
/ݕ/ as a voiceless, hissing sound and /ݤ/ as a voiced, buzzing sound.  
They can also tell them that /ݤ/ never occurs initial position.  In 
addition, 
teachers 
can 
make 
use 
of 
contrasts 
such 
as 
‘pressure/treasure’, ‘vacation/ occasion’ etc. 
 
(24) Teachers can train learners to pronounce the sound /ݹ/ as one element 
instead of /t/ + /ݕ/.  In addition, they can teach it with reference to its 
most common spelling ‘ch’ particularly in initial position. 
 
(25) Teachers can train learners to pronounce the sound /ݶ/ as one 
element instead of /d/ + /ݤ/ in all positions.  In addition, the sound can 
be drilled with reference to the spellings ‘g’, ‘j’, ‘dg’ and ‘di’. 
 
(26) Regarding difficulty with /ƾ/, teachers can use the following: 
•    Descriptions of actions in the present continuous tense: 
 
I am eating now.    I am reading now. 
• 
Practise of ‘wh’ questions: 
 
Teacher:  Where are you going? 
 
Student:  I am going to the cinema. 
• 
Contrast of minimal pairs: 
 
ƾk/ƾ   think/thing;  sink/sing;  wink/wing. 
 
n/ƾ     win/wing;  thin/thing;  ban/bang. 
 
(27)  In teaching /r/, teachers can train their students to curl the tip of the 
tongue backwards and upwards in the mouth so that it is quite close to 
the highest part of the palate, but not so close to cause friction as the 
air streams out.  In addition, they can explain to them that /r/ is not a 
buzzing sound. This can be achieved by using help-sounds such as /j/ 
or /i:/ which are similar in their articulation to the English sound /r/.  
First, the students can get ready to pronounce /j/ or /i:/, then curl the tip 
of the tongue slightly upwards without moving the sides of the tongue. 
 
(28)  Regarding difficulty with /w/, teachers can use the following: 
• 
Practice of ‘wh’ questions: 
 
Where do you live? 
 
When did you leave? 
• 
Practice telling the time: 
 
Teacher:  What is the time? 
 
Student:  It is a quarter past four.

5.1.2 Suggestions for Teaching Consonant Clusters 
In view of the results, the following recommendations are suggested for 
teaching and correcting Arabs’ pronunciation of English consonant 
clusters: 
 
(1) Teachers can prepare consonant clusters exercises in the light of 
English consonant cluster   errors due to negative transfer. This helps 
learners to suppress L1 negative transfer and learn English consonant 
cluster rules. Considering the markedness factors, Arabic teachers 
should pay more attention to the marked English consonant cluster 
patterns (less common) which are more difficult to acquire than 
unmarked ones (more common), according to the following scale of 
markedness. 
 
(a) Medial Consonant Clusters           
(b) Initial Consonant Clusters             
(c) Final Consonant Clusters           
 
(2) Teachers can train their students not to insert a short vowel or a glottal 
stop and a short vowel before each cluster. 
 
(3) In teaching English initial clusters including /s/ + consonant, teachers 
can train their students to begin by uttering a long /s/ (i.e. ssss…), then 
stop this /s/ by closing the lips in preparation for the following /p/ or 
/m/, or by raising the tip of the tongue to the alveolar ridge in 
preparation for the following /t/, /n/ or /l/, or by raising the back of the 
tongue to the velum in preparation for /k/. 
 
(4) To help those students who find difficulty with final two- and three-
element clusters, teachers can start with practising an identical 
sequence in the form of help-phrases and gradually decreasing the time 
between the two elements: 
 
 
  
HELP-PHRASES 
MAIN WORD 
 
                   
publish two books         
published 
                        
wrong direction             
wronged 
 
(5) To help those students who find difficulty with final three-element 
clusters containing a edial /t/ or /k/, teachers can explain to them that 
these medial sounds are often reduced to a single lengthened consonant 
in words such as ‘asks’ and ‘lists’ or is sometimes omitted, resulting in 
pronunciations such as the following: 

Chapter Five 
 
 
208
     
asks 
 
/æs::/ 
 
 
facts 
 
/fæks/ 
 
(6) Teachers can train their students to pronounce the -s suffix according 
to the following phonological rule: 
a)  When a noun or verb ends in a voiceless sound that is not a sibilant 
/s, z, ݕ, ݤ, t, d /, the -s suffix is pronounced /s/: 
 
cats   /kæts/    stops   /stܥps/ 
b) When a noun or verb ends in a voiced sound that is not a sibilant, 
the -s suffix is pronounced /z/: 
 
seeds   /si:dz/   sees   /si:z/ 
c) When a noun or verb ends in a sibilant, the -s suffix is pronounced 
/z/: 
 
glasses   /glæsۑz/ 
rises   /raܼzۑz/ 
 
(7) Teachers can train their students to pronounce the -ed suffixes 
according to the following phonological rule: 
a) When a verb ends in a voiceless sound other than /t/, the -ed suffix 
is pronounced /t/: 
marked    /mܤ:kt/    published    /pݞblܼݕt/ 
b) When a verb ends in a voiced sound other than /d/, the -ed suffix is 
pronounced /d/: 
 
proved    /pru:vd/    played    /pleܼd/ 
c) When a verb ends in the sound /d/ or /t/, the -ed suffix is 
pronounced/ۑd/: 
 
needed    /ni:dۑd/    rested    /restۑd/ 
5.1.3 Suggestions for Teaching Vowels 
In view of the results, the following recommendations are suggested for 
teaching and correcting Arabs’ pronunciation of English vowels. 
 
(1) Teachers can prepare vowel sound exercises in the light of English 
vowel sound errors due to negative transfer. This helps learners to 
suppress L1 negative transfer and learn English vowel   sound rules.  
Considering the markedness factors, Arabic teachers should pay more 
attention to the marked English consonant sound patterns (less 
common) which are more difficult to acquire than unmarked ones 
(more common), according to the following scale of markedness.  
                           
                                  

Teaching Suggestions  
 
 
209 
(a) Vowel Reduction to Schwa                     
(b) Vowel Length                                              
(c) Diphthongs                           
(d) Long Vowels                                
(e) Easily Confused Vowels                      
(f) Short Vowels                                
 
(2) Teachers can use ‘minimal pair drills’: 
       ܼ/e        pin/pen; tin/ten 
 
 ୆:/ܥ        cord/cod; short/shot 
 
(3) Teachers can give a physical demonstration of how to make the vowel 
sound. For example, rounding the lips and lowering the jaw for /୆:/. 
 
(4) With learners who find difficulty with the English vowels /i:/, /ܼ/, /e/ 
and /æ/, teachers can make sure that the learner’s tongue is in the right 
position, neither too close nor too far away from the roof of the mouth. 
 
(5) In teaching /ۑ/, teachers can emphasise the spread position of the lips. 
To achieve this, they can ask their students to smile while pronouncing 
this sound. 
 
(6) In teaching /ۑ/, teachers can remind their students that it is the sound 
one makes when one is suddenly hit in the stomach. 
 
(7) In teaching /ܤ:/, teachers can remind their students that it is the sound 
doctors ask patients to make when they want them to open their 
mouths wide for throat examinations. 
 
(8) Teachers can pay special attention to those English diphthongs that do 
not occur in Arabic, and drill them both in words and in connected 
speech. 
 
(9) Teachers can train their students to glide from one vowel to another 
while pronouncing the English diphthongs.  For example, students 
should not use the following: 
• Arabic /o:/ as in /fo:z/  ‘victory’ for English /ۑݜ/ as in /stۑݜv/ ‘stove’. 
• Arabic /u:/ as in /du:r/  ‘houses’ for English /ݜۑ/ as in /tݜۑ/ ‘tour’. 
 
(10) In teaching /ۑݜ/, teachers can train their students to begin with the lips 
in neutral position to pronounce /ۑ/, then slight rounding and closing as 
for /ݜ/. 

Chapter Five 
 
 
210
(11) Teachers can try to help their students with some of the spelling 
patterns in English.  For example, the addition of a final ‘e’ to words 
usually means the following: 
• 
a change from /æ/ to /eܼ/ 
 
hat/hate   bath/bathe 
• 
a change from /ܼ/ to /aܼ/ 
 
sit/site   fin/fine 
• 
a change from /ݞ/ to /ju:/ 
      tun/tune   cut/cute 
 
(12) Teachers can train their students to predict where English vowels and 
diphthongs are reduced to /ۑ/ in unstressed positions.  In addition, they 
can emphasise that this vowel can be spelled in different ways but the 
pronunciation remains the same.  In practising /ۑ/, the following 
exercises can be useful: 
•    
Words including a short unstressed ‘a’ in different positions: 
      Initial:   attend, again, alone etc. 
      Medial:  character, breakfast, emphasis etc. 
      Final:     banana, phenomena, agenda etc. 
•  
Compound words ending in ‘-man’: 
policeman, postman, fisherman etc. 
• 
Words ending in ‘-ar’: 
 
particular, familiar, collar etc. 
• 
Words ending in ‘-er’: 
 
letter, danger, clever etc. 
•    
Words ending in ‘-or’: 
 
actor, sailor, professor etc. 
• 
Words ending in: 
 
‘-able’ reasonable, capable, sociable etc. 
 
‘-ance’ balance, clearance, substance etc. 
 
‘-ant’ 
pleasant, infant, distant etc. 
 
‘-ent’ 
different, prominent, president etc. 
• 
Adjectives ending in ‘-ate’: 
 
accurate, adequate, desperate etc. 
• 
Words including unstressed ‘o’ in different positions: 
 
carrot,  potato, position etc. 
• 
Words including unstressed ‘u’ in different positions: 
 
support,  autumn,  suggest,  suffice,  etc. 
• 
Words including ‘-ough’ which is pronounced /ۑ/: 
 
thorough,  borough etc. 
• 
Words ending in ‘-ous’: 

Teaching Suggestions  
 
 
211 
 
famous, enormous, cautious etc. 
• 
The weak forms of function words such as: 
 
Conjunctions:  but, than, and etc. 
 
Indefinite adjectives:  such, some, any etc. 
 
Personal pronouns:  her, them, you etc. 
 
Prepositions:  at, for, to, etc. 
 
Articles:  a, an, the 
 
Auxiliary verbs: can, was, have, does etc. 
 
(13) To explain the contrast between /i:/ and /ܼ/, and between /u:/ and /ݜ/, 
teachers can make use of muscular tension.  For example, they can 
ask their students to clench their fists when practising tense vowels 
(/i:/, /u:/ etc.) and to open and relax them when producing lax 
sounds (/ܼ/, /ݜ/, etc). 
 
(14) To enable Arab learners to pronounce correctly the weak forms of 
English function words, Teachers can use exercises including the 
words in both their strong and weak forms as follows: 
WORD  STRONG FORM                           WEAK FORM 
for          /f୆:/     What is he waiting for?         
/fۑ/    It’s for you. 
are 
 /ܤ:/     Here they are 
               /ۑ/     Where are you going? 
could       /kݜd/   I would stay if I could.        
 /kۑd/  Could you do it now? 
 
(15) Learners can bear in mind that a long vowel followed by a consonant 
should be longer than the same vowel followed by a voiceless 
consonant. 
 
(16) Learners can stretch rubber bands to illustrate length of vowels. 
5.1.4 Suggestions for Teaching Word Stress 
In view of the results, the following recommendations are suggested for 
teaching English word stress to Arab learners: 
 
(1) Teachers can prepare stress exercises in the light of English stress 
errors due to negative transfer. This helps learners to suppress L1 
negative transfer and learn English stress rules.  Considering the 
markedness factors, Arabic teachers should pay more attention to the 
marked English stress patterns (less common) which are more difficult 
to acquire than unmarked ones (more common), according to the 
following scale of markedness. 
 

Chapter Five 
 
 
212
(a)  Unstressed Final -CVVC 
      Many English words ending in CVVC have initial stress: 
      'prosecute  'multitude  'capitalise  'telescope 'telegraph 
 
(b) Compounds With Initial Stress 
      It is very common for compound nouns to have stress on the first 
element: 
      'blackbird 'chairman  'greenhouse  'hotdog  'sunset 'teamwork 
 
(c) Stressed Preantepenult 
    Many English words have preantepenult stress: 
     'category 'territory  'adequacy  'mercernary 
 
(d) Unstressed Final V: or VV 
      A large class of English words ending in V: or VV have initial 
stress: 
      'igloo  'tepee  'cuckoo  'certify  'cowboy 
 
(e)  The CV'CVCV(C) Syllabic Pattern 
      Many English words with the CV'CVCV(C) syllabic pattern have 
penult stress: 
      pa'cific ter'rific  pho'nemic  so'licit  de'posit 
 
(f)  Unstressed Final -CVCC 
      Many English words ending in CVCC are stressed on the first 
syllable: 
      'manifest  'scientist  'impotent  'argument  'applicant 
 
(g) Unstressed Heavy Penult 
      Many English words have antepenult stress although the penult is 
heavy: 
      'minister  'calendar  'passenger  'character 
 
(h) Contrastive Stress  
    In English words which can be used as either a verb or a noun, 
stress tends to fall on the first syllable of the noun but on the 
second syllable of the verb.  This can be practised in separate 
contexts, as follows: 
 

Teaching Suggestions  
 
 
213 
- Stress shift in words: 
NOUN 
 
           VERB 
'contrast  
           con'trast 
'desert 
 
           de'sert 
'present 
 
           pre'sent 
'subject 
 
           sub'ject 
 
- Contextual practice: 
The 'desert is hot and dry. 
Rats de'sert the sinking ship. 
This book is a 'present from my brother. 
I have to pre'sent a paper at the meeting. 
 
(2) Teachers can explain to their students the following relationship between 
syllable weight (rime structure) and main stress in English, as follows:   
 
(a) In many English nouns and suffixed adjectives, the penult is 
stressed if it is heavy and the antepenult is stressed if the penult is 
light: 
     a'genda de'fender com'puter pro'tective diag'nostic  
     'marathon 'manager 'memory 'medical gra'mmatical 
(b) In many English verbs and unsuffixed adjectives, the final syllable 
is stressed, if it is heavy and the penult is stressed if the final 
syllable is light: 
      pro'vide   pre'vail    pro'tect       ro'bust   po'lite  
      de'liver    de'velop   de'molish  'solid      'oral 
 
(3) The cases of unexpected non-transfer in Chapter 4: Results and 
Analysis indicate a major role for item-by-item learning (lexical 
acquisition), familiarity and analogy, teachers should focus on stress 
position when they introduce important/high frequency vocabulary 
items and correct their stress errors early to avoid fossilisation.  
 
(4) Teachers can explain to their students that correct stressing of English 
words is as important as correct pronunciation of consonant and vowel 
sounds. Furthermore, Arabic learners should memorise new English 
words with their stress patterns because English word stress does not 
have orthographic representation. 
 
(5) Teachers can make use of transfer facilitative effect (i.e. positive 
transfer) while teaching students English items with stress similar to 
Arabic.      

Chapter Five 
 
 
214
(6) Teachers can point out some common rules of English stress such as: 
• 
Many common nouns and adjectives have stress on the first 
syllable: 
 
'water,  'woman,  'pretty,  'ugly,  'table 
• 
Many suffixes cause the syllable before them to be stressed: 
 
-iar 
fa'miliar               -ible 
'terrible 
 
-ic 
a'tomic  
 -ify 
'beautify 
 
-ity 
co'mmunity 
 -ive 
pro'gressive 
 
• 
It is very common for compound nouns to have stress on the first 
element: 
 
'blackbird  
'chairman     
'greenhouse 
 
'hotdog 
 
'sunset           
'teamwork 
 
(7) Teachers can train their students to use English Dictionaries with 
pronunciation guidance, such as the Oxford Advanced Learner’s 
Dictionary and the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English, 
both for classwork and homework. Furthermore, students should be 
encouraged to prepare their own dictionaries or word lists with the 
stress correctly marked. 
 
(8) Teachers can demonstrate what we mean by a stress pattern in English 
through the pronunciation of the names of class members, place names, 
names of famous people and well-known landmarks.  After naming 
each item, teachers can establish the correct stress pattern, then shift 
the stress to the wrong syllable and back again to the correct one. 
 
(9) To facilitate English stress rules for Arab learners, teachers can arrange 
groups of English words according to stress patterns.  Students can 
then be asked to add more words in the appropriate group once the 
model has been practised:  
 
    •  Two-syllable Words: Primary stress on the second syllable:  
 
 
    a'broad   be'cause   com'pare   de'cay 
 
    •  Three-syllable Words: Primary stress on the first syllable: 
 
 
    'accident   'beautiful   'calculate    'delicate 
 
    •  Three-syllable Words: Primary stress on the second syllable: 
 
 
    ad'vantage   col'lection   de'cision en   'courage 
 
    •  Three-syllable Words: Primary stress on the third syllable: 
 
 
    disap'pear   engi'neer   repre'sent   under'stand  
 

Teaching Suggestions  
 
 
215 
(10) Teachers can prepare stress exercises in the light of errors in English 
word stress due to MT (Arabic) interference.  The following points can 
be taken into consideration. 
• 
Teachers can train students to often stress the first syllable of 
English words ending in a long vowel or a diphthong such as: 
 
'igloo   i'dentify   'beautify   'cargo   'holiday       
• 
Teachers can train students to often stress the first syllable of 
English words ending in a long vowel or diphthong plus a 
consonant such as: 
 
'multitude   'capitalise   'criticise   'telegraph   'telescope          
  
• 
Teachers can train students to often stress the first syllable of 
English words ending in a vowel plus two consonants such as:    
       'scientist    'punishment    'product   'concept   'applicant   
• 
Teachers can train students to often stress the second syllable of 
English words having the syllabic structure CVCVCV(C): 
 
pa'cific   ter'rific   de'posit   so'licit   ho'rrific    
• 
Teachers can train students not to stress the penultimate syllable in 
English words stressed on the antepenult such as: 
 
'silently   'barrister   'messenger   'calendar   'passenger               
• 
Teachers can train students not to stress the antepenultimate 
syllable in English words stressed on the pre-antepenult such as: 
 
'accuracy   'category   'matrimony   'mercenary   'necessary                        
 
(11) Learners can be asked to identify the stressed syllables using 
sequences of nonsense syllables (e.g. la la LA la la LA la). 
 
(12) Learners can indicate the correct stress patterns of words by clapping, 
using louder claps for the stressed syllables. 
 
(13) Working in pairs, one learner can read a scripted dialogue while the 
other learner marks the stress patterns on a printed copy. 
 
(14) Learners can give a short talk to the class on topics related to the 
lesson.  They are assessed on correct production and on evidence of 
self-monitoring of word stress. 
 
(15) Teachers can pronounce a list of words using both correct and 
incorrect word stress and ask the students to identify the correct 
versions.

5.2 General Recommendations 
(1) The importance of the teacher’s pronunciation cannot be over 
emphasised.  The Arab teacher of English who wants his students to 
produce the foreign language words accurately should first ensure that 
his pronunciation is not defective.  Besides correct, accurate and clear 
pronunciation, the teacher of English should have knowledge of the 
sound system of both English as a target language and the mother 
tongue (Arabic) so that he can find examples of comparison, and be 
able to predict and remedy the areas of difficulty of his students’ 
pronunciation. 
 
 
 
Unless the teacher’s production of English phonemes is correct, his 
students may develop wrong habits which become difficult to eradicate. 
Leeson (1979, 15) mentions that ‘Where there are phonological defects of 
a marked degree, it is difficult to accept that such a person can be truly 
fluent’. Malmberg (1963, 109) also states that ‘Without a thorough 
knowledge of the phonetics of the two languages concerned, the language 
teacher will never succeed in teaching his pupils a perfect pronunciation of 
the new language’. 
 
(2) Teachers can try to persuade Arab learners of the importance of good 
pronunciation for ease of communication and try also to increase their 
motivation and concern for good pronunciation.  In addition, teachers 
should try to increase learners’ exposure to authentic spoken English. 
 
(3) Teachers can draw learners’ attention to the pronunciation problems 
arising from mother tongue interference and methods of surmounting 
them. For example, pronouncing English initial /p/ unaspirated or as /b/ 
or pronouncing English /v/ as /f/. 
 
(4) Predictable pronunciation errors should receive the teachers’ 
immediate and full attention, including intensive remedial work if 
necessary because it is difficult to eradicate wrong pronunciation later 
on. The initial stage of learning is crucial for picking up correct stress, 
intonation and pronunciation of the foreign language. 
 
(5) Teachers can lead students to repeat correct models of pronunciation 
with understanding rather than imitating parrot fashion. 
 

Teaching Suggestions  
 
 
217 
(6) Teachers can listen carefully for students’ acceptable reproduction of 
sounds and for detection and correction of new errors. 
 
(7) Teaching materials can include remedial tasks for dealing with 
predicted errors arising from MT (Arabic) interference.  Teachers can 
teach the sound in relation to its most common spellings.  For example, 
the sound /s/ can be represented as follows:  
s 
sit, sun, bus 
ss 
class, lesson, dress 
se 
horse, house, worse 
c 
bicycle, exercise, cinema 
ce 
policeman, face, office 
 
Similarly, the sound /ܼ/ can be represented as follows: 
i 
fish, finger, hill 
y 
baby, easy, family 
e 
begin, market, pocket 
 
(8) Teachers can use visual aids such as diagrams and charts that clarify 
the articulatory processes involved in making sounds.  This can help 
students gain greater accuracy in pronunciation.  For example, the face 
diagram can be used to illustrate sounds such as: 
/݇,ð/ 
       with the tongue between the teeth 
/p, b, m/ 
with the lips completely closed 
clear /l/        with the front of the tongue relatively high 
dark /ܽ/ 
with the back of the tongue relatively high 
 
(9) Students can use mirrors to see the shape of the lips and the mouth and 
tongue placement. 
 
(10) Teachers can test their students’ perception of English sounds by 
using a tape-based activity including different exercises such as: ‘Write 
the word you hear’; ‘Which sound?’; ‘Same or different?’ and ‘Odd 
one out?’. 
 
(11) After listening to the recorded voices of native speakers of English 
pronouncing groups of words and phrases, students can form an idea of 
the auditory image of the printed text.  Then the students can record 
their own voices and compare their pronunciation with that of the 
native voice.

(12) Teachers can make use of dictation.  This can help in listening and 
spelling. 
 
(13) Teachers can train their students to pronounce the difficult English 
sounds in different positions:  initially, medially and finally. 
 
(14) Teachers can correct pronunciation errors immediately because it is 
difficult to eradicate incorrect pronunciation later on (fossilisation). 
 
(15) Teachers can develop students’ acquisition of the phonetic habits of 
the new language (English) and protect these habits against 
interference from the habits of the native language (Arabic).  
 
(16) Teachers can encourage students to use single sounds in words and in 
connected speech. 
 
(17) Teachers can explain to students the difference between the various 
English sounds and between English sounds and Arabic sounds.

APPENDIX B 
FACTORS AFFECTING PRONUNCIATION 
MASTERY AND ARAB LEARNERS OF ENGLISH  
 
 
 
Difficulties in speaking often refer to pronunciation. Pronunciation 
includes the articulation of individual sounds and the distinctive features 
of sounds like voicing and aspiration and stress and intonation. Correct 
pronunciation is a means of achieving a confident grasp of the spoken 
language and can help in normal communication, particularly 
intelligibility (Derwing and Munro, 2005). Although native speakers 
cannot explain their language patterns and rules, they are able to indicate 
which ones are permitted. Second language learners need to develop these 
same intuitions.         
 
Research has contributed some important data on factors that can influence 
the learning and teaching of pronunciation skills. Being able to correctly 
perceive and produce the spoken form is only one of these. Ellis (1985), 
Graham (1994), Pennington (1994) and Kenworthy (1987) discuss the 
following factors: 
 
(1) The native language: Most researchers agree that interference from 
the learner’s native language (NL) influences his pronunciation of the 
target language (TL). This is reflected in his foreign accent which 
carries some of his native sound characteristics and stress rules. The 
greater the differences between the (NL) and the (TL), the greater the 
likelihood of pronunciation errors occurring at both segmental and 
suprasegmental level. 
 
(2) Amount of exposure: The amount of the learner’s exposure to English 
is a necessary factor for the development of his pronunciation skills.  A 
learner living in a non-English-speaking country using and practising 
his English will make more progress than one living in an English-
speaking country and not practising it.

251
(3) Age: There is a debate over the impact of age on learning 
pronunciation. Most researchers, however, agree that pronunciation is 
more difficult for adults than for children and that adults probably will 
not achieve native-like pronunciation. Usually, if the learner began to 
speak the second language before the age of six, there will be little or 
no accent.  If the learner began to speak between the ages of seven and 
11, the learner is likely to have a slight accent.  If the learner began to 
speak after the age of 12, then there is almost always an accent.     
     
(4) Phonetic ability: Having a ‘good ear’ for foreign languages is very 
important for pronunciation mastery. Researchers have shown that 
some people have greater ability to discriminate between and mimic 
sounds than others. 
 
(5) Prior pronunciation instruction: Previous pronunciation instruction 
may affect learners’ achievement of current efforts. More advanced 
learners may have developed some habitual pronunciation errors that 
should be identified and corrected. 
 
(6) Aptitude: Some researchers believe all learners have the same 
capacity to learn a second language because they have learned a first 
language. Others assert that the ability to recognise and make foreign 
sounds may be unequally developed in different learners. 
 
(7) Attitude and identity: Non-linguistic factors related to an individual’s 
personality and learning goals can influence achievement in 
pronunciation. Learners who show positive feelings towards the 
speakers of the new language tend to develop more accurate native-like 
accents. In addition, a person’s ‘sense of identity’ is a strong 
determiner of the acquisition of accurate pronunciation of a foreign 
language. 
 
(8) Concern and motivation: Strength of concern for pronunciation is a 
kind of ‘achievement motivation’.  Learners who are concerned and 
motivated will achieve more than those who are not. A young doctor 
who knows he will be more respected and possibly promoted if his 
pronunciation improves is likely to pay more attention to direct 
pronunciation instruction. 
 
One or more of these factors may affect the pronunciation accuracy of the 
Arab learners. The key is to be aware of their existence so that they may 
be borne in mind when setting realistic and effective pronunciation goals

and development plans for them. Teaching and training can have an effect 
on some of these factors but not all, as follows.   
 
• 
The native language: Having a good knowledge of the sound systems 
and stress rules of both the (NL) and the (TL) can enable the teacher 
and learner to pay particular attention to those errors due to 
interference (i.e. L1 negative transfer).  
 
• 
Age: Obviously, we cannot change the Arab learner’s age. However, 
the sooner, the better for the Arab learner to learn L2 English taking 
into consideration the Critical Period Hypothesis (CPH).      
 
• 
Amount of exposure: We can increase the Arab learner’s exposure to 
English to a certain degree as follows: 
 
a) Having classroom contact with native speakers of English. 
b) Forming an after-school English Club to enable learners to practise     
English in a social context. 
c) Encouraging education exchange programmes between Arabic and 
English speaking countries. 
d) Using teaching materials recorded by native speakers of English. 
e) Occasionally teaching other subjects through English. 
 
• 
Phonetic ability: We cannot change the raw phonetic ability of the 
Arab learners. But we can help them utilise this ability to the full by 
giving them a better chance to distinguish between and imitate the 
foreign language sounds. 
 
• 
Prior pronunciation instruction: We can provide good pronunciation 
instruction for the Arab learners from the outset to avoid pronunciation 
errors and correct persistent ones before becoming fossilised. 
 
• 
Aptitude: We can try to develop the Arab learner’s ability for 
recognition and production of the foreign language sounds. 
 
• 
Attitude and identity: We can try to encourage the Arab learner to 
have positive feelings towards the speakers of English, their customs 
and culture.  Above all, we can explain to him that mastering English 
pronunciation does not mean losing his Arab identity. 
 
• 
Concern and motivation: We can try to increase the Arab learner’s 
motivation and concern for good pronunciation as follows. 
a) by persuading him of the need for good pronunciation as a means of 
easy communication;

b) by showing interest in his pronunciation and progress in it; 
c) by emphasising that intelligibility and communicative efficiency are 
the main goals and a ‘native-like’ accent is desirable.
