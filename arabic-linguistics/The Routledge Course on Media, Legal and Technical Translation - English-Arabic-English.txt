LEGAL AND TECHNICAL TRANSLATION 
The Routledge Course on Media, Legal and Technical Translation: English-Arabic-
English is an indispensable and engaging coursebook for university students 
wishing to develop their English-Arabic-English translation skills in these three text 
types. Taking a practical approach, the book introduces Arab translation students to 
common translation strategies in addition to the linguistic, syntactic, and stylistic 
features of media, legal, and technical texts. This book features texts carefully 
selected for their technical relevance. The key features include: 
• 
four comprehensive chapters covering media, legal, and technical texts, which 
are of immense importance to Arab translation students; 
• 
detailed and clear explanations of the lexical, syntactic, and stylistic features of 
English and Arabic media, legal, and technical texts; 
• 
up-to-date and practical translation examples in both directions offering students 
actual experiences of professional translators; 
• 
authentic texts extracted from various sources to promote students’ familiarity 
with language features and use; 
• 
an extensive range of exercises following each section of the book to enable 
students to test and practice the knowledge and skills they developed from 
reading previous sections; 
• 
glossaries following most exercises containing the translation of difﬁcult words; 
and 
• 
a list of recommended readings following each chapter. 
The easy, practical, and comprehensive approach adopted in the book makes it a 
must-have coursebook for intermediate and advanced students studying translation 
between English and Arabic. University instructors and professional translators 
working on translation between English and Arabic will ﬁnd this book particularly 
useful. 
Mahmoud Altarabin is an assistant professor of translation and linguistics at 
the Department of English, Islamic University of Gaza. He designs and teaches 
translation courses for undergraduates and postgraduates.

 FOREWORD 
Mahmoud Altarabin’s book  The Routledge Course on Media, Legal and Techni­
cal Translation: English-Arabic-English constitutes a considerable achievement, 
having been written under extremely difﬁcult circumstances for Palestine and the 
Palestinians. Since 2006, Israel has placed Gaza, where Mahmoud Altarabin lives 
and works, under an ever-tightening siege, reducing it to a situation that both the 
United Nations and Save the Children have described as “unlivable,” while the 
2020 Trump-Kushner-Netanyahu “peace plan” intends to cut up what remains of 
East Jerusalem and the West Bank into desiccated, economically unviable frag­
ments of land. 
The Routledge Course on Media, Legal and Technical Translation: English­
Arabic-English is a welcome addition to the growing number of practically ori­
ented works on Arabic-English translation, including three previously published by 
Routledge: Thinking Arabic Translation ( Dickins, Hervey, & Higgins, 2017 , 2nd 
edn.), Arabic-English-Arabic Translation: Issues and Strategies ( Husni & New­
man, 2015 ), and  Arabic-English-Arabic Legal Translation (El-Farahaty, 2014). 
The Routledge Course on Media, Legal and Technical Translation nicely 
complements these other Routledge books in a number of ways. Thinking Arabic 
Translation is a general coursebook aimed principally at English native-speaking 
undergraduate students, and is concerned exclusively with Arabic>English transla­
tion, whereas The Routledge Course on Media, Legal and Technical Translation is 
aimed principally at Arab university students and covers both Arabic>English and 
English>Arabic translation. Arabic-English-Arabic Translation: Issues and Strate­
gies explores a number of topics in relation to Arabic>English and English>Arabic 
translation with some exercise material, whereas The Routledge Course on Media, 
Legal and Technical Translation is a coursebook with extensive practical translation 
exercises. Arabic-English-Arabic Legal Translation is speciﬁcally focused on the 
technicalities of legal translation, whereas The Routledge Course on Media, Legal 

 
 
 
 
xii Foreword 
and Technical Translation, although it includes legal translation, sites this within a 
broader translation context covering other genres. 
The Routledge Course on Media, Legal and Technical Translation is clearly struc­
tured and easy to use for tutors and students alike. Essential translation notions are 
provided in Chapter 1 , while  Chapters 2 – 4 deal with news translation, legal transla­
tion, and technical and scientiﬁc translation respectively – areas chosen because of 
their particular importance for professional translation in the Arab world. Students 
of Arabic>English translation will ﬁnd this a very useful book.

 INTRODUCTION 
There is extensive literature on translation issues between English and Arabic cov­
ering various text genres. Master and doctoral theses on translation between this 
language pair are beyond number. Many of the translation books taught at the Arab 
university level disregard the bidirectional practical approach, which primarily aims 
to develop students’ translation skills in Arabic and English. Some translation text­
books contain valuable information on general translation issues, and others are 
only collections of instructors’ class materials. 
The academic question that can be asked here is: How can this book be beneﬁ­
cial to translation students? The present book does not intend to be an encyclopedic 
coursebook on translation between English and Arabic, simply because no book can. 
It is designed to address key issues related to the translation of media, legal, 
and technical texts that are of considerable signiﬁcance to Arab university students, 
instructors, and professional translators. 
Aim of the book 
The Routledge Course on Media, Legal and Technical Translation is designed to 
offer a bidirectional account of media, legal, and technical translation between 
English and Arabic. It provides a detailed analysis of the deﬁning lexical, syntactic, 
and stylistic features of the three text genres in English and Arabic. Entirely practi­
cal in its approach, the book is the ﬁrst coursebook to address such a unique col­
lection of text genres coupled with highly academic and practical content. It thus 
provides a valuable resource to students, instructors, translation professionals, and 
researchers engaged in translation between English and Arabic. 
There are three main considerations for selecting the collection of text genres that 
the book contains and the bidirectional approach to translation. First, the texts types 
are believed to be the most in-demand translation texts in the Arab world not only 

 
 
 
 
  
  
  
 
Introduction xv 
for academics, students, and translators but also for institutions. Second, translation 
professionals rarely translate in one direction and therefore need a textbook that 
provides a bidirectional account on a certain text type. Third, translation students 
are often driven by the need to test their skills by translating between two languages. 
The book features a practical selection of English and Arabic translation exer­
cises on media, legal, and technical texts followed by glossaries or annotations to 
draw readers’ attention to the accurate rendering of certain words, phrases, or sen­
tences. The exercises contained in the book provide real-life translation tasks that 
students, instructors, and translators usually come across. 
Book structure 
The advantage of dividing the book into four main topics lies in giving the readers 
complete freedom to focus on any of the four topics in the order of their choice as 
determined by their individual needs or course outline. The structure of the book 
makes it suitable for classroom use as well as home study. 
Chapter 1 introduces students to basic concepts in translation. These include 
translation, equivalence, translation strategies, translation shifts, language variation 
when translating, criteria for good translation, and translators’ tools. 
Chapter 2 provides an account of key concepts in media translation, including 
translation as rewriting, ideology and media, ideology and translation, transedit­
ing, and translators in conﬂict zones. The chapter then comprehensively presents 
the lexical, syntactic, and stylistic features of English and Arabic news texts. It also 
presents newspaper sections and concludes with exercises in both directions on cur­
rent issues. 
Chapter 3  focuses on the translation of legal texts between English and Arabic. 
The chapter is broadly divided into three parts. Part 1 familiarizes readers with the 
concept of legal translation, areas of difﬁculty in translating legal texts, and clas­
siﬁcation of legal translation and legal texts. Part 2 provides a detailed analysis of 
the lexical and syntactic features of legal discourse in English and Arabic. This aims 
to develop students’ linguistic competence, which they need to demonstrate in the 
following section. Part 3 is the practical section of the chapter. It contains transla­
tion exercises on different English and Arabic legal texts. These include contracts, 
agreements, partnerships, tenders, among others. A remarkable feature of this chap­
ter and the book is the inclusion of Sharia court documents with sample translations 
of some texts and other non-Sharia court documents from different Arab countries. 
Chapter 4 is designed to train translation students on translating technical and sci­
entiﬁc texts. The chapter begins with an outline of the lexical and syntactic features 
of technical texts and the translation strategies used in rendering these texts. The 
text types included in the chapter are ﬁnance and business texts, agriculture texts, 
medical texts, and technology and industry texts.

TRANSLATION: BASIC CONCEPTS 
AND DEFINITIONS 
1.1 What is translation? 
It is commonplace to begin a translation course with deﬁning basic concepts such as 
translation, equivalence, and translation strategies to develop readers’ awareness of 
such basic concepts in the translation industry. Translation refers to a “process” of 
“rendering” a text into another language ( Simpson & Weiner, 1989 ) where translators 
take deﬁnite actions to achieve their task. It can also mean “reproducing” a “natu­
ral equivalent” of a source language (SL) message ( Nida & Taber, 1969 ) taking into 
consideration the target language (TL) norms that aim for naturalness. Reproducing a 
natural equivalent text into a TL, whether English or Arabic, can be a challenging task 
for a number of factors, as shown in section 1.2. Additionally, translation is deﬁned as 
the “replacement” of a text by an “equivalent text” ( Catford, 1965 ); “interpretation of 
verbal signs” into another language ( Steiner, 1975 ), and producing texts that account 
for target readers’ circumstances ( Vermeer, 1987 ). The concept of translating is some­
times linked to more complex paratextual elements as the intention of the ST author 
( Newmark, 1988 ) and the sociocultural context ( Hatim & Munday, 2004 ) or what 
means “to explain ﺗﺮ

Toury (1995 ) calls cultural traditions. In Arabic,

another language” ( Al-Basha, 1992 , p. 253).  
as “explained it.” Naturally, one cannot expect one deﬁnition to be an ideal match for 
a wide range of contexts, languages, purposes, and readership. Brislin and Freimanis 
(2001 , p. 39) maintain that “The goal of translation is to achieve linguistic, cultural 
and psychological equivalence and judging its quality is a great concern, especially 
since there are no speciﬁc criteria to guide that process.” Newmark (1991 , p. 1) says: 
Translation is concerned with moral and with factual truth. This truth can be 
effectively rendered only if it is grasped by the reader, and that is the purpose 
and the end of translation. Should it be grasped readily, or only after some 
effort? That is a problem of means and occasions.

Figure 1.1 summarizes the key concepts of translation deﬁnitions, which are central 
components in the translation process. 
Need for translation 
The profound multidimensional signiﬁcance of translation throughout history lies 
in not only providing foundations for global interaction but also enabling different 
countries to promote interactive relationships aiming at advancements in technol­
ogy, politics, trade, and peace. Being a traditional means of communication, transla­
tion promotes transmitting knowledge and protects cultural heritage. Toury (1995 ) 
maintains that the value behind translation is based on two elements: (1) being a 
text and occupying a position in a certain language and culture and (2) constituting 
a representation in that language or culture of another. In her  Why Translation Mat­
ters, Grossman (2010 , pp. x–ix) says: 
Translation not only plays its important traditional role as the means that allows 
us to access literature originally written in one of the countless languages we 

 
 
 
 
 
 
Basic concepts and deﬁ nitions 3 
cannot read, but it also represents a concrete literary presence with the crucial 
capacity to ease and make more meaningful our relationships to those with 
whom we may not have had a connection before. Translation always helps us 
to know, to see from a different angle, to attribute new value to what once may 
have been unfamiliar. 
Translation protects literature and promotes the understanding of the other. In the 
present fast-paced world, spreading news, academic literature, medical advances, 
scientiﬁc innovations, and other aspects of knowledge is only possible through 
translation. On a country level, translation can promote external affairs and boost 
the tourism sector, which can include public or private bodies. As we shall see in 
Chapter 2 , translation, however, is an ideal tool for self-presentation and denial of 
the other through ideologically motivated rewritings of news stories. Additionally, 
legal documents between individuals or states are usually translated when the par­
ties to these agreements speak different languages. It should thus be highlighted 
that translation serves different purposes, texts, and people. Without such a must-
activity, the world could remain disconnected areas. 
1.2 Equivalence: an illusion 
There has been no consensus on translation equivalence, which has encouraged a 
continuous debate among translation theorists for decades. The concept is linked 
to complex factors beyond simply replacing words. Nida (1964 ) introduced formal 
equivalence focusing on SL message form and content and dynamic equivalence 
aiming at an “equivalent effect.” Practically, formal equivalence between Arabic 
and English does not pose a challenge unlike the dynamic equivalence because the 
chances of achieving the latter heavily rely on paralinguistic factors. This is reﬂected 
in Catford’s (1965 ) argument that TL translation equivalents are a central problem 
of translation activity.  Newmark (1981 ) argues that translation equivalence is use­
less and that “perfect translation is illusionary” ( 1991 ).  Biguenet and Schulte (1989 ) 
and Baker (2018 ) stress the impossibility of achieving exact equivalence between 
any language pair.  Baker (2018 ),  Koller (1995 ),  Ivir (1996 ),  House (1997 ),  Snell-
Hornby (1988 ),  Bassnett (2002 ),  Hatim and Munday (2004 ), and  Fawcett (1997 ) 
maintain that linguistic and cultural factors make equivalence relative. Venuti (1995 ) 
believes that translation causes violent effects at home and abroad. He highlights the 
massive power of translation in constructing national identities for foreign cultures 
and points out that translation potentially ﬁgures in ethnic discrimination, geopoliti­
cal confrontations, colonialism, terrorism, and war. 
On the intralingual level, ﬁnding two words bearing the same meaning in all 
contexts is “a luxury a language can do without” ( Jackson, 1988 , p. 65). Although 
a language can express certain meanings using a limited number of words, another 
may express the same with a larger number ( Biguenet & Schulte, 1989 ), which 
points to non-equivalence at the linguistic level. Broeck (1978 ) explains that a strict 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
4 Basic concepts and deﬁ nitions 
equivalence relationship does not apply to translation. Lack of equivalence can be 
attributed to lexical, syntactic, or pragmatic differences between different languages 
that makes it difﬁcult to provide perfect guidelines to deal with various types of non­
equivalence ( Baker, 2018 ). Differences in the components and relations of meaning 
between a pair of languages can lead to two consequences for translation as well 
as equivalence issues ( Fawcett, 1997 ). Being the basis for any translation practice 
that heavily relies on equivalence relations, meaning is usually determined through 
situation and context rather than through the dictionary. Meaning can also be gov­
erned by translators’ interference in transferring texts between a pair of languages. 
Regardless of the debate on the practicality of translation equivalence, no translation 
practice is expected to take place without exploring corresponding TL lexical units. 
Differences between an SL text and its extra-textual elements and those of the TL 
control the level of equivalence relativity. 
Equivalence and translation 
Problems of translation equivalence appear at different language levels and in dif­
ferent text domains. A word can have different meanings depending on the context 
. It canورﯾﺚ
 or
,ﻣﺴﺄﻟﺔ
 ,
إﺻﺪار
 ,ﯾ
ُﺼﺪر
 
 ,which can mean
issue
of its occurrence as in 
ﻣﻨﺨﻔﺾ
 in psychology,  ﻛﺂﺑﺔ
 or اﻧﻬﯿﺎر
 can mean
Depression
(relative). ﻗﺮﯾﺐ
 also mean 
 in economics. This highlights the immense رﻛﻮد
 or ﻛﺴﺎد
 in weather forecast, and 
signiﬁcance of context awareness in determining the speciﬁc and intended meaning 
of a word. 
Another source of difﬁculty that can affect the selection of appropriate equiva­
which can be translated  ﯾﺒﺪأlents is attributed to lexical relations. Consider the word 
into English as start, begin, or commence. These have similar meanings, but each 
is used in a different context and each has a different antonym. The difﬁculty here 
,
start
into English. Shall we translate it as  ﯾﺒﺪأarises when translating the word 
which is used to denote physical activity; begin, which does not mainly denote a 
physical activity; or commence, which is used in formal contexts like court pro-
he began
is less formal as in
Begin
.ﯾﺮﻓﻊ
 
دﻋﻮى
 commence a lawsuit
ceedings as in 
. ﺑﺪأ
اﻟﺘﺤﺪث
 talking 
Lexical gaps pose another challenge that requires careful consideration. These 
do not always reﬂect that an SL word is not understood in the TL, as in the case of 
bedsit, which refers to a one-room ﬂat used as a living room, kitchen, and bedroom. 
The term exists in Arabic but has no equivalent word. It can be paraphrased into 
, a British cultural item referring to a

 Arabic. However, it can be explained into Arabic, as  
is an Arabic cultural example that is completely absent in English. Translating the 
word as seclusion does not render the meaning of the SL word for the absence of any 
clear religious reference. In addition, the word cannot be translated as seclusion in a 
mosque because there could be other people in the mosque as the case in the last ten

days of Ramadan. The term can be translated using transliteration and paraphrase as 
Iʿtikāf (staying in mosque for worship). 
Certain words in the economic or technical domain have no direct equivalents in 
Arabic despite their being familiar.  Bottleneck, which refers to anything that delays 
progress, especially in business and industry, can only be translated through para­
, which refers to a group

Translators’ attention should be drawn here to the fact that nonspecialized English-
Arabic dictionaries may provide inaccurate translations of domain-speciﬁc terms.

 An example from Islamic economics is the word

ﬁnance different kinds of projects such as housing and construction of buildings. It 
is an Islamic term referring to the wait-ﻋﺪة

ing period that a divorced woman or widow must observe before marrying another 
man. Rendering the term simply as waiting period without highlighting the speciﬁc 
meaning results in a translation loss. A practical procedure for translating the term 
includes borrowing and explanation. 
Despite its signiﬁcance, equivalence remains a relative debatable concept, 
achieving which is governed by linguistic and cultural factors. English and Ara­
bic are two distinct languages linguistically and culturally and one naturally 
expects to encounter difﬁculties in rendering various levels and types of texts 
between this language pair. Although it is sometimes impossible to think of 
equivalence when the ST lexical unit is completely absent in the TL, a translator 
can employ different methods to render or explain a term or concept to target 
readership. 
1.3 Translation strategies 
The different text types, purpose of translation, and translators’ competence sig­
niﬁcantly inﬂuence the whole translation process and make it difﬁcult or even 
impossible to adopt one translation strategy to render various text types. Certain 
text genres may require communicative translation; others need literal translation, 
whereas certain lexical units require paraphrase, borrowing, or couplets. Pym (1992, 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
6 Basic concepts and deﬁ nitions 
p. 174 quoted in Hatim, 2014 , p. 99) lists the restrictions on selecting one translation 
strategy rather than another: 
1 
Why do we translate in the ﬁrst place, and which text should we translate when 
we decide to translate? 
2 
How will a particular type of translation be recognized for what it is once it is 
made available to us? 
3 
If it can be assumed that extratextual factors are involved, and that these are 
beyond the translator’s control, whose control are they under? 
4 
What role does the paratext (notes, interpolations, etc.) play in our choice of 
translation strategy? 
Let us now examine the translation strategies commonly adopted when translating 
between English and Arabic. 
Literal translation 
Despite its practicality in speciﬁc translation activities, literal translation has long 
been considered a source-text-biased strategy. Broadly speaking, literal translation 
and free translation are the two main skills in translation ( Hassan, 2014 , p. 12). 
The author explains that while literal translation, or what Munday (2016 ) calls 
word-for-word translation, aims to translate the source text while adequately keep­
ing the form and structure unchanged, free translation is an accurate rendering 
of the source text where little attention is paid to form and structure. The ﬁnal 
version of a text translated freely is ﬂuent and accurate. Translators should take 
into consideration that free translation does not give them the freedom to add or 
delete information that can affect the overall meaning of the text.  Dickins, Hervey, 
and Higgins (2017 , p. 14) state that the standard grammar and word order of the 
English language must be respected. To them, literal translation involves gram­
matical transposition replacing ST grammatical units by other grammatical units 
may be useful in rendering words out of context where all possible meanings of 
such words are provided. Despite its usefulness, literal translation remains subject 
to certain limitations. 
Constraints on literal translation 
Strict adherence to rendering texts literally can violate TL norms in addition to 
distorting the meaning of ST units. Considering that literal translation is generally 
equated with word-for-word translation, translators may render one word at a time 
اﻟﺪﻧﯿﺎ
 
ﺷﻤﺲ
 An example of such grammatical transposition is translating
in the TT. 
(lit. the world) is translated into the empty/ اﻟﺪﻧﯿﺎ

in the same order instead of translating phrases or larger units according to the TL 
norms. Let us examine the problems of literal translation here:

Semantic and communicative translation 
Newmark (1981 ) argues that communicative translation focuses on the effect of 
translation on the target readers whereas semantic translation focuses on rendering 
texts according to the syntactic and semantic structures of the TL.  Dickins et al. 
(2017 , p. 14) point out that communicative translation, which resembles free trans­
lation, is used when the ST uses an SL expression in a speciﬁc situation and the TT 
uses a TL expression in an equivalent target language situation. The authors provide 
the following examples of communicative translation (pp. 14–15):

Free translation 
When adopting free translation, which is usually TL biased, translators are at liberty 
to render STs, maintaining the content of the ST message ( Newmark, 1988 ) and 
disregarding its form. An example of free translation is translating the Arabic collo-

nicative translation of let bygones be bygones sounds like an idiomatic translation, 
which, in essence, is not different from free translation and communicative transla­
tion. The classiﬁcation here is a label attached to the translation.

Adaptation 
Adaptation primarily aims to preserve the spirit of the ST when cultural differences 
between the ST and the TT come to the surface. It is a form of translation that is 
mainly used with some genres such as drama ( Bastin, 2009 ) and is the “freest” type 
of translation used in translating plays ( Newmark, 1988 ). This type of translation 
preserves themes, characters, and plots and converts the SL culture to the TL culture. 
Translators adopt this translation strategy when the source text contains something 
speciﬁc to the source language culture to be expressed in a completely different way 
that is familiar to the culture of the target language. Adaptation is therefore a shift 
in cultural environment. 
The following is an example of the translation of Shakespeare’s  Othello into Ara­
bic by Khalil Mutran: 
RODERIGO 
Tush! never tell me; I take it much unkindly 
That thou, Iago, who hast had my purse 
As if the strings were thine, shouldst know of this.

Translation by addition 
Translation by addition strategy simply refers to adding something, not present in 
the ST, to the TT ( Dickins et al., 2017 ). This strategy is commonly used when trans­
lating from Arabic into English as in adding the word  days to the English translation 
 making it “since the days of the Turkish hegemony” (Dickins et  ﻣﻨﺬ
اﻟﻬﯿﻤﻨﺔ
 
اﻟﺘﺮﻛﯿﺔ
 of 
al., 2017, p. 21). Another example is the translation of  maternity wear into Arabic

 The word
. ﻣﯿﺎه
ﺻﺎﻟﺤﺔ
 
ﻟﻠﺸﺮب
 is translated into Arabic as

ﬁt) is added to the Arabic translation. 
Translation by omission 
Contrary to translation by addition, translation by omission refers to deleting ST 
lexical units from the TT.  Dickins et al. (2017 , p. 20) explain that “the most obvious 
form of translation loss is when something that occurs in the ST is simply omit­
, used to introduce information related و ﻫﺬاted from the TT.” The Arabic phrase  
to a previous textual material, is usually omitted when we translate into English. 
Another example of translation by omission is rendering air trafﬁc control systems 
 is omitted from the TT.

Paraphrase 
Translators adopt this translation strategy to paraphrase an ST in the TT when the 
concept expressed by the source item is lexicalized in the target language in a dif­
ferent format ( Baker, 2018 , p. 38). An example of this strategy provided by Baker is 
the paraphrasing of creamy in: 
The rich and creamy Kolestral-Super is easy to apply and has a pleasant 
fragrance. 
Target text (Arabic): 
ﻛﻮﻟﺴﺘﺮال
 
ﺳﻮﺑﺮ
ﻏﻨﻲ

ﯾﺸﺒﮫ
 
اﻟﻜﺮﯾﻤﺎت
 
 . . .
Kolestral-Super is rich and concentrated in its makeup, which gives a product that 
resembles cream . . . 
Another example of translation through paraphrase is the translation of print 
your name or type your name. The phrases are used in different types of applica­
tions. Print here means writing a person’s name by hand while  type3 means using 
a device to write one’s name. When translating the phrase into Arabic, translators 
and students should not confuse the distinct meanings of print and type. A third 
example is boldface, which does not have an Arabic equivalent word. The mean­
 ﻣﻖﻏﺎ ﺧﻂing of the word can be accounted for in Arabic through paraphrase as

Couplets and multiple strategies 
 Newmark (1988 , p. 91) deﬁned this strategy as using two procedures to deal with 
one problem. Consider the following examples: 
. In this example, borrowing, phonologicalاﻟﺒﺮوﻟﯿﺘﺎرﯾﺎ

This procedure can also apply to examples from Arabic into English as in: 
(a religiously sanctioned waiting period a Muslim woman must

observe after the death of her husband or divorce during which she may not 
marry). This is an example of a semantically complex word the translation of 
which requires detailed familiarity with Islamic terms. 
1.4 Language variation 
Language variation here refers to the regional variation that results in using differ­
ent lexical items to refer to one thing. This type of variation can pose challenges 
to translators who are strongly advised to take the target language setting into con­
sideration when rendering words that can have different equivalents in different 
countries. An English word can be translated differently in different Arab countries 
and, likewise, an Arabic word can have different equivalents in British English and 
American English. Consider the translations of district in four different Arab coun­
tries shown in Table 1.1. 
When translating district, translators are advised to consider the target lan­
guage readers and their region in order to account for the regional differences and

consequently render a natural translation. In addition, translators are also advised to 
account for the lexical differences between British English and American English. 
Consider the examples of Arabic lexical items and their translations into British 
English and American English shown in Table 1.2. 
1.5 Translation quality 
There are no unanimous criteria to judge the quality of a translation process or 
product due to linguistic and paralinguistic differences between the SL and TL, 
translators’ familiarity with SL and TL norms, text genres, purpose of translation, 
and commission. General guidelines that translators can follow ensure producing 
translations that meet the expectations for which translation processes are initiated. 
Understanding the source language and target language linguistic and cultural norms 
is a decisive factor in the process of translation. The thorough understanding of a 
source text linguistic and paralinguistic aspects enables translators to analyze the 
components of the text, use suitable translation methods, and consequently produce 
accurate translations according to the target language norms. Misunderstanding the 
ST can, in certain cases, lead to not only undesired results but also catastrophic 
consequences. 
Word-for-word, or literal, translation seems to be the ﬁrst strategy translation 
students adopt when rendering texts between English and Arabic, which can distort 
the meaning of original texts and produce odd target language texts. This strategy 
should not always be avoided because some ST units are only translatable through

tors to select certain alternatives that deﬁne the factors governing all aspects of the

translation process. Wilss (1996 ) points out that the decision-making process is, in 
a way, related to problem-solving strategies. The boundaries between both are dif­
ﬁcult to draw. Whereas problem solving can be thought of as an inclusive process, 
decision making begins only when the need for it arises within the structure of 
problem-solving operations. Quoting Corbin (1980), Wilss (1996 ) explains that it is 
necessary to present a standard procedural notion of decision making. The notion is 
based on six stages as follows: 
1 
Problem identiﬁcation 
2 
Problem clariﬁcation (description) 
3 
Research on, and collection of, background information 
4 
Deliberation of how to proceed (pre-choice behavior) 
5 
Moment of choice 
6 
Post-choice behavior (evaluation of translation results) 
Wilss argues that the decision-making procedure may be delayed by obstructions, 
which can occur at any stage. The author asks: 
What if a problem is not (sufﬁciently) clariﬁed in stage 2? How much infor­
mation collection is required in stage 3, before the translator dares to pro­
ceed further? What determines the length of deliberation in stage 4; when 
and why does a translator stop these deliberations? And, what if there is no 
choice at stage 5? What if it turns out in stage 6 that a wrong move has been 
made? 
Hatim and Munday (2004 , p. 52) stress that achieving equivalence involves a com­
plex decision-making process and that translation decisions are not straightforward 
and “sequential.” They are rather hierarchal, highly complex, and motivated by the 
following factors: 
1 
Aesthetics: The nature of decision making is driven by a number of subjective 
factors, such as the translator’s own “aesthetic standards” (Levy, 1967 in  Hatim 
& Munday, 2004 ). 
2 
Cognition and knowledge: The authors assert that the translator’s own  socio­
cognitive system (the translator’s culture and system of values, beliefs, etc.) is 
less subjective than aesthetics. The system plays a signiﬁcant role in informing 
translation decisions. 
3 
Commission: Hatim and Munday point out that the task speciﬁcation agreed 
with clients can signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the decision-making process. This high­
lights translation purpose, loyalty, and conﬂict of interests, among other factors. 
Hatim and Munday maintain that the nature of the commission is a central fac­
tor in deﬁning the purpose of the translation.

those having translation memory as in TRADOS, can be of great use for students 
and translators. However, translations using such software many not be accurate due 
to syntactic structures or lexical ambiguities.

Another “call for signiﬁcant social change” came from Saudi Arabia in 2017 with 
the ascent to power  in 2015 of Prince Salman Bin Abdulaziz (as King) and later 
his young son Prince Mohammed Bin Salman (MBS) as Crown Prince who spear­
headed that call. In a country notorious for corruption and Wasta, MBS unleashed a 
campaign to ﬁght these two problems in Saudi society in a very unprecedented  way. 
He arrested and imprisoned many rich Saudi businessmen and royal family members 
on allegations of corruption. MBS  exacted millions and billions from them for their 
release and vowed to clean Saudi society of this “scourge.” But these  are early days 
to pass judgment. Only time will tell if this campaign has resulted in a signiﬁcant

social change in Saudi Arabia. This is assuming MBS remains in power – and later 
becomes King – to see the outcome of his actions. However, the Saudi political sys­
tem may struggle to overcome problems of insecurity, poverty, and unpredictability. 
As a consequence, in the immediate to midterm, Wasta will continue to remain a

TRANSLATING NEWS 
2.1 Introduction 
Journalists’ main task lies in informing the public about issues or events having 
effects on their lives.  Fabiszak (2007 , p. 73) points out that: 
Journalists, in their drive for a scoop, and in their attempt to sell, frequently use 
inﬂated rhetoric, responsible for the introduction of highly emotional vocabu­
lary into the language of the news. They also construct catch phrases, which 
through constant repetition become the clichés reproduced again and again by 
the media, and by the authorities communicating with the public through the 
media. The value-laden, simpliﬁed picture of the world as represented by the 
media becomes the world for its recipients. 
There is a growing interest in the impact of translation and news making on political 
and economic issues. News making and coverage inﬂuence not only public opinion 
on certain political issues, especially those related to conﬂicts, but also their form 
( Baum, 2006 ). News translation is not simply a matter of rendering STs into TTs 
but rather detailed and purposeful rewriting and reproduction of news reporting “to 
accommodate a completely different set of audience expectations” ( Bassnett & Con­
way, 2006 , p. 6) by way of manipulating the ST news story. News reporters invoke 
and apply some social norms, which they deﬁne, and news therefore does not reﬂect 
a society but “helps to constitute it as a shared social phenomenon, for in the pro­
cess of describing an event, news deﬁnes and shapes that event” ( Tuchman, 1978 , 
pp. 183–184). This reﬂects that news translation is subject to certain constraints of 
time and space that may not impact translators of other text types. Given this, it 
is not easy to assign a deﬁnition for news translation, because translated texts are 
adapted to a new readership under ideological factors that are mediated by editors 

 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
20 Translating news 
( Brook, 2012 ). In addition, news translation is inﬂuenced by the translator’s view of 
the target audience, which certainly shapes the translation process and product ( Hol­
land, 2013 ). Translation of news necessitates familiarity with the factors inﬂuenc­
ing the writing of source text news and those governing the rendering of a text that 
meets the expectations of target readers. Translation strategies are therefore shaped 
by news agencies, be they independent or governmental, translators’ intervention, 
and target readers’ expectations. 
The course of a news text depends on the type of news event and its place, the 
news agencies covering such news, the language involved, as well as the human, 
ﬁnancial, and technological resources available in source and target locations ( Hol­
land, 2013 ). This indicates a multifaceted range of constraints, and possibly, prob­
lems that inﬂuence news translation. Holland identiﬁes time pressure as one of the 
constrains on news making and translation. The author remarks that news agencies 
compete to have the ﬁrst and best coverage of a news story given the market-driven 
nature of modern societies. Analyzing news translation should consider such speed 
of gathering, production, and dissemination. The second constraint  that Holland 
(2013 , p. 337) discusses is  resource constraint. Translating news necessitates using 
any available resources as quickly as possible because the news agency capacity 
determines the volume of the resources. 
Translation as rewriting 
Rendering texts between different languages eventually involves changes attributed 
to linguistic or paralinguistic factors that sometimes compel translators to produce 
texts relatively differing from those of the source language. In this context, the act 
of translation is seen as a reproduction in the target language ( Nida & Taber, 1969 ); 
a replacement of an original text into a target text ( Catford, 1965 ); or, most impor­
tantly, an ideologically motivated rewriting of the original ( Cunico & Munday, 
2016 ;  Lefevere, 1992 ). Lefevere explains that certain rewritings are produced under 
ideological constraints regardless of the rewriters’ agreement on the dominant ide­
ologies. Restricted to subjective texts that include news stories, the level of rewrit­
ing is controlled by the value an ST enjoys in the TL. 
In Translation in Global News, Bassnett and Bielsa describe the translation car­
ried out within news agencies as “rewriting” ( 2009 , p. 57) and, following an exami­
nation of the kinds of modiﬁcations involved in the translation process, conclude that 
the level of intervention required from the translators changes their traditional role. 
Brook (2012 ) argues that the determining forces of “patronage,” which are central in 
media, represent a major component of Lefevere’s theory of rewriting. “Patronage” 
refers to “the powers (persons, institutions) that can further or hinder the reading, 
writing and rewriting of literature” ( Lefevere, 1992 , p. 15). Using “rewriting” to 
replace “translation,” Lefevere classiﬁes three components to patronage: The ideo­
logical component, which acts as a constraint on the choice and development of both 
form and subject matter; the economic component, which concerns the payment of 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
Translating news 21 
writers and rewriters; and the status component, which reﬂects rewriters’ needs to 
be part of a particular group and therefore behave in a way that supports the group. 
Clearly, Lefevere introduces translation as a kind of rewriting produced under the 
ideological and political constraints of the target language culture. This theory basi­
cally means that texts produced on the basis of other texts accommodate those other 
texts to particular ideologies. 
Translation and purpose are closely linked and the interplay between them is 
multifaceted. Writers’ ideologies are manifested in their writings to serve their 
predetermined objectives. Translators, inﬂuenced by their individual ideologies or 
social ideologies, manipulate the original texts through rewriting. Text manipula­
tion in translation can be ideological, as in translating English news on the Israeli-
Palestinian conﬂict into Arabic, or cultural, the examples of which are abundant. 
Regardless of the views on translation, translators are rewriters working to present 
different images of original texts that are sometimes loaded with ideologies conﬂict­
ing with those of the target readers. 
Ideology and media 
Media establishes strong ties between individuals and sovereign powers, which 
often impose their ideological values on media. Functioning to inﬂuence the pub­
lic, media frames the social thought and view of the other according to the politi­
cal ideology of the sovereign powers. People generally have a tendency to be 
persuaded by the media, which shapes a confusing reality ( Luostarinen, 2002 ; 
Mral, 2006 ). Promoting the link between ideology to media,  Brook (2012 ) argues 
that rendering source language texts and maintaining neutrality in addressing 
challenges created by connotation, perspective, and ideology makes the process of 
international newswriting more complex than translating and interpreting. Brook 
(2012 ) further explains that news is a marketable commodity. As thus, the trans­
lation of news is to suit the target readers, just as the original news articles were 
to serve the interests and ideologies of journalists. In the context of international 
news, translation, which involves dealing with ideologies ( Thomson & White, 
2008 ), remains the ideal means of conveying such news to readers of different 
ideological values across the world. In this context, Bazzi (2009 ) maintains that 
media plays a key role in politics and can be manipulated to represent certain 
ideologies. 
In the case of conﬂicts, news reporters cannot adhere to neutrality; they involve 
themselves through narration and reporting ( Nohrstedt, 2009 ). Nohrstedt stresses 
that news articles in certain instances are not written to inform the public, but rather 
to persuade them to support one party to the conﬂict. In the Handbook of Discourse 
Analysis, Van Dijk (2001 ) explains that media agencies adopt the political views 
of the “political actors” and determine the events to be reported and the words to 
be used. Eide (2016 ) uses the expression of “othering” and relates it to the work of 
editorial choices in newsrooms. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
22 Translating news 
An example of an old-current conﬂict in which ideology is heavily utilized in 
media is the Palestinian-Israeli conﬂict. Slater (2007 ) highlights that Israelis and 
Palestinians utilize media to achieve and sustain their interests. Both conﬂicting 
parties are quite familiar with the key role media plays in politics and conﬂicts. 
Seeking to gain international support, Israeli and Palestinian media outlets present 
an image of the other as a victimizer. Whereas Palestinian news agencies use words 
(martyr) to attract international ﺷﻬﯿﺪ
 ect religious ideology, as in  
ﬂ
and images that re 
support from people sharing the same religious ideology, Israeli news agencies 
depict Palestinians as terrorists to convince the world that the Israeli measures 
against the Palestinians are nothing but self-protection. The impact of the conﬂict 
can be seen in the writing of news and the translation of such news to readers siding 
with either party. 
Ideology and translation 
The interplay between ideology and translation, as Karoubi (2005 ) explains, is old. 
Fawcett (1998 ) explains that individuals and institutions apply their speciﬁc beliefs 
to produce a certain effect through translation. The impact of ideology on transla­
tion can be seen in the earliest examples of translation known to readers. Ideology 
encompasses the implicit assumptions, beliefs, and value systems that a social group 
collectively shares ( Hatim & Mason, 1997 ) and “the set of beliefs and values which 
inform an individual’s or institution’s view of the world and assist their interpreta­
tions of events, facts, etc.” ( Mason, 1994 , p. 25). 
In this context, Schäffner (1997 ) stresses that translations are ideological because 
choosing a source text and determining the use in the target text are determined by 
the interests, aims, and objectives of social agents. The close link between transla­
tion and politics (and certainly ideologies) is evident in the selection of words that 
reﬂect the author’s and translator’s ideologies ( D’Amico, 2015 ). To reﬂect their ide­
ology in the source text, authors add, remove, or attenuate the connotations present 
in the source text, and such measures are attained through the addition or removal 
of words in the translation in order to meet the ideological expectation of the target 
readership. Loupaki (2010 , pp. 56–57) highlights that translators tend to “reproduce 
[. . . the] norms shared by their community.” On the relation between translation, 
texts, and “the other,” Koster (2002, p. 26 as quoted in  Hewson, 2011 , p. 16) says 
that translation is “a representation of another text and at the same time a text in its 
own right.” Ali (2007 ) maintains that translators take into account the “ideologi­
cal implication” when translating. In addition, they “negotiate” the thoughts of the 
source author. 
Reﬂecting the strong link between ideology and translation, the representation of 
the “other” is clearly marked by translators’ ideological values, which can present 
a different image from that of the “other.” Venuti’s (2008 ) approach to the invis­
ibility of translators does not ﬁt in the context of news translation due to the ideo­
logical systems and values that are visible in the target text. Translation therefore 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
Translating news 23 
goes beyond the limits of replacing source language words and expressions by their 
equivalents in the target language ( Bassnett & Schäffner, 2010 ). 
Transediting 
Translating sensitive news stories to an audience that normally holds a different 
account of events involves deliberate rewriting and editing of ST news stories. 
Transediting, though criticized, plays a signiﬁcant role in the translation of news, 
especially when source text news and target text news represent conﬂicting accounts 
of the same events. A current example of such events is the Great March of Return 
on the eastern borders of Gaza Strip beginning on March 30, 2018. Stetting intro­
duced the term transediting in 1989 by blending translating and editing. The use 
of the term reﬂects the extent of editing that is vital to the translation process when 
the ST and TT are loaded with cultural and ideological values. The signiﬁcance of 
transediting in news translation appears clearly when considering the translators’ 
editing decisions to produce translations suited to meet the expectations and needs 
of a new readership. In this context, Stetting explains that a “certain amount of edit­
ing has always been included in the translation task” ( 1989 , p. 371). An example of 
transediting is the omission of “passages which might be irrelevant in the foreign 
context” (p. 371). Her examples included changing  miles in source text into kilome­
ters in the target texts, addition of explanations to source text cultural referents, and 
omission of information irrelevant to the target culture readership. 
Stetting adds that “cultural and situational adaptations” are necessary to satisfy 
the expectations of the target readership. She further maintains that editors change, 
add, or remove information from texts in the target language. Adding to the afore­
mentioned, Stetting highlights that translators’ acts include correcting source text 
errors and improving textual cohesion, grammar, and style. She says that the task of 
an editor lies in “improve[ing] clarity, relevance, and adherence to the conventions 
of the textual type in question – without “killing” the personality and the interesting 
features of the actual piece of writing” ( 1989 , p. 372). 
The primary focus of Stetting’s transediting is “on the needs of the translation 
receivers,” which “will depend on the function the translated text serves, seen from 
their point of view, and not just from that of the sender” ( 1989 , p. 373). Stetting 
(pp. 373–374) lists the following practices of transediting: 
• 
Shortening texts for subtitling 
• 
Making texts idiomatic and well-structured 
• 
Omitting inadequate texts 
• 
Using material written in other languages for writing news texts 
Stetting (1989 , p. 374) notes that transediting can be practiced in translating liter­
ary, religious, and historical texts “although in a minor way.” She (p. 376) believes 
that translators need “to see to it that the original intentions are reborn in a new and 

 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
24 Translating news 
better shape in the target language [ . . .] turns into a ‘transeditor.’” She (p. 377) lists 
three different areas of transediting as follows: 
a) “Cleaning-up transediting,” changes made to adapt a standard of efﬁciency in 
expression; 
b) “Situational transediting,” adapting the intended function of the translated text 
in its new social context; and 
c) “Cultural transediting,” adapting the text to the needs and norms of the target 
culture. 
Stetting aims to prove to her readers that changes made to a translation are nec­
essary. However, her transediting is not merely a new concept but rather a label­
ing of translation techniques existing before. Some scholars argued for and against 
her concept of transediting, including Hursti (2001 ) who adopted the concept and 
encouraged other scholars to use the same. On the contrary,  Bassnett and Bielsa 
(2009 , pp. 63–64) disregard the “somewhat artiﬁcial concept of transediting – the 
use of which would seem to imply the existence of another form of translating 
news.” They prefer using “news translation” to indicate the combination between 
editing and translation. Schäffner (2012 ) explains that “transediting” can improve 
the understanding of news translation as a distinct genre, but the term can nega­
tively impact the understanding of translation practice. Regardless of the debate on 
the practicality of transediting, news stories loaded with political ideologies cannot 
be translated to target readership of different ideologies without text manipulation, 
which includes addition, deletion, and lexical and structural changes (substitution 
and reorganization). 
Examples of transediting 
1. Addition 
Stetting (1989 ) believes that addition is necessary when translating to a target 
readership. Hursti (2001 ) explains that journalists add information to the TT 
that is not present in the ST when the agency story takes the understanding of 
a certain detail or background information for granted. Examples of Palestinian 
translators’ rendering of the Israeli English news into Arabic reﬂect that certain 
additions are ideologically motivated to serve the ideological expectations of the 
Arab readers. Consider the following example from Daraghmeh, Herzallah, and 
Karim (2010 ): 
The IDF and the government ofﬁcials cried foul at what they called the 
shameless use of civilians as human shields, but the Hamas government 
praised the women as heroes and encouraged further female contributions 
to the resistance.

ت The introductory phrase 
despite the killing and house demolition carried out by the occupation army, clearly 
reﬂects that such an addition fulﬁlls ideological purposes aiming to disregard the Israeli 
account of the news story and alternatively stress the Palestinian stand on the same. 
2. Deletion 
Stetting (1989 ) explains that deletion can occur at different lexical units ranging 
from words to sentences. An example of deleting ST information is the deletion of 
terrorist in the following example from the Jerusalem Post: 
. In this example, the word terrorist ﻓﺘﺎة
ﻓﻠﺴﻄﯿﻨﯿﺔ
.
. . .A teenage female terrorist 
 in Arabic) was deleted from the target text. إرﻫﺎﺑﻲ
 (
3. Substitution 
Substitution refers to replacing ST lexical units by different TT units. Examples 
include: 
• 
Over the past week, there has been an increase in the number of rockets ﬁred 
at Sderot and other Negev towns, and Defense Minister Amir Peretz yesterday 
ordered the IDF to step-up its anti-rocket activity.

4. Reorganization 
This transediting technique involves foregrounding or backgrounding of ST lexical 
materials into the TT. Such reorganization can serve linguistic or ideological pur­
poses. Consider the following examples:

Translators in conﬂict zones 
 The signiﬁcance of this section lies in that there is little literature on translators’ 
roles in conﬂict and war zones, which Baker (2010 ) conﬁrms. Inghilleri (2010 ) 
maintains that translators working in violent conﬂict zones play complex and mul­
tifaceted roles. She explains that when in conﬂict, translators are required to make 
ethical decisions that go beyond spoken or written texts. Inghilleri adds that histori­
cal, cultural, personal, and political realities contribute to determining the scope of 
translators’ participation. Translators can create a violent conﬂict even if the narra­
tives in question do not depict conﬂict or war.  Baker (2006 , p. 2) says “translation 
and interpreting are essential for circulating and resisting the narratives that create 
the intellectual and moral environment for violent conﬂict in the ﬁrst place, even 
though the narratives in question may not directly depict conﬂict or war.” 
Translators can play an impartial role when source texts are free from political or 
religious ideologies that can give rise to conﬂict. However, given the intensity of the 
conﬂict between the Israelis and Palestinians, the visibility of translators working 
on political texts or news articles is on the rise. Translators working on texts relating 
to this conﬂict work against speciﬁc grounds that shape their roles and experiences. 
They are under the inﬂuence of the explicitly dominating political ideology and the 
implicit religious ideology. These can be seen in various texts where certain lexical 
units provide a clear reference to such political and religious ideologies. 
Utilizing media as an optimal tool for self-representation and denial of the other, 
journalists circulate narratives that promote their cause. Media aims to shape the attitude 
of the outsiders to the conﬂict to gain sympathy and support. An example of the role 
of journalists and translators in conﬂict zone lies in the work of Palestinian and Israeli 
journalists and translators. There is a striking contrast between the Palestinian and Israeli 
narratives of the conﬂict. Such contrast is clearly reﬂected in media coverage by Pales­
tinian journalists and news agencies on the one hand and Israeli media on the other. 
Palestinians, Israelis, and independent observers believe that international media 
news coverage of the Palestinian-Israeli conﬂict is biased. Journalists on both sides use 
diction to inﬂuence outsiders’ interpretation of events taking place in the conﬂict zone. 
Consider the following terminological differences and notice their impact on outsiders:
 1 
Security fence as opposed to apartheid wall reﬂects that the Israeli media con­
siders such a wall as protection. On the other hand, Palestinian journalists view 
it as separation based on racial considerations. 
2 
Terrorist as opposed to freedom ﬁghter highlights that the Israeli media labels 
Palestinians resisting Israel as terrorists. However, the Palestinian media

2.2 The newspaper 
A newspaper, printed or online, is a type of publication issued at regular time peri­
ods, that contains news, advertisements, articles, or other information. It can target

or

the general public, for example,

اﻟﻤﺎل
 or
The Wall Street Journal
or specialized readers, for example, 
newspapers mainly focus on online content but have a print form. There are also 
online news websites such as Yahoo, India News, NBC News, among others. 
Warner (2011 ) explains that each daily newspaper has unique content because the 
markets, readers, and advertisers of such newspapers are different. News agencies 
write, edit, and produce newspapers the uniqueness of which lies in recreating their 
products daily. In addition, newspaper content depends on the markets and the size 
of the newspaper. For example,  USA Today and the Wall Street Journal focus their 
news coverage on major national and international news. Metropolitan newspapers 
like the Los Angeles Times emphasize state and national news, politics, and sports and 
de-emphasize local and community news. Community newspapers present a highly 
localized content covering news about local city and county governments, high school 
sports, group activities, and other information not normally covered by the larger 
newspapers. Newspapers offer different versions of business and entertainment news. 
In order to appeal to all family members, editors produce different materials beyond 
covering the news only. For example, pages covering sports and ﬁnancial news appeal 
mostly to male readers, whereas lifestyle and social news appeal mostly to females. 
Newspapers are normally designed to include different sections and perform various 
functions, some of which relate to readers’ daily lives. In addition, a newspaper can 
serve one or more functions for different categories of readers. 
Functions of news media 
McQuail (1994, quoted in Rausch, 2012 , p. 49) suggests ﬁve newspaper functions 
as follows: 
• 
Being informative – providing information about current events 
• 
Being correlative – explaining, interpreting and commenting on the meaning of 
these events; 

 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
28 Translating news 
• 
Ensuring continuity – representing the dominant culture while simultaneously 
recognizing subcultures and legitimizing new cultural developments; 
• 
Providing entertainment – providing amusement, diversion, relaxation and 
release of social tension, and 
• 
Acting to mobilize – campaigning for societal objectives in the areas of politics, 
war, economic development, work, and sometimes religion. 
2.3 Features of English news headlines 
NEWSPAPER HEADLINES 
Swan (2005 , p. 211) explains that “headlines are short titles above news reports” 
and further points out that readers can ﬁnd English news headlines difﬁcult to under­
stand because they are often written in a “special style” that differs from the style of 
ordinary English. News headlines feature the use of special grammatical rules and 
unusual usage of words. Fortanet, Palmer, and Posteguillo (2001 , p. 154) say that 
“Newspapers headlines are rather more complex, as they have developed a special 
syntax and vocabulary and normally display certain distinctive stylistic features all 
of which is usually referred to as headlinese.” They add that the syntax used in head­
lines is elliptical with the deletion of some words and the verb be. Simpliﬁed tenses, 
heavy premodiﬁcation, special punctuation, and abbreviation are key features of 
news headlines. Verdonk (2002 , p. 4) maintains that ellipsis is a main feature of 
newspaper headlines. Shams (2013 , p. 23) remarks that “English newspapers head­
lines are written in telegraphic style and this elliptical and compressed style together 
with the headlines’ special vocabulary make them difﬁcult to understand.” 
Headlines style 
A news headline should brieﬂy present the key points of the news story to which it 
relates and simultaneously attracts readers’ attention. Verdonk (2002 , p. 4) explains 
that “an essential feature of headlines is their typographical make-up.” The font 
of news headlines is usually larger and bolder than that of the stories they present. 
Due to the restricted space in page layout available for print, ellipsis is a dominant 
feature of headlines language. Such ellipsis results in a brief and powerful style. The 
lexical items deleted can usually be guessed from the context. The author provided 
Life on Mars – War of Words as an example of a news headline. The ordinary 
English version of the this headline reads “The Life on Mars Debate Remains a War 
of Words.” The headline does not contain a verb, which is replaced by the dash (–). 
This helps to focus on “Life on Mars” and “War of Words.” The previous headline 
presented new information and at the same time attracted readers’ attention. 
Saxena (2006 , p. 47) points out that the point size and style of a news headline 
depend on three main factors as follows: 
a 
Column width 
b 
Design needs 
c 
Nature of the story

Whereas a small point size is used to write a headline for a single column, a large 
point size is used for headlines that run across more than a column. The largest point 
size is normally reserved for the lead story of the news headline. The size and font 
style of a news headline are governed by the nature of the story. Hard news head­
lines feature bold typeface, whereas a light or italicized typeface is normally used 
for offbeat stories. News headlines also feature grammatical and lexical features that 
set them apart from other text types. Swan (2005 , pp. 211–220) lists the following 
syntactic and vocabulary features:1

News impact factors 
Scharbach (1965 , p. 80) explains that “Good journalism features reporting that is 
accurate, balanced, fair and objective, clear, concise, and current.” Accuracy and 
objectivity are two main features of news media. 
Accuracy 
Allan and Zelizer (2010 ) say that accuracy in news media refers to the state 
of being exact and precise. Journalists provide factual accounts of the events 
on which they report. Accuracy refers to verifying facts, contextualizing and 
evaluating details, eliminating mistakes, and ensuring the presentation of the 
most widely supported perspective. This news feature is crucial for any good 
and reliable news report. A reporter must obtain the right facts, which include 
names, designations, incident details, and attribution (source of news). In this 
context, Smith (2003 , p. 129) stresses that “Accuracy is crucial. Check and 
double-check all facts. Check spelling, punctuation and correct use of the style-
book.” A news story can be attributed to anonymous sources if such sources do 
not want their names to be revealed. When translating a news report, translators 
need to accurately account for and render all the information in the ST. Failure 
to verify facts and misunderstanding the news story context can lead to serious 
consequences.

Utah mother of two killed in collision with 15-year-old (The Daily Mail) 
A mother of two has been killed in a head-on collision after a 15-year-old boy 
swerved into her lane while driving unsupervised on a learner’s permit. 
Samantha Perkes, 28, died instantly in the crash around 3:40 pm on Saturday in 
Smithﬁeld, Utah, after a Ford Fusion driven by the boy struck her Pontiac Grand Am 
from the opposing lane.

China: We do not aim to let Islam spread locally 
China partially conﬁrmed UN reports that about a million from the Rohingya 
Muslims are detained in the capital city. 
Objectivity 
Objectivity in news reporting means that when reporters cover news, they should 
refrain from conveying their own feelings and biases in the news stories. The lan­
guage used must be neutral without describing people or institutions. Smith (2003 , 
p. 127) says “In news writing, readers should know they are obtaining facts, not the 
opinion, speculation or editorial comments of the writer.” 
Consider the following example from Almanna (2016 , p. 179) where the transla­
tor did not render the text objectively. The text in bold in the ST and TT refers to the 
ST items and their un-objectively rendered TT lexical equivalents. 
In an interview with Newsweek yesterday,  the Israeli Defense Minister said 
that the Palestinian suicide operations constitute the main cause for the Israeli 
troops’ entering cities in the West Bank.

English news lacks objectivity? 
A Palestinian Arab terrorist on Sunday went on a stabbing and shooting spree that 
left one Israeli dead and two more in critical condition. 
The terrorist assaulted an Israeli soldier near a bus stop. After stabbing the soldier, 
the terrorist managed to seize his riﬂe and immediately opened ﬁre on passing vehicles.

2.4 Features of Arabic news headlines 
Younis (2012 , p. 79) explains that Arabic news headlines summarize the key infor­
mation in the news article in a few words to attract readers’ attention. An Arabic 
news headline normally answers two questions: Who? What? Sometimes a news 
headline can answer why. Consider the following:

Lexical features 
Younis (2012 , p. 74) says that politicians consider politics as a play of words. Some 
occupy certain positions as a result of their ability to speak effectively and persuade 
people through media. The language of media is signiﬁcantly developing because 
new words and phrases are introduced as a reﬂection of political events. Examples 
(moderate), ﻣﻌﺘﺪل
( Islamist), إﺳﻼﻣﻲ
 of such words include, but are not limited to,

(suicide bomber), اﻧﺘﺤﺎري
( settler), ﻣﺴﺘﻮﻃﻦ

( terrorist), etc. إرﻫﺎﺑﻲ
 
The author points out that the vocabulary used in news media is simple, common, 
and clear. In addition, the language used in media texts is a mix of standard lan­
guage and everyday language. Journalists, therefore, should carefully select words 
that attract audience attention. Equally important, translators need to account for such 
words in their translation to achieve the same effect on TT readers as that of the ST. 
News impact factors 
Ismail (1998 ) lists the factors that make a news story worth publishing and reading. 
Some of these key factors are as follows: 
Newness: The newness of a news article plays a signiﬁcant role in attracting readers 
interested in information about current events. Newness does not conﬁne itself to 
recent events, because old news can be published when containing new informa­
tion about an old topic. News stories about the 1967 Egyptian prisoners are consid­
ered old news stories. However, new updates on such stories signiﬁcantly attract 
Arab readers who generally consider such stories important to the Arab nation. 
Newsworthiness: Newsworthiness refers to a news story that is particularly 
relevant to individual readers or the public. The value of a news story deter­
mines the level of attention given to it by media outlets, audiences, or readers. 
Given the difﬁcult economic conditions in Gaza, a news story on vacancies in 
Qatar for Gazans is of a particular interest. 
Timeliness: When the news story relates to the general conditions of the audi­
ence that the story targets, the chances of publishing such a story are greater. 
News must be directly related to the time of the event. A news story on sup­
plying schoolbooks in the summer holiday is neither attractive nor effective. 
Hugeness: A news story about a train crash leaving 50 people dead is important 
because it relates to a large audience. 
Suspense: A news story covering an incident that is not common in a certain 
society attracts readers’ attention. An example of this was the news story 
about the suicide of a hajj in Mecca in August 2018. 
Prominence: News stories about well-known people, places, or events have a 
greater impact on the audience than news about people or places that are not 
familiar to the audience. A news story about a professor visiting your univer­
sity is not as important as the prime minister’s visit. 
Oddity: Readers are interested is something that is unusual or shocking. A story 
about a police ofﬁcer leading a gang is an interesting story to many. 
Human interest: A news story drawing an emotional reaction is a story of

may be more important to some Arab readers than a news story about people 
killed in a car accident.

2.5 Newspapers sections 
Lead stories/leads 
The lead section usually comes ﬁrst in a newspaper because it is the foundation 
stone of any newspaper. The front page is designed to present important stories on 
local, regional, or international news events. 
A news story must include a lead paragraph, the opening sentence(s)/paragraph 
of a news article, containing the key details of the story to follow. The lead para­
graph primarily “entertains and hooks the readers” ( Guth, Marsh, & Short, 2016 , 
p. 90). If the lead paragraph is not accurate and sharp, readers may skip the news 
story. The following are the major elements of a good lead. 
5 Ws and 1 H 
Hall and Manfull (2016 , p. 21) say that news leads must have an impact and begin 
with what element because readers are primarily more interested in what happened 
than in the where and when of the story. The second most important element in the 
lead is the who, because readers ﬁnd prominent people interesting. The authors 
warn against the overuse of who in the lead stories. The  when and where elements 
of the lead are usually included toward the end of the lead but can be used at the 
beginning in case of a change in time and place. The lead is usually one paragraph 
but can be longer if necessary. The why element tells the readers about the reason 
for something said or done. The  H element answers the question on how something 
happened. Consider the following example from Irani and Telg (2011 , p. 77): 
Five Anyville High School students (who) and one teacher were injured (what) 
Sunday night (when) when their van slid out of control on icy roads (how) in eastern 
Kentucky (where).

Editorial and opinion 
Thomas (2018 , p. 397) says that “The newspaper editorial column is a space where 
the newspaper as an organization communicates its views to its readership.” The 
editorial column, possibly written by any of the newspaper’s editorial staff, functions 
as “close as is possible to being an institutional voice of [the] newspaper” ( Hindman, 
2003, p. 671). Editorials primarily indicate newspapers’ positions on political and 
social matters. Covering local, regional, or international topics, the editorial column 
aims to form readers’ opinions on certain issues presented in the newspaper. 
Opin ion columns, referred to as the op-ed (opposite editorial), represent the 
voices of individual authors and journalists who may not be afﬁliated to a certain 
publication editorial board. These columns aim to broaden issues and viewpoints in 
newspapers. The following section provides examples of English and Arabic edito­
rials and opinions followed by translation exercises.

The most accurate description of Zimbabwe in the era of Robert Mugabe came from 
a fellow leader of the struggle against white rule. It was Samora Machel, then presi­
dent of Mozambique and a fervent enemy of colonialism, who told Mugabe in 1980 
that Zimbabwe was the “jewel of Africa,” adding: “Don’t tarnish it!”

ita ry occupation and direct hegemony on all aspects of the daily life of the 
Palestinians.

1. Rescuing the lost children of IS (BBC) 
Tens of thousands of foreign ﬁghters joined so-called Islamic State in Iraq and 
Syria – many of them from Russia. 
I n the breakfast room of Baghdad’s grandest hotel, among the businessmen 
and ofﬁcial delegations, they look so out of place – four pale-faced children, aged 
between about three and six. 
 They’re wolﬁng down their bowls of cereal with determination, but in silence. 
You can tell they’re not on a family holiday. There are two women sitting with them, 
one nursing a small baby. But unlike the children, the women look Iraqi – and the 
body language is strangely distant. The children seem lost, mistrustful.

2. Trump doesn’t want peace. He wants Palestinian surrender. 
(Opinion from the New York Times) 
The Trump administration says it has a peace plan for the Middle East. Those behind 
it claim that they are offering a new approach to end the Israeli-Palestinian conﬂict, 
one focused on an “economic vision,” and that it deserves a chance. Yet none of 
what has been revealed so far has addressed the real issues: the end of the Israeli 
occupation that began in 1967 and the preservation of the internationally recognized 
inalienable rights of the people of Palestine. 
Unless the Trump administration’s plan addresses these issues head-on, it is a 
non-starter for the Palestinians. It should be for the rest of the world, as well. Judg­
ing from the statements and actions that have emerged from the administration so 
far, there is no reason to believe that President Trump’s supposed peace plan will 
present a departure point for peace.

3. We need a long-term solution for captured ISIS members 
(opinion from CNN) 
The crumbled ISIS caliphate has bequeathed the world a terrible inheritance: Thousands 
of captured ISIS ﬁghters and their families, many of whom remain dedicated to ISIS. 
A nd with the apparent re-emergence, via video, of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al- 
Baghdadi on Monday encouraging what remains of ISIS to continue, radical detain­
ees represent an even greater risk. (The United States is working to conﬁrm the 
authenticity of the video.) 
The parched, forbidding sands of northeast Syria are home to detention camps, with 
one, al-Hol, holding more than 73,000 people, according to the Washington Post. 
The atmosphere inside the detention centers is toxic, with overcrowding, ﬁghts 
over food, threats of harassment by followers of the Islamic State, and guards being 
attacked, according to news reports and the Middle East Institute.

4. If you want peace, prepare for war (by George F. Will) 
Scholars have already debated for decades, and will debate for centuries, the role 
U.S. policies – military, diplomatic, economic – played in bringing the Cold War to 
endgame and the Soviet Union to extinction. One milestone was Ronald Reagan’s 
1983 Strategic Defense Initiative proposal, a technological challenge that could not 
be met by a Soviet economy already buckling under the combined weight of mili­
tary spending and socialism’s ignorance. But before SDI, there was Ocean Venture 
’81, approved by Reagan as president-elect. 
The protracted strategy, of which this enormous operation – 15 nations’ navies, 
250 ships, more than 1,000 aircraft – was a harbinger, came to be referred to by 
some Soviets as the “Lehman strategy.” In “Oceans Ventured: Winning the Cold 
War at Sea,” John Lehman, a Navy aviator who was secretary of the Navy dur­
ing Reagan’s ﬁrst six years, explains the Navy’s role in the “forward strategy” that 
implemented Reagan’s Cold War policy. Reagan explained the policy when asked 
about it in 1977: “We win and they lose, what do you think of that?”

5. Bahrain summit: there is no economic path to Middle East peace 
(Middle East Eye) 
In launching the “deal of the century” for Palestinian-Israeli peace along the eco­
nomic path, Trump adviser Jared Kushner is following a well-worn track that leads 
to a dead end. 
 As the ﬁrst step towards peace efforts, Kushner and US envoy Jason Greenblatt 
will hold the “Peace to Prosperity” workshop in Bahrain this week. Attendees will be 
invited to make pledges to support investment in the Palestinian economy – despite 
the fact that “economic peace” has been tried and failed before, as vital business 
elements are lacking in the absence of a comprehensive peace process. 
Barriers to investment 
In 2011, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Middle East 
Q uartet envoy Tony Blair announced a package of “economic peace” measures 
to kickstart the peace process. Development of one of the Palestinian economy’s 
potentially largest projects, the “Gaza Marine” natural gas ﬁeld, was at the center 
of that package.

Wanta (2006 , p. 117) explains that “the sports section is one of the most popular 
sections in the newspaper.” The sports news section, essential in almost every news­
paper, covers news or sports events organized locally, regionally, or internationally. 
Lewis (1999 , p. 100) says “The sports section of the daily newspaper, much like the 
entertainment or society pages – exists apart from ‘real’ or ‘hard’ news as a source 
of escape and pleasure.” Following are a number of translation exercises between 
English and Arabic that aim to provide translation students with some basic vocabu­
lary used in sports news. 
Exercise 12: translate the following extracts of sports news into Arabic 
1. Ramtha take on Faisali in Jordan Cup ﬁnal (source: The Jordan Times) 
AMMAN – The Jordan Cup ﬁnal is set to be played on Saturday evening, with 
Faisali and Ramtha aiming to win the title of the third competition of the season. 
Faisali eliminated Karmel in the semis beating them 1-0 in both legs while 
Ramtha upset Wihdat beating them 3-1. 
After Faisali won the Jordan Professional Football League title earlier this month, 
Wihdat were looking to win the Jordan Cup. 
However, Ramtha ended that aim and they now have a chance to win the Cup 
for a third time after they last won 28 years ago in the back to back season of 
1990–1991. 
2. Cricket World Cup: will anyone stop England? World Cup predictions (BBC) 
The World Cup gets under way on Thursday, when hosts England take on South 
Africa at The Oval. 
After a dismal showing four years ago, England enter this tournament as favou­
rites and the number one side in the world.

But will they lift the World Cup for the ﬁrst time? Test Match Special pundits 
and commentators, former players and journalists give their predictions on who will 
make the semi-ﬁnals and who will get their hands on the trophy on 14 July. 
Does anyone think England won’t do it? 
Former England captain Michael Vaughan 
England are the number one team in the world and formidable at home. I can’t see 
how they won’t make the semis. 
Australia have just got something going, Steve Smith and David Warner are back 
and you can argue that they have the best bowling attack. 
3. Formula 1: Max Verstappen’s maturity is earning him millions 
Max Verstappen’s new Red Bull contract is said by those in the know to make him 
the third best paid driver in Formula 1 behind Lewis Hamilton and Sebastian Vettel 
from next year. 
The team will not reveal the exact amount but, by process of elimination, the 
Dutchman’s salary for the next three years will be between £18-26m. Not bad for a 
20-year-old who will be starting only his fourth full season in F1. (BBC) 
4. FIFA announces tougher sanctions on racism, homophobia (Aljazeera) 
players to be suspended for at least 10 games for discriminatory 
behavior under FIFA’s new disciplinary code 
FIFA, world football’s governing body, is doubling its minimum ban for racist inci­
dents to 10 games, and will start inviting players to make victim statements at disci­
plinary hearings, according to its new disciplinary code. 
Stricter handling of discrimination allegations is a key theme of the redrafted 
FIFA disciplinary code which comes into effect next week. 
“Topics like racism and discrimination have been updated, putting FIFA at the 
forefront of the ﬁght against this appalling attack on the fundamental human rights 
of individuals,” the organization said in a statement on Thursday. 
According to FIFA’s diversity and anti-discriminatory policy, “discrimination 
of any kind on account of race, skin color, ethnic, national or social origin . . . 
religion, sexual orientation is strictly prohibited and punishable by suspension or 
expulsion.” 
Yet racism and homophobia remain rife in international football, with fans often 
taking aim at opposing team’s players. 
FIFA’s move towards more transparency will see judicial panel leaders make the 
ﬁnal decision – to approve a request in a doping case or require it in a match-ﬁxing 
prosecution – on allowing the media in and live-streaming proceedings. 
This follows a European Court of Human Rights ruling last year which required 
the Court of Arbitration for Sport to relax secrecy around its traditional closed-door 
hearings. However, lawyers are rarely expected to recommend openness for their 
clients.

5. Egypt sacks Mexican coach after exit from Cup 
of Nations (Alarabiya) 
Egypt coach Javier Aguirre became the ﬁrst casualty of the Africa Cup of Nations as 
he was sacked just hours after the host was bundled out of the tournament by South 
Africa in the round of 16. 
Host Egypt lost 1-0 to an 85th minute goal from Thembinkosi Lorch on Saturday 
at the end of a lacklustre display in which their talisman Mohamed Salah looked out 
of sorts and they produced few goal scoring chances. 
Egypt Football Association president Hany Abo Rida announced the ﬁring of the 
Mexican coach, and his own resignation, less than three hours after the game as a 
stunned host nation digested the defeat. 
Abo Rida also called on his board members to step down, calling his resignation 
a “moral obligation, although the football association had given the national team 
full material and moral support.” 
Aguirre told reporters after Saturday’s defeat that he took sole responsibility but 
was proud of all of his players. 
“The game was open and saw many chances. The only difference was that South 
Africa managed to score,” he said. 
Aguirre, 60, departs after less than a year in the job but not before setting a unique 
record by coaching at four different continental championships.

Economy and business 
Ernsthausen and Moss (2012 , p. 37) say that modest daily newspapers include a 
page or two on business information. The business section in newspapers usually 
consists of “news and feature articles about local businesses and tables of trading 
and price statistics for selected stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and commodities.” The 
authors maintain that “most libraries subscribe to papers that specialize in providing 
in-depth coverage of current business, economic, and ﬁnancial conditions.” The Wall 
Street Journal can be the most important business and ﬁnancial newspaper. Other 
examples of business and ﬁnancial newspapers include Financial Times, Interna­
tional Business Times, Business Standard, The Australian Financial Review, and

Amazon targets Middle East with Arabic website (The Wall Street Journal) 
DUBAI – Amazon.com Inc. said Wednesday it is diving deeper into the Middle 
East’s burgeoning market for online sales, launching the ﬁrst Arabic-language 
site under its own brand in a country better known for over-the-top malls, the 
United Arab Emirates. 
The e-commerce giant’s move comes amid heightened competition for online 
retailers in the Persian Gulf with the rise of Noon.com, a startup formed in 2017 
with backing from Saudi Arabia’s oil-rich sovereign-wealth fund. Amazon also 
has struggled to beat out local online retailers in Europe, India and China and 
faces slowing overseas sales growth despite dominance at home. 
Amazon.com on Wednesday replaced the website of its local subsidiary in the 
U.A.E, Souq.com, with Amazon.ae, and said it would now offer Arabic on the 
Amazon app and website. The new website includes the 30 million products 
from the Souq platform and ﬁve million new items from Amazon in the U.S., 
the company said. 
For now, Amazon will continue to operate the Souq.com brand in other Middle 
East countries, including the more populous markets of Egypt and Saudi Ara­
bia. An Amazon spokeswoman said the company would consider launching the 
Amazon.com brand in other markets in the Middle East once the company was 
ready.

Siemens plans to axe 7,800 jobs to halt revenue stagnation (Financial Times) 
Siemens plans to cut 7,800 jobs worldwide in an attempt to make the sprawling 
engineering conglomerate more efﬁcient and help end a prolonged period of 
revenue stagnation. 
The job cuts represent about 2 per cent of its global workforce and largely affect 
administrative roles. 
Siemens is struggling to close a proﬁtability gap with rival General Electric as 
customers in Europe delay investment decisions and demand for its once highly 
proﬁtable large gas turbines wanes. 
In the absence of growth Joe Kaeser, chief executive, is using other levers – 
including portfolio measures, cost-cutting and share buybacks – to close a mar­
gin shortfall. 
Mr. Kaeser unveiled the cuts on Friday following talks with labor representa­
tives. More than 3,000 of the jobs will be cut in high-cost Germany where Sie­
mens has an agreement with unions to avoid compulsory redundancies.

Abu Dhabi “smartest city” in Middle East: study (business standard) 
Abu Dhabi, capital of the United Arab Emirates (UAE), has topped the list of 
“smart cities” in the Middle East and Africa, the city’s Department of Culture 
and Tourism said on Friday. 
Covering 50 international cities, a report by McKinsey Global Institute titled 
“Smart Cities: Digital Solutions for a More Livable Future” views how cities all 
over the world use technology to improve the quality of life, reports Xinhua. 
With a rating of 18.4, Abu Dhabi ranked the ﬁrst in the region ahead of Dubai, 
which was placed the second with a rating of 17.3. 
Saif Saeed Ghobash, under-secretary of the department, said that in the digital 
age, metropolitan cities are delivering creative ways in which data is used to

Passage one 
Trump Administration Says It Will Negotiate with Iran with “No Precondi­
tions” (The New York Times) 
BELLINZONA, Switzerland – In a second major softening of American policy 
toward Iran in recent days, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Sunday that the 
Trump administration was ready to negotiate with the country’s clerical leaders with 
“no preconditions.” 
The statement followed President Trump’s comment last week that he was ready 
to talk to Iranian leaders and was not seeking regime change, overruling a longtime 
goal of his national security adviser. Mr. Pompeo’s statement also recalibrated his 
earlier position that the United States would not lift sanctions on Iran unless it com­
plied with a dozen sweeping demands, suggesting that those demands could be part 
of negotiations instead of preconditions. 
Iran’s leaders consider the demands unacceptable Tensions between the United 
States and Iran have escalated sharply in recent weeks, raising fears that the two 
countries were edging toward war. The less combative language does not change 
the fact that the Trump administration has tightened economic sanctions on Iran, 
ordered 1,500 additional troops to the Persian Gulf and revised military plans 
against Iran.

The Saudi invitation to Qatar does not indicate improvement of relation. Why? 
Saudi Arabia made a rare invitation to Qatar for its emergency Iran summit. Here’s 
what to expect (CNBC) DUBAI – Arab leaders have convened in Saudi Arabia’s 
holy city of Mecca for a two-day emergency meeting aimed at addressing increasing 
tensions with Iran. 
The Gulf states have even reached out to Qatar, the estranged neighbor that Saudi 
Arabia, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Egypt cut off via a land and 
sea blockade two years ago. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman extended 
his invitation to Qatar and Doha accepted, marking the ﬁrst landing of a Qatari jet in 
Saudi Arabia since June of 2017. 
“The fact that the Saudis contacted the Emir of Qatar directly suggests that the 
tension with Iran is taken very seriously in Riyadh,” Andreas Krieg, a lecturer at the 
King’s College London School of Security Studies, told CNBC. 
“So the kingdom is ready to build a broader than usual consensus on how to deal 
with Iran.” 
But does this signal a breakthrough in Qatar-GCC relations and a possible end to 
the blockade? Don’t hold your breath, regional experts warn.

War 
Passage one 
Ten years after the ﬁrst war on Gaza, Israel still plans endless brute force (The Guard­
ian) This month marks the 10th anniversary of the ﬁrst major military assault on 
the 2 million Palestinians of the Gaza Strip. After its unilateral withdrawal from 
Gaza in 2005, Israel turned the area into the biggest open-door prison on Earth. 
The two hallmarks of Israel’s treatment of Gaza since then have been mendacity 
and the utmost brutality towards civilians. 
On 27 December 2008, Israel launched Operation Cast Lead, pounding the 
densely populated strip from the air, sea and land for 22 days. It was not a war 
or even “asymmetric warfare” but a one-sided massacre. Israel had 13 dead; the 
Gazans had 1,417 dead, including 313 children, and more than 5,500 wounded. 
According to one estimate 83% of the casualties were civilians. Israel claimed to 
be acting in self-defence, protecting its civilians against Hamas rocket attacks. 
The evidence, however, points to a deliberate and punitive war of aggression. 
Israel had a diplomatic alternative, but it chose to ignore it and to resort to brute 
military force. 
In June 2008 Egypt had brokered a ceaseﬁre between Israel and Hamas, the 
Islamic resistance movement that rules Gaza. The agreement called on both sides 
to cease hostilities and required Israel to gradually ease the illegal blockade it had 
imposed on the Gaza Strip in June 2007.

Yemen: Houthi drone ‘hits Saudi arms depot’ (DW) Iran-aligned Houthi rebels say 
they have ﬂown a bomb-laden drone into an airport with a military base in Saudi 
Arabia. This comes amid a recent spike in tensions between the regional rivals. 
Houthi-run Masirah TV said on Tuesday that the Yemeni rebel group had launched 
a drone attack on Najran airport in Saudi Arabia which caused a ﬁre to break out at 
the facility. 
The airport is located in the city of Najran on the Saudi-Yemen border, an area 
that has repeatedly been targeted by Houthi rebels. 
Saudi government spokesman Colonel Turki al-Maliki said the Houthis “had tried to 
target” a civilian site in Najran and there would be a “strong deterrent” to such attacks. 
Regional rivals Last Tuesday, Riyadh claimed that two oil pumping stations – 
which maintain the ﬂow rates of a major Saudi oil pipeline – were hit by armed 
drones, resulting in a ﬁre at one of the stations and a temporary shutting of the oil 
line as a precaution. 
Earlier this month, Saudi Arabia claimed that two of its oil tankers were targeted 
in a “sabotage attack” off the coast of the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The UAE is 
investigating the alleged attack near its waters, which also targeted two other tankers.

Mohamed Morsi ousted in Egypt’s second revolution in two years (The Guardian) A 
polarized Egypt is facing the most critical phase of its post-revolutionary life after 
Egypt’s army ousted the country’s elected president, Mohamed Morsi, and sched­
uled fresh elections in a what was labeled by the presidency as a “full coup.” 
The chief of the armed forces, General Abdel-Fatah al-Sisi, announced that he had 
suspended the constitution and would nominate the head of the constitutional court, 
Adli Mansour, as interim president on Thursday. Both presidential and parliamentary 
elections would follow shortly afterwards and a transitional cabinet would be named. 
A statement on the former president’s Twitter and Facebook accounts labeled the 
military move a “full coup,” after Morsi was ofﬁcially deposed from ofﬁce at 7pm. 
In the early evening, a presidential aide told the Guardian Morsi was still free, but 
late on Wednesday night a Muslim Brotherhood spokesman said Morsi was being 
held by the authorities in an unknown location. 
Sisi strove to paint the coup as the fulﬁllment of the popular will, following days 
of vast protests against Morsi’s rule.

Passage Two 
Yes, Yemen’s revolution was worth it – despite everything that came next (The Wash­
ington Post) Six years ago, in January 2011, a peaceful revolution erupted in 
Yemen. Our popular uprising bore many similarities to those sweeping other 
Arab countries at the same time, a phenomenon that came to be known as the 
Arab Spring. Like its counterparts elsewhere, Yemen’s revolution was the inevi­
table response to a regime that had turned the country into a failed dynastic state 
ruled by corruption and nepotism. 
Yemenis succeeded in toppling the dictator Ali Abdullah Saleh and launching 
a democratic transition. They created a multiparty national unity government that 
represented a wide range of political forces from across the country. In spite of many 
difﬁculties, Yemen’s people experienced signiﬁcant if modest progress in the obser­
vance of basic human rights and civil liberties. 
Yemenis of all walks of life enjoyed their freedoms and rights without any 
limitations. This was perhaps the greatest and most signiﬁcant achievement of 
our peaceful revolution. As the revolution proceeded, Yemenis from all over 
the country participated in a comprehensive national dialogue that reﬂected the 
widespread desire for a modern civil state. This dialogue ultimately produced the 
text of a draft constitution. A national referendum on the new constitution was 
set to take place within the next few months, to be followed by local and national 
elections.

Combating terrorism 
Passage one 
Trump: US needs Saudi Arabia in war on terror (Gulf News) Washington/Riyadh: 
US President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that America needs Saudi Ara­
bia in the ﬁght against terrorism, and that he did not want to walk away from the 
kingdom. 
“You know we need Saudi Arabia in terms of our ﬁght against all of the terrorism, 
everything that’s happening in Iran and other places,” Trump told Fox Business in 
response to questions about missing Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. 
The US president said he did not want to walk away from Saudi Arabia. “They 
have a tremendous order, $110 billion,” he said, in reference to US arms sales to the 
Kingdom. 
Meanwhile, Turkish Justice Minister Abdul Hamid Gul called on the pub­
lic to ignore any leaked information in the case of Khashoggi. Several news 
outlets have released reports quoting anonymous official sources who claimed 
to have found breaking evidence in the case. However, no concrete evidence 
has surfaced indicating any information about who is behind Khashoggi’s 
disappearance. 
Gul said the case was being “thoroughly” investigated and “results are expected 
to come out soon.” 
The Istanbul prosecutors’ ofﬁce will reveal the truth behind Khashoggi’s disap­
pearance and whatever the international law requires will be done, he added.

Passage two 
The ﬁght against terror needs better data (foreign policy) Terrorist attacks are 
becoming commonplace across the world. In recent years, attacks have wreaked 
havoc in iconic tourist destinations such as Paris and Barcelona and have routinely 
devastated communities in cities such as Kabul and Baghdad. 
Clearly, current methods of intervention are failing to prevent young extrem­
ists from joining radical groups. As the war in Syria winds down, it is imperative 
that policymakers shape their counter-radicalization efforts through data-driven and 
geographically targeted strategies to prevent a future exodus of young people seek­
ing to join the Islamic State or extremist groups in other lawless regions. 
Terrorist attacks have risen sharply in the past decade. According to the Uni­
versity of Maryland’s Global Terrorism Database, while annual terrorism attacks 
numbered under 3,000 between the 1970s and 2000s, since 2010 they have shot up 
to more than 10,000 annually on average.

TRANSLATING LEGAL TEXTS 
3.1 Introduction 
Legal translation can be simply deﬁned as the translation of legal texts such as wit­
ness statements, contracts, ﬁled patents, transcripts, ofﬁcial reports, and ﬁnancial 
documents. The legal profession continues to play an undeniably signiﬁcant role in 
promoting cooperation and business between individuals and institutions interna­
tionally. Alcaraz and Hughes (2014 , p. 24) say that: 
Like translators, all practising lawyers, and judges most speciﬁcally, are pro­
fessionally engaged in the task of interpreting the meaning of texts, and of par­
ticular words in particular texts. To interpret, in general, is to assign a meaning 
to a word, phrase, clause, sentence or utterance, and, where two or more mean­
ings are possible, either to decide between them or to declare the utterance 
indeterminably ambiguous. 
Treaties between governments and private bodies are primarily designed to pro­
mote cooperation at different levels on various matters such as combating terror­
ism, money laundering, human trafﬁcking, drug-smuggling, etc. Be they between 
individuals or institutions, agreements require the cooperative efforts of lawyers, 
courts, and police who depend on the work of translators. The agreements between 
governments and private institutions in the Arab world and the English-speaking 
countries are beyond count. These cover a wide range of mutually agreed upon inter­
ests, including peace and trade. In this context, the legal profession provides work 
through drafting and constant amendment of international treaties such as those that 
govern the relation between, say, the UN or Security Council and the governments 
in the Arab world. Various international legal and administrative institutions rely 
heavily on the work of professional translators, which highlights the importance of 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
90 Translating legal texts 
legal translation for governmental and private bodies internationally. People’s need 
for interaction for social, political, and economic reasons has highlighted the need 
for legal translation. Despite the large volume of legal translation work between 
English and Arabic, this translation type remains a challenge to even experienced 
translators due to a number of factors, including different legal systems, lexical 
and syntactic features, and translators’ familiarity with Arabic and English legal 
discourses. These factors should be taken into consideration collectively to ensure 
rendering acceptable translations. 
3.2 Legal translation: sources of difculty 
 The difﬁculty of legal translation lies in the complexity of legal language and the 
nature of law. What adds to the complexity of the industry of legal translation is the 
inseparable link between language and culture on the one hand and law and culture 
on the other. Despite the fact that legal translation is not concerned about transmit­
ting culture, the interlingual transfer with respect to legal texts is challenged by the 
relative inability to achieve a legal effect in the target language similar to the effect 
achieved by the source language legal text. Therefore, translating legal documents 
can lead to serious consequences at home and abroad. In this context, Sarcevic 
(1997 , p. 1) explains that “Translations of legal texts lead to legal effects and may 
even induce peace or prompt a war.” Kuner (1991, p. 953 quoted in  Sarcevic, 1997 , 
p. 1) says that “The growing trend toward providing authentic texts of treaties in 
four or more languages poses dangers to the peace and stability of the international 
order.” It stands to reason that legal translation is a signiﬁcant challenge, which 
necessitates carrying out the translation tasks by professional translators only. 
The lexical and syntactic ambiguity of legal discourse can lead to adverse conse­
quences if translators attempt to resolve such ambiguity. Alcaraz and Hughes (2014 , 
p. 45) explain that: 
[s]ince the ambiguity is inherent in the syntactic structure of the sentence, any 
translation that reproduces this is bound to be correct, in the sense that it will 
be equally ambiguous, and for the same reason. And that is what translators 
must do in cases of this kind, since it is no part of their business to decide 
between alternatives. 
Translation of legal texts highlights the critical importance of legal language, which 
Mellinkoff (1963 , p. 3) calls “the language of law,” used for speciﬁc purposes and 
functions. The key role of language in normative legal texts (establishing or con­
forming to certain norms) is to prescribe legal actions aimed at achieving a speciﬁc 
goal ( Sarcevic, 1997 ). Similarly, legal texts have an informative function for the 
general reader and a directive one for a speciﬁc group of people (Sager, 1993, p. 70, 
in Sarcevic, 1997 , p. 10). The nature, purpose, and function of different legal texts 
pose speciﬁc challenges for translators as will be shown next. 

 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Translating legal texts 91 
Diferent languages and legal systems 1 
Altarabin (2018 ) explains that translation equivalence is the ultimate objective 
translators seek to achieve regardless of text types. When translating legal docu­
ments, such an objective can sometimes be impossible to accomplish, especially 
in a language pair like English and Arabic, due to the lexical, syntactic, and sty­
listic features of legal texts and the different legal systems that pose considerable 
challenges to legal translators. Sarcevic (1997 , p. 235) points out that the inherent 
lack of match of the terminology of different legal systems affects legal translators’ 
ability to use natural equivalents in the target legal system that correspond to their 
source terms at the conceptual level. Sarcevic (1997 ) maintains that differences in 
legal systems and culture can result in challenges to translators of legal texts. To her, 
“Each national or municipal law . . . constitutes an independent legal system with 
its own terminological apparatus, and underlying conceptual structure, its own rules 
of classiﬁcation, sources of law, methodological approaches, and socio-economic 
principles” (p. 13). Differences among legal systems can pose signiﬁcant challenges 
given the independent conceptual structure and source of legal systems. This is fur­
ther stressed by Yankova (2017 ) who notes that what complicates the rendering of 
a legal text into another language is the difference in the semantic domains of the 
legal terms in two legal systems. Such terms do not correspond due to the difference 
of the legal conceptualization of the systems. 
The sources of difﬁculty in translating legal texts can be attributed to different 
legal systems, linguistic differences, cultural differences ( Cao, 2007 ), and the nature 
of law ( Tetley, 2000 ). In addition, the content of legal systems can also play a vital 
role in translating legal texts. Legal English is related to the common law where 
concepts can be understood in the context of common law only ( Volker, 2009 ). 
Legal Arabic, on the other hand, is usually linked to the two major sources of legis­
lation: Quran and Sunnah on the one hand and civil laws on the other. 
It is the difference between legal systems in the Arab world and those in the 
English-speaking countries that makes it difﬁcult to render legal terms or texts. In 
addition, differences may lead to legal effects at home and abroad. Laws are deeply 
rooted in the religious and cultural traditions of the Arab and non-Arab countries, 
which shifts the focus of rendering lexical units into rendering legal systems. 
The difference in legal systems is strongly linked to differences in legal terms 
between source and target languages, an aspect that certainly complicates the work 
of legal translators. White (1982 ) stresses that the invisibility of legal discourse 
is problematic due to the explicit conventions that govern the functioning of lan­
guage, vocabulary selection, and sentence structure employed in law.  Bhatia (1997 ) 
believes that translators of legal texts make connections between language use and 
purpose of communication. This does not necessarily mean achieving equivalence 
in rendering legal texts. Cao (2007 , p. 25) afﬁrms that “A basic linguistic difﬁculty 
in legal translation is the absence of equivalent terminology across different lan­
guages. This requires constant comparison between the legal systems of the source 
language (SL) and target language (TL).” Linguistic difﬁculties found in legal

translation are usually attributed to the different concepts used speciﬁcally in one 
legal system, Arabic or English. 
Intra-system diferences 
Translators’ familiarity with the differences within one legal system is essential 
for rendering a translation that suits a particular legal system. Although such 
familiarity may require a degree in law, extensive reading on the topic can facili­
tate the task. Husni and Newman (2015 ) point out that common law and civil law 
are the two main legal systems in use today. Legislation in the US is divided into 
federal law, which applies to all states, and state law, which applies to particular 
states. The uniqueness of the legal system in Canada lies in the use of English and 
French as two ofﬁcial languages on the one hand and common law and civil law 
on the other. 
In the Arab world, the civil law in Algeria, Morocco, Syria, and Tunisia is 
inﬂuenced by the French law while Oman’s legal system is inﬂuenced by the 
English Common Law ( Husni & Newman, 2015 ). Legal terminologies of differ­
ent legal systems reﬂect the distinctiveness of such systems. Brierley and David 
(1985 , p. 19) explain that each system “has a vocabulary to express concepts, 
its roles are arranged into categories, it has techniques for expressing rules and 
interpreting them.” 
The task of the translators of legal texts is complicated by the differences that 
occur within a speciﬁc legal system, “resulting in often dramatically varying termi­
nologies relating to the legal profession, courts and areas of law” ( Husni & New­
man, 2015 , p. 108). An example of intra-system terminological difference is the use 
of lawyer, attorney, solicitor, barrister, advocate, and counselor and counsel in the 
( Husni ﻣﺤﺎﻣﻲ
 UK and US. These words can be generally translated into Arabic as  
& Newman, 2015 ). However, they are not synonyms, and therefore the inaccurate 
usage of any term can lead to undesirable implications. Whereas  lawyer and attor­
ney (law) are synonyms in the US, only lawyer is used in UK in the same sense. In 
the UK, attorney refers someone acting on behalf of another person. Attorney can

 be translated into Arabic as  
This necessitates taking the contextual usage
.وﻛﯿﻞ
 attorney-in-fact
thus becoming 
of legal terms into careful consideration, especially when dealing with extremely 
divergent legal systems in the Arab world and abroad. 
In England, Canada, and New Zealand, “there has traditionally been a contrast 
between solicitors (lawyers who advise clients) and barristers (lawyers who advo­
cate in a legal hearing)” ( Day & Krois-Lindner, 2008 , p. 18).  Advocate is the generic 
term in Scotland and refers to a member of the bar.  Counsel is used in Queen’s 
Counsel and denotes a senior barrister, with  counselor being synonymous with law­

Court names are likely to be different in various countries.  Husni and Newman 
(2015 , p. 109) show the difference between the hierarchical structure of courts in 
different English-speaking countries. The differences between courts in Canada and 
US are as follows: 
Canada: Supreme Court, Federal Court of Appeal, Federal Court, Provincial/ 
Territorial Court 
US: Supreme Court, State Supreme Courts, District Court, Country Courts 
Equally challenging are the terms referring to legislative institutions in the Arab

Iraq, House of Representatives in Jordan, Morocco and Yemen,  National Assembly 
in Lebanon, Chamber of Deputies in Tunisia,  General People’s Congress in Libya, 
and People’s Assembly in Egypt and Syria ( Husni & Newman, 2015 , p. 110). 
Familiarity with legal terminology 
Familiarity with legal terminology plays a major role in translating legal documents 
between English and Arabic. That said, replacing a term with another can confuse 
readers, because some Arab countries use different terms or names of courts. 
Trosborg (1997 , p. 156) points out that “The translation of legal texts presupposes 
familiarity with specialized terminology.  . . . The distinctive lexical features of legal 
vocabulary must be part of the translation competence of the legal translator.” She 
maintains that different concepts that result from the difference in legal systems 
must be explained. Smith (1995 , p. 181, in  Bhatia et al., 2008 , p. 305) identiﬁes 
“three prerequisites for the successful translation of legal texts: (a) basic knowledge 
of respective legal systems, (b) familiarity with the relevant terminology, and (c) 
competence in target language’s speciﬁc legal style of writing.” Translators must 
acquaint themselves with the legal concepts and terms in the SL and TL. 
Detailed knowledge of concepts and topics is essential for translating legal texts. 
Ahmad and Rogers (2007 , p. 449) say: 
Translation of legal texts should not be done without quite extensive knowledge 
of the respective legal topic in both the SL and the TL, i.e. the knowledge of 
concepts, terms denoting the concepts, sentence patterns visualizing the infor­
mation, genre classiﬁcation of the text, and the knowledge of legal culture. 
Commenting on Laura Nader’s article entitled  The Unspoken Language of Law, 
Durant and Leung (2018 , p. 19) say: 
In claiming that there is to this extent a risk of deception inherent in the core 
terminology of legal discourse, Nader’s opening essay to the volume argues 
that justice is denied on numerous occasions in the United States because what 
needs to be said is left unsaid.

Table 3.1 from Husni and Newman (2015 , p. 115) reﬂects the variance in the use of 
some basic legal terms across the Arab world. 
The table is self-explanatory. Looking at the translation of  chapter and article

consideration should be taken into account when translating the English ST term in

The translation of certain English court names into Arabic can be troublesome or 
even judged inaccurate because a name of an English court can be translated differ­

The need for legal translation is continuously increasing, which necessitates con­
tact and transactions between the Arab countries on the one hand and Arab coun­
tries and countries outside the Arab world on the other. What complicates the task 
of legal translators is that the selection of a term or a phrase is mainly determined 
by conventions rather than semantics. Translators need to search for recognized

Egypt, Qatar, Bahrain, and Kuwait. Such Sharia courts’ rulings are not binding in 
the English-speaking countries or countries where Sharia law is not the applicable 
legal system. 
Schäffner (1997 ) and  Legrand (2005 ) argue that concepts have meanings only 
when they are embedded in socioculturally determined frames. Nothing reﬂects that 
legal concepts necessarily replicate themselves in different legal systems. 
The legal systems in the Arab world are different and can depend on varying 
sources in the absence of speciﬁc legal stipulations to address certain matters. For 
example, the Egyptian civil law of 1948 relies on conventions as a ﬁrst option if no 
legislation on a certain matter exists. However, the Jordanian civil law of 1976 relies 
on the Islamic ﬁqh as the ﬁrst option in the absence of stipulations in the civil law 
to address a certain matter. 
Legal systems can vary considerably in the English-speaking countries. The legal 
system adopted in the United States is a common law system except for the state of 
Louisiana, which adopts a mix of common law and civil law. The UK does not have 
a single legal system. England and Wales adopt a common law system; Scotland 
enforces a mixed legal system combining elements of civil law and common law. 
The UK legal system, like other systems, may be updated to accommodate new 
developments, which require updating the legal system as in the case with anti-
terrorism legislation. 
The difference in the legal systems at home and abroad stresses the need for 
translators’ awareness of the legal system as a basic requirement for carrying out 
translations of legal documents. Awareness of legal terminologies is a key element 
in the process of rendering legal texts between English and Arabic.

3.3 Features of English legalese 
Lexical features 
The lexical features of English and Arabic legalese set legal texts apart from other 
general or technical texts. Being the basic units of language, words are the tools of 
law and are extremely important in the study of law. Highlighting the importance of 
legal language, Sarcevic (1997 , p. 1) says “Translation of legal texts leads to legal 
effects and may even induce peace or prompt a war.” The complexity of legal trans­
lation lies in the syntax and semantics of legal texts, which are different from other 
text types, say ordinary English. Legal texts are formulated in a special language 
known as the language of law ( Mellinkoff (1963 ). 2 Sarcevic (1997 , p. 133) argues 
that “the primary role of language in normative legal texts is to prescribe legal 
actions, the performance of which is intended to achieve a speciﬁc goal.” Tiersma 
(1999 , p. 49) explains that legal language follows the rules that generally govern 
English and diverges from ordinary speech far more than the technical language of 
any other profession. Legal texts have different functions for different readers. They 
have an informative function for the general reader and a directive one for a speciﬁc 
group of people (Sager, 1993, p. 70 in  Sarcevic, 1997 , p. 10). 
Legal English, also known as legalese, is characterized by distinctive lexical and 
syntactic features that set it apart from other texts types. Tiersma (1999 , p. 1) points 
out that “Words are also a lawyer’s most essential tools. Attorneys use language to 
discuss what the law means, to advise clients, to argue before a court or jury, and 
to question witnesses.” Hiltunen (1990 , p. 84) explains that the vocabulary of legal 
English texts are fairly scarce, imprecise, and vague. This indicates the complexity of 
legal terminology that, in the absence of thorough understanding, leads to inaccurate 
renderings of SL legal texts. The vocabulary used in legal documents is “a vocabu­
lary of possibilities purportedly comprising a comprehensive system of meanings 
that are internal or latent within the lexicon itself” ( Goodrich, 1987 , p. 177). 
Contextual meaning: The meaning of words in legal documents can vary consider­
ably from their meaning in ordinary texts. Examples of these include: 
Assignment generally means work given to someone as part of study or job as in: 
In the legal context, however,  an assignment means transferring the rights held by one 
ﺗﺤﻮ
ا ﻧﻘﻞ /ﯾﻞ
ﻟﻤﻠﻜﯿﺔ
 party (assignor) to another party (assignee). As such, the word means  
Issue when used in wills means descendants and is translated into Arabic as 
.ﻧﺴﻞ
/
ورﯾﺚ
 
Archaic words: Legal discourse is marked by the use of old words. English legal 
texts reﬂect the use of old vocabulary items ( Alcaraz & Hughes, 2014 , p. 5). These,

Word pairs (doublets and triplets): Danet (1984 , p. 281) explains that word pairs

tions and bequest, will and testament, full, true and correct. Consider the following

Latin and French lexical items: The legal language changed due to conquests over 
centuries. Following the Norman invasion, the Anglo-Norman French language was 
adopted as the ofﬁcial language of the legal proceedings. Haigh (2015 , p. 4) explains 
that “legal English owes a particular debt to French and Latin.” French words used 
in English legal texts include property, estate, lease, tenant, and executor. Some 
words of Latin origin include adjacent and subscribe. 
Formality: Examples of lexical items that reﬂect the high level of formality 
include contractor, attorney, and devisee. Names of legal documents also reﬂect 
formality, such as  warranty deed, real estate deed, will, and life assignment deed. 
His/Her Imperial and Royal Majesty and His Highness are examples of the for­
mality of titles.

Frequent use of  any is another lexical feature of the English legal documents. 
Examples include any child or children, any other assets, any breach , etc. 
Use of performative verbs 
Alcaraz and Hughes (2014 , p. 11, quoting Austin, 1962) explain that performative 
utterances commit the speaker to carry out the actions expressed by the words. When 
a court gives a judgment on a certain issue, the judgment comes into effect through 
pronouncing the operative words. The authors provide examples of performative 
verbs such as agree, admit, declare, undertake, certify, among other examples. Con­

Despite the fact that the features of legal English discussed so far set it apart from 
other text types, these may render English legal texts inaccessible due to the vague­
ness of some lexical items or the speciﬁc contextual meanings associated with the 
same. Plain English Campaign is a UK-based organization that advocates for plain 
language usage. In this context, Triebel (2009 ) argues that many common law terms

100 Translating legal texts 
Translating  shall and may 
The translation of shall can be confusing and challenging because the word does not 
adhere to consistency and is, therefore, a source of litigation in many jurisdictions. 
Shall, the most commonly used of all modals, has ﬂourished in legal English for 
hundreds of years ( Williams, 2005 , in  Bhatia et al., 2008 , p. 201). The meaning of 
the word can vary according to the type of law.  Black (1968 ) explains that  shall is 
imperative in statues and contracts. 
Shall as a verb means “has a duty to” as in “notice shall be sent” ( Garner, 2009 , 
p. 1499). The word can also mean  may as in “no person shall enter the building 
without ﬁrst signing the roster” or will as in “the corporation shall then have a period 
of 30 days to object.” Furthermore, shall can mean is entitled to as in “the secretary 
shall be reimbursed for all the expenses.” Shall means that something is legally 
binding ( Tiersma, 1999 ). The obligation in the use of  shall is further stressed by 
Haigh (2015 ) who explains that future obligations are often expressed using  shall. 
The author provides the following example: 
X shall deliver the Goods to Y on 7 March 2016. This can be translated into 
Arabic as: 
ﯾﻨﺒﻐﻲ
ﻋﻠﻰ 
 X ﺗﺴﻠﯿﻢ
 
اﻟﺒﻀﺎﺋﻊ
 ل
 Y ﯾﻮم
 7 ﻣﺎرس
 2016.

Shall is not needed if there is no element of futurity in the agreed obligation ( Haigh, 
2015 , p. 142). Consider the following example: 
A hereby grants B an exclusive license to manufacture, use and sell the Licensed 
Products in the Territory. 
The sentence can be translated into Arabic as:

The preceding examples reﬂect that translators need to be familiar with the usage of 
shall to avoid producing a meaning not intended in the ST. Taking the legal effects 
into account, an obligation needs to be rendered as an obligation, an entitlement to 
a right must be preserved in the TT, and the ST sense of futurity reﬂected in the use 
of shall needs to be accounted for in the TT. 
Haigh (2009 , p. 120) lists the uses of  may as follows: 
1 
Expressing the ability of doing something as in the company may purchase the 
products. 
2 
Showing that one has discretion to do something as in the parties to this con­
tract may assign the beneﬁts under this contract. 
3 
Indicating a wish as in the parties intend that the signature of this contract may 
signal the beginning of a mutually beneﬁcial cooperation between them. 
Husni and Newman (2015 , p. 138) highlighted the use of  shall and may in legal text. 
These are presented in Figure 3.1.

Syntactic features 
The syntactic structures of legal discourse can be a source of difﬁculty for legal 
translators. Danet (1984 , p. 281) says that the “syntactic features are probably more 
distinctive of legal English than are lexical ones, and certainly account for more of 
the difﬁculties of laypersons in comprehending it.” Following are some of the com­
mon features of English legalese syntax adopted from Alcaraz and Hughes (2014 ). 
Sentence length 
Alcaraz and Hughes (2014 , p. 18) stated that “One section of the British Drug Traf­
ﬁcking Act is a single highly complex sentence of over 250 words in length.” They 
added that the syntax of British statues is characterized by the complexity of layout, 
multiple subordination, and postponement of the main verb. 
Use of restrictive connectors 
 British Drug Trafﬁcking Act reﬂects a main feature of legal English morphology, 
which lies in the abundant use of restrictive connectors. Examples of these include 
notwithstanding, under, having regard to, whereas , etc. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
Translating legal texts 103 
The meaning of notwithstanding in certain contexts can be challenging to even 
professional translators. For illustration, let us consider the following example: 
Notwithstanding any contract term to the contrary (from Carr and Goldby, 2014 , 
p. 629). 
The phrase means that there can be a contract term before the word notwith­
standing that can be contradictory to what follows. This may be rendered 
into Arabic as: 
ﺑﺼﺮف
 
اﻟﻨﻈﺮ
 ﻓﻲ ﺑﻨﺪ  أي ﻋﻦ 
اﻟﻌﻘﺪ
 ﻗﺪ 
ﯾﺨﺎﻟﻒ
 
اﻵﺗﻲ
 .... 
Abundant use of passive voice 
Alcaraz and Hughes (2014 , p. 19) explain that “it is undoubtedly true that one com­
mon effect of the passive mood is to suppress the identity of the agent responsible for 
the performance of the act.” They provided the following example for illustration: 
No person has been authorized to give any information . . . 
ﯾ ﻟﻢ
ُﺨﻮل
أﺣﺪ 
 
ﺑﺘﻘﺪﯾﻢ
  أﯾﺔ 
ﻣﻌﻠﻮﻣﺎت
 
 . . .
Conditionals 
Alcaraz and Hughes (2014 , p. 20) argue that exceptions should be provided for in 
texts like contracts and procedural rules. This results in a language characterized by 
“syntactic indicators of condition and hypothesis” which can be positive as in the 
use of (if, when, where, whenever, wherever, provided that, assuming that, should or 
negative conditionals such as unless, failing, should . . . not . . ., except as/where/if, 
and so on. Translators should carefully deal with complex conditions when two or 
three hypotheses as well as positive and negative possibilities are used in the text. 
Following is an example of a passage containing complex conditions from 
Alcaraz and Hughes (2014 , p. 20): 
Where either party fails to perform their side of the bargain, then,  subject to 
clause 15 above, if notice of non-performance is given in writing by the injured 
party within seven days, or,  in the event that communication is impossible until 
the ship reaches a port of call, as soon thereafter as is practically possible, the 
injured party shall be entitled to treat the contract as discharged  except as oth­
erwise provided in this contract. 
The passage contains three positive conditionals (where, if, in the event that) and 
one negative connector (except). The passage can be rendered into Arabic as:

Capitalization 
In legal discourse, all proper names including the names of individuals and corpora­
tions must be in solid caps4 ( Cummins, 1997 ). Consider the following example: 5 
IN THE HIGH COURT OF JUSTICE 
 CHANCERY DIVISION 
BETWEEN:-
 SKYLET ANDREW 
 Claimant / Applicant 
and 
(1) NEWS GROUP NEWSPAPERS LIMITED 
(2) GLENN MICHAEL MULCAIRE 
Defendants 
It is important to note that capitalization rules may vary from one country to another. 
Thus, the description of the parties to a deed may be FIRST PART or First Party, 
EMPLOYER or Employer, SELLER or Seller, etc. One should carefully follow the 
established conventions in this regard. 
Active and passive parties 
Alcaraz and Hughes (2014 , p. 22) say that the sufﬁxes “-er” (or “-or”) and “-ee” are 
a feature of the legal relationship that is added to the appropriate verb to identify the 
active and passive parties. The party granting a right is called  grantor and the party 
receiving the right is called grantee. Other examples include promisor/promisee, 
licensor/licensee, and drawer/drawee. 
Testing clauses 
The testing clause in English legal discourse refers to the last clause in a deed, 
which is placed after the main operative part of the deed. It begins with “IN 
WITNESS WHEREOF” to indicate that the preceding operative part has ended. 
No further clauses can be added after the testing clause which contains the 
names of parties and their signatures. Consider the following example of a test­
ing clause: 
• 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF the parties have executed this Agreement as of the 
date ﬁrst above written.

3.4 Features of Arabic legalese 
Despite the similarities existing between Arabic and English legal discourses, Arabic 
legalese features speciﬁc structures. The distinctive features of Arabic legal discourse are 
attributed to form, style, meaning, and text organization.  Emery (1989 , p. 10) states that: 
Arabic legal texts exhibit their own features of structure and style. They make 
more use of grammatical cohesion (through reference and conjunction) and 
of ﬁnite structures than their English counterparts, and less use of passives. In 
addition, they are not characterized by the use of archaic vocabulary and mor­
phology. The two languages differ in their patterns of nominalization, creation 
of binominals and in their use of highlighting and text markers. 
Lexical features 
Semantic range 
A word semantic range is the sum of all possible meanings a word possesses in 
different contexts. Practically, words can be classiﬁed as (1) technical, (2) semi-
technical, and (3) common or everyday vocabulary. Examples of Arabic purely legal 
vocabulary include: 
• 
 is a technical term used in Arabic legal discourse the English اﻹﻓﺮاج
 
اﻟﺸﺮﻃﻲ
 
equivalent of which is conditional release. 
ﯾﻘﺼﺪ

إﻃﻼق

Conditional release means releasing the prisoner before the full sentence is served. 
•

 .
The judge sentenced him to a ﬁve-year imprisonment. 
Arabic legalese can contain semi-technical vocabulary where words have certain 
meanings in everyday language and different meanings in the legal context. Con­
:إﻗﺮار

The preceding is an example of a phrase used in Sharia court documents in Pales­
can mean ﻃﻠﺐ
 tine and some other Arab countries. In non-legal discourse, the word  
request or application. The meaning of the word changes to claimant’s statement 
adop-
generally means إﻗﺮار
 when used in the legal context. The word  
of claims 
tion, approval, recognition, etc. In Sharia discourse, however, the word refers to the 
defendant’s admission of claimant’s statement of claims. 
Arabic legal discourse can also include everyday vocabulary such as: 
• 
 (war) is an example of an Arabic everyday lexical unit which does not ﺣﺮب
 
have a speciﬁc meaning when used in legal texts. Consider the following 
example: 
اﻟﺤﺮب
 ﻫﻲ 
ﻧﺰاع
 
ﻣﺴﻠﺢ
 ﺑﯿﻦ 
دوﻟﺘﯿﻦ
  أو 
أﻛﺜﺮ
 .
 •
War is an armed conﬂict between two or more countries. 
Features of literary Arabic 
Arabic legal discourse contains vocabulary that is common to literary texts. Con­
sider the following example from the Egyptian constitution of 2014: 
 ﻓﻲ

Islamic and cultural terms 
Arabic legal discourse features the use of Islamic and cultural expressions that spe­
ciﬁcally abound in Sharia court documents. Consider the Islamic expressions from 
a marriage deed issued by the Saudi Arabian Ministry of Justice: 6 
اﻟﺤﻤﺪ

Formal expressions

honorary titles and forms of address used to express formality are more dominant in 
Arabic legal discourse. Consider the following examples of honorary titles:

Syntactic features 
Arabic legal discourse features syntactic structures that considerably differ from the 
syntax of ordinary language where special focus is given to addressee, verb forms, 
sentence length, and negation. The following are the main syntactic features of Ara­
bic legalese. 
Legal agent 
The legal agent in Arabic legal discourse refers to a person who is entitled to cer­
tain rights or a person who is legally committed to fulﬁll speciﬁc duties. The agent 
is generally marked for singular number for simplicity and clarity. However, spe­
ciﬁc reference shall be made to contract parties who are mentioned together in cer­
tain clauses. A party can be repeated in the same article. Consider the following 
examples:

omitted in cases of obligation. Consider the following examples:

Passivation 
Arabic does not favor the use of passive constructions. Legal discourse features the 
use of active voice to clearly identify the party entitled to a right or obliged to fulﬁll 
an obligation. However, one many notice the minimal use of passive structures in 
Arabic legalese. Consider the following:

of two words. Some examples indicate that a group of words can be used collec­
tively in a legal text. Consider the following examples:

Absence of modality 
Contrary to English legal discourse, Arabic legalese does not involve the use 
of modals. English modal verbs in legal discourse are translated into Ara­
bic main verbs. Consider the following English examples and their Arabic 
translations: 
• 
To qualify, the Heir Apparent  must  have attained the age of majority,  must be 
endowed with reason and must be a legitimate son of Muslim parents.16

3.5 Classiﬁcation of legal texts 
Husni and Newman (2015 , p. 95) classify legal texts based on function into pre­
scriptive or descriptive texts. Prescriptive texts are regulatory23 documents impos­
ing certain obligations on the parties concerned. Noncompliance with the provisions 
of prescriptive texts such as constitutions, treaties, laws, and contracts normally 
carries a sanction. 
Descriptive texts include ofﬁcial requests, afﬁdavits, and complaints of no nor­
mative dimension, but are still treated as legal instruments. Descriptive legal texts 
can be: 
• 
Declarative, which constitute statements or declarations within a legal context, 
such as a witness statement or afﬁdavit; 
• 
Directive, which involve instructing or getting other parties to perform a par­
ticular activity, e.g., a lawyer’s brief; 
• 
Exhortatory, which aim to incite action on a particular issue, e.g., petitions; 
• 
Expressive, which convey a speaker’s psychological state or attitude towards 
something, e.g., closing arguments of a trial; 
• 
Commissive, which reﬂect a commitment on the part of the speaker, e.g., mar­
riage ceremony, wills. 
Sarcevic (1997 ) points out that legal translation can be classiﬁed according to ST 
functions into (1) primarily prescriptive, (2) primarily descriptive, and (3) purely 
descriptive. These can be represented in Figure 3.2.

3.6 Classiﬁcation of legal translation 
 Cao (2007 , pp. 9–10) classiﬁes legal translation according to the subject matter of 
the SL texts into 
(1) legislative texts, e.g. domestic statutes and subordinate laws, international 
treaties and multilingual laws, and other laws produced by lawmaking authori­
ties, (2) judicial texts produced in the judicial process by judicial ofﬁcers and 
other legal authorities; (3) legal scholarly texts produced by academic law­
yers or legal scholars in scholarly works and commentaries whose legal status 
depends on the legal systems in different jurisdictions; and (4) private legal 
texts that include texts written by lawyers, e.g. contracts, leases, wills and 
litigation documents, and also texts written by non-lawyers, e.g. private agree­
ments, witness statements and other documents produced by non-lawyers and 
used in litigation and other legal situations. 
 Cao (2007 , p. 10) classiﬁes legal texts according to the communicative purpose 
as follows: 
• 
normative purpose as in the case of bilingual and multilingual statutes and other 
laws and documents that establish legal facts or create rights and obligations . . . 
• 
informative purpose as in some legal scholarly works and commentaries, legal 
advice, correspondence between lawyers, between lawyers and clients, and doc­
uments used in court proceedings. 
When legal texts are translated for a normative purpose, the ST and TT are equally binding. 
However, only the ST is binding when the translation is done for an informative purpose. 
Figure 3.3 outlines the classiﬁcation of legal text.

3.7 Legal translators 
The main task of translators, lawyers, and judges is to interpret the meaning of 
certain words in particular texts. During the process of interpretation, meaning is 
assigned to different text levels: word, phrase, clause, or sentence, where more 
than one meaning is possible. In many cases, the work of a judge depends heavily 
on the work of the translator who aims to achieve accurate linguistic equivalence 
in the target language. The judge, however, applies the linguistic equivalence 
achieved by the translator and delivers judgments according to the legal princi­
ples. Translators and judges’ tasks are strongly linked together in the case of inter­
nal law. Aust and Nolte (2016, p. 276) believe that “we understand the process 
by which domestic judges interpret the international law as one of ‘translation,’ 
which in turn implies that the result of this process is not necessarily one which 
will produce greater uniformity. 
It is mandatory that legal translators possess linguistic skills and basic under­
standing of source and target legal systems.  Smith (1995 , p. 181) proposes two 
main prerequisites to successfully translate legal texts: (1) legal translator’s 
understanding of SL and TL legal system and (2) familiarity with the relevant 
legal terminology. Legal translators should also be able to extract information 
from STs and render the same pursuant to TL legal norms. The major problem 
with legal translation is that translators cannot reach consensus on the equiva­
lence of a given term without the help of experts on the source and target lan­
guage legal texts. Once deﬁned, a term generally remains intact. Alcaraz and 
Hughes (2014 , p. 25) believe that terms “in legal texts  . . . are being continually 
redeﬁned, as social developments overtake past practice and thus force legisla­
tion to change.” 
3.8 Translating legal documents 
The translation of legal documents is not restricted to a certain legal text. However, 
some texts may create more demand for translation than others. The following sec­
tions are designed for the translation of various Arabic and English legal documents, 
including contracts, agreements, and Sharia court documents. 
Contracts: There are different types and layouts of contracts. The following are 
some of the main sections which can be included in a contract. 
Contract title: The title is written on the top of the ﬁrst page to identify the type 
of contract.

3.10 Important notes 
Translators and translation students need to pay special attention to the grammatical 
structures when they translate legal texts between English and Arabic. 
Note 1: Passive structures in English need not be translated as passive structures 
ﯾﻨﺒﻐﻲ
 ﻋﻠﻰ 
اﻟﺒﺎﺋﻊ
 notices are required to be sent by the seller
into Arabic. Example:  
إرﺳﺎل
 
اﻹﺷﻌﺎرات
 .
Note 2: Natural sentence structure in Arabic (SVO) must be followed. 
.اﺗﻔﻖ
 
اﻟﺒﺎﺋﻊ
 
واﻟﻤﺸﺘﺮي
 is odd in Arabic compared to  اﻟﺒﺎﺋﻊ
 
واﻟﻤﺸﺘﺮي
 
اﺗﻔﻘﺎ
 A sentence like  
Note 3: Arabic agreements or contracts are normally in the past passive form as in 
..
this agreement is entered into . 
whereas English present passive is used as in ﺑﺮ أُ/ﺮم أُﺑ
 ﻣﺖ
Note 4: Translators need to pay special attention to certain structures occurring 
in contracts or agreements to avoid misunderstanding, which can lead to serious 
implications. Consider the following example: 
Notwithstanding any other term or condition expressed or implied in this Agree­
ment to the contrary,  . . . .

3.14 Sharia court documents 
The semantic complexity of Sharia terms can pose serious challenges to translators 
who are strongly advised to familiarize themselves with the meaning of Sharia terms 
before attempting to translate the same into English. Despite the lack of English 
equivalents to almost all Sharia terms, the translation of such terms must account 
for the SL meanings. The following are examples of Sharia court documents from 
Palestine, the subjects of which are Sharia court decisions and certiﬁcates. The glos­
sary following each sample aims to facilitate translation into English.

TECHNICAL AND SCIENTIFIC 
TRANSLATION 
4.1 Introduction 
The role that technical and scientiﬁc translation plays in today’s age of information 
is becoming more important than ever before. This type of translation promotes the 
most signiﬁcant technological advances, which remarkably change our lives. Practi­
cally, these technological advances have transformed our experiences of basic life 
aspects such as learning environments and entertainment. The advances would not 
be possible without translation, the key role of which is sharing technical knowl­
edge. Byrne (2012 , p. 1) explains that: 
Virtually every aspect of our lives from education and work to entertainment, 
shopping and travel has been swept along by a seemingly unstoppable wave of 
new inventions and technological advances. What many people do not realize 
is that these inventions and advances are accompanied at almost every step of 
the way by translation in its capacity as a vehicle for disseminating scientiﬁc 
and technical knowledge. 
Tylor (1998 , p. 121) explains that the word  technical includes “scientiﬁc disciplines 
(medicine, physics, astronomy, chemistry, etc.), ﬁelds of applied technology (com­
puters, engineering, etc.) and even less obviously ‘scientiﬁc’ subjects such as geog­
raphy, economics, architecture and the like.” The author adds that technical writing 
is as old as literary writing. 
Dickins et al. (2017 , p. 230) distinguish between two basic types of technical 
texts: culturally common technical texts and culturally non-common technical texts. 
Culturally common technical texts address notions shared by the SL culture and the 
TL culture. Examples of such texts include natural scientiﬁc and mathematical texts. 
Culturally non-common technical texts, however, do not share basic notions in the 
SL and TL cultures. Dickins et al. (2017, pp. 230–231) explain that the problems 

 
 
 
  
 
 
 
  
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Technical and scientiﬁ c translation 177 
arising from the translation of culturally common technical texts relate to techni­
cal terms and genre. Examples of culturally non-common texts include the Islamic 
jurisprudence and Arabic traditional grammar. 
4.2 Lexical issues and text features 
Words used in technical and scientiﬁc texts can be a source of difﬁculty to transla­
tors who generally do not specialize in a speciﬁc type of such texts. The ﬁeld of 
technology and science contains terms that are only understood by professionals. 
Dickins et al. (2017 , p. 231) explain that technical texts are relatively inaccessible 
to non-specialist readers due to lexical and conceptual reasons. The authors add that 
the lexical problems of technical translation arise from using three types of ST terms: 
1 
Technical terms totally unfamiliar to the lay translator because they are used in 
technical contexts only 
2 
Technical terms familiar to the translator because they are used in non-technical 
contexts but look as if they are being used in some technically specialized way 
in the ST 
3 
Technical terms familiar to the translator because they are used in non-technical 
contexts but do not obviously look as if they are being used in some technically 
specialized way in the ST 
Dickins et al. (2017 , pp. 232–234) provide examples of the three types. The follow­
ing is the ﬁrst example containing the three types:

TT skin tests 
These tests are necessary for the study and investigation of some {allergic1} skin 
reactions. They are conducted in order to specify and diagnose the {allergenic1} 
or harmful substances, as for example in the case of {contact2} eczema, especially 
{occupational2}, in {chronic2} {urticaria1}, and in food or drug {allergies1}, or in 
{sensitivities1} to {bacteria3}, {fungi2}, or {yeasts2} and their products. 
Type one lexical items include

Technical and scientiﬁ c translation 
Type two lexical items include 
enzymes. اﻟﺨﻤﯿﺮات
 fungi, اﻟﻔﻄﻮر
 occupational, اﻟﻤﻬﻨﯿﺔ
 contact, اﻟﺘﻤﺎس
 
Type three examples are problematic because, as  Dickins et al. (2017 , p. 234) 
explain, translators may not recognize them as technical terms and render them 
is translated in the technical اﻟﺠﺮاﺛﯿﻢ
 depending on their general meaning. The word  
sense as bacteria. If translators fail to recognize this sense, they would possibly 
translate it as germs and thus render an inaccurate translation. 
Dickins et al. (2017 , p. 235) add that the conceptual problems related to techni­
cal translation arise from translators’ unfamiliarity with the knowledge taken for 
granted by experts. This highlights that translators’ familiarity with ST technical 
 ﻦَﱠ َﻤﺿterms is crucial for appropriately accounting for technical terms. The word  
used by sharia judges is a technical term that means ordering a party to a litigation 
to pay certain fees. Unfamiliarity with such terms may lead to translating the term 
, but the domi-
needle
is literally translated into English as إﺑﺮة

or

as 
nant meaning in the medical domain is syringe. 
Lexical features of technical English 
Every ﬁeld of knowledge uses certain terms that set it apart from other ﬁelds. A 
term can exist in two different domains of knowledge but with one meaning and 
interpretation for each. Disregarding its meaning in psychology,  depression can 
be used in economics to mean a long downturn in economic activity. It can also 
be used in the weather domain to mean a region of lower atmospheric pressure. 
Pinchuk (1977 , p. 165) lists the features of technical and scientiﬁc language as 
follows: 
1 
Technical language is a specialized language and, as opposed to ordinary lan­
guage, tends to become more specialized. 
2 
Technical language seeks to be economic in terms of using linguistic means. 
3 
Technical language avoids ordinary language associations and deﬁnes terms 
accurately. 
Simple and informative language 
Dickins et al. (2017 , p. 240) and Tylor (1998 , p. 121) say that the language used in 
English technical texts is informative and characterized by impersonal style. 
Use of metaphors 
Byrne (2012 ) explains that metaphors are used in scientiﬁc texts to put a concrete 
name to an abstract concept. Examples of well-known metaphors used in technical 
texts are Black Hole and Greenhouse Effect. Metaphors can be used to explain com­
plex processes depending on the readers’ existing knowledge.

 A signiﬁcant feature of scientiﬁc and technical texts lies in the terminology used. 
Newmark (1988 , p. 151) maintains that about 5 to 10% of a given text contains spe­
cialized terms. Examples of some technical terms and their translations into Arabic 
are given in Table 4.1. 
Exercise 1: translate the following sentences into Arabic 
1 
Comparative anatomy studies the similarities and differences in the anatomy of 
different species. 
2 
Rodenticides are pesticides which are used to kill rodents. 
Facts 
A key feature of technical and scientiﬁc texts is the presentation of facts. Such texts 
are objective in nature. Byrne (2012 , p. 53) provides the following example: 
The recommended dose is between 50 and 80 mg per liter of water. It can be 
translated into Arabic as: 
اﻟﺠﺮﻋﺔ
 
اﻟﻤﻮﺻﻰ
ﻫﻲ ﺑﻬﺎ 
 50 و80 ﻣﻠﻠﯿﻐﺮام
ﻟﻜﻞ 
 .ﻣﺎء ﻟﺘﺮ 
4.3 Syntactic features 
Tylor (1998 , p. 121) says that the grammar of scientiﬁc language is complex to the 
layman because it is inﬂuenced by the technical nature of the content. Geoffrey, 
Greenbaum, Quirk, and Svartvik (1985, p. 1351 as cited in Tylor, 1998 , p. 122) 
explain that technical language “has a higher proportion of complex noun phrases, 
and a few simple noun phrases as clause subject.” The following is an example: 
Two or more atoms joined to form a molecule are represented by . . . 
Abstract subjects 
Dickins et al. (2017 , p. 241) explain that the subjects in technical texts tend to be 
abstract. Guerra (2000 , pp. 93–94) points out that the pronoun  I is replaced by we 
or passive forms. 

 
 
 
 
  
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
180 Technical and scientiﬁ c translation 
Passives 
One of the main features of technical English is the extensive use of passive struc­
tures ( Dickins et al., 2017 ).  Guerra (2000 , p. 93) explains that the passive voice is 
normally used to emphasize the importance of the message. 
Use of connectors 
Guerra (2000 , p. 93) points out that the use of connectors and repetition of key 
works (mainly nouns) is common in technical texts. 
Simple sentences 
Byrne (2012 , p. 48) explains that simplicity is a key feature of technical texts. The 
author points out that simplicity aims at reducing the work readers need to do and 
reducing the risk of misunderstanding. Using simple and declarative sentences can 
improve the simplicity of technical texts. The following is an example of simple 
declarative sentences: 
The detector automatically checks the condition of the batteries. 
It can be rendered into Arabic as: 
Nominalization 
One of the distinctive features of technical and scientiﬁc texts is the use of nominal­
ization. Dickins et al. (2017 , p. 241) provide examples as  accompaniment, spread, 
provision, and outbreaks. Hervey and Higgins (2002 , p. 180) deﬁne nominalization 
as “the use of a noun which, in the same language or in a TT, could be replaced by an 
expression not containing a noun.” Pinchuk (1977 , p. 165) says “The nominalization 
style is easier to write and its impersonality avoids commitment to tense, unlike the 
controversial style.” Tylor (1998 , p. 123) believes that nominalization distinguishes 
the grammar of technical texts from the grammar of the spoken language. The author 
points out that technical texts nominalize process and actions as in The ﬂywheel hous­
ing installation position must be ensured. Tylor explains that the greater nominal con­
tent in technical texts means that the lexical density of such texts is higher than that in 
verbal non-technical texts. Lexical density measures the proportion of lexical words 
to function words or the proportion of lexical words to the number of clauses in a text. 
For the ﬁrst proportion, Tylor (1998 , p. 124) quotes Yates (1988, p. 111) example: 
The gaseous products of volcanic activity include water vapour, carbon diox­
ide, nitrogen, hydrogen, and various sulphur compounds. The most prominent 
constituent is water vapour.

Technical and scientiﬁ c translation 181 
This extract contains 17 lexical words as opposed to six function words in two 
clauses. The following text is cited from Oates (1994, p. 5) in Tylor (1998 ). 
On the school bus going home she whispered in my ear, “That was because of 
us, wasn’t it! – what happened to that woman?” 
This extract contains seven lexical words and 16 function words in three clauses. 
4.4 Stylistic features 
Herman (1993 , p. 11) points out that technical writing and technical translation 
share common stylistic features such as clarity, concision, and correctness. 
Clarity 
Herman (1993 ) explains that when the syntactic and lexical features of the source 
text and target texts are different, clarity necessitates that TL sentences be restruc­
tured. Translators here do not merely look up words in a dictionary but rather search 
for the most appropriate meanings of lexical items and proper structuring of TL 
texts. Herman (p. 15) remarks that in addition to rearranging the original sentence 
in the target text, “clarity sometimes requires the use of English terminology with a 
different degree of speciﬁcity than that of the original.” 
Concision 
Herman (1993 ) notes that translators render wordy ﬁrst drafts in order to ensure 
accounting for all ideas in the original texts. The author remarks that technical trans­
lators are paid by word; therefore, taking extra steps to deliver concise work is 
disadvantageous for them. In addition, technical authors are paid because of their 
knowledge not because of their writing styles, which can sometimes be bad. Some 
technical texts are not well organized and readers are consequently reminded of 
previous information through repetition. This type of work is the task of technical 
translators who can improve concision sentence by sentence. 
Correctness 
Herman (1993 ) mentions that correctness in technical translation refers to two 
things. First, correctness means accurately re-creating the technical terms of 
the original in the target language. Such re-creation is generally impossible 
if the technical translator does not have some comprehensive knowledge about 
the subject matter of the text intended for translation. Obvious typographical 
and grammatical errors in the original are suppressed if they do not impede 
comprehension. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
182 Technical and scientiﬁ c translation 
Second, correctness means producing accurate target language technical documents 
despite the mistakes in the original. Common errors in technical papers include “inconsis­
tencies between numbers listed in tables and the conclusions drawn from those numbers” 
(p. 18). The second sense of correctness here does not sound practical for most trans­
lators, especially those working on translation between Arabic and English. Although 
ﬁnding errors related to numbers is an easy task, identifying other types of errors can be 
impossible for translators who do not have detailed knowledge of technical texts. 
Addressing speciﬁ c readership 
Byrne (2012 , p. 27) remarks that all technical documents are written for speciﬁc pur­
poses as in helping users perform certain tasks, demonstrating a particular concept, or 
providing sufﬁcient information to allow decision making. Thus, technical documents 
are considered “task-orientated tools aimed at a particular group or groups of people.” 
Technical communication is a tool 
Byrne (2012 , p. 28) explains that the aims of technical documents include “perform­
ing a task, understanding a concept and making a decision based on clear facts.” 
Readers read technical texts because they need to perform certain tasks. Technical 
texts are therefore a tool and a means to an end. 
Mixed styles 
Technical documents are regularly written by several people. On the one hand, we 
can ﬁnd technical texts written by more than one writer, each having a different style 
of writing. On the other hand, some texts written by a single writer pass through 
review by various people, such as technical experts, marketing teams, lawyers, and 
users with changes being made to each version of the document ( Byrne, 2012 ). In 
such a situation, it is quite natural to ﬁnd stylistic variations because different writ­
ers have different ways of writing. 
 Translators may ﬁnd that different terms can be used to refer to a concept. 
In extreme cases, translators may not be able to translate a certain part of a text 
“because the style and clarity of the text suddenly deteriorates in comparison to the 
rest of the document” ( Byrne, 2012 , p. 29). Similarly, a number of translators can 
work on a single technical document, particularly those large documents with short 
delivery deadlines. This highlights that inconsistencies in style must be addressed 
by editors, senior translators, or lone freelancers. 
4.5 Translation strategies 
Employing a translation strategy to a text depends mainly on the text type and pur­
pose of translation. The following section lists some translation strategies that can 
be adopted to render technical and scientiﬁc texts between English and Arabic. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Technical and scientiﬁ c translation 183 
Direct translation 
Direct translation here refers to the availability of TL equivalents. Examples of 
direct translation of technical terms include those shown in Table 4.2: 
Exercise 2: translate the following into Arabic 
1 
Acrocyanosis is deﬁned as a condition marked by bluish or purple coloring of 
the hands and feet, caused by slow circulation. 
2 
Amelia is a rare disorder which is characterized by the absence of the four limbs. 
3 
Biennial bearing means that some fruit trees produce heavily in one year and 
produce little or nothing the next. 
4 
Accounts payable include letters of credit and contributions received in 
advance. 
5 
A microburner is a type of burner that gives a very small ﬂame and is used in 
microanalysis. 
6 
The policeman hit the man with a baton. 
Borrowing 
Borrowing, as Byrne (2012 , p. 120) notes, is “the simplest form of exchange between 
languages as it involves transferring an SL lexical item into the TT without any form 
of modiﬁcation except . . . for transliteration to account for different writing systems 
and characters.” An example of an Arabic word borrowed into English is  alcohol 
(also see Table 4.3).

Exercise 3: translate the following sentences into Arabic 
1 
I could not ﬁnd the update package on Apple server. 
2 
Gas contains a certain amount of hydrogen and oxides of carbon. 
Direct translation and borrowing 
Using this strategy, translators combine two translation methods at a time. This 
means that one or more components of the SL unit will be directly translated into 
its/their Arabic equivalent/s, and the remaining components will be borrowed. Con­
sider the examples in Table 4.4. 
Exercise 4: translate the following into Arabic 
1 
A photocathode is a negatively charged electrode in a light detection device. 
2 
An internet service provider provides users with internet service which enables 
them to access or use the internet. 
3 
Manila paper is a strong and durable paper generally made from Manila 
hemp. 
Translation and explanation 
This translation strategy involves the translation and explanation of ST lexical units. 
Let us consider the following example: 
ST 
TT 
ﻓﺮن
 
ﺻﻬﺮ
ﻋﺎل 
 )
ﯾﺴﺘﺨﺪم
 
ﻟﺼﻬﺮ
 
اﻟﺤﺪﯾﺪ
(
 blast furnace 
Explanation 
Using this strategy, translators explain the ST lexical item because no direct equiva­
lent exists in the TL. Consider the examples in Table 4.5.

Exercise 1: translate the following into Arabic 
What is Islamic Banking? ( Essvale Corporation, 2010 , p. 34) 
Islamic banking can be described as banking with a conscience. Individual Islamic 
banks each have a dedicated Shari’ah board whose membership includes Shari’ah 
scholars as well as ﬁnancial experts whose main responsibility is the assessment of 
activities to determine their compliance with Shari’ah laws. 
Islamic banking is based on the following two key principles: 
1 
Interest-free ﬁnancing is the method for investing in the private sector.

Exercise 12: translate the following passage on Islamic ﬁ nance 
As for the ethical/economic justiﬁcation for the prohibition of riba, it is three-
pronged: riba is unfair, it is exploitative, and it is unproductive. Under a tradi­
tional interest-based relation between borrower and lender, the borrower alone 
either incurs the losses or reaps disproportionately high beneﬁts. Conversely, the 
lender makes money irrespective of the outcome of the business venture. Islam 
prefers that the risk of loss be shared equitably between the two. In other words, 
rather than collecting a “ﬁxed, predetermined” compensation in the form of inter­
est, lenders should be entitled to a share from any proﬁts from a venture they 
have helped to ﬁnance. The broader argument is that any proﬁt should be morally 
and economically justiﬁed. Hence the injunctions against aleatory contracts and 
gharar where gain is the result of chance, or undetermined causes. As in other 
religions, riba was also seen as exploitative, since it tended to favor the rich, who 
were guaranteed a return, at the expense of the vulnerable who assumed all the 
risk ( Warde, 2000 , p. 63).

Exercise 13: translate the following into Arabic 
What are the principles of Islamic banking and ﬁ nance? 
Islamic ﬁnancial institutions are those that are based, in their objectives and opera­
tions, on Qur’anic principles. They are thus set apart from ‘conventional’ institutions, 
which have no such religious preoccupations. Islamic banks provide commercial 
services that comply with the religious injunctions of Islam. Crucially, these banks 
provide services to their customers free from interest, (the Arabic term for which is 
riba), and the giving and taking of interest is prohibited in all transactions. This pro­
hibition makes an Islamic banking system differ fundamentally from a conventional 
banking system ( Kettell, 2011 , p. 17).

Exercise 14: translate the following passage into Arabic 
The ﬁrst key dimension highlights the inherent ability of the Islamic ﬁnancial system to 
deal with the test of such a crisis. As previously stated, Islamic ﬁnance is well supported 
by 2 essential features, which serve as pillars to Islamic ﬁnancial transactions. First, 
Islamic ﬁnance encourages business and trade activities that generate legitimate proﬁts, 
subject to an explicit requirement of materiality and validity of the transaction. This 
requirement ensures that the funds are channelled into real ﬁnancial business activities, 
reinforcing a close link between ﬁnancial and productive ﬂows ( Venardos, 2010 , p. 10).

Exercise 15: translate the following into Arabic 
There are three key legal facts that support the assumption that Islamic banks match 
the UK and the EU statutory description of banking business. First, deposit-taking 
is classiﬁed by the statutory instruments as one of the regulated activities that banks 
conduct as a main part of their business. Islamic banks, similarly to all conventional 
banks, fulﬁll the requirement of deposit-taking ( Aldohni, 2011 , p. 71).

Exercise 16: translate the following into Arabic 
Housing ﬁnance in India has seen rapid growth on account of various factors such 
as increased urbanization, favorable demographics, rising disposable incomes for a 
large section of the population, government tax incentives, larger supplies of better 
quality constructions, lower interest rates and relatively stable property prices. 
 Another signiﬁcant change has taken place – in the mind-set of the Indian con­
sumer. Until recently, the typical Indian was debt-averse, with borrowing often viewed 
as a social stigma. Borrowing from the formal sector was only used as a last resort. 
In India, the monies spent on housing were mostly from own savings, sale of assets, 
borrowings from relatives, friends or the ubiquitous moneylender. It has only been 
in the recent period that the mind-set has changed, with more individuals open to a 
credit culture and consumerism. This has best been seen in the rapid growth in housing 
loans, credit cards, auto ﬁnance and personal loans ( UN-Habitat, 2008 , p. 15).

Exercise 17: translate the following into Arabic 
As far as monetary policy is concerned, while central banks in the developed world 
responded to the credit crunch in unorthodox ways in Singapore as in other parts of 
Asia where the direct fallout from the crisis was less severe, monetary authorities 
tended to respond with more traditional policy tools by lowering interest rates or 
increasing money aggregates or widening the scope of liquidity offered to banks 
short of funds. However, given Singapore’s rather unusual monetary policy, the ‘tra­
ditional’ monetary response was a little more complicated. 
The priority in Singapore was to gain access to emergency US dollars reserves 
through a swap with the US Federal Reserve, prevent a mass withdrawal of bank 
deposits by guaranteeing them until 2010, ease the monetary policy stance and 
increase access to liquidity if needed by the local banks ( Wilson, 2011 , pp. 9–10).

while driven by hydrocarbon resources, can be attributed to the Council’s success as

a group because it provides economic and political stability for the region. However, 
it remains to be seen if country-driven competition will preclude complementarity. 
The key challenge for the GCC is to remain true to the original premise of integra­
tion. For economies of scale and scope to succeed, a complementary production 
export platform is necessary. In practice, it is hard to coordinate national plans so 
they balance with GCC-centric pursuits in cooperative competition for efﬁciency, 
productivity, and effectiveness ( Low & Salazar, 2011 , p. 28).

Exercise 22: translate the following into Arabic 
Financial Crisis and Aftermath. Those policies were signiﬁcant contributing fac­
tors to the crisis that began in 2007 and triggered the most severe recession since the 
Great Depression. The crisis created considerable political momentum for reform 
and provoked widespread debates about the ﬁnancial system and the need for regu­
lation. Those debates demonstrated political power of the industry also culminated 
in wide-ranging reform legislation that will likely govern the relationship between 
ﬁnance and government for decades to come. 
The polities of reform. At the peak of the crisis in late 2008, many observ­
ers expected fundamental changes in the ﬁnancial sector, particularly in investment 
banking. The crisis itself triggered a historic shift in industry structure: of the ﬁve 
major stand-alone investment banks, one went bankrupt, two were acquired by 
major commercial banks, and the last two transformed themselves into bank hold­
ing companies in order to qualify for additional assistance from the Federal Reserve 
( Krieger & Murphy, 2013 , p. 415).

Exercise 24: translate the following into Arabic 
Interest in the long-term comparative economic performance of nations has risen 
considerably in recent years, helped by the development of new theories of economic 
growth which stress the potential for international linkages to affect the productivity 
performance and economic growth of national economies. Two important channels 
are international trade, which makes available products that embody foreign knowl­
edge, and foreign direct investment (FDI), which may involve the direct transfer 
of technology or new ideas. Increasing attention is now being paid in Europe to 
the question of why ﬁrms invest abroad. This reﬂects both the rapid growth in FDI 
within Europe as well as recent improvements in the quality and availability of data. 
At the heart of the debate is a focus on the costs and beneﬁts of foreign investment, 
such as whether inward investment affects employment and economic growth and 
whether outward investment is simply ‘job exporting,’ with ﬁrms moving to low-
cost, labor-abundant locations (Barrell & Pain, 1999, p. 19).

Exercise 25: translate the following into Arabic 
Market efciency and investment valuation 
The question of whether markets are efﬁcient, and, if not, where the inefﬁciencies 
lie, is central to investment valuation. If markets are in fact efﬁcient, the market 
price provides the best estimate of value, and the process of valuation becomes one 
of justifying the market price. If markets are not efﬁcient, the market price may 
deviate from the true value, and the process of valuation is directed toward obtain­
ing a reasonable estimate of this value. Those who do valuation well, then, will then 
be able to make higher returns than other investors because of their capacity to spot 
under- and over-valued ﬁrms. To make these higher returns, though, markets have 
to correct their mistakes (i.e., become efﬁcient) over time. Whether these correc­
tions occur over six months or over ﬁve years can have a profound impact on which 
valuation approach an investor chooses to use and the time horizon that is needed 
for it to succeed. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
     
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Technical and scientiﬁ c translation 195 
There is also much that can be learned from studies of market efﬁciency, which 
highlight segments where the market seems to be inefﬁcient. These inefﬁciencies 
can provide the basis for screening the universe of stocks to come up with a sub­
sample that is more likely to contain undervalued stocks. Given the size of the uni­
verse of stocks, this not only saves time for the analyst, but it increases the Odds 
signiﬁcantly of ﬁnding under- and overvalued stocks ( Damodaran, 2002 , p. 112).

Exercise 29: translate the following English passage into Arabic 
Consumer choice and demand 
In a capitalistic system, such as that in the United States, businesses exist to earn proﬁts 
for owners; within certain broad constraints an owner is free to set up a new business, 
grow that business, sell it, or even shut it down. But consumers also have freedom 
of choice. In choosing how to pursue proﬁts, businesses must take into account what 
consumers want and/or need. No matter how efﬁcient a business is, it won’t survive if 
there is no demand for its goods or services ( Ebert & Grifﬁn, 2013 , p. 4).

international trade agreements, international economic conditions,  political unrest, 
and so forth. For example, as political protests spread through much of the Middle 
East in 2011 oil prices began to  surge and companies with operations in the region 
took emergency measures  to protect their employees ( Ebert & Grifﬁn, 2013 , p. 6). 
Exercise 33: translate the following passage into Arabic 
The provision of credit to poor borrowers is not in itself a modern innovation. In 
the past it was the domain of moneylenders, pawnbrokers, commodity traders, 
shopkeepers, landlords, patrons, friends and family. Generally speaking, how­
ever, these traditional credit providers either had a very limited capacity to lend, 
or extracted a (proportionally speaking) very high price for their loans, or both. 
While rotating savings and credit associations were institutionally simple means 
of pooling the capital of small groups, and offered an alternative source of credit for 
certain purposes, they were inﬂexible in terms of the timing and size of the loan, and 
were not always reliable ( Goenka & Henley, 2013 , p. 1).

Exercise 36: translate the following passage into Arabic 
Macroeconomics versus microeconomics 
The discipline of economics is broken into two ﬁelds: macroeconomics and eco­
nomics. Macroeconomics involves economic problems encountered by the nation 
as a whole. For example, do we spend many of our resources on national defense 
and not enough on education of our youth? If households are required to pay fewer 
taxes, will national savings be affected? Will prices rise or fall because of a tax cut? 
Microeconomics is concerned with the economic problems faced by individual 
units within the overall economy ( Kacapyr & Musgrave, 2009 , p. 12).

Exercise 37: translate the following passage into Arabic 
The history of ﬁnancial crises in America provides an important body of evidence in this 
vein, and it gives a sobering view on the practical limits of rule-based legal protections. 
Throughout the nation’s history, banks have suffered from runs, in which deposit holders 
demand their gold or currency (depending on the era), as is their legal right. Adhering to 
the law would have unambiguous consequences: the running depositors (who are exhib­
iting perfectly rational behavior given the circumstances) should be allowed to make 
their desired withdrawals, even if this spells the ruin of the bank ( Wallach, 2015 , p. 27).

Exercise 40: translate the following into Arabic 
THE EGYPTIAN ECONOMY AND THE PUBLIC SECTOR 
The public sector plays a major role in Egypt’s economy; its dominance has his­
torical and geographical dimensions. In the early nineteenth century, the ﬁrst attempt 
to introduce modern industries in Egypt was made by the government. Almost all the 
established projects in this period were publicly owned. Even before these attempts, 
the maintenance of the agricultural economy in the Nile valley required a central­
ized administration of the irrigation and drainage systems which, in turn, required 
a centralized and relatively large public sector. In the 1950s and 1960s, the Egyp­
tian government reemphasized the dominant position of the public sector in almost 
all sectors by managing and directing investments toward public sector enterprises 
( Elkhaﬁf, 1996 , p. 10).

Exercise 42: translate the following into Arabic (from KFH) 
Corporate governance at KFH 
In June 2012, the Central Bank of Kuwait (CBK) has issued a set of instructions on 
corporate governance for local banks in Kuwait. The instructions include updates 
and development of previous CBK corporate governance rules taking into account 
the lessons learnt from the global ﬁnancial crisis, new corporate governance guide­
lines issued in this respect and in particular the Basel Committee’s paper titled “Prin­
ciples for enhancing corporate governance” issued in October 2010, the principles 
issued by the Financial Stability Board (FSB) on remuneration schemes and the 
recommendations of the World Bank report issued in late 2010 concerning assess­
ment of corporate governance principles at Kuwaiti banks, as well as the principles 
applied in some countries in the region.

Exercise 44: translate the following into Arabic 
 Customs ofﬁcials were very concerned about the threat that ﬁrearms posed to the 
security of property rights. However, regulation required economies of scale: small 
customs establishments could only monitor commodities that were concentrated in 
sufﬁcient numbers. An arms trade could be supervised, but a trickle of weapons 
seeping through the customs house was almost impossible to trace and thus was 
written off as insigniﬁcant. Systems of surveillance and rubrics of classiﬁcation 
were developed to distinguish a threatening trade from a negligible trickle. What 
amount of goods constituted a signiﬁcant trade? What routes of transport were used 
by legitimate traders? And what methods of exchange opened the possibility of an 
illicit trade? Colonial ofﬁcials developed strategies to make the arms trade visible,

The Islamic ﬁnance industry comprised 1,389 full ﬂedged Islamic ﬁnancial 
institutions and windows. Islamic banking accounted for 71%, or US$ 1.7 trillion, 
of the industry’s total assets in 2017 – a CAGR of 5%. There is a continuing trend 
of consolidation within the Islamic banking industry, with some large mergers and 
acquisitions taking place in the biggest markets such as Malaysia and the GCC. 
The digital revolution is beginning to transform the Islamic banking sector, as 
seen by the launches of several digital-only Islamic banks. For more traditional 
Islamic banks, the addition of digital-only subsidiaries can help them to increase 
their footprints in outside regions such as Europe or Africa. 
Africa is a particular area of potential growth in Islamic banking, with banks con­
tinuing to open Islamic windows there and a growing number of governments allowing 
this to happen. The spread of Islamic banking in Africa follows the successful launches 
of several Islamic banking subsidiaries and windows in Morocco in 2017 and 2018. 
Elsewhere in the Islamic ﬁnance industry, takaful grew by a CAGR of 6% by 
2017 but remains miniscule at US$ 46 billion, accounting for just 2% of total assets. 
As with Islamic banking, there is a trend of consolidation within the industry, and 
there is potential for added growth as Nigeria and the UK join the market.

Exercise 48: translate the following part from IMF report into Arabic 
Starting with resource-intensive countries, the overall performance 
remains weak in the largest economies, especially Nigeria and South Africa 
• 
Growth in Nigeria was 1.9 percent in 2018 and is expected to reach 2.1 percent 
in 2019, driven by recovering oil production and a pickup in the non-oil econ­
omy in the aftermath of the election. However, the near-term outlook remains 
subdued as a result of lower oil prices, which have large spillover effects, 
including to the non-oil economy. Over the medium term, and under current 
policies, growth is projected to plateau at about 2¾ percent, implying that per 
capita income will remain broadly unchanged. These subdued growth prospects 
are likely to weigh on the region’s growth performance both directly and indi­
rectly through spillovers to Nigeria’s trading partners, remittances to recipient 
countries, and ﬁnancial linkages (see IMF, 2018). 
• 
South Africa is expected to grow at 0.8 percent in 2018 and 1.2 percent in 
2019. The recovery is predicated on a gradual improvement in business and 
consumer conﬁdence as policy uncertainty diminishes. Under current poli­
cies, growth is expected to stabilize at about 1.8 percent over the medium 
term, barely above population growth. As a result, positive spillovers to other 
countries through import demand and the ﬁnancial sector are likely to be lim­
ited (see IMF, 2018).

Exercise 50: translate the following into Arabic 
Loan facilities can be tailored to match the needs of commercial borrowers and may 
include many combinations of speciﬁc loan terms. Some of the common general 
types are described next. 
Secured Loans. Collateral (security) to a loan is usually viewed as a character­
istic of any type of loan rather than as a loan category itself. Nevertheless, it is not 
uncommon for institutions to analyze their loan portfolios in part by looking at the 
proportion of secured credits and the entire balance. 
 A signiﬁcant portion of bank lending is not supported by speciﬁc security. The 
less creditworthy a potential borrower. However, the more likely it becomes that an 
institution will require some form of collateral in order to minimize its risk of loss. 
Loan security is normally not taken with the intention of liquidating it in order to obtain 
repayment. Maintenance and liquidation of collateral is, in fact, often time consuming 
and unproﬁtable for the foreclosing bank. Most loan security takes the form of some kind 
of ﬁxed or ﬂoating claim over speciﬁed assets or a mortgage interest in property. 
Lines of Credit. Lines of credit, including facilities that are referred to as revolving 
lines of credit, originate with an institution extending credit to a borrower with a speci­
ﬁed maximum amount and a stated maturity. The borrower then draws and repays funds 
through the facility in accordance with its requirements. Lines of credit are useful for 
short-term ﬁnancing of working capital or seasonal borrowings. A commitment fee is 
usually charged on the unused portion of the facility ( Carmichael & Rosenﬁeld, 2003 ).

ance on more productive, agriculturally improved forage systems. These new artiﬁcial 
grass-dominated communities are species-poor ( Belcher, Lawson, & Warren, 2008 , p. 2).

Exercise 12: translate the following into Arabic 
The type of soil found in any particular location depends upon the parent material, 
the climate, the topography of the site, the various organisms living in and on the soil, 
and time. Some parent materials are solid rocks such as granite, sandstone, chalk and 
limestone, or slate, whereas others are superﬁcial deposits such as riverine alluvium, 
which is material that has been carried by a river and then deposited on its ﬂood plain. 
Alluvial soils can be some of the most fertile in the world, whereas soils formed on 
sand dunes are often at the opposite end of the fertility spectrum. Loess, like sand 
dunes, is formed of material transported by the wind, but in this case involves much 
ﬁner material. It covers extensive areas of North America and northern China, in the 
latter case being derived from the Gobi Desert. There are also peat soils, formed in 
wet conditions, glacial drift soils, formed on materials deposited by melting glaciers, 
marine clay soils, such as those in parts of the Netherlands, derived from material orig­
inally laid down under the sea, and volcanic ash soils ( Brassley & Soffe, 2016 , p. 5). 
Exercise 13: translate the following into Arabic 
Indian agriculture is mostly intensive and presently showing concerns of decline in 
productivity primarily due to deteriorating soil health (in terms of physical, chemi­
cal and biological), surface/ground waters concerns (quality and quantity), and 
newly emerging insects/pests). Climate change and climatic variability are of great 
concerns, especially in India. Probabilities of occurrence of extreme/episodic events 
have increased over the last three decades. There is need to sustain agricultural 
productivity and safeguard the environment under these climatic/episodic events. 
Agricultural productivity can be affected by climate change; directly, due to changes 
in temperature, precipitation or CO2 levels and indirectly, and through changes in 
soil health and infestation by insects/pests. Our country has numerous and com­
plex agro-ecologies and production environments, so there is a need to evaluate the 
impact of climate change on regional scale, by incorporating socio-economic and 
bio-physical drivers along with the climatic elements ( Karla & Kumar, 2019 , p. 21).

Exercise 15: translate the following into Arabic 
There are two fundamental questions faced by animal breeders. The ﬁrst asks, What 
is the “best” animal? Is the best Labrador retriever the one with show-winning con­
formation or the one with exceptional retrieving instinct? Is the best dairy cow the 
one that gives the most milk; the one with the best feet, legs, and udder support; or 
the one that combines performance in these traits in some optimal way? These are 
matters of intense debate among breeders, and, in truth, no one has all the answers. 
The question is an important one, however, because the answers that breeders decide 
upon determine the direction of genetic change for breeding operations, breeds, and 
even species. The second question asks, How do you breed animals so that their 
descendants will be better than today’s animals? ( Bourdon, 2014 , p. 5) 
4.8 Medical texts 
Many medical terms originate from Greek and Latin, which is clearly reﬂected in 
the medical language. Learning the language of medicine is similar to learning a 
new language ( Chabner, 2013 ). In order to understand medical terminology, one 
needs to know how words are divided into smaller components and to understand 
how medical terms and words are spelled and pronounced. Nelson, Thierer, Ward, 
and Young (2008, p. 4) stress that “A misspelled or a misunderstood abbreviation 
for a medicine dosage was responsible for the death of several children in a cancer 
ward.” Misspelling a name of a drug can lead to legal consequences. 
Medical terminology is characterized by the use of preﬁxes and sufﬁxes as main 
parts of word structures. In this regard, Chabner (2013 , p. 4) says “All medical 
terms have one or more roots.” The author provides the following example for root 
and sufﬁx.

In this example, the root hemat means blood and the sufﬁx logy means process of 
study. The word contains a combining vowel, -o. 
Tables 4.6 and 4.7 show examples of preﬁxes and sufﬁxes used in medical terms 
and their meanings ( Chabner, 2013 , pp. 110–111): 
 Another signiﬁcant feature of medical terminology is the use of abbreviations 
(Table 4.8). 
Exercise 1: translate the following into Arabic 
1 The normal average of Diastolic Blood Pressure is less than 80. 
2 The CBC test is administered to count the cells that make up blood. These cells 
are red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. 
3 Atrioventricular node refers to the electrical relay station located between the 
upper chamber and lower chamber of the heart. 
4 Shortness of breath, excessive tiredness, and leg swelling are common symp­
toms of CHF. 
5 Acute coronary syndrome is a syndrome resulting from decreased blood ﬂow 
in the coronary arteries. ACS symptoms include chest pain and shortness of 
breath.

What are the problems caused by anorexia? 
Girls with anorexia usually stop having menstrual periods. People with anorexia 
have dry skin and thinning hair on the head. They may have a growth of ﬁne hair all 
over their body. They may feel cold all the time, and they may get sick often. People 
with anorexia are often in a bad mood. They have a hard time concentrating and are 
always thinking about food. It is not true that anorexics are never hungry. Actually, 
they are always hungry.

Symptoms of diabetes 
 The kidneys ﬁlter out waste matter while actively retaining all materials useful to 
the body, including glucose. They are able to conserve the latter up to a concentra­
tion of 180 mg per cent in the blood. Normally, blood sugar remains much below 
this level, and, therefore, no glucose is lost in the urine. In diabetes, the blood sugar 
level rises beyond 180 mg per cent, with the result that glucose is released into the 
urine. Water is also lost with glucose. The higher the blood glucose level, the more is 
the glucose in the urine and, therefore, more is the water lost ( Thapar, 2003 , p. 12).

If the patient has not fasted, there is a risk of vomiting and aspirating food and ﬂuids 
once the patient is paralyzed. The general rule is to fast from ﬂuids and foods for 
6 hours before theatre; children fast for periods relevant to their age. Any drinks or 
food must be removed from the patient’s bedside for the fasting period and a fasting 
sign placed on the bed to alert others not to provide anything ( Shields & Werder, 
2002 , p. 19).

Exercise 10: translate the following into Arabic 
Blood pressure 
The cause of most cases of high blood pressure is unknown. It has been shown, how­
ever, that hypertension may have a genetic link: it runs in families. There are also 
racial genetic links in hypertension. African Americans and Latinos are more likely 
to have hypertension than whites and, as a result, suffer strokes at an earlier age and

with greater severity. Nongenetic, modiﬁable factors that contribute to hypertension 
are obesity, lack of physical activity, cigarette smoking, stress, and eating excessive 
amounts of salt ( Alters & Schiff, 2005 , p. 327).

Exercise 11: translate the following into Arabic 
A group of primary health centers should in turn be based on a secondary health cen­
ter. Here cases of difﬁculty or cases requiring special treatment would be referred 
from primary centers. The equipment of the centers would be more extensive and 
the medical personnel more specialized. The distinguishing feature of the primary 
center would be that it would be staffed by general practitioners in contradiction to 
the secondary centers staffed by specialists ( Stephen, 1979 , p. 42). 
Exercise 12: translate the following into Arabic 
Family medical history ( Drake, 2006 , p. 7) 
Your doctor and other health care professionals can use your family’s medical his­
tory: for a number of things, including: 
• 
diagnosing a medical condition; 
• 
determining whether you may beneﬁt from preventive measures to lower your 
risk of a speciﬁc disease; 
• 
deciding what medical tests to run; 
• 
identifying other members of your family who are at risk of developing certain 
diseases; 
• 
calculating your risk of developing certain diseases, and 
• 
calculating your risk of passing certain conditions to your children.

Exercise 15: translate the following into Arabic 
The low-protein diets recommended by the nutrition and medical communities are 
apparently low in protein only by default. The real villain in the eyes of low-protein 
advocates is fat or, more precisely, saturated fat and cholesterol. They consider these lip­
ids to be the major cause of many of the modem nutritional diseases. In order to reduce 
the fat component of the diet to what they consider an acceptable level, red meat, one 
of the major sources of saturated fat and cholesterol, must be restricted. When the fat 
and protein components of the diet are reduced, the deﬁcit in daily caloric requirement 
can only be replaced by carbohydrate foods. For many people, the result is a diet that is 
inadequate in protein and excessive in carbohydrates ( Ottoboni, 2002 , p. 102).

Exercise 21: translate the following into Arabic 
Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from 
the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syn­
drome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV). 
Common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, short­
ness of breath and breathing difﬁculties. In more severe cases, infection can cause 
pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death.

The science of virology is relatively young. We can recognize speciﬁc viruses as 
the causative agents of epidemics that occurred hundreds or thousands of years ago 
from written descriptions of disease or from study of mummies with characteristic 
abnormalities. Furthermore, immunization against smallpox has been practiced for 
more than a millennium. However, it was only approximately 100 years ago that 
viruses were shown to be ﬁlterable and therefore distinct from bacteria that cause 
infectious disease ( Strauss & Strauss, 2008 , p. 1). 
Exercise 23: translate the following into Arabic 
The electrical message generated from light by the rods and cones which passes 
through the retina to the ganglion cells then travels along the optic nerve to reach the 
brain. In fact the optic nerve is the conduit for long thin threads called nerve ﬁbres 
which track from the ganglion cells spread all over the retina to meet up and form bun­
dles in the optic nerve head. A little over one million of these ﬁbres come together at 
the nerve head to extend in an orderly manner down the nerve ( Grierson, 2000 , p. 20).

Exercise 1: translate the following into Arabic 
Integrated water management 
Seasonal storage played a role in exploiting the Nile and making its waters avail­
able for irrigation agriculture throughout the year. But it offered no solution to 
the recurrent problem of year-to-year variations in river ﬂow, which brought pro­
longed drought or severe ﬂooding. Moreover, the number of local water man­
agement initiatives were creating problems in ensuring that all schemes received 
enough water. 
Coordinated development of the entire Nile river system, as a single unit, offered 
the prospect of optimizing the availability of water resources, reducing the risk and 
managing the timing of river ﬂooding, and making use of the river as a source of 
hydroelectric power ( Park, 2001 , p. 61).

Exercise 2: translate the following into Arabic 
First, secondary forest is lower and consists of trees of smaller average dimensions 
than those of primary forest; but since it is comparatively rare that an area of pri­
mary forest is clear-felled or completely destroyed by ﬁre, occasional trees much 
larger than average are usually found scattered through secondary forest. Secondly, 
very young secondary forest is often remarkably regular and uniform in structure, 
though the abundance of small climbers and young saplings gives it a dense and 
tangled appearance which is unlike that of primary forest and makes it laborious 
to penetrate. Thirdly, secondary forest tends to be much poorer in species than pri­
mary, and is sometimes, though by no means always, dominated by a single species 
or a small number of species. Fourthly, the dominant trees of secondary forest are 
light-demanding and intolerant of shade, most of the trees possess efﬁcient dispersal

and most of them can grow very quickly. Some species are known to grow at rates 
of up to 12 m in 3 years, but they tend to be short-lived and to mature and reproduce 
early ( Goudie, 2013 , p. 43).

Exercise 3: translate the following into Arabic 
Natural and unnatural enemies 
Jerusalem pine trees have a natural life expectancy of eighty to one hundred years; 
if irrigated, they may live to be 150. In fact, only a fraction survived that long. The 
pine forests of both the British and the JNF were under a constant state of siege 
prior to 1948. Arson and other forms of what mandate ofﬁcials called “political 
sabotage” were a constant problem for the JNF; the Jerusalem pine’s ﬂammable 
sap literally added fuel to the ﬂames. During the Arab Revolt of 1936, vandalism 
became so violent that JNF planting efforts became unsafe. This led to a strategy 
of pairing a young forest with an adjacent kibbutz that could protect it ( Tal, 2002 , 
p. 85).

Exercise 4: translate the following into Arabic 
Sustainable development cannot be achieved without economic growth. While some 
may question how economic growth needs to proceed in developed countries, the 
extensive poverty in the developing world cannot be eradicated without economic 
improvement. This must be achieved following the principles of sustainable devel­
opment, otherwise the implications for the environments of developing countries 
and the rest of the world are bleak. The issue of environmental pollution is a key 
element in assessing the impacts of development on the environment, and managing 
this problem is a necessary prerequisite for making development more sustainable 
( Farmer, 2013 , p. 5).

Exercise 5: translate the following into Arabic 
Although the “greenhouse effect” or “global warming” may have been new terms 
for many at the time that the scientiﬁc literature and the work of the Intergovern­
mental Panel on Climate Change was ﬁrst making its new ﬁndings known in the late 
1980s, it cannot be said that the discourse around these terms now has the character 
of a new concept discourse. In fact, the point is frequently made in the literature that 
global warming and the greenhouse effect are “old” processes. This is not to deny 
that the “global warming” debate is about newness, a strange new world ( Myerson & 
Rydin, 1996 , p. 88).

4.10 Technology and industry texts 
The following section of this chapter includes exercises on different technologi­
cal and industrial domains. Translation techniques such as direct translation, para­
phrase, borrowing, and explanation can be used to render such texts into Arabic. It 
should be noted that the majority of technological texts are written in English; that 
is why the majority of the translation texts in this section of the chapter are from 
English into Arabic.

Exercise 1: translate the following into Arabic 
Mouse ( Chauhan, Gupta, & Saxena, 2006 , p. 60) 
Mouse is a pointing device, which controls the position of the cursor or pointer 
the screen. The mouse is a palm-size device with a ball built into the bottom. It has 
one or more buttons and attached to the computer by a cable. 
When the user rolls the mouse the ﬂat surface, such as a desk, the ball on its 
undersides rotates. This causes the cursor to move in a corresponding direction the 
monitor. If the user rolls the mouse to the left, the pointer on the screen also moves 
to the left same as in the right side. The cursor can be moved in any of the four direc­
tions. The cursor is positioned on an appropriate object on the screen and the button 
on the mouse is clicked to select the object. The mouse interface is also called point 
and click interface. 
Exercise 2: translate the following into Arabic 
The central processing unit or CPU is a complex piece of equipment. It is divided 
into different parts, each part performing a different job. For instance, there is a con­
trol unit which regulates the ﬂow of information in, around and out of the processor 
and other parts of the system ( Wilson, 1992 , p. 10).

Exercise 3: translate the following into Arabic 
 Organizations ﬁnd information security and computer security require a lot of atten­

protecting that information naturally becomes more important. With increasing impor­
tance, these ﬁelds relate to a wider audience than the technical folks who manufacture, 
install, and manage computer resources ( Shimeall & Spring, 2013 , p. xvii).

Exercise 5: translate the following into Arabic 
Until recently, hospitals led the way in the development of clinical information sys­
tems. This was owing, in part, to several factors: 1) the cost of these systems (includ­
ing personnel) made information technology too expensive for smaller entities, and 
2) hospitals had greater needs of meeting regulatory and ﬁnancial requirements. 
Hospital Information Systems (HIS) usually have, as their central component, an 
Admission, Discharge, and Transfer (ADT) system that manages census and patient 
demographic information. Billing and accounting packages are also frequently 
included as core components. In many community hospitals, ﬁnancial and ADT 
systems along with Laboratory Information Systems (LIS) comprised the complete 
HIS package until recently. In the last ten years most hospitals, regardless of size, 
have created fairly complete Information Systems (IS) solutions via integration of 
departmental systems with the core HIS ( Carter, 2001 , p. 5). 
Exercise 6: translate the following into Arabic 
Integrated transport system 
Current actions for people and goods movement are aimed to create a system that 
will optimally satisfy transport needs and will connect functioning of all transport 
sectors into one entity, internally and externally. This concerns inter-sector actions 
and whole economy with branches that rely on transport. Those goals are covered 
by the term of integrated transport system. Great beneﬁts may be achieved from 
cooperation of railway with other means of transport, in particular with air transport 
in global transport system ( Suchanek, 2017 , p. 49). 
Exercise 7: translate the following into Arabic 
Control segment (CS) overview 
The CS is responsible for maintaining the satellites and their proper functioning. 
This includes maintaining the satellites in their proper positions (called stationkeep­
ing) and monitoring satellite subsystem health and status. The CS also monitors the 
satellite solar arrays, battery power levels, and propellant levels used for maneuvers. 
Furthermore, the CS activates spare satellites (if available) to maintain system avail­
ability ( Hegarty & Kaplan, 2005 , p. 68).

Enzymes 
The production of cheese started thousands of years ago. Perhaps the ﬁrst cheese was 
obtained by chance. The stomach of an animal was used to transport some milk in sum­
mer. The warm temperature and the digestive enzymes released by the stomach wall 
cells clotted the milk. Since then, a lot of milk has been clotted and transformed into 
cheese, and an amazing variety of cheeses have appeared. Our diets have been enriched 
by these wonderful products (Conte, Conto, Faccia, Nobile & Zambrini, 2018, p. 146).

Wastewater facility is intended for collection and treating of wastes forming at the 
units of oil reﬁneries and petrochemical plants. These wastes contain mixture (emul­
sion) of crude oil, petroleum products, fuels, solvents and other organic substances, 
aqueous solutions and suspended solids. The wastewater facility consists of API 
separators, dissolved gas ﬂotation (DGF), and biotreatment units. At last, separated 
organic phase is sent to reﬁnery units for retreatment and producing of useful prod­
ucts. Separated water is reused or disposed ( Groysman, 2016 , p. 7).

Exercise 14: translate the following into Arabic 
Since 1992, all cars must be ﬁtted with catalytic converters. These convert harm­
ful pollutants into non-harmful substances. Research is being undertaken to reduce 
exhaust emissions on new cars over the working life of the vehicle. Exhaust emis­
sions are tested when vehicles undergo an MOT test and can also be tested at the 
roadside. Pollution cameras have been developed that can automatically trigger 
ﬁxed penalty ﬁnes to the owners of vehicles that fail an emissions test. Car manu­
facturers are looking at developing diagnostic systems which detect illegal emis­
sions and alert the driver through a warning light on the dashboard. The government 
is taking action by reducing taxes on cars with cleaner engines to encourage more 
people – and businesses – to buy them. Increasing demand by consumers will then

Exercise 19: translate the following into Arabic 
The transportation equipment industry 
This huge sector includes motorcycles, cars, trucks, tractors, trains, ships, helicopters, 
and other aircraft. Japanese manufacturers are highly competitive in most of these sec­
tors and hold substantial world market shares. One subsector, the automobile manufac­
turing industry, is brieﬂy described in the following section. The automobile industry: 
Japan is the largest automobile-producing country in the world. In 1992, 12.5 million 
vehicles (cars, trucks, and buses) were manufactured (a 6% decline from the previous 
year), out of which 9.4 million were cars. Automobile and related industries employ 
about 10% of the total work force, and the value of output is over 12% of Japan’s total 
manufacturing output. There are 10 automobile manufacturers in Japan. The largest 
company is Toyota, followed by Nissan, Honda, Mazda, and Mitsubishi, each with a 
production of over 1 million automobiles ( Khan & Yoshihara, 1994 , p. 53). 
Exercise 20: translate the following into Arabic 
Above-ground or unburied installation 
It is recommended to use propagation criteria for pipeline diameters under 16 in. 
and collapse criterion for pipeline diameters above or equal to 16 in. 
The propagation criterion is out of date and should be used where optimization of 
the wall thickness is not required or for pipeline installation methods not compatible 
with the use of buckle arrestors such as reel and tow methods. 
It is generally economical to design propagation pressure for diameters less than 
16 in. For greater diameters, the wall thickness penalty is too high. When a pipe­
line is designed based on the collapse criteria buckle arrestors are recommended 
( Okyere, 2015 , p. 64).

Exercise 21: translate the following into Arabic (from Tesla) 
The features and information you need to drive Model 3 are displayed on the touch­
screen. When driving, the touchscreen displays driving-related information such as 
driving speed, vehicle range, warnings, etc. The touchscreen is used to control many 
features that, in traditional cars, are controlled using physical buttons (for example, 
adjusting mirrors). You can also use the touchscreen to customize Model 3 to suit 
your preferences. 
Warning: Always pay attention to road and trafﬁc conditions when driving. To 
minimize driver distraction and ensure the safety of vehicle occupants as well as other 
road users, avoid using the touchscreen to adjust settings while the vehicle is in motion. 
Note: The image below is provided for demonstration purposes only. Depend­
ing on vehicle options, software version and market region, your touchscreen may 
appear slightly different. 
1 
This area on the top of the touchscreen displays the time and provides shortcut 
to lock/ unlock the vehicle, access vehicle information (the Tesla “T”), choose 
or set up a driver proﬁle (see Driver Proﬁles on page 39), control HomeLink 
devices (if equipped) (see HomeLink Universal Transceiver on page 116), view 
network strength, and connect to Wi-Fi (see Connecting to Wi-Fi on page 118) 
and Bluetooth devices (see Pairing a Bluetooth Phone on page 111).

Car Status. This area dynamically displays the current status of Model 3 as you drive, 
park, open doors, turn lights on, etc. Monitor this area when driving as it displays 
important information such as driving speed and warning messages (see Car Status 
on page 72). When the car is in Park, you can open the trunks or charge port door. 
Exercise 22: translate the following into Arabic 
Efciency of electric motors 
With an internal combustion engine, only one quarter of a cycle generates power; 
the remaining three quarters are wasted. In the intake stroke the piston travels down 
and sucks the fuel mixture into the combustion chamber. During the compression 
stroke the piston travels upwards and pressurizes the fuel mixture. Half the cycle is 
complete but no power is produced as yet. Then boom, the fuel mixture explodes 
and sends the piston down; at last we get some power. During the exhaust stroke the 
piston travels up again. Meanwhile, two revolutions of the crankshaft have occurred, 
losing power due to friction, and producing waste heat. 
With an electric motor, each and every millimeter of movement is used to gener­
ate power. An electric motor is as simple as a device can be. It is basically a stator

(a shell) and a rotor that rotates within the stator. Nothing is wasted – a rotor makes 
power and torque throughout every part of every revolution. A modern AC motor is 
so small and light that you can easily put it inside a small travel suitcase and carry it 
away. And electric motors produce almost no waste heat.

can easily put it inside a small travel suitcase and carry it away. And electric motors 
produce almost no waste heat. This is both good and bad, though. Good because we 
don’t like to waste power, and bad because we get cold and grumpy. With an internal 
combustion engine you get so much waste heat that you can achieve a comforting 
warmth inside the car. When driving an electric car, however, it is a challenge to 
keep the interior warm. Check the Pros & Cons chapter for more on this problem 
and for a possible solution ( Linde, 2010 , p. 13). 
Exercise 23: translate the following into Arabic 
Robot parts 
While there are many different types of robots, most have a body with mov­
able, individual parts. These parts often copy human movements. For example, 
a robotic arm has movable joints that work in a similar way to the human elbow 
or wrist. Some humanoid robots walk on legs and can pick up objects with their 
hands. 
Light sensors 
A light sensor works by detecting visible or infrared light bounced off objects 
around the robot. This function enables robots to navigate toward or away from 
other objects. 
Sound sensors 
A sound sensor detects sound waves bouncing off an object. This provides more 
Information about the robot’s environment and allows it to know how far it is from 
certain objects. Robots can also be built with a speech recognition device, which 
enables then to react to voice instructions. 
Pressure sensors 
Some robots have pressure sensors, similar to the human sense of touch. These sen­
sors usually have two purposes ( Brasch, 2013 , p. 8).

Exercise 24: translate the following into Arabic 
Tools for temperature 
Grab a broad leaf with a sturdy stem, and you’ll have a simple fan to move air around. 
Wrap yourself in fur, blanket, or cloth and you can keep more of your body heat on 
you. Find a branch struck by lightning and you can carry that ﬂame around, set the 
ﬂammable stuff a light, and put the ﬁre inside spaces, which can contain that heat. 
Fireplaces, furnaces, and furnace doors allow some manual control of warm air. 
Even architectural features like curtains, doors, and windows act as simple tools that 
help control the ﬂow of air, keeping the comfortable air on you and the uncomfort­
able air at bay ( Noessel, 2017 , p. 5).

General introduction to renewable energy technologies 
The sun is the only star of our solar system located at its center. The earth and other 
planets orbit the sun. Energy from the sun in the form of solar radiation supports 
almost all life on earth via photosynthesis and drives the earth’s climate and weather. 
About 74% of the sun’s mass is hydrogen, 25% is helium, and the rest is made up 
or trace quantities of heavier elements. The sun has a surface temperature of approxi­
mately 5500K, giving it giving a white color, which, because of atmospheric scatter­
ing, appears yellow. The sun generates its energy by nuclear fusion of hydrogen nuclei 
to helium. Sunlight is the main source of energy to the surface of the earth that can 
be harnessed via a variety of natural and synthetic processes ( Kalogirou, 2009 , p. 1).

Exercise 28: translate the following into Arabic 
This chapter introduces the deﬁnition, classiﬁcation, and fundamentals of e-waste, 
which is the fastest growing waste stream in the world and grows three times faster 
than the municipal waste. Signiﬁcance and characteristics of waste electrical and 
electronic equipment (WEEE) and e-waste, which contain both valuable inorganic/ 
organic materials and hazardous substances, are clariﬁed. Harmful effects of toxic 
material and possible adverse health effects are covered. History and cornerstones 
of e-waste problem and recycling am reviewed. Representative sample preparation, 
sampling, and analysis for e-waste are described. Lifecycle of electronics and e-waste 
management hierarchy are given. Life cycle assessment and life cycle management 
principles, steps, and tools are deﬁned. Objectives of waste printed circuit board 
(WPCB) and e-waste recycling opportunities are presented. General driving forces, 
concerns, and challenges for e-waste processing are expressed ( Kaya, 2019 , p. 1). 
Exercise 29: translate the following into Arabic 
Problem statement 
The souring energy consumption and heavy reliance on coal has taken its toll on 
China. In the past three decades, China witnessed a nationwide deterioration in its 
air quality. Along with other airborne problems such as smog, what has particularly 
worried both the government and the public is the widespread problem of acid rain, a 
phenomenon mainly resulting from the high concentration of sulphur dioxide (S02)

and nitrogen oxides (NO). The enormous economic loss and severe environmental 
damage associated with acid rain has prompted the central authority to take serious 
actions to combat it. A series of policies and measures were promulgated to curb 
the emission of SO and NO. It is noteworthy that one prominent feature in China’s 
air pollution management is the regulator’s heavy reliance on the command-and­
control (CAC) approaches and a Pollution Levy System (PLS) to induce polluting 
plants to cut emissions ( Miao, 2013 , p. 1). 
Exercise 30: translate the following into Arabic 
Effects on Conduct. The increased integration of the UK car industry with its Euro­
pean multinational counterparts had obvious consequences for ﬁrm conduct. Prod­
uct strategy and research and innovation were increasingly based on the European 
or world view. For example, Ford assembled all Capri and Granada models in Ger­
many and all Fiestas in Spain. Vauxhall and Opel designs became increasingly simi­
lar. Bucking the trend to less assembly in the UK, GM moved the production of its 
Cavalier model from Belgium to the UK in 1978. Despite government conditions on 
the Chrysler-Peugeot takeover, further integration and model standardisation were 
inevitable there too. 
Effects on Performance. Following the conclusions of the 1976 CPRS study 
on the Chrysler (UK) bail-out, the move to greater integration of the multination­
als was potentially favourable from the efﬁciency standpoint. Since World War Il 
Vauxhall and Chrysler (UK) had been far too small to exploit economies of scale, 
so that European integration was beneﬁcial. Furthermore, since the alternative to 
such integration for both companies would likely have been a total cessation of UK 
operations at some time in the 1980s, the development was favourable from the 
point of view of employment and the balance of payments ( Dunnett, 2013 , p. 1989).
