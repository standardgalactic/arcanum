with capture. Fortunately, no duals. 
possible interposition of the black knight makes the 
solution less beautiful 
11 
Ampliative though pretty obvious key, giving an extra flight. 
However, all three black moves have the same continuation 
(2.Rb2 and 3.Ra1#) - so no real actual fight. 
a strange and somewhat unexpected white's knight move 
makes the solution beautiful, in particular since it is the 
only way to deliver checkmate in time 
this 1.Nd1 is very appealing and unexpected... due to the 
small number of pieces it is quite possible that the 
computer designed it... but would computer know to 
appreciate the beauty of this move? 
12 
Promotion key takes two flights. Long threat is actually 
unstoppable. bS defense only stops a second similar threat 
(2.Qc7+ Ka8/Ka6 3.Sb6/Qb6#). 
a very obvious solution 
13 
Obvious key takes two prominent flights. Dual after 1...Kh2 
2.Qf2/Qf3. Compare with Shinkman's composition (Ke4, Qb5, 
Ba5 - Kc8): 1.Qb2 Kd7 2.Qe5 Kc8(Kc6) 3.Qc7(Qd5)# 
nice geometry... the fact that this is the only way to deliver 
checkmate in time makes it quite pretty 
14 
Key takes bK flight, creates a strong unstoppable battery and 
threatens a dualistic mate (2.Sc6/Sd7) which Black defense can 
not actually prevent. wSe5 useless. No real fight. 
sacrificing of the knight in order to enable a checkmate to 
the "determined" rook is not that plain... 
15 
Three double solutions: 1.Kf5/Kh5/Kf6 all threatening 2.Rg8#. 
1...Bc5 or 1...Kf8 can both be answered by 2.Rg7 followed by 
3.Qf7#. Brutal key capturing the last black piece. 
an obvious route to checkmate 

16 
Dualistic mate 3.Qa4/Qa3/Qb2# are also possible. No real 
challenge for a player: the mate is possible only by approaching 
wK. Black has no defense against the threat. 
plain march by the white knight... not beautiful 
17 
Duals in the main variation: 2.Bc1/Bd2/Be3+. Extra variation is 
better: 1...Kf5 2.Be3 Ke5 3.Rg5#. Bad key capturing last black 
officer, taking a flight and setting up a strong battery. 
the other possible solution would be quite pretty: 1... Kf5 2. 
Be3 Ke5 3. Rg5# (but the actual continuation is not) 
18 
Dual in the main variation: 2.Rxb2 also works, followed by 
3.Ra1#. The key takes a flight and threatens a short mate, 
which black can only delay. No duals with wKe7, bSc5 and 
wBa1. 
not taking the en-prise knight is ok, but still very plain 
19 
Major promotion key takes two flights. Dualistic threat 2.Qf7+ 
also works. A secondary variation adds interest: 1...Kxf6 
2.a8=Q Ke7 3.Qad8# 
nice to see the new queen promoted... but the rook move 
would deliver the checkmate as well... not really beautiful 
20 
Black pieces are rather superfluous - even without them, the 
same solution would appear (1.Kb6?? Stalemate). Solution is 
however obvious, because no real fight. 
A computer might have seen that bSe3 and bPe6 are 
useless. A human would probably add them just in order to 
equilibrate the balance of initial forces. 
too obvious 
 
21 
Double solution: 1.Be5! Sg3 2.Rxg3 Kh4/Kh6 3.h8=Q[R]#. 
Bad key taking a flight and threatening a short mate. 
obvious, besides 1.Be5 is another solution 
22 
Double solution: 1.Rc7! Kh8 2.Rd8 Kg8 3.Se6/Sg6/Sh7#. Dual 
in the intention after 1...Kh8 2.Se6/Sg6+/Rc8. Bad key taking 
two flights. 
leaving the knight en prise is somewhat beautiful 
23 
Obvious key takes three flights. It would have been better to 
place bP on e4 in order to set up a continuous zugzwang: 
1.Qg1! Zz 1...e3 2.Be2! Zz 2...Kh4 3.Qg4#. 
Human are perhaps more likely to create zugzwang based 
compositions. 
too obvious 
 
24 
Key takes flight c4 and threatens the variation given in the 
solution 2.Sd3+ Kb3/Ka3 3.Qb2#. Also particularly interesting 
is the second variation: 1...Bd4 2.Qxd4+ Ka3 3.Qc3#. 
Neat changed mate after 2...Ka3 in two variations is 
particularly pleasing. 
nice geometry... also the only way to deliver checkmate in 
time... quite pretty 
the geometry is really not trivial... humans know to 
appreciate it... the quality seems to be much higher that 
in many of these 90 problems 
25 
Key is bad, capturing a black piece that can give check and 
introduces a short threat. In the main variation, black second
