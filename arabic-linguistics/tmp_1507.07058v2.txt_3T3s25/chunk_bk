makes me believe that it is very likely that a human 
composed this one
72 
En prise officer takes the remaining black piece, which was 
almost promoting and threatening to capture another white 
officer. The rest is forced, with interesting pawn mate. 
pretty... it's a pity that the pawn must be taken! 
73 
Typical ending for normal game: flight taking key, followed by 
a flight taking second move with unavoidable mate. Lone bK 
obvious 

hunting. 
74 
Key takes three flights. Black is in zugzwang and white plays 
2.Rg2 and 3.Qe2# regardless black's moves. Nothing really 
exciting. 
not so trivial... but also not very beautiful 
75 
Duals 2.Qd3+/Qe4+/Qf5. Flight taking key guarding also key 
squares a6 and d3. 
this one is nice... not easy, unique solution, geometry 
with these pieces there are many possible checkmates, 
but this one is quite appealing... and that makes it more 
likely in my opinion that a human composed it 
76 
Key takes bR threatening wQ. Neat mate in the main variation, 
similar with 1...Kc4. Dual after 1...Kb4 2.Kb2/Kc2 Kc4 
3.Ra4#. Black Rook could be replaced by black S/B. 
For the appealing diagonal mate (like 62). Another 
appealing setting would be Kc1 Qc2 Bc5 - Kc3.
Obvious 
 
77 
Key takes bR threatening wR and also three flights. Similar 
second variation: 1...Kf2 2.Rb3 Kf1 3.Rf3#. Black Rook could 
be removed when wRe6 is shifted initially on b6. 
Mirror ideal echo mates - long time humans considered 
them a symbol of perfection. Nowadays, however, strategic 
school prevails. 
most straightforward 
 
78 
Horror: two promoted black Bishops can't do anything against 
the threat. Key takes three flights. No real fight. 
white diagonals vs. black colored bishops... quite pretty 
79 
Double solutions: 1.d8=R! f1=Q+ 2.Bxf1 Ka4 3.Ra8# and 
1.Bf1! Ka4 2.d8=Q[R] Ka3 3.Q[R]a8#. Dual in the intention: 
3.Qa8#. The key threatens two short mates. No real fight from 
Black. 
promoting to queen is obvious 
80 
Duals in the main variation 3.Sb2/Se3# and 2.Qb2+/Sa3/Ke2. 
Major promotion threatens short mate and takes flight. 
straightforward 
81 
Typical endgame mate. Key takes flight and threatened mate 
can't be avoided. With similar material better composition were 
shown (Ke7 Ba1 Sh6 - Kh8 pg7 h7 B: Rotate table 180). 
A typical position to be shown by humans, especially when 
explaining the finale KBS vs K. 
just in time mate... unique solution (actually, also the only 
one that wins)... quite nice 
so efficiently pretty... the knight must go to a square 
previously occupied by the king, which makes the 
solution a bit harder to find... that may have been one 
idea of the (human) composer 
82 
Double solution: 1.Qb3! Dual in intention 2.Qf3 Kh2 3.Qg2# 
plenty of solutions, and this geometric one is certainly not 
the ugliest 
83 
Key takes flight g8 and threatens short mate. No black defense 
can change anything, except 1...Ra1 2.Rxa1 and 3.Rh1#. Mate 
on the file is often met. 
obvious 
84 
Key takes two flights and threatens short mate. Other 
variations: 1...Re3 2.Rf7 and 1...Rd7 2.Bxd7/exd7. 
not most obvious... not too pretty either 
85 
Key takes flight g3 and threatens short mate on the file. Other 
variation: 1...Bg8 2.Rxg8. 
straightforward 
86 
Key takes flight thanks to major promotion. Short mates if 
black plays other moves. Dual after 2...Kd6 3.Qc6/Qd8# 
promoting to queen on the first move is generally not the 
prettiest way... also, white has quite a lot of pieces... 
87 
Double solutions: 1.Rxf7! ~ 2.Rg8 ~ 3.Rh7#; 1.Rd2! ~ 2.Re1 ~ 
3.Sf3/Sh3# and 1.Re2! ~ 2.Rd1 ~ 3.Sf3/Sh3#. Duals in 
intention: 2.Rd3/Rd4 ~ 3.Rh3/Rh4#. Bad key taking a flight. 
not capturing the pawn would be somewhat prettier... the 
solution is very obvious 
88 
Key takes flight, with wB leaving from en prise position. The 
long threat is actually unavoidable. However the line opening 
for wBe8 is neat.
