So it would seem that, based on the available evidence, TG1500p does indeed, on average, produce 
compositions that are slightly better in quality than Comp3.5 alone; and that TG2500p is indeed the worst of the 
three in terms of average composition quality. This suggests that real (i.e. actual) photographic information, 
used in conjunction with a low quality chess source (TG1500) via the DSNS approach is able to produce 
creative objects in the domain of chess of comparable quality or even slightly better than using a high quality 
chess source alone (Comp3.5). Again, the reason for this remains an open question for now. 
 
4.7 
The Fifth Experiment: Comparing TG1500p and Comp3.5 Overall Performance 
 
To be sure, an experiment was performed to gauge the overall performance differences between the TG1500p 
and Comp3.5 approaches. This time, three different computers were used, i.e. PC1 and PC2 (see section 4.3) 
and PC3, a notebook: Intel(R) Core(TM) i3 CPU M 370 @ 2.40 GHz with 4 GB of RAM running Microsoft 
Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit. Each computer had different processing power and capabilities; in general, 
in reducing amount from PC1 to PC3. CHESTHETICA was set to run for 24 cycles of automatic composition 
on each computer, comparing these two approaches. Each cycle was set for 6 hours and the composing 
efficiency in compositions per hour (cph) was measured per cycle. The composing process was this time tested 
using two convention filters (i.e. no checks in key move and no captures in key move) and also using no 
convention filters; the former was expected to produce compositions of higher quality but at reduced efficiency. 
 
Compiling the composing efficiency readings from all 72 cycles, we found that the average cph using two 
convention filters based on the TG1500p approach (i.e. 3.32 cph) was indeed higher than the Comp3.5 approach 
(i.e. 2.34 cph) to a statistically significant degree based on a TTUV test : t(108) = -4.406, P < 0.0001. However, 
using no convention filters the TG1500p approach (i.e. 8.97 cph) was indeed lower than the Comp3.5 approach 
(i.e. 10.58 cph) based on a TTEV test: t(122) = 2.924, P = 0.004. The consolidated aesthetic scores for all of the 
compositions produced during those 72 cycles showed that there was no statistically significant difference 
between TG1500p (i.e. 2.360) and Comp3.5 (2.343) using two convention filters but there was when using 
none, i.e. 2.3 and 2.271, respectively, based on a TTUV test: t(8415) = -3.262, P = 0.0011. We also confirmed, 
as predicted, that using two convention filters, the aesthetics scores do, on average, improve compared to using 
no filters. This was true for both Comp3.5 (two filters: 2.343, none: 2.271) and TG1500p (two filters: 2.36, 
none: 2.3) based on a TTUV and TTEV test, respectively: t(1666) = 5.322, P < 0.0001 and t(5393) = 4.828, P < 
0.0001. 
 
So in summary, for more beautiful compositions (i.e. using two convention filters), the TG1500p approach is 
more efficient than the Comp3.5 approach. It produces more compositions in the same amount of composing 
time. Comp3.5 produces comparable compositions (in terms of aesthetic quality) but fewer. Using no 
convention filters, Comp3.5 produces more compositions than TG1500p but of lower aesthetic quality. So the 
TG1500p is clearly the better of the two approaches. Somehow, combining information from weak games and 
photographs of people (using the DSNS approach) outperforms using information from high quality chess 
compositions alone. Interestingly, based on ANOVA tests, there was also no statistically significant difference 

in average composing efficiency between the three computers used in all cases but one (i.e. TG1500p, two 
convention filters), where the weakest computer (PC3) actually performed the best: F (2, 69) = 3.1475, p < 0.05. 
Perhaps an indicator of a machine employing ‘genuine’ creativity is a demonstration that raw processing power 
does not necessarily improve performance; and that perhaps even a relatively low power machine can 
outperform higher power ones. In principle, creativity largely happens when it happens and can only be 
improved using a better approach or process rather than a faster machine.

The Sixth Experiment: Comparisons Against the State-of-the-Art 
 
The state-of-the-art with regard to a computational creativity approach and chess problem composition, to the 
best of our knowledge, is the ‘experience table’ described in (Iqbal, 2011). Essentially, it uses domain 
knowledge extracted from a database of 29,453 mostly published chess compositions by human composers, 
many of whom are of the expert and master level. The experience table is a table of probabilities that a piece of 
a particular type should exist on a particular square on the board. This information is used in the automatic 
composing process and was shown to outperform a random-placement approach (similar to the one used in 
section 4.3) and also experience tables derived from other ‘weaker’ sources. Full details are in the 
aforementioned reference. 
 
So in order to compare the DSNS approach with the experience table one, we used three pairings of chess three-
movers and photographs for the DSNS, and the original 29,453 source database for the ‘experience table’ 
approach. We used three pairings of the DSNS because there are many different ways even the best pairing can 
be represented, i.e. it is not limited to a particular set or size of chess sequences or photographs. The three 
pairings therefore provide a more balanced view of the DSNS. The experience table, on the other hand, was 
shown to perform best using the aforementioned dabatase so we used only that. The three DSNS pairings 
included the original TG1500p (as explained in section 4.4), and two others, i.e. 4,698 games between weak 
players with an Elo rating below 1600 in conjunction with 1,000 photographs of people (TG1600p1K for 
brevity), and TG1500 (see section 4.3) in conjunction with the same 1,000 photographs of people (TG1500p1K 
for brevity).  
 
We tested using no chess composition conventions, using two conventions (no checks in key move and no 
captures in key move) and using three conventions (the previous two and no cooked problems). In general, the 
more conventions applied, the higher the quality of the chess problems (Iqbal, 2014a). So for the tests we used 
one on the low end (i.e. no conventions) and two tests on the higher end. Table 15 shows the mean aesthetics 
scores of the compositions generated and the composing efficiency in compositions per hour (cph) based on 24 
cycles (as explained in section 4.7). For three conventions, we used 36 cycles because it takes longer to compose 
a reasonable amount of problems for statistical analysis.
