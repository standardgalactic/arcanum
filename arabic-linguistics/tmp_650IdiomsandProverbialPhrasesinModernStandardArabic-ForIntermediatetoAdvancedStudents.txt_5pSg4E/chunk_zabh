No one can scratch your itch as well as yourself can; nobody can help you

Your parents will not be able to care for your children anymore and, in the 
end, nobody can help you except yourself./To protect its national interest, the 
country needs to minimise its reliance on international aid and build up its 
own strength, as nobody can help you but yourself./Never depend on anyone 
but yourself; if you want a thing well done, do it yourself.
