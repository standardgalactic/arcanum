I know you are going through a bad time, but remember that patience is the 
key in this hour of uncertainty./Just hang in there, God is never late, and good 
things come to those who wait./You need a lot of patience and time to master 
pottery, after all patience is the key to success./After a diffcult year, the com­
pany has aspirations to gain a larger market share; what is needed is patience, 
and patience is the key to relief.
