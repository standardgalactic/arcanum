If you apply now, you have a great chance to get a scholarship this year; seize 
the opportunity while you can./We can pass the deal while the manager is 
absent; after all, you have to make hay while the sun shines./Now is the right 
time to buy a diverse range of shares for your portfolio; you should make hay 
while the sun shines.
