I am not upset that the dividend yield will go down, as I have no horse in this 
race; I have never bought a single stock in my life./We have nothing to do 
with what is happening in that neighbourhood./My father’s passion is sports, 
and he never troubles himself about politics; he has no horse in the race./I 
am not interested in space travel; I will continue to live on Earth, and I have 
no horse in this race.

God does not burden any soul more than it can bear; not take upon oneself 
more than one can bear or handle; to match duty, responsibility, or task with 
ability; there is not more that can be done.
