Many funny jokes target miserable situations that people face every day; 
some of the worst calamities bring laughter./The physician who came up with 
a low-carb diet died from obesity-related diseases; after all, worst calamity 
makes one laugh./The members of parliament voted to increase their pay 
while the public workers were on strike demanding higher wages; the worst 
hardships are those which bring laughter, so tragic it is hilarious.
