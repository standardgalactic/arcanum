The frequent visits to acquaintances lead to less respect; after all, absence 
makes the heart grow fonder./You lost her interest in you because you were 
sending her messages too often. Do you not know that distance keeps loved 
ones closer to you?/She stayed too long with her sister and ended up feeling 
unwelcome by her sister’s family. It is true what is said, that a constant guest 
is never welcome.

there is no point crying over spilled milk.
