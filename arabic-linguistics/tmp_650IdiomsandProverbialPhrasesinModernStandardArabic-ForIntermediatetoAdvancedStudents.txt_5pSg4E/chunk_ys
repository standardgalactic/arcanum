You should not care for strangers at the expense of your family; charity begins 
at home./The government should divert the foreign aid funds to cover the 
social care costs; charity begins at home.

It is the end that counts or matters; all is well that ends well; the proof is in 
the end result; deeds or actions are judged by their endings.

You have done a great deal of work on the development project so far, but 
remember, it is the achievement in the end that counts./The weak team was 
losing the match until it scored the winning goal in the last minutes; it is the 
end that counts, not the start.
