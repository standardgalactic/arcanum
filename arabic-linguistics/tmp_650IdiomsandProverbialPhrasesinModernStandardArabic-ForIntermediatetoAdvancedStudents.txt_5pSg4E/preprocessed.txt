Phrases in Modern Standard 
Arabic 
650 Idioms and Proverbial Phrases in Modern Standard Arabic is the ideal tool for 
learners of Arabic who wish to improve their knowledge and comprehension of 
Arabic language and culture and make their language more expressive and idiomatic. 
Including over 650 idiomatic expressions found in contemporary Arabic, this 
book is divided into two parts. Part I lists the idioms alphabetically for ease of use, 
providing English equivalents and a range of illustrative example sentences to show 
how the idioms are used in different contexts. The idioms are chosen based on 
frequency of use in written Arabic as well as oral speech, in Arabic literature and mass 
media. Part II includes 30 practice exercises structured around original texts which 
include the idioms covered in Part I. These practice exercises encourage students to 
review the meanings of idioms while improving their reading skills and familiarity 
with various text genres. 
Designed to be comprehensive, accurate, and easy to use, the book reﬂects the 
daily use of Arabic and draws on real and authentic use of the language. Suitable for 
use as a textbook or reader, this is an ideal resource for students at CEFR level B1 to 
C2 or Intermediate-High to Advanced-High on the ACTFL proﬁciency scale.

Preface 
Idioms and proverbs are used in everyday life in the Arab World, ranging from 
spoken colloquial to standard Arabic.  650 Idioms and Proverbial Phrases in 
MSA is a textbook and reader that focuses on standard Arabic idioms and 
proverbs. The aim of this textbook is to develop the knowledge and under­
standing of idioms in Arabic. Furthermore, it aims to enhance the learner’s 
skills in Modern Standard Arabic through its integrative approach that brings 
all skills together. 
This book is suitable for students of Arabic who need to improve their 
understanding of Arabic idioms and proverbs and to gain ﬂuency in the lan­
guage. The book is also an indispensable source for students, scholars, trans­
lators, and all professionals who deal with Arabic. 
650 Idioms and Proverbial Phrases in MSA explains and exercises the 
idioms in a way that reﬂects not only the idioms’ meanings but also incor­
porates real life examples that bring together language, context, and culture. 
The book has two parts: 
Part I includes 29 chapters, and covers over 650 common Arabic idi­
oms and proverbs, which are alphabetically ordered. They are diacritically 
marked to show their correct pronunciations, according to the most reli­
able Arabic literature sources. The meanings of each idiom/proverb are given 
in English, then model sentences are presented, together with their English 
translations. These examples show the idiom’s typical contextual use, and 
elucidate the grammatical peculiarities, the morphological modiﬁcations, 
and the cultural aspects of the idiom. The model examples are also diacriti­
cally marked where needed to display grammatical and syntactic features, to 
demonstrate accurate pronunciation of the words, and to make it easier for 
the learner to fully comprehend the modiﬁcations that occur to the Arabic 
grammatical modes.

Preface 
Signiﬁcant efforts have been made to ﬁnd the most accurate meaning for 
each idiom/proverb in Arabic and English. We went through many sources 
in both languages, comparing and analysing texts and materials to determine 
how the idioms/proverbs are used and in which context. We have noticed 
that inaccurate translations of some Arabic idioms are widely used today. 
One example is “false friends,” expressions that have similar forms in both 
instance is commonly and wrongly translated as “truth be told.” While it is 
used in English to admit or tell the truth about something negative, it is used 
in Arabic to express a positive opinion in defense of someone’s action. It is 
never used in Arabic to express negative thoughts. 
Part II includes 30 practice exercises; each has a text that uses idioms 
from Part I . We have written the texts speciﬁcally for this book, and they are 
diverse in their themes, styles, and genres. All the texts are ﬁctional, and 
they come in the form of short stories, reports, political analysis, articles, 
football match report, a letter of thanks, a formal speech, ofﬁcial statements, 
a Maqamah (Arabic rhymed prose), a eulogy, and a court ruling. The idi­
oms and proverbs are presented for study and practice in natural contexts 
within language usage that is informative, enjoyable, and simulates reality. 
Furthermore, the practice exercises concentrate on familiarising the student 
with the meanings of the idioms and proverbs and how they are used in dif­
ferent contexts and writing styles. Part II also can be used independently as a 
reader to enhance the student’s skills in reading and analysing different texts 
and genres in Arabic. 
This textbook/reader is indispensable for anyone who wants to develop 
and enrich their Arabic language and make it more expressive.

some of the worst calamities bring laughter./The physician who came up with 
a low-carb diet died from obesity-related diseases; after all, worst calamity 
makes one laugh./The members of parliament voted to increase their pay 
while the public workers were on strike demanding higher wages; the worst 
hardships are those which bring laughter, so tragic it is hilarious.

The couple felt bad because they had to postpone their honeymoon, but it 
turned out to be a blessing in disguise. Their holiday would have been spoiled 
by the storm./– “I did not get accepted into medical school” – “Never mind; 
maybe it is for the best, and maybe it is a blessing in disguise.”

The situation is deteriorating; we need to act right now before we reach a 
stage in which we will say it is too late./Because of the government’s patch­
work, the food crisis will become a disaster and, by then, the government 
may have missed the boat./If you do not stop eating fatty and sugary foods 
soon, you will put your health in danger within months, and then it will be 
too late.

It is just amazing, this Bedouin boy plays the rababa in the same way as his 
father; like father, like son./Despite totally different circumstances, the young 
man is an embodiment of his father’s optimism and success; like father, like

She suffered at his hand for years, and she had to wait in patience for ven­
geance to be accomplished. Now justice is served; the mills of God grind 
slowly./God almighty takes revenge for the oppressed from the oppressor, 
even after a while, though the mills of God grind slowly, yet they grind 
exceedingly small.
