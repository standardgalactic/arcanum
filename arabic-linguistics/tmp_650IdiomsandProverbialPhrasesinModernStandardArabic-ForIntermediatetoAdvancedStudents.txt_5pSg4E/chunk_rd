Since she began singing, she always knew deep down that she wanted to be 
a professional singer./I may criticise him sometimes, but deep down in my 
heart, I love him for his kind heart./We are having these anxieties because we 
know deep down that we should not be dealing with these issues./I always 
hoped in my heart of hearts that my ex-wife would come back.

The rocket crossed the distance in the blink of an eye./Quick as a fash, the pho­
tographer captured a magnifcent picture of the cheetah./Summer has arrived 
in the blink of an eye this year./The genie disappeared in the blink of an eye 
after he granted him the three wishes./The thieves opened the safe in no time.
