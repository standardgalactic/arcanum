The baker has a great sense of humour and always puts a smile on the faces of 
his customers./The story was comical and deep; it made me laugh and think 
a lot./My friend is humorous; it is a lot of fun being with him.

A cloud of grief descended on the capital as the news of the massacre 
spread./A deep sadness pervaded his soul whenever the song played./Deep 
grief descended on us when we heard the sad news./Sadness took over their 
whole life for so many years.
