The architect Sinimmaar built a great palace for king Al-Nu’maan. The king 
was very impressed by the palace and did not want the architect to build a 
similar palace for anyone else, so he ordered the architect to be killed, and 
that was the reward of Sinimmaar./When he needed a kidney transplant, his 
wife donated one of her kidneys to him; but within 18 months, he divorced 
her and remarried. Poor woman, she got the reward of Sinimmaar.

As you sow, so you reap; they that sow the wind shall reap the whirlwind; karma; 
what goes around comes around; evil be to him who evil thinks; the biter gets bit.
