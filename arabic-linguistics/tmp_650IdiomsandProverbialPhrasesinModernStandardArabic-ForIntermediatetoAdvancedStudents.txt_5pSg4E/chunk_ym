He helped him to become president, but instead of being rewarded for his 
efforts, the president threw him into prison. Beware of him whom you have 
done good deeds./The civil servants were working hard to provide the best 
services possible but, instead of rewarding them, the government cut their 
wages. Truly, no good deed goes unpunished./She was an opportunist who 
paid his kindness with betrayal and evil. Beware of evil that may come from 
one whom you helped.
