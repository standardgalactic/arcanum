The way you work will kill you; you should remember that God does not 
burden any soul more than it can bear./You are feeling exhausted and drained 
from too much exercise; your strength has its limits, and you should not take 
upon yourself more than you can bear./You have given your family your time 
and money, and you cannot do more. God does not burden any soul more 
than it can bear./The budget is not enough to meet all the basic needs of the 
country for this year, and there is not more that can be done.

A believer is not stung twice by something out of the same burrow; a fox is 
not caught twice in the same snare; once bitten, twice shy; so a fool returns 
to his folly; do not make the same mistake twice.
