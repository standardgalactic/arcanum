Preface 
Idioms and proverbs are used in everyday life in the Arab World, ranging from 
spoken colloquial to standard Arabic.  650 Idioms and Proverbial Phrases in 
MSA is a textbook and reader that focuses on standard Arabic idioms and 
proverbs. The aim of this textbook is to develop the knowledge and under­
standing of idioms in Arabic. Furthermore, it aims to enhance the learner’s 
skills in Modern Standard Arabic through its integrative approach that brings 
all skills together. 
This book is suitable for students of Arabic who need to improve their 
understanding of Arabic idioms and proverbs and to gain ﬂuency in the lan­
guage. The book is also an indispensable source for students, scholars, trans­
lators, and all professionals who deal with Arabic. 
650 Idioms and Proverbial Phrases in MSA explains and exercises the 
idioms in a way that reﬂects not only the idioms’ meanings but also incor­
porates real life examples that bring together language, context, and culture. 
The book has two parts: 
Part I includes 29 chapters, and covers over 650 common Arabic idi­
oms and proverbs, which are alphabetically ordered. They are diacritically 
marked to show their correct pronunciations, according to the most reli­
able Arabic literature sources. The meanings of each idiom/proverb are given 
in English, then model sentences are presented, together with their English 
translations. These examples show the idiom’s typical contextual use, and 
elucidate the grammatical peculiarities, the morphological modiﬁcations, 
and the cultural aspects of the idiom. The model examples are also diacriti­
cally marked where needed to display grammatical and syntactic features, to 
demonstrate accurate pronunciation of the words, and to make it easier for 
the learner to fully comprehend the modiﬁcations that occur to the Arabic 
grammatical modes.
