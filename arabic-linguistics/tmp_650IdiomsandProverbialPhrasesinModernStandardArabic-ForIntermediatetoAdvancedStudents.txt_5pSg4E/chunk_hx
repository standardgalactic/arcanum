My friend is playful and quick-witted. She has an amazing ability to think 
and respond quickly./It is impossible to be bored when talking to him; 
he has a quick mind and a splendid gift for repartee./His ability to keep 
a sense of humour and think on his feet was evident when he gave that 
witty reply.

Luck is on one’s side; to get lucky; to strike it lucky.
