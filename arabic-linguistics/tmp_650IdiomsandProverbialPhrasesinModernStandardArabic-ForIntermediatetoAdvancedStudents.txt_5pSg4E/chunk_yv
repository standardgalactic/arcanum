The city residents are the ones who best know the needs of their city; as the 
proverb goes, “The people of Mecca know best their valleys.”/When travel-
ling abroad, try to eat where locals eat, as locals know best./The government 
knows best how to defend the interests of the country, and the ambassador’s 
interference in the country’s internal affairs is not acceptable.

the tiny acorn grows the mighty oak.
