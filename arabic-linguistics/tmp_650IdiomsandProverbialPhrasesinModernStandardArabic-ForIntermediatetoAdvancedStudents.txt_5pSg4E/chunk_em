I was late for the interview, I had forgotten to take the required paperwork, 
and worst of all, I discovered I was in the wrong building./Someone stole my 
car keys, worse yet, I am lost and do not have my phone with me./An airline 
of this size does not have online booking, and what is even worse is they will 
not properly explain their position. 
 ُﮫَﻣَد َرَﺪْ َھأ
To forfeit one’s life or blood; to declare a justifable homicide; the loss of 
tribal protection and blood vengeance when killed.
