You have to read between the lines to understand what the writer implies 
in his article./I have watched the interview, and you could read between 
the lines that he did not appreciate the government’s response to the envi­
ronmental issues./I am trying to develop my skills in reading between the 
lines.

Pressed on one hand by the state’s secular laws, on the other by the 
religious laws, he found himself between the hammer and the anvil./
