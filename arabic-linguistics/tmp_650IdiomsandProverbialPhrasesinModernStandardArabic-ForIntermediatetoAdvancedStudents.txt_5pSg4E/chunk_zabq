The situation is deteriorating; we need to act right now before we reach a 
stage in which we will say it is too late./Because of the government’s patch­
work, the food crisis will become a disaster and, by then, the government 
may have missed the boat./If you do not stop eating fatty and sugary foods 
soon, you will put your health in danger within months, and then it will be 
too late.

It is just amazing, this Bedouin boy plays the rababa in the same way as his 
father; like father, like son./Despite totally different circumstances, the young 
man is an embodiment of his father’s optimism and success; like father, like 
son.

Retribution may be delayed, but it is sure to overtake the evil; though the 
mills of God grind slowly, yet they grind exceedingly small.
