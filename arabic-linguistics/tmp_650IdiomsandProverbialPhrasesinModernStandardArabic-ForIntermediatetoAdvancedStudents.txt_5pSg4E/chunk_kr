Giacomo Casanova was the most notorious womaniser in history. His mem­
oir describes his amorous encounters in detail./Some cultures accept that a 
man can be a ladies’ man, having multiple lovers and concubines./He was 
a philanderer and indulged in many sexual activities, but he later regretted 
taking such actions.
