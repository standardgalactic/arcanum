a decadal scale. To bring both sets of data to a common temporal resolution, 
I smoothed Lee's index using an exponential kernel regression with bandwidth 
h = 10 years, and resampled the resulting curve at 10-year intervals, giving me 
the variable W, (t = -200,-190, ... , 1700, 1710 c.E.). In other words, I treated 
the internal warfare data in the same way as population data (see Section 8.3.1).

Because the functional form of/(·) in equation (8.1) is not known, I approximated it using the response surface methodology (RSM) of Box and Draper 
( 1987). RSM is a modified polynomial approximation scheme, in which the predictor variables (in this case, N,_, and W,_,) are subjected to the Box-Cox transformation. There was strong evidence for curvilinear effects (see below), and thus 
I used second-degree polynomials to approximate/(·). For the analysis I broke 
the whole time series from -200 to 1710 c.E. into three equal-length pieces of 64 
data points each (this is the identical procedure to that used in Section 8.3.1). It 
reduces the influence of nonstationarity, and also allows us to check on whether 
the relationship between population dynamics and political instability changes 
with period. Finally, to make sure that a specific choice of the base lag T does 
not unduly affect the results, I performed all analyses for two choices, T = 20 
and 30 years.

There was a highly significant effect of political instability on population dynamics in all three periods and for both choices of T (Table 8.2). The density 
dependence and political instability jointly explained around 60% of the variance 
in r,. The direction of the effect was as expected from theory (Figure 8. 7).

Population density had a negative effect on the population rate of change, 
reflecting the basic density-dependent pattern of population dynamics. Political 
instability also had a negative effect on population increase. Interestingly, the 
effects of density and instability were synergistic, as indicated by a statistically 
significant interaction term. We can see this effect in Figure 8.7: the population decline was particularly pronounced if both population density and political 
instability were high.
