Long-term swings or waves on the scale of centuries have been commented 
on by a number of authors. Cameron (1989) referred to them as the "logistics," 
Braudel (1988) as the "secular trends," and Fischer (1996) as the "great wave," 
to give just a few examples. The logistic is a term that I prefer to reserve for 
the logistic equation, an essential building block of many models considered in 
this book. The logistic is a first-order model and is not capable of second-order 
oscillations such as those predicted by demographic-structural models. Thus, calling these cycles "logistics" would cause no end of confusion. "Secular trends" 
is a much better term, because one meaning of "secular" refers to very long 
changes occurring on the scale of centuries. However, a "trend" usually refers to 
a monotonic increase or decrease, while the dynamics predicted by demographicstructural models predict up-and-down swings. For this reason, I propose that we 
call these dynamics secular cycles or secular waves. The first term may be used 
if we want to emphasize the quasiperiodic nature of dynamics, the second if we 
want to emphasize the irregular up and down pattern (both dynamics are predicted by the models, depending on the structural assumptions). I would further 
distinguish another category: "elite cycles," in which the general population does 
not change very much, but most of the action is due to elite interactions.

7.3 EMPIRICAL APPLICATIONS 
7 .3.1 Periodic Breakdowns of Early Modem States 
The demographic-structural theory of Jack Goldstone (199lb) makes detailed and 
quantitative predictions about interrelations between such variables as population 
growth, inflation rate, state fiscal distress, intraelite competition, and popular discontent. The theory, thus, can be empirically tested by examining the historical 
record and determining whether the hypothesized relationships held in different 
instances of state breakdown. This was the approach followed by Goldstone, 
who chose four cases studies for a detailed examination: the English and French 
Revolutions, the Ottoman crisis of the seventeenth century, and the Ming-Qing 
transition in China (as well as less detailed comparisons to a few other early 
modem polities). I will focus on the English Revolution of the seventeenth century, because the data base documenting various dynamic variables is the most 
complete in this case.

The population history of England is known better than for any other region in the world (see Chapter 8). After the fourteenth-century decline and 
fifteenth-century stability, the population began to grow rapidly. Between 1500 
and 1640 c.E. the population more than doubled. The first consequence of this 
THE DEMOGRAPHIC-STRUCTURAL THEORY 141 
growth was a drastic decline in the land/peasant ratio. For example, whereas prior 
to 1560, 57% of landholdings were 1 acre or greater in size, after 1620 only 36% 
were in that category. What was worse, there was a drastic increase of landless 
peasants (those that had only a cottage with garden): their proportion increased 
from 11% before 1560 to 40% after 1620 (data from Everitt 1967; Goldstone 
1991b: Table 1). These data indicate that by 1650 land was in short supply. Even 
though land must have been more intensively cultivated (because the labor supply grew), the food production per capita should have declined between 1500 
and 1640 due to the law of diminishing returns. A clear indication that this happened was a drastic increase in the price of grain: a rise of 600% from 1500 to 
1640. According to Goldstone's (1991b: Table 3) analysis, a simple regression 
model with a log-transformed population, an index of harvest quality, and time 
(the dummy variable for technical change) as independent variables explains 99% 
of the variance in the log-transformed prices.

The second major consequence of population growth was the increasing fiscal 
strain on the English state. The state finances, strong under Henry VII, deteriorated by the mid-sixteenth century, when ordinary revenues started to lag behind 
expenses, and finally collapsed in the early seventeenth century (Figure 7.6a).

The basic problem was that, while the Crown income kept pace with inflation, 
the real expenses increased with population. First, increased population meant 
larger armies and fleets. Second, the expanded elite numbers imposed greater patronage costs on the state. Increasingly, from the mid-sixteenth century on, the 
Crown was forced to sell assets, levy forced loans, and seek parliamentary grants 
even in peacetime (Goldstone 1991b:93). By the 1630s, Crown lands were largely 
gone, and the unpaid Crown debt reached the point where the interest on it was 
greater than the ordinary revenues. Furthermore, prior efforts to secure extraordinary revenues had alienated the elites to the point where they were unlikely to 
acquiesce to further fiscal demands or entreaties by the Crown.

While the general population doubled between 1500 and 1640, the numbers 
of the elite expanded even faster. Whereas in 1540 there were 6300 gentry families, in 1600 (only 60 years later) there were 16,500. This number further increased to 18,500 in 1640, then declined to 16,400 in 1688, after the Civil War.

In 1760 there were still only 18,000 gentry families-less than at the 1640 peak 
(Goldstone 199lb:l13). The drastic increase of elite numbers affected all strata: 
between 1540 and 1640 the number of peers increased from 60 to 160, baronets 
and knights from 500 to 1400, esquires from 800 to 3000, and armigerous gentry 
from 5000 to 15,000 (Stone 1972:72). The consequence of this rapid expansion 
(especially during the second half of the sixteenth century) was increased competition for jobs and patronage. Goldstone argues that one way of measuring 
.this competition is by examining the data on university enrollments. University 
enrollments increased drastically during the second half of the sixteenth century 
and reached a peak in 1640. By the 1750s, when intraelite competition greatly 
subsided, the enrollments declined to pre-1600 levels (Figure 7.6b). Another indicator of intraelite competition is the amount of litigation among gentry. Between 
1640 and 1750, the number of gentry who appeared in the Courts of Common
