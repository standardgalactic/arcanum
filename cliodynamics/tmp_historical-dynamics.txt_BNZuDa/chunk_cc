indicates how improvement in k depends on S (when S = s0 , k(S) has been 
improved by cl2).

Putting together equations (7.1)-(7.3) we have the complete demographic-fiscal 
model (because it focuses on the fiscal health of the state as the main structural 
variable). The model has six parameters: p0, ~. r, k0 , c, and s0 , but we can 
reduce this set to four, by scaling N' = NI k0 and S' = SI p0• This procedure 
leaves us with the following parameters: ~' = ~lp , r, c, and s' = s0lp0 • The 
scaled equations are 
N=rN(l- k~)) 
S=N (1- _!!__) -~N k(S) 
s k(S)=l+c-- s0+S 
(7.4) 
(where I dropped the primes for better readability). I also impose the condition 
S ~ 0 (that ·is, the state is not allowed to go into debt).

Model Dynamics 
The typical dynamics of the demographic-fiscal model are shown in Figure 7.1a.

Starting with the initial value of S = 0 and population numbers N = k012, the 
model predicts that initially both N and S will grow. As S increases, so does the 
carrying capacity k(S}, which quickly approaches the upper limit kmax. For this 
reason, the growth of N does not stop at k0 , but continues beyond that critical 
value. However, at a certain population size Ncrit• well before N approaches kmax• 
the growth of state resources ceases, and S begins to collapse at an increasing rate, 
rapidly reaching 0. This means that k(S) also decreases to k0 , and the population 
size rapidly follows suit.

The mechanics underlying the collapse of S are illustrated in Figure 7.1 b. The 
rate of change of S is determined by the balance of two opposing forces: revenues 
and expenditures. When N is low, increasing it results in greater revenues (more 
workers means more taxes). The growth in state expenditures lags behind the revenues, and the state's surplus accumulates. As N increases, however, the growth 
in revenues ceases, and actually begins to decline. This is a result of diminishing 
returns on agricultural labor. However, the expenditures continue to mount. At 
population density N = Ncrit• the revenues and expenditures become (briefly) balanced. Unfortunately, population growth continues toward the carrying capacity, 
k, and the gap between the state's expenditures and revenues rapidly becomes 
catastrophic. As a result, the state quickly spends any resources that have been 
accumulated during better times. When S becomes zero, the state is unable to 
pay the army, the bureaucrats, and maintain infrastructure: the state collapses.

The equilibrium N = k0 and S = 0 is locally stable. This means that, once 
the state has collapsed, small perturbations in either population size or state resources do not lead away from this equilibrium. In order for another cycle of

state building-collapse to get going, either N must be decreased below (1-{3), 
or S must be increased above s0/( c({J- 1 - 1) - 1 ]. Thus, in a deterministic world, 
once the state collapses, it cannot arise again. In a stochastic world, where a 
variety of exogenous factors affect both N and S, it is a matter of time before a 
strong enough perturbation will start the model trajectory going on another state 
building-collapse cycle. For example, I incorporated stochasticity in the model

by adding once a year to S a random Gaussian number with mean 0 and a 
small standard deviation u = 0.1s0 • The dynamics of the stochastic demographicfiscal model were characterized by recurrent cycles of state building and collapse 
(Figure 7 .2). Note that once the state cycle gets going, its duration is well determined by initial conditions. By contrast, the stateless periods between cyclesintercycles-are quite variable in length (because the system must wait until a 
strong enough perturbation comes about).

A numerical investigation of the influence of parameters on model dynamics 
indicated that the average length of a political cycle was mainly determined by the 
value of r, and to a lesser extent by {3. The parameter c affects the amplitude of 
oscillations, since it determines by how much kmax is greater than k0 • Parameter s0 
determines whether oscillations occur or not: if it is set too high, then k(S) never
