up to the middle of the fourth century. He assumes that in 40 c.E. there were 
about a thousand Christians and that they grew exponentially at the relative rate 
of 40% per decade. (Stark's use of the exponential model is not really at variance 
with our model of logistic growth, because the two processes generate essentially 
the same quantitative predictions for the early stages of growth, and begin to diverge only after the proportion converted exceeds 10-20%.) One thousand people 
corresponded to 0.0017% of the population of the Roman Empire. By 200 c.E., 
Stark's projection predicts that there was still less than 1% of the Roman population who converted to Christianity (0.36%, to be precise). Then, the projected 
growth "suddenly" takes off: 1.9% in 250 c.E., 10.5% in 300 c.E., and 56.5% in 
350 c.E. (Stark 1996: Table 1.1). In other words, the startling expansion of Christianity during the period of 250-350 c.E., as compared to an apparent lack of 
growth during 50-250 c.E. (the "latent period" in epidemiological terms), could 
have happened without any change in the underlying mechanism of conversion.

As long as the early Christians managed to keep their social networks open, they 
would continue to connect to and convert new members at the same relative rate 
of change, and the end result would be an eventual explosion of the size of the 
Christian community.

Stark derived the parameters for the projected conversion curve (the initial 
number at 40 c.E. and the relative rate of growth) by integrating over rather

heterogeneous quantitative and qualitative information from various sources (see 
Stark 1996:4-12). Several years after he made these estimates, a colleague of 
Stark attracted his attention to the reconstruction by Roger Bagnal1 of the growth 
of Christianity in Egypt. Bagnall examined Egyptian papyri to identify the proportion of persons with identifiably Christian names in various years (Stark 1996: 
12-13). Comparing Stark's projected curve to these independent data constitutes 
a strong test of the theory (in fact, this is a true experimental test, since Stark 
was unaware of Bagnall's data when he constructed his prediction). Figure 6.7 
illustrates the results of this test. The match is quite good, and the coefficient 
of prediction is a very respectable R~ = 0.74. Thus, this test provides a strong 
quantitative confirmation of the theory.

6.3.3 The Growth of the Mormon Church 
The last case study concerns the growth of a modem religion, the Mormons.

The data are the total number of members in the Church of the Latter Day 
Saints from 1840 to 1980, and are tabulated by Stark (1984). Iri order to fit the 
logistic model to these data I need to convert them to proportions. Because the 
Mormon church is a world religion, with branches on all inhabited continents, 
I expressed the data as the proportion of the world population converted. This 
procedure probably overestimates the population of potential converts, because 
the targets of Mormon conversion are those who are not strongly committed to 
some other religion. However, this caveat does not affect the analysis results, 
because Mormons are very far from the conversion midpoint, no matter how we 
define the population at "risk of conversion," and thus the autocatalytic model 
predicts that they should be growing in an essentially exponential fashion.

nature of the growth, which characterizes the autocatalytic dynamics at low C.

Fitting the logistic curve to these data indicated that the model explains 98.9% 
of the variance. Thus, again we obtain a remarkable fit between the theoretical 
prediction and the observed trajectory (Figure 6.8).

6.4 CONCLUSION: DATA SUPPORT THE AUTOCATALYTIC MODEL 
The results of empirical tests are summarized in Table 6.1. The most striking 
feature of these results is just how well the autocatalytic model fits the data (or 
predicts, as in the case of Christianity), especially given how simple the model 
is. It only has two fitted parameters (the initial condition, C(O), and the relative 
conversion rate, r). The important implication is that not everything in history is
