data from Brooks 1989, cited in Goldstone).

The final ingredient in Goldstone's theory of state breakdown is the mass mobilization potential (MMP) of the general populace. Of particular relevance are the 
urbanized workers and artisans, especially in the capital, because they are located 
near the centers of power. Goldstone proposed that there are three measurable 
components in the MMP. First, we can measure the degree of misery affecting 
the urban masses by the dynamics of real wages (for example, the average laborer 
wages expressed in the amount of food they can buy). Second, a youthful age 
structure increases the mobilization potential of the crowd. Third, urban growth 
concentrates the poor young sons, and thus could play an important multiplier 
role in further amplifying the popular discontent brought about by increasing 
poverty. Goldstone proposed the following formula for combining the effects of 
these three mechanisms in one measure of mass mobilization potential: 
MMP = W +(W -1) UA I w, w, I I 
where W, is the real wage in decade t and W is the average real wage for the 
period 1500-1750. The lower the current real wage in relation to the long-term 
average, the greater is the ratio W jW,. The second term reflects the interactive 
effects of urbanization and age structure. U, was defined by Goldstone as the 
weighted average of London's growth over the decade and the preceding two 
decades, and A, is the proportion of the population 10-29 years old to the population aged over 30 years. Thus, the second term says that U, and A, will amplify 
the effects of W, if W, < W, and otherwise will not have much of an effect 
on the MMP. The estimated MMP for England during 1530-1750 is plotted in 
Figure 7.6c.

To summarize, the case of the English Revolution provides a great degree of 
empirical support for the demographic-structural theory of Goldstone. The three 
ingredients of the revolution were the state's financial crisis, acute competition 
and factionalism among the elites, and the existence of a large body of disaffected 
commoners who could be mobilized by parliamentary leaders against the royalists 
in London. Measures of all these processes increased during the second half 
of the sixteenth and the early seventeenth centuries, and peaked around 1640 
(Figure 7 .6).

7 .3.2 The Great Wave 
As I noted above, the value of the demographic-structural theory (Goldstone 
1991b) lies in its detailed analysis of the interrelations between important social 
variables mediating the effect of population growth on state stability (or, rather, 
instability). The enormous amount of quantitative material collected by Goldstone 
on state breakdown in early modem Europe and Asia provides a solid empirical foundation for his theory. Yet the theory is incomplete: while the effect of 
population dynamics on state stability is extremely well documented, the feed-
back effect on population is not. In Goldstone's theory population dynamics is 
an exogenous variable.

A more complete description of the interactions between population numbers 
and sociopolitical stability was given in the (verbal) model advanced by the historian David Hackett Fischer (1996). Fischer proposed that during the period 
of 1200-2000 c.E., western Europe went through four "great waves" of socioeconomic change (Fisher was not the first to notice these waves; I return to 
this issue in the beginning of Chapter 8). These long-term dynamics were reflected in the history of prices (Figure 7 .7), in which periods of price equilibrium 
(roughly, the Renaissance, the Enlightenment, and the Victorian Era) were interspersed with periods of rapid inflation (the "price revolutions" of the thirteenth, 
sixteenth, eighteenth, and twentieth centuries). Fischer argues that price movements are correlated with a comprehensive set of societal variables. Periods of 
price equilibrium were characterized by prolonged prosperity, flowering of the 
arts, and the spread of optimistic ideologies. Periods following price revolutions 
were characterized by widespread misery, political disorder, social disruption, and 
a growing mood of cultural anxiety (Fischer 1996:237).

Fischer's explanation of this wavelike pattern can be summarized as follows 
( 1996:246-251 ). During the late stage of a price equilibrium, material conditions 
are improving, social stability is increasing, and cultural expectations are growing 
brighter. People respond by marrying earlier and having more children; population begins to grow. The aggregate demand grows faster than supply, and prices, 
especially of food and fuel, begin to rise. Eventually, these developments create 
conditions for increased poverty; they put a strain on social relationships and 
intensify class conflicts. Public revenues fall behind expenditures, and the states 
are reduced to near insolvency. The cultural mood changes; there is a sense of

young people, who find it difficult to get good jobs or start a family. Finally, a
