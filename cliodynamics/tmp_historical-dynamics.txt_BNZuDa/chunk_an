
Thus, the imperial collapses occurring in the Hanneman model appear to be 
entirely due to the assumed delay with which legitimacy follows war success.

2.3 CONCLUSION: GEOPOLITICS AS A FIRST-ORDER PROCESS 
I started this chapter by reviewing some elementary facts from nonlinear dynamics for the following reasons. Most social scientists are not closely familiar with 
dynamical systems theory, and I wanted to present a nontechnical summary of its 
insights most relevant to the issues dealt with in this book. One such particular 
insight is that there is a close relationship between the time scales at which negative feedbacks operate and the nature of the dynamics. If feedback mechanisms 
operate much faster than the dynamics of the focal variable, then the system 
cannot oscillate or even exhibit a single boom/bust behavior. If we do have an 
oscillatory system, then, more quantitatively, the speed with which a feedback 
acts determines the temporal pattern of the dynamics (for example, the average 
length of an oscillation, or a boom/bust cycle). This means that if a feedback loop 
operates on the scale of years, or even worse, weeks, then it is highly unlikely 
that it could cause oscillations, whose average period is measured in centuries.

Centuries-long cycles are typically caused by feedbacks operating on the scale of 
human generations (decades or longer).

This insight is very relevant to the issue of what mechanisms underlie imperial boom/bust cycles. Empires grow and decline on the time scale of centuries 
(Taagepera 1978a, 1978b, 1997; see also Figure 4.4 in Chapter 4). Let us make 
a simple analysis of the imperial growth/decline data tabulated in the Appendix 
of Taagepera (1997). Taagepera defined the rise phase as the time it takes for a 
polity to expand from 20% to 80% of its maximum area (1997: 480). We can 
define the decline phase analogously, as the time needed to decline from 80% to 
20% of the maximum, and the peak phase as the time from the end of the rise to 
the beginning of the decline. Table 2.1 gives the phase durations for the 31 polities from Taagepera (1997), that had four or more consecutive area observations 
(we need these data points to unambiguously define the phases). There is a large 
amount of variation in the durations of decline phases for these polities. In about 
half of the cases (14) the decline phase was on the order of one human generation (less than 0.3 centuries). The rest of empires exhibited longer decline phases,

polities listed by Taagepera (1997: Appendix).

with 12 cases declining for one century or longer. Thus, Table 2.1 suggests that 
slow imperial declines are commonly found in the historical record.

My main argument in this chapter is that geopolitical variables (in the narrow sense) cannot explain the long-term (a century or longer) imperial decline 
phases. Such geopolitical variables as logistic loads and loss of marchland advantage begin operating essentially without a time lag. As soon as more territory 
GEOPOLITICS 27 
is conquered, the state must shoulder the burden of defending it from external 
and internal (rebellion) threats. Similarly, as soon as the victorious state intrudes 
on a central location, any previous marchland advantage is diminished. It is true 
that the benefits of increased size can come with a substantial lag, because it 
takes time to organize production in newly conquered territory and to persuade 
the populace there to accept state authority. But this mechanism is part of the 
positive feedback loop; it is not what causes empires to decline. In an interesting extension of the usual geopolitical variables, Collins and co-authors proposed 
that the relationship between state legitimacy and war success may cause territorial overshoot, followed by collapse. However, our investigation of this idea 
suggested that this mechanism still leads to first-order dynamics (metastability), 
unless we impose an unrealistically (as I would argue) long lag on the response 
of legitimacy to war success. Furthermore, even if we stipulate such a long lag, 
only one of the models investigated by Hanneman et al. exhibited boom-bust 
cycles, and the collapse in this model was accomplished in essentially one time 
step. By contrast, historical data suggest that imperial decline often occurs on the 
time scale of decades or even centuries (Table 2.1 ). This empirical pattern is not 
explained by purely geopolitical theories.

The importance of time scales has not, of course, escaped previous theorists.

Collins devotes several pages to discussing this issue (Collins 1995:1584-1586), 
Kennedy (1987) repeatedly stresses that the state's military strength and productive ability are correlated in the long term, and we certainly should not forget 
Braudel's (1972) la longue duree. However, the discussion of this issue typically 
does not get beyond verbal theories. It is precisely in these kinds of quantitative 
issues that nonlinear dynamics can be of great use, because formulating explicit 
models allows us to build in the empirically based characteristics of postulated 
mechanisms (including their rates of change) and predict the ensuing model dynamics (for example, the temporal durations of the rise and decline phases).

Pushing through such an exercise can help us reject some rival hypotheses. Development of geopolitical models in this chapter is an example of this general
