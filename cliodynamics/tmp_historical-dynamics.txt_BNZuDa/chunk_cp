8.3 LONG-TERM EMPIRICAL PATTERNS 
8.3.1 Reconstructions of Historical Populations 
I begin with what I consider the best data set, the population history of England 
and Wales between 1080 and 2000 c.B. (Figure 8.1 ). This data set involves the 
least amount of guesswork, compared to the rest (with the exception of the archaeological data). For the period of 1800-2000, we can use the results of regular 
censuses. The period of 1540-1800 is almost as solid, because it is based on the 
excellent work by Wrigley, Schofield, and eo-workers, who used the technique of 
population reconstruction based on parish records documenting births and deaths 
during this period (Wrigley and Schofield 1981; Wrigley et al. 1997). The earliest 
period, from 1080 to 1540 c.B. (taken from Wrigley 1969), is the one where the 
subjective element is the strongest. Still, the population dynamics of medieval 
England are known as well as those for any other country. At the beginning of

Figure 8.1 Population of England and Wales, 1080-2000 c.E. Population numbers, in 
millions, sampled every 10 years, are plotted on a log scale. Trend: fitted curve Y =a+ 
bX8, where Y =logN(t) and X is time scaled to the interval 0-l. ACF: the autocorrelation 
function of the detrended data. All time units (including ACF lags) are in centuries.

the period, the population record is anchored in the Domesday Book census. The 
timing of the population collapse associated with the Black Death is also solidly 
dated. The uncertainty primarily concerns the height of the pre-Black Death peak 
and the depth of the postplague collapse (Hatcher 1996).

Two features are readily apparent on Figure 8.1. The first is the increasing 
trend. The trend is nonlinear and greatly accelerates around 1800. The mechanism underlying this trend is probably uncontroversial (the Industrial Revolution), 
and does not concern us here. To quantitatively characterize the trend, I fitted a 
power relationship to the data in Figure 8.1. The second feature of the data is the 
oscillation around the general trend. In order to be able to characterize the oscillatory component, I detrended the series by subtracting the fitted power curve 
from the data.

The detrended data were subjected to time-series analysis. First, we calculate 
the autocorrelation function (shown as the inset in Figure 8.1), which has a clear 
oscillatory tendency, reaching the first peak at 3.1 centuries. The next step is 
to apply some standard tools from the population dynamicist's kit (time-series 
techniques for the analysis of population data are described in Thrchin 2003: 
Chapter 7). The basic idea of the analysis, developed by Box and Jenkins (for 
a readable introduction, see Chatfield 1989), is to regress the current population 
density, N,, on lagged population densities N,_T, N,_2T, etc. where T is the time 
lag. I used the approach known as nonlinear time-series modeling (NLTSM), 
which approximates the relationship between current and lagged densities using 
a modified polynomial scheme (for details of the implementation, see Turchin 
2003). There are two structural parameters that also need to be estimated from 
the data: the number of lagged densities, d, and the polynomial degree, q. We are 
primarily interested in d, because it provides us with an estimate of the process 
order.

One question that has to be resolved in order for the analysis to proceed is, 
what value of the time lag, T, is appropriate? The series is sampled at 10-year 
intervals, but this was done simply for convenience. Above, I argued that the 
generation time for human populations should lie somewhere in the interval of 
20-30 years. To be safe, therefore, I used both lag values, T = 2 and 3 decades, 
and checked how this choice affects the results (and I repeat this procedure below, in the analysis of the long-term data on population dynamics in China). As 
Table 8.1 indicates, the results of the analysis with either choice of T are congruent. Both choices suggest a high signaVnoise ratio (R2 = 0.7-0.8) and rather 
unstable dynamics (A near 0). The evidence that the dynamical process is of 
second order (or higher) is very strong. It is noteworthy that, although different 
choices ofT result in different estimates of d, when we express the maximum 
process order in physical units ( Td), we obtain the same value, 60 years. To 
summarize, the analysis of this data series suggests a second-order, oscillatory 
population process, with a strong deterministic component, but rather low amplitude (at least, by the standards of nonhuman population dynamics; see Thrchin 
2003). These results appear to be robust with respect to various choices that we 
need to make in the process of the analysis. For example, I reanalyzed the data
