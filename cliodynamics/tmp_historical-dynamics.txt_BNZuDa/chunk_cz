French embarked on their most ambitious venture, the attempt to dominate Italy.

This adventure lead to the Valois-Habsburg wars of the sixteenth century and 
ultimately ended with the expulsion of the French from the Appenine Peninsula.

One possible explanation is that France overextended itself geopolitically; this 
seems very likely, but needs to be tested in a thorough and quantitative fashion.

For example, it would be very interesting to see how much it cost France to deliver 
armies to Rome or Naples, compared to the same task for Spain. The French had 
to travel overland, through mountain passes in the Alps. The Spanish, by contrast, 
shipped troops by sea, and it looks as if they had a geopolitical advantage. But 
this is just a qualitative argument, and a more quantitative approach is needed.

Note that the model of logistical loads is one theory that I have not been able to 
test directly (so far).

Whether because of logistical constraints, or for some other reason, the territorial expansion of France ceased by the mid-sixteenth century. The sixteenth 
century was also a period of sustained population growth in France, which was, 
as usual, reflected in the movement of food prices (Figure 9.3). Between 1460 
and 1560 the population of France doubled (Dupaquier et al. 1988b), reaching 
20 million, and then stagnated at that level to the end of the century (in fact, this 
level was not exceeded until the middle years of Louis XIV; Salmon 1976:32).

The elite numbers increased even faster. Thus, the total number of noble families 
in the election of Bayeux increased from 211 in 1463 to 559 in 1598 (Wood 
1980). At the other end of France, in Montpellier, the number of officeholders almost quadrupled from 112 in 1500 to 442 in 1600 (Greengrass 1985:122).

Thus, the demographic-structural machinery became engaged again, leading to increased fiscal distress, elite competition, political instability, and eventually state 
collapse.

The Bourbon Wave 
The period of political instability in France was about a century long, roughly 
1560-1660 c.E. There were two episodes of state collapse: the peak of the religious wars (around 1590) and the Fronde (around 1650). The first one resulted 
in a dynastic change from Valois to Bourbon. The authorities lost control of the 
capital both times, and internal warfare was extremely bloody, particularly in 
northern France.

'fhe period between the religious wars and the Fronde was relatively stable, with the exception of Louis XIII's minority. According to DupAquier et al.

(1988b:152), there were three periods of population decline: 1580-1597, 1626-
1631, and 1660-1663. These population crises were quite serious, especially the 
first and the last. The first crisis may have resulted in a population loss as high 
as 20% or more (Benedict 1985:96). During the last, certain provinces in the 
north and east probably lost close to a half of their inhabitants (Dupfu}uier et al.

1988b:152).

The end of the time of troubles, by mid-1660s, led to another bout of territorial 
expansion (Figure 9.1). Thus, we see that the French state experienced three 
major episodes of expansion: thirteenth century, fifteenth century, and the period 
of 1660-1710. In other words, the secular cycle had a direct effect on the ability 
of the state to expand. Note also that each successive wave of expansion was 
shorter and gained less territory. This trend can reflect either a declining asabiya 
or logistical constraints (or both).

The Bourbon cycle concluded with the French Revolution. The events leading 
to it are well known, and have been discussed by Goldstone from the point of 
view of the demographic-structural theory, so I will not review them here. I only 
note that the period of political instability extended from 1789 to 1848, and that 
during this time France experienced the Great Revolution, Bourbon restoration, 
a revolution in 1830, another one in 1848, and, finally, the establishment of the 
Second Empire. After that France embarked on another imperialistic expansionary 
period (although this time it did not do very well), but this quickly takes us 
beyond our self-imposed boundary of 1900 c.E.

A Digression on Synchrony 
One interesting aspect of the Bourbon wave was that France's period of instability 
was shifted in time with respect to the rest of western Europe. Thus, central 
Europe's period of instability was during the Thirty Years War (1618-1648).

England's was 1640 to 1690 (English Revolution, Stuart Restoration, and the 
Glorious Revolution). Spain's crisis years were during the 1640s: rebellions in 
Portugal, Catalonia, and southern Italy (although we should not forget about the 
Dutch revolt of the second half of the sixteenth century). Only Russia seems to 
be on the same trajectory as France (as will be seen in the next section).

This quick comparison raises a number of interesting issues. First, why did 
early modem state breakdown tend to occur in waves (Goldstone 1991b)? The 
crisis of the seventeenth century and the age of revolutions during the nineteenth century affected Europe, the Middle East (Ottoman Thrkey), and East Asia 
(China). Second, although there was a rough synchrony between different polities, 
it was not by any means perfect, as the fine structure of the "seventeenth-century 
crisis" shows. Additionally, although Russia was in synchrony with France during the seventeenth-century crisis, it subsequently shifted out of phase, since it 
experienced revolutions and state collapse in the early twentieth century, not in
