6. The tradition of California phenomenology includes works of Dagfinn
Føllesdal, Jaakko Hintikka, Hubert Dreyfus, Ronald McIntyre, Izchak Miller,
and the present author. Kindred work drawing on ontology includes that of
Dallas Willard, Barry Smith, Kevin Mulligan, and Peter Simons. The Cambridge
Companion to Husserl extends these literatures, including essays by J. N.
Mohanty, Kit Fine, Herman Philipse, and Richard Tieszen. Mohanty’s many
works on phenomenology are sympathetic to analytic philosophy of logic and
language, whereas philosopher-of-language Michael Dummett approaches
Husserl from Frege in the logical tradition. The writings of Aron Gurwitsch,
Lester Embree, Robert Sokolowski, John Drummond, and many others on
phenomenology do not tie directly to the analytic tradition, yet their results
in phenomenology are consonant on many points with results in California
phenomenology – as we should expect if we all turn to “the facts [Sachen]
themselves,” the facts of conscious experience.
