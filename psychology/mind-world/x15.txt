The Cogito circa a.d. 2000
Abstract. What are we to make of the cogito (cogito ergo sum) today, as the walls
of Cartesian philosophy crumble around us? The enduring foundation of
the cogito is consciousness. It is in virtue of a particular phenomenological
structure that an experience is conscious rather than unconscious. Drawing on an analysis of that structure, the cogito is given a new explication
that synthesizes phenomenological, epistemological, logical, and ontological elements. What, then, is the structure of conscious thinking on which
the cogito draws? What kind of certainty does the experience of thinking
give one about one’s thinking and about one’s existence? What form of
inference is the cogito, and what is the source of its validity and soundness?
Does the cogito itself lead to an ontology of mind and body like Descartes’s
dualism? The discussion begins with Descartes’s own careful formulations
of some of these issues. Then the cogito is parsed into several different principles, the phenomenological principle emerging as basic. In due course
the analysis sifts through Husserl’s epistemology, Hintikka’s logic (or pragmatics) of the cogito, and Kaplan’s logic of demonstratives, as these bear
specifically on the cogito.
Segue. In “Three Facets of Consciousness” we proposed that the nature of
any entity, including an act of consciousness, divides into form, appearance,
and substrate. Here we explore the form of consciousness – that of self-aware
intentionality – through its appearance within an act, that is, through “inner awareness.” We approach the analysis of inner awareness by a critical
review of the traditional “cogito,” drawing on Descartes’s analysis but from
today’s perspective (without dualism and without incorrigibility). The results provide one type of justification for first-person methodology in the
theory of mind. For phenomenology begins with our awareness of our
own intentional experiences as we experience them from our first-person
