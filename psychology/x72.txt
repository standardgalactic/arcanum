“grounding” of intentionality in context.

Intentionality Naturalized? 207
18. The relations between the intentionality of consciousness and the intensionality of sentences about intentional states are detailed in Smith and McIntyre
1982.
19. I have analyzed these structures in detail (1989: chap. 2).
20. The reasoning in Quine’s position is expressed in Pursuit of Truth (1992). See
my appraisal 1994. Quine’s thesis of the indeterminacy of translation was a
further reason Quine (1960) gave for renouncing a science of intention, and
thus phenomenology. I do not treat that problem here, although Quine’s
modified views (1991) lead, I think, to a different take on indeterminacy,
notably where empathy plays a role in understanding others.
21. See the References for relevant works of the authors cited. Compare Fodor
1994: 14–15, summarizing some current attitudes.
22. See Quine 1969.
23. On the controversies surrounding connectionism, see Horgan and Tienson
1991.
24. Philosophy of mind in cognitive science has centered on the issue of how
the mental might be reduced to the physical, focusing on what might be
the structure of causal or computational process that defines mind. The
structure of intentionality might then be preserved either as a language of
thought (“sentences in the head,” on Fodor’s earlier view) or as a flow of
physical “information” outside the head (Dretske’s view, partly adopted recently by Fodor). Or intentionality might be eliminated (as the Churchlands
have sometimes urged, assuming, mistakenly, that intentionality must have
the structure of sentences in the head). But there is a wide range of options
between these extremes, preserving some intentional structures and eliminating others. Moreover, the ontological issues are joined by questions about
the relations among our different levels of theory about mind and brain. The
complexity of these issues is brought out in Bickle 1992a, 1992b.
25. See Searle 1983, 1992.
26. See Quine and Ullian 1978 for the basic principles of framing knowledge in
general and scientific theory in particular. In Pursuit of Truth (1992) Quine
begins to make room for the intentional, but see my article (1994).
27. See my book (1989).
28. The new attitude is evident, for instance, in Crick 1994 and Churchland
1995.
29. See Flanagan 1992. The proclamation is a reviewer’s remark printed on the
back of the book. Flanagan’s discussion is indeed sensitive to a wide variety of
phenomenological issues about consciousness, and he explicitly says that “it
is incredible to think that we could do without phenomenology altogether”
(p. 12), proceeding to argue for how phenomenological claims should be
combined with empirical results of neuroscience. However, many issues of
phenomenological analysis of structures of consciousness are explored in
great depth and detail in the writings of Husserl, Heidegger, Sartre, MerleauPonty and many others in the phenomenological tradition. Good science
cannot pass over these results, any more than it can pass over significant
empirical experiments such as those of split-brain patients or blind-sight.
30. See Chalmers 1995, announcing his forthcoming book (1996).
208 Mind World
31. See D. W. Smith 1995.
32. Even if there are many metaphysically possible worlds, each is a unified
system: that is the point of unionism. And even if the “many-worlds” version
of quantum mechanics is true, the different parallel worlds are related in an
ordered way, and the “world” we find ourselves in has its unity: that is the
point here stressed by unionism. Unionism is thus orthogonal to the issue of
other possible worlds in modal ontology (actualism denies that view) and to
the issue of other parallel worlds of quantum mechanics. I would also argue
that unionism is orthogonal to the issue of nominalism (often construed as
ruling out abstract entities because they belong in a Platonic heaven apart
from the natural world); I return to this point later but only briefly.
33. See Searle 1992.
34. As a skeptic might have it: see Rey 1988.
35. The intentionality of a thought depends on a background of not only personal beliefs and skills, but also attitudes and ideas extant in one’s culture.
This conception of background is explored in my “The Background” in
Chapter 5. Compare Husserl’s notion of horizon in Ideas I and II, reconstructed in Smith and McIntyre 1982, and Searle’s notion of background
(1983, 1992).
36. The term “meme” was coined by Richard Dawkins and championed by
Dennett (1991).
37. A cognate ontology is that which underlies the PACIS computer system under
development by Ontek Corporation. That ontology is the collective work of
Charles W. Dement, Peter Simons, and myself. Parts of the ontology are previewed in Simons and Smith (with Charles W. Dement) 1993 and in Simons
1994–95, reflecting on a more recent version of our PACIS categories.
