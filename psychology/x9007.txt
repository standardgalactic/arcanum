Not only is Descartes beginning to observe the formal-material distinction in
ontology; he is also beginning to articulate a notion of modes as inseparably
dependent elements in proper substances. Both views emerged in full flower
in Husserl’s ontology, as we see later. Nelson’s reading of Descartes, as yet
unpublished, was presented in Paul Weingartner’s seminar on ontological
categories at the University of California, Irvine, in spring 2001.

to this analysis. The details make the case glossed here that intentionality
cannot be a proper relation, for reasons here assimilated to formal ontology.

And I called him Alexander and he answered just the same.
I put him in a match-box, and I kept him all the day...
And Nanny let my beetle out –
. . . And Beetle ran away.
.........
We went to all the places which a beetle might be near,
And we made the sort of noises which a beetle likes to hear,
And I saw a kind of something...
It was Alexander Beetle I’m as certain as can be
And he had a sort of look as if he thought it must be ME.
A. A. Milne, “Forgiven”
Now someone tells me that he knows what pain is only from his own case! –
Suppose everyone had a box with something in it: we call it a “beetle.” No
one can look into anyone else’s box, and everyone says he knows what a
beetle is only by looking at his beetle. – Here it would be quite possible for
everyone to have something different in his box. One might even imagine
such a thing constantly changing. – But suppose the word “beetle” had a
