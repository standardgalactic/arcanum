into our genetic cum cultural heritage or “collective unconscious” and
articulated in explicit cultural works.36 The Jungian archetypes, for instance of the masculine and feminine or of the “shadow”side of a person,
remind us just how contingent our world picture is. More recently, biologist Richard Dawkins has coined the term “meme” for cultural ideas
that evolve and are inherited socially in a pattern similar to the evolution
of physical traits. Daniel Dennett, in Consciousness Explained (1991), has
urged a role for such “memes” in the structure of consciousness, and I
would agree. But I would insist on a more robust account of consciousness than Dennett’s neo-Rylean “intentional stance” allows, and a more
articulate ontology of these entities, our background ideas.
In Sum, Ideas Rule
The world as we know it is built around the ground we stand on, literally,
as we walk and talk and live and breathe. That is a fact external to our
consciousness in walking, talking, thinking. Nonetheless, an idea of that
Background Ideas 169
fact – a “ground” proposition – is part of our background image of the
world. Not only does my walking depend ontologically on the ground’s
stability, but the intentionality of my volition in walking depends ontologically on the proposition that the “world” affords a stable ground on
which we walk. That proposition and related rules of practice belong to
the background of ideas or“groundrules” assumed in our culture, indeed,
in our species. And that background is a crucial part of the ontological
ground of our activities as members of Homo sapiens sapiens.
Notes
1. This theory of intentionality, discussed later, is developed, in reflection on
Husserl’s work, in Smith and McIntyre 1982.
2. See Searle 1983: chap. 5, 1992: chap. 8, and 1995: chap. 6; Wittgenstein
1972/1949–51; Husserl 1962/1913, 1989/1912, and 1970b/1954. All are
discussed here. See Dreyfus 1991, for an interpretation of Heidegger’s Being
and Time, stressing the role of background practices and skills in human
activity or “comportment” (Verhalten).
3. Husserl’s notion of founding (Fundierung), or dependence, was laid out in
the third of his Logical Investigations (1900–1), elaborating a conception originating in Aristotle. A version of this notion of dependence or foundation
is applied to background conditions that serve as grounds of intentionality,
specifically “direct” awareness, in D. W. Smith 1989: chap. 6.
The conception of formal ontology, distinguished from material ontology,
has roots in Aristotle and Leibniz. However, it seems to have been explicitly
developed first by Husserl, beginning in the third of his Logical Investigations
(1900–1) and given a sharp focus in the opening chapter of his Ideas I (1913).
Wittgenstein’s Tractactus Logico-Philosophicus (1921) can be read as detailing
a formal ontology: the world is composed of facts, that is, existing states of
affairs; these facts have certain forms (shared by the propositions that represent them); and the contents of these facts are objects and properties or
relations of various kinds that define, in Husserlian idiom, different “material” domains. Which domains Wittgenstein had in mind (sense data, physical
objects, etc.) is a notorious problem in interpreting the Tractatus – which just
shows that Wittgenstein had his hands on a formal ontology. Indeed, Husserl’s
formal ontology also recognized, independently of Wittgenstein and earlier,
the formal objects called states of affairs (Sachverhalten), which he called “categorial” objects “syntactically” formed. A recent study in formal ontology, in
Husserl’s sense, is Johansson 1989.
4. Wittgenstein 1972/1949–51.
5. I shall not have room to deal here with Heidegger’s “ground concepts,”
which I see as forming a “deep background” of intentionality. See Heidegger
1993/1941. Compare Heidegger 1969/1929 and also 1991/1957. The
German word Grund is translated sometimes as “ground” and sometimes as
“reason.” Heidegger himself appraised the different meanings of the word,
shifting from the epistemological to the ontological notion of “ground.”
170 Mind World
6. Husserl’s notion of the “life world” (Lebenswelt) is central in The Crisis of
European Sciences and Transcendental Phenomenology (1970b/1954/1935–38).
Closer detail is found in his account of the “spiritual world” (geistigen Welt),
also called the “human” (menschlich) or “personalistic” world, in Ideas II
(1989/1912). Husserl’s conception of the human world was a precursor
to Heidegger’s notion of “world” as in human “being-in-the-world.”
7. See Ingarden 1989/1961 and 1964. A recent study of the ontology of fictional entities, revising and improving upon Ingardenian principles, is in
Thomasson 1998.
8. See Føllesdal 1982/1969; Smith and McIntyre 1982; Dreyfus 1982; and
Searle 1983.
9. Searle originally distinguished the Network of background beliefs from the
Background of practical capacities; see Intentionality (1983), chap. 5. In The
Rediscovery of the Mind (1992), chap. 8, he argues that the Network is a special part of the Background, collapsing unconscious beliefs, and hence the
Network, into neural dispositions in the Background. In The Construction of
Social Reality (1995), chapter 6, Searle again defines the Background as preintentional neural capacities. Husserl’s notion of horizon is reconstructed in
Smith and McIntyre 1982: chap. 5. See chap. 5, sec. 3, on the role of background beliefs, ranging from general beliefs (say, about birds) to fundamental ontological beliefs (say, about material objects) to concrete beliefs about a
particular individual. Husserl defined the horizon of an act in different ways,
none of which coincides with the definition of either network or background
as discussed here but which lead in clear ways into the issues of network and
background. Husserl defined the horizon of an act as the range of possibilities left open by the content of the act. These possibilities are empirically
“motivated”; they are constrained not only by the explicit content of the act
but also by the “implicit” content, that is, the content of relevant background
beliefs.
10. This kind of presupposition, taken as precondition or“ground” of intentionality, is analyzed in D. W. Smith 1989: chap. 6. The kindred notion of logical
presupposition, a special form of dependence in Husserl’s sense, is noted in
Simons 1987: 290ff.
11. Wittgenstein 1972/1949–51: 1ff. 94–96, 136, 151ff., 202ff., 308–9, 401, 411.
Discussion of the key points follows.
12. See Searle 1995: 139–47.
13. Searle 1983 separates the Network (beliefs) from the Background (skills),
where Searle 1992 incorporates the Network into the Background, where
both background “beliefs” and background skills are built into the nervous
system.
14. See Searle 1992: 177.
15. In Intentionality (1983) and again in The Rediscovery of the Mind (1992), Searle
argues for the Background partly by analogy with issues of linguistic meaning
and metaphor. Here I want to stay close to the problem of intentionality itself.
Indeed, the most persuasive argument for the hypothesis of the background
is a detailed description of simple cases of intentionality, along lines charted
by Searle in both books.
Background Ideas 171
16. Compare Dreyfus 1991. I think that Dreyfus is right in cautioning against
putting too much intentional content in very basic forms of experience but
wrong in two ways. First, he sometimes seems to identify intentionality itself,
or the very relation of subject to object, with too much content. Second, he
gives too big a role to skills or“coping” because he does not have a variegated
notion of background.
