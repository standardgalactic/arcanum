And, of course, there are more variations on the forms realized in states of
consciousness. These cases, however, begin to lay out the variety of forms

of consciousness, inner awareness, and retention that may be involved in
perception.
In short, given the variety of structures we have found in different forms
and levels of consciousness, we can begin to systematize the differences
among the many cases that motivated different – and falsely competing –
views about consciousness, its form, and its prevalence. We have, in other
words, begun the systematics of consciousness.35
Notes
1. Descartes’s view is expressed in the Sixth Replies: in the translation by
Cottingham, Stoothoff, and Murdoch 1988: vol. 2. Descartes’s Latin
“cognitione interna” is translated by Cottingham et al. as “inner awareness” –
a leap of interpretation. Remember that Descartes uses cognitio, or “thought,”
as a general term for all mental acts. When I wrote “The Structure of
(Self-)Consciousness” (1986), I chose the term of art“inner awareness,” which
I later found in the Cottingham et al. translations and addressed in “The
Cogito circa ad 2000” (1993; Chapter 1 in this volume). Although the translation is somewhat anachronistic, Descartes’s argument is thoroughly contemporary with today’s debate about higher-order thought making a mental state
conscious – a view discussed here. My thanks to Alan Nelson for assistance on
this point of translation and interpretation.
2. Leibniz 1998/1714: 260.
3. Leibniz 1998/1714: 260, opening the same paragraph from which the preceding quotation is drawn.
4. Suppose a “monad” is a complex form of mental activity supervenient on
or rather implemented in a physical system along the lines of contemporary
functionalism. Then read Leibniz 1998/1714: 37ff. on “homuncular functionalism” and the later discussion in Lycan 1987, followed by Lycan, “Consciousness as Internal Monitoring,” in Block et al. 1997. Recall that Leibniz,
the great visionary of formal thinking according to Husserl, was probably the
first thinker to envision explicitly what we today call a computing machine.
5. A complementary anthology addressing philosophy of mind more broadly
is forthcoming: Phenomenology and Philosophy of Mind, edited by the present
author and Amie L. Thomasson.
6. Siewert (1998) argues at length from the case of blindsight for the need
to recognize and not neglect the phenomenal features of consciousness in
vision (see chaps. 3–5). I follow the same basic line of argument initially (do
see Siewert’s detailed discussion). However, Siewert argues “against ways of
identifying consciousness with a kind of mentally self-reflexive feature” (197,
see chap. 6 for details, noting 197). I concur that what defines consciousness is
no form of higher-order thought or perception directed toward the conscious
state (so noted in my 1986 and 1989: chap. 2). But I go on to seek an analysis of
inner awareness that avoids those problems. Here I restrict inner awareness,
though, to certain forms of consciousness. Stay tuned.

7. See the account of blindsight in Martha J. Farah, “Visual Perception and
Visual Awareness after Brain Damage: A Tutorial Overview,” in Block et al.
1997.
8. Siewert (1998: chap. 3) distinguishes a variety of cases of sight including
full sight, amblyopic (partially atrophied) sight, empirically observed limited
blindsight, and idealized full blindsight (as good as normal conscious vision).
9. See Smith 2002a.
10. Empathy is precisely projecting oneself from one’s own first-person perspective into another’s position as subject, comprehending the other’s experience as if one’s own. See Smith 1989: chap. 3.
11. Dennett (1991) introduced the useful term “heterophenomenology,” albeit
with the ulterior motive of gutting the concept of consciousness and undermining “autophenomenology,” or phenomenology as I am practicing it.
12. See Freud 1965/1933.
13. The relations among forms of experience and forms of language are discussed at length in Smith and McIntyre 1982. The principles behind this
method of phenomenological analysis are detailed there and carried over
into Smith 1989, and into the present discussion.
14. See Smith 2002b.
15. As Brentano’s students went to work on intentionality, two approaches
developed: the “object” and the “content” approaches to intentionality, as
appraised in Smith and McIntyre 1982. Meinong championed the object
approach, while Husserl championed the content approach. On the object approach, all distinctions in intentionality are distinctions in the object
“intended.” On the content approach, there are distinctions in content as
opposed to object, where the content defines or reflects the way the object
is intended. Thus Husserl characterized the ideal content or sense (Sinn) of
an act as “the object as intended.”
16. Indexical intentionality is a complex story. See Smith 1989.
17. That perception is a form of indexical awareness, perhaps the paradigm
form, is discussed at length in Smith 1989: chap. 1, and observed in Smith
and McIntyre 1982: chap. 7.
18. This approach already has difficulties with intentionality: see Smith 1999.
Different issues are raised here.
19. To be true to Brentano (1995/1874), we should note that for Brentano
judgment is not necessarily of a subject-predicate form (142), as we here
assume in line with today’s logic. For Brentano “judgment” is an affirmation
or denial (of existence), rather than a judgment that such and such is the
case.
20. For the present interpretation, see Smith and McIntyre 1982: chap. 3, and
(more briefly) McIntyre and Smith 1989. In Husserl, Logical Investigations
(1970/1900–1), the distinction is drawn between the “quality” and “matter”
of an act; in Husserl, Ideas I (1963/1913), the distinction is drawn between
the “thetic character” and “Sinn” within the noema of an act.
21. In Searle 1983.
22. This tendency Siewert calls “the ‘consciousness-of’ trap” (1998: 194).
23. Compare Perry’s recent account of “reflexive content” (2001: chap. 6).

24. For an illuminating discussion of the origin of the text (compiled in 1917
by Edith Stein from Husserl’s lecture notes, then edited in 1928 with little
change by Martin Heidegger), and an overview of Husserl’s analysis and the
difficulties of interpreting Husserl’s evolving account of the “constitution”
of time consciousness, see Brough’s Translator’s Introduction to Husserl
(1991/1893–1917). A careful and succinct reconstruction of Husserl’s analysis of time consciousness is that in Miller 1984.
25. Husserl’s concept of “constitution” is central to his doctrine of “transcendental idealism,” my take on which is elaborated in Smith 1995: 372ff.
26. A rich phenomenological study of related issues is that in Zahavi 1999. Zahavi
carefully distinguishes aspects of the structure of self-awareness, including
inner awareness and temporality.
27. The modal interpretation of “consciously” is a specific approach to the logic
of the adverb “consciously.” If the clause “I see this frog,” or “I see that this
is a frog,” has a relational predicative form, the intentional verb “see” being
a transitive verb (as Rosenthal and Dretske assumed), then “consciously”
in the sentence “Consciously I see this frog” seems to take an adverbial
