form, modifying the verb “see.” By grammatical analogy, the character of
consciousness might be called an adverbial character, as Amie Thomasson
(2000) has observed in addressing Brentano. I think that is correct, and that
is the first principle to extract from Brentano. Thomasson contrasts such
adverbial analyses (including mine) with models of higher-order thought or
perception.
28. The details here were laid out in Smith 1989.
29. The interdependence of the various indexical contents – “this [object],”
“here,” “now,” “I,” “this very experience” – is studied at length in Smith
1989.
30. Searle (1992) holds that all mental states are conscious and that what some
have called unconscious intentional states are really neural dispositions to
produce conscious mental activities. Although I do not here directly address
Searle’s view, the delineation of levels of consciousness cuts against the sharp
line Searle draws between conscious states and nonmental neural states.
31. The following scheme of four levels, and three biases, was drafted in my
discussions with Chuck Dement around 1993. We were seeking a formal
system of intentionality that would be framed ultimately by a formal ontology
along the lines sketched in my essay “Being and Basis” (1997). A specific aim
of the scheme was to place indexical modes of awareness in a larger formal
phenomenology, assuming an account of indexical awareness like that in my
book The Circle of Acquaintance (1989).
32. Johannes Brandl has made a similar point, in conversation and in a colloquium on reduction and levels of intentionality presented in spring 1999 at
the University of California, Irvine.
33. See Smith 1989: chap. 1.
34. Searle (1983) characterizes “direction of fit” as one distinguishing feature
of intentionality. For Searle, in thought or perception the direction of fit
is from mind to world, as a state of thinking or perceiving fits the state of
the world if the thought or perception is true; but in intention or action the
120 Mind World
direction of fit is from world to mind, as a state of the world fits the intention
in or behind an action if the intention is satisfied. The present conception of
“bias” is somewhat like the notion of direction-of-fit, but distinguishes three
forms of orientation or direction, separating thinking from perceiving and
both from intention or volition in action. (I use the term “volition” where
Searle uses “intention in action.”) In D. W. Smith (1997) bias is cast as a basic
mode of being: an entity is either receptive or static or active. Accordingly,
in particular, a mental state is either receptive as in perception, or static with
respect to environment as in thinking, or active as in volition cum action.
35. Systematics in biology is the science of the diversity of life forms. Here
I use the term in an extended sense. Compare my “Basic Categories” in
Chapter 8.
