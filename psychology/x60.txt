17. This is a variation on an example recounted by Searle 1992: 184–85. In
Searle’s example a famous European philosopher was walking with Searle
on the Berkeley campus, discussing the notion of background, when an
earthquake struck. The visitor realized after the quake that before then he
had not held a belief that the earth does not move; he had simply taken this
for granted. This convinced him of the hypothesis of the background.
Assume that walking is an action, a complex event or process that includes as a proper part a volition (an intentional state or event) with a certain content that represents my bodily movement in walking. An account
of this structure of action, informed by a content theory of intentionality,
is detailed in my “Consciousness in Action” (1992). My account there is
consonant in many respects with Searle’s account of action in chapter 3 of
Intentionality (1983); the differences are that I assume a more pointed version of the content theory of intentionality and I detail the phenomenology
of the background states of perception and kinesthesis typically associated
with the volition (for Searle, intention-in-action) constituent in an action.
18. A conscious experience of action involves a variety of interrelated experiences, including volition, kinesthesis, and perception. These may presuppose beliefs with various contents. Such beliefs, however, are not occurrent events of consciousness but “background” attitudes, which on some
analyses are dispositions to have occurrent conscious thoughts. On the
phenomenological or intentional structure of action, see D. W. Smith
1992.

21. Wittgenstein used the term Weltbild as early as in the Tractatus, his first work,
as well as in On Certainty, his last work. He borrowed the term from Heinrich
Hertz’s Principles of Mechanics (1894), which urged that science owes
us a “law-conforming world picture” (gesetzmassig Weltbild ¨ ). I am indebted to
Joseph Tougas’s study of Wittgenstein’s use of ideas from Hertz, “Hertz und
Wittgenstein” (1996).
22. On the limits of representation, see Hintikka and Hintikka 1986 and Kusch
1989. The Hintikkas argue that, for Wittgenstein (early and late), language
cannot contain its own semantics, cannot represent its own form, which is
a ground or enabling condition. In the Tractarian scheme, as I should like
to put it, form is part of the background, and ground, of representation in
language, even if it can be represented in a limited range of language called
logic, or in a separate metalanguage. Kusch develops these themes in the
systems of Husserl, Heidegger, and Gadamer.
23. See Husserl 1989/1912 and 1970b/1954. See Føllesdal 1990. Much of the
detail of the account to follow draws on D. W. Smith 1995.

25. See D. W. Smith 1995. These distinctions are detailed, in diffuse discussion,
in Husserl 1989/1912. Husserl began using the term “life world” (Lebenswelt)
around 1917, borrowed from Georg Simmel. In Ideas II he called the essence
of the life world either Spirit (Geist) or Human (Mensch).
26. This structure is reconstructed in D. W. Smith 1995, drawing out ideas in
Husserl’s Ideas II (1912).
27. See Kim 1993, especially the conceptual survey of different notions of supervenience in the essay “Supervenience as a Philosophical Concept.” Kim
discusses different conceptions of supervenience, only some of which involve
dependence.
28. On kinesthesis, empathy, and value in Husserl’s scheme, see D. W. Smith
1995. A detailed discussion of Husserl’s analysis of our commonsense ontology, and also physics, is found in Barry Smith 1995.
29. This conception of horizon is reconstructed, and related to recent possibleworlds theory, in Smith and McIntyre 1982: chap. 5.
30. Husserl’s notion of founding (Fundierung), or dependence, was used in many
later works after being developed in the third of his Logical Investigations
(1900–1), elaborating a conception originating in Aristotle and used by
Brentano. The Husserlian analysis is assayed in Barry Smith 1982. A wider
discussion of ontological dependence, amplifying Husserl’s conception, is
found in Simons 1987: chap. 8, pp. 290ff. Fine (1995) explores an alternative, nonmodal conception of dependence. Thomasson (1998) develops a
succinct model of a basically Husserlian conception of dependence, refining distinctions formulated by Roman Ingarden and applying the model to
fictional objects as dependent on authors’ and readers’ intentional acts. Another recent discussion is Lowe 1994. D. W. Smith (1989: chap. 6) sketches a
ramified notion of dependence or ground, specifying different kinds of dependence (physical, psychological, etc.) and distinguishing kinds of dependence involved in direct awareness, or acquaintance, notably dependence
on intentional content and different kinds of dependence on the context
of one’s experience. Simons (cited earlier) similarly distinguished different
kinds of ontological dependence, including logical presupposition.
31. Barwise and Perry (1983: chap. 5) construct a logic of reports of perception
and other attitudes, using a notion of “constraints” on meaning and other
phenomena. There are some affinities between that notion of constraint
and the notion of “background” under discussion here, but that is a topic
for another day, as we are not here concerned with the logic or semantics of
reports of intentional attitudes.
32. See Kim 1993, especially the essay “Supervenience as a Philosophical
Concept.”
33. See Burge 1979, 1982. Such externalism is critiqued in D. W. Smith 1991.

35. The different roles of context and content are vivid in perception. There is
normally a causal relation between the object perceived and the perceptual
experience, but there is also an intentional relation between them, mediated
by the content of the experience. The content prescribes the object as before
Background Ideas 173
the subject and causing the experience. But the intentional relation is distinct
from the causal relation: intentionality does not reduce to causal relatedness.
This line of argument is detailed in D. W. Smith 1989.

1935, are collected in The Basic Writings of C. G. Jung (1990).
