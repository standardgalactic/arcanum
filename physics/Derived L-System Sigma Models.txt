Abstract
We construct a derived sigma model (DLSSM) unifying L-system
rewriting, Batalin-Vilkovisky quantization, and ethical gradient flows.
The action functional incorporates a derived sheaf of rewriting rules
over plenum tiling stacks and introduces ethical potentials as defor-
mations of BRST cohomology. We establish consistency via the clas-
sical master equation, interpret moral trajectories through weighted
∞-groupoids, and propose simulation protocols using persistent ho-
mology. The framework reinterprets RSVP phenomena as emergent
properties, offering insights into recursive programming, AI ethics,
and derived field theories.

Introduction
The universe's evolution challenges unified theories. RSVP posits a plenum
undergoing internal differentiation, reinterpreting gravity as an entropy gra-
dient and cosmic evolution as smoothing. L-systems model recursive self-
assembly, while ethical computation seeks normative guidance. This paper
constructs a Derived L-System Sigma Model (DLSSM), unifying these ideas
via a field-theoretic framework. We show RSVP dynamics—entropy flows,
gravity, and smoothing—emerge from DLSSM's geometric and ethical struc-
tures.

Geometric Foundations
2.1
Plenum Geometry and Tiling Stacks
Let Ptile be a derived stack of L-system tilings.
• Gray-Coded L-Words.
Local models are L-words w ∈Σ∗with
Gray-code properties, forming a category G with morphisms as minimal
rewrites.
• Persistent Wasserstein Gluing. Patches are glued via Wasserstein
isometries between persistence diagrams, ensuring global consistency.
• Hilbert Curve Embedding. A map ι : H ,→Ptile embeds L-system
sequences into a fractal geometry.
2.2
Rewriting Bundles as Sheaves
The rewriting rules form a derived sheaf Lrewrite on Ptile, with sections:
Lrewrite(U) = Hent
G (−, R(−))

mapping to ∞-Cat, weighted by entropic cost.
[BV Invariance] Stackification of Lrewrite preserves BV invariance.
Proof Sketch. Stackification ensures local gauge symmetries propagate glob-
ally, with Wasserstein gluing compatible with BV equivalence.

DLSSM Action and BV Quantization
3.1
Action Functional
The action on a derived manifold M is:
SDLSSM =
∫
T[1]M
⟨Φ∗(θ), dΦ⟩+ λ
∫
M
Φ∗(Lrewrite) + γ
∫
∂M
ϵ(Φ)
• Kinetic Term: Encodes field dynamics, e.g., Jµ∂µS.
• Rewriting Term: Couples Φ to Lrewrite, driving recursive smoothing.
• Ethical Term: ϵ(Φ) guides evolution via boundary conditions.
3.2
Anomaly Analysis
The classical master equation {SDLSSM, SDLSSM}BV = 0 holds if:
1. Kinetic and rewriting terms satisfy AKSZ conditions.
2. ϵ(Φ) is a cocycle: (dBRSTϵ)(Φ) = 0.

Connection to RSVP
4.1
RSVP Emergence
• Fields S, Jµ. S is entropy density, Jµ is flow, with dynamics from the
kinetic term.
• Gravity as Flow. ϵ(Φ) induces flows mimicking gravity via entropy
gradients.
• Smoothing. Lrewrite drives entropy diffusion, aligning with RSVP's
void expansion.

4.2
Cosmic Cycles
• Freeze State. Zero gradients occur at Lrewrite fixed points and ϵ(Φ)
extrema.
• Reset. Perturbations in ϵ(Φ) trigger bifurcations, seeding new struc-
ture via L-system axioms.

Ethical Homotopy Theory
We define moral trajectories as paths in a weighted ∞-groupoid, with ϵ(Φ)
as a homotopy invariant guiding ethical evolution.
