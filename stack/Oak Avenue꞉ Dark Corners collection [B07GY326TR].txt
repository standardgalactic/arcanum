1. The Find
So, how much?
I shift fifteen-month-old Sabrina on my hip to shield her from the blazing afternoon sun.
Her cheeks are pink with the July heat, and while she must be uncomfortably hot,
she contentedly slurps on her cup of organic apple juice and rests her beautiful head on my shoulder.
2. Well, Bill the Tree Man, I assume not his given name, wipes the back of his neck with a red handkerchief.
Nearly every tree in your boundary needs something.
That's what I gathered.
If you want to have the work done, tell Eddie to give me a call.
Eddie, I've never referred to my husband by this particular diminutive.
But in the weeks since we moved back to his hometown, I've learned that's how most people know him.
The tree surgeon shoves a worn business card at me.
It looks as if it's been in the back pocket of his jeans through at least one wash cycle.
I take it, although I know how to get a hold of him.
My in-laws gave me his name and number, and anyone in town would have done the same.
You want a tree taken down?
You call Bill.
He's been here in Parker's Landing nearly as long as some of the trees he fells.
Good to have the kid back in the neighborhood, Bill says.
When did you marry him?
It'll be three years, this September.
Well, congratulations.
Nice to meet you, Eddie's wife.
Anastasia.
I tell him for the third time.
Yeah.
He turns toward his truck, which is rusting at the right rear fender.
A hand-painted, Bill's tree service spans the side of the bed.
I look forward to getting started.
Mr.
I check the card, but there's no last name listed.
Bill?
Wait.
He glances at me over his shoulder.
My husband's career has him in New York every Monday morning through Thursday evening, and
if you're waiting for Eddie to come home to make a decision, you could be waiting a long
time.
With all due respect, if you want the job, you're going to have to deal with me.
All right.
His shoulders drop with his drawn-out sigh.
Take me through the property again.
I'll pay attention this time.
I bite my tongue before a, you've gotta be kidding me, slips out.
If I were anywhere else, in any other town, I might have told the guy to get lost.
But it took the entire week to schedule an appointment, and no other services come out
this far.
Believe me, I tried.
So, I keep my thoughts to myself, walk the property again, and at the end of the second
round, Bill, the tree man, says,
Have Eddie call.
We'll talk numbers.
Really?
But I don't have any more time to waste arguing.
Sabrina's hungry.
The oven has been preheating for nearly half an hour, and it's so damn hot.
Brave woman, Bill says, as he climbs into his truck.
Moving into this house?
Why's that?
He thumbs toward the house a couple of acres away, where my husband's parents reside.
Mother-in-law factor.
Oh, yes, there's that.
You gonna take down that carriage house?
I'm a restoration specialist.
At least, I used to be.
I peek at the structure behind me, which boasts a hayloft and cedar-lined room on the
second level, and on the first, a pony stall and carriage stops beneath inches of mud
accumulated over the years.
The roof sags.
The foundation is sinking, and the siding is rotting from the ground up.
I'd like to restore it.
He chuckles and shakes his head, as if he can't believe I'd be so stupid as to entertain such
a thought.
Good luck.
Clouds of dust rise beneath his tires as he drives away.
Mama?
Sabrina hands over her empty juice cup.
Yes, baby girl.
I'll get you something to eat.
I climbed three splintered wooden steps to the door of the late 1800s Victorian, which Edison
and I had purchased, without my ever seeing more than a photograph of the outside, a few
weeks ago.
He'd dreamed of living in this place since he was a little boy, but the Churchill estate
still owned it and had refused to sell it for years, despite its vacancy.
Needless to say, when the house finally came on the market, my husband placed a call and
offered more than the asking price.
We packed up and moved from Chicago to this eerily quiet little town on the southern tip
of Illinois, where he'd grown up, where his family had rooted generations ago.
Close to my folks, he'd said.
They'll help with the baby when I'm on the project in New York.
It promised I'd love the town and its people.
And while I'm certain his parents still aren't crazy about me, the stranger who'd hijacked
their son and eloped with him to St. Croix a month into our relationship, he insists living
here is a good way to hit the restart button.
Even without the prospect of help with Sabrina, and thus, time to myself, the thought of living
in an enormous historical home enchanted me.
I envisioned polishing old woodwork to its former glory and finding ancient trunks in attics and
secret rooms or passageways behind old Wainscot.
Even approaching the house, I was giddy with excitement to see the wraparound porch, steel
gables, and turret.
Imagine my surprise when we opened the doors to shag carpeting and dark laminate paneling,
neither of which had been in vogue since the disco age, and bicentennial wallpaper, complete
with stars and stripes and bald eagles on shields.
The only Wainscot came in the form of the shag carpeting stapled to the walls in the upstairs
hallway.
And the only hidden anything I'd found was a store of dusty wine bottles and beer cans in
one of the crawl spaces.
Ugly?
Doesn't begin to describe the interior of the house.
Not a square inch of Victorian charm had survived the 1976 renovation.
I hate it.
But it's fixable.
In a few years, when we have some money saved, we'll tear into it and give this house the justice
it deserves.
It'll be beautiful then.
We'll raise our family on this rare three-acre plot of land, just outside this quaint town
where everyone knows my name, Eddie's wife, or to the more traditional neighbor, Mrs. Clementine.
Across the room, Sabrina laughs in her high chair.
What's so funny?
I ask.
She eats a Cheerio.
I gave her a cup of cereal to tide her over until the oven timer buzzes, and says,
Zo.
This is a new one.
Every day she explores new sounds.
I suspect it'll be a few days before I know what Zo means.
I turn on a kid show to occupy her and get to work.
I try to unpack three boxes a day, but the task seems never-ending.
Being a mom of a baby under the age of two means my days are broken into 15-minute increments.
Besides, there's no storage in the kitchen, which makes settling in nearly impossible.
I've stacked pots and pans in a corner on the countertop because I refuse to hang them
on the pegboard wall.
That's right.
Pegboard.
In the kitchen.
My daughter lets out a belly laugh.
Zo, zo, zo, zo, zo.
The next morning, I stir with the rumblings of heavy machinery out on the lawn.
Sabrina, who hasn't slept in her crib since the day we moved in, yawns next to me.
Mama?
Morning, pumpkin.
I gather her into my arms, rise from the mattress, and walk over to the window to see what the
ruckus is.
What the?
Bill's tree service trucks line my drive.
Bill himself is in the middle of the side lot, barking orders, pointing this way and that.
Good morning, ma'am.
I gasp when I see a man tethered in ropes, sitting in the tree just outside my window.
He grins and offers a wave.
I throw closed the ugly green and blue brocade draperies.
Let's call daddy.
Edison answers on the fourth ring.
Good morning, my love.
I warm with the sound of his voice.
Hi, Eddie?
Eddie?
He chuckles.
Since when do you call me Eddie?
Just trying to be one of the crowd here.
Well, from the sound of it, you're doing just fine.
How's the baby?
Wonderful, as always.
She misses her daddy.
Her daddy misses her.
She's got a new word.
Zoe.
She's been saying it since yesterday afternoon.
I don't know what that means, he says, laughing.
But I hate missing all these things.
In a few weeks, I'll be able to take some time off, and we can do something fun together.
Just the three of us.
That would be nice.
And, Anna?
I miss the hell out of you too, babe.
Miss you more.
Listen, I have to call you back.
I'm heading into a meeting.
Just a second.
Did you speak with the tree man, by any chance?
I thought you were handling that.
I tried.
Twice.
But remember, he wanted to talk to you.
I detailed the annoying meeting during last night's conversation.
Well, he's here.
Overtaking the lawn.
What's it going to cost?
I don't know.
That's why I'm calling.
I just woke up.
Just now?
It's nearly eight there.
I ignore the dig and the implication it carries, that I'm eating bonbons while he's earning
a living.
Or maybe I'm just stressed and making a big deal out of nothing.
They're already working.
They're already digging at the roots of that old catalpa.
It doesn't work that way.
Go find out what he's going to charge before we end up with a bill we can't pay.
I don't have to remind you that things will be tight for a few months.
Because we paid too much for this money pit.
I've already tried twice to get a number out of him, I say.
He won't give me an estimate.
Why not?
Who knows?
Because I'm a woman?
Because I didn't grow up in this town?
Anastasia.
He sighs.
We knew moving from the city was going to be an adjustment.
Give it time.
You'll meet people, other moms.
You'll have friends.
People will like you.
That's not what I'm getting at.
Can you handle this, please?
I'll give it another shot.
No sooner had I hung up, managed to get Sabrina changed and my teeth brushed,
than the doorbell is ringing.
Quickly, after tossing on a sundress, I hike the baby higher on my hip and begin down the hallway.
Just near the stairs is a door that leads to steps up to the attic.
Being a six-panel oak door, stained and orangish-yellow in true testament to the 1970s,
it obviously isn't original to the structure.
It's always slightly ajar, as it appears a hair too wide for its frame.
But this morning, it's wide open.
My breath catches in my throat with the sight of it.
How could a door that needs coercion to move even an inch have swung open on its own?
Perhaps the vibration of all the machinery outside had something to do with it.
After giving it another shove, it begrudgingly scrapes its way into position.
I head down the stairs to answer the doorbell, which is ringing again.
There stands Bill, already sweating, already dirty.
When I open the door, he offers a handwritten contract.
I glance at the bottom line.
Seventy-three hundred and change.
Wow.
We may have to do the work in installments.
Trees gotta come down before they fall.
This one here's rotten at the core.
He thumbs over his shoulder at a nearby pear tree.
Get it?
It's a fruit tree, rotten at the core.
Yes, funny.
And I understand.
But Edison and I...
I do the work.
Eddie pays me when he pays me.
It's gotta be done.
Okay.
I'll just give Ed a call and...
You got a minute?
We found something I think you ought to see.
I follow him out to the yard, to the roots of the Catalpa.
There, embedded in the soil, a couple of feet beneath the surface, is a door.
We're digging it out by hand, Bill says.
A shock we didn't split it when we drove the backhoe over it.
What's it doing there?
Who knows?
Or as I can tell, it's intact.
It's beautiful, I managed to say.
But beautiful can't begin to describe it.
Mesmerizing is more like it.
Especially because you don't expect to see this sort of thing buried in the ground.
It has exactly the type of Victorian detailing I'd hoped to find inside this place.
Three men scrape their shovels against the door, which boasts four horizontal recessed panels, each trimmed with applied molding.
And at the top, in the space where a fifth panel might be, is an ornate iron grate.
Its pattern matches the one original heat register in the house, in the nursery.
What do you want us to do with it?
Bill asks.
Strange that it's not rotted, one of the men says.
Being in the dirt so long.
How long's it been here?
I ask.
Probably tossed out with the last rehauling of the house, Bill says.
Maybe missed the dumpster.
And with all the dirt moving around for the back addition in 76, got covered up.
If it's salvageable, I begin.
It's preserved, Bill says.
Strangest thing.
Could you bring it to the back patio so I can clean it up?
I'd love to use it in the renovation.
He chuckles.
It'll be a lot of work.
You'll have to treat it like reclaimed wood.
Spray it with pesticides, scrape off all the paint, which probably has lead in it.
And you have a child to think about.
I don't mind hard work.
I straighten.
I'll be right back.
I'd like to measure it.
I got it.
One of the laborers stretches a tape measure over it.
34 and 7 eighths by...
He adjusts the tape measure.
81 and a quarter.
Odd size.
Most doors are about three quarters of an inch shorter.
Wonder if it'll fit anywhere.
I'll trim it if I have to.
I want this door in my house.
I want the place to look as grand as it once did.
I want this move to no man's land to be worth it.
Okay then, Bill says.
If that's what you want.
Maybe you want to call your husband to be sure.
I'm sure my husband would agree.
Before he can do his damnedest to make me feel like a fool, I go back inside, where the old air conditioner, the one element of the bicentennial renovation I don't mind, even if it is on its last legs, sputters to life.
I clip up my hair, feed my baby, begin unpacking another box.
But I can't stop thinking about the door.
Why would anyone have tossed out such a gorgeous architectural piece, only to replace it with something ordinary?
And if Bill's theory is correct, and it really was meant to land in a dumpster, who would have left it on the ground to be covered by over 40 years of Earth?
The hum of the machinery outside rattles this old place.
I feel the grind of the gears in my teeth, in my bones.
And when Sabrina and I go upstairs to dress for a walk to the park, the attic door stands open, as if I'd never negotiated it closed.
Wood swells with summer heat, I know this, and perhaps the cooling system has caused the door to shrink back and glide open.
It's a better explanation than those skipping through my mind, that I'm losing it, and never closed the door to begin with.
Or that there's something living in the attic that doesn't pay rent, a squirrel or raccoon or, heaven forbid, a rat, pushing against it from the other side.
I shove the door closed again, and with great effort, it finally pops back into place.
The latch doesn't catch, because it doesn't line up.
All the years of settling haven't been kind.
But I lean into the door and, once it's closed, give it a tug to test it.
It won't budge.
That ought to do it, I say aloud.
This time, however, I notice something as I'm walking away.
The ugly attic access door is shorter than its frame, by about three-quarters of an inch.
Two.
The Whisper.
It's nearly midnight, but I can't sleep.
So I'm reading in the hallway, so as not to wake Sabrina by keeping a light on.
They say the key to getting enough rest when your kids are young is to sleep when they do.
But I can't rein in my thoughts tonight.
Even the book in my hands can't pull my attention from the state of this house.
I imagine what this place will look like when I'm finished with it.
Once the door is in place at the foot of the attic stairs.
Once these cheap metal registers are replaced with replicas of the original iron grates.
Once the walls are painted and the carpeting is hauled off the property in a dumpster.
There's nothing I can do about the probably asbestos-ridden drop ceiling in the dining room
or the god-awful, dysfunctional kitchen until we manage to build our savings back up.
But that doesn't mean I have to live with this gaudy decor forever.
Elbow grease and my time won't cost anything.
I can get this place looking nicer than it does, and the sooner, the better.
I peek into the master bedroom, find Sabrina still fast asleep, and decide,
why not get started?
I'll feel better about being here if the place feels more like home.
I curl up a corner of the orange and yellow shag in the upstairs hallway
and find a gorgeous cherry parquet floor beneath it.
Even if the floor is in desperate need of refinishing, which is likely,
it'll look better than this ugly carpet.
It's too late to start a project tonight, but I can't help myself.
I pull on the loose end of the carpeting, yanking it free from the staples,
then begin to roll it up.
The odors embedded in the shag over the past 40-some years rise up in tufts
as I make my way from one end of the long corridor to the other.
It smells like an old, neglected fishing cabin.
Stale cigarette smoke.
Beer.
Even the faintest scent of cat urine.
The pad beneath the carpet practically disintegrates in my hands.
It crumbles under pressure into a fine, grainy, gritty mess
that actually makes my skin crawl.
Halfway down the hallway, I uncover a square plywood patch covered with linoleum directly in the center of the hall,
probably where an old-fashioned heat grate used to be and was torn out.
I swear under my breath at the bad luck of it, but keep going, figuring I can pry up the square and fix it some other time.
When I reach the end of the hallway, I run a roll of masking tape around the trunk of the discarded carpeting and shove it down the stairs.
I look back down the hallway, already it's an improvement, but it isn't enough.
Not while the shag still lines the walls beneath the chair rail.
Dust and grime accumulate beneath my fingertips as I rip the carpeting from the plaster.
I cough and sneeze.
Sharp staples bite into my hands and snag the soles of my shoes.
So many staples, which I begin to yank out with pliers.
Pluck.
Pluck.
Pluck.
Some come easily.
Others need convincing.
I can't leave any sharp edges exposed with Sabrina mobile, so I have to work diligently until every single staple is yanked, creaking and screaming from the floor and walls.
I sweep mounds of dust and shards of staples into the bin.
The powerful stench of the rug still emanates from the walls and floor, however, so I run a sponge soaked with pine-scented cleaner over the space.
Twice.
By the time I finish carrying the whole mess down the stairs and onto the porch, my hands are blistered, I'm exhausted, and it's after two.
For a moment, I stand on the porch, if only to draw in some good, fresh air.
I look out over the vast stillness of the acreage.
One day, when the dead trees are completely cleared from the property and sunlight inspires grass to grow again,
and we're well past the renovations of this place, Sabrina will play in the yard.
Someday, it'll feel like home.
I lean against the house, right next to the marvelous door Bill the Tree Man found buried on my property, and listen to the wind and the leaves.
In the distance, I see the house where my husband grew up.
A single light illuminating the attic.
Maybe I'll drop in tomorrow to say hello to my in-laws, invite them to see the place.
It's odd that they haven't stopped over to see the baby, or even called to see if I need anything.
But maybe I should count my blessings.
What would I do if Therese were here every day, sticking her nose in my business?
It's late, and I'm too tired to debate the issue with myself.
I turn to go back inside, my hand already on the doorknob.
But the knob won't turn.
My heart instantly leaps into my throat.
I jiggle the knob again, but to no avail.
Have I locked myself out of the house?
How could I have done such a thing?
It's so late, and Sabrina is alone inside, sleeping on a bed, not in a crib.
Suppose she twists herself in the blankets.
Suppose she gets wrapped up in the sheets and can't breathe.
What kind of idiot does this?
I wipe tears from my eyes.
Please, I say aloud.
After another attempt, the latch gives way, and I enter.
I exhale.
It's just old hardware, stubborn with years of grime and dirt.
Tomorrow, I'll pull the knobs off the doors and properly clean and oil them.
I lock the door behind me and practically sprint up the stairs,
pass the linoleum square directly in the center of the hallway,
and check my sleeping child.
She's precious.
All I really want to do is curl up next to her and sleep.
But I'm as filthy as the shag carpet,
so I quickly shower before practically collapsing onto the mattress on the floor.
I still haven't found the time to assemble the headboard and frame
and take a few deep breaths.
I feel this house in my lungs, in my bones.
It'll be worth it, I whisper to my sleeping child.
I see what this place can be.
But for now, there's no denying I hate it.
I hate the way it looks.
Hate that nothing works.
Hate that it's going to cost me muscle aches and splinters
to make it only fractionally beautiful.
I even hate that my mother-in-law is my closest neighbor,
despite her respecting the distance.
And I hate that Edison is living it up in some posh Times Square hotel
while his child and I are here at this rat hole.
The house rattles with the strong winds whipping up the hill,
and every once in a while,
I hear a whistling,
which seems to reverberate,
as if traveling through the maze of old pipes
hidden in these papered walls.
I feel this house,
in my lungs,
in my bones.
I close my eyes
and imagine the door installed at the end of the hallway.
I pretend the home is gorgeous.
If it were,
maybe I'd be able to enjoy it.
And oh,
that wind.
I practically feel the breeze
filtering through the walls of this old place.
There's probably no insulation.
I wonder how unbearably cold
it's going to be come December.
The walls shiver with the next gust,
and a creak and a pop
echo in the hallway.
Yet Sabrina still sleeps,
her little lips puckered and sucking,
as if on a pacifier.
At least one of us will be well rested come sunrise.
I climb out of bed
to investigate the now recurring creaking,
but one step into the hallway,
I freeze and swallow a scream.
The attic door is again standing wide open,
and a breeze,
slow and steady,
rolls down the stairs in waves.
Cautiously,
I make my way down the hallway,
toward the high pitch of a whistle
coming from the attic.
My knees quiver with every step,
but I manage to make it
all the way to the attic access.
I close the door,
slamming into it with my shoulder
to ensure it stays shut.
Hey.
I flinch
when I hear the whisper behind me.
But no one's there.
I feel something,
even though there's nothing to see.
It's like the feeling you get
when you know someone's looking at you,
watching you sleep.
Anna.
I turn around again,
but find nothing but empty space.
Anna.
I hightail it all the way back
to the master bedroom,
to my baby.
She's still there,
still breathing,
still perfect and pink.
The windows rattle in their frames.
I try to catch my breath.
It wasn't real.
Just the wind.
Just my imagination.
Just an echo in the hallway.
Now that I've bared the floors,
I have to expect unusual sounds.
But I heard it.
Hey.
Anna.
Plain as day.
I'll stay awake.
It'll be murder tomorrow,
when Sabrina's crawling through boxes
and getting into everything.
But I can't fall asleep now.
Hey.
And if it were just my imagination,
would I hear it again and again?
I gather my daughter into my arms
to keep her close,
to keep her safe.
I listen hard,
begging for another chance
to rationalize it.
But no whisper
tufts in my ear.
The numbers on the clock
morph
from 311
to 312
to 313.
My eyes grow heavier
with each breath I take.
Suddenly,
seemingly seconds later,
my eyes pop open.
It's nearly 8 o'clock.
I must have managed to sleep.
Sabrina is giggling.
Zo.
3.
The Historical Society
The Parker's Landing
Historical Society
is located
in an enormous Victorian house
on the main drag-in town.
It's a couple of miles away,
and it's almost 90 degrees already.
By the time I reach Main Street,
my sundress is sticking to my legs,
and my skin is moist with sweat.
I regret not driving.
I roll Sabrina's stroller
up the ramp
to the large, airy porch,
then open one of the double doors
to enter the cool,
two-story foyer.
The place is a refuge
from the heat,
instantly relieving,
but it's also
breathtakingly beautiful.
My gasp echoes
in the open space.
Just the sight of it
awes me.
The marble inlaid floor,
the majestic crown molding,
the grand staircase.
This is what I'd envisioned
when Edison said
he wanted to buy
the house on Oak Avenue.
All the detail.
I trace the lines
of a white-painted
wainscot.
Good morning.
The elderly woman
at the welcome desk,
she's such a tiny,
frail-looking thing,
looks up at me
over hexagonal-framed glasses
and purses her lips,
as if she just tasted
something sour.
She glances at Sabrina,
then blinks her way
back to me.
Usually our patrons
leave their buggies
on the walk outside.
A quick look
over my shoulder
proves there's no signage
requesting such a thing.
I'm sorry,
I didn't know.
I move to roll it
back out the door.
I can just put it
right outside,
on the porch.
It'll surely awaken Sabrina
if I take her
out of the stroller.
But if that's the rule...
Well,
you've already rolled it
across the marble floor.
She says it
as if I've spit on it
as well.
The wheels didn't leave
a trace of evidence
of their passing
over the marble tiles.
My cheeks begin to burn,
with something between
annoyance and embarrassment.
Way to go, lady,
I want to say.
You've just offended
the only person likely
to walk through
your doors today.
What brings you
into the historical society?
She asks.
I just bought
the house on oak,
I say.
She narrows her gaze.
Eddie Clementine
just bought
the house on oak?
I know.
I'm his wife.
I offer my hand,
which she shakes
weakly.
I'm Anastasia.
Sophie Malcolm.
I'm wondering,
Miss Malcolm,
about the house,
about restoration,
if there are
any guidelines.
Such as?
The house needs
new siding.
Are there limitations
on the materials
I can use?
Good Lord.
Tell me you aren't
going to clad it
in vinyl.
There it is again,
the sourpuss expression.
I wouldn't,
no,
but I'm considering
a cement board
that looks like cedar,
more environmentally friendly.
Here in Parker's Landing,
we don't declare landmarks,
Mrs. Clementine.
You can ruin the house
any which way you please.
Pardon me,
but have you seen
the house on oak?
What they did to it
in 1976?
I'm trying to restore it,
is what I'm saying.
I want to make it
beautiful again.
That house belonged
to the town's
first lawyer,
you know.
No,
I,
he used to preside
over wedding ceremonies
right there
in your front parlor.
How charming.
And his grandson
eventually bought
the house
from the estate
when the senior
Churchill
was declared dead.
It was his wife
who oversaw
the bicentennial renovation.
That house
has been in the
Churchill family
since 1898.
A shame
one of their children
didn't want it.
I can understand why,
I say.
It needs a lot of work.
She busies herself
with jotting down words
in a spiral-bound notebook.
It doesn't need
vinyl siding.
Obviously,
I agree.
Ms. Malcolm,
I'm a historical specialist.
Before Edison and I
had our daughter,
I worked for the
Delacorte Restoration Society
in Chicago,
renovating,
and in some cases
replicating,
what's been lost
in buildings
of all kinds.
Believe me,
I want for that house
all the things
you must want for it,
but I don't want
to kill cedar trees
in order to site it.
You're killing trees
aplenty on your property
as we speak,
she mutters.
They are already dead.
I wouldn't take them
down otherwise.
What else can I do
for you,
Mrs. Clementine?
I'm wondering
about the people
who lived in the house
before.
The Churchills.
Have any of them
ever reported
anything strange
about the place?
Other than
Jeannie Churchill's
decorator stapling
shag carpeting
to the walls
in the upstairs hallway?
So you have
seen it.
Sophie Malcolm
offers a single
nod in response.
I mean,
strange,
unexplained.
The house
isn't haunted.
I have that
on good authority.
I didn't say
it was haunted,
but since you
mentioned it,
you've had the
discussion before
with previous owners?
No one but the
Churchills have
ever lived in
that house.
Maybe I could
talk to a
Churchill to
compare notes.
Big city folks
always think a
house with a
past is haunted.
First of all,
Ms. Malcolm,
I grew up in
the country.
Not this country,
but certainly it
wasn't a city.
Second,
Edison and I
have lived in
several buildings
older than this.
I appreciate
the home for
its age,
and I'm not
afraid of or
overwhelmed by
old houses.
But last night
something strange
happened.
My dear,
you look tired.
Eddie's away and
you're doubtless
very busy from
the look of your
hands.
I close my
blistered hands
over the bars of
Sabrina's stroller.
Perhaps you
simply need some
good rest.
Ms. Malcolm
literally turns
her back on me
now,
swiveling in her
chair and taking
her notebook to
the credenza
behind her.
Perhaps I do,
but I could have
sworn I heard a
whisper in the
hallway last night.
Mrs. Malcolm is
completely engrossed
in her writing now,
but I have more
questions.
I try again.
Might you have
pictures of what
the place used to
look like?
There's pegboard on
the kitchen walls.
Pegboard!
Can you believe
it?
I dare say that
wasn't there in
1898.
She emits a sigh
of exasperation
and swivels back
toward me.
Her hands are
folded now atop
her desk,
and she regards
me as if she's
in a nun's habit
and I'm a wayward
teen at Immaculate
Conception High.
You married
Eddie Clementine.
Yes,
I did.
Your father-in-law
knows as much
about this town
as anyone.
Perhaps he
could help you.
I'm sorry.
Have I offended
you,
Miss Malcolm?
Of course not.
Should I have
made an appointment
to speak with you?
If that's the case,
I don't take
appointments.
I see.
So,
I should ask
my father-in-law
for pictures
of the house?
Please.
I begin
toward the door.
Sorry to have
bothered you.
It won't happen
again.
Mrs. Clementine?
I stop
in my tracks.
Welcome
to Parker's Landing.
It's a nice
sentiment,
but there's
an edge
to her tone.
Taunting,
sarcastic,
maybe.
I do hope
you will enjoy
our architecture
during your stay.
I am
staying,
I whisper,
perhaps to
convince myself
as much as to
prove it to this
old bag.
With the buds
of tears
rimming my eyes,
I exit into
the oppressive
heat.
Now I really
regret walking
into town
on a day
so hot.
The wheels
of the stroller
harumph
as they roll
down the ramp.
Mama?
Sabrina yawns
as she stirs.
Hi,
baby girl.
Once we're a few
feet down the
sidewalk,
in the shade
of an awning,
I crouch beside
the stroller
and sniffle
over tears.
It's ridiculous
that I've let
cranky old
Sophie Malcolm
get to me,
but I'm honestly
stunned over
her chilly
reception.
Let's get home,
sweet pea,
away from that
awful woman.
Ma'am?
I turn toward
the deep voice.
A man,
about my age,
maybe a little
older,
leans out the
window of an
open-air diner
called the
Crescent Moon
Cafe.
I'm Cody
Granger.
Anastasia
Clementine.
Ah,
Eddie's wife.
Anastasia,
I correct him.
Just bought
the place
on Oak,
huh?
I'm about
to affirm
when he
continues.
Couldn't
help but
overhear.
Sophie Malcolm's
been an old
bitch since
long before
she was
an old
bitch.
He can't
take anything
she says
personally.
He sips
from a
sweating
glass,
sweet tea,
probably.
I would
know.
She was
my fourth
grade teacher.
My
condolences,
your fourth
grade year
must have
been unbearable.
That it
was.
He
chuckles.
That
it
was.
Hey,
listen,
you need
anything.
He hands
over a
business card.
You give
me a
call.
You
here?
You're a
contractor.
I am.
Well,
I'm sure
you'll be
hearing from
us then,
just as
soon as
I can
pull
together
some
funds
for the
renovation.
I'm
also a
cigar
aficionado,
believer in
the harmony
of life
and craft
beer,
and one
hell of a
softball
player.
So if
you're in
need of
a friend.
Oh.
I can't
help but
smile at
his kindness.
He's the
first person
who's treated
me with
an inkling
of respect
since I
set foot
in this
ville.
Thanks.
I'm sure
we'll be
seeing you
around.
Looking
forward to
it.
Four.
The
drink.
Look
who's
home.
I
balance
Sabrina
on my
hip and
open the
front door
for her
father as
he's
climbing the
porch
stairs.
Instantly,
the baby
reaches for
him.
Edison ignores
her attempt
and,
once inside,
tosses his
carry-on bag
to the
foyer floor.
He pins
me down
with an
uncomfortable
stare.
You met
Cody
Granger
today.
Word
travels
fast around
here.
I
shift
Sabrina
from
one
hip
to
the
other.
Yeah,
nice
guy.
He's
never
been
a
nice
guy.
Well,
he was
nice
to
me.
I
bet he
was.
Is
that
what
you
were
wearing
when
you
ran
into
him
in
town?
I
look
down
at
my
sundress,
now
stained
with
the
spattering
of
Sabrina's
mashed
carrots,
which
is
the
only
thing
I
see
wrong
with
it.
I
bring
a
hand
to
the
orange
stain
on
my
left
breast.
Maybe
I
should
have
changed
before
Ed
got
home.
Do
you
think
he
would
have
gone
out
of
his
way
to
speak
to
you
if
you'd
been
wearing
something
a
little
more...
He
sizes
me
up.
Conservative?
What's
not
conservative
about
a
sundress?
This
one's
a
basic
A-line.
There's
nothing
sexy
about
it.
He
wants
to
get
No.
Yeah.
His
words
are like
a
twisting
knife
in my
heart.
This
isn't
like
my
husband.
He's
not
the
jealous
sort.
He
unfastens
his
cufflinks
and
begins
to
roll
up
his
sleeves.
He
knows
I'm
your
wife.
Why
would
he...
Trust
me.
He's
always
trying
to
get
into
someone's.
Oh.
The
headache
I've
had
since
I
spoke
with
Sophie
Malcolm
stabs
at
me
between
the
eyes.
I've
been
having
a
pretty
hard
time.
No
one
seems
to
want
to
accept
an
outsider
like
me.
And
maybe
I
didn't
notice
the
guy's
ulterior
motives.
I'm
just
saying.
Ed
rushes
past
me,
again
ignoring
our
daughter's
outstretched
arms,
and begins
up the
stairs.
It's
not
your
fault.
This
place
isn't
like
the
city,
Anna.
You're
not
anonymous
here.
People
are
going
to
jump
to
conclusions.
People
are
going
to
talk.
I
follow
him
as
he
climbs.
What
are
they
talking
about?
I
had
a
two-minute
conversation
with
the
guy.
Wow.
My
husband
pauses
at the
top
of the
stairs.
This
is
different.
I
just
couldn't
handle
that
awful
shag
carpeting
anymore.
It
looks...
His
brow
knits
as he
studies
the
upstairs
hallway.
He
tilts
his
head
as
if
looking
at
it
from
another
point
of
view.
Better,
right?
He
shrugs.
Unfinished.
Of
course,
but
better
than
the
shag?
I
guess.
You
don't
like
it.
I
didn't
say
that.
It
was
embedded
with
grime
and
cat
piss
and
cigarette
smoke.
And
our
child
plays
on
it.
I
had
to
get
rid
of
it.
In
that
case,
I'm
glad
you
did.
I
follow
him
down
the
hall
to
our
bedroom
where
I've
made
more
progress.
You
put
the
bed
together.
I
did.
And
the
portable
crib.
It
gives
me
a
wink.
when
when
when
are
we
planning
to
let
her
sleep
in
the
nursery?
There's
a
pitch
in
the
floor
that
has
to
be
fixed.
The
crib
keeps
rolling
into
the
closet.
Maybe
we
can
nail
some
wood
blocks
to
the
floor
to
keep
it
in
place
in
the
meantime
or
something.
Ah,
the
joys
of owning
an
old
house.
He
leans
into
me
and
pecks
a
kiss
on
my
lips.
The
just
a
quick
one.
And
actually
I
was
thinking
if
you
wouldn't
mind
I'd
like
to
go
back
out.
But
we
haven't
seen
each
other
all
week.
I
haven't
seen
my
high
school
friends
in
years.
He
sits
on
the
bed
and
pulls
his
shoes
from
his
feet
trading
his
oxfords
for a
pair
of
tennis
shoes.
It
feels
good
to
be
home,
you
know?
I
won't
be
out
late.
I
promise.
Okay.
I
try not
to sound
disappointed,
but after
only having
conversations
with the
baby all
week long
and then
treating
myself to
Ms.
Malcolm's
near
verbal
abuse,
there's
no hiding
that I
am.
If it
weren't
such late
notice,
I'd
ask my
parents to
come watch
the baby
and you
could come
out with
me.
Next
time,
I say,
and I
won't
be out
late.
He
promises
again.
I
wholeheartedly
believe
him.
He
rarely
goes
out,
and he
rarely
has
more
than
two
cocktails
when he
does.
He
reaches
for
Sabrina,
who
happily
spills
into
his
arms
and
plants
a
sloppy
kiss
on
his
face.
Mommy
looks
tired
anyway,
doesn't
she,
Brina?
I
wish
people
would
stop
saying
that.
It's
been a
long
week,
I
say,
by way
of explaining
the dark
rings under
my
eyes.
To say
nothing of
Ed's
decision
to go
out,
practically
reducing
me to
tears.
Rough.
Tell me
about it.
I wish
I could
sleep in,
just once.
I
should let
it go.
I
should let
it roll
off my
shoulders,
but I
can't
ignore the
implication
that I've
got it
so easy.
You
know I
don't sleep
in,
right?
If I
sleep
until
eight,
it's
because the
babies
had me
up several
times in
the middle
of the
night.
Whoa,
I didn't
say anything.
Yes,
you did.
Even if I
wake up at
eight,
I've probably
gotten a
fraction of
the sleep
you get,
so I
don't want
to hear
it.
That's
precisely
why she
should
sleep in
the nursery.
Edison rises
from our
mattress and
places Sabrina
into my
arms.
I'll be
back by
ten.
Ed,
come on,
don't leave
angry.
Maybe you
should take
a nap.
He shrugs
out of his
button-down
and pulls
on a
t-shirt.
Sleep
when the
baby
sleeps.
Don't
spend the
evening
yanking
up old
carpeting,
especially
when it's
going to
leave the
place
looking
half
finished.
You
don't
get it.
You
don't
have to
live
here.
Oh,
I don't
live here
now?
You
live in
Times Square,
we both
know that.
Well,
I'm here
now.
You've
been here
for two
minutes and
you're
already
leaving.
Without
another
word,
my husband
storms
through the
hallway and
down the
stairs.
Edison!
He ignores
me and
walks out
the door.
But I
know it'll
all be
better when
he gets
home,
when he's
unwound a
bit from
a long
week building
databases in
New York,
and when I've
had a moment
to rest.
I go through
the motions
the rest of
the night,
bathe the
baby,
read to
her,
build a
village with
blocks,
for the
thirtieth
time today.
Finally,
I find an
on-demand
movie to
occupy her
while I
unpack another
box.
Ten o'clock
comes and
goes without
a sign of
Edison,
and when I
see Sabrina
about to
nod off,
it's time to
stop waiting
for him.
As I pass
the attic
door,
I pause.
A creepy
sensation
dances up
my spine.
I can't
endure another
night like
last night,
but I'm
too tired
to be
afraid right
now.
And
according to
Sophie Malcolm,
who has it
on good
authority,
this house
isn't haunted
anyway.
What does
good authority
mean?
How would
anyone know
what's happening
in my house
unless she
spent ample
time here?
If she
weren't an
abrasive old
bitty,
I might have
pressed her
for further
explanation.
Maybe,
once she
has time
to get to
know me,
or at least
when she
gets used
to the fact
that one
of Parker's
Landing's
children
married
outside the
town limits,
she'll offer
more about
her good
authority.
But I
wonder,
why the
vehement
insistence
that the
place isn't
haunted?
Why did
Ms.
Malcolm
immediately
go there?
Unless
there's
history of
it.
A few
hours later,
I awaken
with a
start when
a gust of
wind rushes
into the
room.
Instantly,
I know
the attic
door is
open again.
Ed?
I roll
over to
wake him,
but he's
not home
yet.
It's
nearly
three in
the morning,
and I
check my
phone.
He hasn't
called or
texted.
Across the
room in the
portable crib,
Sabrina
giggles in
her sleep.
I dial
Ed's
number,
but I'm
kicked straight
to voicemail.
His phone
battery must
have died.
The eerie
whistling,
the same I
heard last
night,
echoes in
the hallway.
I can do
this.
My limbs
tremble as I
stand and
approach the
hallway.
As expected,
the attic
door is
wide open.
Just go?
Close the
door,
I tell
myself.
I begin
my approach
to the attic
stairwell
slowly,
but the
nearer I
get,
the more
quickly I
step.
I reach
for the
door,
but a
second before
I close
it,
a whisper.
Anna?
I jump,
but this
time there's
a logical
explanation for
what I
heard.
Edison is
sitting on
the floor
of the
hallway,
near the
stairs leading
down to
the kitchen.
I coerce
the attic
door closed.
What are
you doing
here?
Lamenting.
His head
hangs low,
but he
turns his
eyes up
at me.
Me too.
I'm sorry
about earlier.
Come to
bed.
When he
smiles,
it's like
no smile
I've ever
seen from
him before.
Sinister
and dripping
with a
leering
satisfaction.
With
you?
Yes.
You
expect me
to come
to bed
with you?
Yes.
He
stumbles
as he
stands.
When he
smiles,
it's like
no smile
I've ever
seen from
him before.
I reach
to help
steady him,
but instead
of taking
my hand,
he shoves
me out
of the
way.
My shoulder
slams into
the attic
door and
I slip.
Before I
regain my
footing,
he pushes
me again,
and I'm
helpless to
catch myself
before I
tumble to
the floor.
He's on
his feet
now,
towering
over me
and laughing.
Ed?
Poor
baby.
His
laughter
booms
in the
hallway.
I
scramble
toward our
bedroom,
trip,
and make
my way
on all
fours,
because I
can't stop
shaking,
can't manage
to stand
without slipping
back to the
parquet.
Tears
blur my
vision,
but a
glance over
my shoulder
proves he's
stayed put,
pointing,
laughing.
Poor,
poor
baby,
with no
friends.
I
look over
my shoulder.
The
attic door
pops from
its frame
and slowly
opens.
The
wind
filters
down the
hallway.
No
friends!
Edison
doubles over
laughing.
No
friends!
I
cross the
threshold
and slam
the bedroom
door behind
me.
I
turn the
lock on
the knob
and,
sobbing,
take the
baby from
the crib.
I hold
her close
and watch
her sleep.
Nothing
will happen
to her.
Not on
my watch.
Five,
the
denial.
I'm
telling you,
it didn't
happen.
Ed,
not at all
hungover,
not at all
repentant about
his behavior
last night,
walks past
in a towel,
dripping with
shower water
and completely
oblivious to
the terror
he inflicted
on me.
I stayed
later than
I thought
I would,
but I had
only one
drink.
I wasn't
in any
way drunk.
You
pushed
me.
I
turned to
once again
show him
the bruises
on my
back and
shoulder.
You
bruised
me and
laughed at
it all
to boot.
Anastasia.
He
steps into
a pair
of boxers
and reaches
for me.
I pull
away.
Don't
touch
me.
Look,
you're
exhausted.
How much
have you
slept in
the past
few days?
A few
hours,
maybe?
I
shouldn't
have gone
out last
night.
The
stress of
the move,
the house
being less
than we
thought it
would be.
It's
too much
for you.
I hate
how he
says it.
As if
anyone
else
could
handle
it
with
one
hand
tied
behind
her
back.
But
I'm
incapable,
too
delicate
and
fragile.
You
pushed
me.
I
wouldn't
do
that.
I
know
you
normally
wouldn't
do
that,
but
you
weren't
yourself
last
night.
He
chuckles.
I
was
fine
last
night.
Fine?
Then
how do
you
explain
this?
I
indicate
the
marring
on my
back.
I
don't
know.
Maybe
you
were
half
asleep
and
slipped
and
fell
on
the
hallway
floor.
Again,
with the
hallway
carpeting.
It was
disgusting.
It had
to come
out.
Hannah,
relax.
I wasn't
talking about
the carpeting.
My shoulders
shake with
my sobbing.
I
draw my
knees
to my
chest
and
bury
my
head
there.
It
wasn't
a
bad
dream
and
I
didn't
just
fall.
Did
I?
I
don't
know,
but I
know I
wouldn't
hurt you.
I
came home
around
midnight.
I
looked in
on you
and
the
baby.
I
put a
movie
on
downstairs,
had
a
snack,
and
fell
asleep
on
the
sofa.
Around
five,
I
woke up
and went
upstairs,
but the
bedroom door
was
locked.
I
were
out
of
your
mind,
sitting
there in
the
hallway
laughing
at
me
with
that
damn
attic
door
opening
on
its
own.
The
door.
Yes,
it
opens
on
its
own.
It's
an
old
house.
Things
like
that
are
going
to
happen.
And
if
you're
telling
me
you
weren't
drunk,
then
you
don't
even
have
an
excuse
for
acting
that
way.
I
think
it's
pretty
clear
what's
happening.
You
were
stressed
out.
You've
got a
lot
on
your
plate
and
given
the
state
of
this
place.
When
you're
used
to
making
places
beautiful
and
you
have
to
live
in
this
monument
to
an
ear
allotting
bell
bottoms
and
tab
collars,
it's
no
wonder
you
can't
relax.
You're
working
nonstop
to
make
this
place
decent,
aren't
you?
For
all
we
know,
you're
bruised
from
bumping
into
things
while
hauling
all
that
carpeting
outside
on
your
own.
His
hand
lands
on
my
back.
This
time,
I
allow
him
to
touch
me.
I
hate
it
here,
Ed.
I
hate
it.
I
hate
that
your
parents
still
don't
like
me
after
all
these
years,
even
after
I
had
their
first
grandchild.
I
hate
this
town.
I
hate
this
house.
And
I
hate
that
awful
woman
at
the
historical
society
who
first,
my
parents
will
come
around.
They
hardly
know
you.
Second,
Sophie
Malcolm?
He
starts
to
chuckle,
but
cuts
it
off
the
moment
I
shoot
a
glare
in
his
direction.
She
won't
tell me
anything
about
this
house,
and
she
was
annoyed
that
I
even
walked
through
the
door.
Edison
sighs.
Honey,
did
you
offer
to
buy
her
book?
She
wrote
a
book
about
this
town
and
its
settlers
and
its
first
houses
and
businesses.
If
you
went
in
there
asking
for
free
information,
he
shrugs.
Maybe
that's
why
she
was
frosty.
How
was
I
supposed
to
know
she
wrote
a
book?
I
would
have
bought
the
damn
thing.
Tell
me
more
about
the
door
you
found.
I
sniffle.
Bill's
crew
brought
it to
the
back
patio
so
I
could
clean
and
strip
it.
And
you
like
it?
You
want
to
incorporate
it
into
the
renovation?
I
think
it
belongs
at
the
end
of
the
hallway.
Finally,
I look
at him.
A
flash
of the
evil
grin
he
sported
last
night
revisits
me,
but only
for a
split
second
before
it
fades
back
into
my
memory,
leading
to
the
attic.
Let's
go have
a look
at it,
okay?
I'll
call
my
parents.
They'll
come
get
the
baby,
and
then
you
and
I
will
spend
the
day
together.
Want
to
clean
up
that
door
together?
Maybe
grab
some
lunch,
a glass
of
wine
in
the
afternoon?
He
drops
a kiss
on my
lips,
then
another,
deeper
this
time.
His
hand
is on
my
hip,
so
warm,
so
familiar,
and he's
leaning over
me,
pressing
his nearly
naked
body
to
mine,
lowering
me to
my
back.
This
is my
husband.
I don't
know who
I
encountered
in the
hallway
last night.
I can't
reconcile
one man
with the
other.
Either
Edison
is succumbing
to whatever
resides beyond
that door
at the end
of the
hallway,
or I
really
did
dream
it
all.
I
weave
my
fingers
into
his
hair
and
hook
a
leg
around
his
waist.
Either
way,
it'll
all be
better
now.
Six
Crackers
We didn't
mention the
episode again
the rest of
that weekend.
Not when
we stripped
the door
of its
dirt and
grime.
Not when
we scraped
a century's
worth of
paint from
its
crevices and
treated it
to a
turpentine
scrub.
And not
when we
carried it
into our
new home.
The whole
scene must
have been a
dream.
A very
intense,
vivid
dream.
But the
house feels
happier this
week,
now that the
door is
propped against
the wall in
the front
parlor,
a drop
cloth spread
beneath it.
The oppressive
weight I've
been feeling
is gone
now.
Or,
perhaps I
really did
just need
to get a
good night's
sleep.
Ed will
be home
tomorrow.
The week
has passed
without major
incident.
The attic
door still
opens,
of course.
But as
everyone keeps
telling me,
I should
expect things
like that to
happen in a
house so
old.
With Sabrina
on my hip,
as always,
I place a
bag of
groceries on
the kitchen
countertop,
then carry
her to
the front
room,
where both
the door
and her
toys are
currently
housed.
I stand
back,
and from
a distance,
I study
what has
to be the
architectural
find of
the century.
The
graining of
the fur,
raw and
breathing for
the first
time in
decades,
is open
and ready
for stain.
Pretty
door,
isn't it,
pumpkin?
Pretty,
Sabrina
parrots.
I set
her down
on the
floor,
she hugs
me tight,
her chubby
cheek pressed
to my
leg,
and looks
up at
me with
her
angelic
blue
eyes.
Zozo,
Zozo.
What is
Zozo?
I ask.
Zo.
She grins.
Show,
mommy.
She walks
over to the
door and
pats it
with her
palm.
Zo.
Zozo,
Zozo.
Is that
right?
I crouch
next to
her.
Are you
trying to
say
door?
Brina,
look at
mama.
I
over-enunciate.
Door.
Zo.
Such a
happy child.
Even
through last
weekend's
turmoil,
she remained
content.
When daddy
comes home
tomorrow,
we're going
to refinish
it and
hang it
upstairs.
She drops
onto her
diaper bottom,
then rights
herself on
her feet
again,
and toddles
toward her
bin of
blocks.
I spill
the blocks
onto the
floor and
touch the
iTunes icon
on my
phone.
I'll put
away the
snacks,
and then
I'll be
right back
to play,
okay?
She nods,
already
engrossed
with her
toys.
Okay.
I pat
her on
the head
and return
to the
kitchen.
I feel
an
inexplicable
cold the
moment I
pass through
the hallway,
an
uncomfortable
icicle
stabbing at
my spine.
It's as if
the temperature
dropped 20
degrees once
I crossed
the threshold.
And once
I round
the corner,
I turn
numb.
I can't
garner voice
enough to
scream.
There's a
fine white
powder coating
the countertops.
What in
God's name?
Is it
snow?
The
substance is
room temperature
and grainy,
like sand.
I look up at
the ceiling to
see if the
tiles have
begun to
disintegrate,
but of
course they
haven't.
At closer
inspection,
I see
it's
crushed
crackers.
The box
I just
purchased
is out
of the
bag and
overturned.
The
cellophane
sleeves
that contain
the columns
of crackers
are shredded.
And the
crackers
themselves
are pounded
to dust.
The music
from my
phone stops.
The baby
lets out
a wail.
Instantly,
I dart
back toward
the front
room.
She's not
where I
left her.
Sabrina?
My gaze
trips over
the unearthed
door,
which is
now flat
on the
floor,
as if it
tipped forward
over her
pile of
blocks.
Oh,
God.
It could
have landed
on her.
Her next
shriek comes
from the
opposite
corner of
the room,
and finally,
I see her
huddled there,
tears streaming
down her
red cheeks,
one white
knuckled fist
tightened around
a block.
I scoop
her up and
we take
off.
A few
seconds later,
she's clinging
to me,
and I'm
out of
breath,
kicking up
dust behind
me as I
carry her
down this
barren road
someone dared
to call an
avenue.
There's a
pickup truck
ahead.
If only I
can catch
the driver's
attention,
if only he'll
help.
I brave a
glance over
my shoulder
and slow my
pace when the
house,
from the
outside,
looks just
the same as
it did the
first time I
saw it.
Deceptively
idyllic,
warm,
and inviting.
I'm not
running anymore,
but walking
backward,
and very
quickly down
the street in
the opposite
direction.
But there's
nowhere for
us to go,
save my
in-law's
place,
and to be
honest,
I'm not
sure which
is the
lesser of
the two
evils.
I tighten
my grip
on my
daughter.
Shh,
it's okay
now.
It's okay?
It's over
now.
The
sounds of
a truck's
tires on
pavement
draw near.
Anastasia!
The wind
whips up
the hill
and through
my hair,
but once
I manage
to rake
the mass
of now
wind-blown
hair from
my face,
I'm relieved
to see
him.
Cody
Granger,
the guy
I met
last week.
I award
him only
a split
second glance
before I
look back
to the
house
for any
sign of
the malice
that so
recently
erupted
within.
It's
Anastasia,
right?
You're
Eddie's
wife.
Yeah.
Although
at the
moment,
I feel
more like
Ed's
kidney.
An
extension
of him,
really.
Transplanted
into a
foreign
being,
this
town.
Nice
to see
you again.
I
nod,
still
staring at
the seemingly
content
Victorian a
few hundred
yards away.
Are
you
okay?
I'm
really
not.
Seven,
the
crescent
moon.
And
the door
fell,
Cody
says,
right where
your daughter
was playing.
We're
sitting at
a table
inside the
crescent
moon
cafe,
where Cody
is treating
us to
lunch.
He
insisted,
and I
had to
calm
down,
so I
accepted
the
invitation.
I
don't
have my
wallet or
my
phone or
even a
diaper bag
because I
refuse to
go back
inside the
house.
I
don't
think it
fell,
I say.
It's
heavy,
and I
would have
heard it,
but even
if I
somehow
missed the
sonic
boom,
it either
would have
tipped
forward,
right,
or it
would have
slipped,
like,
here.
I
position a
napkin
with the
short end
of it
against the
table
edge.
If it
fell,
or even
if it
slipped,
the short
end would
be against
the wall,
like this.
But it's
almost like
it was
mindfully
lowered to
the ground,
because it's
positioned like
this now.
I turn my
rectangular
napkin so
the long
edge of it
is parallel
to the
table.
He
frowns.
You
didn't hear
anything?
See
anything?
Mr.
Granger,
call me
Cody,
please.
Sophie
Malcolm
obviously
doesn't
believe in
ghosts.
Oh,
she
believes,
all right.
She
hosts the
annual
ghost walk
every
Halloween.
Well,
either way,
she insists
the house
isn't haunted
and...
You
think it
is?
I
don't know
how else
to explain
the door,
and the
crackers,
and the
wind howling
through the
place.
He
gnaws on
his lower
lip,
nodding.
Did you
know the
Churchills?
I dated
one of their
daughters,
Nicole.
You
did?
So you
must have
spent time
in the
house?
Some.
Did you
ever experience
anything
strange?
He replies
with a slow
shake of his
head.
Of course
not.
I say,
I'm the
only one.
And the
other night,
I
shut up.
I
shouldn't
tell him
about the
incident
with
Edison.
What
happened?
My
husband
said he
wasn't
drunk.
But it
doesn't
make sense
unless...
Thursday,
when he
was up
at the
depot?
He
said he
only had
one
drink.
One?
At
this,
Cody
breaks
into a
grin.
I've
never
known
Eddie
Clementine
to
stop
at
one
anything.
A
funny
sensation
swirls
in my
gut.
He
was
drunk?
I
wouldn't
call him
sober.
He
doesn't
drink
much.
Really?
He
may as
well be
rolling
his
eyes.
I've
known the
guy my
whole
life.
He
gave
new
meaning
to
the
word
party
in
high
school.
Well,
I pretend
not to be
surprised and
shrug off
the comment.
people
change.
I'm
sure
they
do.
If
last
Thursday
my
husband
was
intoxicated,
I'm
moderately
relieved.
While I
can't believe
Edison
lied to
me,
and I'm
certainly
concerned
about the
way alcohol
changed him
that night,
it explains
a few
things.
I
can't
imagine
what he
might have
told you
about
me,
Cody
says.
Before I
have a
chance to
reply,
he admits,
we
haven't
always
seen
eye
to
eye,
Eddie
and
me.
And
people
talk.
Word is
going to
get around
that I
had lunch
with
Cody,
that we
showed up
at the
cafe
together,
him,
the
baby,
and me,
that he
picked up
the tab
and drove
us home.
I start
to consolidate
the plates
on the
table.
Thank
you for
lunch,
but I
really should
be getting
back.
You
sure
you're
okay
now?
He
pulls a
couple
of
twenties
out
of
his
wallet
and
drops
some
on
the
table.
Gotta
go back
sometime.
I
unbuckle
the
strap
on
the
high
chair,
where
Sabrina
with
heavy
eyelids
is
gnawing
on
a
french
fry.
She
curls
up
in
my
arms.
I
offer
Cody
a
hand
for
a
shake.
Thank
you.
I'll
drive
you.
It's
out
of
the
way
and
you've
got
your
hands
full
and
it's
hot.
Last
week,
even
with
good
walking
shoes
on
and
Sabrina
in
a
stroller,
the
walk
back
from
town
was
tough.
I
don't
mind,
he
says.
I'll
walk
you
in
and
make
sure
everything's
okay.
Despite
the way
it's
going to
look to
the rest
of the
town,
I
acquiesce.
The
closer we
draw to
the
house,
the
tighter
the
ball
in
my
gut
becomes.
I
know
my
story
about
the
crackers
sounds
crazy,
but
even
more
concerning
is my
fear that
we'll
go back
inside to
find it
was all
my
imagination.
As much
as I'd
be relieved
if it
were,
what might
be wrong
with me
if I'm
conjuring
such
sinister
events?
Cody
pulls up
to the
house and
kills
the
engine.
I've
got your
back,
girl.
He
grins
like the
Cheshire
cat,
and we
get out
of the
truck.
By
now,
Sabrina
is sleeping
soundly.
Hesitantly,
I climb
the front
walk.
I take
a deep
breath,
and enter.
The
sounds of
angry
whispering
and a
strange
whisking
instantly
meet my
ears.
I glance
at my
new
friend,
whose
nod
confirms
he
hears
it
too.
My
fingertips
go numb,
and my
knees
tremble as
I walk
through the
front
parlor,
where the
door remains
flat on
the floor,
long end
against the
wall.
I grab
my phone
from the
side table,
right where
I left
it,
and walk
toward the
kitchen.
The hiss
of the
whispers is
undeniable
now,
angry and
deliberate.
I take a
deep breath
and round
the corner.
But once I
enter the
kitchen,
what on
earth?
My
mother-in-law
grumbles as
she sweeps the
fine cracker dust
from the
countertops and
into the
trash can.
I exhale
at last.
Filthy
mess.
Therese?
She jumps
a little.
What are you
doing here?
Her lips are
pressed into a
thin white line,
and her gaze
practically burns
a laser right
through me.
Oh,
what this must
look like.
I take a step
away from my
companion.
Eddie
couldn't get
a hold of
you.
He was
worried.
I glance
at my
phone in
my hand.
Seven
missed
calls.
I told him
I'd come
check on
you.
See how
you were
settling
in?
I didn't
know you
were.
She looks
me up
and down.
Busy.
No.
It's all
I can
manage.
It seems
you have
this mess
under control
here.
Therese
drops her
sponge and
turns for
the back
door.
No,
wait,
I say.
Something
happened.
She glares
at me.
I'm sure
it did.
She storms
out of the
house,
cell phone
already at
her ear.
I assume
she's reporting
the scene
to her
son.
I
should,
um,
Cody
backs away.
I should
go.
The house
is eerily
quiet once
the doors
close.
I
die on
my
husband,
but I'm
dumped into
voicemail
after half
a ring.
I imagine
his mother's
already
tattling some
half-truths
and assumptions
about what
she observed
between Cody
Granger and
me.
God,
I have to
get out
of here.
I can't
stay in
this house.
I pack a
bag for
Sabrina and
me,
but just
as I'm
about to
head out
the door,
I stop.
There's
nowhere for
me to
go.
8.
Treading
water.
I could
have gone
to a
hotel,
I suppose,
but Ed
wouldn't
answer my
calls all
night.
I didn't
think it
would look
good not
to be
home if
he happened
to call.
I imagined
how the
conversation
might have
gone.
Hi,
hon.
No,
the baby
and I
are at
a hotel.
Yes,
I know
funds are
tight at
the moment.
Therese
did see
Cody and
me
together,
but I'm
not at
a hotel
with him.
We're
here because
we're
afraid of
the house.
Yes,
afraid of
the things
you can't
see,
afraid of
things I
can't
explain or
prove.
I know
this house
is haunted,
and no,
I'm not
crazy.
Needless
to say,
I decided
to brave
the consequences
of the
house.
The wind
howled in
the hallway
all night
long and
the door
kept creeping
its way
open.
I haven't
slept since
I found
the crackers
pounded to
dust in
the kitchen.
I don't
have a chance
to explain
things to
Edison,
the door,
the crackers,
the lunch
with Cody
Granger,
until he
arrives home
the next
day.
There's no
response from
him for the
longest 30
seconds of
my life.
And then,
all he says
is,
Uh-huh.
You have
to believe
me.
I fold
my arms
over my
middle as
I pace,
fit to
wear a
trench in
the bedroom
floor.
He coughs,
then says,
The kitchen
is filthy.
I know.
I left
the crackers
so you
could see.
We have
a child
to think
about.
Of course
I'm thinking
of Sabrina.
That's why
we have to
put this
house back
on the
market.
We have
to sell
it.
We have
to move.
And I
know we
will lose
money.
No one
will pay
what we
paid for
this dump,
but...
Anna?
He closes
his hands
around my
biceps and
directs me
to sit
on our
bed.
Please,
Anna,
tell me
the truth.
He's gotten
to you,
hasn't he?
Who?
Who do
you think?
He tightens
his grip.
Cody
Granger.
Tears
well in
my eyes.
That's
all you
have to
say to
me?
We have
to sell
it.
We have
to move.
I don't
know why
else you'd
insist on
moving.
He got
to you,
tempted
you.
And if
you want
to save
our
marriage,
you have
to distance
yourself.
No,
Ed!
I've
wanted to
live here
since I
was eight
years old.
And I'm
not giving
up this
house because
he's managed
to charm
his way
into your
pants in
just a
couple
weeks'
time.
Edison,
please!
This
isn't about
Cody
Granger.
He
happened to
be there
and I
was
terrified.
And yet
you stayed
in the
house last
night.
Terrified.
Ask
anyone at
the
crescent
moon.
They'll
tell you
it was
nothing but
lunch
between,
oh,
they told
me all
right.
They told
me my
wife looked
like she'd
just been
rolled in
the hay.
They told
me his
truck was
parked down
the street
all night
long.
This nearly
stops my
heart.
If it
was,
I don't
know why.
I'm not
stupid,
Anna.
I love
you,
Edison.
I have
to get
out of
here.
He tears
his way
out of his
khakis and
steps into
a pair of
board shorts.
It's not
enough that
he slept
with my
high school
girlfriend.
He had
to get
his hooks
into you
too.
I don't
know anything
about your
girlfriend from
high school,
but how
could you,
Anna?
How could
you do
this?
I didn't
do anything
wrong.
You have
to believe
me.
You have
to listen
to what
I'm telling
you.
We can't
stay in
this house.
I can't
stay in
it with
you.
I need
a drink.
within
seconds,
he's
barreling
out the
door,
and the
tires of
his sedan
are screeching
down the
road.
I gather
Sabrina's
things and
pack a
bag.
He'll
come home
with a
clearer
head.
He'll
listen.
He will.
And if
he won't,
the baby
and I
will leave.
Whore!
I'm
not fully
awake when
I'm yanked
from the
sofa.
I land
on the
threadbare
woolen
carpeting
and hit
my head
against
the leg
of a
side
table.
Sabrina
shrieks
from across
the room.
I blink
hard,
rub my
head,
and try
to get
to my
feet.
Baby?
I say.
Mommy's
coming.
But a
kick to
my gut
sends me
back to
the floor.
I wrench
in pain.
Edison's
silhouette
looms
over me,
but I
can't
focus
on him.
A
cold
wind
whips
through
the
room,
and a
high-pitched
whistling
fills
my ears.
Sabrina
screams,
Zo,
Zo,
Zo,
Zo,
Zo,
Zo!
I
crawl
toward her,
but he's
on me
again,
this time
pulling me
by the
hair.
I kick
and scratch
at him
until I
manage to
get to
my feet
and fight
back.
The
stench
of scotch
on his
breath
dizzies
me
for a
second,
but his
inebriation
works in
my favor.
I shove
him and
he stumbles
back.
It buys
me enough
time to
gather
Sabrina
in my
arms.
We're
shaking,
it's
freezing
in here.
Zo,
so,
so,
so,
so,
so,
so,
she says
on a
breath
broken
with her
sobs.
By the
time
Edison's
on his
feet
again,
I have
my phone
in my
hand,
and I'm
out the
door with
my
daughter.
It's
just after
three.
Edison's
car is
parked next
to mine,
and the
house is
dark,
save for
one dim
light in
the kitchen,
which I
left on
so Ed
could find
his way
in after
the bar.
I bounce
the baby
in my
arms,
calming her
in the
dark of
the warm
night,
waiting in
the driveway
for the
police to
arrive.
When they
finally do,
it's without
the fanfare of
flashing lights
or sirens.
They simply
pull up
and stop,
and take a
good four
or five
minutes to
get out
of the
patrol car.
Mrs.
Clementine?
The beam
of a
flashlight
momentarily
blinds me.
Yes?
The one
without the
flashlight
speaks now.
You called
about a
domestic
dispute?
I must
have fallen
asleep on
the sofa
earlier,
I say,
and my
husband came
home and
he's obviously
been drinking
and...
Eddie
Junior?
Yes.
He pulled
me off
the sofa,
kicked me,
and yanked
me by the
hair.
There's
something
wrong.
This
isn't
like him,
officer,
but...
No,
indeed it
isn't.
We'll
check it
out.
Thank
you.
We have
your permission
to enter
the premises?
Of
course.
Are there
any weapons
in the
home,
Mrs.
Clementine?
No.
They
enter.
I don't
hear a
sound.
A few
minutes
later,
one of
the officers
leans
out the
door.
Mrs.
Clementine,
would you
mind coming
in?
What's
wrong?
I begin
toward the
door.
Is he
all right?
The officer
doesn't reply,
so I keep
on.
I enter the
dim house
to see
Edison,
bare-chested
in plaid
pajama pants,
hair rumpled,
standing in the
kitchen.
He's
yawning.
We had
to wake
him,
one of
Parker's
landing's
finest says.
He was
upstairs in
bed,
asleep,
says he
has been
for hours.
No,
he just
came in.
I'm
sorry,
Jim.
Edison
nods at
first one
officer,
then the
other.
Ron,
she's been
having some
intense dreams
lately.
She's under
a lot of
pressure with
the move.
We
understand.
My husband
claps one on
the back and
leads them to
the door.
You're just
going to
leave?
I ask.
He kicked
me.
He pulled
me by the
hair.
Anna,
Edison
says.
Really?
You know
I wouldn't
do that.
Look,
Jim says,
there's no
sign of a
struggle,
and we
patrolled
past your
house over
an hour
ago,
and
Eddie's
car was
in the
driveway
then.
Are there
any marks
on your
body?
I doubt
there's been
time for
a bruise
to develop.
And you
said he's
been drinking,
but there's
no trace
of alcohol
on his
breath.
I can
smell the
mouthwash
from here.
He probably
just gargled
some.
Now,
you don't
have to
stay,
Mrs.
Clementine,
Jim says,
but without
evidence,
I can't
very well
arrest a
guy I've
known my
whole life,
and never
known to
have violent
tendencies.
Okay,
I'll go,
I say.
I'll take
the baby
and I'll
go.
Maybe it's
best if the
baby stays
here,
Ed says.
Might be
a good
idea,
Ron says
on their
way out
the door.
Your
husband says
you probably
need to
get some
sleep.
No amount
of convincing
will result
in my
leaving
without
Sabrina.
Thanks,
fellas.
Edison
shows them
to the
door.
A moment
later,
we're
alone,
standing
in a
kitchen
still
covered
in
cracker
crumbs.
Ed
leans
against
the
countertop.
You
want to
tell me
what's
going
on?
A
tear
rolls
down
my
cheek.
I'm
afraid,
Ed.
There's
nothing
to be
afraid
at all.
You're
just
going
through
something.
I
wish
you'd
tell
me.
I
have
told
you.
There's
something
in this
house,
but you
don't
want to
hear it.
All
you
want to
hear is
what the
busybodies
in this
town have
to say
about
Cody
Granger.
Cody.
He
sighs.
I
trust
you,
Anna,
but that
guy.
Nothing
happened.
I was
scared,
and he
was
there.
Why
is
that
so
hard
to
believe?
I'm
exhausted
and
scared,
and I'm
just
so,
so
alone.
Why
don't
you
believe
me?
Let's
table this
for now
and get
some sleep.
He
reaches
for the
baby.
She
clings
to me.
Come
on,
baby.
Ed
claps
and puts
out his
hands.
Let's
give
mommy
a
break.
But
Sabrina
only
cuddles
closer.
Zozo.
She's
afraid,
too.
Nine.
Zozo.
The
consensus
is,
I must
have
imagined
it
all.
I
must
have
smashed
an
entire
box
of
crackers
to
smithereens.
Why
I
would
have
done
such
a
thing
and
how
I
could
have
possibly
forgotten
doing
something
so
ludicrous
doesn't
seem
to
factor
into
their
ridiculous
explanation.
I
might
think
they're
right,
that I'm
under
too much
stress
to be
thinking
clearly,
but
none
of
them
can
explain
the
black
and
blue
mark
on
my
stomach
that's
roughly
the
size
of
Edison's
foot.
To
be
fair,
I
haven't
mentioned
the
bruise,
it
do.
They'll
only
rationalize
it,
say
it
happens
some
other
way,
and
make
me
feel
crazier.
Still,
the rest
of the
weekend
was
uneventful.
We
refinished
the
door
and
hung
it
at
the
attic
access.
Suddenly,
the
hallway
upstairs
came
alive,
and I
saw the
space
in the
way
it
was
meant
to
be
seen.
I
know
what
I
want
to
do.
A
bright
white
beadboard
wainscotch
and
above
it
a
rich
navy
blue
paint
on
the
walls.
Once
we
have
the
money,
I'll
bring
in
a
trim
carpenter
to
wrap
the
space
with
a
heavy
crown
molding.
We'll
paint
it
next
weekend,
Ed
says.
He's
working
from
home
this
week
so
he
can
take
care
of
me.
His
words,
not
mine.
But
it's
nice
to
have
him
home.
While
he's
working
in a
makeshift
office
in
one
of
the
upstairs
bedrooms,
I'm
unpacking
another
box.
This
one is
full of
framed
pictures
of
our
families,
which I
figure I
can place
around the
house to
make it
feel more
like
ours.
He
texts
from
upstairs.
Keep it
down?
I text
in reply.
Sorry.
I lower the
volume on
Sabrina's
show.
Zul,
Sabrina says
through her
pacifier.
She
happily
grips
a
frame
and
points
to
a
face.
Mama,
Zo!
What do
you have
there,
pumpkin?
I pull
her into
my lap
and look
at the
picture.
I
smile
when I
see
who's
in
the
picture.
Zozo!
Her
pudgy
finger
presses
to the
glass.
I
pull
the
pacifier
from
her
mouth
so I
can
hear
her
more
clearly.
Who
is
this,
Brina?
Zozo!
She
reaches
for
the
pacifier
and
stuffs
it
back
in
her
mouth.
That's
who
you're
always
talking
to?
Sabrina
nods.
Zozo!
That's
right,
I say.
My
finger's
a
little
numb.
That's
my
Aunt
Jolene.
She
was
my
favorite.
She
died
when I
was a
teenager.
I
always
called
her
Jojo.
10
Authority
Despite
the fact
that I
left the
stroller
in the
car
this
time,
Sophie
Malcolm
blinks
at me
impatiently
the moment
I enter
the
historical
society
with
Sabrina
in
my
arms.
Looking
at me
over
her
glasses,
she
says,
Your
conversation
with
your
father-in-law
didn't
go well,
I
presume?
I'm
sure you
knew
before I
arrived.
Edison's
parents
and I
don't
have
much
of
a
relationship,
but I'm
sure they,
like their
son and
the police,
assume I'm
imagining
things.
Miss
Malcolm,
I'd like
to buy
your
book.
If
you'd
mentioned
it the
first
time
we
met,
I
would
have
purchased
it
then,
and the
society's
been
closed
every
time I've
come
back
to
buy
it.
It's
out
of
print.
Then
please,
I
want to
talk to
you about
the
house.
She
opens
her
the
chance.
I've
asked
around.
I
know
you
believe
in
this
sort
of
thing.
I
need
your
help
before
something
worse
happens.
She
answers
me
with
a
steady
stare.
Please,
I don't
have
much
time.
Edison
doesn't
know
I'm
here,
he
thinks
I'm
running
an
errand,
but
for
my
daughter's
sake.
Her
gaze
trails
for a
moment
to
Sabrina.
I
suppose
we can
talk
while I
work.
She
reaches
into
a
drawer
and
extracts
the
same
notebook
that
had
occupied
her
the
last
time
I
dared
to
barge
in
on
her.
What
can I
do
for
you?
She
doesn't
offer
me a
chair,
but I
take
one
anyway,
and
prop
Sabrina
on
my
lap.
You
said
you
had
it
on
good
authority
that
the
house
on
Oak
isn't
haunted.
I
do.
If
you
don't
mind,
what
authority
is
that?
By
the
authority
of the
president
of the
historical
society.
I
glance
at the
gold
plated
label
perched
on her
desk,
identifying
her
as
the
president.
Neither
of us
says
anything
for a
moment,
the
silence
hanging
in the
air
between
us,
the
hum
of the
air
conditioner
and
the
scratch
of her
pencil
against
the
paper.
It's
all
practically
deafening.
This
town
takes
care
of its
people.
She
finally
says,
there
are
hauntings
in
Parker's
Landing,
but they
do not
occur at
the
Churchill
estate.
Well,
it's
the
Clementine
place
now,
and my
husband
is one
of you
and so
is my
daughter,
so even
if you
don't
want to
help
me,
help
them.
She
looks at
me with
a raised
brow.
Will
that
be
all?
No.
I'm
sorry if
that annoys
you,
but you
have to
know what's
been going
on.
I've
heard quite
a bit
about what's
been going
on with
you and
our town's
most eligible
bachelor.
I'm
married.
It might
serve you
well to
remember that.
I know
you don't
like me
very much.
Nonsense.
Why
wouldn't I
like you?
Because I'm
an outsider.
Because I
pushed my
stroller across
your marble
floor.
Because I
insist on
interrupting
your day.
And I'm
sorry about
all of
that.
But strange
things have
been happening
in my
house.
The house
you insist
isn't
haunted.
Her
sigh is so
exasperated,
I almost
second-guess my
decision to
come.
I'm sure
you're very
busy,
I say.
But
this morning,
my daughter
found a
picture of
my dead
Aunt Jojo,
and she
knew her
by name.
I haven't
seen the
picture in
years.
It's been
packed away
for so
long,
and it
isn't like
Ed and I
discuss my
aunt even
rarely.
She was
special to
you,
this aunt?
We were
very close.
She looked
out for you?
When I was
a little girl,
yes.
Well,
then,
let it be a
comfort to you
that she's
looking out for
your daughter
as well.
She sniffs
and glances
up from her
notebook.
But unless
she rooted
down here
at some
point or
another,
your dead
aunt has
nothing to
do with
this town.
Have a
nice day.
It doesn't
concern you
that there's
something in
the house
to warrant
protection
from?
I let it
sink in a
moment,
despite her
lack of a
reaction.
I continue.
Sabrina was
across the
room one
day.
When a
door
inexplicably
tipped over
against the
floor right
where she
was playing.
Do you
think Jolene
got her
out of
the way?
Her
chance?
But that's
nothing to
be afraid
of.
So much
as grateful
for,
now is
it?
Something
is happening
in that
house,
ever since
that one
Thursday.
Her
pencil-led
snaps.
A
Thursday?
Did you
say?
It
happens all
week?
Like a
slow build
from Monday
morning and
peaks Thursday
nights.
On the
cusp of
Friday mornings,
they're the
worst.
If you're
experiencing
something,
that's a
big if.
She clears
her throat.
These
things,
if they're
unexplained,
are usually
triggered by
an accompanying
event.
Did anything
else happen
on the
particular
Thursday when
the activity
began?
I'd
noticed a
few things
before,
nothing
outright
malicious,
but the
real trouble
began the
day I
first came
to see
you.
The
Thursday
bill began
to cut
down your
trees.
He came
to service
the trees
and remove
the rotten
ones,
yes.
You ought
to plant
fruit trees
to make
up for
those you've
taken out,
or a
cedar,
maybe.
I plan
to,
but aren't
you interested
in what
happens inside
the house?
It started
with little
things.
There's a
door in
the upstairs
hallway.
It opens
on its
own.
The color
drains from
her face.
I swallow
hard,
and even
though it's
been positively
balmy outside,
the breeze
coming down
from the
attic,
it's
frigid,
arctic,
some days.
And
Eddie?
Like I
said,
Ed doesn't
believe me.
He thinks
I'm imagining
things.
And how
is his
health?
Is he
feeling well?
Most of
the time,
but if I'm
being honest,
these days
he just,
I don't
know,
he has
moments
when he's
not quite
himself?
It seems
a breach
of marital
trust to
admit it,
but it's
true.
The bruise
on my
stomach
pricks
with pain
just then.
Miss
Malcolm,
what do
you think,
my dear?
That old
catalpa
tree,
did it
come down?
What is
it with
this woman
and trees?
If
Parker's
Landing has
statutes about
tree removal
and replacement,
they ought to
be published.
Of course I
took it
down,
it was
rotten,
I explain,
and we're
going to
plant new
trees just
as soon
as you
dug up
the roots.
Small
towns,
everyone has
to know
everyone's
business.
Yes,
I rake
through
Sabrina's
hair,
brush it
from her
forehead.
The old
woman offers
a curt,
if not
reluctant,
nod.
It's
the most
gorgeous
door,
she says.
I
freeze.
An
original,
she says.
A
five-panel
masterpiece
with an
iron
grate.
At
the top,
I
confirm.
You've
seen it.
Oh,
I've
seen it,
all right.
Her
voice is
practically a
whisper.
I'll
never
forget
that
door.
What do
you know
about it?
She
stands,
so I
stand.
I'm the
one who
ordered that
door to
be buried
under that
tree.
My heart
bottoms out
in my
gut.
It wasn't
an accident.
The door
wound up in
the ground
very purposefully.
But
why?
You
unearthed
quite a bit
more than
a door,
Mrs.
Clementine.
11.
Edison.
Tell me
what I'm
dealing
with.
The airy
foyer of
the historical
society is
as cold
and silent
as the
matron in
charge of
it,
uncomfortable
in every
aspect,
but I
don't
budge.
The door,
it's back
inside the
house,
Ms.
Malcolm
asks.
I'm a
restoration
specialist,
like I
said.
I want the
house to be
all it
used to
be.
My phone
pings with
the text
from Ed.
Trying to
work.
Ed,
turn down
Sabrina's
music.
I turn the
music off
before we
left.
I return.
We're not
home yet.
Ed.
Ha ha.
He thinks
I'm kidding.
Ed.
Turn.
Ed.
It.
Ed.
Down.
Something is
happening in
the house.
It happened
in the 70s,
but it
doesn't happen
anymore.
Sophie Malcolm's
stare is far
away, as if
she's looking
beyond me.
into the
distant past.
A perfectly
respectable
man, a
Churchill, no
less, turned
into something
no one
recognized.
He'd never
had trouble
with the
drink, but
suddenly couldn't
stop.
I think of
the dozens of
wine bottles I
cleared from the
crawlspace, and
I imagine a
faceless Churchill
guzzling down
alcohol and
chucking bottles
where no one
could find
them.
Ed is
drinking, too.
Believe it or
not, before we
moved here, I
rarely saw him
take a sip.
The trouble
began with
the renovation.
My throat
tightens.
We're planning to
undergo a major
rehauling of the
place in the next
few years.
I wonder if I
jump-started
trouble myself.
When you begin
to disrupt
what's been
sleeping for
decades, she
continues, there's
no foretelling
its mood when
it awakens.
When what
awakens?
She leans
toward me.
Mrs.
Clementine,
listen to me.
You and your
daughter.
It's residual,
an imprint of
history left in
the air of that
place.
It's not
there, not
real.
It happened
once, but you
must refuse to
believe it's
happening again.
By reacting,
you're giving it
permission to
persist.
An icy chill
darts through my
veins.
I press a kiss
to the top of my
daughter's head and
hold her a little
closer.
I said the
house isn't
haunted, she
says, but I
didn't say it
had never been.
There hasn't
been any
activity since
the bicentennial,
since the
churchills called
on me to bury
the trouble.
What did you
do to bury it?
My phone
buzzes with
another text.
Turn down
that damn
music!
I closed
the door on
it, so to
speak.
Churchill
succumbed to
violent episodes
when he drank,
Miss Malcolm
says as she
walks through the
historical center
lobby, turning
off the lights
in display
cases.
Always built
up all week
and hit the
height on
Thursday.
Has Eddie
ever hurt you?
Or the
child?
tears well
in my eyes.
I sniffle
and confirm
with a single
nod.
I can't go
through that
every Thursday.
It will
only get
worse if
you don't
stand your
ground.
She pulls
a book
from one
shelf, then
meanders to
the next
shelf over.
But
whatever's
in the
house, you
took care
of it once
before.
Will you
help me
take care
of it again,
Miss Malcolm?
I'll help
the house
as best I
can.
Her lips
pucker, and
her glance
travels over
me from top
to bottom
and back
again.
But
whatever you
allow to
happen inside
the house,
the changes
you must
make, only
you can
help that.
Can you
tell me
why?
Why is
this happening?
What awakened
this, this
whatever it
was in the
70s, why
is it
stirring
now?
She pulls
another book,
this one
small and
leather, from
a shelf.
I won't
betray the
church hills,
and casually
drops both
books on the
small table
near the
door.
Good day,
Mrs.
Clementine.
Her back
is turned to
me as I
near the
door,
purposefully,
as if she
doesn't want
to watch
me take
the books,
although that's
clearly what
she intends.
I scoop
them up as
I leave.
After I get
Sabrina buckled
into her car
seat, I see
that the first
book is none
other than the
one Ms.
Malcolm penned.
I scan over
the table of
contents, then
flip to the
section concerning
the churchills.
The house was
built in
1898.
My finger
rapidly follows
the typewritten
lines until
my eye catches
something I
didn't know.
Churchill, the
town's first
lawyer, left
in December
of 1918 for
an event in
the state
capital.
He never
returned.
It was
presumed he
lost his way
in the ensuing
blizzard and
died of
exposure.
His Model
T was never
recovered.
I open the
next book,
which appears
to be a
journal.
The first
page boasts,
in flourishing
handwriting, that
the book belongs
to Mrs.
Richard Churchill.
I scan through
the pages, all
handwritten, but
thoroughly read
only bits and
pieces.
Richard is out
again.
I do wish he'd
spend some time
with the children
and me.
Richard can't
imagine how
lonely I am in
this godforsaken
town.
A girl has
to talk to
someone, hasn't
she?
He refuses to
listen to reason,
won't hear a bit
of the truth.
We're in this
predicament because
he's forever
leaving me on my
own.
Richard has
barricaded us
in.
I informed him
of my intention
to take the
children away,
and he is
keeping us
prisoners here.
I might lose
my mind.
This afternoon's
wedding celebration
carried on well
into the night,
and not a soul
asked of my
whereabouts, or
the children's.
And the last
entry.
He has left
town.
I suspect we'll
never see him
again.
I slam the
cover shut.
It seems this
house has a
history of
usurpation and
abuse, a past
as ugly as its
current decor, and
Sophie Malcolm
insists it's
being stirred up
again, because
I'm giving it
permission.
Edison texts
again.
Where are you?
Please come
home.
I suppose I can't
avoid going back to
the house on Oak
forever, but I
take the long way
home, through
town, past the
Crescent Moon
Cafe, where Cody
Granger waves as he
exits.
The town is
quaint at first
glance.
Its secrets are
buried beneath the
surface.
Will even my
husband tell me the
truth about what
happened here so
long ago?
Or is it possible
it's such a firmly
guarded secret that
even he doesn't
know?
I pull up to the
house.
I get out of the
car and open the
back door to unbuckle
Sabrina.
I hesitate, my
hands going still
on the straps of
the baby seat, but
then gather her
into my arms and
remember what
Sophie Malcolm
said.
It's residual.
The energy in the
house isn't real.
We can't let it
influence us.
We can't be hurt
if we don't react.
I walk into the
house, which is
dark.
All the curtains
are drawn.
Ed?
I pull a drape
aside, and a beam
of sunlight illuminates
a path to the
dining room, where
Edison sits at the
table, his back to
the door.
Anna.
His head is in his
hands, and he
appears to be
sobbing.
His shoulders
shake.
I reach for him,
place a hand on
his shoulder.
There's a kitchen
knife on the
table, and while he
isn't touching it, I
assume it's there
because he's scared.
He saw something,
heard something,
felt something he
couldn't explain.
Maybe now he'll
believe me.
Ed?
He looks up at me,
grinning a maniacal
grin.
Laughing, not crying.
I take a step back.
Sabrina huddles
closer and
murmurs,
Zoe.
Come upstairs.
His laughter
sends shivers up the
back of my neck.
I want to show you
what's in the attic.
No, I think we
should just,
come on.
For every step he
takes toward me,
I take another back.
No.
Anna?
He's closer now,
even as I stumble
backward.
I'm the head of this
household, and I
said no.
What did you say?
His fingers close
around my biceps.
Sabrina wails,
and in a flash,
I'm tumbling down,
clutching my child,
screaming.
In an instant,
everything is black.
12.
Emerging.
Sabrina?
My head aches
at the temples,
and the light is so
bright, it's difficult
to open my eyes.
But the last thing
I remember flashes
in my brain.
Edison.
The knife on the
table.
The attic.
And I sit up
with a gasp.
Sabrina!
All right.
It's all right.
The voice is deep.
Male.
I've got her.
I blink hard,
and when I manage
to focus,
I see my daughter,
resting her head
on Cody Granger's
shoulder,
asleep.
There's a quilt
covering me.
I throw it off.
No, no, no.
When I try to stand,
I teeter and fall
back to the sofa
and try again.
We have to get home.
This, God,
this doesn't look good.
How did we get here?
Amid my confusion,
details of the house
begin to register.
Doilies,
draped over the
backs of chairs.
Lace curtains.
Statuettes,
lining the shelves
of the credenza.
This is not the home
of a bachelor.
We're at
Miss Malcolm's house,
Cody says.
Where's Edison?
I reach for my daughter.
Is he all right?
Cody places
Sabrina in my arms.
He's with Sophie
at your place.
The look in his eyes,
I say.
I swear he was
going to...
I shut up.
I can't say it,
even if it's true.
I can't admit
I think my husband
is capable of
killing me.
I wish
someone would
believe me.
I do.
He looks down
at his hands
for a moment,
then meets my gaze.
That night,
at the depot,
he was...
different,
somehow.
Different enough
for me to be concerned.
And after what you said,
I've been checking on you
every once in a while.
I slept in my truck
down the road
a piece one night,
and this afternoon,
you looked so scared
when you passed
the crescent moon.
I went to check on you
again this afternoon.
You saw what happened?
I saw he was about
to push you around
a little,
and I wasn't about
to let that happen.
You saved us?
No, ma'am.
I just stepped between you
and you fainted.
Your husband seemed
to come to his senses then,
and he agreed
we should call
Miss Malcolm.
It was she
who suggested
I bring you
and the baby here
until she had time
to sort things out
with Eddie.
I wish
someone would tell me
what's in that house.
You dated
one of the
Churchill daughters.
You must know
something.
I know the town's
first lawyer
disappeared,
he offers.
Everybody knows that.
That's published
for God's sake.
Everyone also thinks
there's more
to the story.
That he suspected
his wife of having
an affair
and locked her
in the attic.
The journal
Miss Malcolm
had slipped to me
suggested the same.
The chill
whipping down
from the attic stairs
revisits me now,
and I shudder
with the thought
of being a prisoner
in my own home.
Everyone assumes
the old man
didn't really disappear.
But once she managed
to escape the attic,
she took care
of the problem.
Meaning,
she killed
her husband?
No one knows.
But there's
evidence left.
His car
was never recovered.
This was
the early 1900s.
How difficult
would it be
to unload a vehicle
without keeping
a record of it?
If the energy
in the house,
as Sophie insists,
is on repeat,
and Edison
is reenacting
what once happened there,
I wonder if
whatever is in
the house
is retaliating,
avenging the lawyer's
mysterious disappearance
or death.
But I asked you
about the house,
and you said
nothing strange
happened there,
I say.
Why wouldn't you
tell me all this
then?
I told you
I never
experienced
anything strange,
and that's true.
I wasn't about
to fill your head
with ghost stories.
You live
in an old
spooky house,
primarily alone,
I might add.
What kind of friend
would I be
if I scared you
unnecessarily?
Friend?
He nods.
Yes,
Anastasia.
I'd like to think
we're friends.
His phone
buzzes,
but he maintains
eye contact
with me.
Ed says you
stole his
high school
girlfriend.
Yeah.
He checks
his phone.
That was
a long time
ago,
and you
ought to
thank me
for that.
He might
have married
her otherwise.
I don't
know about
that,
but thank
you,
I say,
for being
there today.
That was
Miss Malcolm.
He holds
up his phone.
She's ready
for you.
Thirteen.
Burial
site.
With Sophie
Malcolm to
my left,
Edison to
my right,
and Sabrina
asleep in
my arms,
I stare at
the freshly
dug-out
rectangular
patch of
earth.
What do we
do?
We could
live with
my parents,
Edison says,
just for a
while,
until things
settle down.
A bandage
on a gunshot
wound,
Sophie Malcolm
says.
It's already
begun to
influence you.
Who knows
how attached
it might be
to you
already?
We have
to bury
that entity.
Close the
door on it.
I'll be
glad to put
this to rest,
Edison says.
Bill's crew
lowers the
door into
the rectangular
plot in the
yard,
where the
catalpa tree
used to grow.
This is
just the
beginning,
Sophie says,
smudging the
house with
white sage,
drawing out
all the
evil.
What sins
Churchill awakened
in this place
at the
Bicentennial,
even I
can't tell
you.
But I
know for
certain you
awakened it
again.
And burying
this door and
planting a
fruit tree atop
it isn't
going to
immediately fix
the trouble.
You'll have
to work
very hard
to appease
the house,
to bring
enough good
into it
to overshadow
the bad.
If you
leave,
the bad
leaves with
you.
If you
stay,
you and
the house
have a
fighting
chance.
We'll make
it work.
Edison
closes a
hand around
mine.
I drop
my head
to his
shoulder
and watch
as the
backhoe
pushes the
dirt over
the beautiful
door.
Sophie
whispers prayers
of banishment.
May the
door that
once imprisoned
the Churchill
family now
hold whatever
evil resides
within the
walls of
this house.
May all
malicious
creatures be
restrained with
the door now
shut upon
them.
If you
leave,
the bad
leaves with
you.
If you
stay,
you and
the house
have a
fighting
chance.
I breathe
in the
scent of
the earth
and imagine
the house
in its
glorified
renovated
state.
The dream
can be
ours,
all of
it.
I imagine
Sabrina running
through the
fields with
baby brothers
and sisters
laughing and
playing.
Edison,
shooting baskets
on the
driveway once
we install
a hoop.
Tilt-out
flower bins
and glass
door cabinets
in the
kitchen,
where we'll
cook together
every Sunday.
Holiday
mornings by
the fireplace,
sharing coffee
and pastries.
I see the
dream.
That's the
life I want.
It's what we
envisioned when
we decided to
take the plunge
and purchase
this place.
But then
an eerie
sensation
creeps in
like a
cold finger
on the
back of
my neck
just as
I'm about
to settle
into this
safe and
lackadaisical
feeling.
And another
picture flashes
in my mind.
A rectangular
plot of
earth,
my child
screaming
with grief
and a
headstone
with my
name on
it.
I pull
away,
but Edison
only tightens
his grip.
We'll make
a life here,
won't we,
Anna?
He smiles the
smile I've seen
only since we
moved to
Parker's Landing
and squeezes
my hand even
more tightly.
I'm looking
forward to
it.
