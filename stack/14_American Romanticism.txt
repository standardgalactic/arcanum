By 1815, the Enlightenment had come to an intellectual dead end.
Its greatest political achievement was the American Revolution,
but that achievement had to be balanced off against the horrors of the American Revolution's bloody sibling,
the French Revolution, and the military tyranny of Napoleon Bonaparte that followed it.
The Enlightenment's greatest scientific achievements brought the natural world under the mastery of humanity.
But humanity then turned and converted that mastery into smoke-belching factories,
cheap mass production of goods, and the swollen wealth of a new ruling class, the bourgeoisie.
Disenchantment with these shortfallings had been a long time a-borning.
In 1790, the Englishman Edmund Burke was jolted awake by the French Revolution
to the unsteadiness of founding politics purely on human reason.
In his reflections on the revolution in France, Burke insisted that human minds were too limited and too prone to error
to question political institutions which had been developed over centuries of experience.
The political theorists of the Enlightenment looked upon humanity as a universal quantity.
All men, not just Englishmen, not just Americans, all men came from the hand of their creator, as Jefferson said,
with certain inalienable rights, and these rights were so rational and so rationally comprehended
that they could be encoded in written and reasonable constitutions.
But looking out over the wreckage of the French Revolution, and then later of Napoleon's empire,
this seemed like drivel.
There is no such thing as man in the world, the revolutionary exile, Joseph de Maistre, sneered.
During my life I have seen Frenchmen, Italians, Russians, and so on,
but I must say, as for man, I've never come across him anywhere.
Every nation's individual experience made its people what they were,
not some mysterious fundamental human qualities or rights.
And taking de Maistre one step further, Arthur de Gobineau,
in his essay on the inequality of the human races, published in four volumes between 1853 and 1855,
Gobineau located those unbridgeable differences,
not just in nationality or national history and experience,
but in the biology of races.
But it wasn't just Enlightenment politics which seemed to underscore the follies of reason.
In his inquiry into the origins of the sublime,
Burke turned an essay in art criticism
into a defiant rejection of the Enlightenment's entire epistemological commitment
to the supremacy of reason.
The dominant artistic mood of the Enlightenment, like its politics,
was classical,
a term that included precision, clarity, proportion, light,
calmness, and neatly trimmed corners.
This made absolutely no sense whatsoever to Edmund Burke.
What art should strive to capture was not reason and balance,
but excitement, passion,
and, his key word,
the sublime.
A word that Burke packed full
of all the fearful and monstrous
and mysterious qualities,
sometimes superstitious qualities,
which the Enlightenment had tried to banish
from the human imagination.
What was the sublime?
It was composed, Burke said,
of astonishment,
terror,
obscurity,
power,
privation,
vacuity,
darkness,
solitude,
and silence,
vastness,
infinity,
succession,
and uniformity,
magnificence,
light,
color,
magnitude,
and building,
and difficulty.
It's almost impossible to specify
when this attack on Enlightenment reason
became known as
romanticism,
but by 1820 it was in full swing
and it was calling for a vast redefinition
of what the Enlightenment thought it was talking about
when it spoke about reason and nature.
Sound and fury aside,
the Romantics had seen
the same fundamental problem
with the power of reason
that the Scottish common sense philosophers
had seen in Locke and Hume.
The Scots tried to outflank skepticism
by proposing that minds
are not, in fact,
dependent on each individual's sensations
to discover truth.
Instead, minds discover truth
by apprehending
and then having reality
presented directly to them.
But a much more influential reply
to Hume
and behind Hume
to Locke
came from the German philosopher
Immanuel Kant
in his Critique of Pure Reason
published in 1781.
According to Kant,
Locke and Hume
were right
in at least one respect.
The data
presented to the mind
by the senses
was indeed
a valid source of knowledge.
The problem with Locke and Hume
was that it was not
the only one.
The mind
possessed
active powers
of its own
and it used those powers
to impose
order
on the data
it received.
Now up to this point,
it sounds very much
as though Kant
was echoing
the response
that the Scottish
common sense philosophers
had had to Locke and to Hume.
However,
unlike the Scots,
Kant insisted
that minds
did not
directly apprehend
the external world.
That was not
the cure
for skepticism.
However,
Kant then went on
to add
unlike Locke
and Hume,
the mind
was also
not merely
a passive recipient
of sensation.
Certainly,
it was not
a starveling
that could know
nothing but what
the senses fed it.
Minds,
said Kant,
contain certain
inbuilt
categories.
And while these categories
are not
knowledge per se,
every sensation
that comes
the way
of the mind
gets handled,
processed,
and organized
by these categories
so that
sense
is made
of what would
otherwise be
just a random
accumulation of data
laid on the
mind's doorstep.
In this way,
knowledge about
the external world
really does rely
on the senses
and is not
apprehended
directly.
But,
the mind
was an active
partner
in the creation
of knowledge
in ways
that had
nothing to do
with mere reason.
Kant
disliked
being associated
with romanticism,
but in fact,
he had done it
a pretty considerable
epistemological service.
he had shown
that Hume
was wrong.
The real world
existed
and we sensed it
and skepticism
about that
was just folly
and talk.
The problem
was,
however,
that the knowledge
we derived
from the senses
was nothing
more than that.
It was just
sensation.
And mere reason
was helpless
to penetrate
farther
into the essence
of the
thing
in itself
that might
have caused
that sensation.
At best,
descriptions
of external
reality,
so far as
they were based
on sensation,
were purely
phenomenal.
In other words,
they were concerned
with mere
phenomena,
mere data.
And phenomena
tell us nothing
about whether
they are
inalienable rights
or whether
God exists.
And that was
the point
on which Hume
thought he'd
won the game.
But Kant
countered
that there is
another realm
of knowledge
available to the
mind
which does
allow us
to see
into the nature
of things
in themselves.
There was
a noumenal
realm.
And it was
in the noumenal
that an
understanding
of the thing
in itself,
of God,
of moral
right and wrong
existed.
Now because
it was
noumenal
and not
phenomenal,
mere reason
could not
operate there.
Reason was
designed only
to operate
on the
phenomenal.
Reason could
never become
transcendent.
But,
just as the
mind possessed
categories
beyond mere
reason,
it also
possessed
an understanding
which was
beyond
mere reason.
And it was
the understanding
which opened
access by
intuition
to the
noumenal.
There were,
Kant said,
two things
which amazed
him.
The starry
heavens above
which were
phenomenal
and the
moral law
within
which belonged
to the
noumenal.
And never
the twain
would meet,
at least
methodologically.
Philosophy
could not
become
transcendent.
But,
through the
gift of
the noumenal,
it could
become
transcendental.
Reason,
with all
of its
limitations,
its
half-heartedness,
its sterility,
reason could
retire off
the stage.
And minds
could rejoice
in knowing the
certainty of
external phenomena
and the
intuition of
transcendental
wonder.
the French
revolution
confirmed
the suspicions
of the
romantics
about
reason
and the
enlightenment.
But,
on the other
hand,
the American
revolution
embarrassed the
romantics
because the
American
revolution,
based as it
was on
reason,
looked like it
was succeeding
quite well.
Thank you.
And so,
the European
romantics
turned the
full force
of their
scorn
on the
American
exception,
to their
rule.
The romantics
could not
deny that
the American
republic,
with its
optimistic
universalism
about natural
rights,
with its
neat little
constitution,
seeming to
embody the
enlightenment,
and not
merely to be
surviving,
but in fact
prospering,
they could not
deny any of
this,
but they
could,
and they
did,
assert that
its success
was shallow.
There was no
real national
identity in
America,
complained the
romantics.
Americans were
a cheap
mixture of
races and
nationalities,
united solely
by the hope
of materialistic
gain.
Dollars and
cents,
the ultimate
rational
calculation.
The American
knows nothing.
He seeks
nothing but
money.
He has no
ideas,
raged the
German poet
Niklaus
Lenau.
America was,
wrote Heinrich
Heine,
a gigantic
prison of
freedom.
Sometimes it
comes to my
mind,
said Heine,
to sail to
America,
to that
pigpen of
freedom,
inhabited by
boors living
in equality.
And there
were more
than a few
Americans by
the 1820s
who were
inclined to
agree with
that judgment.
Thomas
Jefferson was
preeminently
the American
man of
reason.
But his
political
allegiance to
an anti-mercantile
agriculturalism
and the need
he felt to
justify slave
holding on
the grounds
of the
racial inferiority
of slaves
constantly pulled
him in romantic
directions,
reason and
enlightenment
notwithstanding.
Jonathan
Edwards had
hoped to
resist the
flattening of
religious
authority by
appealing to
the religious
affections as
a sufficiently
valid justification
for Protestant
Calvinism.
Like Kant,
Edwards would
have deplored
any connection
of his
critique of
reason with
Romanticism's
wholesale revolt
against it,
but the
ongoing influence
of evangelical
revivalism,
set by the
pattern of
the Great
Awakening,
certainly gave
instant credit
to anyone
proposing on
religious grounds
to criticize
or diminish
the supremacy
of reason
in knowledge
and giving
pride of
place not
to the
intellect but
to the
will.
That old
problem comes
back and
haunts us.
The first
serious thinker
to see the
power of
Romantic
thinking to
energize
theology beyond
the familiar
categories of
Edwards or
the Puritans
was James
Marsh, a
Vermont
Edwardsian who
was appointed
president of
the Infant
University of
Vermont in
October of
1826.
Marsh felt
altogether
dissatisfied with
the old method
of the Scotch and
English philosophers
which he thought
too formal,
cold, and
barren.
And in 1821 he
began his first
study of
Kant.
This blossomed in
1829 when
Marsh published
an American
edition of
Kant's foremost
English language
popularizer, the
English poet
Samuel Taylor
Coleridge's
Aids to
Reflection.
Marsh's own
writings are an
odd blend of
Edward's Ian
rhetoric and
Kantian ideas.
On the one
hand, he
taught that the
material of thought
is an intuition
and antecedent to
the act of
knowing, which
in Kant's terms
would have meant
that the
categories exist
prior to the
data the senses
provide to the
mind.
But the material
that Marsh
believed existed
prior to
sensation was
original sin.
There's a
category for you.
A root of
bitterness, a
principle of
evil that
vitiates all
his actions.
Well, Marsh
died in
1842, believing
that Kant and
his followers are
very little known
in this country.
But Marsh
underestimated the
ease with which
German immigrants
to America and
American theological
students who
migrated to
Europe to
master the
latest methods
in biblical
scholarship could
slowly turn
American attention
in Kantian and
romantic directions.
Marsh particularly
underestimated the
impact he had on
the thin-aired
circle of Boston
Unitarianism through
one of the gems in
the Unitarian
diadem, Ralph
Waldo Emerson.
Born in
1803, Emerson
matriculated at
Harvard at age
14.
He read through
the usual collegiate
curriculum, which
included Thomas
Reed, graduated in
1821, taught in a
girls' school, and
then in 1825, entered
the new Harvard
Divinity School, a
novelty in higher
education that
proposed to move
training for
ordination out of
the hands of
individual pastors in
their studies, like
Hopkins and Bellamy
and Emmons, and
into a professionalized
academic context.
Poor health kept
Emerson dropping in
and out of school,
school, but in
January of 1829,
Boston's second
church, where
Cotton Mather had
been the pastor a
century before,
called Emerson as
its junior pastor.
This was the same
year that Emerson
began reading
Marsh's edition of
Coleridge.
And two years
later, Emerson made
a pilgrimage to
Vermont to meet
Marsh.
The experience
purged Emerson of
anything, like
loyalty to
Christianity, even
in its milder and
starchier Unitarian
form.
I regard it as
the irresistible
effect of the
Copernican astronomy
to have made the
theological scheme of
redemption absolutely
incredible, he wrote
in 1832.
In the world of the
phenomenal, there
could be no trace of
the transcendental.
And so he resigned
from a ministry that
he believed had sold
its soul to the
phenomenal, to
facts, to the
external realities, to
reason, to logic, to
argument, to
catechisms.
Emerson took a
sabbatical to Europe,
met Coleridge, and
even more important,
met the Scottish
romantic Thomas
Carlyle, whose
career as an
independent writer and
essayist became the
model that Emerson
aspired to.
When he returned in
1833, Emerson
stumbled across an
article in the
Unitarian newspaper,
The Christian
Examiner, by
Frederick Hedge on
Coleridge and
Kant, appealing for
a new division of
epistemology into
natural philosophy and
transcendental
philosophy.
That drove Emerson to
conclude that
reason is the
highest faculty of
the soul, but it
never reasons, never
approves, it
simply perceives.
The
understanding, and
here we have that
Kantian distinction
coming into play, the
understanding toils all
the time, compares,
contrives, adds,
argues, nearsighted but
strong-sighted, dwelling in
the present, the
expedient, the
customary.
In October of 1834,
Emerson moved to
Concord, Massachusetts,
able to live
comfortably, though
not elegantly, from
the estate of his
first wife, Ellen
Tucker Emerson, who
had died in 1831.
There, in Concord, he
began work on the
brief book which
would become his
manifesto, Nature,
which he published in
1836.
With the publication
of Nature,
Kantian epistemology
and romantic
sensibility arrived in
America with a bang.
In this, Emerson had
three propositions to
make.
First, the complete
complementarity of
humanity and nature.
As opposed to his
Calvinist forebears in
New England, nature was
not a mere physical
theater in which men
struggled with their
sinful nature to find
redemption and grace.
Nor was nature what
the Enlightenment had
made it into, an
interesting but inert
field to be plowed up
for a human experiment
and profit.
Rather, nature was the
counterpart and mate
of the soul.
The greatest delight
which the field and
woods minister is the
suggestion of an
occult relation between
man and the vegetable,
Emerson wrote.
I am not alone and
unacknowledged.
They nod to me and
I to them.
Nature can certainly
offer humanity
commodities, but much
more important than
offering commodities,
nature offered men
beauty, a model of
virtue, the formation
of taste without any
mixture, as Emerson put
it, of corporeal
benefit.
The second element
of Emerson's nature is
the displacement of
reason.
How nature delivered
all of these gifts to
Emerson might have been
something of a question
because nature does not
present its beauties with
appropriate explanatory
subtitles.
But this, for Emerson,
was to look at the
problem from exactly the
wrong perspective.
Nature is not defective
for lacking a language.
We are defective for
relying on something as
freakish as language to
explain nature.
What are words, Emerson
asked?
Not propositions,
precisely stating truth,
like certain inalienable
rights.
Rather, language, words,
they are simply signs of
natural facts.
And every natural fact is
itself a symbol of some
spiritual fact.
By waiting for language and
for words to deliver
truth, we've missed the
truth being symbolized
all around us by nature.
Who looks upon a river in
a meditative hour and is
not reminded of the flux of
all things, Emerson asked?
Philosophers and theologians
build huge pyramids of
words, definitions,
questions, propositions,
as though the words were
real and true in
themselves, when in fact
all words are simply
metaphors for natural
objects.
Intuition, not definition,
leads us to truth.
Or, in an economic
analogy that Andrew
Jackson's war on the bank
of the United States must
have made quite stimulating
for Emerson's readers,
a paper currency is
employed when we use words
when there is no bullion
in the vaults.
The third element in
Emerson's nature was the
naturalization of religion.
Religion and ethics,
Emerson complained,
usually end up degrading
nature and suggesting its
dependence on spirit.
Well, this happens whenever
a religion divides nature
from grace and promotes
the importance of grace
over that of nature.
Emerson would have none of
it.
I have no hostility to
nature, but a child's
love to it.
God refuses to be recorded
in propositions.
The happiest man is the
one who learns from nature
the lessons of worship.
Emerson's book, Nature,
amounted to less than a
hundred pages, all told,
but it sold well when it was
published in early September
1836.
That same month,
Emerson, Henry Hedge,
George Putnam, and George
Ripley met in Cambridge to
organize a philosophical
club.
Its membership never exceeded
17, but it eventually
included Orestes Bronson
and Bronson Alcott.
And after Emerson wrote a
manifesto for the group
entitled The Transcendentalist,
from the use of that term,
he explained, by Immanuel
Kant of Königsberg, who
replied to the skeptical
philosophy of Locke, the
name Transcendentalist stuck
permanently to them.
In 1840, the
Transcendentalists founded a
magazine, The Dial, which
would become the bulletin
board for their ideas.
For all that Emerson preached
harmony with nature, he
could not resist shooting
barbs into the hides of his
fellow New Englanders.
Not too much harmony there
with them.
In 1837, the Phi Beta
Kappa Society at Harvard
invited Emerson to give its
annual address.
And Emerson responded with,
the American scholar, which
turned out not to be about
American scholarship at all,
but really about Emerson's
contempt for finding truth
in books.
Meek young men, he said,
grow up in libraries,
believing it their duty to
accept the views which
Cicero, which Locke, which
Bacon have given.
Forgetful that Cicero, Locke,
and Bacon were only young men
in libraries when they wrote
these books.
The purpose of a book,
said Emerson, is to inspire,
not inform, to simulate
action, not merely to offer
truth on a platter.
Character is higher than
intellect, he warned.
And the burden of the scholar
is to cheer, to raise, and to
guide men, not lecture to
them.
The Phi Beta Kappens were
delighted.
And the next year, the Harvard
Divinity School's senior class
invited Emerson to speak to
them, which he did,
describing historical
Christianity as hopelessly
dull and corrupt, and the
Bible as lacking epical
integrity.
Not maybe the wisest thing to
say in the confines of a
theological seminary.
The faculty of the Divinity
School was not amused.
Emerson was not invited back to
Harvard for another 30 years.
Emerson, however, was a
comparatively mild rebel when he
was set beside the other
Transcendentalists.
Bronson Alcott bankrupted
himself trying to prop up an
experimental school built around
Transcendentalist principles in
Concord.
The impetuous feminist,
Margaret Fuller, whom Emerson
recruited to edit the Dial in
1840, caused a sensation in
1847 when she left for Italy to
report on the Italian Revolution
for the New York Tribune, and
bore a child out of wedlock with
an Italian nobleman.
George Ripley organized a
Transcendentalist commune at
Brook Farm in 1841, and Alcott
imitated him with another commune
at Fruitlands in 1844, which
lasted only seven months.
Henry David Thoreau, a Concord
native whom Emerson met in 1837,
when Thoreau was still a senior at
Harvard, got himself jailed when he
refused to pay taxes for the
Mexican War.
Repulsed by the crassness of
liberal democracy, Thoreau organized
his own one-man commune on the
shore of Concord's Walden Pond.
And his reflective monologue on that
retreat, Walden, was a bleak
jeremiad on the human costs of a
modern commercial society.
Emerson, by contrast, with these
more radical Transcendentalists,
actually remained aloof from
talking about social causes.
Not until the 1850s did Emerson even
involve himself in opposition to
slavery.
I have quite other slaves to free
than those Negroes, Emerson wrote,
to wit, imprisoned spirits,
imprisoned thoughts.
By the time, though, that he actually
did get around to joining the
anti-slavery chorus, Emerson's
creativity was already beginning to
gutter.
He had become something of an
institution in himself.
He was a widely celebrated lecturer,
an essayist, even a poet.
But one that, after the 1850s, had
increasingly little that was new to
say.
Nature remained his only sustained
philosophical work, and the bulk of
his intellectual energies went into
the writing of the two great series of
essays, which he published in 1841 and
1844.
Nevertheless, Emerson's public audience
was and remains substantial.
Much of what Emerson wrote now seems
trivial, bloated, and insubstantial.
When Charles Dickens asked what
transcendentalism was, he wrote,
I was given to understand that
whatever was unintelligible would
be certainly transcendental.
But the impact of Emerson's criticism of
Lockean empiricism and New England
theology, all of this was a profound
shock to American minds before the
Civil War.
Set against the Puritan confidence in
the power of words to establish and
useful, to establish useful and real
distinctions.
Set even against Jonathan Edwards'
sureness that the appropriate
arrangement of terms like inability and
necessity could force acceptance and
action.
Set against those, Emerson appears
dangerous, radical, and subversive.
But for whom?
For the most part, Emerson had not one,
but two audiences.
The first audience was composed of
people like himself, who had lost their
trust in the ability of religious
language to convey accuracy or truth,
and who were relieved that terms like
grace, depravity, or hell no longer had to
be wrestled with as real.
His other audience was composed of
people who really wanted to continue
believing in the old religious
verities, and who thought that turning
old religious language into metaphors
was a way to keep them alive.
Both of those audiences were looking for
comfort and for relief, more than for
truth.
Emerson's emptying language of
meaning suited the flight from
truth, but it also emptied language of
its power.
And that, in the long run, was a
profoundly anti-intellectual stance.
He detested, as he put it, books written
by the dead for the dead.
It never occurred to him that his own
writings might, and could, be construed in
the same way.
