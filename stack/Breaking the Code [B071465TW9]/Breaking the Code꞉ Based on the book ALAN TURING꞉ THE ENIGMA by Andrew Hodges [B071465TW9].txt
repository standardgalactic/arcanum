Breaking the Code by Hugh Whitemore, starring Simon Templeman, directed by Rosalind Ayres,
recorded before an audience by L.A. Theatre Works.
Mathematical genius Alan Turing saved England by cracking the Nazi Enigma Code
and was hailed publicly by Winston Churchill as a national hero.
Years later, a petty theft in Turing's home prompts a string of events
leading to the British government's efforts to destroy him for the criminal offense of homosexuality.
A smash hit on both sides of the Atlantic,
Hugh Whitemore's elegant drama plunges us into the fascinating world of mathematics
and a society still governed by the Code of Silence.
And now, Breaking the Code by Hugh Whitemore.
Sorry to keep you waiting, sir. Sit down. Make yourself comfortable.
Well, now, let's get the basic facts sorted out.
We're talking about a burglary that occurred on January the 23rd,
and you are Mr. Sperling?
No. Turing.
Beg your pardon?
My name is Turing, not Sperling.
Sorry, sir. Beg your pardon.
It's bloody illiterate than some of our young police constables.
Just look at this atrocious writing.
It could be Sperling, spilling, tilling.
Well, it's Turing. T-U-R-I-N-G.
Alan Matheson Turing. Is that right?
Yes.
Right.
Mick Ross, Detective Sergeant.
How do you do?
How do you do, sir?
You live at Holymead Adlington Road, Wilmslow?
Yes.
And you work at Manchester University?
Yes.
So it's Professor Turing.
Mr. Turing is perfectly adequate.
Right.
Not a native North Countryman?
No.
No, I thought not.
How long have you been here?
Four years.
Since 1948.
It's an unusual name.
Turing.
Don't think I've come across it before.
Scottish.
Ah.
Whereabouts?
I'm sorry?
Whereabouts in Scotland do you come from?
No.
I, um, the Turings are of Scottish descent.
Oh, I see.
They came to England some time ago.
Before you were born?
In the 7th century, or so I think.
Right.
Now, sir, this burglary.
Can you tell me exactly what happened?
Well, as I explained to the police constable, I got back home on Wednesday evening and found
that the house had been broken into.
Yes?
Well, I telephoned the police and then I made a list of what was missing, of what seemed
to be missing.
Is this your list?
Yes.
A shirt, five fish knives, a pair of tweed trousers, three pairs of shoes, a compass,
an electric shaver, and a half-empty bottle of sherry.
It's not much of a haul.
No, I don't, um...
Yes, sir?
I live very simply.
Possessions per se mean very little to me.
Possessions what, sir?
What?
I didn't hear what you said.
Possessions per se, for their own sake.
Ah.
Yes.
Now.
You said, um...
You said the police constable...
Ah, yeah.
You told him that you had some idea who might have committed the crime.
Is that so?
Well, yes.
I think his name is George.
George?
Yes.
George what?
I don't know.
Well, who is this man?
Do you know him?
No.
Can you describe him?
No, I've never seen him.
But you know his name?
Well, yes.
Somebody told me.
Told you what, sir?
That this man, George, might be a burglar.
Who told you?
Well, um...
A young man came to the door.
He was selling something, brushes or something.
Uh, he told me to be careful because, um...
He'd heard somebody talking about a burglary.
They were planning a burglary, you see.
He overheard them.
He heard this man, George, making some sort of a plan to burgle your house?
Not my house specifically, no.
A house in my neighborhood, or so I gather.
That's what I was told.
This young man, the brush salesman, he said he knew the person who was talking, George.
He recognized him, do you see?
And, um, well, that's all, really.
Where did this conversation take place?
What conversation?
The conversation the young man overheard.
In a pub.
In a pub?
I think so, yes.
I'm puzzled, Mr. Turing.
How did the subject come up?
I mean, how did this brush salesman decide to tell you about a conversation he'd overheard in a pub?
Well, I suppose, to warn me, I suppose.
It's very curious, don't you think?
It's not a thing to have happened.
Is it?
I'd have thought so.
Why didn't you inform the police at the time?
Well, it never occurred to me to do so.
I mean, it was only a casual remark.
He just said, be careful, keep your eyes open.
I didn't pay much attention, really.
Hmm.
When did he come to your house?
Three or four weeks ago.
Who did he work for?
Do you remember?
What sort of brushes was he selling?
I've no idea.
It may not have been brushes.
I forget.
It'd be useful if you could remember.
Yes.
I'll try.
Please do.
Excuse me, sir.
Hello, Ross?
Yeah?
When?
Right.
Sorry, sir.
Bit of a problem.
We'll be in touch, OK?
One of the lads will show you out.
We should never have lied.
That was the real mistake, Turing.
I have some very definite ideas of right and wrong, and it's always wrong to lie.
Perhaps he was afraid.
Of course he was afraid.
He cheated during the Latin exam, and he knew he'd be found out.
He knew he'd be punished, but lying made everything a hundred times worse.
Alan!
Alan!
Oh, Lord.
That's my mother.
Give me your coat.
Oh, here you are.
Oh, do forgive me.
I thought I heard the doorbell, but I wasn't quite sure.
I was out in the garden, you see.
Do forgive me.
Alan, dear, won't you introduce your friend?
Oh, sorry.
This is Christopher Morkham.
How do you do, Christopher?
How do you do, Mrs. Turing?
I'm delighted to meet you at long last.
Alan has talked so much about you, and I kept saying to him, do invite Christopher down
for a weekend, never expecting for a moment that he would.
No matter what we say, he always endeavours to keep his school friends to himself.
I think perhaps he's ashamed of us.
Did you have a comfortable journey?
Yes, thank you.
Got the 1.45, first stop, Guildford.
Oh, good.
Do sit down, won't you?
Sit over here by me.
Thank you.
Alan tells me that your family is a flat in town.
Well, it's only very small.
Near Victoria Station, actually.
My mother uses it as a studio.
A studio?
For her sculpture.
She makes sculptures and so on.
How exciting.
Well, not really.
Isn't it?
I would have thought it would be rather exciting to have a mother who's an artist.
It's only a hobby, really.
She spends most of her time looking after the goats.
What goats?
We have a goat farm at home.
Near Victoria Station?
No, no.
In the country.
Our real home is in Worcestershire.
Oh, I love Worcestershire.
The Garden of England.
That's Kent, Mother.
I often wish we'd been able to spend more time in England, but of course that wasn't possible.
Has Alan told you about our travels?
No.
Ah, well, my husband was in the Indian Civil Service.
He's retired now.
Ill health.
But for years we've roamed around India.
So, Baswada, Madras, Kernool, Chattrapur.
Alan was very nearly born in Chattrapur.
How can you be nearly born somewhere?
It doesn't make sense.
Oh, Alan, please.
Well, look at it logically.
I do wish you wouldn't say things like that.
Like what?
You know how it annoys me.
Alan has such an unruly streak in his nature.
I'm sure you're much more level-headed.
Well, I...
Anyway, I'm glad that you've become such firm friends.
Without a steadying influence, it's all too easy for a clever boy to grow into a...
a mere intellectual crime.
Thank you, Mother.
I don't mean that unkindly.
It's a very real danger.
How long have you been at Sherbourne?
A year longer than Turing.
Alan.
And are you enjoying it?
Very much.
Alan's brother went to Malboro.
Did quite well there.
But I was afraid it might be a little rigid for someone like Alan.
Choosing the right school is so tremendously important, don't you think?
And I'm very impressed with Sherbourne.
It's not that wonderful.
Of course it is.
What's wrong with it?
Well, for one thing, they don't treat mathematics as a serious subject.
I can't believe that.
It's true.
Do you know what our form master said the other day?
This room stinks of mathematics, he said, looking straight at me.
Go out and get some disinfectant spray.
He was joking.
He hates anything to do with mathematics or science.
He once said, and he meant it,
he said the Germans lost the Great War because they thought science was far more important than religion.
The teaching of mathematics is not the only way to judge the quality of a school.
It is, as far as I'm concerned.
Oh, Alan.
I gather you share this enthusiasm for sums and science.
Oh, yes, very much so.
And it's wonderful having someone like Alan to work with.
Has he told you about our experiments?
A little.
Wasn't there something to do with iodine?
I have dates, Mother.
We were trying to examine the time delay in the recombination of ions.
Oh, yes.
It was all far beyond my grasp, I'm afraid.
Fascinating, but beyond my grasp.
It was the same with that theory you were telling me about.
What was it?
You know, the man with the Jewish name.
Einstein?
Einstein, yes.
I didn't understand a word of it.
Not one word.
I only wish I did.
Does your family understand these things?
Well, yes.
Up to a point.
Morecambe's brother is a scientist.
They've got their own laboratory at home.
Really?
And he's got his own telescope.
Really?
How splendid.
It's tremendous, Mrs. Turing.
Absolutely terrific.
The other night...
Did I tell you, Turing?
The other night I actually saw one of Jupiter's satellites coming out from Eclipse.
It was amazing.
It was a wonderfully clear night.
Absolutely cloudless.
I felt I was wandering through the universe.
Jupiter, Sirius, Betelgeuse, the Andromeda Nebula.
It was quite overwhelming.
Gosh, how terrific.
The hugeness of creation.
Yes, it all sounds very thrilling, I must say.
But I do hope you don't frighten your family the way Alan does.
Frighten them how?
He got up at three o'clock in the morning last Thursday.
I can't imagine why.
I woke up and heard footsteps on the stairs.
I was convinced that we had burglars in the house.
And my husband was on the point of telephoning to the police when we realized it was only Alan.
I was mapping the constellation of fixed stars.
I sometimes wish he was interested in stamp collecting or model trains like other boys.
Let's have some tea, shall we?
Do wash your hands, Alan.
They're covered in ink.
Did Alan tell you about my grandfather's cousin?
He was a scientist.
He invented the electron.
He didn't invent it, Mother.
Electrons exist.
You can't invent them.
Well, he found them or discovered them or something like that.
He was a fellow of the Royal Society.
Very distinguished.
Do wash your hands.
Sorry, Morecambe.
One can't choose one's own mother.
She's all right.
Do you know what I wish?
What?
I wish this was my house, my own house.
And then we could live here, you and I.
We'd have our own rooms, our own laboratories.
We'd share everything.
We'd work together.
What a wonderful life that would be.
Yes.
Yes, it would.
Come on, Christopher.
I'd better go.
Chris.
Thank you for coming to see me.
Don't forget to wash your hands.
Anyone sitting here?
No.
Quiet tonight?
Yes.
Very.
All the pubs are the same.
I've just been down in the King's Head.
Same as this place.
Nobody around.
Perhaps it's the weather.
Yeah.
Bloody cold.
Real Christmas weather.
Bloody Christmas.
Christmas in Manchester.
The bleeding, bitter end.
I saw you in here last week.
I saw you in here last week.
Yeah.
Could be.
Yeah, I come in here.
Often.
God knows why.
Quiet as a bloody grave.
Should have stayed at the King's Head.
They've got a jukebox down there.
That livens it up a bit.
All the latest hits.
Johnny Ray, Guy Mitchell, Frankie Lane.
Perry Como.
Rosemary Clooney.
Nat King Cole.
Still.
It's handy in here.
Handy for work?
No, no.
You know, just handy.
Where do you work?
I don't.
Not at the moment.
I had a job.
Making spectacle frames.
And the bloody government starts making cuts.
No more free teeth and glasses on the National Health.
Bang goes a job.
Bye-bye, they said.
Piss off.
That's bad luck.
You're telling me.
So I'm stuck at home.
Not much fun in that.
What about you?
I've got my own place.
I meant your job.
I'm at the university.
Bit old for that, aren't you?
I'm on the staff.
A teacher?
Not exactly.
I, um...
Well, I do research.
What sort?
Scientific.
Uh, mathematics.
How's your drink?
Fine.
Actually, we're trying to build a special sort of machine.
What people call the electronic brain.
Bloody hell.
That sounds a bit...
A bit what?
It sounds like that film.
What film?
Michael Rennie.
I saw it when I was down in London.
Uh, Michael Rennie and some sort of robot.
The Day the Earth Stood Still.
Did you see it?
No.
Bloody good.
So, uh, what's it do, this thing you're making?
Well, you give it problems, mathematical problems, and it solves them very quickly.
How quickly?
Very, very quickly.
Far more quickly than a man could.
Like an adding machine?
No, it's more than that.
We're trying to make a machine that can learn things and eventually think for itself.
Think for itself?
Why not?
Bloody hell.
It's not a robot, and it's not really a brain.
Not like a human brain.
Anyhow, it's what we call a digital computer.
You, you thought this up, did you?
Sort of.
Oh.
Must be interesting.
Job like that.
We do.
Yeah, must be.
Good money, too, I bet.
Well, not bad.
I once fancied being a chemist.
Must have been about 14.
Don't know why.
Just fancied the idea of it somehow.
Did you do anything about it?
Yeah, I bought myself a chemistry set.
Blew the bloody windows out.
That was the end of that.
Look, um, would you like something to eat?
There's a cafe at the end of the road, and...
I can't, really.
Not now.
Right.
Right.
Some other time, maybe.
Yes, all right.
When?
Don't mind.
This weekend?
If you like.
What about Friday evening?
Okay.
Come to my house.
Okay.
This is the address.
Come to my house.
Do you know where it is?
I can find it.
Come about seven.
I'll cook you a meal.
Good cook, are you?
Not bad.
What's your name?
Ron.
Alan.
Okay, Alan.
I'll see you Friday.
About seven.
About seven.
Don't change your mind.
I'll be there.
We're having a bit of a problem with regard to this brush salesman you were telling us about.
Oh?
We spoke to some of your neighbours.
No one seems to have seen him but you.
I don't understand it.
Perhaps they were out when he called.
All of them?
It's possible.
And we checked with the local domestic appliance firms.
None of them have had a salesman working in your area.
Well, as I said, I might have been mistaken.
What about?
What he was doing.
What he was selling.
I can't believe you'd make a mistake like that, sir.
You must have been talking to him for several minutes at least.
Weren't you?
As I recall, I was rather preoccupied.
I was working, you see.
And, um...
Well, to be honest, I don't remember much about him.
What did he look like?
You must remember what he looked like.
Not really.
Uh, youngish.
Ordinary.
I didn't take much notice of him.
You didn't, did you, sir?
Oh, no.
Why not?
He was only a travelling salesman, after all.
Even so.
All that talk about burglars and suspicious characters?
I'd have made sure I knew what he looked like.
Well, perhaps that's because you're a policeman.
Could be.
Anyway, why is he so important?
Surely it's the burglar you should be looking for.
Supposing he wasn't a brush salesman.
Supposing he was somehow involved in the burglary.
What makes you think that?
Might even be the burglar.
It's an old trick.
He knocks on the door.
No one answers.
In he goes.
Brush salesman's story is just camouflage.
But that doesn't make sense.
Why not?
Well, if he was involved in the burglary, why should he pretend to warn me?
People do funny things.
Oh, look.
Uh, this is ridiculous.
I feel I'm making a fuss about nothing.
I didn't lose very much.
Well, hardly anything.
And I can't think why I bothered to report it.
I'm glad you did, sir.
All crimes should be reported.
Big and small.
But it all seems so trivial.
Trivial?
Well, don't you think?
Well, that's our problem now.
So don't you worry about it.
Okay?
If you say so.
Good.
If you remember anything, no matter how trivial it might seem, I'd be grateful if you'd let me know.
All right.
You won't be leaving Manchester, will you, sir?
How do you mean?
Just in case I need to talk to you.
Um, no.
No, no.
Um, well, I'll be in London next week.
Just for a couple of days.
When?
Tuesday and Wednesday.
I'm doing a broadcast.
Oh, really?
Uh, yes.
A talk, you know.
A discussion.
What about?
Um, machines.
Can machines think?
Is it possible to build a machine that thinks for itself?
That sounds interesting.
When's it on?
Tuesday evening, third program, eight o'clock.
Well, I'll listen.
Make a point of it.
Thanks very much, Mr. Turing.
I'll give you a ring if anything comes up.
Thank you.
What do you think, Detective Sergeant?
Bit of a joke, him doing a broadcast with a stammer like that.
About the burglary.
I'm not sure, Mr. Smith, sir.
It doesn't add up somehow.
He's not telling us everything.
Do you think he's lying?
I think he might be.
Let me know what happens.
Your superintendent knows where to find me.
Yes, sir.
And handle it carefully, Ross.
Carefully and discreetly.
Yes, sir.
There are certain anxieties.
The Foreign Office wants to avoid any possible embarrassment.
I didn't know he was mixed up with the Foreign Office.
Yeah, he got to be their chap during the war.
Quite a big fish, our Mr. Turing.
Winston?
Winston thought the world of him.
So, you found us all right?
Yes.
Thank you, Mr. Knox.
No problems.
Oh, silly question, really.
I mean, here you are.
Of course you found us.
Punctual to the minute.
Bravo.
That's quite an achievement these days.
If only Churchill could take a leaf out of Mussolini's book and make the trains run on time.
Which one did you catch?
I got here this morning, actually.
This morning?
I didn't want to be late.
You've been here all day?
Yes.
Oh, dear.
Poor you.
Oh, dear.
Bletchley doesn't have much to offer, as you must have discovered.
I went to the cinema.
Well, exactly.
Nothing else to do here.
What did you see?
A cartoon film?
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
I think I saw it.
I took one of my nieces.
I invariably fall asleep at the cinema.
Isn't there a wicked witch?
Yes.
She gives Snow White a poisoned apple.
Oh, don't tell me it's got a sad ending.
No.
She wakes up in the arms of a handsome prince.
It's quite touching, really, in a sentimental sort of way.
Well, obviously, I wasn't paying enough attention.
I must make a point of seeing it again sometime.
Do sit down.
You must be wondering what this is all about.
Well, I know your reputation as a codebreaker, Mr. Knox.
I assumed it was something to do with the deciphering work that you're doing here.
Ah, you've heard about that.
Nothing much.
Just talk.
What sort of talk?
Amongst my colleagues at Cambridge.
It's supposed to be tremendously secret, this place.
I mean, quite tremendously secret.
Hence all the barbed wire and soldiers and passwords and so on.
Yes, I realize that.
How'd you get in, by the way?
Did they tell you the password?
I showed them your letter.
Oh, good.
Well done.
I always make such a frightful balls of her, this password nonsense.
It must be something to do with my age.
In what respect?
Failing memory.
We all live far too long.
That's the trouble.
Faculties fade.
The body disintegrates.
The mind crumbles.
My solicitor says that dentists are to blame.
He opines that nature intended us to die as soon as our teeth drop out.
But thanks to the advances in dentistry, we struggle on into an infirm and wretched old age.
Yes?
I didn't speak.
What was I saying?
Passwords.
Ah, yes, yes, yes.
We're supposed to call this place Station X, but of course everybody knows it's the Government Code and Cipher School, the GCCS.
It's waggishly referred to as the Golf Club and Chess Society.
You'll have to bear with me, Turing.
I'm not an administrator, neither am I a mathematician.
But since it seems highly likely that we shall be working together,
the powers that be think we should have some sort of exploratory conversation.
Is, um, is that all right with you?
Of course.
Good.
Ah, this is your file.
I shall consult it from time to time.
There's no need to be alarmed.
I'm not.
Good.
So, you went to Sherbrooke.
Ha-ha!
And then King's College.
Good.
And then America.
1936 to 1938.
Two years in America.
How was that?
Did you enjoy Princeton?
Well, yes.
It was, uh, yes.
Enjoy is scarcely the right word, perhaps.
No, as a matter of fact, it was, it was very enjoyable, very stimulating.
What exactly did you do there?
Um, well, I'd, uh, just published a paper on computable numbers,
and I was able to develop some of those ideas and, um, various other things,
various other research projects.
All concerned with mathematics and logic?
Yes.
Yes.
And your interest in codes and ciphers, how did that begin?
Well, I've always been interested, I think ever since I was a boy,
I got a prize at school, a book called Mathematical Recreations and Essays.
There was a chapter on cryptography.
I found it fascinating, and I suppose it awakened my interest.
It focused my interest in ciphers.
And then, um, much more recently, when I came back from America,
I realized that my ideas in mathematics and logic might be applied to ciphers.
And, uh, that, of course, created something of a dilemma.
Why?
I knew that such knowledge would acquire military value if war were declared.
I was concerned about the moral implications of putting my, um, intellectual armory
at the, uh, disposal of a government at war.
Have you managed to resolve this dilemma?
Well, I'm here.
Doesn't that answer your question?
Not necessarily.
I gather you're a supporter of the anti-war movement at Cambridge.
In 1933, yes.
Would you describe yourself as a pacifist?
No, I wouldn't.
Well, you've changed your mind?
No, I've always felt that some wars could be justified.
Justified how?
As a lesser evil in the last resort.
Hitler has brought us to that last resort.
So you would regard this war as a necessary evil?
Well, first and foremost, I regard this war as a most unfortunate interruption to my work,
but, um, yes, also, you're right, I do think of it as a necessary evil.
And what about loyalty to your country, a sense of duty?
Do these considerations carry any weight with you?
As it happens, I, I have a deep and passionate love of my country,
but whenever I hear people appealing to my loyalty or duty,
I feel that I'm being made to do something that I don't want to do.
I've come here because I have decided for myself what I should do in the, uh,
the current circumstances.
I think I'd be more useful here than on a, b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-battlefield.
A word of warning.
Do not imagine that the nature of the work we do will protect you
from the moral responsibility for killing and destruction.
Sometimes very hard decisions have to be made.
How do you feel about that?
I have always been willing, eager, in fact,
to accept the moral responsibility for what I do.
Good. Good.
I've been furnished with some details of your work, Mr. Turing,
most of which I have to tell you I find almost totally incomprehensible.
Well, that's hardly surprising.
Well, I knew quite a bit about mathematics when I was young,
but this is, well, baffling.
And, for example, this thing here,
on computable numbers with an application to the Entscheidungsproblem.
Oh, perhaps you could tell me about it?
Tell you what?
Well, anything.
A few words of explanation in general terms.
A few words of explanation?
Yes.
In general terms?
If possible.
Well, it's about right and wrong in general terms.
It's a technical paper in mathematical logic,
but it's also about the difficulty of telling right from wrong.
Oh.
People think, most people think,
that in mathematics we always know what is right and what is wrong.
Not so.
Not anymore.
It's a problem that's occupied mathematicians for 40 or 50 years.
How can you tell right from wrong?
Well, David Hilbert.
I don't suppose his name means much to you.
There we are.
That's the way of the world.
People never seem to hear of the really great mathematicians.
Hilbert said,
if we're going to have any fundamental system for mathematics,
it must satisfy three basic requirements.
Consistency, completeness, and decidability.
He thought that this was a very reasonable set of requirements to impose,
but within a few years,
Kurt Gödel showed that no system for mathematics
could be both consistent and complete.
Mathematics is either inconsistent or it's incomplete.
But the question of decidability was still unresolved.
Hilbert thought that there should be a single clearly defined method
for deciding whether or not mathematical assertions were provable.
The decision problem.
He called it the entscheidungsproblem.
In my paper on computable numbers,
I wanted to show that there can be no one method that will work for all questions.
Solving mathematical problems requires an infinite supply
of new ideas.
It was, of course, a monumental task to prove such a thing.
One had to examine the provability of all mathematical assertions,
past, present, and future.
How on earth could this be done?
And one word gave me the clue.
People had been talking about the possibility of a mechanical method,
a method that could be applied mechanically to solving mathematical problems
without requiring any human intervention or ingenuity.
Machine.
That was the crucial word.
I conceived the idea of a machine,
a Turing machine,
that would be able to scan mathematical symbols to read them,
if you like,
to read mathematical assertions,
and arrive at a verdict as to whether or not that assertion is provable.
And with this concept,
I was able to prove that Hilbert was wrong.
My idea worked.
You actually built this machine?
No, of course not.
It was a machine of the imagination.
Building it wasn't important.
It's a perfectly clear idea, after all.
Yes, I see.
Well, I don't,
but I see something, I think.
Now, forgive me for asking a crass and naive question,
but what is the point of devising a machine that cannot be built
in order to prove that there are certain mathematical statements
that cannot be proved?
Is there any practical value in all this?
The possibilities are boundless.
This is only the beginning.
In my paper, I explain how a special kind of Turing machine,
I call it a universal machine,
could carry out any mental process whatsoever.
The originality of your thinking is clearly remarkable,
and I'm sure that you'll prove to be an invaluable member of our team,
a group, call it what you will.
We'd like you to start work immediately.
Is that all right?
Of course.
Are there any questions that you want to ask me?
Not really.
My only anxiety is about fitting in to a place like this.
I've never been very good at organising things,
least of all myself,
and I'm not sure how well I'll function in a government department.
Oh, you mustn't worry about that.
There's a healthy disregard of organisational formality at GCCS.
If there weren't, I wouldn't be here.
As far as I'm concerned, rules are only important in cricket, poetry,
and the scholarly editing of ancient texts.
I'm going to ask Miss Green to join us.
Will you ask Pat to come in, please?
Patricia Green is one of our most able cryptoanalysts,
quite as good as any chap.
What sort of work shall I be doing?
Well, you'll be concentrating on something called the Enigma Code.
It's been devised and developed by the Germans,
and it's an absolute pig.
Mr. Knox?
Ah, Pat, come in.
Come in to meet Alan Turing.
How do you do?
How do you do?
You'll be working with Pat and Gordon Welshman.
Have you found him somewhere to live?
The Crown Inn at Shenley Brook End.
Oh, good, good.
That's only about three miles away.
Turing, have you got a bicycle?
You'll need a bicycle.
Pat, I shall rely on you to tell Mr. Turing about the Enigma.
Yes, of course.
The point is, Turing, this damn code is a vital part of the Nazi war effort.
Vital.
The army uses it, so does the Luftwaffe,
and most importantly, so do the U-boats.
And if the U-boats get control of the North Atlantic,
our merchant ships won't stand a chance.
They'll starve us out.
So, the Enigma's got to be broken.
What type of code is it?
Mechanical.
Which puts the ball firmly in your court.
They have a machine which substitutes one letter for another.
But there are thousands of millions of ways the substitutions can be made,
depending on how it's set up each day.
Basically, our problem is one of solving equations with permutation groups.
Do you know what the permutations are?
First things first, go back to Cambridge and pack your bags.
Now, Pat will give you a guided tour on Monday morning.
Bledsley was chosen by the GCCS because it's equidistant from Oxford and Cambridge.
I should warn you that the unexpected influx of academics and intellectuals
has put a severe strain on local resources.
You'll find it very difficult to get pipe tobacco or copies of the Times.
Actually, we've met before.
Have we?
When?
You read a paper to the Moral Science Club at Cambridge.
We met briefly afterwards.
That must have been, uh, when?
December 1933.
I remember it very clearly.
I remember you saying that mathematical propositions had not just one,
but a variety of interpretations.
You opened up all sorts of possibilities I'd never thought of before.
that was most exciting.
Thank you.
Well, I'll see you on Monday.
Yes.
Fine, I'll look forward to it.
What's the time?
Nine o'clock.
Bit of a bloody mess.
What is?
This house.
What's all that stuff in the bathroom?
Doesn't that stink?
Well, I'm trying to make some weed killer.
What for?
To kill weeds.
Well, why don't you buy some?
You can afford it.
Well, I like making things.
It's fun.
Did you sleep all right?
Not bad.
Do you do this often?
Do what?
Have blokes back here?
Not often.
Have you always been queer?
Yes.
Never fancied girls?
No.
I like a bit of both myself.
I'd rather have a girl, but give them the chance, but they're not so easy to get.
Not when you're broke.
Some real old queen picked me up when I was in London.
Silk seats, mirror over the bed.
Bit different to this place.
You were talking in your sleep.
Was that what they say?
I couldn't make it out.
You seemed frightened or something.
I was having a dream.
It's funny.
I've had the same dream over and over again ever since I was a kid.
What is it?
Well, it's really more of a nightmare, really.
It's as if I'm in some huge empty space.
It's sort of floating there, you know, just floating in midair in this great, dark, empty space.
And suddenly, ever so quiet at first, a strange noise begins.
I can't describe it.
It's a sort of noise you can feel all through your body.
And I start trembling.
And I can feel myself trembling with the noise.
And as the noise gets louder, I tremble more and more.
And I start to shake.
And it gets louder and louder.
And there's nothing I can do to stop it.
Nothing.
What happens then?
That's it.
That's all.
Then I wake up.
It's pretty spooky, eh?
You don't have snow.
Sorry.
Just like my dad.
You can hear him snoring all over the bloody house.
What were you doing in London?
How do you mean?
Were you working?
Having a holiday or what?
Sort of holiday, I suppose.
I hitched a lift down to see the Festival of Britain.
Bloody good.
Did you go?
Yes.
Like it?
It was all right.
Bloody good, I thought.
Anyway, tried to get a job down there, but nothing worked out.
I got Nick pinching food from Sainsbury's.
They sent me back here on probation.
What's that place down the road?
What place?
That big shed.
You can see it from the bedroom window.
It's an old RAF hangar.
I didn't know the RAF was up here.
They were during the war.
Were you there then?
Where were you?
Around and about.
Doing what?
Working for the government.
Doing what?
I was, um, I was a codebreaker.
A what?
A codebreaker.
I deciphered all the German codes and won the war single-handedly.
That's top secret.
Of course, nobody knows.
Just me.
You and Mr. Churchill.
I'll tell you something else.
What's that?
That, um, that hangar down the road.
It grows bigger at night.
You're balmy.
It does.
You look.
You're balmy.
It seems to, anyway.
In the daytime, it's just an ordinary large shed.
But when the sun goes down, it seems to get bigger and bigger.
I'm thinking of writing a story about it.
Good idea.
Do you think so?
Why not?
It's rather like that film you enjoyed so much.
The one about the robot?
Yes.
It's quite creepy, quite spooky.
I imagine that I go inside the hangar.
It's deserted.
Derelict.
Very dark.
You can't see a thing.
And as I go in, the door bangs shut behind me.
No way out.
No way out.
And then, and then I realize that it's not a hangar at all.
I'm trapped inside an enormous mechanical brain.
And this brain, the hangar, starts to play chess with me.
And I've got to win, otherwise I'll never get out.
All day and all night we play.
All the next day and all the next night.
But the brain's too clever for me.
I can't keep up with the moves.
And I'm terrified I'll be trapped there for the rest of my life.
Trouble is, I can't think of a good ending.
Fast Gordon comes in and rescues you.
I thought perhaps I could find a piece of chalk and write a few sums on the wall.
Very easy sums.
Simple arithmetic, that sort of thing.
And I'd do them deliberately badly, make silly mistakes.
I'd do them so slowly and so badly that the brain would get more and more despairing.
And then, finally...
What?
The brain commits suicide.
What do you think of that?
Flash Gordon's better.
Ah.
Yes.
Maybe.
You got any tea?
In the kitchen.
Right.
There's no milk.
Oh, sorry.
No tea either.
Just coffee.
We'll have some breakfast later.
I'm starving.
I haven't any shops around here.
Ah.
There's a place at the end of the road.
I'll loop down, shall I?
Got any money?
Uh.
Go and put your shoes on.
I'll find some.
Right.
I think a pound.
Should cover it.
Oh.
Oh.
I'll get some tea and milk.
How about some bacon?
Have you been taking money from my wallet?
What?
You heard.
I haven't touched your bloody wallet.
I had 15 pounds yesterday.
There's only seven left.
It's nothing to do with me.
Well, is it gone then?
How should I know?
Give it back.
I haven't got it.
I don't believe you.
All right.
Search me.
Oh, don't be ridiculous.
Come on.
Search me.
Well, you've hidden it somewhere.
What the fuck are you talking about?
Look, why should I take money from you?
You said you were hard up.
I didn't.
You said you were out of work.
So what?
Please, Ron, give it back.
Chris off.
Give it back, and we'll say no more about it.
I'm not a bloody thief.
You just said you were.
You said you were on probation.
If you think I nicked that money, call the police.
Come on.
There's the phone.
What are you waiting for?
Come on.
Put it down.
Right.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I lost my temper.
I'm sorry.
Perhaps I made a mistake.
Fucking nerve.
I'm sorry.
Where are you going?
I'm not bloody staying here.
Please don't go.
Please don't go.
I must have been mistaken.
I'm sorry.
I thought I had 15 pounds.
Maybe I didn't.
Let's forget it, shall we?
Go and get us some breakfast.
Get it yourself.
I said I'm sorry.
So what?
Let's be friends.
Do you want some money?
Do you?
What?
How much do you need?
I'm not a bloody rent boy.
I know.
If you're hard up, if you want some money, all you've got to do is ask.
Call it a loan, then.
How much?
Three pounds.
Shall I see you again?
Maybe.
Yeah, maybe.
Perhaps I'll see you in the pub.
Yeah.
I'd better go.
Have some breakfast first.
Tea and bacon.
Look, here's the money.
Have some breakfast, then go.
I'll cook you bacon and eggs.
I can't stay long.
I know.
Okay.
Where's this shop?
Down the road?
Down the road.
Turn left.
There are no oranges and no lemons.
So we've made a fruit cocktail out of apples and bears.
It tastes very nice.
It's a depressing colour.
Don't start finding fault.
Things are difficult enough these days.
Pat's coming to church with me.
Oh, good.
There you are.
Do come, Alan, dear.
Hmm.
Not today.
Oh.
What's the matter?
Oh, it's terribly sour.
Is it?
Try some.
I already have.
What's that drink made from pears?
Is it called peri?
Yes, I think so.
Well, this is a combination of cider and peri.
Cideri.
Peri, dear.
I'm so glad you were able to come down today.
I was afraid there might have been a last-minute change of plans.
I've been looking forward to it.
Have you, dear?
So have I.
It's so seldom that Alan invites his friends to see us.
Hardly ever, in fact.
Of course, it was different when he was at school.
His friend Chris used to come most holidays.
Such a charming boy and a very nice family.
I don't think Pat wants to hear about my boyhood relationships.
Why not?
It's always interesting to learn something about people you're fond of.
I do envy your having gone to Cambridge, Pat.
When I was young, it was considered a waste of time to give a girl a good education.
And if you did show any sign of intellectual ability, you were always afraid of being called a blue-stocking.
It was really most unfair.
Would you like some more?
Please.
Do come to church, Alan.
It would be so nice if we all went together.
What's the point?
Does there have to be a point?
It seems idiotic for a non-believer to spend his Sunday evening in church.
You're not a non-believer.
I am.
You used not to be.
He was once extremely devout.
You never understood what I thought.
Maybe not.
Pat, is your father Church of England?
Yes.
His parish is in Wiltshire.
It's always been a daydream of mine to live in an ivy-covered vicarage, deep in the country, with oaks and elms and a distant view of a lovely Norman church.
Is that some sugar?
Do you have any sugar?
We only get eight ounces a week.
Well, doesn't rationing apply to people like you?
People like me?
One's always hearing about people in hush-hush jobs living off the fat of the land.
Would you say we lived off the fat of the land?
Hardly.
Absolutely not.
And stop fishing.
Fishing?
All these hints about hush-hush jobs you know perfectly well.
We can't tell you what we do.
All right.
Don't be cross.
I'll go and see if we've got any sugar.
She's quite right, you know.
What about?
I do like hearing about your family and friends.
I wish you talked about them.
I do sometimes.
Apart from anything else, it's embarrassing.
I had no idea your father was ill until your mother mentioned it.
He's not ill.
He's in poor health.
He had a prostate operation some years ago, and he's been vaguely off color ever since.
And my brother's in the army, by the way, just to complete the picture.
He's in the army in Egypt.
Yes, I know.
Oh, I suppose my mother told you.
Yes.
Well, since she tells you everything, there's no need for me to duplicate the information.
Well, is there?
Who's Chris?
He's a friend of mine at Sherbourne.
Your mother obviously liked him.
Yes.
Yes, he was a remarkable boy.
Very clever.
Very perceptive.
Very mature for his age.
He made everyone else seem so ordinary.
It was one of those intense friendships that only happen when you're young.
I worship the ground he walked on.
Have you kept in touch?
He died.
He had TB when he was a small boy.
I didn't know that.
He never told me.
He hadn't really recovered.
He was taken ill at school.
We were all asleep.
The next morning, I heard he'd been rushed to hospital.
He died six days later.
Thursday, February the 13th, 1930.
I was devastated.
Poor Alan.
I felt, I felt as if I should have died and not him.
And that the only possible excuse for living was that I should achieve something Chris could no longer do.
I used to think after he died, I almost believed that he was still with me in spirit and could help me.
It was that, I think, that gave my mother the impression that I was devoutly religious.
It wasn't that at all.
I was obsessed with the idea, with the question, whether or not Christopher's mind could exist without his body.
It was an obsession that stayed with me for many years.
What are mental processes?
Can they take place in something other than a living brain?
In a way, in a very real way, many of the problems I've tried to solve in my work lead directly back to Chris.
Wouldn't he be amused?
I think he'd be pleased.
I hope so.
Why don't you come to church?
It'd give your mother so much pleasure.
It would be a lie.
Like pretending this ghastly drink isn't ghastly.
It's a pretty harmless pretense.
Most pretense is self-deluding, and that's far from harmless.
Just look at all our confreres at Bletchley.
Everyone pretending to be so radiantly optimistic.
Why do it? Why? What's the point?
It's better than being gloomy all the time.
I worked out the chances of our being able to crack the U-boat Enigma.
Guess what they are.
Well, I suppose it must be something like...
Fifty thousand to one against.
We might be lucky.
Pigs might fly.
And I've been wondering what would happen if we lost the war, how we'd survive.
Don't think about such things.
Well, you've got to, otherwise you're just burying your head in the sand.
All we can do is live from day to day.
Everything changes, you know that.
We ought to make plans.
Like what?
Well, I thought of buying some razor blades.
They'll be in very short supply if we lost the war, so at least we'd have something to sell.
Razor blades.
How many razor blades?
Enough to fill a large suitcase.
Prof, you're not serious.
I certainly am.
You can't just walk into a chemist's shop and buy hundreds, thousands of razor blades.
Well, can you?
I don't know.
Possibly.
Well, you can't.
I could buy some silver.
Silver what?
Lumps of it.
Ingots.
Or whatever they're called.
If I took some money out of the bank and bought a couple of silver ingots,
I could bury them and dig them up when the war is over.
Bury them where?
Anywhere, somewhere at Bletchley.
Oh, Alan.
Why not?
Oh, Alan.
I'm serious.
I mean it.
I've already made some inquiries about buying the silver.
Oh, Alan.
Look at this.
It's a fur comb.
I can see it's a fur comb.
Take it.
Look at it.
I tell you something extraordinary about it.
It looks ordinary enough to me.
Define what is meant by a Fibonacci sequence.
Oh.
A Fibonacci sequence is a sequence of numbers where each is the sum of the previous two.
One, then one.
Then one and one, two.
One and two, three.
Then two and three, five.
Then three and five, eight.
Five and eight, 13.
Well done.
Full marks.
Now, look at that fur cone.
Look at the pattern of the bracts, the leaves.
Follow them, spiraling round the cone.
Eight lines, twisting to the left.
Thirteen, twisting to the right.
The numbers always come from the Fibonacci sequence.
Always?
Always.
And not just fur cones.
The petals of most flowers grow in the same way.
Isn't that amazing?
Yes, it is.
And it prompts the age-old question.
Is good God a mathematician?
I love you, Prof.
I love you.
You know that?
Yes.
You're supposed to say, I love you too.
I know.
Please say something.
I don't think of myself as a very lovable person.
Well, you are.
There are lots of men at Bletchley who are much more lovable than me.
That's the way you're wrong.
Oh, don't be silly.
Of course there are.
I've seen them every lunchtime rushing around the lawn playing cricket.
Laughing, looking all fit and healthy and manly.
I can't imagine why you haven't fallen in love with one of them.
Because they're dull.
That's why.
And so am I.
That's where you're wrong.
You're untidy.
And messy.
And lacking almost all the social graces.
Your clothes are stained and you bite your nails.
You tell the truth when it would be kinder to tell a lie.
And you've got no patience with people who bore you.
But you are not dull.
And I love you.
As a matter of fact, I do love you.
As a friend.
As a friend.
That might change.
Perhaps that might change.
I'm a homosexual.
I know.
It doesn't stop me loving you.
It needn't stop you loving me.
It would stop me making love to you.
I don't want that sort of life and neither do you, I'm sure.
Pardon?
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to interrupt.
Don't bother with the sugar.
That drink is undrinkable.
Well, I'll make some tea, shall I?
Would you like some tea?
Give me the sugar bowl.
Tea or sherry?
Which would you prefer?
I don't mind.
If you're going to church, it had better be tea.
You don't want to breathe alcoholic fumes all over the vicar.
What's the matter?
Nothing.
Has Alan said something to upset you?
No, of course not.
I'm sorry.
It's none of my business.
I'm sorry.
Nothing's wrong.
I'm perfectly all right.
He's always been his own worst enemy.
Always.
Even when he was young.
Even at school.
His headmaster at Sherbourne called him antisocial, I remember.
We were terribly upset.
I'd better get ready for church.
Don't come if you don't want to.
No, I'd like to, really.
I'll take the tray, shall I?
Thank you.
Come in.
Sergeant Ross.
Sorry to bother you at home, sir.
Oh, it's no bother.
Please, come in.
Thank you, sir.
I've just been...
I do a bit of running.
Ah.
I can't do as much as I used to, alas.
Middle age.
Creeping on.
Where were you?
Long distance, sprinter or what?
Long distance, three miles, marathon as well.
Three miles?
God.
I couldn't run three miles when I was 20, let alone now.
Once for the marathon.
Do you want to ask me some more questions?
Yes, sir, I do.
But first of all, I think we should try to clear up this story of yours.
What story?
The one about a young man coming to your house to sell things, brushes, I think you said?
Yes.
We have good reason to believe that you were lying.
Were you lying?
Yes.
Why?
I'm sorry.
It was foolish of me.
Would you like to tell me what really happened?
There was no brush salesman.
I, um...
A friend told me about the burglar, George.
The friend?
Yes.
How did he know about the burglary?
Well, he didn't know exactly, he guessed.
How did he guess?
He was having a drink with George, you see, in a milk bar.
And, uh, he mentioned me.
My friend mentioned me and told George where I lived.
He'd been to dinner, you see, my friend.
He'd been to dinner just a few days before, and he was telling George all about it.
And then, um, after the burglary, I told my friend what had happened, and he said it might have been George.
He knew that George was a p-p-p-petty thief, or whatever the expression is.
It was just a guess.
Well, your friend was right.
Was he?
CID officers found some fingerprints in your house.
This man, George, has a criminal record.
Oh, I see.
So that proves it?
Yes, I see.
This friend of yours, what's his name?
Ron.
Ron Miller.
A colleague at the university?
Well, no.
A social acquaintance?
Uh, in a way.
Have you known him long?
Not really.
How long?
Three or four weeks.
And in those three or four weeks, how many times have you seen him?
About once a week.
How did you meet?
Uh, just, you know, casually.
Oh, he's just a casual social acquaintance?
Yes.
It's not what you'd call a close friend?
No.
So, why did you lie to conceal his identity?
I, um, well, I didn't want to get him in trouble.
Why not?
Well.
He was, after all, partly responsible for your house being burglar.
No, I wouldn't say that.
Wouldn't you say?
Well, I wouldn't say responsible.
Partly responsible?
No, it's difficult to say.
I mean, it's difficult to say what his role in all this was.
I mean, is.
He told George your address?
Yes.
And presumably he knows that George has got a criminal record.
Well, yes.
So, why go to all these lengths to protect him?
Well, the truth is I'm having an affair with him.
With Ron?
Yes.
What sort of an affair?
Well, the usual sort.
I mean, go, going to bed.
Sex.
You're having a sexual relationship with this man, Ron?
Yes.
What sort of sexual relationship?
How many sorts are there?
You tell me, sir.
What exactly do you want to know?
I need to understand the precise nature of this sexual relationship.
You mean you want to know what we did?
It would help.
Well, since you ask, it wasn't much more than mutual masturbation.
Did penetration occur?
No.
Look, isn't all this rather off the point?
I thought you were trying to establish who had burgled my house.
That's part of it, yes.
Part of it?
Part of what?
You've just told me you've committed a criminal offence.
I can't just ignore that, can I?
What criminal offence?
Gross indecency.
Now, look, I didn't corrupt him.
Ron knew what he was doing.
He came to my house.
My house, don't forget.
He came here perfectly well aware that we'd almost certainly go to bed together.
It didn't come as any great surprise to him.
He's had other homosexual experiences.
I mean, I, I, it's ludicrous to talk about a criminal offence.
And as I say, everything happened here in private, in my own house, in private.
If I hadn't told you, you wouldn't have known anything about it.
But you did tell me.
Can't you forget about it?
Can't you?
How old is this Ron?
Uh, I don't know, 19, 20?
And how old are you, sir?
Um, 39.
Does that matter?
Obviously, I shouldn't have told you.
I'm always saying things I shouldn't.
Um, well, surely there's not any need to make a fuss about this.
I mean, surely you can forget it, can't you?
It's not asking much after all.
Please.
Um, what's the position if I make a statement, shall I?
That's up to you, sir.
Anyway, um, all right.
Uh, yes.
I'll make a statement.
You want me to, uh, go to the police station?
I'd better get dressed.
I'll do it, sir.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you.
Members of the staff, boys, I want you to imagine a bowl of porridge, a bowl of cold porridge.
When I was a boy at Sherbin some 25 years ago, we always had porridge for breakfast, every day, winter and summer, or so it seems.
And for some unaccountable reason, by the time the porridge reached me, it was cold.
My friend Christopher Morecambe was more fortunate.
He enjoyed his porridge and ate it heartily.
But I always sat there at breakfast, staring into a bowl of cold porridge, grey and soft and wrinkled on top.
You must be wondering why I'm telling you all this.
The headmaster asked me to come here and talk about my work with computers, and here I am describing bowls of cold porridge.
Well, there's a good reason for it, and I'll come to that in a moment.
I dare say the word computer is unfamiliar to many of you.
It is to a lot of people.
But if I said electronic brain, oh, that's much more interesting, or if I were to ask, can a machine think, I'm sure you'd be intrigued to know the answer.
But before we can consider that properly, I must explain something about computers and how they work.
First of all, let me compare a computer with the human brain, which brings us back to our bowl of cold porridge, because that's what a human brain looks like.
It's the same colour, the same texture.
The computer is very different.
It's big, the size of several large wardrobes all joined together.
It's hard and metallic on the outside and terribly complicated on the inside with lots of valves and condensers.
This is not a bit like cold porridge, but that doesn't matter.
It's the logical pattern of the brain that counts, not the grey stuff that it's made of.
It's the same with the computer.
What matters is its logic.
And the logic of a computer is really very simple.
All it does is to read a list of instructions.
We call this a program, and then it carries it out methodically.
The only thing you have to do is write down exactly what you want done in the language the computer understands.
Now, I know this sounds like a fanciful theory, but I assure you that it's not.
The computer at Manchester University has been working for over four years, since 1949, and has successfully tackled a wide variety of tasks.
Many of the people think that computers are glorified calculating machines.
It's not so.
It's true that computers calculate very quickly, but computer programs don't have to do anything to do with numbers.
A colleague of mine has got our computer to hum tunes.
It once sang jingle bells.
We even got it to write love letters.
Doing calculations, humming a tune, writing love letters.
These are very different tasks.
But they're all done by one machine, and that's an extremely important fact about computers.
A computer is a universal machine.
And I've proved how it can perform any task that can be described in symbols.
I would go further.
It is my view that a computer can perform any task that the human brain can carry out.
Any task.
Now, you might think, from what I've said, that a computer can only do what it's told to do.
Well, that's true that we made it start off like that, but it's only the start.
A computer can be made to learn.
Suppose, for example, that it was set to play chess.
It could find out for itself, in the light of its own experience, which are winning and which are losing strategies, and then drop the losing ones.
After a while, we wouldn't know what instructions it was actually using.
So it would hardly be fair to say that we had instructed it what to do.
That would be like crediting the master with any originality shown by the pupil.
The question thus arises as to whether or not we should credit such a machine with intelligence.
I would say we must.
You see, what I would very much like to do is to educate a computer, partly by direct training and partly by letting it find out things for itself.
And we don't know how to do this just yet, but I believe it will be achieved in the near future.
And I feel sure that by the year 2000, it will be considered perfectly correct to speak of an intelligent machine or to say that a computer is thinking.
Of course, not everyone agrees with this view.
Far from it.
Some people say that thinking is a function of man's immortal soul.
And since a machine has no soul, it cannot think.
Well, surely this is blasphemous.
Who are we to deny the possibility that God may wish to grant a soul to a machine?
And then there's what I call the heads in the sand objection.
The consequences of machines thinking are too dreadful to contemplate, people say.
Such a thing could never happen.
And this point of view is usually expressed by intellectuals.
They have the most to lose.
Another objection, and I hear this one very frequently,
is that a machine cannot be said to think until it can write a sonnet or compose a concerto.
Feel grief when its vowels fuse.
Be warmed by flattery.
Be angry or depressed when it can't get what it wants.
Well, of course, one might reply that there are very few human beings who can write a sonnet or compose a concerto.
And I can see no reason at all why a thinking machine should not be kind, resourceful and beautiful and friendly,
have a sense of humor, tell right from wrong and fall in love or enjoy strawberries and cream.
At the moment, these considerations should not concern us.
But it would be rather nice, don't you think, if one day we could find out what a machine can feel.
Did I tell you what happened to my brother?
Tuning.
Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Knox, what was that?
They were having a dinner party.
It was some time ago during the Blitz.
Eddie was just about to open a bottle of claret when a bomb fell nearby.
Tremendous explosion. Bang!
Guess what happened?
I have no idea.
The blast was so severe that the cork shot straight out of the bottle.
Isn't that amazing?
Eddie, of course, was quite unperturbed.
If only one could rely on it happening regularly, he said.
Why did I tell you that?
I mean, there was something on my mind.
What was it?
Damn, my memory's hopeless these days.
I have to write everything down.
Old age, that's the trouble.
We all live far too long.
My solicitor says that dentists are to blame.
Yes, yes, yes, you told me.
Did I?
Oh, oh.
Have you, um, hmm, have you been to London recently?
No, not for ages.
Oh, the bomb damage is frightful.
Rose McCauley says that walking through St. John's Wood is like walking through the ruins of Babylon.
Oh, I know why I told you that story.
Dinner party, bottles of claret, look, real scotch.
Would you like some?
Not for me, thank you.
No?
Actually, I don't like it.
Don't you?
Well, neither do I.
Isn't that a shame?
Somebody gave it to me.
It's very nice of them.
Ah, well, never mind.
I thought we should have a drink in honor of your trip to Washington.
I'm not going just yet.
No, it's all settled, though.
So I believe.
How do you feel about it?
Apprehensive, wouldn't you?
The Atlantic's a hazardous place.
As we both know, only too well I have nightmares about an ocean full of U-boats.
Ah, we'll all keep our fingers tightly crossed.
Oh, please do.
Actually, I'm rather intrigued.
I'm intrigued to see what our American counterparts are like, whether codebreakers have national
characteristics.
Most probably they do, don't you think?
I mean, look at us.
A benevolent patriarchy ruled by the upper middle class, independent yet conformist, cheerful
in the face of adversity, and underneath it all, deeply ruthless.
Ruthless?
Wouldn't you say?
Ruthless?
Don't you remember how we cheered when we'd heard we'd captured an Enigma codebook?
We only got it because a U-boat captain had been killed.
Nobody thought about that, not even me.
Well, I'd call that being realistic, not ruthless.
A bit of both, perhaps.
Oh, maybe.
Well, maybe you're right about national characteristics.
I mean, from what I know of the Americans, which isn't very much, they'll probably try to
persuade you that their methods are far superior to ours.
They're worried.
And who can blame them?
It doesn't seem unreasonable to me that they should want to know how we're tackling the
Enigma.
Oh, I suppose not.
And they're not being ungenerous, as I understand it.
They're prepared to tell us about their work on speech encipherment, and that could be
tremendously important.
Do you think so?
Oh, yes.
It's simply horrifying that all communication across the Atlantic have to go by shortwave
radio.
Anyone can listen.
Even with speech scramblers?
They're easily penetrated.
What's needed is an unbreakable speech encipherment system, but one doesn't exist.
Well, not yet, anyway.
It's important that you're going.
It is.
Oh, I mean, it's important that it's you who are going, and not some more conventional
representative.
Well, at least I know what I'm talking about.
And you're going with Churchill's personal authority.
Yes.
Well, that's important, too.
We're not very popular with the bureaucrats with the brass hats, au contraire.
And the fact that you're the one who's going to Washington is very significant.
Well, I think that's mostly Churchill's doing.
Oh, I'm sure of it.
He knows how vital your work is.
The geese who lay the golden eggs.
Isn't that what he said?
He meant all of us.
You in particular.
This is all very flattering, Knox.
You're making me feel uneasy.
Why is that?
I sense a sting in the tail approaching.
Not a sting, exactly.
I gather you've been chaining your tea mug to the radiator.
It's not an unreasonable precaution.
Tea mugs are in very short supply.
Well, some people find it irritating.
I find it irritating that some people should be irritated.
I've come to the conclusion that the old cliché of an eccentric artist is inaccurate.
Scientists carry eccentricity to far greater lengths.
Now, not just you, others.
Your friend Wittgenstein, for example.
Wittgenstein is not a scientist.
Oh, philosopher then, mathematician, does it matter?
Even you must agree that he's dauntingly eccentric and rude.
A friend of mine took me to meet him.
There he was, this distinguished fellow of Trinity,
sitting in a deck chair in a completely bare room.
My friend introduced me and said that I would be interested in attending one of his classes.
Wittgenstein looked at me with those cold, piercing eyes.
My lectures are not for tourists, he said.
He lives life as he chooses.
What's wrong with that?
Hmm.
I do think you ought to be a little more discreet.
About my tea mug?
About this young engineer chap you've got working with you.
Tongues are beginning to wag.
Am I in for a lesson in models?
In common sense.
I don't give a tumbley damn about your choice to go to bed with choir boys or cocker spaniels,
but it would be wiser to keep your private life to yourself.
Is this an official reprimand?
Friendly advice, nothing more.
I mean, look, first things first.
I mean, let's get our priorities right.
I mean, what we're doing here, and most especially what you're doing here,
has a direct and crucial bearing on the progress of the war.
A pretty young engineer comes a rather poor second to that, surely.
Nobody complained when I was working with Pat.
Oh, that was different.
Was it?
Well, of course it was.
Well, I thought you said rules only mattered in cricket.
Oh, it's such nonsense, this contemporary obsession with sexual fulfillment.
Passion is dreadfully overrated, if you ask me.
One is happiest when sex is a dimly remembered pleasure, like building sandcastles or climbing apple trees.
Well, you can hardly expect me to agree with that.
Like all of us, I can only speak from personal experience.
I have been happily married for over 20 years,
and I'm glad to say that passion has never played a significant role in our relationship.
Understanding and companionship can be relied upon.
Passion is forever fleeting.
Does that really matter?
Oh, it matters to me.
Perhaps one brief moment of passion is worth 20 years of uneventful companionship.
I didn't say it was uneventful.
Anyway, we're not talking about me, we're talking about you.
I hear you're not very well.
What's that got to do with it?
Nothing.
I was changing the subject.
Is it true?
I will.
I bear one thing in mind.
A great many people, administrators and the military alike,
regard Bletchley as a hotbed of anarchy and unruliness.
They pray for an excuse to bring us to heel.
The bureaucrats and the military should be bloody grateful to have me here.
Now, most of them have spent their lives in a world of rigid discipline.
Rank, routine, procedure, that's all they know.
Then you come along.
Work when you feel like it.
Complain about this, that, and the other.
Ignore what few rules we do have here.
And what's more, what's worse, you get away with it.
You succeed.
And can you blame them for disliking you?
You're small-minded, petty, spiteful.
Oh, well, maybe they are.
What's the point of having a system that gives authority to people who don't deserve it?
You say I complained.
Good God, of course I complained.
Nothing was being done.
You know that as well as I do.
We needed more staff.
More money.
And absolutely pucker all was being done about it.
If I hadn't written to Mr. Churchill, if I'd have gone through the so-called proper channels,
we'd all be stuck here twiddling our thumbs with the enigma unbroken.
Most of our merchant ships at the bottom of the Atlantic.
Yes, but these people do have...
People know what Churchill replied to my letter.
Do they?
Make sure they have all they want on extreme priority.
That's what he said.
I know.
Action this day.
Yes, I know.
And I'm not saying you did the wrong thing.
I'm just trying to explain why such unorthodox methods are bound to cause a considerable upset.
All that matters is the work we do.
Differences of attitude, differences of personality shouldn't come into it.
They shouldn't, but they do.
Then they should be ignored.
I think not.
Well, I do.
You can't go through life, Alan, ignoring the effect you have on other people
or the effect that other people have on you.
You can try.
You've spent far too much time thinking about your Turing machines.
We are, after all, human beings.
And you should try to accept the many imperfections that are part of a human condition.
Tolerate, perhaps.
Not accept.
Nevertheless, allowances have to be made.
Compromises have to be reached.
I beg to differ.
All right.
All right.
Let me give you an example.
A few minutes ago, you inquired about my health.
Suppose I had answered you directly.
Suppose I had told you that I am mortally ill and have only a year or so to live.
Suppose I had broken down and wept.
Suppose I had opened my heart to you and said that I had no wish to die, that I was frightened
and in despair.
I can't believe that you would have welcomed such a disclosure.
I feel sure that you'd have found it distressing, embarrassing, and somewhat inconsiderate.
And so, being aware of your feelings as well as my own, it would seem to be both correct
and appropriate for me to moderate my response.
Are you dying?
Similarly, or so it seems to me, when you reveal the nature of your sexuality, you cannot afford
to ignore the effect it's bound to have on other people.
Fear, for example.
Or when people are asked to accept something they do not understand.
Or anger, when what you so unashamedly reveal seems to be contrary to everything that they've
ever believed in.
And pain, you're bound to cause a lot of pain.
Not for yourself, necessarily.
That's your concern anyway.
But for people who are close to you, anyone who's fond of you, pain.
Real pain.
Speaking of Wittgenstein, he once wrote something that impressed me deeply.
I sat down there and then with a book in my hand and memorized what he'd written.
This is what he said.
We feel that even when all possible scientific questions have been answered, the problems
of life remain completely unanswered.
Alan, my dear, were you so silly?
Why didn't you tell me you were coming down?
I wasn't sure I'd be able to make it.
I didn't want to disappoint you.
Well, it's a wonderful surprise.
I'm delighted.
Oh, just look at that dreadful jacket.
I do wish you'd take more care of yourself.
How long can you stay?
Don't tell me you've got to go rushing back tomorrow morning.
I may have to.
Oh, never mind.
Don't let's think about that.
I've had the guest room completely redecorated.
Such lovely curtains.
Liberty print.
Mother, listen, I've got something to tell you.
Something nice?
I'm afraid not.
No.
You wouldn't have come all this way to tell me anything nice.
What is it?
Well, I'm in trouble.
What sort of trouble?
Serious trouble.
Tell me.
It's so difficult to explain.
Is it something to do with your work?
No.
Look, you know, I've never been very interested in women.
People of your sort seldom are.
My sort?
What do you mean, my sort?
People who spend their lives with their heads buried in books.
Oh, it's nothing to do with that.
What, then?
I've no sexual feeling for women.
That's probably just as well.
People seem to be getting divorced at such a rate these days.
Mother, listen.
Please listen.
I'm doing my best.
The police have discovered that I'm having an affair with a boy.
A boy?
Do you mean a Nancy boy?
Yes.
I'm sorry.
There's no other way to tell you.
I'm sorry.
Will it be in the papers?
I don't know.
Perhaps.
Have you told your brother?
Yes.
What did he say?
Shocked.
Terribly shocked.
Thank God your father isn't alive.
He was so proud of you.
Have you always...
I mean...
Have you always been like this?
Yes.
Always?
Yes.
But what about that girl you were engaged to?
What was her name?
Pat?
I was never engaged to her.
I thought you loved her.
I was fond of her.
I loved her as a friend.
What's going to happen?
Well, there'll be a trial.
They're sending you to court?
Yes.
When?
Soon, March, the end of March.
Will you go to prison?
Possibly.
How did the police find out?
Did they catch you?
Did they find you with this boy?
I told them.
Why?
Why?
Oh, Alan.
I'm sorry.
How could you bear to touch a man like that?
How could you do such a thing?
I'm sorry.
Will it affect your career?
I suppose so.
How?
I don't know.
What can I do to help?
Um...
Well, uh...
Nothing.
There must be something I can do.
Let me.
Please.
You look so helpless.
That's how I feel.
Do you remember when you were at Hazelhurst?
You must have been about ten or eleven.
We'd all been up to Scotland for the summer holidays.
Loch Invar.
Yes.
Daddy went trout fishing.
I sketched.
We had picnic teas in the heather.
And then we had to go back to India
and you had to go back to school,
back to Hazelhurst.
Yes.
Do you remember?
Of course I remember.
We took a taxi to the school
and as we drove away,
you tried to run after us.
You ran along the drive after the taxi.
Your arms were flung wide.
Your mouth was open.
You were saying something,
shouting something,
but I couldn't hear what it was.
There were some shrubs by the school gates.
Rhododendrons, I think.
It was like a great green curtain
being pulled across in front of my eyes.
The shrubs hid you from my sight.
I couldn't see you anymore.
For a moment I felt quite breathless with panic.
I wanted to jump out of the taxi,
run back,
and hold you in my arms forever.
Oh, Mother.
I had no idea you felt like this.
Do come and look at the guest room.
I'm so pleased with it.
Mr. Turing.
Sit down.
Make yourself comfortable.
You have to sign this first.
Got a pen?
What is it?
I, Alan Matheson Turing,
have been told by Detective Sergeant Ross
that I am not obliged to make any statement
and that what I now say may be given in evidence.
On that understanding,
I make the following statement.
But you didn't tell me that.
You didn't say I wasn't obliged to make a statement.
Didn't I, sir?
Um,
where do I sign?
There, look, underneath what I've written.
That's it, fine.
Right then, off you go.
What do you want me to say?
Just describe how you met Ron Miller
and what happened when he came to your house.
All right?
Yes.
Do you want me to give dates and so on?
If you can.
Well, um,
on December the 16th, 1951,
I met Ron Miller
in a public house
near the Oxford Road Station in Manchester.
I invited him to come to my house
on the following Friday evening.
Sorry I'm late.
Bully buses.
I've waited damn near half an hour.
Take your coat off.
I'll get you a drink.
I bet you thought I wouldn't show up.
Well, I thought you might have changed your mind.
I said I'd be here.
And here I am.
Are you glad to see me?
Of course.
Take your coat off.
It's a nice place.
You've been along?
I've just a few months, a year or so.
It's very nice.
Supper smells good.
Ah.
Well, I've prepared a sumptuous feast.
Homemade vegetable soup,
roast leg of lamb,
roast potatoes,
carrots and Brussels sprouts,
apple crumble for dessert.
All for a bloke you thought wouldn't show up.
Well, I hoped.
What about that drink?
What would you like?
Got a beer?
Wine or tizer?
Tizer.
Tizer, tizer, the appetizer.
I'm testing it for its electrical conductivity.
Why?
No reason.
It's what we call pure research.
What?
Nothing.
That was a joke.
Are you hungry?
Starving.
We had dinner.
A bottle of wine.
We talked about my work at the university.
Then I told him about war and peace.
About what?
A book by Tolstoy.
Someone had lent it to me.
I found it very impressive.
I don't like war stories.
Oh, it's not really a war story.
It's about two men.
One is called Andre.
The other one is Pierre.
Andre is ambitious, very energetic, but he's frightened of his own feelings.
The other one, Pierre, is an extraordinary man.
He's awkward, ugly, and rather shy, but he's full of goodwill and love.
I like Pierre.
He's a marvellous character.
I bet he gets killed.
Andre gets killed.
He gets shot at the Battle of Borodino.
It's a good book.
You ought to read it.
The Battle of what?
Borodino.
Never heard of it.
It's a place in Russia.
A famous battle.
I wasn't much good at history.
Well, now's your chance to learn.
I'll help you.
Let me get you a copy of the book.
It's very good, really.
Okay.
Give it a try.
Do read it.
Yeah, okay.
How about another drink?
Help yourself.
I'm sorry there's no beer.
I've got an old violin at home.
Ron thought it was great fun.
Oh, yes, sir.
I played a couple of tunes on it, and then Ron had a go.
And then we talked some more about my work.
How did it all start, then?
What?
You've been interested in science and things.
I've always been interested.
Well, even as a kid?
Even then, yes.
Yes, even then, when I was a child, numbers were my friends.
You what?
My friends.
You know how it is.
You know how children have their own secret, make-believe friends.
Friends who can always be trusted.
Well, my friends were numbers.
They were so wonderfully reliable, they never broke their own rules.
And then, when I was about nine or ten, an uncle gave me a book for Christmas, Natural Wonders Every Child Should Know.
I thought it was the most exciting book I'd ever read.
What the writer managed to convey was the idea that life, all life, is really a huge, all-embracing enterprise of science.
There was no nonsense about God or divine creation.
It was all science.
Chemicals, plants, animals, humans.
The body is a machine, he said.
How exciting it was to read that.
What an audacious, challenging, rather naughty idea that was.
He made life seem like a thrilling experiment, and I longed to take part in that experiment.
Come here.
Come and sit beside me.
And that's when the first offence occurred?
Yes.
Tell me what happened.
After supper, he told me about his work on the electronic brain.
Then he started talking about some books he'd read.
Then he asked me to sit next to him on the couch.
Then he opened me trousers.
Dear Mrs. Morecambe,
I want to say how sorry I am about Christopher.
I should be extremely grateful if you could find me sometimes a little snapshot of him.
I shall miss his face so, and the way he used to smile at me sideways.
We listened to the wireless of it, and he played cockles and muscles on his violin.
I had a go on it.
We went to bed about 11 o'clock.
He put a towel on the bed sheet.
In war and peace, there's a passage where Pierre meditates on his sense of shame.
I must endure what, he asks, the disgrace to my name and to my honour.
Oh, that's all rubbish, he cries.
Who is right and who is wrong?
No one.
While you're alive, live.
About 9 a.m., Turing got up and got dressed.
He left his jacket on the arm of a chair, and I knocked off eight pounds out of his jacket.
I went into the parlour again.
He leaned over me and put his head on my shoulder.
He pulled my hand onto his legs.
I wanked him again, but he never touched me.
One thing is certain.
A machine that is to imitate the brain must appear to behave as if it had free will.
What does that mean?
I did not do this for my own benefit sexually,
but I had heard that you could get paid for it.
I will never do it again if I'm given a chance.
I know that it's wrong.
Okay, Miller, wait outside.
Tolstoy said that free will is merely an expression
denoting what we do not know about the laws of human life.
Perhaps it's an illusion.
But without that illusion, life would be meaningless.
What on earth made you do it?
Do what?
Call the police.
Talk about asking for trouble.
What else could I do?
Sit still and keep quiet.
But I've been robbed.
Not exactly the crime of the century, was it?
Well, that rigmarole about a brush salesman?
I've never heard such rubbish in all my life.
You must think I'm a real prick.
I didn't want to involve Ron.
I had to say something, and I didn't want to involve Ron.
We'd have found out sooner or later.
Not necessarily.
Of course we would.
Questions get asked.
Answers lead to more questions.
Why is a middle-aged, unmarried professor spending the weekend with a bit of rough from the Oxford Road?
Doesn't take a genius to work that one out.
Look, I'd been robbed.
I knew George had robbed me.
Why the hell should he get away with it?
If I had said nothing, it'd be like giving into blackmail, and I refused to do that.
Okay, fine.
That's your decision.
But you must have known what would happen.
That didn't occur to me.
Didn't it, sir?
Not then.
Not at the time.
I didn't know you'd treat me like a criminal.
Not much choice, was there?
When a man says he's committed a crime, I can't just ignore it.
Going to bed with Ron is not a crime.
It's against the law.
It's not as simple as that.
Nothing ever is.
In your opinion.
And what's wrong with my opinion?
Look, I don't care what you and young Ron got up to.
But if it's against the law, I have to do something about it.
Okay.
Doesn't that worry you?
Why should it?
Because the law makes everything black and white.
Right, wrong.
Life's more complicated than that.
You mean sex.
Not just sex.
Well, what then?
All sorts of things.
Mathematics.
Even in mathematics.
There's no infallible rule for proving what is right and what is wrong.
Each problem, each decision requires fresh ideas.
Fresh thought.
And if that's the case in mathematics,
it makes the most reliable body of knowledge that mankind has created.
Surely, it might also apply in other, less certain areas.
It's okay as a theory, sir.
But it wouldn't work in real life.
Why not?
Decisions have to be made.
And if we can't decide what's right and what's wrong,
then we've got to get someone or something to decide for us.
All we've got is the law.
And in the present circumstances, that means me.
It's nothing personal, Mr. Turing.
I'm sorry this happened.
I understand how you must feel.
No, you don't.
How can you?
You're right, I don't.
I can't.
You'll receive official notification of the committal proceedings, sir.
Keep it simple when you're in court, sir.
All that stuff about mathematics wouldn't go down too well with the Wilmslow magistrates.
What did you get?
Spam sandwiches, fruitcake and lemonade.
Delicious.
It wasn't much of a choice, I'm afraid.
I should have taken you to a restaurant.
This is fun.
I love picnics.
It's good to see you, Broth.
It's good to see you.
Thank you for writing to me.
I wanted you to know what had happened.
I wanted you to hear it from me and not, um, well, secondhand.
Thank you.
It was in the News of the World, the Northern edition.
The headline said, Accused had powerful brain.
It could have been worse, I suppose.
Although that use of the past tense rather worried me.
I've thought about you a lot.
It must have been awful.
Actually, it was not as bad as I feared.
They put me in the cells during the trial.
Being behind bars was by no means disagreeable.
There was a wonderful absence of responsibility.
It's rather like being back at school.
Is that sandwich all right?
Fine.
Did you think they'd send you to prison?
No.
Not really.
I was a first offender, after all.
A first offender.
There's a laugh.
I thought they'd, uh, most probably put me on probation.
They're giving me drugs.
Who are?
They're giving me estrogen.
Female sex hormones.
It's supposed to kill all male sexual interest, but it's...
It's only for a year.
After that, everything returns to normal.
We hope.
That's dreadful.
Couldn't you refuse?
I'm obliged to do it.
I was placed on probation providing I agreed to the drug treatment.
And...
I'm growing breasts.
Oh, Alan.
Nobody seems to know whether they'll disappear when I stop taking the drugs.
We'll have to wait and see.
God, how dreadful.
The embarrassment factor is high.
Keep wondering whether I'll have to wear a bra.
Pretty awful going back to work after the trial.
Well, I didn't know how my colleagues would behave.
I feared the worst.
I was right.
There was a predictable reaction from my brother.
Brother John.
Brother John, yes.
Disgusted, repelled, incredulous, etc.
He said I'd been a silly ass to go to the police.
He was right.
What about your mother?
Oh, yes.
I dreaded telling her.
Absolutely dreaded it.
As it happened, she was wonderful about it.
Quite remarkable.
Seems to have drawn us closer together.
I'm glad.
Yes, so am I.
What happened to the boy?
Conditionally discharged.
He's working in London.
I think I never see him.
You're married?
Yes.
No job?
Just a housewife.
Are you happy?
Yes.
Well, I suppose so.
I don't think about it very much.
Well, that means you are.
Does it?
You only think about being happy when you're not.
Any children?
Two.
Two boys.
Oh, I'd like to have had children.
Is that a very sentimental thing to say?
Not in the least.
Well, it sounds sentimental, coming from an old poof like me.
Don't say things like that.
You're supposed to be a joke.
I hope you're not too unhappy.
I'm not unhappy at all.
I enjoy my work.
I have some good friends.
I had a very jolly holiday.
Norway.
Norway.
No legal problems in Norway.
And I met a charming young man called Kjell, who's promised to come and stay with me, all
being well, all fingers crossed.
What sort of work are you doing?
I'm at Manchester University.
Yes, I know.
We've built a digital computer.
Oh, Alan.
You remember all my theorizing about a universal machine?
Well, we've done it.
We've made one.
And it's all thanks to the war, really, and the work we did at Bletchley.
Why?
How?
Electronics.
Until we did it at Bletchley, nobody had thought of using electronics to carry out logical operations,
adding, multiplying, and so on.
And that's just what I needed.
Because to be of any practical use, a universal machine would have to carry out hundreds of
thousands of logical operations every second.
So electronics gave us the necessary speed, which left us with the problem of creating
an adequate memory.
If it's going to perform a reasonably significant task, a computer must keep a store of instructions
and information in its memory, roughly the same as the contents of an average book.
At first, we created a memory by using an acoustic delay line.
Using sound waves?
That's right.
It takes a thousandth of a second for a sound wave to travel along a few feet of pipe,
so the pipe would be regarded as storing the sound wave for that period.
The radar people used that idea during the war.
Yes.
We pinched the idea and used a delay line to store the pulses of an electronic computer.
But now, at Manchester, we're using little television screens, which means you can actually
see the numbers and instructions stored in the machine.
You can see them on the monitor tube, little bright spots.
How exciting.
It must be very exciting.
Well, it would be if the organization wasn't so rigid.
Everything is compartmentalized.
You're either a mathematician or an engineer.
You can't be both.
Unlike Bletchley?
Like Bletchley.
Totally unlike Bletchley.
More's the pity.
But at least I'm able to use the computer for my own work.
I've become increasingly interested in morphogenesis.
Embryology.
How do living things take shape?
How do they know how to grow?
I've got an idea that might explain how biological patterns arise, and I'm using the computer
to simulate growth patterns of plants and animals.
And I'm still baffled by the Fibonacci patterns in a fur cone.
Do you remember me telling you about that?
Yes.
One summer afternoon when you thought you were in love with me.
I went to church with your mother and cried all through the sermon.
You haven't changed at all.
That's nice of you to say so.
It's true.
It seems an awfully long time since Bletchley.
Doesn't it?
A lifetime.
I never found that silver.
What silver?
Those silver ingots I buried.
Oh, yes!
I searched high and low.
I never found them.
I wonder if your tea mug is still chained to the radiator.
Yes, I got ticked off about that.
Who by?
Dylan Knox.
Poor Mr. Knox.
I went to see him when he was ill.
Near the end.
That was good of you.
I was fond of him.
He had a house in the Chilterns, surrounded by trees.
Terribly damp.
And Mr. Knox kept apologizing for the drafts.
The only places where you can feel reasonably warm are my study and the airing cupboard, he said.
I suppose you heard about his romance with Maynard Keynes.
What?
Didn't you know?
Knox?
When he was young.
Are you sure?
An uncle of mine was at school with him.
Good God.
Lytton Strachey, too.
But that was at Cambridge, not Eton.
He was Lytton Strachey's lover?
Apparently.
Well, he never told me.
He never even dropped a hint.
I thought perhaps you knew.
I had the remotest idea.
I don't think anybody paid much attention to it.
Everything's so very different when you're at school or at Cambridge.
Good God almighty.
It was all a thing of the past.
He was devoted to his wife.
Yes, he told me.
That's the thing to do, of course.
Have your fling when you're young and conform later.
I should have married you.
All this would never have happened.
I should have played the game and stuck to the rules.
Why didn't you?
I couldn't.
Silly ass.
Yes.
Would you like an ice cream?
Oh, I'll get it.
My treat.
Wafer or cone?
Wafer.
No.
A cone.
Mr. Turing.
I'm so sorry to keep you waiting.
Everything's sixes and sevens today.
My secretary's gone down with flu,
and the temporary girl doesn't seem to know what she's doing.
Do sit down, won't you?
It's good of you to come along at such short notice.
Yes, thank you very much.
Your letter was rather vague.
Was it?
Official, but rather vague.
Well, it's just one of those things that are done better by meeting them by telephone.
Basically, it's just a question of keeping in touch.
What do you mean?
You're a brilliant man, Mr. Turing.
Unique in many ways.
And there's no point in trying to deny it.
I wasn't going to.
This country's always tended to take its brilliant men for granted,
and that's a mistake, a serious mistake.
And we cannot afford to make mistakes like that.
Who are you?
I've no idea who you are.
Sorry, sorry, sorry.
My name is Smith.
John Smith.
Nobody believes it.
I have a dreadful time with hotel clerks.
Anyway, the point is this.
It would be foolish to pretend that your homosexuality hasn't created certain problems, certain anxieties.
For whom?
But providing we can discuss the situation reasonably, I feel sure that these anxieties can be reduced to a minimum.
What anxiety?
As I say, it's just a question of keeping in touch.
You're talking about security problems?
Yes, I am.
Of course, I know you haven't been involved with intelligence work since your difficulty with the law.
Nevertheless, the knowledge remains, does it not?
You don't trust me.
We have to be careful, increasingly careful.
And it's not just us.
The Americans are getting jumpy.
They've given you access to some very sensitive information.
For instance, the speech encipherment material.
An unguarded word could so easily fall into the wrong ears.
There is a general feeling of unease.
About me?
We know that you are a man of the greatest integrity.
Your essential loyalty has never been questioned.
But?
All possibilities have to be considered.
Such as?
Can you, in all honesty, say that you would never, never under any circumstances, reveal something of your work to a sexual partner?
No.
Of course not.
No, you would.
Or no, you wouldn't.
No, I can't say, in all honesty, that such a circumstance would never arise.
Neither can you.
Who could?
That being the case, one's attention is drawn to the choice of partner.
It seems that you have an unusually wide range of acquaintances.
You mean it would be all right if I went to bed with other mathematicians?
Preferably from one of the older universities.
Preferably from one of the more distinguished public schools.
Preferably with what the Americans call security clearance.
I'm sure that would make us all a lot happier.
I'm sorry, sorry, that was rather glib.
But you must realize that your work for the intelligence service means that you're simply not free to behave as you might choose.
You have had extremely unusual access to secret information.
This carries with it a heavy and sometimes irksome responsibility.
I am aware of that.
Yes, yes, I'm sure you are.
Look, it may seem like interference.
In fact, we're trying to be helpful.
Kiel.
Oh.
How?
By preventing any further errors of judgment.
Meaning what exactly?
This young Norwegian.
Kiel.
I think it would be unwise for him to visit you here.
How do you know about Kiel?
Somebody told me.
Who?
I forget.
Truly.
Am I being watched?
You're a valuable man.
You have valuable information stored away inside that, what do you call it, that bowl of cold porridge.
Oh, I have a nephew at Sherborne.
He was most impressed by your lecture there recently.
We have to make sure that this knowledge is properly protected.
When you say keeping in touch, what precisely do you mean?
We'd like to be told about any change of residence, any change in your working life, trips abroad, that sort of thing.
Are you planning to go abroad this year?
Yes, I'm going to Greece.
Oh, when?
May.
Whereabouts in Greece?
Corfu.
Oh.
Oh, it's very nice there.
You'll like it a lot.
And May is the perfect time to go.
I want you to know that I have no regrets about my involvement with the intelligence service.
The work I did at Bletchley was very important to me.
Yes, I'm sure.
Important in a way that you probably cannot understand.
Everything came together there, all the strands of my life, my work as a mathematician, my interest in ciphers, my ability to solve practical problems, and my love of my country.
For a year or so, I felt I had found what I had been searching for.
Are you really asleep?
Or are you just pretending?
Nikos from Ipsos.
Never before have I been to bed with someone I couldn't talk to.
Oh, the Greek phrase book doesn't cover these circumstances, alas.
Half past five.
That means it's, what, half past three at home.
I'll soon be having tea and buns in the laboratory.
Oh, my gosh, look at that wireless.
It's a real museum piece.
It doesn't work.
Never mind.
Mustn't expect too much in this life.
Then do levy.
It doesn't work.
Then do levy.
Your wireless doesn't work.
In espasmeno.
Is that what you're telling me?
Are you saying this thing doesn't work?
In espasmeno.
I'll mend it for you, shall I?
Would you like me to do that?
Shall I try to mend it?
Then cut a levy.
Perhaps I can mend it.
Would you like me to try?
I'm rather good at that sort of thing.
Mend it.
Me.
Mend it.
Wireless.
Okay?
I need a screwdriver to loosen the screws.
Do you have a screwdriver?
Oh, let's have a look at this thing.
I've always taken a particular pride in my practical skills.
What's the point of being a theorist if you can't put your theories into practice?
Katsaviri.
Oh, good.
You found one.
Katsaviri.
Thank you.
Katsaviri.
Oh, oh, that's the word, is it?
Katsaviri.
Katsaviri.
Katsaviri.
Yeah, yeah.
Katsaviri.
Well, that's wonderful.
Thank you very much.
If ever I need to buy a screwdriver in Greece, I'll know what to ask for, won't I?
Oh, I see.
What's wrong with it?
You're a very good listener.
Nikos from Ipsos.
You ought to have been a Jungian analyst.
I went to an analyst for a time about a couple of years ago.
There'd been some trouble with the police.
I told him everything.
Almost.
You just sit there and listen.
Rather like you, Nikos from Ipsos.
Nikos.
Listen and listen and listen.
The idea, you see, the basis of all Jungian analysis was to integrate thinking and feeling.
It's a tall order in my case.
Right, good.
That should work now.
Switch it on.
Thank you.
Thank you.
That's enough.
Well, I have no idea what that was all about.
Well, I'm glad you're so pleased.
Oh, thank you.
Thank you, Nikos.
It's a good feeling, isn't it?
Solving a problem.
Finding the answer.
Making it work.
It's a good feeling.
It's all like that wireless.
Really, it's all a question of making the right connections.
Shall I tell you a secret?
It's top secret.
Couldn't even tell my analyst about this.
Since you won't understand a single word, it really doesn't matter.
It all took place at the beginning of the war.
The Germans had built a machine called the Enigma.
It was very cunning.
It made codes, and the Germans believed it was completely foolproof, unbreakable.
And somehow we had to break it.
If we didn't, if we couldn't, we'd lose the war.
It was as simple as that.
The machine itself didn't look very complicated.
It was rather like a typewriter.
A few had been captured, you see, so we knew how it worked.
It was a typewriter keyboard, and behind the keyboard, three rotors.
The letters of the alphabet were on each rotor.
When you pressed the letter on the keyboard, electricity flowed along a wire to the rotors and out again.
As a result, one letter was encoded into another.
An A, for example, would be encoded into an M.
And at the same time, the rotors turned, so that if you pressed A again, it would be encoded into a different letter.
A W, perhaps a P, an S, whatever.
And the jumbled-up message would be decoded by an operator with another Enigma machine.
He'd also know the starting point of the rotor positions, which were changed every day.
This was central to the whole system.
Everything rested on those rotor positions, which were transmitted secretly and separately,
and which we had no means of guessing.
The three rotors created 26 times 26 times 26 permutations.
17,576.
With a degree of patience, it was possible, possible, to find the right rotor position.
But what made the system virtually unbreakable was the fact that the Germans had attached a plug board to the Enigma machine.
It was like a telephone switchboard.
You just connected pairs of letters with a jack plug, an A with an M, say, and they swapped the letters before they were fed into the rotors.
And this resulted in thousands of millions of possible permutations, and this was the problem we had to solve.
Where to begin?
Well, first, there was guesswork.
The code-breaking process always begins with a guess.
We had to guess what the first few words of the message were.
This wasn't as difficult as it sounds, because military messages invariably start with a stereotyped phrase.
The date, the time, the name and rank of the sender, that sort of thing.
And we were lucky at Bletchley, we had a wonderfully good guesser, Dylan Knox.
His guesses were almost always right.
And then we discovered that it was possible to use the few words we'd guessed to form a chain of implications,
of logical deductions for each of the rotor positions.
If this chain of implications led you to a contradiction, which was usually the case, it means you're wrong,
and you have to move to the next position, and so on, and so on, and so on.
An impossibly lengthy and laborious task, but in essence, a mechanical one.
And so, we designed and built an entirely new sort of machine to do the job for us.
Inside, rotors like the Enigma, and the rotors would spin round, trying several possible positions every second.
At each position, electricity flowed, stopping only when a consistent rotor and plugboard position was reached.
The trouble was, it was still too slow, far too slow.
Speed was essential, and our machines would take days, sometimes weeks, to reach a solution.
And then, one afternoon, I remembered a conversation I'd had with Wittgenstein some months before.
We were arguing about the fact that a contradiction implies any proposition.
Wittgenstein said this was just a useless language game.
But on that spring afternoon at Bletchley, I saw immediately how this idea could have a practical application to our code-breaking machine.
If your guess is wrong, then the electricity would flow through all the other hypotheses and knock them out in a flash,
like a chain reaction in an atomic bomb.
If your guess is correct, everything would be consistent,
and the electrical current wouldn't flow past the correct combination.
By using this idea, our machine could examine thousands of millions of permutations at amazing speed
and could thus reach a solution in hours rather than days.
We'd found the way in.
More than that, all the connections had been made.
There was the pure beauty of the logical pattern, the human element,
the deeply satisfying relationship between the theoretical and the practical.
What a moment that was.
Quite, quite extraordinary.
It was a wonderfully sunny day.
I remember the lawn had just been cut.
The smell of freshly mown grass was everywhere.
And I could hear a wireless playing in one of the huts.
Dance music, a silly tune that was very popular in those days.
It's a hap-hap-happy day, doodle-oo-doodle-ay,
for you and me, for us and we.
In the long run, all things considered,
it's not breaking the code that matters.
It's where you go from there.
That's the real problem.
Oh, Christopher.
If only you could have been there.
Never again.
Never again a moment like that.
PHONE RINGS
Hello, Ross?
Oh, OK, fine.
Come in, Mrs. Turing.
Do sit down.
Can I get you a cup of tea or something?
A cup of coffee?
No, thank you.
Right.
These are your son's personal belongings.
As you know, a few odds and ends had to be examined
before the coroner could complete his report.
Here's a list.
You'd better make sure everything's there.
Do I have to?
No, not if it upsets you.
I think I'd rather not.
I kept this separately.
It's his medal, his OBE.
I was afraid it might get lost.
Thank you.
If you'll just sign here, please.
Good.
Thank you.
I didn't know he'd got the OBE.
He never told me.
What was it for?
The work he did during the war.
Whatever that was.
There are so many things I know nothing about.
So many things I don't understand.
Yes.
It's a sad business.
I'm very sorry.
Of course, it was all a dreadful mistake.
In what way?
The coroner's verdict.
Ah, well...
To say that my son took his own life is quite ridiculous.
Everyone knew he did experiments at home
and he never washed his hands.
Never.
It was obviously a tragic accident.
The coroner's verdict is a disgrace.
I can't really offer an opinion, Mrs. Turing.
You met him.
Do you think he was the sort of man to commit suicide?
It's been two or three years since I've seen him
and you never know what people might do
in extreme circumstances.
Let me tell you something about my son.
His first day at Sherbourne
was also the first day of the general strike.
He bicycled all the way from Southampton to Sherbourne.
Sixty miles.
So that he would be sure of getting to school on time.
It was reported in the local newspaper.
A boy who could do that would never take his own life.
He had everything to live for.
Everything.
What is needed is the ability to take ideas seriously
and to follow them through to their logical,
if upsetting, conclusion?
Thus, can the mind exist without the body?
Can mental processes take place in something other than a living brain?
How are we to answer this question satisfactorily?
Is it possible to do so?
Or is it simply unprovable?
An eternal,
in Shidong's problem,
forever undecidable?
Being a practical man,
as well as a theorist,
I tend to look for practical solutions.
In this case, namely,
these to dispose of the body
and to release what is left,
a mind
or a nothing.
Here,
I have an ordinary apple,
red and ripe
and English.
And here,
a tin containing potassium cyanide.
Nothing could be easier, could it?
Dip the apple
in the brew.
Let
the seeping death
seep through.
