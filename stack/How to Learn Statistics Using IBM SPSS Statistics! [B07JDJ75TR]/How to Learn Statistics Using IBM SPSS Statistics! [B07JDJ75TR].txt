Narrated by Jason Zenobia
Chapter 1. Introduction
Sample Files
Most of the examples that are presented here use the data file demo.save
This data file is a fictitious survey of several thousand people
containing basic demographic and consumer information.
If you are using the student version,
your version of demo.save is a representative sample of the original data file,
reduced to meet the 1500 case limit.
Results that you obtain using that data file will differ from the results shown here.
The sample files installed with the product
can be found in the samples subdirectory of the installation directory.
There is a separate folder within the samples subdirectory
for each of the following languages.
English, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Russian,
simplified Chinese, Spanish, and traditional Chinese.
Not all sample files are available in all languages.
If a sample file is not available in a language,
that language folder contains an English version of the sample file.
Opening a Data File
To open a data file,
E from the menus choose File, Open, Data.
Alternatively, you can use the Open File button on the toolbar.
Figure 1-1
Open File Toolbar button
A dialog box for opening files is displayed.
One, by default, IBM SPSS Statistics Data Files, .save extension, are presented.
This example uses the file demo.save
Figure 1-2
Demo.save file in Data Editor
The data file is displayed in the Data Editor.
In the Data Editor, if you put the mouse cursor on a variable name, the column headings,
a more descriptive variable label is displayed, if a label has been defined for that variable.
By default, the actual data values are displayed.
To display labels, E, from the menus choose View, Value Labels.
Alternatively, you can use the Value Labels button on the toolbar.
Figure 1-3
Value Labels Button
Descriptive Value Labels are now displayed to make it easier to interpret the responses.
Figure 1-4
Value Labels Displayed in the Data Editor
Running an Analysis
If you have any add-on options, the Analyze menu contains a list of reporting and statistical analysis categories.
We will start by creating a simple frequency table, Table of Counts.
This example requires the Statistics Base option.
E
From the menus, choose Analyze, Descriptive Statistics, Frequencies.
The Frequencies Dialog box is displayed.
Figure 1-5
Frequencies Dialog Box
An icon next to each variable provides information about data type and level of measurement.
E
Click the Variable Income Category in Thousands
In-Cat
Figure 1-6
Variable Labels and Names in the Frequencies Dialog Box
If the variable label and or name appears truncated in the list, the complete label name is displayed when the cursor is positioned over it.
The variable name in cat is displayed in square brackets after the descriptive variable label.
Income Category in Thousands is the variable label.
If there were no variable label, only the variable name would appear in the list box.
You can resize dialog boxes just like windows by clicking and dragging the outside borders or corners.
For example, if you make the dialog box wider, the variable lists will also be wider.
Figure 1-7
Resized Dialog Box
In the dialog box, you choose the variables that you want to analyze from the source list on the left and drag and drop them into the variables list on the right.
The OK button, which runs the analysis, is disabled until at least one variable is placed in the variables list.
In many dialogs, you can obtain additional information by right-clicking any variable name in the list.
E
Right-click Income Category in Thousands, in Cat, and choose Variable Information.
E
Click the down arrow on the Value Labels drop-down list.
Figure 1-8

Chapter 2.
Reading Data
Data can be entered directly or it can be imported from a number of different sources.
The processes for reading data stored in IBM SPSS statistics data files, spreadsheet applications such as Microsoft Excel, database applications such as Microsoft Access, and text files are all discussed in this chapter.
Basic Structure of IBM SPSS statistics data files are organized by cases, rows, and variables, columns.
In this data file, cases represent individual respondents to a survey, variables represent responses to each question asked in the survey.
Reading IBM SPSS statistics data files, IBM SPSS statistics data files, which have a .save file extension, contain your saved data.
To open demo.save, an example file installed with the product, E, from the menus choose File, Open, Data, E, Browse to and Open, Demo.save.
The data are now displayed in the data editor.
Figure 2-2.
Opened Data File
Reading Data from Spreadsheets
Rather than typing all of your data directly into the data editor, you can read data from applications such as Microsoft Excel.
You can also read column headings as variable names.
E. From the menus, choose File, Open, Data.
E. Select Excel, .xls, as the file type you want to view.
E. Open, Demo, .xls, the Opening Excel Data Source Dialog box is displayed, allowing you to specify whether variable names are to be included in the spreadsheet, as well as the cells that you want to import.
In Excel 95 or later, you can also specify which worksheets you want to import.
Figure 2-3.
Opening Excel Data Source Dialog box.
E. Make sure that Read Variable Names from the first row of data is selected.
This option reads Column Headings as Variable Names.
If the column headings do not conform to the IBM SPSS Statistics Variable Naming rules, they are converted into valid variable names, and the original column headings are saved as variable labels.
If you want to import only a portion of the spreadsheet, specify the range of cells to be imported in the Range Text box.
E. Click OK to read the Excel file.
The data now appear in the Data Editor with the column headings used as variable names.
Since variable names can't contain spaces, the spaces from the original column headings have been removed.
For example, Marital Status in the Excel file becomes the variable Marital Status.
The original column heading is retained as a variable label.
Figure 2-4.
Imported Excel Data
Reading Data from a Database
Data from database sources are easily imported using the Database Wizard.
Any database that uses ODBC, Open Database Connectivity Drivers, can be read directly after the drivers are installed.
ODBC drivers for many database formats are supplied on the installation CD.
Additional drivers can be obtained from third-party vendors.
One of the most common database applications, Microsoft Access, is discussed in this example.
Note.
This example is specific to Microsoft Windows and requires an ODBC driver for access.
The steps are similar on other platforms but may require a third-party ODBC driver for access.
E.
From the menus, choose File, Open Database, New Query.
Figure 2-5.
Database Wizard Welcome Dialog Box
E.
Select MS Access Database from the list of data sources and click Next.
Note.
Depending on your installation, you may also see a list of OLEDB data sources on the left side of the wizard, Windows Operating Systems only.
But this example uses the list of ODBC data sources displayed on the right side.
Figure 2-6.
ODBC Driver Login Dialog Box
E.
Click Browse to navigate to the Access Database file that you want to open.
E.
Open Demo.mdb
E.
Click OK in the Login Dialog Box.
In the next step, you can specify the tables and variables that you want to import.
Figure 2-7.
Select Data Step
E.
Drag the entire demo table to the Retrieve Fields in This Order list.
E.
Click Next.
In the next step, you select which records, cases, to import.
Figure 2-8.
Limit Retrieved Cases Step
If you do not want to import all cases, you can import a subset of cases.
For example, males older than 30.
Or you can import a random sample of cases from the data source.
For large data sources, you may want to limit the number of cases to a small representative sample to reduce the processing time.
E.
Click Next to continue.
Field names are used to create variable names.
If necessary, the names are converted to valid variable names.
The original field names are preserved as variable labels.
You can also change the variable names before importing the database.
Figure 2-9.
Define Variables Step
E.
Click the Recode to Numeric cell in the Gender field.
This option converts strings of variables to integer variables and retains the original value as the value label for the new variable.
E.
Click Next to continue.
The SQL statement created from your selections in the database wizard appears in the Results step.
This statement can be executed now or saved to a file for later use.
Figure 2-10.
Results Step
E.
Click Finish to import the data.
All of the data in the Access database that you selected to import are now available in the Data Editor.
Figure 2-11.
Data imported from an Access database.
Reading data from a text file.
Text files are another common source of data.
Many spreadsheet programs and databases can save their contents in one of many text file formats.
Comma or tab-delimited files refer to rows of data that use commas or tabs to indicate each variable.
In this example, the data are tab-delimited.
E.
From the menus, choose File, Read Text Data.
E.
Select Text.txt as the file type you want to view.
E.
Open Demo.txt.
The Text Import Wizard guides you through the process of defining how the specified text file should be interpreted.
Figure 2-12.
Text Import Wizard.
Step 1 of 6.
E.
In Step 1, you can choose a predefined format or create a new format in the wizard.
Select No to indicate that a new format should be created.
E.
Click Next to continue.
As stated earlier, this file uses tab-delimited formatting.
Also, the variable names are defined on the top line of this file.
Figure 2-13.
Text Import Wizard.
Step 2 of 6.
E.
Select Delimited to indicate that the data use a delimited formatting structure.
E.
Select Yes to indicate that variable names should be read from the top of the file.
E.
Click Next to continue.
E.
Type 2 in the top section of Next dialog box to indicate that the first row of data starts on the second line of the text file.
Figure 2-14.
Text Import Wizard.
Step 3 of 6.
E.
Keep the default values for the remainder of this dialog box and click Next to continue.
The data preview in Step 4 provides you with a quick way to ensure that your data are being adequately read.
Figure 2-15.
Text Import Wizard.
Step 4 of 6.
E.
Select Tab and deselect the other options.
E.
Click Next to continue.
Because the variable names may have been truncated to fit formatting requirements, this dialog box gives you the opportunity to edit any undesirable names.
Figure 2-16.
Text Import Wizard Step 5 of 6.
Data types can be defined here as well.
For example, it's safe to assume that the income variable is meant to contain a certain dollar amount.
To change a data type.
To change a data type.
E.
Under Data Preview, select the variable you want to change, which is income in this case.
E.
Select dollar from the data format drop-down list.

Change the data type.
E.
Click Next to continue.
Figure 2-18.
Text Import Wizard Step 6 of 6.
E.
Leave the default selections in this dialog box and click Finish to import the data.
The data editor displays the contents of the existing data file.
The information in the data editor consists of variables and cases.
In data view, columns represent variables and rows represent cases, observations.
In variable view, each row is a variable and each column is an attribute that is associated with that variable.
Variables are used to represent the different types of data that you have compiled.
A common analogy is that of a survey.
The response to each question on a survey is equivalent to a variable.
Variables come in many different types, including numbers, strings, currency, and dates.
Entering Numeric Data
Data can be entered into the data editor, which may be useful for small data files or for making minor edits to larger data files.
E.
Click the Variable View tab at the bottom of the data editor window.
You need to define the variables that will be used.
In this case, only three variables are needed.
Age, marital status, and income.
E.
In the first row of the first column, type age.
E.
In the second row, type marital.
E.
In the third row, type income.
New variables are automatically given a numeric data type.
If you don't enter variable names, unique names are automatically created.
However, these names are not descriptive and are not recommended for large data files.
E.
Click the Data View tab to continue entering the data.
The names that you entered in Variable View are now the headings for the first three columns in Data View.
Begin entering data in the first row, starting at the first column.
E.
In the age column, type 55.
E.
In the marital column, type 1.
E.
In the income column, type 7200.
E.
Move the cursor to the second row of the first column to add the next subject's data.
E.
In the age column, type 53.
E.
In the marital column, type 0.
E.
In the income column, type 153000.
Currently, the age and marital columns display decimal points, even though their values are intended to be integers.
To hide the decimal points in these variables,
E.
Click the Variable View tab at the bottom of the data editor window.
E.
In the decimals column of the age row, type 0 to hide the decimal.
E.
In the decimals column of the marital row, type 0 to hide the decimal.
Entering string data.
Non-numeric data, such as strings of text, can also be entered into the data editor.
E.
Click the Variable View tab at the bottom of the data editor window.
E.
In the first cell of the first empty row, type sex for the variable name.
E.
Click the Type cell next to your entry.
E.
Click the button on the right side of the type cell to open the Variable Type dialog box.
E.
Select String to specify the variable type.
E.
Click OK to save your selection and return to the data editor.
Defining Data
In addition to defining data types, you can also define descriptive variable labels and
value labels for variable names and data values.
These descriptive labels are used in statistical reports and charts.
Adding Variable Labels
Labels are meant to provide descriptions of variables.
These descriptions are often longer versions of variable names.
Labels can be up to 255 bytes.
These labels are used in your output to identify the different variables.
E.
Click the Variable View tab at the bottom of the data editor window.
E.
In the label column of the age row, type Respondent's Age.
E.
In the label column of the marital row, type Marital Status.
E.
In the label column of the income row, type Household Income.
E.
In the label column of the sex row, type Gender.
Changing Variable Type and Format
The Type column displays the current data type for each variable.
The most common data types are numeric and string, but many other formats are supported.
In the current data file, the income variable is defined as a numeric type.
E.
Click the Type cell for the income row, and then click the button on the right side of the cell
to open the Variable Type dialog box.
E.
Select Dollar.
The formatting options for the currently selected data type are displayed.
E.
For the format of the currency in this example, select Dollar Sign, Hashtag, Hashtag, Hashtag,
Comma, Hashtag, Hashtag, Hashtag, Comma, Hashtag, Hashtag, Hashtag.
E.
Click OK to save your changes.
Adding Value Labels for Numeric Variables
Value labels provide a method for mapping your variable values to a string label.
In this example, there are two acceptable values for the marital variable.
A value of 0 means that the subject is single, and a value of 1 means that he or she is married.
E.
Click the Values cell for the marital row, and then click the button on the right side
of the cell to open the Value Labels dialog box.
The value is the actual numeric value.
The value label is the string label that is applied to the specific numeric value.
E.
E.
Type 0 in the value field.
E.
Type single in the label field.
E.
Click Add to add this label to the list.
E.
Type 1 in the value field and type married in the label field.
E.
Click Add and then click OK to save your changes and return to the data editor.
These labels can also be displayed in Data View, which can make your data more readable.
E.
Click the Data View tab at the bottom of the data editor window.
E.
From the menus, choose View Value Labels.
The labels are now displayed in a list when you enter values in the data editor.
This setup has the benefit of suggesting a valid response and providing a more descriptive answer.
If the Value Labels menu item is already active, with a checkmark next to it, choosing Value Labels again will turn off the display of Value Labels.
Adding Value Labels for String Variables
String variables may require value labels as well.
For example, your data may use single letters, M or F, to identify the sex of the subject.
Value Labels can be used to specify that M stands for male and F stands for female.
E.
Click the Variable View tab at the bottom of the data editor window.
E.
Click the Values cell in the sex row, and then click the button on the right side of the cell to open the Value Labels dialog box.
E.
Type F in the value field, and then type female in the label field.
E.
Click Add to add this label to your data file.
E.
E.
Type M in the value field, and type male in the label field.
E.
Click Add, and then click OK to save your changes and return to the data editor.
E.
Because string values are case-sensitive, you should be consistent.
A lowercase, M, is not the same as an uppercase, M.
Using Value Labels for Data Entry
You can use value labels for data entry.
E.
Click the Data View tab at the bottom of the data editor window.
E.
In the first row, select the cell for sex.
E.
Click the button on the right side of the cell, and then choose Male from the drop-down list.
E.
In the second row, select the cell for sex.
Click the button on the right side of the cell, and then choose Female from the drop-down list.
Only defined values are listed, which ensures that the entered data are in a format that you expect.
Handling Missing Data
Missing or invalid data are generally too common to ignore.
Survey respondents may refuse to answer certain questions, may not know the answer, or may answer in an unexpected format.
If you don't filter or identify these data, your analysis may not provide accurate results.
For numeric data, empty data fields or fields containing invalid entries are converted to System Missing, which is identified by a single period.
The reason a value is missing may be important to your analysis.
For example, you may find it useful to distinguish between those respondents who refused to answer a question, and those respondents who didn't answer a question because it was not applicable.
Missing Values for a Numeric Variable
E.
Click the Variable View tab at the bottom of the Data Editor window.
E.
Click the Missing cell in the Age row, and then click the button on the right side of the cell to open the Missing Values dialog box.
In this dialog box, you can specify up to three distinct missing values, or you can specify a range of values plus one additional discrete value.
Select Discrete Missing Values.
E.
Type 999 in the first text box and leave the other two text boxes empty.
E.
Click OK to save your changes and return to the Data Editor.
Now that the Missing Data value has been added, a label can be applied to that value.
E.
Click the Values cell in the Age row, and then click the button on the right side of the cell to open the Value Labels dialog box.
E.
Type 999 in the Value field.
E.
Type No Response in the Label field.
E.
E.
Click Add to add this label to your data file.
E.
Click OK to save your changes and return to the Data Editor.
Missing Values for a String Variable
Missing Values for String Variables are handled similarly to the missing values for Numeric Variables.
However, unlike Numeric Variables, empty fields in String Variables are not designated as System Missing.
Rather, they are interpreted as an empty string.
E.
Click the Variable View tab at the bottom of the Data Editor window.
E.
Click the Missing cell in the Sex row, and then click the button on the right side of the cell to open the Missing Values dialog box.
E.
Select Discrete Missing Values.
E.
Type N, R in the first text box.
Missing Values for String Variables are case-sensitive, so a value of lowercase nr is not treated as a missing value.
Click OK to save your changes and return to the Data Editor.
Now you can add a label for the missing value.
E.
Click the Values cell in the Sex row, and then click the button on the right side of the cell to open the Value Labels dialog box.
E.
Type N, R in the Value field.
E.
Type N, R in the Value field.
E.
Click Add to add this label to your project.
E.
Click OK to save your changes and return to the Data Editor.
Copying and Pasting Variable Attributes.
After you've defined variable attributes for a variable, you can copy these attributes and apply them to other variables.
In Variable View, type Age Wed in the first cell of the first empty row.
E.
In the Label column, type Age Married.
E.
Click the Values cell in the Age row.
E.
From the menus, choose Edit, Copy.
E.
Click the Values cell in the Age Wed row.
E.
From the menus, choose Edit, Paste.
The defined values from the Age variable are now applied to the Age Wed variable.
To apply the attribute to multiple variables, simply select multiple target cells.
Click and drag down the column.
When you paste the attribute, it is applied to all of the chosen cells.
New variables are automatically created if you paste the values into empty rows.
To copy all attributes from one variable to another variable,
E.
Click the row number in the marital row.
E.
From the menus, choose Edit, Copy.
E.
Click the row number of the first empty row.
E.
From the menus, choose Edit, Paste.
All attributes of the marital variable are applied to the new variable.
Defining Variable Properties for Categorical Variables
For categorical, nominal-ordinal data,
you can use Define Variable Properties to define value labels and other variable properties.
The Define Variable Properties process
Scans the actual data values and lists all unique data values for each selected variable.
Identifies unlabeled values and provides an auto-label feature.
Provides the ability to copy defined value labels from another variable to the selected variable,
or from the selected variable to additional variables.
This example uses the data file Demo.save.
This data file already has defined value labels,
so we will enter a value for which there is no defined value label.
E.
In Data View of the Data Editor,
click the first data cell for the variable Own PC.
You may have to scroll to the right,
and then enter 99.
E.
From the menus, choose Data, Define Variable Properties.
In the initial Define Variable Properties dialog box,
you select the nominal or ordinal variables
for which you want to define value labels and other properties.
You might notice that the measurement level icons for all of the selected variables
indicate that they are scale variables, not categorical variables.
All of the selected variables in this example are really categorical variables
that use the numeric values 0 and 1 to stand for no and yes, respectively.
And one of the variable properties that we'll change with Define Variable Properties
is the measurement level.
E.
Click Continue.
E.
In the scanned variable list, select Own PC.
The current level of measurement for the selected variable is Scale.
You can change the measurement level by selecting a level from the drop-down list.
Or you can let Define Variable Properties suggest a measurement level.
E.
Click Suggest.
The Suggest Measurement Level dialog box is displayed.
Because the variable doesn't have very many different values
and all of the scanned cases contain integer values,
the proper measurement level is probably Ordinal or Nominal.
E.
Select Ordinal and then click Continue.
The measurement level for the selected variable is now Ordinal.
The Value Label grid displays all of the unique data values for the selected variable.
Any defined value labels for these values and the number of times
count that each value occurs in the scanned cases.
The value that we entered in Data View, 99, is displayed in the grid.
The count is only 1 because we changed the value for only one case.
And the label column is empty because we haven't defined a value label for 99 yet.
An X in the first column of the scanned variable list also indicates that the selected variable
has at least one observed value without a defined value label.
E.
In the Label column for the value of 99, enter No Answer.
E.
Check the box in the Missing column for the value 99 to identify the value 99 as User Missing.
Data values that are specified as User Missing are flagged for special treatment
and are excluded from most calculations.
Before we complete the job of modifying the variable properties for Own PC,
let's apply the same measurement level, value labels, and missing values definitions
to the other variables in the list.
E.
In the Copy Properties area, click Two Other Variables.
E.
In the Apply Labels and Level dialog box, select all of the variables in the list and then click Copy.
If you select any other variable in the scanned variable list of the Define Variable Properties
main dialog box now, you'll see that they are all ordinal variables with a value of
99 defined as User Missing and a value label of No Answer.
E.
Click OK to save all of the variable properties that you have defined.
Chapter 4.
Working with Multiple Data Source.
Starting with version 14.0, multiple data sources can be open at the same time, making it easier
to switch back and forth between data sources, compare the contents of different data sources,
copy and paste data between data sources, create multiple subsets of cases and or variables
for analysis.
Merge multiple data sources from various data formats, for example, spreadsheet, database,
text data, without saving each data source first.
Basic Handling of Multiple Data Sources.
By default, each data source that you open is displayed in a new Data Editor window.
Any previously opened data sources remain open and available for further use.
When you first open a data source, it automatically becomes the active data set.
You can change the active data set simply by clicking anywhere in the Data Editor window of
the data source that you want to use or by selecting the Data Editor window for that data source from
the Window menu.
Only the variables in the active data set are available for analysis.
You cannot change the active data set when any dialog box that accesses the data is open,
including all dialog boxes that display variable lists.
At least one Data Editor window must be open during a session.
When you close the last open Data Editor window, IBM SPSS Statistics automatically shuts down,
prompting you to save changes first.
Working with Multiple Data Sets in Command Syntax.
If you use Command Syntax to open data sources, for example, get file, get data,
you need to use the Data Set Name command to name each data set explicitly in order to have
more than one data source open at the same time.
When working with Command Syntax, the active data set name is displayed on the toolbar of
the Syntax window.
All of the following actions can change the active data set.
Use the Data Set Activate command.
Click anywhere in the Data Editor window of a data set.
Select a data set name from the toolbar in the Syntax window.
Copying and pasting information between data sets.
You can copy both data and variable definition attributes from one data set to another data set
in basically the same way that you copy and paste information within a single data file.
Copying and pasting selected data cells in Data View pastes only the data values with no variable
definition attributes.
Copying and pasting an entire variable in Data View by selecting the variable name at the top
of the column pastes all of the data and all of the variable definition attributes for
that variable.
Copying and pasting variable definition attributes or entire variables in Variable View pastes the
selected attributes or the entire variable definition, but does not paste any data values.
Renaming Data Sets.
When you open a data source through the menus and dialog boxes, each data source is automatically
assigned a data set name of data set N, where N is a sequential integer value, and when you
open a data source using command syntax, no data set name is assigned unless you explicitly
specify one with data set name.
To provide more descriptive data set names, E.
From the menus in the Data Editor window for the data set whose name you want to change, choose
File, Rename Data Set.
E.
Enter a new data set name that conforms to variable naming rules.
Suppressing Multiple Data Sets If you prefer to have only one data set
available at a time and want to suppress the Multiple Data Set feature, E.
From the menus, choose Edit, Options.
E.
Click the General tab.
Select, Check, Open only one data set at a time.
