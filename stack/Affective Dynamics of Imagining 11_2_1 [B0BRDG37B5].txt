this is the active podcast where we provide short clips from the active inference institute weekly
live streams if you want to take a deeper dive into this material check out the entire live
stream at the active inference institute youtube channel the link to the live stream is provided
in the episode description i am blue knight the host and curator of this episode which is clipped
from live stream number 11.2 this discussion is based on the 2020 paper entitled sophisticated
active inference simulating anticipatory affective dynamics of imagining future events by casper
hest alex shantz baron millage maxwell ramstead carl friston and ryan smith this discussion will
be facilitated by daniel friedman who's going to start us off with a question about active
inference how can we learn and communicate the technical aspects of active inference in an
accessible fashion stephen go ahead thank you hi i'm stephen i'm based in toronto i do a lot of work
with participatory theater and community development i don't know if i'm going to explain how to do
this but i'll explain a challenge which um i think it's important to overcome it because it's so
valuable is i was just in a conversation and trying to talk about systems and how we can how we think
about systems when we engage um in communities and think about how we understand the world there's a lot
of stuff in in the world of kind of the social arts and participatory theater where it's like
we need to do something with the system and then it flips to we're all a living system it's the body
knows and we just know how it is we just need to listen to the body and it will know and um it's both
you know it's we're in this dynamic niche of which there's an awful lot of stuff we don't know
yet we can tap into our body and the way that our body works and there's a way that we construct
meaning the world so i suppose trying to find a way to take case studies and show how it can help
will be really useful thank you sasha hi my name is sasha stephen i really um i agree with what you
said and uh ironically or i guess in a very meta way um active inference is the answer to that question
because um through like closing the loop and introducing action into the system we can better
understand thinking about the system and so i think that's a really great point that um case studies
and uh really specific applications of active inference are going to be the best way to teach
and learn about it um so yeah i think that's a great point cool blue uh when we think about
modeling in active inference it's interesting to think about scaling this not in the way that we
talked about when we were talking about scaling active inference but in the way that like we have
several different systems even just existing within the body right like the input and output of the
stomach and the spleen and the liver and and you know also like the brain and the the somatic awareness
right to speak to kind of what what steven was saying earlier so it's interesting to try to think
about modeling systems within systems in in active inference yep and actually this brain and body
uh dialogue and the multi-systems approach in the way that it doesn't say well everyone told you the
brain was important actually it's the body no it's actually it's both and similarly it's like
quantitative and qualitative and so it's not just that we're going to throw out one for the other
but we want to think across that division and integrate them that's the beyond internalism
and externalism and integrating the sciences with the humanities and other things that we're
kind of talking about scott hi i'm scott david i'm at the university of washington applied physics lab
there was an article that came out on december 4th in science magazine called the exploitative
segregation of plant roots what it was talking about is the way that plant roots grow specifically you
have two trees next to each other each has a system each has a markov blanket they're growing next to
each other and they differentiate their plant growth roots to optimize statistically their nutrient uptake
and so they don't go and intrude on other plants roots space because that would not be optimized for
them because they'd be putting more resources into growing further roots and and but getting fewer
nutrients because they'd be nearer the other plant and so to me i looked at that and i went wow that's
a real nice way to understand the dynamics of two different organisms interacting with statistical
gradients there it's a nutritional gradient specifically that felt to me like it was a nice way to kind of
introduce that idea of the of the contact between the two different systems cool so what i'm going to take
from this second question and all the answers to it is that through examples that are accessible and
at hand we can all start to learn more about the relational side of active inference and also the
statistical and the quantitative because both those sides are going to be learning journeys for everybody
because no one's going to know all the statistics no one's going to know all the deep relational pieces
that are so uh familiar to performance artists and other areas so one thing i'm wondering about is how
do we think about emotion or this parameter in systems that aren't us and i'm also even wondering
whether the emotions we experience are these parameters and how do we name parameters or talk about
parameters of mathematical models in a way such that they're recognizable and capture meaning but also
don't constrain or sort of uh falsely limit what it means to be that term so we can get into a map
territory issue when we're talking about computational models of emotion just like we could with
consciousness blue as i'm starting to study more about emotion like i'm a logic and science kind of
researcher and so but learning about emotion just reading personally a lot of it seems to be like
non-verbal right and so how do you like quantify or even measure emotion on a scale when it's it's
really like you know you're feeling some you know primitive thing from you know when you were left in
your crib as a child that you have no words for because you didn't have words for it at that time and
so how do you kind of like like impart some kind of meaning or quantitative scale on something that that
maybe there's not even language for yes it's almost like the uh discredited but guiding three-part brain
model so it's like the most prefrontal is the numbers in that level of formalization and then
a little bit lower we have language but then below that the substrate is actually experience and that's
the embodied experience that may or may not even have words to express it and then we can look at
expressions like poetry or speech and is there a way to get more precise or is it merely an expression
that's arising from an emotional state but the emotional state isn't a number it's not a words
it's actually something that's more deep scott i was wondering if with regard to dance and performance
whether there are ways of communicating because we talk about embodied i wonder about encoding so can
emotions be encoded in dance in a way that they can't be encoded in speech or other movement so that
it becomes a surrogate or kind of that mirror neuron idea that you're projecting out an emotion by the
projection of your body position the morphology uh being the encoding of the emotion cool question
yeah stephen definitely yeah i think this also relates to this question of um affect and dimensionality
so maybe there's a way that when we take a perspective on things we kind of look at a
dimensional approach but it can be encoded in some sort of spatial um affective way and maybe those
dimensions aren't they they become like dimensions but the encoding is is not as linear as that a bit
like color space when we see colors the the space of colors you can encode it in sort of in in lightness
and two different types of color dimensions but the way that it's encoded is it when people look at
perception it's not it's not linear in that space so maybe there's like an affect space which somehow
encodes in a in a way which is non-dimensional so might um aesthetics be um provisional um efforts at
encoding very nice to bring in the aesthetics and the intuition because intuition is that which can't
be expressed it's sort of like the dark matter it's the submerged part of the iceberg but those reflect
the deepest priors potentially that help us search through the state space that as we've been
exploring is vast to do the exponential rollout of a chess game is going to be hard it's going to be
more um basically states than you can keep track of however if you think i feel good about this uh
arrangement of the pieces then with just a simple affect and a limited rollout you may be able to do
very well we hope you enjoyed this week's episode stay tuned for next time when we're going to have
more discussions of the same paper
