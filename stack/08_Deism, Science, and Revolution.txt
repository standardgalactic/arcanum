If America had an intellectual capital before 1740, then it would have to have been Boston.
The two major printers of books in the British colonies in the late 1600s,
Samuel Green of Cambridge and John Foster, were both headquartered in Boston or its environs.
And Boston led the way in the number of active booksellers, with as many as 15 by 1740.
Having Harvard College as a near neighbor also guaranteed a certain critical intellectual mass to the Boston area.
But Boston was also home to an equally critical artistic mass.
As Boston's merchants prospered from the trade that drove the clergy into paroxysms of anxiety about worldliness,
they celebrated their successes by commissioning portraits of themselves.
And by the mid-1700s, Boston had developed, well, if not exactly a school of portraiture,
then at least a self-conscious concentration of highly talented portrait artists.
John Smeibert, Robert Fake, John Greenwood, Joseph Badger,
and the finest painter colonial America would ever produce, John Singleton Copley.
Yet, all of these achievements, all of these accomplishments,
somehow added up to less than the sum of their Bostonian parts.
Copley was exasperated that his talents had to be chained to turning out likenesses of businessmen and merchants.
And he yearned for the opportunity to turn his self-taught hand to classical history painting.
Was it not for the preserving the resemblance of particular persons,
painting would not be known in this place, Copley complained.
The people generally regard it no more than any other useful trade, as they sometimes term it,
like that of a carpenter, tailor, or shoemaker,
not as one of the most noble arts in the world,
which is not a little mortifying to me.
When the political winds of the revolution began to blow in directions that Copley found incongenial,
he left for New York, and then in 1774 for London, never to return to America.
Whatever intellectual dominance Boston enjoyed before 1740 came to it mainly by default rather than design.
The prize after 1740 for being an intellectual capital increasingly belonged not to Boston,
but to Philadelphia.
Founded in 1682 as the capital of William Penn's gargantuan but oddball feudal land grant of Pennsylvania
from King Charles II, Philadelphia enjoyed nothing like a promising beginning
as an intellectual capital for America.
The Quakers, William Penn's religious society of friends, as they preferred to call themselves,
were the last and the most radical of the radical sects spawned by English Puritanism in the 17th century.
Where the Puritans had questioned the authority of bishops,
the Quakers questioned the authority of any clergy.
Where the Puritans refused to accept anything but the text of scripture as their religious authority,
the Quakers refused to accept even that as too carnal and worldly.
And they looked to their own religious consciousness for the testimony of a light within.
And where the Puritans dealt out moral discipline with the understanding that depravity was too deeply rooted
in the human heart for any discipline to expect to succeed entirely.
Now, the Quakers meted out discipline with the severity of those who fully expected
that they could and should obtain perfection for themselves and for their neighbors.
These were not people with much use for theological, philosophical, or classical learning.
Penn's goal for his colony and for his city was a social uniformity that made Boston look like Las Vegas.
Untrustworthy of the dark crevices of cities, Penn laid out Philadelphia as a city with broad streets,
meeting at neat right angles, so that vice and misery might have no place to hide
from the inspection of those perfected by the light within.
And he expected the countryside around Pennsylvania would be laid out for farmers and settlers
in neat, contiguous townships, with Quaker meeting houses located serenely in the center
to give order and happiness to Quaker life.
For, as Penn put it,
the more convenient bringing up of youth so that neighbors may help one another
and that they may accustom their children also to do the same.
Well, there are no optimists more surely destined for disappointment
than those who believe in human perfectibility.
And William Penn became an object lesson in that sort of disappointment.
As I said in an earlier lecture, Penn's fellow Quakers showed little disposition to join him
in creating a Quaker paradise in Pennsylvania.
They never numbered more than a fraction of the total population.
And Penn could only sell land in Pennsylvania and make a profit from it
by having to offer it to a wide and dismaying variety of non-Quakers,
even non-English, who rapidly turned Pennsylvania into a melange
of European nationalities, religions, and languages, especially religions.
Pennsylvania became the stopping point for Mennonites from the Frawian River Valley
in Switzerland, Dunkers and Schwenkfelders from the German principalities,
German Lutherans, German Calvinists, Scots-Irish Presbyterians, English Baptists,
and Church of England, Roman Catholic, and at least 30% of categories
that could only be described as other.
Some of these immigrants were fully as radical and fully as suspicious
of any learning that seemed to dampen the impulses of the spirit as the Quakers.
But the Presbyterians, the Lutherans, the German Calvinists,
and the Church of England people, and that amounted to nearly half
of Pennsylvania's population by the time of the Revolution,
they came from traditions with long intellectual allegiances
and a strong penchant for establishing schools to reinforce those allegiances.
When the pro-Whitefield Presbyterians split from the anti-revivalist Presbyterians
during the Great Awakening, they had to find new ways of training pro-revival clergy.
And so they ended up founding four separate theological academies,
starting with the Log College in the Chamonix, which I mentioned in Lecture 5.
And instead of turning into finishing schools for ranters,
all of these academies quickly settled down to promoting learned languages,
liberal arts, sciences, and divinity.
The Moravians, the Baptists, even the Quakers,
all organized religious schools to nurture their offspring between 1720 and 1740.
And anti-revivalist Church of England people were the leading hand behind the creation
of the Academy of Philadelphia in 1751,
which, as I said earlier, becomes the College of Philadelphia
and then the University of Pennsylvania.
By 1773, even the Lutherans in Pennsylvania had organized a German seminary.
Certainly, one factor which made this proliferation of schools possible
was Philadelphia's rise to commercial power in the British colonies.
From a population of 13,000 in 1740,
Philadelphia grew to 40,000 in 1776.
And its seaborne commerce down the Delaware Bay dominated the colonial coastal trade,
dwarfing even that of New England.
Well, luxury, as Yosef Pieper once demonstrated,
is the basis of civilization.
And Philadelphia's wealth,
combined with the need that its competing factions felt for self-justification and self-promotion,
certainly provided a wide variety of forums for a good deal of self-justification and self-promotion,
including 120 licensed taverns,
the American Philosophical Society,
the College of Physicians,
and the Library Company of Philadelphia.
But Philadelphia's richest intellectual assets lay in the remarkable cluster of Enlightenment thinkers
who came together there between 1740 and 1790
to make Philadelphia not just America's preeminent intellectual city,
but the Enlightenment's preeminent outpost in America.
And among those thinkers,
none enjoyed greater standing at home or abroad than Benjamin Franklin.
Benjamin Franklin was actually born in Boston on January 17, 1706,
little more than two years younger than Jonathan Edwards.
That may have been the only point on which he was close to Edwards.
The youngest son among his father's 17 children,
Franklin was quick enough, mentally,
that Josiah Franklin paid to have the boy put to the grammar school at eight years of age
with a view towards devoting young Benjamin as the tithe of his sons to the service of the church.
But given that Josiah Franklin was a soap maker and a man of narrow means,
that lasted for only a year.
And in 1718, young Benjamin was apprenticed instead to his older brother James, a printer.
Printers occupied an unusual place in the intellectual pecking order of early America.
If the clergy were the aristocrats of the mind,
printers were its maids of all work.
Since printers lived by publishing an entrepreneurial assortment of newspapers,
almanacs, and books,
they were not supported by a salary paid from compulsory taxes the way the clergy were.
They had to sell their own wares.
And in order to make a profit from that,
they had to be well-read themselves,
so that they could pick up from European booksellers
things likely to sell in America,
or publish works which they were confident would sell in their own shops,
or skim from European periodicals,
stories, and items that would make their news sheets popular.
Pritters were a unique class.
They had one foot in the world of tradesmen who worked with their hands,
and the other foot in the literate world of transatlantic books and periodicals.
They lived by their networks of commercial and intellectual connections.
And they nurtured a studied contempt for the soft-handed professionals
whose patrons or whose incomes allowed them to write without also having to work.
The insiders' view of the world of the printers inclined them to skepticism,
even while they made handsome profits from selling religious books.
Into this world, Benjamin Franklin fit like a hand to a glove.
While working for his brother,
he perpetrated the first of his many literary hoaxes
by submitting a series of pseudonymous letters
through the mail to his brother's shop,
lampooning Cotton Mather in particular and Harvard College in general.
James Franklin unwittingly published these letters,
and then, when he discovered that it was his brother who had actually written them,
took out his embarrassment on young Benjamin,
and in due course, young Benjamin skipped town
and arrived on October 6th, 1723, in Philadelphia.
Franklin set up his own printing shop,
and by the 1730s, he had begun issuing a highly popular newspaper,
the Pennsylvania Gazette.
He won very profitable printing contracts from the Pennsylvania Assembly.
He invested in a series of franchise print shops
in Annapolis, Williamsburg, Savannah, Newcastle, New London, Charleston, and Boston.
He issued a hilariously successful annual almanac,
Poor Richard's Almanac,
and he even wangled the unofficial designation as George Whitefield's printer of choice,
thereby earning a fortune from the sales of Whitefield's journals and Whitefield's other books.
At age 42, Benjamin Franklin was wealthy enough to commission Robert Fake to paint his portrait,
and to turn over the printing business to a partner so that he, Franklin,
could devote himself to the philosophical interests,
which had increasingly come to dominate his attention.
Benjamin Franklin always nursed something of the bitterness that dogs people,
who are aware of their intellectual talents,
but who have been barred by circumstances from cultivating them
in the usual approved fashion of college or polite society.
The wealth he had earned in printing now gave him that chance,
and he was determined to show how much better he could manage on his own.
He taught himself languages.
He won appointment to political office.
He founded the club, which became the American Philosophical Society,
and the lending library, which became the library company,
and the school, which became the Academy of Philadelphia.
He tried, again, by way of self-promotion, social climbing,
he tried attending the city's Presbyterian church
as the closest thing to the congregationalism in which he had been raised in Boston.
But he had no time for the polemic arguments of the minister, Jedediah Andrews.
What Franklin really wanted to hear was about moral principle.
And so, not hearing that from Jedediah Andrews,
Franklin stayed at home and devised his own version of rational Enlightenment religion.
But what gained Franklin the international notice he really craved
were his experiments in electricity.
Electricity was, so to speak, the mystery force of the Enlightenment.
Isaac Newton defined the motion of the universe
as the action not of occult qualities within substances
or of divine decrees whizzing the planets around.
Rather, he defined motion in the universe
as being propelled by a force, gravity.
A force which was impersonal
and which was capable of being computed mathematically.
Electricity was a good candidate for a second such force.
Especially after Newton's disciple, Francis Hawksby,
was able to generate electrical bursts
by rubbing glass globes and tubes.
Unlike gravity,
generating electricity by means of a friction machine,
by glass globes and by connecting rods,
all of this, unlike gravity,
made for fabulously entertaining parlor games.
Especially when members of an audience could be prevailed upon
to allow a spark to jump from the globe to their fingers
and electrify them.
Well, Franklin was captivated by electricity
from the first time he'd seen one of these demonstrations in 1746.
But his interests pointed beyond entertainment
to real science.
And in 1747, Franklin sent a series of letters
to the Royal Society in London
demonstrating that lightning
was in fact a form of electricity.
In other words, lightning was a gigantic version of the parlor trick.
This was actually a pretty serious assertion.
Because lightning was regarded,
in this still overwhelmingly agricultural society,
as a mysterious and capricious force at best.
And maybe even a sign of intentional divine wrath at worst.
Redefining lightning as electricity
instantly downgraded it to the level of a natural force
and made it potentially as manipulable as gravity.
Or at least, no more occult than gravity.
Partly, this satisfied Franklin's skeptical religious reflexes.
Partly, it gave him the satisfaction
Benjamin Franklin, born a poor boy in Boston,
a printer who had worked with his hands in Philadelphia
and made his own fortune.
It gave him the satisfaction
of having tumbled to a scientific insight
almost as significant as Newton's about gravity.
But the Royal Society ignored his letters
and his pretensions to gentlemanly science.
And Franklin was forced to work around the Royal Society
in order to get recognition
by publishing Experiments and Observations on Electricity
made at Philadelphia by Mr. Benjamin Franklin
in April of 1751.
The book eventually went through five editions
and translations into Italian, French, and German.
And nothing, said Joseph Priestley,
was ever written upon the subject of electricity
which was more generally read and admired
in all parts of Europe than these letters.
Almost as an afterthought,
in 1752, Franklin published an account
of a further experiment with lightning and electricity,
flying a kite with a key in a thunderstorm
to demonstrate that lightning can be drawn down naturally
like any other form of electricity.
There is no evidence that Franklin
actually attempted this experiment himself.
And with good reason,
because anyone who reflects for a moment
on such an experiment,
with a kite, a metal key,
in the middle of a thunderstorm,
will realize that this is really
a very direct way of getting oneself killed.
In fact,
the famous kite and key experiment
may have merely been Franklin's way
of cocking a snook at the Royal Society
by suggesting a very effective means
by which they could all
electrocute themselves.
Well, Franklin was not the only Philadelphian
who found the city's new wealth
opening the way to a love of science
by its virtuosi or ingenious men.
He was not, in fact,
even the most influential
of Philadelphia's virtuosi,
largely because after 1757,
Franklin spent most of the next 20 years
in England and Europe,
acting as agent and representative
for Pennsylvania and other colonies in London.
The real center of Philadelphia's enlightenment
would be the American Philosophical Society,
modeled on a private club
Franklin had once organized,
the Junto,
and now revivified
as a colonial scientific society.
Twice a month,
between October and May,
and once a month during the summer,
members of the American Philosophical Society,
who totaled 251 by 1769,
met at the Pennsylvania State House
in Philadelphia
to hear scientific papers read,
participate in discussions
of scientific subjects,
and to look over new books
received for the society's library.
First among equals
in the American Philosophical Society
was Ebenezer Kinnersley,
a one-time Baptist minister
who criticized the awakening
and its preaching of terror
in favor of a religion of reason,
and who became Franklin's chief apprentice
as a scientific
and electrical experimenter.
Francis Allison,
to take another case,
was an anti-revivalist
Presbyterian minister
who made stand
against enthusiasm
and wild disorders
that were like to destroy religion
and even ruin our churches.
Allison presided
as vice provost
over the Academy of Philadelphia.
Beside Allison
as a Presbyterian
was John Ewing,
who followed
Jedediah Andrews
as pastor
of Philadelphia's
Presbyterian congregation,
and who directed
the study of natural philosophy
at the Academy
in, quite properly,
Newtonian terms.
Two prominent physicians
also stood out
from the membership
of the APS,
William Shippen
and Benjamin Rush,
both of whom
were trained
in that very epicenter
of the Scottish Enlightenment,
the University of Edinburgh.
But the most
omni-talented
of all the Philadelphians
was the shy
mathematician
and instrument maker
David Rittenhouse,
who joined the APS
in 1768
and who was
theorist enough
to encounter
the problem
of determining
from a few observations
the orbit
of a comet
and also
mechanic enough
to make
with his own hands
an equal altitude
instrument,
a transit telescope,
and a timepiece.
There was a man
after Benjamin Franklin's
own heart.
When the APS
joined
in the single
greatest
scientific experiment
of the Enlightenment,
the worldwide
sighting
of the Sun's
transit
of Venus
in 1769,
it was Rittenhouse,
who was commissioned
to build
the astronomical
clock
necessary
to time
the transit.
It's been easy
to mistake
Kinnersley
and the others
as mere extensions
of Franklin's
interests,
or to assume
that like
Rittenhouse,
they were all
dedicated to the
enterprise of reducing
the universe
to mere clockwork.
But in fact,
there was a serious
parting of the ways
between Franklin
and the rest
of the Philadelphia
Enlightenment,
and that parting
of the ways
occurred principally
on the subject
of religion.
Benjamin Franklin
was,
at best,
a deist.
Deism
was the Enlightenment's
shorthand
for describing
someone who had
rejected
traditional Christianity
as irrational,
but who retained
belief in some
sort of deity
who could be defined
in reasonable terms
and who did not
interfere with the
operation of Isaac
Newton's laws.
Franklin himself
defined his own
deism
in terms of
five highly
minimalistic
principles.
That there is
one God
who made all things,
that he governs
the world
by his providence,
that he ought
to be worshipped
by adoration,
prayer,
and thanksgiving,
but that the most
acceptable service
of God
is doing good
to man,
that the soul
is immortal,
and that God
will certainly
reward virtue
and punish vice
either here
or hereafter.
The Philadelphia
Enlightenment,
however,
had a much more
expansive view
of religion
than Benjamin Franklin.
For Ebenezer
Kinnersley,
the purpose
of science
was to dispel
superstition,
but also
to open the path
to an accurate
appreciation
of God's glory.
The botanist,
William Bartram,
was too eccentric,
a religious thinker,
for even the Quakers
to handle.
But Bartram
looked in botany
for the workings
of a God
who penetrates
and animates
the universe
through a secret
divine influence.
And that was
asking for a great
deal more
than Benjamin Franklin's
deism.
Francis Allison
taught that
God actively
directed the nature,
powers,
orders,
changes,
and connections
of all things
and would never
allow the universe
to spiral down
into the vortex
of what Allison
called blind chance,
which, in fact,
sounds a good deal
more like what
Benjamin Franklin
was recommending.
Like the Scottish
Enlightenment,
which it so much
resembled,
Philadelphia's
Enlightenment
was poised,
balanced,
between nature,
the principle
of the Enlightenment,
and grace.
Natural law
was held
and understood
to explain
a great deal,
but it did not
explain everything.
Just as,
by the same token,
the Bible,
as God's revelation
of his purposes,
explained a great deal,
but not with
absolute certainty.
Divine revelation
and religious intuition
formed the first
principles of human
knowledge,
but a second step
into scientific
experiment
and scientific
investigation
was needed
to confirm
and expand
upon that grace.
So the Philadelphia
Enlightenment
embraced a mix
of faith
and skepticism,
of nature
and grace,
and once again
offers us
the image
of Puritanism
and the Enlightenment
stirring the intellectual
pot together.
Philadelphia
might have had
a better chance
of making
Philadelphia's
Enlightenment
into America's
philosophy
had it not been
for the battering
Philadelphia received
during the Revolution.
Occupied by the British
in 1777
and then trampled
over by radical
revolutionary mobs
in the 1780s,
many of the institutions
and individuals
on which Philadelphia's
Enlightenment
had rested
either disappeared
or reappeared,
sadly diminished.
Benjamin Franklin
returned to Philadelphia
in 1775,
but only to be sent
abroad a year later
to France
to broker the treaty
that brought the French
to Revolutionary
America's aid.
He did not return
for a decade
and he died
in 1790.
Rittenhouse
died in 1796,
having been passed
over by the APS
for the delivery
of Franklin's eulogy.
There was a real slap
in the face.
Benjamin Rush
died in 1813
after furiously
trying to persuade
Philadelphians
that their recurrent
yellow fever epidemics
were best cured
by purging
and bleeding.
Somehow they never
made the connection
with those clouds
of mosquitoes.
The APS itself
met only intermittently
during the
revolutionary crisis
and they stopped
meeting altogether
after 1776
for the duration
of the war.
The Academy of Philadelphia
was shut down
by the revolutionaries
and a university
operated by the
Pennsylvania legislature
was erected in its place.
Not until 1790
was the Academy
of Philadelphia
and its state rival
united to create
a new University
of Pennsylvania.
And Philadelphia,
which had functioned
as the political center
of America
as its revolutionary capital
and then as its capital
under the new Constitution
from 1790 to 1800,
Philadelphia lost
that title
and lost
that central
political position
in American affairs
to the new
federal district
of Columbia.
By 1800,
Philadelphia's
Enlightenment,
if not exactly over,
was certainly
moribund.
The task
of making the
spirits of
Puritanism
and the Enlightenment
work together
would now fall
to other hands.
