The Enlightenment in Europe and in America sprawled across many questions, but at the
end of the day, its fundamental question was about epistemology, about how we know things.
For instance, when we have an idea in our minds, what causes it?
If we have an idea of a chair, what's the relationship between the idea of the chair that we have and
the chair itself?
Does the chair cause the idea to be formed in our minds?
If we press that question, it pretty strongly implies that our minds are passive and simply
wait for things like chairs to cause them.
If so, is the physical process which communicates information about the chair, in other words,
our five senses, is that physical process reliable?
Or take another tack.
When we have an idea, is that idea presented to a mind, which is to say a spiritual, non-material
consciousness that you could call a soul, that can deliberate and exercise free will about
how to respond to that idea?
Or is it received simply by a brain, which is to say an electrically charged assembly of
gray matter that responds, like Pavlov's dogs, to certain kinds of stimulation?
And in that case, free will is an illusion, and the notion that we are inhabited by a conscious
soul, well, that's just another religious deception.
The Enlightenment invented three basic responses to this question of how we know things.
The first of which was, quite simply, materialism.
In other words, human beings are composed entirely of material substance.
In fact, the universe itself is composed only of material substance.
And those substances obey the same scientific laws that all other substances obey.
Minds, therefore, are only brains.
And ideas are only responses to stimuli.
Likewise, freedom of will, a charming illusion.
And religion, little more than a human device for coping with fear and curiosity.
Humanity, as Julien de la MÃ©trie starkly put it in 1748, is just a machine.
This position first was staked out in the English-speaking world by Thomas Hobbes,
the skeptical and atheistic political philosopher.
But its most successful popularization came in John Locke's essay concerning human understanding
in 1690.
Like Hobbes, Locke located the source of human ideas in physical sensation.
And although his analysis of the mind's operations was a lot more sophisticated than Hobbes's,
the basic result was the same.
Human thought was a process explainable as the result of physical sensation.
According to Locke, ideas were not spiritual entities or beings prepackaged within our minds at birth
or communicated by God through divine illumination.
Ideas are nothing more than the object of the mind's attention at any given moment.
Locke was careful to deny that this made him an atheist like Hobbes,
but he was repeatedly accused of being Hobbes's Trojan horse.
This materialism, however, provoked an equal but opposite reaction.
And that reaction was contained in the immaterialism of Bishop George Barclay.
Barclay attacked Locke's analysis of ideas by pointing out that Locke had unwittingly painted himself
into a corner on this one critical point.
How did the mind actually know that the information it was receiving from the senses was reliable?
Locke had to admit that our ideas can only represent objects.
The objects themselves only make impressions on the senses.
And the senses convey impulses to the mind,
where an idea of the object is assembled.
But the mind never really comes into direct contact with the objects themselves.
Our sensations are all that our minds ever have direct contact with.
And knowledge is really only accumulated from the representations made by the senses.
So, Locke was a realist.
In other words, knowledge is based on our sensations of real objects,
which have real existence outside our thoughts.
But he was a representational realist.
Because the mind never gets into actual contact with those objects.
Only with their representations in the form of ideas.
But, Bishop Barclay observed on that basis,
we have no guarantee whatsoever that our ideas represent anything.
Or that they arise from sensation of objects outside of our consciousness.
If we have no knowledge of anything except our ideas,
and Barclay wanted to know if anyone had ever thought of anything which was not an idea,
then we have no way to get around those ideas and start talking about a world that exists beyond our ideas.
But that, in turn, only raised the question as to where our ideas actually come from.
Because ideas do not possess wills of their own with which to cause their own existence.
They're not like pop-ups on a computer screen.
Barclay's answer was the utter antithesis of Locke and Hobbes.
Because God causes all of our ideas.
So that everything which we know is, in fact, a creation of God directly in our minds.
The real source of our ideas is not in objects, but in the perception of objects.
And the only objects of perception are ideas formed in our minds by God.
Now, this made for great philosophical fun.
But the fact was that Barclay's immaterialism was almost as unacceptable to the majority of European thinkers
as an explanation of how we know things, as Hobbes' atheism.
And immaterialism never amounted to more than a minority report in the Enlightenment.
The majority report was, as usual, left to a compromise position.
And this is why the Cartesian method won so many converts.
Descartes could doubt the existence of everything except the operations of his own mind.
But since the mind was capable of discovering and proving its own existence,
that showed that the mind had an existence independent of matter.
So, spiritual substances, minds, and material substances, bodies, objects, could coexist in the universe.
But the best illustration of this coexistence was Isaac Newton's theory of gravity.
Because gravity was nothing, if not the ideal way of showing how spirit, in this case God,
could operate upon matter without needing to directly move or alter it beyond the laws of physics.
Just as the planets moved effortlessly through empty space in their unsupported orbits,
so the entire universe could function just as effortlessly, without mechanism,
directed from a discrete distance by the power of God.
Both Descartes and Newton opened up a way to have the new philosophy and still have God.
But it was clear that the God who emerged from their debates was no longer the God of the Bible
or the God of the Reformation,
but a God defined by what the natural order would allow them to say about spiritual substance.
This may have satisfied Descartes and Newton,
but not the broad spectrum of European opinion in the Enlightenment.
Which is why, in the midst of this Enlightenment,
there occurs a remarkably and utterly unprecedented reawakening
of the most intense and aggressive forms of evangelical Christianity.
It came in a bewildering variety of those forms.
In Protestant Germany, it appeared in the form of what became known as pietism.
In France, it took on the form of Jansenism.
In England, it appeared in both the writings and the lives of the non-jurors
and in the Methodist revivals of John Wesley.
But in all of them,
the most intense and passionate Christian piety was reawakened across Europe,
and in numbers and in force which made the Enlightenment look shallow and inconsequential.
Even though nothing could be more certain than the spiritual and intellectual gulf
which separates these awakenings from the spirit of the Enlightenment,
it's important to see that the Enlightenment and the awakenings
shared some important common ground.
There was, as it turned out, more than one way to have a revolution against Aristotle.
In general, the awakenings shared with the Enlightenment
a common sense of weariness and skepticism
about the usefulness and virtue of the established churches in Europe,
Protestant and Roman Catholic alike.
They also shared the impulse to find a more authentic and natural kind of experience.
The Enlightenment wanted to abandon Christianity almost entirely
and uncover a more basic and authentic religion of nature.
The awakeners did not want to abandon Christianity,
but they sought to recover a more basic and authentic religion as well.
Not the religion of nature, but the religion of the heart.
The true piety of primitive, basic Christianity.
And these awakeners will read the new science,
but use it to prove the impotence and limitations of the human reason
before a universal system so vast and so incomprehensible.
And it is at this point in the history of the American mind
that the name of Jonathan Edwards springs almost automatically to the lips.
Jonathan Edwards was born on October 5th, 1703.
The son of Timothy Edwards,
the pastor of the Congregationalist Parish of East Windsor, Connecticut,
and of Esther Stoddard Edwards,
whose father, Solomon Stoddard,
was the pastor of the Church of Northampton, Massachusetts,
and the most powerful ecclesiastical figure in western New England.
From both sides of his family,
Jonathan Edwards inherited a distrust
of what was going on in Boston and at Harvard.
Stoddard, his grandfather, had decided as early as the 1660s
that restricting church membership
only to those who could make a public confession
of receiving God's grace
was a recipe for marginalizing the Church's impact in society.
Only a few in Northampton, Massachusetts,
would ever come forward with a claim so staggering,
Stoddard argued.
The rest would drift off to the sidelines of the Church,
where an opportunity to experience that grace might never happen.
So Stoddard not only threw down the barriers
the first generation of New England Puritans had put in place,
but threw even the halfway covenant,
which had been invented as a partial membership system
to the winds and invited every member of the town
to baptism and communion.
As for Harvard,
the churches and the settlements of the Connecticut River Valley
had long nursed suspicions
about the weak theological knees
that governed intellectual affairs in Cambridge,
and that is why Connecticut Puritans
finally decided on founding their own college in 1701
to be what Harvard had once been.
And so the young Edwards,
just shy of his 13th birthday,
was sent to Yale,
even though the infant college
had not yet even worked out a permanent location.
It finally settled at New Haven.
His education rested
on the English and Dutch Protestant scholastics.
William Ames,
Francis Burgestyke,
Adrian Haribord,
many of the figures whom we met in Lecture 2.
But whether anyone was particularly noticing it or not,
Yale's rector,
Timothy Cutler,
he who would,
as we saw last time,
shortly defect to the Church of England,
Cutler also assigned William Brattle's
Cartesian New Logic to the students,
as well as the study of Mr. Locke
and Sir Isaac Newton.
Edwards applied himself
to these innovations in the curriculum
reluctantly,
not because he lacked a taste for philosophy,
but because he greatly preferred
the old logic.
Yet, that did not prevent him
from rising to the top of his class intellectually.
And when he graduated from Yale,
the choice for giving the valedictory oration
fell to Edwards.
Despite his loyalties to the old logic,
Edwards could not keep his curiosity
from wandering to the new philosophy.
By the time he graduated,
he had begun dabbling in two scientific essays,
on insects and on spiders.
And he began keeping commonplace books
with his own speculations on epistemology
and natural science.
Once out of Yale,
he briefly served as pastor
to a small congregation in New York City.
But in June 1724,
he accepted an invitation from Yale,
which was still reeling from the great apostasy of Cutler,
to return as a tutor.
He spent the next three years
working out more deeply
his explorations into epistemology,
pursuing a clearer and more immediate view
of God's exerting himself
with respect to spirits and mind,
as I have of his operations
concerning matter and bodies.
And rather than embracing
an outright Lockean naturalism,
that all substance was material,
or a synthetic dualism,
that material and spiritual substances coexisted,
Edwards was gradually pulled
to an immaterialism
similar to that of Bishop Barclay,
in which that which is truly
the substance of all bodies
is the infinitely exact
and precise
and perfectly stable idea
in God's mind.
There was, however,
little professional future
for junior tutors at Yale.
And in November of 1726,
the Northampton Church
called Edwards
to become his grandfather
Stoddard's assistant pastor.
Edwards was ordained
by the Northampton Church
in February of 1727.
And in 1729,
after his grandfather
Stoddard's death,
Edwards succeeded him
as pastor of the town.
To the great annoyance
of the enormous web
of Edwards' Stoddard relations,
the Hawleys,
the Williamses,
who all had sons of their own
ready for the ministry.
The notations
in his philosophical notebooks
trailed off
as the demands
of a busy pastorate
washed over him.
But from time to time,
they surfaced again
in Edwards' sermons,
where it became clear
that for Edwards,
immaterialism
had become an effective weapon
for the defense
of traditional Calvinism.
Calvinism.
Invited in 1731
to deliver
the Boston public lecture,
Edwards warned
against the tendency
of man
to exalt himself
and depend
on his own power
or goodness,
which was, of course,
good Calvinistic theology.
The reasoning behind this
smacked strongly
of new philosophical
immaterialism.
immaterialism.
God acts
in immaterialist fashion
as
an extrinsic
occasional agent
on the mind.
Whatever ideas
we have
are the product,
not of sensation,
nor of the mind
as a machine,
but of the direct
action
of God.
And echoing
the European awakeners,
Edwards was careful
not to make
this action
simply a matter
of God
presenting ideas
directly to the mind
and leaving the mind
to do with them
what it pleased.
God's action
works
not
upon the reason
or
ratiocination,
but upon
a sense
of the heart
which
immediately
perceives
a beauty,
a divine
and transcendent
and most evidently
distinguishing
glory
in God.
Edwards
thus made
immaterialist
philosophy,
serve the interests
of Calvinist
piety.
The promotion
of piety
became Edwards'
particular burden
in the 1730s,
especially when
in 1734
a very
remarkable
blessing
of heaven
fell on
Northampton.
In the Puritan
past,
the experience
of religious
conversion
had been
largely a matter
of individual
spiritual renewal
under the careful
direction
of pastors
and family
elders.
The novelty
introduced
by the awakeners
of the 18th century
was to turn
the experience
of grace
into a communal
experience,
a group revival
of religion
that could
involve
whole towns,
sometimes entire
regions.
Solomon Stoddard,
with his eye
always on the
improvement of his
parish,
had welcomed
several small
revivals like this
in Northampton
during his long
pastorate there.
And so had
Edwards' father,
Timothy Edwards,
in their home
parish in East
Windsor.
But this revival,
which continued
into 1735,
saw,
as Edwards
described it,
more than
300 souls
savingly brought
home to Christ
in this town.
Not only the numbers,
but the character
of the revived
was,
Edwards said,
unprecedented.
It involved
not only males
and females alike,
but children
as young as
four years,
and outbursts
of enthusiasm
in worship.
Some, he said,
weeping with
sorrow and distress,
others with
joy and love,
others with pity
and concern
for the souls
of their neighbors.
Edwards struggled
both to defend
and analyze
this eruption
in a faithful
narrative of
the surprising
work of God,
which was published
in England
in 1737.
But he had
hardly digested
the lessons
of the 1734-35
revival
before a second
wave of awakening
came to Northampton
in 1740
on the shoulders
of the celebrated
English preacher
George Whitefield.
Whitefield
had emerged
as one of the
princes of the
European awakeners,
a preacher
of fabulous
talent,
dramatic
intensity,
and superb
self-confidence.
In 1737,
he dedicated
himself to
establishing
an orphanage
in the new
American colony
of Georgia,
and undertook
a fundraising
preaching tour
of the colonies,
which quickly
turned into
a riot
of awakenings.
What had been
mere awakenings
before now
became a great
awakening
in British
North America?
And when
Whitefield came
to Northampton
to preach
and to recognize
Edwards as a
fellow laborer,
a fresh outbreak
of revivals
consumed not only
Edwards'
Northampton,
but much of
Western New England.
On the other hand,
Whitefield's preaching
also generated
angry criticism
from both
the Boston
elite,
who spurned
revivals
revivals as raw
enthusiasm,
and from
nervous country
parsons who
feared the
destabilizing effect
of mass revivals
on the peace
of their flocks.
By 1742,
the New England
clergy had become
polarized into
an old light
faction,
which condemned
the revivals,
and a new light
faction who
encouraged them
and who found
in Edwards
their principal
theorist of
revivals
and religious
experience.
Edwards not only
participated fully
as a preacher
in promoting
revivals,
delivering in
Enfield,
Connecticut,
his most famous
sermon,
Sinners in the
Hands of an Angry
God,
but he published
three important
defenses of
new light
revivalism.
Distinguishing
marks of a work
of the Spirit of
God in 1741,
some thoughts
concerning the
present revival
of religion
in 1742,
and a treatise
concerning the
religious affections
in 1746.
Of the three,
the religious
affections was
Edwards' most
profound effort,
laying out in
twelve signs,
as he put it,
the distinction
between true and
false religion,
and the right
place of the
emotions or
affections,
and he uses
the term
affections to
avoid the
pejorative term
passions,
in religious
experience.
Both some
thoughts concerning
the present
revival of
religion and
the religious
affections,
however,
betray signs of
stress in
Edwards,
since the
aftermath of
the Great
Awakening in
Northampton
proved to be a
severe disappointment
to Edwards,
as many of the
awakened gradually
subsided into
religious listlessness.
In 1744,
in an ill-considered
effort to
stimulate genuine
conversions,
Edwards reimposed
the test of a
public confession
of grace on new
members in the
church,
which had been
abandoned by
Solomon Stoddard.
The Northampton
church,
seething with
resentment instead
of repentance,
turned on
Edwards,
and in 1750,
Edwards was
forced to
resign.
Thrown upon the
wide ocean of
the world,
as he put it,
Edwards accepted
the offer of the
Boston commissioners
of the society for
propagating the
gospel in New
England to take
charge of the
Mohegan Indian
mission at
Stockbridge,
Massachusetts,
60 miles west
of Northampton.
He was an
indifferent missionary,
but the mission
work gave him
time to turn back
to his philosophical
notebooks.
And between
1751 and 1757,
Edwards produced
two manuscript
dissertations,
books, as he
called them,
on ontology and
ethics.
The first of them,
concerning the end
for which God
created the world,
and the other,
on the nature of
true virtue.
This, plus two
major treatises on
freedom of the
will in 1754,
and original sin
in 1758.
Freedom of the
will was the
greatest piece of
philosophical speculation
penned by an
American in the
18th century,
and the only one
which managed to
command any serious
European readership.
But its real
intent, as in so
much of Edwards'
work, was not so
much to articulate
philosophy or embrace
the Enlightenment,
but rather to
justify, in the most
enlightened vocabulary
and method available,
the ways of God
to man.
Edwards had
noticed how the
threat of Hobbes
and the threat of
Hobbes' bleak
materialism had
frightened the
daylights out of
religious thinkers
in the Enlightenment.
And he had also
noticed how Hobbes'
denial of free will
had touched off a
panicked flight,
even among Calvinists,
into affirmations of
human free will.
Even if those
affirmations, and that
free will, flew
straight into the face
of Calvinism's
teaching that God,
and not human free
will, determined the
outcome of all events.
Edwards shut the
door firmly on that
flight.
Calvinists, and for
that matter, anyone
who believed in a God
who was more than just
a well-intentioned
bumbler, no one
could run away from
the fact that a God
who was really God
determined everything.
But Edwards' great
achievement was then
to turn and demonstrate
in one logical sweep
after another how God's
determination of the
will did not deprive
anyone of freedom, much
less force anyone over
the cliff into
materialism.
And it was a logical
sweep.
Defenses of Calvinist
theology before the
Great Awakening had
stiffened unimaginatively
into the style and the
rhetoric of the
catechism, with certain
theological axioms
laid out, scholastic
style, and then adorned
with scriptural proof
texts, as if all that
was needed to halt the
Enlightenment's incoming
tide was a potent
biblical quotation or
two.
What has continuously
surprised readers of
Edwards on the
will was how very
unlike that model, the
catechism model, his
writing was.
And in truth, Freedom
of the Will reads as
much like a treatise on
psychology as an
apologetic for Calvinism,
as much like the
Republic of Letters as
it does the Synod of
Dort.
But this was because the
Enlightenment was
simultaneously Jonathan
Edwards' friend and
enemy.
His serene confidence in
traditional Calvinism made
him hostile to the
Enlightenment's
pretensions to base
human behavior on
reason and nature.
And it made him
receptive to the
notion that true
spiritual harmony was
possible only by
overcoming the
superficial allure of
reason and nature.
Yet, he believed just
as firmly that reason,
once it was sanctified by
conversion of the heart,
was an instrument to be
well used in examining
nature.
And Edwards'
intellectual life was
rooted in one of the
Enlightenment's principal
questions about
epistemology.
People who try to stand
astride of conflicting
intellectual movements
with one foot in one camp
and one foot in another,
or one foot in one answer,
or one foot in another
answer, are usually torn to
pieces by the conflict
between the two.
Edwards is that rare
exception who instead
turns the conflicts into
a creative intellectual
fusion, in this case, of
Enlightenment and
piety.
In so doing, Edwards gave
to Puritanism a new lease
on intellectual life in the
American mind and fashioned
a new evangelical form of
piety, a form which would
become one of the two great
long-term forces in the
history of American ideas.
