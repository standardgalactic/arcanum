Unlike wars, treatises, elections, or epidemics, the Enlightenment is an intellectual event.
And that's a warning sign that explanations and timelines and conflicts are going to be
a lot more messy and confusing than when you're dealing with the usual stock and trade of
history people, battles, kings, plagues.
For one thing, the Enlightenment is often thought of as an 18th century event.
And that is only partly true.
Because we can peg at least its remote beginnings as early as 1543, when Nicholas Copernicus
published his Revolutions of the Heavenly Bodies.
And the endings of the Enlightenment can be pegged as late as 1815, with the defeat of
Napoleon and the end, well, temporarily, as it turned out, of the French Revolution.
For another thing, the Enlightenment is often thought of as being an anti-religious event,
overturning the credibility of Christian explanations of the universe based on the Bible with scientific
ones based on careful observation and experimentation.
And this, too, is only partly true, since what Enlightenment science challenged was the principle
of automatic authority, whether it was the authority of the Bible or of Aristotle or of
logic itself.
But a good deal of the Enlightenment was composed of clergymen and other religious thinkers who
had no trouble finding, after some scientific sifting, that the Bible was more or less right
after all, and that Christianity was a good thing.
Maybe the most fundamental misperception of the Enlightenment is that it was a movement
about skepticism and criticism.
It certainly liked to maintain a fashionable flippancy toward conventional ways of thinking
and doing.
But the Enlightenment was also a very optimistic movement.
And its fundamental aim was not to entertain skepticism, but to banish it, and to find in science and
in scientific methods a better basis for certainty and for balanced living than Aristotle or Cicero
afforded.
If we had to boil the Enlightenment down to two basic attitudes, it would be these.
The primacy of reason.
The mind is not content simply with being told that something is true.
It's not even content with admitting that someone else can't exactly be proved wrong.
The mind has to be shown that something is true by standards of consistency and physical
evidence which satisfy one's own reason.
The alternatives to this are either A, a submission to dogmatic authority, which never really uncovers
anything useful, but just invites someone to be clever with words and the arrangement of
terms, or B, a cheap skepticism that nothing can ever be known for sure.
The first of these alternatives had been the chief operating notion of European thinkers since
the Middle Ages.
It was this, however, which Copernicus began to undermine in 1543 by suggesting that the
conventional Aristotelian understanding of the solar system, which put the earth at the
center and had the sun and the planets revolving in circles around it, was in error, and that
the sun rather than the earth was the center of the solar system.
However, the turmoil of the great religious wars of the 1500s and the 1600s, as well as
some severe problems within Copernicus' own theory, kept all of this in the realm of hypothesis
until the invention of the telescope and its use in 1610 by Galileo Galilei, whose direct
observations of the moon and the planets wrecked the authority of Aristotle for good.
Ten years later, the English nobleman, Sir Francis Bacon, published his Novum Gaunum, which called
upon his contemporaries to toss aside Aristotle and the teachers of scholastic logic and form
an acquaintance with things.
The best demonstration, said Bacon, by far is experience.
And it was high time that people began using their reason to stitch together the lessons
of experience into a new skein of knowledge which described nature, rather than putting
their reason to the service of the cobwebbed world of the scholastics.
The second great aspect of the Enlightenment was its reverence for the testimony of nature.
Because it was nature, newly measurable through such scientific instruments as the telescope
and the microscope, which afforded the raw materials upon which reason would operate.
In nature, diligent experimenters would discover the real order of things, not the artificial one
invented by Aristotle and the logic textbooks.
Isaac Newton, the most gifted mathematician of his age, and probably of subsequent ages, as
it has turned out, Newton relentlessly reduced the motions of physical bodies to the laws of
attraction at a distance, or gravity.
John Locke, with equal relentlessness, reduced the human mind to a passive receiver of sensations
from the body.
And Charles de Montesquieu, turning to politics and society, found government shaped, not according
to a single model handed down from heaven on a platter, but by the individual histories,
events, accidents, preferences, and religion of each nation.
Nature came first.
Then, analysis.
This is why people so often conclude that the chief enemy of the Enlightenment was religion.
In Italy, the Catholic Church tried to silence Galileo, while in England, Newton had to keep
his own very unorthodox religious opinions very much to himself.
And Locke was even indicted for heresy.
But the Enlightenment thought that its real enemy was skepticism, by which I mean the attitude
that nothing can be known for sure about anything.
And skepticism was no small threat in the 1600s.
Beginning in 1521, Protestant Europe and Catholic Europe commenced a bloodbath of religious warfare,
which lasted on and off until 1648, at the end of which neither Catholic nor Protestant had
achieved the upper hand.
Despite each side's claim to be representing the truth of God, both Catholics and Protestants
had to settle at the Treaty of Westphalia for no better result than an exhausted agreement
to leave each other alone.
Not surprisingly, more than a few Europeans decided that if you couldn't be sure whether
God was a Catholic or a Protestant, then there was no reason to be sure of anything.
Men do not recognize the natural infirmity of the mind, complained the French skeptic, Michel
de Montaigne.
It does nothing but ferret and search and is all the time turning, contriving and entangling
itself in its own work like a silkworm.
This skepticism, much more than any malevolent church court, threatened all hope of reaching
a real understanding of why Catholics and Protestants behaved the way they did, and why, in the largest
sense, the universe followed the pattern it did.
Scholastic logic had worked for so many centuries because it assumed the validity of its own foundations,
starting with certain accepted truths and arranging them in the patterns that supported your
conclusions.
But both science and the religious wars made that foundation unstable.
So the greatest work of the Enlightenment had to be done at the very beginning by showing
that something could be known at all.
And that was the work that fell to Ren√© Descartes.
The contribution of Descartes was to show how something could be known with certainty.
And the method he devised for this was, unlike the scholastics, to begin with doubt.
One could, said Descartes, doubt everything, or almost everything, since the one thing you could
not doubt, was the fact that you were doubting.
Cogito ergo sum.
I think, therefore I am.
From that single certainty, Descartes worked backward to certainty about God, about existence, and so forth.
Although always careful, to hop securely only from one indisputably clear and distinct idea to another.
Not just to arrange logical propositions.
What has to be borne in mind, though, was that the way Descartes laid out, from doubt to certainty,
still indisputably led back to God and Christianity.
That was what made Descartes and the Cartesian method so appealing to Harvard,
which by the 1680s had not enjoyed very much in the way of stability or certainty.
In 1654, President Dunster announced that he had gone the full length into separatism
and adopted the views of the Baptists,
who were then a tiny splinter group within English Puritanism,
who repudiated the baptism of children altogether.
And Dunster resigned the presidency of Harvard under pressure from the Massachusetts General Court.
The finances of the college were just as unstable.
Even with the income from John Harvard's legacy
and the contributions from the Massachusetts Treasury,
the entire budget of Harvard amounted to no more than 250 pounds per year.
And from there, matters got only worse.
Dunster was followed in the presidency by a clergyman, Charles Chauncey,
and a physician, Leonard Hoare,
and another clergyman, Uriah Oaks,
and then another physician, John Rogers.
A succession of weak presidents
who were so ill-equipped to run the college
that the ungoverned youths of Harvard drove one of them nearly to suicide.
Finally, in 1684, Harvard finally got its first real star president,
Increase Mather,
the pastor of the Old North Church in Boston
and the most famous minister of Boston in New England's second generation.
It was Mather who successfully fended off a threat from the royal government
to assert direct control of Harvard,
and who obtained the right of the Massachusetts General Court
to set the college up as an independent corporation.
And it was Mather who brought to Harvard
two of its most influential teachers,
the tutors John Leverett and William Brattle.
Brattle is the embodiment of the cautious Enlightenment.
The logic textbook Brattle wrote in 1687,
a compendium of logic according to the modern philosophy,
was the first beachhead of Cartesian logic in America.
And it adopts the Cartesian tactic of starting from doubt.
Again, starting not from authority
as with the traditional scholastic philosophy,
where you began with undisputed truths taken from Aristotle
and then arranged conclusions from them.
Rather, Brattle, as a Cartesian,
began with doubt and from doubt working towards certainty.
But plainly, the purpose Brattle had in view
was to undercut skepticism,
not to call into question truth itself.
What he wanted to do was to dig a new epistemological foundation
for Calvinist orthodoxy.
To doubt of things and to suppose them to be all false
only for the obtaining of more full and direct knowledge,
Brattle explained, is a laudable method.
Because doubt, he said,
was what showed the way to prove a truth
and demonstrate the same to others.
He was, all the same,
careful to limit the application of the Cartesian method
to philosophical questions,
not theological ones,
in a manner reminiscent of William Ames.
And like Ames again,
he considered that unbelief was not the fault of theology,
but grew instead out of the perverted will of the skeptic.
So this is very much a cautious approach
and embrace of Enlightenment thinking.
John Leverett, on the other hand,
seemed to have no use for caution at all.
Born to the habits of the New England merchant aristocracy,
the grandson of an early governor,
a layman,
and eventually Cambridge's representative
in the Massachusetts General Court,
Leverett assumed the presidency of Harvard in 1707
as though it was his by right.
Leverett was no particularly great thinker,
but he was deeply admiring
of Descartes and the New Philosophy.
And even more significant,
he discouraged Calvinist dogmatism
in favor of what he called
more generous principles.
Leverett would, in other words,
talk more about virtue than about redemption,
more about reasonableness than about sacred mystery.
And he put his entire support
behind the organization of a new church in Boston,
the Brattle Street Church,
whose manifesto of 1699
proclaimed the church congregational,
not by reason of scripture,
but by the light of nature.
Too late,
old Increase Mather
tried to block Leverett's ascension
to the Harvard presidency.
Even when the game was lost,
Mather's precocious son,
Cotton Mather,
hoped to pick up the cudgels
where his father had laid them down
and mounted his own campaign
to unseat Leverett.
He was wasting his time, of course.
And eventually,
with some bitterness,
the Mathers realized
that Harvard had become an outpost
of these generous principles
rather than Calvinistic ones.
When unhappy Calvinist
congregationalist ministers in Connecticut
decided that Leverett's Harvard
had gone too far
into Cartesian method
and the new philosophy
and organized a new college
of their own in New Haven,
Cotton Mather
steered the generosity
of another wealthy patron
of learning,
Elihu Yale,
to the new Connecticut College
instead of Harvard.
Harvard was not the only place
in America
which had to face
the challenges
a new philosophy
was offering
to an old learning.
The English colony of Virginia
had been founded
more than two decades
before Massachusetts Bay,
but its settlers
had no guiding
religious vision
and no incentive
to found colleges.
In fact,
not much incentive
to do anything much else
than hunger
after quick fortunes
in America's first
luxury commodity,
tobacco.
Like Massachusetts,
Virginia had been founded
as a private,
corporate enterprise
by the Virginia Company
in 1607.
Alas,
the Virginia Company
never paid
a single dividend
to its stockholders
and went bankrupt
in 1622.
At that point,
the Crown might have decided
to retrieve
the unhappy employees
of the company
in Virginia
and give up
on licensing
fruitless commercial
ventures in America.
But the Crown
wanted no responsibility
for American enterprises,
whether starting
or ending them.
And instead,
the Royal Government
in London
left the hapless
employees
of the Virginia Company
in Virginia
to organize
their affairs
in Virginia
as best they could
while sending out
a token governor
or two
to give some
semblance
of English authority
to matters.
Until 1685,
Crown interest
in America
never moved
much beyond
that kind
of tokenism.
The Crown
handed out
ridiculous awards
of land
in America
to court favorites.
William Penn's
Pennsylvania
in 1682.
The Carolinas
to the Carolina
proprietors
in 1660.
Maryland
to Lord Baltimore
in 1632.
New York
to the Duke
of York
in 1666
and so forth.
And for the most part,
the Royal Government
allowed the colonies
to develop
their own
ad hoc assemblies,
levying their own taxes
and behaving
almost as if
they were little
sovereignties
of their own.
With 3,000 ocean miles
between England
and America,
no one on either side
was much inclined
to complain.
At least not
until the end
of the 1600s.
But then
the attitudes
of the Imperial
planners in London
began to change
and for a very
unexpected reason.
So long
as colony planting
in America
looked pretty much
like digging
a bottomless
money pit,
the Royal Government
in London
wanted nothing
to do with
any responsibility
for colonial affairs.
By the end
of the 1600s,
however,
the colonies
had managed
to invert
this proposition
completely.
America had proven
so fertile
and the social
scum
and religious
eccentrics
England had sent
there
so unpredictably
resourceful
that the mother
country was beginning
to sustain
an unfavorable
balance of trade
with America.
What was more,
England's great
rivals,
the French,
had begun
to awaken
to the importance
of waging
imperial war
on England
through its own
North American
colonies.
And between
1690 and 1763,
France and England
became entangled
in a series
of proxy wars
in America
that forced
the British crown
to pour
vital military
resources
into the protection
of its North American
colonies.
In the process,
the British
could not help
noticing
several things
in passing.
First of all,
they noticed
that the Americans
were quite happy
to have the British
bear the brunt
of these imperial
expenses.
And secondly,
they noticed
that the Americans
were surprisingly
prosperous,
well-to-do,
and full of life's
good things.
All of them
unregulated
by British law.
all of them
doing the
imperial administration
not one bit
of good.
What made this
all the more
galling
was the casual
assumption
of so many
of the colonials
that they were
as perfectly
good Englishmen
as any that
could be found
in Britain.
The more
prosperous
the Americans
became,
the more
the most
prosperous
wanted to wear
the newest
English styles,
read the newest
English literature,
become members
of English
learned societies,
and in general
to behave
as though
they were
decent
English gentry.
And not
the Robinson Crusos
the earlier
generations in
America had been.
Throughout the
colonies,
and especially
among the
emergent elites,
writes early
American historian
Jack P. Green,
there was a
self-conscious
effort to
anglicize
colonial life
through the
deliberate
imitation of
metropolitan
institutions,
values,
and cultures.
They wanted,
in other words,
to think of
themselves primarily
as Britons,
albeit Britons
overseas,
rather than
the descendants
of convicts,
debtors,
and religious
oddballs.
Well,
if this was how
the Americans
wanted to behave,
then the empire
certainly understood
how it should be
treating them.
So,
from the
1690s
onwards,
Britain began
gradually reaching
for more and
more of the
control it
had once
spurned in
America as
too expensive.
And by the
same turn,
fewer and fewer
Americans
seemed to object
to it.
This included
the intellectual
life of the
colonies.
As much as
France is
routinely thought
of as the
national capital
of the
Enlightenment,
both the
French and the
rest of Europe
thought of
England as
the nation
of
Enlightenment
par excellence.
England had
a government
with a
parliament
far more
powerful,
and a
monarch far
less arbitrary
than any
other in
Europe.
It possessed
a laissez-faire
commercial culture
that gave
no automatic
economic points
to noblemen
over merchants.
It had an
established
Protestant church,
but by the
end of the
1600s and
the beginning
of the 1700s,
that church
was no longer
in the business
of persecuting
other religions,
and even the
bishops of the
church prided
themselves on
their broad-mindedness,
their
latitudinarianism
of thought.
And with the
lapsing of the
censorship laws
in England
in the 1690s,
Englishmen had
the most
unrestricted
and free-wheeling
press and book
culture in the
world.
The dawn of
the 1700s
became the
dawn of
an augustan
age of
literature
and wit,
of Alexander
Pope,
Joseph
Addison,
Samuel Johnson,
and it also
became the
dawn of an
era of
political
radicalism
and religious
ease.
So when,
at the end
of the 1600s,
the British
government
concluded that
it would be
a good idea
to harness
the American
horse more
securely to
the British
carriage,
it began
to do so
by imposing
new taxes,
by sending
out new
administrators,
and by
replicating in
the colonies
more and more
English
institutions.
When King
William and
Queen Mary
sent Francis
Nicholson to
Virginia as the
new royal
governor in
1691,
he not only
imposed a new
political regime
on Virginia,
but he
presented the
colonial assembly
with a bill
to organize
a college,
a college
to be
appropriately
named for
the English
monarchs
themselves,
William and
Mary.
It was
intended to
be a
perpetual
college of
divinity,
philosophy,
languages,
and other
good arts
and sciences,
which sounds
very much like
a good replay
of a Harvard
curriculum from
the 1640s.
But William and
Mary's first
president,
James Blair,
was a great
admirer of
John Locke.
And by the
1720s,
the library at
William and
Mary sprouted
the unusual
array of
books by
Bacon,
Locke,
and Newton.
By the time
the young
Thomas Jefferson
arrived at
William and
Mary in
1760 to
begin his
education,
its tutors
were already
renowned as
men of the
Enlightenment,
as profound
in most of
the useful
branches of
science,
with a
happy talent
of communication,
correct and
gentlemanly manners,
and an
enlarged and
liberal mind.
Something of
the same thing
happened in
Pennsylvania.
The charter,
which the king
gave to
William Penn
to organize a
settlement north
of Maryland in
1682,
contained no
references to
religious
eccentricity.
But the
silk-stocking
Penn had
in 1663
turned Quaker,
a bizarre
offshoot of
radical
Puritanism,
whose chief
prophet,
George Fox,
was a
one-time
cobbler,
and whose
followers were
denounced as
the dregs of
the common
people.
Penn indulgently
envisioned his
new colony as
a refuge for
his fellow
Quakers.
And over time,
his colony
emerged as
one of the
most commercially
thriving colonies
in British
North America.
Its chief
city,
Philadelphia,
became British
America's
de facto
capital.
But Penn
was never
able to
recruit more
than 10%
of the overall
immigration to
Pennsylvania from
the ranks of
British Quakerism.
And Pennsylvania
joined the
rush to
Anglicize to
become more
of a replica
of the home
culture in
England with
even more
verve than
Virginia.
Even Penn's
own sons
eventually
abandoned
Quakerism and
joined the
Church of
England.
The residual
hostility of
Pennsylvania
Quakers to
formal education
prevented
Pennsylvania from
developing a
Harvard or a
William and
Mary until
1740 and the
founding in that
year of the
Academy of
Philadelphia which
then became the
College of
Philadelphia and
then the
University of
Pennsylvania.
But the
College of
Philadelphia quickly
established itself
as a model of
Enlightenment
breeding.
And Philadelphia
became home by
the time of the
Revolution to a
coterie of
Enlightenment
intellectuals.
Benjamin Rush,
William and
John Bartram,
Benjamin Franklin,
David Rittenhouse,
Francis Allison,
John Ewing and
Samuel Stanhope
Smith, all of
whom accomplished
America's best
reconciliation of
the demands of
Newtonian science
with natural
religion.
The Enlightenment,
remarked Thomas
Jefferson, was
never so
advantageously taught
anywhere else in
America than in
Philadelphia.
Philadelphia.
In the end, not
even the
Connecticut
conservatives who
founded Yale
College in
1701 were
immune to the
blandishments of
the English-speaking
Enlightenment.
Although the Yale
curriculum was built
around the authors
that Harvard had
once prescribed,
Ames,
Bergerstike,
Heraboard, it
also allowed the
use of William
Brattle's logic
textbook.
By 1718, one
of the Yale
tutors, Samuel
Johnson, was
introducing Yale
undergraduates to
the reading of
John Locke.
And by 1730,
James Pierpont,
who had graduated
from Yale in
1718, found the
place corrupted
and ruined with
heresy, which was
the same thing as
saying that Yale
had become pretty
much the same
thing as Harvard.
And as if to
prove how
corrosive the
attraction of
Anglicization and
the new philosophy
might be, in
1722, the
rector of the
college, Timothy
Cutler, and
four of the
tutors publicly
renounced
Congregationalism and
took ship to
England to be
ordained as
priests of the
Church of
England.
The
Enlightenment,
apparently, had
won over the
colonies.
And the colonies
had shown
themselves only
too happy to
be won over.
And if that is
the conclusion
that we draw
from these
reviews of
facts, then
that is a
big mistake.
Because already,
the dissatisfied
energies of
religious revival
were about to
erupt.
