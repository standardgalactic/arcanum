One of the gifts of the Great Awakening to British North America was the founding of a new spate of colleges.
Princeton, which was the first foundation of the new lights, then Rhode Island College in 1765,
which became Brown University in 1804, to acknowledge the money poured into it by the Rhode Island Baptist merchants,
Nicholas and Joseph Brown.
Queens College, founded by Dutch sympathizers with the awakening among the Dutch Reformed Church in New Jersey,
and eventually to be known as Rutgers.
And Dartmouth College, which began as a missionary school for Indians,
but was moved by its founder, the New Light missionary, Eleazar Wheelock, to New Hampshire in 1770,
and renamed for the Earl of Dartmouth.
And these were only the colleges most directly nurtured by the awakening.
Two others, the College of Philadelphia, which, as we've seen, became the University of Pennsylvania,
and King's College in New York City, which was renamed Columbia after the American Revolution,
also, in varying degrees, bore the thumbprint of the awakening.
The College of Philadelphia, as you'll remember from an earlier lecture,
was organized originally as an academy,
but organized as an academy in a meeting hall in Philadelphia
originally built to accommodate that grand itinerant, George Whitefield,
on his many preaching tours through Philadelphia.
The academy's organizers quickly ensured that both the academy and the college that superseded it
were kept safe from Whitefield's evangelical enthusiasm, however.
And King's College, which opened its doors in 1754,
was deliberately designed as a foil for enthusiasm
by the Church of England's struggling representatives in the colonies.
Its first president, Samuel Johnson, had actually been one of the Yale apostates
from Congregationalism back in 1722.
That the Awakeners were interested in founding colleges at all may seem unusual,
given the cold shoulder that Harvard and then Yale turned to the Great Awakening.
George Whitefield had visited Harvard during his first great preaching tour of New England in 1740,
and he found Harvard not only scarce as big as one of our least colleges at Oxford,
and Whitefield was an Oxford grad.
After all, Whitefield sniffed Harvard had only one president, four tutors, and about 100 students.
But worse still, it was not far superior to our universities in piety,
a judgment that Whitefield did not intend as a compliment.
Discipline is at a low ebb, Whitefield wrote in his journal.
At Harvard, bad books are becoming fashionable among the tutors and students.
When Whitefield's journals were published, as they were in the colonial newspapers in serial form,
Harvard's old-light president, Edward Holyoke, was not amused.
And in December 1744, Holyoke and the Harvard faculty went to the unusual length of publishing
The Testimony of Harvard College Against George Whitefield,
accusing Whitefield of enthusiasm, censoriousness, and delusive management
of the money Whitefield had been raising for his Georgia orphanage,
and just accusing him of a general spirit of anti-intellectualism.
Well, none of this gave Whitefield much pause, if only because the new lights,
like their pietist counterparts in England, in Germany, in the Netherlands,
and their Puritan forebears, had an entirely different notion of how human psychology worked.
The Enlightenment's glorification of reason and nature was all well and good, argued the pietists,
but only if one did not forget the limits placed upon the operation of the reason
by the countervailing power of the other faculties, and especially the will.
The celebrated German pietist, August Hermann Franke, confessed that as a theological student
in Lutheran Germany, he had originally understood Christianity only in my reason and in my thought.
It was not until he had experienced repentance, buskampf, that all sadness and unrest of my heart
was taken away at once, and I was immediately overwhelmed, as with a stream of joy,
so that with full joy I praised and gave honor to God, who had shown me such great grace.
Now, this was not necessarily an anti-intellectual stance.
It was, in fact, little more than an updating of scholastic-style voluntarism.
And it was shared, without any dimming of intellectual energy, by Blaise Pascal, by John Wesley, and by Jonathan Edwards.
But it could easily sound anti-intellectual.
Nor was Whitefield, as I said, an Oxford graduate, necessarily a mental slouch,
but when he warned Edward Holyoke that learning without piety will only render you more capable of promoting the kingdom of the devil,
Whitefield was leaving the awakening as open to abuse,
fully as much as Harvard's embrace of reason had left it vulnerable to the blandishments of lukewarm religion.
The dimensions of that abuse showed up in spades, not at Harvard, but at Yale in 1741.
Thomas Clapp had taken over as rector of Yale in April of 1740.
He was determined to overhaul the students and the curriculum to move Yale from a good state to a perfect one.
And, mistaking Whitefield as a vehicle for accomplishing that, Clapp unwisely invited Whitefield to preach to the students on October 25th, 1740.
Whitefield was even less impressed by Yale than he had been by Harvard.
It has one rector, he wrote, three tutors and about a hundred students,
and with no remarkable concern amongst them concerning religion.
But in Yale's case, things did not stay that way.
Over the next three months, the spiritual life of Yale College was quickened.
The students in general became serious, Jonathan Edwards recorded.
Many of them remarkably so, and much engaged in the concerns of their eternal welfare.
But they also became tumultuous and rebellious against what Whitefield had darkly described as an unconverted ministry.
James Davenport, a Yale graduate of 1732 and a Whitefield wannabe,
showed up in Connecticut claiming direct inspiration from God
and sponsoring a bonfire of books, principally on divinity.
And whilst the books were in the flames, according to one observer,
the mob, Davenport had whipped up, cried out,
Thus the souls of the authors of those books, those of them that are dead, are roasting in the flames of hell.
And that the fate of those surviving would be the same unless speedy repentance prevented.
Clapp tried to appease the uproar by inviting Jonathan Edwards to deliver the commencement address.
But by the beginning of the next school year, in September 1741,
the trustees of Yale were forced to pass a resolution threatening that
any student of this college who shall directly or indirectly say that the rector,
either of the trustees or tutors, are hypocrites, carnal, or unconverted men,
he shall for the first offense make a public confession in the hall,
and for the second offense be expelled.
And to show just how much they meant it,
when a junior student, David Brainerd,
offhandedly snorted that one of the tutors,
Chauncey Whittlesey,
had no more grace than a chair,
Rector Clapp hauled Brainerd onto his carpet
and expelled him.
If Clapp thought this would serve as an example,
he was wrong.
Brainerd left Yale to become a personal protege of Jonathan Edwards.
He launched a career as a missionary to the Indians
and died of tuberculosis under Edwards' own roof in 1747,
leaving in Edwards' hands
a highly melodramatic and devotional diary,
which Edwards then published as a memorial to Brainerd's integrity
and Yale's stinginess of heart.
Brainerd's journal went on to become one of the great religious bestsellers
of the next century.
Given this kind of reception,
no one could be surprised if the Awakeners decided
to take their interests elsewhere
and begin the string of collegiate alternatives
I listed at the beginning of this lecture.
But even then, the results turned out to be a very mixed bag.
If only because colleges founded around a valorization of the will
rather than the intellect
have a hard time justifying their existence
and usually either wink off when the will grows weary
or allow themselves to be transformed into halls of reason
just like the others simply to justify their existence.
The so-called Shepherd's Tent in New London, Connecticut,
a radical New Light college foundation,
was forced to close down
and transfer its short-lived operations to Rhode Island.
Evangelical Presbyterians in Pennsylvania
who applauded Whitefield
and who found themselves shunned
by the official Presbyterian organizations
organized a similar ministerial training school
made of logs cut out of the woods
near Neshaminy, Pennsylvania.
And it was known as the Log College.
But when the College of New Jersey
was chartered by Evangelical Presbyterians
across the Delaware River in New Jersey in 1746
and which of course becomes Princeton
then the Log College was absorbed into the new institution.
The College of New Jersey, Princeton
itself became something of a marker
of how difficult it was to sustain the will for revival
within the tightly mannered structures
of 18th century collegiate education.
Founded as it was through the initiative
of three of Whitefield's Presbyterian admirers,
Jonathan Dickinson, Aaron Burr, and Ebenezer Pemberton,
the new college was generally perceived
as a statement of protest by New Lights
against Yale's treatment of David Brainerd.
If it had not been for the treatment
received by Mr. Brainerd at Yale,
Aaron Burr remarked,
New Jersey College would never have been erected.
On the other hand,
the college had more than enough trouble
trying to keep from going
the same way that Brainerd did,
the same way that the Shepherd's Tent did,
and in fact, it actually had trouble
keeping its presidents from literally
going the way Brainerd did and dying.
The first of the presidents
of the College of New Jersey,
Jonathan Dickinson,
was a Yale graduate, class of 1706,
who had been called to minister
to a community of New England migrants
in Elizabethtown, New Jersey.
But within a year of founding the college,
Dickinson was dead.
So leadership of the college was transferred
to another New England transplant,
and that was Aaron Burr,
whose principal credential for the job
was that he happened to be
Jonathan Edwards' son-in-law.
Burr moved the college
first to his own hometown of Newark,
and then in 1753
to land contributed
to the college trustees
by the town fathers
of the village of Princeton.
It delighted
Esther Edwards Burr,
the wife of Aaron Burr
and daughter of Edwards,
to find a considerable awakening
in the college.
And by February of 1757,
it looked to her
exactly like gods
descending into the temple
in a cloud of glory.
But Aaron Burr died
of malaria that fall,
and when the trustees
brought Jonathan Edwards
to Princeton
as his son-in-law successor,
Edwards died as well
from the complications
of a smallpox inoculation
on March 22nd, 1758.
Esther Edwards Burr herself
died two weeks later,
leaving orphaned
a daughter, Sally,
and a son, Aaron Jr.,
a son who would grow up
to become vice president
of the United States
and one of the most notorious scoundrels
in American history.
For the next decade afterwards,
election as president of Princeton
came increasingly to look like
the kiss of death.
Samuel Davies
succeeded Edwards,
but collapsed and died
under the strain
of the work
in February 1761.
Davies was followed
by Samuel Finley,
who actually survived
for five years
in office
before death removed him,
too,
in July of 1766.
By this point,
the fires of controversy
over the Great Awakening
had cooled considerably,
and in 1758,
the quarreling factions
among the Presbyterians
had worked out
a gingerly reconciliation,
which they hoped to crown
by recruiting
as the next president
of Princeton
a Presbyterian,
who,
if not exactly
the first choice
of anyone,
was at least
the least objectionable choice
in everyone's mind.
And so the choice
fell to John Witherspoon,
who was identified
with neither
the pro-awakening
or anti-awakening factions,
not identified with them
largely because
he was a Scotsman
and had never been
in America.
The arrival
of John Witherspoon
at Princeton
in 1768
has always been regarded
as something
of a watershed
in American intellectual life,
and with good reason.
For one thing,
he actually lived
long enough
at Princeton
until 1794
to make a difference
as the college's president,
long enough,
in fact,
to serve
in the Continental Congress
as one of New Jersey's
representatives
and to sign
the Declaration
of Independence,
the only clergyman
to do so.
For another thing,
Witherspoon
was successful
in making
moderation
into an aggressive
quality
rather than just
an exercise
in appeasement.
Coming to the attention
of the college trustees
as a moderate
in the Church of Scotland
who could jolly
along the argumentative,
Witherspoon carried
with him
Scottish Presbyterianism's
old-worldish sense
of the Church's
place within society,
of the idea
of covenant
family religion,
on the theory
of a sacramental
educational religion.
Not the separatism,
not the voluntarism
in New England
congregationalism,
and not the wildfire
conversion enthusiasm
of the awakening.
Or,
looking at him
another way,
the Princeton trustees,
probably unwittingly,
could scarcely have hit
upon an orthodox
Calvinist theologian
anywhere on either side
of the English-speaking
Atlantic
less similar
to Jonathan Edwards
than John Witherspoon.
For those reasons,
Witherspoon had hardly
grasped the levers
of power at Princeton
before he set his face
against the influences
that had called
Princeton into being
in the first place.
The Tudors,
Joseph Periam,
and Jonathan Edwards
the Younger,
along with the divinity
professor,
John Blair,
were all straight-up
card-carrying
Edwardsians.
Edwards the Younger,
especially,
as his father's son,
and oddly doomed
to repeat
most of the confrontations
that had dogged
his father's career,
were the paladins
and flag-bearers
of Edwardsian thinking.
Witherspoon
promptly drove them out.
It was not just
revivalism, however,
that made Witherspoon
suspicious of the
Edwardsians.
He had little truck
either with Edwards'
appropriation of
Bishop Barclay's
immaterialism.
And to understand
the importance of that,
we have to understand
what Scotland meant
to the Enlightenment
in Witherspoon's day.
Until the 18th century,
Scotland was regarded
as a cultural backwater,
a junior partner
of what Scotland's
English overlords
ungraciously called
the United Kingdom.
But when the English
finally shut off
all access
to their universities,
once and for all,
to non-Church of England
people,
they inadvertently
handed the minor
Scottish universities
at Edinburgh,
St. Andrews,
and Glasgow
an enormous gift.
While Oxford
and Cambridge,
the official
Church of England
universities,
sank into
contented conformity,
the brightest minds
among Britain's
non-conformists
headed to the only
universities open
to them,
the Scottish ones.
And with them,
almost by default,
came the Enlightenment,
as Scotland's
universities blossomed
after the 1720s
with solutions
to English
philosophies
unsolved problems.
One of these problems
came directly
from John Locke.
Remember
that Locke
did not believe
that we actually
could know
the objects
of our ideas
directly.
He believed
that we know
only our
ideas
of the objects
so that ideas
represent
objects to us
rather than
having the objects
presented
directly to our
consciousness.
But he was
confident,
notwithstanding,
that we could
rely on those
ideas
to tell our
minds
what is
a true
or at least
probable story
about the objects
we were sensing.
an assumption
for which
Bishop Barclay
pointed out
Locke had
absolutely no
worthwhile evidence.
Barclay,
as it turned out,
was not the only
one who saw
problems
with Locke's
representational
realism.
Francis Hutchison
of the University
of Glasgow
objected that
Locke's
description
of how we
know
was impoverished
and,
so to speak,
unrealistic.
first,
because it
made minds
perfectly
passive
in the
knowing process,
and second,
because Locke's
description
failed to
account for
why minds
have ideas
about things
which mere
sensations
cannot account
for.
For example,
someone gazing
at a painting
actually senses
only
oil on canvas.
yet that
same person
perceives
beauty,
a fitness
far beyond
what lines
and colors
and shapes
and oil
add up to.
In the same
way,
a virtuous
act
is perceived
by a mind
not just as an
act,
but as something
which is beautiful.
And it moves
the perceiver
to a response
of moral approval,
which again
is more than
the mere
act of perception
would seem
to provoke.
This implied
for Hutchison
the existence
of a power,
of a capacity,
which he called
the moral sense,
which moves
everyone
to recognize
beauty and virtue
for what they are,
and which ensured
that morality
was not just
a fluctuating experience,
which varies
according to our
sensations or situations,
no matter how varied
our individual
situations or experiences,
the moral sense
that we are all
equipped with
enables us
to sort through
the mass
of sensations
we receive
and to perceive
what is true,
right,
and beautiful.
But more than
Hutchison,
it was Thomas Reed
who gave this
moral sense
epistemology
the enormous
influence it would
achieve in the
18th century.
Bishop Barclay
had helped
cripple
what he thought
were the
atheistic tendencies
in Locke
by showing
purely on
Locke's own terms
that Locke
could have
no assurance
that his ideas
corresponded
to anything
in the outside world.
This was what
allowed Barclay
to step in
and assert
the need for God.
And God
guarantees
such a connection
between our ideas
and what exists
in the outer world
by both giving
minds their ideas
and by upholding
the external reality
they represent.
But all that this
seemed to suggest
to another Scotsman,
David Hume,
was complete
intellectual skepticism.
I mean,
granted that Barclay
was right
about our inability
to know for sure
whether our ideas
correspond to anything
in the external world.
Why should we then
assume that God
makes the connections
for us?
Why assume that there
are any
connections?
We perceive
these connections
to be sure,
we even dignify them
with names like
cause and effect,
but that was
just as likely
a mere
personal prejudice
or mental habit.
Barclay could invoke
God as he liked,
Hume shrugged,
but even God
might just be
another mental habit
we had fallen into
so that we could
make connections
between our ideas.
Well,
in his
The Human Mind
on the Principles
of Common Sense
in 1764,
Reed observed
that there was
a practical
common consensus
among everyone
that there is
a reality
which exists
outside the mind
and its ideas.
Bishop Barclay's
immaterialism
notwithstanding.
And without trying
to explain
how this worked
or implying
that one could know
how it worked,
the fact was
there was a
common sense
which attested
to the real existence
of objects
outside the mind
and it was
so elemental
and so reflexive
a fact of consciousness
that denying it
or questioning it
or being cleverly
philosophical about it
was absurd.
This appeal
to common sense
not only threw
Hume's skepticism
back into his face,
but it permitted
Reed to object
to Locke's
representationalism
and insist that
not only does
an external world
exist,
but we may know it
directly
without mediating
ideas
blurring them.
Objects are
therefore presented
immediately
to our consciousness
and to deny
their reality
is,
on that score,
tantamount to idiocy.
One of the great
attractions of
Hutchison's
reads common sense
philosophy
was the neatness
with which it
intersected with
traditional scholastic
appeals
to natural law
and with what was
becoming a new
political science
of natural rights,
something which was
also pioneered
by Locke.
Now, strictly speaking,
this was a good
distance removed
from orthodox
Calvinism.
Calvinists of the
stricter sort
wondered where
Reed or Hutchison
planned to explain
how sin
entered into this
picture of natural
perceptions of
virtue and reality,
or what capacity
sinners had
to understand
natural law
if it existed
at all
outside Scripture.
But it was not
wholly beyond
the grasp
of moderate Calvinists
who preferred
some form of
accommodation
with the
Enlightenment.
And it was
within that
circle of
moderates
that John
Witherspoon
was located.
The common
sense philosophy
had a number
of intellectual
gifts
to bestow.
First of all,
the common
sense philosophy
taught
that minds
not only
perceive the
world directly
as it is,
they also
simultaneously
render a
judgment
about the
certainty
of that
world
which no
honest mind
can avoid
making.
Therefore,
Witherspoon
offered what
we have to
call an
intellectualist
account of
human psychology,
not a
voluntarist
one like
Edwards,
because minds
are incapable
of denying
the judgments
which common
sense makes.
Will simply
does not
enter into it.
Secondly,
just as
common sense
dictates our
perception of
the reality
of the external
world,
it also
reveals certain
fundamental moral
principles within
us.
Everyone
possesses a
moral sense
which causes
them to see
and approve
virtue and
beauty.
And it does
so in so
immediate a
fashion that
these truths
may even be
said to be
self-evident.
Self-evident
in that they
do not
require
explanation,
they do not
require divine
illumination.
You see
something which
is beautiful
and immediately
you respond
by recognizing
it as
beautiful.
The reason
for that
cannot be
limited strictly
to the mind
as a response
to material
subjects or
material objects.
Rather,
when the mind
responds with
beauty,
it can only
be because
there is
operating
within the
human consciousness
itself a
factor, a
moral sense
which stimulates
you to
recognize the
thing which
is beautiful.
Third,
just as
Reed worked
backwards or
inductively from
the fact that
all minds
intuitively
understand the
objective reality
of the world,
rather than as
Locke and
Edwards analyzing
the mind and
then deciding
whether it
can know such
reality,
so all our
truths about
consciousness,
the world,
or God,
must be built
up in like
method by
strict
induction
from facts.
Now, of course,
this Scottish
common sense
philosophy
also had some
serious dangers.
dangers, but
in the 1770s,
those dangers
were more
than compensated
for by the
way that
common sense
thinking allowed
moderate
Calvinists,
in fact,
allowed almost
any English
Protestant,
to have a
rational epistemology
without needing
to resort to the
radical immaterialism
of Edwards
or the
anti-intellectual
enthusiasms
of the
awakeners.
From this
synthesis,
this common
sense philosophy,
together with
this moderate
Calvinism
represented by
John Witherspoon,
would flower
the first
creative era
of what I
called in the
first lecture
the American
conversation
about ideas
between religion
and the
enlightenment,
between God
and nature,
a conversation
that in many
ways we still
participate in.
