Nothing in the federal constitution anticipated the emergence of political parties.
James Madison had hoped that one of the chief strengths of the constitution would be its tendency to break and control the violence of faction.
Jefferson, in one of his characteristic moments of rhetorical windiness, declared that allegiance to a party was the last degradation of a free and moral agent, and that if I could not go to heaven but with a party, I would not go there at all.
Hamilton joined the chorus.
We are attempting by this constitution, he said, to abolish factions and to unite all parties for the general welfare.

Federalist and the Jeffersonian or Democratic Republican, or simply Republican parties.
Federalist and Republican clubs and newspapers sprang up.
Candidates began presenting themselves to the voters as Federalists or Republicans.
And as I mentioned in that lecture on Jefferson, in 1804, in the most shocking demonstration of how deeply the idea of party had seized hold of political life, Alexander Hamilton was mortally wounded in a duel fought with Jefferson's most rakish disciple, Aaron Burr.
Everyone deplored party, and everyone joined in, each blaming the other for starting the process, each blaming the other for making their own party organization necessary.
The Federalists have generally come off the worse in American historical memory, although it can be somewhat difficult to understand why.
Hamilton had seen during the Confederation how easily the jealous interests of landholders and land speculators in Virginia and Pennsylvania and Connecticut could paralyze the very breath of the Republic.
Everywhere in the States, Hamilton found provincialism, small-mindedness, bad habits, and oligarchy.
And that could only be eliminated, in Hamilton's mind, by ruthlessly subordinating the bickering state governments to a strong central government, or even reducing the states to administrative units of the federal government.
And valorizing an economy in which worth and achievement could be measured in the form which is, at the end of the day, the form which is most indifferent to hierarchies of color or inheritance, cash money.
This won for Hamilton and his Federalist allies the approval of city merchants, urban workers, and most of New England.
It also won him the vituperation of Jefferson and his Republican followers, and it also got Hamilton a reputation for cold-blooded authoritarianism.
Jefferson convinced himself that the Federalists were nothing but an alliance of the old refugees and Tories and American merchants who had sold their souls to the British through trading on British capital.
They wished for everything which would approach our new government to a monarchy.
This was a strange set of accusations in the ears of the Federalists.
Hamilton left the government in 1796, refusing to use his insider information as Treasury Secretary to speculate in Western land,
and even mocking himself as one of those public fools who sacrifice private to public interest at the certainty of ingratitude and obloquy.
John Adams never owned more than the modest middling farmstead of the Adamses at Quincy,
and the major Federalist political voices were all those, like Fisher Ames, of lawyers with no independent family wealth,
who often ruined themselves financially in civil service.
If the new republic had any likely candidates for an aristocracy,
clearly the best on offer were Thomas Jefferson or John Randolph of Roanoke.
As Fisher Ames bitingly remarked,
the chief offense of Hamilton's liberal economic program was that a debt-compelling government is no remedy to men who have lands and Negroes and debts and luxury,
but neither trade, nor credit, nor cash, nor habits of industry, or of submission to a rigid execution of law.
As a result, Ames snarled,
Jefferson's Democratic Republicans cry liberty,
but mean, as all party leaders do, power.
And power was what they got.
In 1800, the Federalist, John Adams, ran for re-election to the presidency,
but lost to Jefferson.
Jefferson, running with Aaron Burr as his vice president,
Jefferson's and the Federalists by 73 to 65 votes in the Electoral College.
53 of Jefferson's votes came from the South,
which hardly made Jefferson the uniform favorite of the nation.
But that did nothing to discourage Jefferson from looking upon his election as the Revolution of 1800,
a mandate to undo everything Hamilton and the Federalists had accomplished.
He pledged in his inaugural to look above party.
We have been called by different names,
even though, as he added, we are brethren of the same principle.
In fact, we are all Republicans.
We are all Federalists.
Noble, generous sentiments.
But privately, Jefferson hoped to sink Federalism into an abyss from which there shall be no resurrection of it.
Well, in practice, Federalism did not sink so willingly into an abyss.
It was never again a national force,
and it sent itself into terminal political disgrace in 1814
when New England Federalists dallied with the idiotic notion of seceding from the Union
during the War of 1812
in order to squirm free of the Jeffersonian policies that had led the United States into that war.
Disloyalty, not aristocracy, became Federalism's cup of hemlock.
But the Federalist economic policies that Hamilton has helped to cement into place
were already set too firmly for Jefferson to dislodge them.
The charter for Hamilton's National Bank,
which we talked about as part of Hamilton's economic program
as Secretary of the Treasury in Lecture 10,
ran until 1811,
and Jefferson had to wait until the election of his hand-picked successor
and Secretary of State, James Madison,
before that charter could be cancelled.
When the ongoing wars of the French and the British
threatened to put American shipping on the North Atlantic
in the crosshairs of both warring navies,
Jefferson thought he could solve the problem
simply by an embargo of all American trade with them
and living off the produce of virtuous American farmers.
Instead, Jefferson's embargo triggered the first national economic collapse.
Hamilton might have said,
I told you so.
The Republicans preferred to blame this
on the evil machinations of Great Britain.
And there was just enough mean-spirited British encouragement
given from British Canada to hostile Indian tribes on the frontier
to give this a coating of credibility.
Enough credibility, in fact,
to send Jefferson's successor, Madison,
galloping off after the British by declaring war in 1812
and expecting to annex Canada as a result.
But without Hamilton's national bank,
there was no money to fund an army or a navy.
And so the American armies stumbled from one defeat to another,
punctuated with a handful of victories
in places where the victories got them nothing.
And the American navy spent most of the war,
apart from a few morale-lifting ship-to-ship combats,
neatly bottled up in American ports by British ships of the line.
And without federally funded manufacturing on the Hamiltonian model,
there were no uniforms and weapons for the army
and no national roads to assist them in getting from one place to another.
The War of 1812 cruelly revealed the inadequacies of Jeffersonian economic policy.
Our armies went to the frontier clothed in the fabrics of the enemy.
Our munitions of war was gathered as chance supplied them.
And the whole struggle was marked by the prodigality,
waste, and privation of a thriftless nation,
complained John Pendleton Kennedy.
And it was these disasters of the War of 1812,
which Kennedy believed opened our eyes to some important facts.
The principal important fact,
in the view of the younger generation of Jeffersonians,
was that too much Jeffersonianism might be too much of a good thing.
Henry Clay, who represented Kentucky alternately in the House and the Senate,
began his political life as an ardent Jeffersonian Democratic Republican.
He helped engineer the defeat of the recharter
of Hamilton's Bank of the United States in 1811.
And he was the most malevolent of the Warhawks
who agitated James Madison into declaring war on Britain in 1812.
But the war left Henry Clay, the sadder but wiser Jeffersonian.
And in 1816, the repentant Clay began singing a very different song
about the need for a national bank,
for government-sponsored internal improvement projects
to build roads and canals and dredge harbors,
and for the erection of protective tariffs on imports
in order to shield American manufacturing from killer competition from abroad.
The embarrassments of the War of 1812
gave enough persuasiveness to this talk
that Clay was able to navigate a bill
for a second bank of the United States through Congress.
And Madison's successor in the presidency,
James Monroe,
gave a reluctant blessing to funding for a national road,
a federally financed highway
that would extend from Cumberland, Maryland in the east
all the way to the Illinois Territory in the west.
The result of this, however, was to split
the old Democratic-Republican Party.
And a good deal of the split was located
along the axis of the Three-Fifths Clause.
John Randolph of Roanoke warned that
if Congress possesses the power to do what is proposed,
they may emancipate every slave in the United States.
If Congress has the kinds of power
that Hamilton and now Clay were arguing it did
for national roads and for banks,
the central government had that kind of power in economics,
why, warned Randolph,
why shouldn't it one day claim to have a similar power
to abolish slavery?
Well, at the time,
this seemed like seeing ghosts through bedsheets.
I mean, Henry Clay himself was a slaveholder.
And his state, Kentucky, legalized slavery.
But in the long run,
Randolph of Roanoke was right.
Clay became, despite his slaveholding,
an ardent proponent of colonizing American slaves
out of the United States
and gradually eliminating slavery from American law.
And Clay's most famous disciple
would be another Kentuckian
who really did use the power
of the national government to abolish slavery.
His name was Abraham Lincoln.
For more than two decades
after Jefferson's revolution of 1800,
the Constitution's three-fifths clause
guaranteed that the presidency
would go almost routinely
to a Southerner,
a Jeffersonian,
and a slaveholder.
But by 1824,
Jefferson's old Democratic-Republican party,
with Clay at the head of one faction,
had fractured so badly as a party
that the presidential election
was no longer quite so predictable.
John Quincy Adams,
the Jeffersonian son
of the last Federalist president,
had served President James Monroe
as Secretary of State,
and that cast Quincy Adams
as heir presumptive to the presidency in 1824,
just as it had Monroe
and Madison before him.
Adams, however,
was challenged by the ambitions
of Henry Clay.
And in turn,
Clay and Adams
were challenged
by a pure,
uncut,
undiluted Jeffersonian,
General Andrew Jackson
of Tennessee,
a slaveholder
and the commanding general
in the most important victory
the United States had won
in the War of 1812
at New Orleans.
Jackson roared
from out of nowhere
to win the popular vote.
But he failed to capture
a majority
in the Electoral College.
So under the rules
laid down in the Twelfth Amendment
to the Constitution,
the election was thrown
into the House of Representatives,
where Henry Clay
was the Speaker of the House.
Unable to summon up
enough votes
to win the presidency
for himself,
Clay at least preferred
to stop Andrew Jackson.
And so Clay threw his support
in the House of Representatives
behind Quincy Adams
and elected him president.
Adams hoped
to pull down
the remaining resistance
to what Clay
was now calling
his American system
of banking,
internal improvements,
and tariffs.
But rumors
that Quincy Adams
had struck
a corrupt bargain
with Henry Clay
for the election
robbed Adams
of the political momentum
he needed.
And in 1828,
the military chieftain,
as Henry Clay
disdainfully called
Andrew Jackson,
was swept
into the presidency
on a wave
of national enthusiasm
and by the united votes
provided by the
Three-Fifths Clause
in the South.
The two terms
that Andrew Jackson
spent in the White House
were much more successful
as a revolution
than Jefferson's
in 1800.
Bills for funding
internal improvements,
so beloved of Henry Clay,
were vetoed.
Tariffs
were scaled back
because
the slave interests
did not like tariffs.
The slave interests
and the agricultural interests
as a whole
depended on the purchase
of foreign imports
and the export
of their own
agricultural products.
And therefore,
as good Jeffersonians,
they found the tariffs
were a tax
that would reduce them
to dependence.
And so the tariffs
went the way
of the internal improvements.
And the second bank
of the United States
that Clay had labored
so hard
to put into place
was smashed
by Andrew Jackson's
merciless veto
of its rechartering
in 1834.
For Henry Clay,
the brutal imposition
of pure Jeffersonianism
by Andrew Jackson
wiped out any pretense
that Clay
or Quincy Adams
or Jackson
still belonged
to some single
unified Jeffersonian party.
Jefferson himself
had mordantly anticipated
that when the Republicans
should have put
all things under their feet,
they would schismatize
among themselves.
And indeed,
they did.
In January of 1834,
Clay called for the creation
of a new political coalition
based on his American system
and called Whigs,
a revival of the old name
of the revolutionaries
in 17th century England
and 18th century America
who had opposed
the rule of the military
and the tyranny of force
and who now claimed
the mantle
of liberal republicanism.
The Whigs of the present day,
announced Clay
in a speech
on the floor of the Senate
on April 14th, 1834,
are opposing
executive encroachment,
meaning Andrew Jackson,
and a most alarming extension
of executive power
and prerogative.
They are fettering out,
ferreting out,
the abuses
and corruptions
of an administration
under a chief magistrate
who is endeavoring
to concentrate
in his own person
the whole powers
of the government.
And his purpose,
said Clay,
was to protect
the one
unextinguished light
burning in the cause
of the people
of the Constitution
and of civil liberty.
Henry Clay's admirer,
William Brownlow,
of Tennessee,
was even less polite
on the subject
of what the Whigs thought
of Andrew Jackson.
The elevation
to the presidency
of this wicked man
and vulgar hero,
said Brownlow,
was the greatest curse
that ever befell
this great
and growing republic.
Clay's Whigs
were never
a dominant
political party.
They only
elected two presidents,
William Henry Harrison
and Zachary Taylor,
both of whom
managed to die
in office.
And the party itself
was practically defunct
after 1856.
The unhappy
Henry Clay
ran twice more
for president
in 1836
and in 1844
and was
twice more defeated.
And so the Whigs
have come down
to us,
in the words
of Henry Adams,
as the party
of feeble ideas
and even more
of feeble candidates.
But this is a serious
underestimation
of the Whigs.
In the teeth
of Jeffersonian
dominance
of national politics,
they not only
forged an independent
national party,
but they built it up
so rapidly
that after only
six years
of formal organization,
they had successfully
captured the presidency
for the first time.
They were exceptionally
good at winning
the allegiance
of first-time voters
after 1836
and holding them
thereafter.
When they lost,
as they did
in 1844,
it was often
by heartbreakingly
thin margins.
And when they won,
it was usually
because of their
very deft capacity
for seizing
on the failures
of their opponents
and borrowing
the campaign tactics
of their opponents
for themselves.
But their most
surprising achievement
was the forging
of a unique
Whig political culture,
which,
more than any
differences
on specific policies,
set the Whigs apart
and, in fact,
set them apart
from the Federalists
because the Federalists
had otherwise
shared much
of the same
cultural outlook
as the Jeffersonians.
At the core
of the Whig
cultural identity
was a burning hatred
for Andrew Jackson,
who had become
the principal force
behind what was now
simply being referred to
as the Democratic Party.
To the Whigs,
Jackson symbolized
militarism
and power
and the death
of Republican virtue,
reason,
and liberty.
As a plantation owner
and a slave owner
and an enemy
to banks
and improvements
and tariffs,
Jackson symbolized
the wrong-headed
dedication
of the Democrats
to Jefferson's obsession
with the virtuous farmer.
The Whigs
attracted merchants
and the new owners
of industrial factories
and their investors,
along with those farmers,
virtuous or not,
who were involved
in commercial
cash crop agriculture
rather than
independent
subsistence farming.
To protect
their merchant
and industrial constituents,
the Whigs
backed
Clay's American system
of federally sponsored
programs
of internal improvements,
of tariffs
to protect
domestic industry,
and the revival
of a national bank.
But this only spoke
to policies.
It was the creation
of a Whig culture
which was the Whigs'
most remarkable achievement.
For just as the Whigs
favored the transformation
of the nation
by internal improvement,
so they allied themselves
with those
who were most interested
in transforming the nation
by moral improvement.
And that included
the collegiate
moral philosophers
that we looked at
in the last lecture
and the evangelical
Protestant revivalists
whom we saw on display
in lecture 11,
all of whom joined
with the Whigs
in advertising
the virtues,
not just of internal
improvements,
but of personal
improvements
like thrift,
sobriety,
personal responsibility.
The key
to self-improvement
among the philosophers
and clergy
was the achievement
of a balance
among the faculties.
For the Whigs,
in politics,
the key to national
transformation
was a balance
between the various
economic interests
of the country
and a sublime faith
that the goals
of farmers
and industrial workers
and merchants
and factory owners
could all be reconciled
into a harmony
of interests,
not unlike
the harmony
of faculties
between moral senses
and intellects
that the moral
philosophers promoted.
unlike the Democrats,
the Whigs
had few qualms
about enlisting
the public aid
of religion
and they did nothing
to discourage
the reputation
they acquired
as the Christian party
in politics.
Whigs saw themselves
as optimists.
They saw themselves
as the party
of opportunity
in a land
which welcomed them
to expansion
and to new horizons.
and they saw no reason
why the federal government
should not assist them
in realizing
those opportunities
and no reason
why the federal government
should not borrow
the assistance
of religion
in promoting
those opportunities
as well
in the public square.
Andrew Jackson's Democrats
on the other hand
saw themselves
very differently.
The Jacksonian Democrats
saw themselves
not optimistically,
they saw themselves
as the victims
of conspiracy
or at least
the potential victims
of conspiracies
that might arise
from any and every corner.
The nostrums
of Whiggish
moral philosophers
and revivalists
like Francis Weyland
or Charles Finney
seemed united
to the Democrats
in their determination
to meddle,
to supervise,
and to control
individual liberty
in the name
of something
they called
lawfulness
and orderliness
but which the Jacksonians
were convinced
was not about
American liberty
at all.
The aim of religion
is to regulate
the conduct of man
with reference
to happiness
in a future
state of being,
declared William Leggett
in his editorials
for the New York
Evening Post
in the 1830s.
The purpose of politics,
said Leggett,
was quite a different affair.
to regulate
his conduct
with reference
to the happiness
of communities.
For that reason,
Leggett,
as a Democrat,
wanted perfect
free trade
in religion.
And that meant
no moral tariffs,
no government
protection,
regulation,
or interference
of any kind
or degree
whatever
on behalf
of religion.
And this extended,
as far as
Leggett was concerned,
even to presidents
declaring
an annual
Thanksgiving Day.
We regret,
said Leggett,
that even this
single exception
should exist
to that rule
of the entire
separation of the
affairs of state
from those
of the church.
So,
for Democrats,
religious moralism
and economic
endeavor
were matters
of private
conclusions
and private
initiative.
And political
virtue was not
to be judged
by an abstract
standard
of moral behavior.
Rather,
political virtue
was to be judged
by whatever
the common voice
of the democracy
called for.
If the popular
majority
preferred to
abolish banks,
as Jackson
virtually did,
to ignore
Indian treaties,
as Jackson
most certainly
did,
and to
sanction
the immoral
high-handedness
of a military
chieftain,
then the
Democratic
conclusion was
that the people
presumably had
every right
to give that
sanction to
those things.
Or if,
in the most
obvious instance,
the common
consent of the
people was in
favor of slavery,
then the Democrats
could only regard
criticism of
slavery,
especially
religious-based
criticism of
slavery,
such as we saw
with the
Edward Zians,
Democrats could
only regard that
with suspicion.
And so the
slave-holding
states of the
Union eventually
found themselves
overwhelmingly
allied to
the Democrats.
And if,
in the next
most obvious
instance,
immigrants liked
their own
religion,
or no religion,
and preferred
that to the
sermons of
Finney or
Weyland,
then immigrants
also would find
themselves overwhelmingly
sympathetic to the
Democratic Party.
As Daniel Walker
Howe has put it,
the Whigs
promoted a society
which would be
economically diverse,
but culturally
uniform.
Democrats
preferred economic
uniformity and
equality,
especially of an
agricultural or
agrarian sort,
but tolerated the
spread of cultural,
ethnic, and
moral diversity.
There was no sense
in which they would
countenance,
as William Leggett
had warned,
the idea of
religion or any
other form of
public virtue being
mandated as the
standard on the
public square.
It would not be
too much to say
that in the
context of the
1830s,
the Whigs
were really the
party of
optimism.
By contrast,
Jackson and
the Democrats
were the party
of anxiety.
Anxiety that the
American Republic
was always about
to be swallowed
up by clergymen,
by moneymen,
or by factorymen.
The world of
the Jacksonian
Democrats,
as it had been
for Jefferson's
Democratic
Republicans,
was a world
that was rimmed
by threat,
not opportunity.
Threat from the
British across
the ocean,
and so we got
the War of 1812,
from creditors
who waved
pieces of paper
that allowed banks
to seize their
land,
which is what
happened to
Jefferson's
Monticello,
and from tax
collectors who
would impoverish
good upstanding
Jeffersonians and
Jacksonians by
extracting revenues
that the government
would use to fund
other people's
success.
The Democrats
wanted to be
left alone,
alone with
their slaves,
alone with
their own
personal constructions
of morality or
religion,
free from the
hectoring of
Whiggish preachers
or moral philosophers,
free from the
possibility that
tomorrow,
or the next
day,
something might
change.
Since from
their position,
change could
only be for
the worse.
Change did
not mean
mobility.
Mobility did
not mean
opportunity.
It meant
instability.
And instability
was what they
feared.
They were
romantics by
nature,
these Jacksonians.
And in fact,
the intellectual
shape given
to the Whigs
by the moral
philosophers
would be
matched among
the Democrats
by the creation
and emergence
of an American
romanticism.
