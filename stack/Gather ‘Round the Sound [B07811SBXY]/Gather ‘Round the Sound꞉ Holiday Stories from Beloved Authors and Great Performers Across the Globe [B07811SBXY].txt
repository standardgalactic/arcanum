Audible Studios presents Gather Round the Sound,
holiday stories from beloved authors and great performers across the globe.
Hello and happy holidays.
I'm Audible narrator on Gelmasters.
2017 has been an exciting and monumental year for us.
We just celebrated our 20th anniversary,
a milestone made possible by you, our wonderful and loyal listeners.
Thank you for being a part of the Audible community.
This year, as our gift to you,
we've pulled together a collection that reflects a little bit of everything we've been up to this past year.
A surprising documentary about letters written to Santa.
A selection of little-known holiday stories.
And even some improvised carols we hope will make you laugh as much as they did us.
Happy holidays, and here's to another great year of listening.
Zip Code 12345
This year, millions of handwritten letters from all over the world will be addressed and mailed to Santa Claus.
Some of those letters, care of Zip Code 12345,
will get rerouted on their way to the North Pole
and end up in an unlikely place,
Schenectady, New York.
So, do you mind telling me your name?
My mom already told you it.
This is Vi.
Vi lives in New York City, in Manhattan.
For Christmas this year, she wants Santa to bring her a beanbag chair, a doll.
A magnifying glass.
Uh-huh.
A fold-up telescope.
A fold-up telescope?
Uh-huh.
And that's it.
Ask any kid where Santa Claus lives,
and they'll all start out with the same answer.
In the North Pole.
Ask them to be more specific,
and they'll start adding shades of their own lives to his whereabouts.
So, if you had to guess the street where Santa lives,
what would you say?
Almost the 100th street.
Did you say 100th street?
Uh-huh.
Which, of course, makes sense.
Vi lives on 79th Street,
Santa lives in the North Pole,
and north means up,
or above,
just like 100th Street is north of 79th.
When kids write letters to Santa Claus,
they can't be bothered by the United States Postal Service.
They address envelopes with whatever makes the most sense.
And when it comes time for a zip code,
they'll often string together the first five numbers they learn.
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
Do you think Santa Claus reads all the letters that kids sent him?
No.
You don't? Why not?
Because he can do everything by himself,
and he has assistance to do it for him.
What do you think they look like?
They're elves.
I think they're small and have pointy ears.
In the late 1960s,
General Electric's headquarters in Schenectady, New York,
registered the zip code 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
At the time, business was good,
correspondence was abundant,
and so it made sense to own the easiest zip code in America.
And now, half a century later,
the company's headquarters has relocated.
What's left is a scaled-down GE campus,
a compound,
desolate,
gray in the winter,
specializes in steam turbines
and generator engineering.
And now add to that image
thousands of letters to Santa Claus,
written by hopeful,
earnest children the world over.
They arrive at GE every year.
It started 22 years ago.
Somebody in the mailroom came and said,
I got this letter from Santa Claus.
What do I do?
And they were going to throw it away.
And I'm like,
you're not throwing it away.
Darlene's not small with pointy ears.
She's not an elf.
Rather, she's a full-grown woman,
the kind who wears holiday-specific sweaters and vests.
She's the mom who likely volunteers to sell baked goods
at her kids' dance recitals.
So we went on the fifth floor into the conference room,
and I grabbed all our finance people,
and we started writing,
and then it just grew and grew.
At first, there were just a few letters.
But the more the GE factory workers responded,
the more letters they would get the next year.
Santa Claus, North Pole,
1-2-3-4-5.
Santa Claus,
1-2-2-5,
Reindeer Way,
Santa's Workshop,
North Pole,
1-2-3-4-5.
Now, the letters start arriving in early November.
This is North Hupoli.
There's an extra P in there.
They come from all over.
California,
some of these elementary school class in South Carolina.
Oh, Georgia.
Like the letters,
Darlene's helpers grew too.
Dozens of GE employees from all over the building
donate their December lunch hours to this cause.
In a fluorescent-lit conference room
full of catered pasta salad and plates of cold cuts,
the GE elves begin to gather.
One of them plays Christmas singles
out of a cell phone speaker.
They each grab a pen and stack of letters
from the many postal bins at the front of the room,
take their seats,
and begin responding.
A makeup set,
Playmobile car and house,
elf pets,
a fish,
paddleboard,
new bedspread,
Tom's...
Kids write letters to Santa Claus
for all sorts of reasons.
Obviously, there's the
here's what I want for Christmas kits.
Leopard iPad case,
a new lunchbox,
money to the poor.
I like that money to the poor slipped in.
Yeah, it's a good ending.
There's the confessional kits,
the ones with something to atone for.
You know, I've been kind of bad.
I've been fighting with my brother or my sister.
If she has some questions
about the naughty or nice list,
she wants to know if it's classified.
I am not to lie,
I was naughty this year.
For instance,
making a Facebook account and stuff,
but hey,
how many kids do you know
that write you a letter
and then own up to not being good?
Pretty rare, I think.
Without meaning to,
kids tell stories in their letters.
Stories about fantasy,
solitude,
change.
This one says,
Dear Santa,
I have been a really good girl this year.
Can I please have a princess,
a crowned,
a real puppy,
and a real baby brother or sister?
Thank you for all of your hard work this year.
Alexa, three years old.
She's thinking Santa Claus for his hard work?
Yeah.
And she gives Dad's house address
It's a mom's house address.
Divorce comes up a lot.
So I'm sending one to each one.
The threat of divorce comes up even more.
Please help my mom and dad not to fight,
and you know,
I don't want to live in two separate houses.
Letters indicate the earliest pangs of self-doubt,
an inevitable dissatisfaction with oneself.
I keep thinking about the one from this year
that cracked me up.
All it said on it when you opened it up
was blonde hair dye.
D-I-Y
and B-L-O-N-D.
And nothing was spelled right.
No dear Santa,
no please do I have it.
It just said blonde hair dye.
How old do you think this person was?
I have a feeling they were probably
like a six-year-old redhead.
Letters allude to dietary restrictions,
physical limitations.
The kids who write,
sometimes someone in their family is really sick.
Dear Santa.
Sometimes they themselves are.
I'm Dani.
My mom is helping me write this letter.
I'm only six and I can't write yet.
This year I would really like some new cars and trucks
and maybe some Legos.
I have a G-tube
and I have to eat from a tube in my tummy.
I can't have cookies,
so I can't leave you any.
Is there something else I can leave?
So at the very beginning,
I'm assuming there were not template letters.
No, there were not template letters.
There was probably like five or six of us.
In the late 1800s,
alone in New Jersey,
Thomas Edison worked obsessively
on inventing new systems of mass communication.
A decade later,
the Thomas Edison General Electric Company
was formed on a sprawling parcel of land
in Schenectady, New York.
And there the company grew,
helping define America's relationship
to manufacturing,
to mass production.
A hundred years go by,
and when the GE factory workers
started responding to kids' letters
to Santa Claus,
they would write each response by hand.
I remember that some of them
didn't believe in Santa,
and we would write to them,
if you don't believe,
you won't receive.
And so, like Edison before them,
they streamlined the process.
Templates were created.
I mean, now we're getting
an abundance of them,
so we have to keep it under control.
Dear so-and-so,
my elves have been very busy
in their workshop,
and the sleigh is all ready to go.
Generic and friendly letters
about the spirit of Christmas,
why it's important to behave.
You have been good this year,
and I'm very happy.
Keep the true spirit of Christmas
in your heart,
helping others.
And please remember to leave me
some milk and cookies.
I get hungry on my long journey.
Elves keep a stack of template responses
at their stations,
needing only to write in
each child's name at the top.
A manufacturing process,
step-by-step,
hand-to-hand,
until the final product
is constructed.
Dear Santa,
I've been a good girl all year.
But then,
a kid's personality,
brazen and uncensored,
will throw a wrench
into the elves' assembly line.
I promise to stop farting
at the dinner table.
It's a girl, too.
That's hilarious.
And then there's
a different kind of letter,
hundreds of them.
They sit in a box
beneath a table
in the corner
of the conference room
with a sign on it
that says,
For Adoption.
Have you ever sent anything
besides a letter
back to a family?
Years ago,
we used to send
a lot of stuff.
Aubrey,
remember when Terry
sent the family a ham?
Everybody would team up
and buy stuff,
and then we'd send it off.
And where would that money
come from?
Just your pockets?
Right.
Right.
Everybody would go buy,
you know,
we'd all chip in.
For many,
Christmas is about
getting what's wanted.
But for some,
Christmas is about
getting what's needed.
Hi, my name is Kara,
and all I really want
for Christmas
is new glasses
and braces.
And you figure,
you know,
because the parents
don't have good health care,
that's why she doesn't
have those things,
right?
Oh, my goodness.
I remembered somebody
sent me their heating bill.
Wait, was it addressed
to Santa Claus?
Yes.
I called them,
and I said,
why are you sending me
your heating bill?
And I'm like,
I'm sorry,
we're not paying for it.
We can't.
The letters in the box
beneath the table
are frantic,
pleading,
their fingers reaching
for a kind of magic
that the writers
themselves know
doesn't exist.
But we kind of
had to stop.
We weren't sure
if people were really
in need.
We have to keep it
under control.
The authenticity
of need comes up
a lot among the elves.
And it's tempting
to hold this skepticism
against them,
but once each
sad letter is opened,
read,
and placed in the
adoption box
with the rest,
it's easy to see
why they might
numb the reader,
why they stop seeming
like autonomous tragedies.
One big pile of sad,
out of sight,
out of mind.
I am nine years old.
I am in fourth grade.
I have been really
good this year.
My mom is a single mom
with two daughters.
My dad just left us alone,
so it is not easy
for my mom to provide us
everything that we need.
Sometimes she doesn't
have money to pay the rent,
so she don't have money
to buy things for Christmas.
Some things that we really
need are clothes
and boots for the winter.
And then she lists
her sizes.
The letters start
to bleed into one another,
each of them including
the clothing and shoe sizes
of siblings and parents,
a rundown of what ails them.
Sure, the letters are a list
of what the writer wants,
but in between the lines,
there's a list of what
the writer doesn't have,
what they've never had.
Dear Santa,
I am nine years old.
There are three of us,
little brother, mom, and me,
living in a room
that is rented.
We need some toys
for my baby brother,
so can I have a box
of Pampers size
three or nine months?
I went through the adoption box
with my friend Olivia.
We sat on the floor,
almost crouched beneath
a table where the box
was kept.
Whenever an elf walked by,
we would try making
ourselves smaller,
almost apologetically,
because we knew,
as visitors to this
unlikely Santa's workshop,
that these letters
were kept hidden
for a reason.
We didn't want to
disrupt the spirited Christmas
filling up the rest
of the GE conference room.
Aw, this one wants
an elf too.
A room determined
to focus on a kind
of magic that does exist.
This year,
I only want one thing.
American Girl doll.
It's cute.
And she's got
this Q number.
Anything interesting?
No, this one wants
hillbilly CDs.
What does that mean?
I have no idea.
Never heard of it before.
What's the furthest away
you get letters from?
We get letters from China.
You get letters from China?
China and Taiwan,
and we have Rita.
Who answers them back?
Rita sits in the center
of the conference room,
surrounded by other elves.
Does she speak Mandarin?
Yes.
So this one is so easy.
It says,
Dear Santa Claus,
thank you for being
so nice to the children
of the world.
Love you.
He didn't even ask
for anything.
American children
are taught to receive gifts.
For Christmas,
for birthdays,
to mark high performances
in a classroom,
or in sports.
They learn that good behavior
is rewarded.
To them,
Santa and presents
are inextricably linked.
He's just a dressed-up
delivery man.
But not in China.
There,
Santa Claus is synonymous
with good behavior,
and it doesn't come
with a reward.
This one says,
Dear Santa Claus,
my name is Kara Hui.
This year,
I have been a good girl
that I should still be
on the nice kid list.
Santa,
some things that I might like
for this Christmas are
the world be peaceful.
I love this because
they're only telling you
that they're good
so you know.
They're not saying
I've been good
so you can give them
a present.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Most of the time
they just wish
the world peaceful
or their family health
and they get good
score from school.
While I was standing
with her,
watching her beam
at every selfless,
earnest letter
from China,
a neighboring elf
happened on a letter
to Santa written
by Rita's son.
He says,
Dear Santa,
I have been good
and on the nice list.
What I want for Christmas
is a motorbike,
a phone,
an iPod,
and a million of dollars.
Thank you, Santa.
A million of dollars.
Rita.
He wants a million dollars?
Yeah.
The first between
the kids in the U.S.
and China.
The kids in the U.S.
asked for everything,
even money.
Just before leaving GE,
I asked Darlene
if she would take me
to her desk.
Sure.
Sure can.
Turned out to be
two elevators
and many hallways away.
I know.
Each floor of the campus
blends in with
the one before it.
Rows of nondescript cubicles,
so many of them vacated.
Even the occupied ones
are just a computer
and hung up coat.
I remember thinking,
this is the kind of place
where people work
for the weekend.
Oh, so we did get
some more letters.
Until we arrive
to Darlene's desk.
They usually bring them.
Darlene is an
administrative assistant
for renewables
and commercial operations.
But her desk
says otherwise.
She's been at GE
for 25 years now,
about half her life.
And while so much
of that time
is spent doing
the same things
over and over,
Decembers are different.
Her cubicle walls
are lined
with her favorite
letters to Santa.
In the winter,
boxes of unanswered letters
are dropped off
at her desk,
which she then
hauls onto a rolling cart
and marches down
to the elves' workshop
at lunchtime.
Usually bring them
to me before lunch.
25 years ago,
Darlene became Santa
through an unlikely quirk
of the U.S. Postal Service
and the simplicity
of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
And at first glance,
this GE campus,
a shell of his former self
and firmly holding on
to its history
of mass production,
seems like oblique destination
for a child's letter
to Santa Claus.
But at Darlene's desk
and in her Christmas
conference room,
no one's working
for the weekend.
They're working
for December.
It says,
Dear Santa,
just to let you know,
we are Jewish,
but would love
to have you come
and you can still come.
Love, Ella.
Do you leave milk
and cookies out for Santa?
Or maybe a beer?
Here's a twist
on a holiday classic
from Down Under.
An Aussie Night
Before Christmas
Written by Yvonne Morrison
T'was the night
before Christmas.
There wasn't a sound.
Not a possum was stirring.
No one was around.
We'd left on the table
some tucker and beer,
hoping that Santa Claus
soon would be here.
We children were snuggled up
safe in our beds
while dreams of pavlova
and pavlova danced round
in our heads.
And mum in her nightie
and dad in his shorts
had just settled down
to watch TV sports.
When outside the house
a mad ruckus arose,
loud squeaking and banging
woke us from our doze.
We ran to the screen door,
peeked cautiously out,
snuck onto the deck,
then let out a shout.
Guess what had woken us
up from our snooze?
But a rusty old ute
pulled by eight mighty roos.
The cheerful man driving
was giggling with glee.
And we both knew at once
who this plump bloke must be.
Now, I'm telling the truth,
it's all dinky dye.
Those eight kangaroos
fairly soared through the sky.
Santa leaned out the window
to pull at the reins
and encouraged the roos
by calling their names.
Now Kylie, now Kirstie,
now Shazza and Shane.
On Kipper, on Skipper,
on Baza and Wayne.
Park up on that water tank,
grab a quick drink.
I'll scoot down the gum tree,
be back in a wink.
So up to the tank
those eight kangaroos flew
with a ute full of toys
and Santa Claus too.
He slid down the gum tree
and jumped to the ground.
And then in through the window
he sprang with a bound.
He had bright sunburned cheeks
and a milky white beard.
A jolly old joker
was how he appeared.
He wore red stubby shorts
and old thongs on his feet.
And it had a deep crimson
a shade from the heat.
His eyes bright as opals.
Oh, how they twinkled.
And like a goanna,
his skin was quite wrinkled.
His shirt was stretched over
a round bulging belly,
which shook when he moved
like a plate full of jelly.
A fat sack of prezzies
he flung from his back
and he looked like a swaggy
unfastening his pack.
He spoke not a word,
but bent down on one knee
to position our goodies
beneath the yule tree.
Surfboard and footy ball
shapes for us two
and for dad tongs to use
on the new barbecue.
A mysterious package
he left for our mum.
Then he turned and he winked
and he held up his thumb.
He strolled out on deck
and his ruse came on cue,
flung his sack in the back
and prepared to shoot through.
He bellowed out loud
as they swooped past the gates.
Merry Christmas to all
and good on you, mates!
You never know
who might knock at your door
during the holidays.
It could be carolers.
It could be your neighbors
or family.
Or it could be a king
in disguise.
The music coming from the house
by Paolo Coelho
On Christmas Eve,
the king invited the prime minister
to join him
for their usual walk together.
He enjoyed seeing
the decorations in the streets,
but since he didn't want
his subjects to spend
too much money on these
just to please him,
the two men always disguised
themselves as traders
from some far distant land.
They walked through
the centre of the city
admiring the lights,
the Christmas trees,
the candles burning
on the steps of the houses,
the stalls selling gifts,
and the men, women and children
hurrying off to celebrate
a family Christmas
around a table laden with food.
On the way back,
they passed through
a poorer area
where the atmosphere
was quite different.
There were no lights,
no candles,
no delicious smells
of food about to be served.
There was hardly a soul
in the street,
and as he did every year,
the king remarked
to the prime minister
that he really must
pay more attention
to the poor in his kingdom.
The prime minister nodded,
knowing that the matter
would soon be forgotten again,
buried beneath
the day-to-day bureaucracy
of budgets
to be approved
and discussions
with foreign dignitaries.
Suddenly they heard music
coming from one
of the poorest houses.
The hut was so ramshackle
and the rotten wooden timbers
so full of cracks
that they were able
to peer through
and see what was happening inside.
And what they saw
was utterly absurd.
An old man
in a wheelchair
apparently crying,
a shaven-headed
young woman dancing,
and a young man
with sad eyes
shaking a tambourine
and singing a folk song.
I'm going to find out
what they're up to,
said the king.
He knocked,
the music stopped,
and the young man
came to the door.
We are merchants
in search of a place
to sleep.
We heard the music,
saw that you were
still awake,
and wondered if we could
spend the night here.
You can find shelter
in a hotel in the city.
We, alas,
cannot help you.
Despite the music,
this house is full
of sadness
and suffering.
And may we know why?
It's all because of me.
It was the old man
in the wheelchair
who spoke.
I have spent my life
teaching my son
calligraphy,
so that he could
one day
get a job
as a palace scribe.
But the years have passed,
and no post
has ever come up.
And then last night
I had a stupid dream.
An angel
appeared to me
and asked me
to buy a silver goblet,
because the angel said
the king would be
coming to visit me.
He would drink
from the goblet
and give my son
a job.
The angel
was so persuasive
that I decided
to do as he said.
Since we have
no money,
my daughter-in-law
went to the market
this morning
to sell her hair,
so that we could
buy that goblet
over there.
The two of them
are doing their best
to get me
in the Christmas spirit
by singing and dancing,
but it's no use.
The king saw
the silver goblet,
asked to be given
a little water
to quench his thirst,
and before leaving
said to the family,
Do you know,
we were talking
to the prime minister
only today,
and he told us
that an opening
for a palace scribe
would be announced
next week.
The old man nodded,
not really believing
what he was hearing,
and bade farewell
to the strangers.
The following morning,
however,
a royal proclamation
was read out
in all the city streets.
A new scribe
was needed at court.
On the appointed day,
the audience room
at the palace
was packed with people
eager to compete
for that much-sought-after post.
The prime minister
entered and asked
everyone there
to prepare
their pens and paper.
Here is the subject
of the composition.
Why is an old man weeping,
a shaven-headed woman dancing,
and a sad young man singing?
A murmur of disbelief
went around the room.
No one knew
how to tell such a story,
apart, that is,
from the shabbily-dressed
young man
sitting in one corner
who smiled broadly
and began to write.
Based on an Indian story
For lovers of literature
like us,
no author invokes
the holiday spirit
quite like Charles Dickens.
We dug up a story of his
you may not know.
It was originally published
in the Christmas edition
of a Victorian periodical.
And don't worry,
there are still ghosts.
The Signalman
by Charles Dickens
Hello! Below there!
When he heard a voice
thus calling to him,
he was standing
at the door of his box
with a flag in his hand
furled round its short pole.
One would have thought,
considering the nature
of the ground,
that he could not have doubted
from what quarter
the voice came.
But instead of looking up
to where I stood
on the top of the steep
cutting nearly over his head,
he turned himself about
and looked down the line.
There was something remarkable
in his manner of doing so,
though I could not have said
for my life
what.
But I know it was remarkable enough
to attract my notice,
even though his figure
was foreshortened
and shadowed
down in the deep trench
and mine was high above him,
so steeped in the glow
of an angry sunset
that I had shaded my eyes
with my hand
before I saw him at all.
Hello!
Hello there!
From looking down the line,
he turned himself about again
and, raising his eyes,
saw my figure high above him.
Is there any path
by which I can come down
and speak to you?
He looked up at me
without replying,
and I looked down at him
without pressing him
too soon with the repetition
of my idle question.
Just then,
there came a vague vibration
in the earth and air,
quickly changing
into a violent pulsation
and an oncoming rush
that caused me to start back
as though it had forced
to draw me down.
When such vapor as rose
to my height
from this rapid train
had passed me
and was skimming away
over the landscape,
I looked down again
and saw him refurling
the flag he had shown
while the train went by.
I repeated my inquiry.
After a pause,
during which he seemed
to regard me
with fixed attention,
he motioned
with his rolled-up flag
towards a point
on my level
some two or three hundred yards
distant.
I called down to him,
All right!
and made for that point.
There,
by dint of looking
closely about me,
I found a rough,
zigzag descending path
notched out,
which I followed.
The cutting was extremely deep
and unusually precipitated.
It was made
through a clammy stone
that became
oozier and wetter
as I went down.
For these reasons,
I found the way
long enough
to give me time
to recall
a singular air
of reluctance
or compulsion
with which he had
pointed out the path.
When I came down
low enough
upon the zigzag descent
to see him again,
I saw that he was
standing between the rails
on the way
by which the train
had lately passed
in an attitude
as if he were waiting
for me to appear.
He had his left hand
at his chin
and that left elbow
rested on his right hand
crossed over his breast.
His attitude
was one of such
expectation
and watchfulness
that I stopped a moment
wondering at it.
I resumed
my downward way
and stepping out
upon the level
of the railroad
and drawing nearer
to him,
saw that he was
a dark, sallow man
with a dark beard
and rather heavy eyebrows.
His post was
in as solitary
and dismal a place
as ever I saw.
On either side,
a dripping wet wall
of jagged stone
excluding all view
but a strip of sky.
The perspective
one way,
only a crooked
prolongation
of this great dungeon,
the shorter perspective
in the other direction
terminating in a gloomy
red light
and the gloomier entrance
to a black tunnel
in whose massive architecture
there was a barbarous,
depressing,
and forbidding air.
So little sunlight
never found its way
to this spot
that it had an earthy,
deadly smell
and so much cold wind
rushed through it
that it struck
chill to me
as if I had left
the natural world.
Before he stirred,
I was near enough
to him
to have touched him.
Not even then
removing his eyes
from mine,
he stepped back
one step
and lifted his hand.
This is a lonesome spot
to occupy.
It had riveted
my attention
when I looked down
from up yonder.
A visitor is a rarity,
I should suppose.
In me,
he merely saw a man
who had been shut up
within narrow limits
all his life
and who,
being at last set free,
had a newly awakened interest
in these great works.
For such purpose,
I spoke to him.
But I am far from sure
of the terms I used,
for besides that
I am not happy
in opening any conversation,
there was something
in the man
that daunted me.
He directed
a most curious look
towards the red
light near the tunnel's mouth
and looked all about it
as if something
were missing from it
and then looked at me.
That light
is part of your charge,
is it not?
Don't you know it is?
The monstrous thought
came into my mind
as I perused
the fixed eyes
and the saturnine face
that this was a spirit,
not a man.
I have speculated since
whether there may have been
infection in his mind.
In my turn,
I stepped back.
But in making the action,
I detected in his eyes
some latent fear of me.
This put the monstrous
thought to flight.
You look at me
as if you had a dread of me.
I was doubtful
whether I had seen you
before.
Where?
He pointed to the red light
he had looked at.
There?
Intently watchful of me,
he replied,
but without sound.
Yes.
My good fellow,
what should I do there?
However,
be that as it may,
I never was there,
you may swear.
I think I may.
Yes,
I'm sure I may.
His manner cleared
like my own.
He replied to my remarks
with readiness
and in well-chosen words.
Had he much to do there?
Yes,
that was to say,
he had enough responsibility
to bear.
But exactness and watchfulness
were what was required of him,
and of actual work,
manual labour,
he had next to none.
To change that signal,
to trim those lights,
and to turn this iron handle,
now and then,
was all he had to do
under that head.
Regarding those many
long and lonely hours
of which I seem to make so much,
he could only say
that the routine of his life
had shaped itself
into that form
and he had grown used to it.
He had taught himself
a language down here,
if only to know it by sight
and to have formed
his own crude ideas
of its pronunciation
could be called learning it.
He had also worked
at fractions and decimals
and tried a little algebra,
but he was
and had been as a boy
a poor hand at figures.
Was it necessary for him
when on duty
always to remain
in that channel of damp air,
and could he never rise
into the sunshine
from between
those high stone walls?
Why, that depended
upon times and circumstances.
Under some conditions
there would be less
upon the line
than under others,
and the same held good
as to certain hours
of the day and night.
In bright weather
he did choose occasions
for getting a little above
these lower shadows.
But being at all times
liable to be called
by his electric bell,
and at such times
listening for it
with redoubled anxiety,
the relief was less
than I would suppose.
He took me into his box
where there was a fire,
a desk for an official book
in which he had
to make certain entries,
a telegraphic instrument
with its dial face
and needles,
and the little bell
of which he had spoken.
On my trusting
that he would excuse
the remark
that he had been
well-educated,
and I hoped I might say
without offence
perhaps educated
above that station,
he observed that instances
of slight incongruity
in such wise
would rarely be found
wanting among large bodies
of men,
that he had heard
it was so in workhouses,
in the police force,
even in that last
desperate resource,
the army,
and that he knew
it was so,
more or less,
in any great railway staff.
He had been,
when young,
if I could believe it,
sitting in that hut,
he scarcely could,
a student of natural philosophy,
and had attended lectures,
but he had run wild,
misused his opportunities,
gone down,
and never risen again.
He had no complaint
to offer about that.
He had made his bed,
and he lay upon it.
It was far too late
to make another.
All that I have here condensed,
he said in a quiet manner,
with his grave,
dark regards
divided between me
and the fire.
He threw in the word
sir from time to time,
and especially when
he referred to his youth,
as though to request me
to understand
that he claimed
to be nothing
but what I found him.
He was several times
interrupted
by the little bell,
and had to read off messages
and send replies.
Once he had to stand
without the door,
and display a flag
as a train passed,
and make some verbal communication
to the driver.
In the discharge of his duties
I observed him
to be remarkably exact
and vigilant,
breaking off his discourse
at a syllable,
and remaining silent
until what he had to do
was done.
In a word,
I should have set
this man down
as one of the safest
of men to be employed
in that capacity,
but for the circumstance
that while he was speaking
to me,
he twice broke off
with a fallen colour,
turned his face
towards the little bell
when it did not ring,
opened the door
of the hut,
which was kept shut
to exclude the unhealthy dab,
and looked out
towards the red light
near the mouth
of the tunnel.
On both of these occasions,
he came back
to the fire
with the inexplicable air
upon him
which I had remarked
without being able
to define
when we were so far
asunder.
I rose to leave him
and said,
You almost make me think
that I have met
with a contented man.
I am afraid
I must acknowledge
that I said it
to lead him on.
I believe
I used to be so,
but I am troubled, sir.
I am troubled.
He would have recalled
the words if he could.
He had said them, however,
and I took them up quickly.
With what?
What is your trouble?
It is very difficult
to impart, sir.
It is very, very difficult
to speak of.
If ever you make me
another visit,
I will try to tell you.
But I expressly intend
to make you another visit.
Say, when shall it be?
I go off
early in the morning
and I shall be on again
at ten
tomorrow night, sir.
I will come at eleven.
He thanked me
and went out
at the door with me.
I'll show my white light, sir,
till you have found
the way up.
When you have found it,
don't call out.
And when you are at the top,
don't call out.
His manner seemed
to make the place
strike colder to me,
but I said no more than
very well.
And when you come down
tomorrow night,
don't call out.
Let me ask you
a parting question.
What made you cry
hello below there
tonight?
Heaven knows.
I cried something
to that effect.
Not to that effect, sir.
Those were the very words.
I know them well.
I admit those
were the very words.
I said them,
no doubt,
because I saw you below.
For no other reason.
What other reason
could I possibly have?
You had no feeling
that they were
conveyed to you
in any
supernatural way.
No.
He wished me good night
and held up his light.
I walked by the side
of the down line
of rails
with a very disagreeable
sensation of a train
coming behind me
until I found the path.
It was easier to mount
than to descend
and I got back to my inn
without any adventure.
Punctual to my appointment,
I placed my foot
on the first notch
of the zigzag
next night
as the distant clocks
were striking eleven.
He was waiting for me
at the bottom
with his white light on.
I have not yet called out.
May I speak now?
By all means, sir.
Good night, then.
And here's my hand.
Good night, sir.
And here's mine.
With that,
we walked side by side
to his box,
entered it,
closed the door,
and sat down by the fire.
I have made up my mind, sir,
that you shall not have
to ask me twice
what troubles me.
I took you
for someone else
yesterday evening.
That troubles me.
That mistake?
No.
That someone else.
Who is it?
I don't know.
Like me?
I don't know.
I never saw the face.
The left arm
is across the face
and the right arm
is waved.
Violently waved.
This way.
I followed his action
with my eyes
and it was the action
of an arm gesticulating
with the utmost passion
and vehemence.
For God's sake,
clear the way.
One moonlight night,
I was sitting here
when I heard a voice cry
hello below there.
I started up,
looked from that door,
and saw this
someone else
standing by the red light
near the tunnel,
waving as I just now
showed you.
The voice
seemed hoarse
with shouting
and it cried,
Look out!
Look out!
And then again,
Hello!
Below there!
Look out!
I caught up my lamp,
turned it on red,
and ran towards
the figure,
calling,
What's wrong?
What has happened?
Where?
It stood
just outside
the blackness
of the tunnel.
I advanced
so close upon it
that I wondered
at its keeping
the sleeve
across its eyes.
I ran right up at it
and had my hand
stretched out
to pull the sleeve away
when it was gone.
Into the tunnel?
No.
I ran on
into the tunnel
five hundred yards.
I stopped
and held my lamp
above my head
and saw the figures
of the measured distance
and saw the wet stains
stealing down the walls
and trickling
through the arch.
I ran out again,
faster than I had run in,
for I had a mortal
abhorrence
of the place upon me,
and I looked all round
the red light
with my own red light.
I went up the iron ladder
to the gallery
atop of it,
and I came down again
and ran back here.
I telegraphed
both ways.
An alarm has been given.
Is anything wrong?
The answer came back
both ways.
All well.
Resisting the slow touch
of a frozen finger
tracing out my spine,
I showed him
how that this figure
must be a deception
of his sense of sight,
and how that figures
originating in disease
of the delicate nerves
that minister
to the functions
of the eye
were known
to have often
troubled patients,
some of whom
had become conscious
of the nature
of their affliction
and had even proved it
by experiments
upon themselves.
As to an imaginary cry,
do but listen
for a moment
to the wind
in this unnatural valley
while we speak so low,
and to the wild harp
it makes
of the telegraph wires.
That was all very well,
he returned,
after we had sat
listening for a while,
and he ought to know
something of the wind
and the wires,
he who so often
passed long winter nights
there alone and watching,
that he would beg
to remark that he had
not finished.
I asked his pardon,
and he slowly added
these words,
touching my arm.
Within six hours
after the appearance,
the memorable accident
on this line happened,
and within ten hours,
the dead and wounded
were brought along
through the tunnel,
over the spot
where the figure
had stood.
A disagreeable shudder
crept over me,
but I did my best
against it.
It was not to be denied,
I rejoined,
that this was
a remarkable coincidence
calculated deeply
to impress his mind.
But it was unquestionable
that remarkable coincidences
did continually occur,
and they must be taken
into account
in dealing with
such a subject.
Though to be sure,
I must admit,
I added,
for I thought I saw
that he was going
to bring the objection
to bear upon me.
Men of common sense
did not allow much
for coincidences
in making the ordinary
calculations of life.
He again begged to remark
that he had not finished.
I again begged his pardon
for being betrayed
into interruptions.
He laid his hand
upon my arm,
glancing over his shoulder
with hollow eyes.
This was just a year ago.
Six or seven months passed,
and I'd recovered
from the surprise
and shock
when one morning,
as the day was breaking,
I,
standing at that door,
looked towards
the red light
and saw the spectre again.
He stopped
with a fixed look at me.
Did it cry out?
No.
It was silent.
Did it wave its arm?
No.
It leaned against
the shaft of light
with both hands
before the face,
like this.
Once more,
I followed his action
with my eyes.
It was an action
of mourning.
I have seen such an attitude
in stone figures
on tombs.
Did you go up to it?
I came in
and sat down,
partly to collect
my thoughts,
partly because
it had turned me faint.
When I went
to the door again,
daylight was above me
and the ghost
was gone.
But nothing followed?
Nothing came of this?
He touched me
on the arm
with his forefinger
twice or thrice,
giving a ghastly nod
each time.
That very day,
as a train
came out of the tunnel,
I noticed,
at a carriage window
on my side,
what looked like
a confusion
of hands
and heads
and something
waved.
I saw it
just in time
to signal the driver,
stop!
He shut off
and put his brake on,
but the train
drifted past here
a hundred and fifty
yards or more.
I ran after it
and as I went along,
heard terrible screams
and cries.
The beautiful young lady
had died instantaneously
in one of the compartments
and was brought
in here
and laid down
on this floor
between us.
Involuntarily,
I pushed my chair back
as I looked
from the boards
at which he pointed
to himself.
True, sir.
Precisely as it happened,
so I tell it to you.
I could think of nothing
to say to any purpose,
and my mouth
was very dry.
The wind and the wires
took up the story
with a long,
lamenting wail.
He resumed.
Now, sir,
mark this
and judge
how my mind
is troubled.
The spectre
came back
a week ago.
Ever since,
it has been there
now and again
by fits and starts.
At the light?
At the danger light.
What does it seem to do?
He repeated,
if possible,
with increased passion
and vehemence
that former gesticulation
of,
for God's sake,
clear the way.
Then he went on.
I have no peace
or rest for it.
It calls to me
for many minutes together
in an agonized manner.
Below there,
look out,
look out.
It stands,
waving to me.
It rings my little bell.
Did it ring your bell
yesterday evening
when I was here
and you went to the door?
Twice.
Why,
see how your imagination
misleads you.
My eyes were on the bell
and my ears were open
to the bell
and if I am a living man
it did not ring
at those times.
No,
nor at any other time
except when it was rung
in the natural course
of physical things
by the station
communicating with you.
He shook his head.
I have never made a mistake
as to that yet, sir.
I have never confused
the specter's ring
with the man's.
The ghost's ring
is a strange vibration
in the bell
that it derives
from nothing else
and I have not asserted
that the bell
stirs to the eye.
I don't wonder
that you failed
to hear it
but I heard it.
And did the specter
seem to be there
when you looked out?
It was there.
Both times?
Both times.
Will you come
to the door with me
and look for it now?
He bit his underlip
as though he was
somewhat unwilling
but arose.
I opened the door
and stood on the step
while he stood
in the doorway.
There was the danger light.
There was the dismal
mouth of the tunnel.
There were the high
wet stone walls
of the cutting.
There were the stars
above them.
Do you see it?
I took particular note
of his face.
His eyes were prominent
and strained
but not very much more so
perhaps than my own
had been
when I had directed them
earnestly towards
the same spot.
No.
It is not there.
Agreed.
We went in again,
shut the door
and resumed our seats.
I was thinking
how best to improve
this advantage
if it might be called one
when he took up
the conversation
in such a matter-of-course way
so assuming that
there could be
no serious question
of fact between us
that I felt myself
placed in the weakest
of positions.
By this time
you will fully understand,
sir,
that what troubles me
so dreadfully
is the question
what does the specter
mean?
I was not sure
I told him
that I did
fully understand.
He ruminated
with his eyes
on the fire
and only by times
turning them on me.
What is its warning
against?
What is the danger?
Where is the danger?
There is danger
overhanging somewhere
on the line.
Some dreadful calamity
will happen.
It is not to be doubted
this third time
after what has gone before
but surely
this is a cruel
haunting of me.
What can I do?
He pulled out
his handkerchief
and wiped the drops
from his heated forehead.
If I telegraph danger
on either side of me
or on both
I can give no reason
for it.
I should get into trouble
and do no good.
They would think
I was mad.
This is the way
it would work.
Message.
Danger.
Take care.
Answer.
What danger?
Where?
Message.
Don't know
but for God's sake
take care.
They would displace me.
What else could they do?
His pain of mind
was most pitiable
to see.
It was the mental torture
of a conscientious man
oppressed beyond endurance
by an unintelligible
responsibility
involving life.
He continued
putting his dark hair
back from his head
and drawing his hands
outwards
across and across
his temples
in an extremity
of feverish distress.
When it first
stood under
the danger light
why not tell me
where that accident
was to happen
if it must happen?
Why not tell me
how it could be averted
if it could have been averted?
Where none
at second coming
it hid its face
why not tell me instead
she is going to die?
Let them keep her at home.
If it came
on those two occasions
only to show me
that its warnings
were true
and so to prepare me
for the third
why not warn me
plainly now?
And I
Lord help me
a mere poor signalman
on this solitary station
why not go to somebody
with credit
to be believed
and power
to act?
When I saw him
in this state
I saw that
for the poor man's sake
as well as
for the public safety
what I had to do
for the time
was to compose
his mind.
Therefore
setting aside
all question
of reality
or unreality
between us
I represented
to him
that whoever
thoroughly discharged
his duty
must do well
and that at least
it was his comfort
that he understood
his duty
though he did not
understand
these confounding
appearances.
In this effort
I succeeded
far better
than in the attempt
to reason him
out of his conviction.
He became calm.
The occupations
incidental to his post
as the night advanced
began to make
larger demands
on his attention
and I left him
at two in the morning.
I had offered
to stay through
the night
but he would not
hear of it.
That I more than once
looked back
at the red light
as I ascended
the pathway
that I did not
like the red light
and that I should
have slept
but poorly
if my bed
had been under it
I see no reason
to conceal
nor did I like
the two sequences
of the accident
and the dead girl.
I see no reason
to conceal
that either.
But what ran
most in my thoughts
was the consideration
how ought I to act
having become
the recipient
of this disclosure.
I had proved
the man
to be intelligent
vigilant
painstaking
and exact
but how long
might he remain so
in his state of mind.
Though in a
subordinate position
still he held
a most important trust
and would I
for instance
like to stake
my own life
on the chances
of his continuing
to execute it
with precision?
Unable to overcome
a feeling
that there would be
something treacherous
in my communicating
what he had told me
to his superiors
in the company
without first being
plain with himself
and proposing
a middle course to him
I ultimately resolved
to offer
to accompany him
otherwise keeping
his secret
for the present
to the wisest
medical practitioner
we could hear of
in those parts
and to take
his opinion
a change
in his time
of duty
would come round
next night
he had apprised me
and he would be
off an hour or two
after sunrise
and on again
soon after sunset
I had appointed
to return
accordingly
Next evening
was a lovely evening
and I walked out
early to enjoy it
the sun was not
yet quite down
when I traversed
the field path
near the top
of the deep cutting
I would extend
my walk for an hour
I said to myself
half an hour on
and half an hour back
and it would then
be time to go
to my signalman's box
Before pursuing
my stroll
I stepped to the brink
and mechanically
looked down
from the point
from which
I had first seen him
I cannot describe
the thrill
that seized upon me
when close
at the mouth
of the tunnel
I saw the appearance
of a man
with his left sleeve
across his eyes
passionately waving
his right arm
The nameless horror
that oppressed me
passed in a moment
for in a moment
I saw that this appearance
of a man
was a man indeed
and that there was
a little group
of other men
standing at a short distance
to whom he seemed
to be rehearsing
the gesture he made
The danger light
was not yet lighted
Against its shaft
a little low hut
entirely new to me
had been made
of some wooden supports
and tarpaulin
It looked no bigger
than a bed
With an irresistible sense
that something was wrong
With a flashing
self-reproachful fear
that fatal mischief
had come
of my leaving the man there
and causing no one
to be sent
to overlook
or correct
what he did
I descended
the notched path
with all the speed
I could make
What is the matter?
Signalman killed
this morning, sir
Not the man
belonging to that box
Yes, sir
Not the man
I know
You will recognise him, sir
if you knew him
for his face
is quite composed
He solemnly
uncovered his own head
and raised
an end of the tarpaulin
Oh!
How did this happen?
He was
cut down
by an engine, sir
No man in England
knew his work better
but somehow
he was not clear
of the outer rail
It was just
a broad day
He had struck the light
and had the lamp
in his hand
As the engine
came out the tunnel
his back was towards her
and she cut him down
That man drove her
and was showing
how it happened
Show the gentleman, Tom
The man who wore
a rough, dark dress
stepped back
to his former place
at the mouth
of the tunnel
Coming round the curve
in the tunnel, sir
I saw him at the end
like as if I saw him
down a perspective glass
There was no time
to check speed
and I knew him
to be very careful
As he didn't seem
to take heed
of the whistle
I shut it off
when we were
running down upon him
and called to him
as loud as I could call
What did you say?
I said
Below there!
Look out!
For God's sake!
Clear the way!
I started
Oh, it was a dreadful time, sir
I never left off
calling to him
I put this arm
before my eyes
not to see
and I waved this arm
to the last
But it was no use
Without prolonging
the narrative
to dwell on any one
of its curious circumstances
more than on any other
I may, in closing it
point out the coincidence
that the warning
of the engine driver
included
not only the words
which the unfortunate signalman
had repeated to me
as haunting him
but also the words
which I myself
not he
had attached
and that only
in my own mind
to the gesticulation
he had imitated
And finally,
what would the holidays
be without some carols?
Vern, a New York City-based
improv troupe presents
A Very Improvised
Holiday Musical
One cold, lonely night
in December
a party is happening
in New York City
and it's
going kind of badly
I officiated the wedding
Wow, I can't believe
Tony winner
and Broadway sensation
Laura Benanti
invited me
to her holiday party
I don't know
Laura Benanti
Hey, thank you so much
for inviting me
to your holiday party
Laura
You're welcome
Are you enjoying it okay?
Yeah
I love parties
Okay, cool
Honestly, I almost
didn't have it this year
Why not?
I don't know
It just always feels like
no one's having fun
And anyway
I think I might just
be over the holidays
What?
Yeah, I just
I have this stuff
in my closet
so it's easy
to throw up
a bunch of mistletoe
and glitter
in my holiday cookies
and call it a party
but I wouldn't do it
if I didn't have
to make my relatives
and friends happy
Like, no offense
I just want to zone out
on my phone
in the corner
like half the people
here are doing
but I'm the host
so
Hey!
We, um
just happened to be
walking down the street
Oh my god, Laura
So happy to meet you
Thank you for inviting us
Yeah, who are you?
We're friends of Mikey
Uh, I heard your party
was terrible
What?
That's not what I said
It does feel like
no one's having fun
I don't know if it's
that I'm just sick
of the holidays
or I'd rather be
scrolling the internet
right now
like somewhere deep
in cutecatland.com
To be fair
cutecatland.com
is like so good
Thank you
Uh, well
look at this right meow
Here you go
Guys, what is that?
Nothing?
It's The Cure
Wow
It's an album
A very improvised
holiday musical
with Vern
Who's Vern?
It's us!
Guys!
It's this really cool
group of undiscovered
artists trying to make
the world a better place
through comedy
and also like
what is undiscovered?
You know
I feel like we have
Just put it on
I think it'll make
you feel better
I think it'll
revitalize your attitude
towards the holidays

Oh wow! Thank you all so much for being here. We are Vern.
Vern!
And happy holidays. We are so grateful that you decided to share your holidays with us.
And we're going to begin with an improvised holiday carol.
So to get us started on that, I need, does anyone have their phone out or handy?
Any phones? Right here. Can you please open your text messages
and scroll to your third text message and read to me what is in the preview screen.
Oh, okay, great. Have a good show. I'll leave the timing up to you.
Oh, have a good show. I'll leave the timing up to you. Thank you.
I'll leave the timing up to you.
Preparing dinner is putting on a show for everyone you know.
Get the oven on. Get the beans in the casserole.
Preparing dinner is a show for everyone you know.
Oh, God, I cut the onions too thin.
And I forgot to light the pilot light.
And I'm not sure if I'm making the correct au jus.
Oh, God, the turkey's burnt and this casserole is not up to par.
But putting on a dinner is a show for everyone you know.

Oh, God, the turkey's burnt and this casserole is not up to par.
But putting on a dinner is a show for everyone you know.
Wow! Did you really make that up on the spot?
Yeah, we did.
How do you do the harmony and stuff? How do you know what to say?
The trick is a whole lot of listening. Trust. And support. And snacks.
You never know where it'll go, but that's half the fun.
In a way, it's like throwing a really good party.
Okay, well, thanks for listening. We're gonna go now.
I feel a pulse in my body that I haven't felt in years.
It's like I'm suddenly part ginger cookie.
Hey, play me more.
Okay, well, listen to this.
And moving right along, let's talk about the holidays.
I grew up in Michigan where it was very cold almost all the time, but I never got a snow day.
Did anybody else grow up where there was snow in your winter?
Yes? Show of hands. Oh, hello. What's your name?
Michelle.
Michelle, hi.
And what was your favorite part, Michelle, about growing up with all the snow that you got?
Snow day off from school and building snow forts.
Getting snow day off from school and then, of course, building snow forts.
Wonderful. And so for those of us who did not grow up with snow, do I have anybody in the area?
And by area, I mean in the house?
Yes, you, ma'am. What's your name?
Hi, I'm Annie. Oh, hi, Annie. Where did you grow up?
I grew up in Beaumont, Texas.
Beaumont, Texas. So no snow in Beaumont, Texas.
No, we once got a frost and the whole town shut down.
How exciting.
So in general, minus that one time of shutting down the town with just a frost,
what was your favorite part about the holiday season with no snow at all?
We wore, like, t-shirts and sandals and could still go to the Friday football game without a blanket or anything like that.
Yeah, who needs blankets? Football equals t-shirts and flip-flops, no blankets, all winter long.
Wonderful. Thank you, Annie. Thank you, Michelle.
This next carol is for all of you.
Nothing better than a fort, of course. Of course.
Nothing better than a fort, of course. Of course.
Nothing better than a fort, of course. Of course.
Nothing better than a fort, of course.
Nothing better than a fort, of course.
Of course.
No need to flip-flops.
No need to flip-flop. I love my flip-flops.
No need to flip-flop.
I love my flip-flops.
No need to flip-flop.
I love my flip-flops.
No need to flip-flop. I love my flip-flops.
Nothing better than a fort, of course. Of course.
Of course.
I love my flip-flops.
It'd be flippy floets.
Nothing better than a fort, of course.
Of course
Nothing better
Than a boy
Of course
Of course
I love my flip-flop
Nothing better
Than a boy
I love my flip-flop
Of course
I love my flip-flop
I love my flip-flop
Flippy-flop
The end
Thanks for listening, Laura
That was great
I'm so relieved you liked it
Oh, I feel like I want a holiday party every month now
I am never taking off this snowman sweater
Oh, hold on
My grandmother's trying to use the candy cane as an actual cane
I'll be right back
Okay, I'm back
Wait, who are you again?
We're Vern
Vern
Nice to meet you guys
Thank you so much for coming inside
After creepily stalking this party
I feel so much better now
And you know what?
I actually just put away my phone in the other room
It's time to connect with people, IRL
Should we just break out in song?
Oh, yeah
In real life
In real life
In real life
In real life
We're face to face for the holidays
Having a blast
At the best party
At the best party
At the best party
Lara
Benantier
Your party was a ten
I think that
I believe
In miracles again
Oh, my God
You have to be kidding me
That was angelic
In real life
In real life
In real life
In real life
In real life
In real life
In real life
In real life
In real life
Okay, thanks so much for coming, but I have to go to sleep now.
All right, bye.
I'm just going to take one more cookie.
Thank you.
No, but seriously, guys, leave.
Are you sure?
Yeah.
We get to stay.
Through this door?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
The front door.
Through this door?
The only door.
Okay.
There's just a lot of doors in your house.
Don't forget to close your window over there.
God.
Could I, like, sleep under the radiator?
