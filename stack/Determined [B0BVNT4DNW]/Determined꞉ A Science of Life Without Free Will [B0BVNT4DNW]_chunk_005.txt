global challenge of trying to imagine where the me is inside the machine.
But there's more.
Lessening people's belief in free will lessens their sense of agency,
as shown with the clever phenomenon of intentional binding.
Subjects view a hand sweeping around a clock face,
at a rate of one rotation every three seconds.
Whenever they wish, they press a button,
and then estimate where the hand was on the clock at the time.
Alternatively, a tone is played at random,
and subjects estimate where the hand was when that occurred.
Then, couple the two, the subject presses the button,
and the tone comes a fraction of a second later.
And people see agency there,
unconsciously perceive the tone as being caused by their button press,
perceive the two events as bound by intentionality,
and thus, minutely underestimate the time delay between the two.
Lessen people's belief in free will,
and you lessen this binding effect.
Lessening people's belief in free will
probably even has bad implications for battling addiction.
No, this is not an experiment where volunteers are turned into crackheads,
and we then see if it gets harder for them to kick the habit
if they've been reading Francis Crick.
Instead, one can infer this.
People generally perceive addiction as involving a loss of free will.
Moreover, many addiction experts believe that addicts
often adopt a deterministic view of addiction
as a destructive attribution that allows them to make excuses for themselves.
This is a fine line being negotiated.
If the choice is between labeling addiction as a biological disease
and labeling it as a weak soul, pickling, and bathtub gin,
the former is a vast, humane advance in thinking.
But as a step further,
if the choice is between labeling addiction as a biological disease
that is incompatible with free will
and labeling it as one that is,
most clinicians would view the latter label
as one more likely to help the addict stop.
Note, though, that the assumption is that
viewing addiction as incompatible with free will
is the same thing as its being incompatible with change.
That is not remotely the case.
Wait for chapter 13.
Thus, undermine someone's belief in free will
and they feel less of a sense of agency,
meaning, or self-knowledge,
less gratitude for other people's kindness.
And most important for our purposes,
they become less ethical in their behavior,
less helpful, and more aggressive.
Burn this book before anyone else stumbles upon it
and has their moral compass unmoored.
Naturally, things are more complicated.
For starters,
the effects on behavior in these studies are quite small.
Reading crick
doesn't make subjects more likely
both to cheat at some task
and to steal the researcher's laptop on the way out.
The outcomes were more amuck-ish than amuck.
Reflecting this is the important fact
that you don't typically destroy someone's belief in free will
with a dose of crick.
Instead,
you just make them a bit less ardent in their belief,
without changing the extent
to which they value their free will.
This is hardly surprising.
How likely is it
that reading a passage from a book,
being informed that scientists now question,
or even being prompted to recall a time
when you had less free will than you thought,
will have much of an effect
on your fundamental feelings
about how much agency you have in life?
A belief in free will
is generally ingrained in us
by the time we learn about the sins of gluttony
from the very hungry caterpillar.
Most important,
the bulk of studies have failed to replicate
the basic finding
that people become less ethical in their behavior
when their free will belief is weakened.
Importantly,
some of these studies had much larger sample sizes
than the original ones
that generated the
we'll-all-run-amuck conclusions.
A 2022 meta-analysis of the entire literature,
consisting of 145 experiments,
with 95 unpublished,
shows that Crickian manipulations
do indeed
mildly lessen free will belief
and increase belief in determinism,
without any consistent effects
on ethical behavior.
Thus,
the literature shows
that it is virtually impossible
to use a brief experimental manipulation
to make someone
into a true free will skeptic.
furthermore,
even if you merely lessen
someone's overall acceptance of free will,
there isn't actually
the consistent effect
of compromising their ethical behavior
in laboratory settings.
These conclusions
have to be a bit tentative
because,
all things considered,
there hasn't been a huge amount
of research in this area.
However,
don't blame me
for stealing that child's candy,
there's no free will,
has a close cousin
that has been studied
in great depth
indeed,
and the findings
are immensely interesting
and teach us a ton.
An Ideal Model System
Thus,
we consider the parallel of
there's no free will amuckness.
Do people behave immorally
when they conclude
that they will not ultimately
be held responsible
for their actions
because there is no
omnipotent someone
doling out the consequences?
As per Dostoevsky,
if there is no God,
then everything is permitted.
Even before
considering atheists,
it's worth appreciating
something about gods
who judge and punish.
They are far from
universal or ancient.
Fascinating work
by psychologist
Ara Norenzayan
of the University
of British Columbia
shows that such
moralizing gods
are relatively new
cultural inventions.
Hunter-gatherers,
whose lifestyle
has dominated
99% of human history,
do not invent
moralizing gods.
Sure,
their gods might demand
a top-of-the-line
sacrifice now and then,
but they have no interest
in whether humans
are nice to each other.
Everything about
the evolution
of cooperation
and prosociality
is facilitated
by stable,
transparent relationships
built on familiarity
and the potential
and the potential
for reciprocity.
These are precisely
the conditions
that would make
for moral constraint
in small hunter-gatherer bands,
obviating the need
for some god eavesdropping.
It was not until humans
started living
in larger communities
that religions
with moralizing gods
started to pop up.
As humans transitioned
to villages,
cities,
and then proto-states
for the first time,
human sociality
included frequent
transient
and anonymous
encounters
with strangers,
which generated
the need
to invent
all-seeing eyes
in the sky,
the moralizing gods
who dominate
the world religions.
Thus,
if belief
in a moralizing god
or gods
is what keeps us in line,
it's obvious
where lack of belief
should take you.
This generates
the inevitable exchange
that every atheist
has to endure
at some point.
Theist
How can we trust
you atheists
to be moral
if you don't think
that God
holds you responsible
for your actions?
Atheist
Well,
what does that say
about you religious people
if you only act morally
because otherwise
you'll burn in hell?
Theist
At least we have morals!
Etc.
How are we supposed
to function
if no one believes
in free will?
Much can be gleaned
by seeing how people
function when they
don't believe
in a moralizing god.
Not
Amid the common picture,
one's attitudes
about religion
and about the existence
of free will
are not
inevitably connected.
We're just looking
at atheism in depth
as a warm-up
to returning
to the challenges
of rejecting
the notion
of free will.
Atheists
gone wild
Do atheists
run amok?
Most people
sure believe that
and anti-atheist
prejudice
runs wide
and deep.
There are 52
countries in which
atheism is punishable
by death
or prison.
Most Americans
have negative
perceptions of atheists
and anti-atheist
prejudice
is more prevalent
than antipathy
toward Muslims,
which comes in
in second place,
African Americans,
LGBTQ individuals,
Jews,
or Mormons.
Such negativity
is permeating
in its consequences.
Mock juries
give atheists
longer jail sentences.
Defense attorneys
increase their
likelihood of success
in emphasizing
their clients'
theism.
People put
the supposed
atheist's name
further down
on a hypothetical list
for an organ
transplant.
Custody of a child
has been denied
to parents
because of their
atheism.
Some states
still have laws
on the books
barring atheists
from holding
public office.
In more enlightened
cantons,
voters are less
likely to elect
people because of
their atheism.
In the U.S.,
atheists have
higher rates
of clinical depression
than do the religious,
and some of this
likely reflects
atheists'
marginalized
minority status,
approximately
5% of Americans,
according to surveys.
Here's how
unlikely a place
anti-atheist
prejudice
can pop up.
Psychologists
Will Gervais
and Maxine Nyle
of the University
of Kentucky
recount the story
of a shoe company
in Germany
that was getting
a lot of complaints
from Americans.
Shoes bought online
were greatly delayed
or never delivered.
The name of the company?
Atheist Shoes.
The owner did
an experiment
where half the
shipments to America
were sent without
the company's name
on the label,
half with.
The former
were delivered promptly.
The latter
were frequently
delayed
or lost.
U.S.
pollster workers
were taking a stand
against the presumed
immorality
of those
atheistic shoemakers,
making sure
no god-fearing
American
might inadvertently
walk a mile
in those shoes.
No such phenomenon
was observed
with shoes
sent within Europe.
Why the bias
against atheists?
It's not because
they are viewed
as less warm
or competent
than religious people.
Instead,
it is always
about morality.
The widespread
belief
that believing
in a god
is essential
for morality,
held by the
majority of Americans,
and more than
90%
of people
in places like
Bangladesh,
Senegal,
Jordan,
Indonesia,
and Egypt.
People in most
countries surveyed
associate atheism
with moral
norm violations,
such as
serial murder,
incest,
or
necrobestiality.
In one study,
religious Christians
reported a sense
of visceral
disgust
when reading
an atheistic
tract.
Even atheists
associate atheism
with norm violations,
which is pretty
pathetic.
Behold,
the self-hating
atheist.
Thus,
the expectation
that atheists
might run amok
at any moment
is deeply
entrenched.
Just to soften
the sting a bit,
religious people
have similar,
if lesser,
biases
against those
spiritual but
not religious
fellow travelers.
But on to the
key question.
Do atheists
actually show
fewer pro-social
behaviors
and more
anti-social ones
than do
religious people?
Right off the
bat,
there's a huge
impediment to
getting a clear
answer to a
question like this.
Suppose you
wonder if some
new drug can
protect against
some disease.
What do you
do?
You get two
groups of
volunteers matched
for age,
sex,
medical history,
and so on.
A randomly
selected half
get the drug,
half a placebo,
without subjects
knowing which
they got.
But you can't
do that with
studies of
things like
religiosity.
You don't
take two
groups of
blank slate
volunteers,
command half
to embrace
religion,
and half to
reject it,
and then see
who is nice
out in the
world.
It's not
random who
winds up being
religious or
atheist.
As one
example that
we will
return to,
men are
more than
twice as
likely as
women to
be atheists.
Similarly,
free will
believers and
skeptics don't
get to those
stances by a
coin toss.
Another
complication in
these theist-atheist
studies is
obvious to
anyone who
has been
stranded on
a desert
island with
a Unitarian
and an
Evangelical
Southern
Baptist.
Religion and
religiosity are
crazy heterogeneous.
Which religion?
Is someone a
lifelong adherent or
a recent convert?
Is the person's
religiosity mostly
about their
personal relationship
with their
deity, with
their co-religionists,
with humans in
general?
Is their God all
about love or
smiting?
Do they typically
pray alone or
in a group?
Is their
religiosity more
about thoughts,
emotions, or
ritualism?
Nonetheless, the
bulk of studies in
this large literature
support the notion
that deciding that
there is no God
to monitor you
makes for
rottener people.
As compared with
religious people,
atheists are less
honest and
trustworthy, are
less charitable in
both experimental
settings and out in
the real world,
volunteer less of
their time.
Case closed.
The only question
now is whether
people who don't
believe in a God
or people who
don't believe in
free will run
amok faster.
What we now need
to do is to
deconstruct this
general finding,
because,
naturally, the
actual picture is
way different and
very pertinent to
free will skepticism.
saying versus
doing.
The first issue to
deal with should be
a no-brainer.
If you are
interested in these
issues, do you
observe how
charitable study
subjects are, or
do you just ask
them how often
they give to
charity?
Asking someone
just tells you how
charitable they
want to appear.
A large percentage
of the relevant
literature is based
on self-reporting
rather than
empirical data,
and it turns
out that
religious people
are more
concerned than
atheists with
maintaining a
moral reputation,
arising from the
more common
personality trait of
being concerned
about being
socially desirable.
This no doubt
reflects the fact
that theists are
more likely than
atheists to live
their moral lives
in the context of
a cohesive social
group.
Moreover, concern
of religious people
with social
desirability is
greater in
more religious
countries.
Once you
actually observe
what people do
rather than
listen to what
they say,
there's no
difference between
theists and
atheists in
rates of blood
donations,
amount of
tipping, or
compliance with
honor system
payments.
Ditto for a
lack of difference
in being altruistic,
forgiving, or
evincing gratitude.
Furthermore,
there's no
difference in being
aggressive or
vengeful in
experimental
settings where
subjects can
retaliate against
norm violation,
for example,
by administering
what they believe
to be a shock
to someone.
Thus, observe
what people do
rather than what
they say, and
the differences in
pro-sociality between
theists and
atheists mostly
disappears.
The lesson for
studying free will
believers versus
skeptics is obvious.
Collectively, the
studies examining what
people actually do in
an experimental
setting show no
difference in
ethical behavior
between the two
groups.
Old, rich,
socialized women
versus young,
poor, solitary
guys.
Back to that
self-selection
challenge.
When compared
with atheists,
religious people are
more likely to be
female, older,
married, and of
higher socioeconomic
status, and to
have a larger and
more stable social
network.
And this is a
minefield of
confounds, because
independent of
religiosity, these
are all traits
associated with
higher levels of
pro-social behavior.
Being in a stable
social network seems
to be really
important.
For example, the
increased
charitability and
volunteering found
in religious people
is not a function
of how often
they pray, but
instead, how
often they attend
their house of
worship, and
atheists who show
the same degree of
involvement in a
close-knit community
show the same
degree of good
neighborliness.
In a similar
vein, controlling
for involvement in a
social community
significantly lessens
the difference in
rates of depression
among theists
versus atheists.
Once you control
for sex, age,
socioeconomic
status, marital
status, and
sociality, most
of the differences
between theists
and atheists
disappear.
The relevance of
this point to
free will issues
is clear.
The extent to
which someone
does or doesn't
believe in free
will, and how
readily that view
can be altered
experimentally, is
probably closely
related to
variables about
age, sex,
education, and
so on, and
these might
actually be more
important predictors
of running
amokness.
When you're
primed to be
good for
goodness sake.
Where religious
people tend to
become more
pro-social than
atheists is when
you remind the
former of their
religiosity.
This can be done
explicitly.
Do you consider
yourself to be
religious?
More interesting
is when religious
people become more
pro-social after
being implicitly
primed about their
religiosity.
For example, ask
someone to
unscramble a list
of words that
includes religious
terms, versus no
such words listed, or
to list the Ten
Commandments, versus
ten books they read
in high school.
Other approaches
include having a
subject walk down a
block that does or
doesn't contain a
church, or playing
religious, versus
secular music in the
background in the
test room.
Collectively, these
studies show that
religious primes bring
out the best in
religious people,
making them more
charitable, generous,
and honest, more
resistant to
temptation, and more
capable of exerting
self-control.
In such studies, some
of the most effective
implicit primes bring
divine reward and
punishment to mind,
raising the
interesting question of
whether better
behavior is evoked
by unscrambling
L-E-H-L versus
N-E-E-H-A-V.
Now we're getting
somewhere.
When religious people
are not thinking about
their religious
principles, they sink
into the same immoral
muck as atheists, but
remind them of what
really matters, and the
halo comes out.
Two big complications.
The first is that in a
lot of these studies,
implicit religious
primes make atheists
more prosocial as
well.
After all, you don't
have to be a Christian
to decide that the
Sermon on the Mount
has good parts.
But as a more
informative complication,
while prosociality in
religious people is
boosted by religious
primes, prosociality
in atheists is
boosted just as much
by the right kinds of
secular primes.
I'd better be good,
or else I'll get
into trouble.
can certainly be
primed by ALIJ, or
E-O-C-P-L-I.
Prosociality in
atheists is also
prompted by loftier
secular concepts like
civic, duty, liberty,
and equality.
In other words,
reminders, including
implicit ones, of
one's ethical stances,
moral principles, and
values bring forth the
same degree of decency
and theists, and
atheists.
It's just that the
prosociality of the two
groups is moored in
different values and
principles, and thus
primed in different
contexts.
Obviously, then, what
counts as moral
behavior is crucial.
Work by psychologist
Jonathan Haidt of New York
University groups moral
concerns into five
domains, those related to
obedience, loyalty, purity,
fairness, and harm
avoidance.
His influential work has
shown that political
conservatives and highly
religious people tilt in
the direction of
particularly valuing
obedience, loyalty, and
purity.
The left and the
irreligious, in contrast,
are more concerned with
fairness and harm
avoidance.
This can be framed with
highfalutin philosophy.
One can approach a moral
quandary as a
deontologist, believing
that the morality of an
action should be evaluated
independently of its
consequence.
I don't care how many
lives it saves, it's never
okay to...
This contrasts with being a
consequentialist.
Well, I'm normally opposed
to X, but the good that it
will accomplish in this
case outweighs...
So, who are the
deontologists, theists, or
atheists?
It depends.
Religious people tend toward
deontology about obedience,
loyalty, and purity.
It is never okay to disobey an
order, turn on your group, or
desecrate the sacred.
However, when it comes to
issues of fairness and
harm avoidance, atheists tend
to be as deontological as
the religious.
Differences in value show up
in an additional way.
The highly religious tend to
view good works more in a
personal, private context,
helping to explain why
religious Americans donate
more of their income to
charity than do the secular.
In contrast, atheists are more
likely to view good works as a
collective responsibility,
helping to explain why they
are the ones who are more
likely to support candidates
advocating wealth
redistribution to decrease
inequality.
Thus, if you're trying to
decide who is more likely to
run amok with antisocial
behaviors, atheists will look
bad if the question is,
how much of your money would you
give to charity for the poor?
But if the question is,
how much of your money would you
pay in higher taxes for more
social services for the poor,
you'll reach a different
conclusion.
The relevance to free will
believers versus skeptics?
Obvious.
It depends on what the prime is
and what value is being evoked.
This generates a simple
prediction.
Implicitly prime someone by
asking them to spot the
misspellings in
captame of your gate.
And free will believers will be
more influenced and in the
direction of showing more
self-control.
In contrast, try
victim of
Verkham's rants.
And it is free will skeptics
who will become less punitive
and more forgiving.
One Atheist at a Time
Versus an Infestation of Them
The preceding section suggests
that deciding that there is no
omnipotent being to punish
transgressions doesn't send
atheists into a downward moral
spiral.
It should be noted, however,
that a huge percentage of the
research discussed has been with
American subjects, from a country
where only roughly 5% of people
say they are atheists.
We saw that pro-sociality could
even be enhanced in atheists by
religious primes.
Maybe the relative morality of
atheists is due to being
surrounded by the morality of all
those theists rubbing off on
them.
What would happen if most people
became atheist or irreligious?
What sort of society would they
construct when everyone is freed
from being nice due to the fear of
God?
A moral and humane one.
And this conclusion is not based on
a thought experiment.
What I'm referring to are those
ever-reliably utopian
Scandinavians.
Religiosity throughout the region
plummeted through the 20th century,
and Scandinavian countries are the most
secular in the world.
How do they stack up when compared
with a highly religious country such
as the U.S.?
Studies of quality of life and of
health show that Scandinavians fare
better on measures such as happiness
and well-being, life expectancy,
infant mortality rates, and rates of
death in childbirth.
Moreover, poverty rates are lower, and
income inequality is tiny in
comparison.
And measures of the prevalence of
antisocial behavior, crime rates, and
rates of violence and damaging
aggression, from warfare to criminal
violence to school bullying to
corporal punishment, are lower.
And as for some indices of
prosociality, Scandinavian countries'
per capita expenditures on social
services for their own citizens and as
aid for poor countries are greater.
Furthermore, these differences are not
merely Scandinavians feasting on
lutefisk versus sweaty,
capitalistic Americans.
Across a broad range of countries,
lower average rates of religiosity
predict higher rates of all these
salubrious outcomes.
Moreover, cross-nationally, lower
average rates of religiosity in a
country predict lower levels of
corruption, more tolerance of racial and
ethnic minorities, higher literacy rates,
lower rates of overall crime and of
homicide, and less frequent warfare.
Correlative studies like these always
have the major problem of not telling
anything about cause or effect.
For example, do lower rates of
religiosity result in governments
spending more on social services for
the poor?
Or does governments spending more on
such services result in lower rates of
religiosity?
Or do both arise from a third factor?
It's hard to answer, even with the
well-documented Scandinavian profile,
since the decline in religiosity and the
Scandinavian social welfare model emerged
in parallel.
It's probably some of both.
The preference of atheists for collective
responsibility for good works would
certainly help foster Scandinavian models.
And as societies become more economically
stable and safer, rates of religious belief
decline.
Separate from these complex chicken-and-egg
issues, we have a clear answer to our
question of whether less religious
countries swarm with citizens running
amok.
Not at all.
In fact, they're downright Edenic.
Thus, it is not the case that atheists
match theists in their morality simply
because, thank God, gods, the former are
constrained by the abundance of the latter.
My guess is that similarly, ethical
behavior by free will skeptics is not a
function of there being a minority
surrounded by go-getters brimming with a
sense of agency.
This brings us to what is probably the most
important point in evaluating whether
religious people are more pro-social
than atheists, as well as considering the
prospects of free will believers being
more pro-social than free will skeptics.
Who needs the help?
Even after controlling for factors like
self-reporting or demographic correlates
of religiosity, and after considering broader
definitions of pro-sociality, religious
people still come through as being more pro-social
than atheists, in some experimental, as well
as real-world settings.
Which leads us to a really crucial point.
Religious pro-sociality is mostly about
religious people being nice to people
like themselves.
It's mostly in-group.
In economic games, for example, the enhanced
honesty of religious subjects extends only to
other players described to them as
co-religionists, something made more extreme
by religious primes.
Moreover, the greater charitability of
religious people and studies is accounted
for by their contributing more to co-religionists.
And the bulk of the charitability of highly
religious people in the real world consists
of charity to their own group.
But being on guard for confounds, maybe this is a
spurious relationship.
Maybe religious people are kinder to co-religionists
because they are likely to be living among them.
Thus, maybe the kindness is driven not by the
religiosity, but by the familiarity.
This is probably not the case, though.
For example, one cross-cultural study of 15
different societies showed that in-group favoritism
of religious people extended to distant co-religionists
they had never met.
Thus, despite claims toward universal niceness,
theistic niceness tends to be in-group.
Moreover, this is particularly pronounced in religious groups
characterized by fundamentalist belief and authoritarianism.
How about when it comes to out-group members?
In those circumstances, it is atheists who are more pro-social,
including more accepting of and extending protection
to thems.
Moreover, religious primes can make religious people
more prejudiced against out-group members,
including increasing vengefulness and willingness
to punish their transgressions.
In one classic study, religious schoolchildren viewed it
as unacceptable for a population of innocent people
to be destroyed, unless it was presented as Joshua's destruction
of the innocent population of Jericho in the Old Testament.
In another, religious primes resulted in fundamentalist
West Bank Jewish settlers expressing more admiration
for a Jewish terrorist who had killed Palestinians.
In one study, merely walking past a church resulted in
religious Christians expressing more negative feelings
about atheists, ethnic minorities, and LGBTQ individuals.
In another, priming Christian subjects
with the Christian version of the Golden Rule
did not reduce homophobia.
However, priming them with what they were told
was the Buddhist equivalent of the Golden Rule
increased homophobia.
Finally, some off-cited studies looked at
how aggressive subjects would be
to an opponent in a game, that is,
the volume of loud noise they would choose
to blast the other player with.
Such aggressiveness was increased
when subjects had first read a passage
mentioning God or the Bible,
relative to passages without that.
Aggressiveness was increased
even more when subjects read a passage about
biblical vengefulness, sanctioned by God,
versus the same description of vengefulness
without the divine sanction.
Thus, a variety of studies
showed that when it comes to theists
versus non-theists being kind to someone,
it really depends on who that someone is.
And the majority of experimental studies
examining these issues
have involved subjects thinking about
in-group members.
Just imagine,
a professor who studies the subject
recruits a bunch of Psych 101 students
to participate in a study
of how generous and trustworthy they are.
As part of it,
they play an online economic game,
supposedly against someone in the next room.
Who do you imagine the students
implicitly assume is in that next room?
A fellow classmate?
Or a yak herder from Bhutan?
Experimental designs like these
implicitly prompt subjects
to think of other participants,
hypothetical or otherwise,
as in-group members,
thus disproportionately priming
for more pro-sociality
from theists
than from atheists.
How would the issue of
who is being helped
play out in comparing
free-will believers
with skeptics?
I would imagine that
free-will believers
will feel more of a moral imperative
versus an instrumental strategy
to help someone
who is making an extra effort
at something,
while free-will skeptics
will feel more of an imperative
to understand the actions
of someone very different from them.
We return to the broad question
in this section.
Does disbelief that one's actions
are judged by an omnipotent force
degrade morality?
Seemingly so.
That is,
as long as you are asking people
to say how moral they are
rather than to demonstrate it,
or you prime them
with religious cues
rather than secular ones
of equivalent symbolic power,
and as long as
good acts
are individualistic
rather than collective
and are directed
at people
who look like them.
Skepticism about
the existence
of a moralizing god
or gods
doesn't particularly
generate
immoral behavior.
This is the case
for underlying reasons
that help explain
why being skeptical
about free-will
doesn't either.
Now to the most important point
about the menace
of skeptics
running amok.
Asking about differences
between free-will believers
and skeptics
is the wrong question.
Into the Valley
of the Indifferent
Consider this
U-shaped curve.
On the left,
A,
are people who firmly believe
that there is no free will,
period.
In the trough,
B,
are those whose belief
in free will
is a bit malleable
while on the right,
C,
are those whose belief
in free will
is unshakable.
Back to the temptation
of Crick.
The collection
of volunteer subjects
in the studies reviewed
was almost certainly
comprised of people
in category B
or C,
given the rarity
with which free will
is completely rejected.
What collectively
do those studies show?
First,
when free will believers
read about how
there is no free will,
on the average,
there is a small decrease
in belief in free will
and with a lot of variability,
reflecting the fact
that some of the people
are unmoved by arguments
against free will.
As such,
subjects whose belief shifts
can be thought of
as category B,
those who are unshakable
category C.
The more a subject's
faith in free will
is shifted,
the more likely
they are to act
unethically in the experiment.
In other words,
when it comes to beliefs
about the nature
of human agency
and responsibility,
it's category B people
who run amok,
not those in category C.
This entire literature
bypasses the thing
we're really interested in,
which is whether
categories A and C
differ in their
moral uprightness.
To my knowledge,
only one study
has examined
this explicit question,
carried out by
psychologist Damien Crone,
then at the University
of Melbourne in Australia,
and philosopher Neil Levy,
whose ideas
have already been discussed.
Subjects stoutly believed
in free will,
or were those
who identified
their free will skepticism
as long-standing.
The really excellent study
even examined the reasons
why particular subjects
rejected free will.
Contrasting scientific determinists,
endorsing statements like
your genes determine
your future,
with fatalistic determinists,
the future has already
been determined by fate.
In other words,
these were free will skeptics
who had arrived
at their stances
through different emotional
and cognitive routes.
The commonality
was that they had rejected
belief in free will
long ago.
The results?
Free will skeptics
of whatever stripe
and free will believers
were identical
in their ethical behavior.
And as a finding
that ultimately
tells the whole story,
people who most
defined themselves
by their moral identity
were the most honest
and generous,
regardless of their stance
about free will.
The identical pattern
holds when considering
religious belief
and morality.
Category A
are atheists
whose paths
to that view
are scarred with craters.
Losing my religion
was the loneliest moment
of my life.
Or,
it would have been
so easy to continue
after all those years,
but that's when
I left my seminary.
Category C
people for whom
their belief
is daily bread
rather than cake
on Sunday,
informing their
every action,
who know who they are
and what God
expects them to do.
And then there is
Category B,
covering the range
from apatheists,
for whom saying
that they don't believe
in God
is like saying
that they don't ski,
as well as those
whose religiosity
is out of habit,
convention,
nostalgia.
An example
for the kids.
Of the 90%
of Americans
who are theists,
probably half
fall into this category,
given that
approximately half
don't go to
religious services
regularly.
As the immensely
important point,
when it comes
to ethical behavior,
daily bread theists
and daily bread atheists
resemble each other
more than they resemble
those in Category B.
For example,
highly religious
and highly secular people
score the same
on tests
of conscientiousness,
coming out higher
than those
in the third group.
In experimental studies
of obedience,
usually variants
on the classic research
of Stanley Milgram
examining how willing
subjects are
to obey in order
to shock someone,
the greatest rates
of compliance
came from religious
moderates,
whereas extreme believers
and extreme non-believers
were equally resistant.
In another study,
doctors who had chosen
to care for the underserved
at the cost
of personal income
were disproportionately
highly religious
or highly irreligious.
moreover,
classic studies
of the people
who risked their lives
to save Jews
during the Holocaust
documented that
these people
who could not look
the other way
were disproportionately
likely to be
either highly religious
or highly irreligious.
Here is our vitally
important reason
for optimism
about how the sky
won't necessarily fall
if people
come to stop
believing
in free will.
There are people
who have thought
long and hard
about, say,
what early life
privilege or adversity
does to the development
of the frontal cortex
and have concluded
there's no free will
and here's why.
They are a mirror
of the people
who have thought
long and hard
about the same
and concluded
there's still free will
and here's why.
The similarities
between the two
are ultimately
greater than the differences
and the real contrast
is between them
and those
whose reaction
to questions
about the roots
of our moral decency
is whatever.
12.
The Ancient Gears Within Us
How Does Change Happen?
This book has a goal
to get people
to think differently
about moral responsibility,
blame and praise,
and the notion
of our being free agents,
and to feel differently
about those issues
as well.
And most of all,
to change
fundamental aspects
of how we behave.
This is the goal
of many of the things
we are exposed to.
To change our behavior.
That's certainly
what is going on
with most speeches,
lectures, books.
For example,
to change
whom you vote for,
what you believe
the first seven days
of the universe
were like,
or your commitment
to the workers
of the world
uniting and losing
their chains.
The same for lots
of our interpersonal
interactions.
To persuade,
convince,
recruit,
compel,
repel,
induce,
seduce.
And of course,
there are the efforts
to get you
to change your behavior
in a way that will make
every remaining moment
of your life
so much happier
if only you buy
the object
being advertised.
All these ways
to make you
and everyone else
change their behavior.
Which raises
a gigantic question.
Last chapter's question
was,
if people stopped
believing in free will,
would there be
a moral chaos?
This chapter's question
is,
if there is no free will,
how does anything
ever change?
How do you decide
shortly after this sentence
to change your behavior
and grab a brownie?
If the world
is deterministic
on the level
that matters,
isn't everything
thus already determined?
The answer is
that we don't
change our minds.
Our minds,
which are the end products
of all the biological moments
that came before,
are changed
by circumstances
around us,
which seems like
a thoroughly
unsatisfying response
that is incompatible
with your intuitions
about how you function.
As such,
the goal of this chapter
is to reconcile
in absence of free will
with the fact
that change occurs.
To do so,
we're going to look at
how behavior changes
in organisms
far simpler than humans,
down on the level
of molecules
and genes.
This will segue
to considering
behavioral change
in us.
Hopefully,
this will make clear
an immensely important point.
When our behavior changes,
it doesn't involve
biology with some
themes and motifs
similar to ones
seen in these
simpler organisms.
It involves
the same molecules,
genes,
and mechanisms
of neuronal function.
When you begin
to be biased
against some
alien group of people
because their customs
differ from your own,
the biology
underlying your
change in behavior
is the same
as when a sea slug
learns to avoid
a shock
administered by
a researcher.
And that sea slug
sure isn't displaying
free will
when that change occurs.
Remarkably,
and probably
most important,
the antiquity
and ubiquity
of these biological gears
explaining behavioral change
wind up being
grounds for optimism.
Protecting your gill
We start with a sea slug,
specifically,
Aplegia californica,
the California sea hair,
a gigantic slug
that can be more
than two feet long.
Neuroscientists
love this species,
write operas about it,
all because one
of the most important,
beautiful,
inspiring pieces
of neuroscience research
in the 20th century
was done with it.
See figure 12.1
in the accompanying PDF.
On the surface
of an Aplegia
is its gill,
which is majorly important
to an Aplegia surviving.
If you lightly touch
the area surrounding
the gill,
called the siphon,
the Aplegia
protectively retracts
its gill inward
for a while.
The circuitry
underlying this
is straightforward.
Throughout the siphon
are sensory neurons,
SNs,
which have action potentials
if anything touches
the siphon.
Once activated,
the SNs activate
motor neurons,
MNs,
which retract the gill.
The gill is essential
for survival,
and Aplegia
have evolved
a backup pathway
in case the SN-MN
connection fails.
It turns out
that the SN
also sends a projection
to a little local
excitatory node,
EXC.
Now,
when the siphon
is touched,
the SN activates
both the MNs
and this EXC node.
The latter sends
a projection
onto the MN,
activating it.
Thus,
if the SN-MN
connection fails,
there's still
the SN-EXC-MN
root available.
The gill
can't remain
retracted forever,
as it needs to be
on the surface
to function.
Thus,
after a bit of time,
retraction
has to be halted.
An off switch
has evolved
to do this.
When the SN
is activated,
not only does it
activate MN
and EXC,
but after a delay,
it also activates
a small inhibitory node,
INH.
This node
then inhibits
the EXC branch,
which, remember,
is the delayed
root from SN
to MN.
So it's the one
to target
with this
delayed inhibition.
Result.
The MN
is no longer
being activated,
so the gill
defaults back
to the surface.
This SN
MN
EXC
INH
circuitry
is not a world
unto itself.
The way it works
can be altered
by what's happening
throughout the rest
of the aplysia.
At the tail end
of an aplysia
is its,
well,
tail.
If you shock
the tail,
it basically sends
an alarm signal
to the siphon.
As a result,
if the siphon
is touched
soon after that,
the gill
is withdrawn
for twice as long
as usual.
Worrisome news
at the tail
makes the siphon
more responsive
to its own
worrisome news.
How are we going
to wire things up
so that events
in the tail
make gill withdrawal
more sensitive?
Pretty straightforward.
There has to be
a tail sensory neuron,
TSN,
that is responsive
to shock,
and it has to have
the means
to then talk
to the SN
MN
EXC
INH
circuit.
When the TSN
is activated,
it makes both
the SN
and the EXC
more excitable.
Note that a tail
shock doesn't cause
the gill to be
retracted.
The excitation
from TSN
isn't strong enough
to activate
MN on its own.
Instead,
the TSN input
is enhancing
the strength
of SN-MN
signaling in response
to the siphon
being touched.
In other words,
a tail shock
sensitizes
the gill
withdrawal reflex.
Perfect.
The aplysia
can retract
the gill
in response
to the siphon
being perturbed,
has a backup
system for that
just in case,
has a means
to reverse
the process
back to where
things started,
and can make
the circuit
more jumpy
and vigilant
if bad things
are happening
to other parts
of the aplysia.
Why do we know
so much about
the inner life
of an aplysia?
Because of the work
of one of the gods
of neuroscience.
Eric Kandel
of Columbia
University.
Here's a figure
from his 2000
Nobel Prize
lecture.
See figure 12.5
in the accompanying
PDF file.
This is cool
beyond description,
just the clarity
of this wiring
system that
this slug evolved.
Unfortunately,
though,
it is also irrelevant
to our interests.
It has more in common
with how your microwave
works than with
what's going on
in us when we
erroneously believe
that we are acting
out of free will.
For that,
we need to look at
something much more
interesting that happens
in an aplysia.
This circuit will
change in response
to experience.
It can be trained.
It learns.
The learned
aplysia.
As we've seen,
here are two
basic rules.
First,
if an aplysia's
siphon is touched,
the gill retracts
for a bit.
Second,
if the siphon is touched
within a minute
of the tail being
shocked,
the gill is retracted
for twice as long.
But there's more.
How about if the tail
has been shocked
four times?
If the siphon is touched
within four hours
of that happening,
the gill is retracted
three times longer
than usual.
Shock the tail
a cluster of times,
and if the siphon
is then touched
within the next
few weeks,
the gill is retracted
ten times longer
than usual.
As the world
becomes a more
menacing place,
an aplysia
becomes more
protective of its gill.
How does that work?
We know from
our basic neuro
how the SN-MN
connection works.
As a result
of the siphon
being touched,
the SN
releases
neurotransmitter,
which then triggers
the MN
into retracting
the gill.
Now we need to see
what happens
inside the SN
when the tail
is getting shocked.
The SM
and MN
are drawn
very differently now,
with little packets
of neurotransmitter
lined up at the bottom
of the SN,
the little circles,
and with the MN
and its neurotransmitter
receptors,
little horizontal lines,
on the lower side
of the synapse.
The tail sensory neuron
has been activated
by one shock,
causing it to release
its neurotransmitter,
which binds
to a receptor
on the SN.
As a result
of a single shock,
some sort of
TSN activity
dependent stuff,
which we'll call
stuff,
is released
inside the SN.
That stuff
within the SN
glides to the bottom,
where it beefs up
the amount of
neurotransmitters
stored there,
step number one.
As a result,
if the siphon
is touched,
enough additional
neurotransmitter
is released
by the SN
to cause the gill
to retract
for twice as long
as usual.
Within a minute
or so
of the single shock,
the extra neurotransmitter
stored in the SN
is degraded,
and things go back
to normal.
What if the tail
is shocked
four times
in rapid succession?
As a result,
a whole lot more
stuff is liberated
inside the SN
than with one shock.
Not only
does this trigger
the events
of step one,
obviously,
but also
the surplus stuff
is enough
to trigger
step two.
That additional
stuff activates
a gene
on the DNA
that produces
a protein
that stabilizes
the neurotransmitter
so that it is
resistant
to degradation.
As a result,
the neurotransmitter
sticks around longer,
and if the siphon
is touched,
enough additional
neurotransmitter
is released
by the SN
to cause
the gill
to retract
for three times
as long
as usual.
By four hours
after that quartet
of shocks,
the degradation
inhibiting protein
is itself
degraded.
As a result,
the extra neurotransmitter
is degraded,
and things go back
to normal.
Now,
what if the tail
is shocked
with an intense,
sustained cluster
of shocks
on a few
successive days?
Humongous amounts
of stuff
are released,
enough to activate
not only steps
number one
and number two,
but number three
as well.
For that final step,
stuff activates
a whole string
of genes
whose resulting
proteins,
collectively,
lead to the
construction
of an additional
synapse.
Now,
if the siphon
is touched,
enough additional
neurotransmitter
is released
by the SN
to cause
the gale
to retract
for ten times
as long
as usual.
Weeks to months
later,
the new synapse
is deconstructed
and things
go back
to normal.
Thus,
we have a
hierarchy.
For a single
shock,
you add more
copies of some
molecule that
already exists.
For four shocks,
you generate
something novel
to interact
with that molecule
that already
exists.
For a massive
cluster of shocks,
you start a whole
construction project.
All very
logical.
And this is
precisely what
Kandel showed
as well,
taken from
that same
Nobel Prize
talk.
What exactly
did he show
goes on
in an
Aplegia SN
when this
is happening?
Just skim
this paragraph
and don't
memorize a
word of it.
In fact,
probably don't
even listen
to it.
Just know
how to find
it again
later.
The details.
A.
What's
actually
happening
in step
number one?
The
neurotransmitter
5-HT
triggers the
release of
C-A-M-P
CAMP,
which activates
previously
inactivated
PKA,
which works
on the
K-plus
potassium channel
to trigger
an influx
of
C-A-2-plus
calcium ions
through
C-A-2-plus
channels,
which results
in the release
of a greater
amount of
neurotransmitter.
B.
Step
number two.
Enough
camp is
poured in
not just
to activate
step number
one,
but also
to spill
over and
cause
MAPK
to cleave
CREB2
from CREB1,
freeing the
latter to
dimerize into
pairs of
CREB1,
which interacts
with the
CRE promoter,
which turns
on an early
phase gene
that leads
to the
synthesis
of the
enzyme
ubiquitin
hydrolase,
which stabilizes
pKa,
allowing it
to have
its effects
longer.
C.
Step
number three.
The influx
of camp
is large
enough that
not only
are steps
number one
and number
two activated,
but number
three is
as well.
This leads
to liberation
and dimerization
of enough
CREB1
to not only
activate the
ubiquitin
hydrolase
gene,
but the
CEBP
gene as
well.
CEBP
proteins then
activate an
array of
late-response
genes whose
protein products
collectively
construct a
second synaptic
branch.
Almost half
a century of
work by
Kandel,
his students
and collaborators,
eventually a
whole field of
neuroscientists
building on
those findings,
all to answer
a just-so
question.
Why did the
traumatized
aplysia retract
its gill for
so long?
We have built
a machine on
both the
level of
neurons
communicating
with each
other in a
circuit,
and the
level of
chemical
changes
inside a
single
key
neuron.
This is a
machine that
is entirely
mechanistic in
biological terms
and that
changes
adaptively in
response to
a changing
environment.
It has even
been used as
a model by
roboticists.
I dare
anyone to
invoke the
concept of
free will
in making
sense of
this
aplysia's
behavior.
No
aplysia
encountering
another one
would say,
it's been a
tough season.
Thanks for
asking.
Lots and
lots of
shocks,
no idea
why.
I had to
build new
synapses on
every neuron
in my
siphon.
I guess my
gill is safe
now, but I
sure don't
feel safe.
This has been
hell on my
partner.
We're watching
a machine that
did not choose
to change its
behavior.
Its behavior
was changed
by circumstances,
biological,
highly evolved
pathways.
And why is
this the
most gorgeous
piece of
neurobiological
insight ever?
Because pretty
much the same
thing goes on
in us when
we have become
the sort of
person who
would pull a
trigger, or
run into a
burning building
to save a
child, or
steal an
extra cookie,
or advocate
hard incompatibilism
in a book
destined to be
read only by
two people
who will hate
it.
The circuits
and molecules
of the
aplysia are
all the
building blocks
we need to
make sense
of behavioral
change in
us.
Which, no
doubt, seems
absurd, totally
implausible, leaping
from aplysia to
us.
Thus, we're
going to get
there with a
few in-between
examples, but
in less agonizing
detail than has
gone into
understanding
aplysia behavioral
machinery.
When we're
done, the
hard reality is
that we are
unimaginably more
complex than
in aplysia, but
our biological
machines with
the same
building blocks
and the
same
mechanisms of
change.
Detecting a
coincidence
Our next
neuronal
machine blinks
its eye.
Go up to
it, spritz a
little puff of
air on its
eyelid, and
the eyelid blinks
automatically, as
a protective
reflex.
We already know
the simple
circuitry needed
to pull this
off.
There's a
sensory neuron
that has an
action potential
in response to
an air puff.
This then
triggers an
action potential
in a motor
neuron, causing
the eyelid to
blink.
Now let's add a
totally useless
additional piece of
circuitry.
We have a second
sensory neuron.
This one doesn't
respond to the
tactile stimulation
of an air puff.
Instead, it
responds to an
auditory stimulus,
a tone.
Neuron 3 projects
to the blink motor
neuron, where it
isn't excitatory
enough to cause
an action potential
in neuron 2.
Play the tone, and
nothing happens in
neuron 2.
Let's make that
side path even more
ornately useless.
Now the tone is
played, activating
neuron 3.
As before, neuron 3
isn't able to cause
an action potential
in neuron 2.
However, it does
so in neuron 4.
But as it turns out,
the neuron 4 action
potential has only
about half the
excitatory power
needed to evoke an
action potential in
neuron 5.
So stimulate neuron
3 with a tone, and
the net result is that
nothing happens in
either neuron 2 or
neuron 5.
A tone still does
nothing to blinking.
Let's add another
useless projection to
this circuit.
Now neuron 1 sends
a projection to
neuron 5, along with
its usual projection
neuron 2.
But when an air
puff triggers an
action potential in
neuron 1, it gets
only halfway to the
excitation needed for
neuron 5 to have an
action potential.
So, air puff, neuron
2 activates, nothing
happens in neuron 5.
But now let's
activate neuron 1 and
neuron 3.
Play a tone, and
release an air puff.
Crucially, the tone
comes 1 second before
the air puff, and it
takes a second for any
action potential to
reach the axon
terminals.
So, at time 0, play
the tone, neuron 3 has
an action potential.
After 1 second, neuron 4
has an action potential,
thanks to neuron 3.
While the air puff is
now causing an action
potential in neuron 1.
After 2 seconds, neuron 2
has an action potential,
thanks to neuron 1,
triggering an eye blink.
Meanwhile, the action
potentials from neurons
4 and 1 arrive at
neuron 5.
Again, neither of those
two inputs is enough to
trigger an action
potential alone.
But when they are
combined, neuron 5 has
an action potential.
In other words, neuron 5
has an action potential if
and only if the tone is
played and is followed
by an air puff one
second later.
The circuit allows
neuron 5 to detect
that the two stimuli
coincided.
Or, to use the jargon
of the field, neuron 5
is a coincidence detector.
After 3 seconds, neuron 5
has its action potential,
causing it to stimulate
the axon terminals of
neuron 3, which, as it
turns out, accomplishes
nothing.
It isn't strong enough
to, say, cause those
axon terminals to dump
much neurotransmitter.
But, play the tone
followed by the air puff
a second time.
A tenth time.
A hundredth time.
Each time neuron 5
stimulates the axon
terminals of neuron 3,
it slowly causes neuron 3
to build up more
neurotransmitter there,
release more of it
each time, until,
finally, when neuron 3
is stimulated by the
tone, it triggers an
action potential in
neuron 2.
And the machine blinks
before the air puff
happens.
Blinks in anticipation
of it.
It's called eye blink
conditioning, and it
works this way in
mammals, in lab rats,
rabbits, in humans.
It's useful, adaptive.
It's great to be
conditioned to close
your eyelids protectively
before, rather than
after, a noxious
stimulus occurs.
We know the underlying
circuit in a different
famous setting, one that
gives the phenomenon its
name.
Pavlovian conditioning.
Old Doc Pavlov lets his
dog smell dinner.
Dog salivates.
This is the circuit of
neurons 1 and 2.
Neuron 1 smells the food.
Neuron 2 stimulates
salivary gland.
Dog drools.
Thus, we have an
unconditioned stimulus,
the smell, which
automatically evokes the
unconditioned response
of salivating.
Now ring the bell just
before the food arrives.
Pair the two over and
over, and thanks to
neurons 1, 3, 4, and
5, you establish a
conditioned stimulus and
a conditioned response.
Ring the bell, and the
dog salivates in
anticipation of the
smell of the food.
The key spot where
change happens is in the
place where neuron 5
terminates on neuron 3.
How does the former
repeatedly stimulating
the axon terminals of
ladder result in the
ladder increasing the
amount of neurotransmitter
released, eventually
gaining the power to
elicit an eye blink on
its own?
Go back to the
description of the
inner workings of the
SN in an
aplysia.
How does eye blink
conditioning work?
By neurotransmitter from
neuron 5 releasing camp
inside neuron 3, which
frees PKA from its
break, which activates
MAPK and CREB, which
activates certain genes,
culminating in, among other
changes, the formation of
new synapses.
This is not neuron 5
causes the intracellular
release of chemicals that
kind of function like
stuff in aplysia.
It's the same chemical
messengers.
Think about this.
Humans, be conditioned
to blink their eyes, and
marine sea slugs, conditioned
to withdraw their gills,
haven't shared a common
ancestor for more than
half a billion years.
And here we are, with
their neurons and ours, using
the same intracellular
machinery for changing in
response to experience.
You and an aplysia could
trade your camps, PKA's,
MAPK's, and so on, and
things would work just fine
in both of you.
And you'd both be using
serotonin to kickstart
this.
These aplysia-slash-human
similarities should demolish
anyone's skepticism about
evolution.
More important for our
purposes, these findings show
that, just as with the
aplysia-gill-withdrawal
reflex, we can build
ourselves deterministic
circuits with deterministic
neurons that explain an
adaptive change in human
behavior in response to
experience, all without
having to invoke the notion
of our choosing to start
blinking our eyelids when we
hear a tone.
Booyah!
We've crushed any
philosopher whose life
work is premised on the
notion that we have free
will, because we can be
eye-blink conditioned.
Yeah, yeah, this is not a
very fancy outpost of human
behavior.
Nevertheless, it's fancier
than you might think.
To appreciate that, what
happens to lab rats if,
when they were pups, they
were intermittently
separated from their
mothers for a while?
Rats that experienced such
maternal separation early in
life are, as adults, a mess.
They are more anxious, show
more of a glucocorticoid
response to mild stress, don't
learn as well, are easier to
addict to alcohol or
cocaine.
It is a model for how one
type of early life adversity
in humans produces
dysfunctional adults, and
people know tons about how
each of those changes comes
about in the brain.
So, get this.
Take a rat pup and
maternally separate him, and
as an adult, it will be
harder to do eye-blink
conditioning on him.
In other words, along with
all the other deleterious
consequences of maternal
separation, you have
animals that don't acquire
this adaptive response as
readily.
It is caused by an
epigenetic change in the
brain, such that, forever
after, there are elevated
levels of receptors for
glucocorticoid stress
hormones in the equivalence
of neuron 2.
Block the effects of
glucocorticoids in that
adult rat, and eye-blink
conditioning becomes
normal.
Conclusion
Early life adversity
impairs this circuit by
making a keen neuron in the
circuit more sensitive to
stress.
Take one lone heroic rat
that, for some reason, can
save the world from disaster by
developing a conditioned
eye-blink response.
And he screws up.
Doesn't do it.
Let's the world down.
Afterward, everyone is
pissed at the rat, blaming
him for not conditioning.
To which he can say,
It's not my fault.
I didn't get conditioned
because, one second before,
my interpositus nucleus
wasn't as responsive to the
conditioned stimulus.
Because, a few hours before,
my stress hormone levels were
elevated, which guaranteed
that the interpositus would be
particularly resistant to
conditioning.
Because, back in my
childhood, my mother was
taken from me.
And this changed gene
regulation in the interpositus,
permanently increasing
levels of a hormone
receptor there.
Because, back millions of
years ago, my species
evolved to be highly
dependent on maternal care
after birth.
And the genes needed to make
lifelong changes in
circuitry if the mother is
absent.
A change in behavior due to
specific changes that can be
identified in a circuit, arising
from circumstances a second, an
hour, a lifetime, an evolutionary
epoch earlier, over which the
organism had no control.
No rodential moral responsibility
involved, no grounds for
everyone blaming the rat.
But still, this is just about
blinking your eyes.
On to the sorts of scenarios that
this whole book is about.
When they become
thems
Not many of the world's
problems arise from the fact that
a neutral stimulus can be
conditioned to evoke an
eye-blink reflex.
But a lot of them sure arise from
the same going on in the amygdala.
Take a lab rat or a human
volunteer and give them a shock.
The amygdala activates.
You can show this in the rat by
recording the activity of neurons
in the amygdala with electrodes.
While in humans, you show the same
with brain imaging.
To prepare us for the subtleties to
come, right off the bat, the link
between shock and amygdaloid
activation is modulated in all sorts
of interesting ways.
For example, in both the rat and the
human, the amygdala activates more if
the shock occurs unpredictably, rather
than if you know when the shock is
coming.
Once the amygdala activates, it
triggers a variety of responses.
The sympathetic nervous system is
activated.
The heart beats faster.
Blood pressure rises.
Glucocorticoids are secreted.
Your typical rat or human freezes in
place.
Non-trivially, if that rat has a
smaller and weaker rat next to them,
the rat that has been shocked
becomes more likely to bite the
other, which lessens their own
stress response.
So, this is a version of an SN-MN
circuit, by now familiar.
Now, before each shock, play a tone as
a conditioned stimulus.
Do it a bunch of times, and you know
what happens.
The tone itself will eventually have
gained the power to activate the
amygdala, and we have a conditioned
fear response.
Beautiful work by Joseph Ledoux of
New York University has revealed the
circuitry to explain this.
Look at it closely, and what do you
know?
It's the same basic wiring as for
conditioning an eye blink or a gill
withdrawal.
If timed right, information about the
unconditioned stimulus, the shock,
mediated by the somatosensory
thalamus and cortex, and about the
conditioned one, the tone, mediated by
the auditory branch, just as with
conditioned eye blinking, simultaneously
converge on the amygdala.
Local neurons there act as coincidence
detectors.
Repeated stimulation of the auditory
branch induces all sorts of changes in
the amygdala, involving CAMP, PKA,
CREB, all the usual.
And a tone now elicits the same terror
that a shock does.
We saw that something as simple as eye
blink conditioning reflects a nervous
system that has been sculpted by all
that came before it.
For example, early maternal experience.
The acquisition, consolidation, and
extinction of the conditioned fear of
something neutral like a tone reflects
the organism's history even more.
Extinction will occur faster if, in the
seconds before, there are high levels in
the amygdala of endocannabinoids, whose
receptor also binds THC, the most active
component of cannabis.
This makes it easier to stop being afraid
of something.
The amygdala becomes less likely to store
away a conditioned fear response as a
stable memory if, in the previous hours,
the individual has taken an SSRI
antidepressant like Prozac, which make
people ruminate less about negative
thoughts. The amygdala will be less
active and harder to condition if, in
the days before, it was exposed to high
circulating levels of oxytocin, which
helps explain how oxytocin can promote
trust. In contrast, if the organism has
been exposed to high levels of stress
hormones in the previous month, it
becomes easier to generate a conditioned
fear response, thanks to the hormones
increasing activity of the gene that
produces the mammalian version of CEBP.
And pushing way back in our one second
before, one minute before arc, if an
organism was exposed to lots of mom's
alcohol back during fetal life, it has a
harder time remembering a conditioned
fear. And, of course, what versions of the
genes related to those are present, and
whether the individual species evolved those
genes in the first place, will influence how
readily conditioning occurs. How easily an
organism learns to be afraid of something as
simple as a tone is the end product of all
these influences on the workings of this
circuit, all factors over which the
individual had no control. All this for a
tone. Consider something else that activates
your amygdala. In this case, hearing the word
rapist. You're not genetically programmed to
activate your amygdala in response to it, not
the way it would automatically activate if, say,
you were dangled upside down by a thread up in
the air while covered with spiders and snakes.
Instead, the amygdala came to respond to the word
through learning. You learn what the two syllables
mean, what the act is. You've learned about its
impact in general. How being raped, as it's been
said, is like living through your own murder. You
know someone who was, or, unbearably, you yourself
were. In any case, you now have an amygdala that
activates automatically in response to the word, as
surely as if you were given a shock. Now let's take a
neutral stimulus and rely upon the coincidence
detectors in our amygdalas to generate a conditioned
fear response. Something more complex than a bell that
would make Pavlov's dogs salivate, or a tone that
would cause a lab rat to freeze. When Mexico sends its
people, they're not sending their best. They're not
sending you. They're not sending you. They're sending
people that have lots of problems, and they're bringing
those problems with us. They're bringing drugs. They're
bringing crime. They're rapists. Donald Trump, in the
speech that famously opened his presidential campaign, June
16th, 2015. Students of History and Current Events. Let's
play a game called Match the Conditioned and
Unconditioned Stimulus. Get them all right, and you win a
prize. So have fun. Condition stimulus and the people who
labor to generate that association. 1. Muslims, according to
European nationalists. Unconditioned stimulus. A. Vermin,
rodents. 2. Jews, according to the Nazis. B. Thieves, pickpockets.
3. Indo-Pakistanis, according to half the Kenyans I know. C. Opium
addicts. 4. Irish immigrants, according to 19th century wasps. D. A
malignancy, a cancer. 5. Roma, according to centuries of
Europeans. E. Violent superpredators. 6. Mexicans, according to Donald Trump.
This is a freebie thrown in. F. Rapists. 7. Young African-American men, according to
swaths of white America. G. Shop owners who cheat you. 8. Chinese immigrants, according to
19th century America. H. Cockroaches. 9. Tutsi, according to the Hutu architects of the Rwandan
genocide. I. Drunken papists. Yes, yes, it's hard because there are overlaps, but come on,
give it your best shot. The question now becomes how readily you come to associate Mexicans with
rapists while undergoing Trumpian conditioning. How resistant or vulnerable are you to forming that
automatic stereotype in your mind? As usual, it depends on what happened one second before
hearing his statement, one minute before, and so on. Here are all sorts of circumstances that
increase the odds of your being successfully conditioned by the man if you are your basic
white bread American. If you are exhausted, hungry, or drunk. If something frightening happened
to you in the previous minute. If, as a male, your testosterone levels have been soaring over
the last few days. If, in recent months, you've been chronically stressed by, say, unemployment.
If, when you were in your 20s, your musical tastes led you to become an uberfan of some musician
who espoused that stereotype. If you lived in an ethnically homogenous neighborhood as a teenager.
If you were psychologically or physically abused as a child. If your mother's values were those of a
xenophobic rather than a pluralistic culture. If you were malnourished as a fetus. If you have
particular variants of genes related to empathy, reactive aggression, anxiety, and responses to
ambiguity. All things over which you had no control. All things that sculpted the amygdala you will have
in this instant of being exposed to a stereotype. All the way down to how many molecules of camp
each neuron releases. How tight the brakes are on pKa. And so on. Because there are millions of neurons
involved. With gazillions of synapses. The process is subject to a lifetime of influences that are
staggeringly more complex and nuanced than what goes into conditioning an eye blink or changing how an
aplysia protects its gill. But it's all the same mechanistic building blocks that will determine whether
your views will be changed by some demagogue's toxic attempt to form a conditioned association in you.
Time to finally move to the sort of split in the road that this book is ultimately about.
Examining the biology of our moral behaviors being changed rather than of our freely choosing
to change our behaviors.
Speeding up and slowing down.
I'm driving down the freeway. I pass a car or truck here or there. Some pass me. I'm listening to music.
And then a guy passes in a sensible electric car that I note as one of those
commit-random-acts-of-kindness bumper stickers.
In the next few seconds, I probably have the micro-expressive start of a smile,
along with a number of thoughts.
Well, that's nice.
I bet I would like the guy.
I wonder who he is.
I bet he has an organ donor sticker on his driver's license.
And then I tease myself for having such a macabre thought.
I think that he no doubt listens to NPR.
Then I think how ironic it would be if he were on his way to rob a bank.
And then something on the radio catches my attention.
And I go back to listening, thinking about something else.
Then, about 30 seconds later, the car ahead of me to the right
signals that it wants to merge into my lane.
Being a jerk, I think,
Oh, no, you don't.
I'm in a rush.
And I'm just about to put my foot on the gas
when I briefly flash on the bumper sticker.
I stop from pressing the accelerator.
And half a second later,
I shift my foot to the brake,
allowing that car to merge,
briefly basking in a sense of my profound nobility.
What went on in those seconds after I saw the bumper sticker?
It's deterministic aplysia all the way down.
There's that classic image of us in a moral quandary.
An angel on one shoulder, a devil on the other.
We have a motor output,
the neuron neurons,
that triggers our muscles to push down on the gas.
And on a metaphorical level,
there's neural circuitry whose net output
is to stimulate that neuron,
a do-it signal,
while a different circuit prompts an inhibitory,
don't, slow down instead.
What is the do-it circuit about?
The usual.
The outcome of influences from one second ago
to millions of years ago.
You're hungry.
It was just a mysterious throbbing pain
on the left side of your butt.
And you're briefly worried
that you have left side of your butt cancer
and thus feel entitled to drive selfishly.
You're going to an important meeting
and can't be late.
You've gone a few months
without getting a decent night's sleep.
In middle school way back when,
the tough kids bullied you a lot.
And from that,
you have a vague, unspoken belief
that letting someone merge in front of you
on the highway
equates to your being an inadequate pushover.
It's the time of day
when your testosterone levels are elevated,
thus strengthening the signaling of neurons
in the
I'm a weakling
if I let someone merge in front of me
circuit,
regardless of your sex.
You have this or that variant
of this or that gene.
You're male
and a member of a species
in which there's a moderate
but significant correlation
between male-male competition
and male reproductive success.
All of those push
in the direction of do it.
Meanwhile,
the don't
slow down instead neuron
has its inputs.
You like to think of yourself
as a kind person.
You went to Quaker meetings
for a while in college.
Something in the news this morning
made you feel
slightly less jaundiced
and helpless about the idea
that the incrementalism
of small good acts
can make the world better.
There's that
Christian rock song
that you really like.
to your formless
atheistic embarrassment.
You were raised by parents
who,
each week on the Sabbath,
gave you a dime
to put in the charity box
for an orphanage
and then,
on behalf of the orphans,
hugged you in a way
that you can still feel
sixty years later.
Etc.
The two circuits sit there,
prompting you toward
opposing neurobiological outputs.
At this moment,
the don't slow down instead prompt
has a little more oomph
than usual.
Why?
Because the neurons
activated by that bumper sticker,
still rumbling
in a reverberating loop
that cycles for a minute or so
in what we call
short-term memory,
have added a faint
but decisive voice
that tips the balance
in favor
of the don't circuit.
How did each of those circuits
form to gain
the collective
neurotransmitter-ish power
to influence
our motor output?
By a whole lot of neurons
forming positive
or negative associations
with something or other.
In other words,
a whole lot of neurons
where the likes of
CAMP,
PKA,
or MAP-K
did this or that.
Let's consider
a hypothetical neuronal circuit,
one straight out of the appendix
that introduces
the basics
of the nervous system.
Suppose we have a network
consisting of
two layers of neurons.
See figure 12.17.
Layer 1
consists of neurons
A, B, and C,
while layer 2
consists of neurons
1 through 5.
Note the wiring pattern
in that neuron A
projects to neurons
1 through 3,
neuron B
to neurons
2 through 4,
neuron C
to neurons
3 through 5.
Stated a different way,
neuron 3
gets inputs
from three other neurons,
neurons 2 and 4
from 2,
neurons 1 and 5
a single input each.
Now,
let's give layer 1
some unlikely specializations.
Neuron A
responds to pictures
of Gandhi,
neuron B
to Martin Luther King Jr.,
neuron C
to the Mirabal sisters.
Neurons don't really
come that way,
but let's allow
those three neurons
to stand in
for three complex networks
of specialized recognition.
What is going on
in layer 2?
At one extreme
are neurons 1 and 5.
Each is as specialized
as any of the first layer neurons,
responding to Gandhi
and the Mirabal sisters,
respectively.
How about neuron 3
at the other extreme?
It is a generalist neuron
sitting at the intersection
of knowledge
among the three layer 1 neurons.
What does it know about?
Out of the overlap
of projections
from layer 1
emerges a category
of people
who died
for their beliefs.
Neuron 3
is the neuron
that stores
the overlapping knowledge
and commonality
of those three examples.
Neurons 2 and 4
are also generalist
in this sense,
but are less skillful
in their knowledge,
having only two exemplars each
to fall back on.
You can make
a generalist neuron
with categorical knowledge
even better
with more examples.
It would not be difficult
to imagine layer 1
containing more examples
and neuron 3,
thus at the intersection
of Gandhi,
MLK,
the Mirabal sisters,
plus, say,
Socrates,
Harvey Milk,
St. Catherine of Siena,
Lincoln.
Neuron 3
is that much more knowledgeable
about this category
of people dying
for their beliefs.
Uh-oh!
You have a slightly
irreverent thought,
recognizing that
this network of
Gandhi,
MLK,
the Mirabals,
Socrates,
Harvey Milk,
St. Catherine,
and Lincoln
is just as accurately
described as
concerning people
who have been
the subjects
of biopic movies.
In other words,
the string of examples
in layer 1
could simultaneously
be embedded
A.
along with Sid Vicious
in the biopic movie category
or B.
in the people dying
for their beliefs category,
now including
a great uncle
killed in Normandy,
whose memory
still evokes tears
in his adoring
little sister,
your grandmother,
age 95.
Thus,
the same layer 1 neuron
can be part
of multiple networks.
Forgo Sid Vicious
and add Jesus
to the layer
and,
according to lots
of Earth's humans,
we still have
the category of people
who died
for their beliefs,
as well as being
subjects of biopic films.
Meanwhile,
Gandhi and Jesus
plus Johnny Weissmuller
could project
as a trio
onto a separate
layer 2 array,
coding for guys
in loincloths.
Let's take things
one step further.
See figure 12.21
in the PDF
that accompanies
this audiobook.
To make things easier,
let's ignore
neurons 1,
2,
4,
and 5
from the second layer,
stripping things down
to only the generalist
neuron 3.
So we've got
the Gandhi,
MLK,
and Mirabal neurons
converging on
the number 3,
people who died
for their beliefs
neuron.
Adjacent to it
is another network,
again ignoring
neurons 1,
2,
4,
and 5
for simplicity's sake.
What does neuron A
in this second network
code for?
The time when,
despite being terrified
by heights,
you made yourself
go off that diving board
and felt great
about yourself afterward.
Neuron B
in that second network?
That semester
where you were close
to failing in geometry
early on,
but then worked like mad
and wound up
with a good grade.
Neuron C?
All those times
when you were a kid
when your mother
would tell you
that you could grow up
to be anything
you wanted
if you put your mind
to it.
What is neuron 3
in this second network
about?
A category that can be
roughly framed as
reasons why I feel
a sense of optimism
and agency
about life.
Next to these
is a third network.
Its neuron 3
is about
peace has happened
in some really
unlikely places,
and its layer 1,
ABC neurons,
are the Good Friday
Agreement in Northern Ireland,
the Camp David Accords
between Egypt and Israel,
and the Christmas Truce
of World War I.
Thus,
three adjacent networks,
where neuron 3
in the first network
is about
people have died
for their beliefs,
neuron 3
in the second
is about
why I feel
a sense of optimism
and agency in life,
and neuron 3
in the third
is about
peace has happened
in some really
unlikely places.
And as a final step,
the three different neurons
in turn
form their own
layer 1,
projecting onto
their own
uber 3 neuron.
What's at the top
of this three-layer network?
Some emergent conclusion
along the lines of
things can get better,
there are people
who have heroically
made things better,
even
I can make things better.
There is hope,
yes,
yes,
yes,
this is crazily simplified,
but it's still
an approximation
of how the brain works.
Exemplars converging
on nodes
out of which
emerge the capacity
to categorize
and associate,
each node
being a part
of multiple networks,
serving as a
lower-layer element
in one
while simultaneously
serving as a
higher-layer element
in another,
a central player
in one,
peripheral
in another,
all built
on wiring principles
identical to those
of an aplysia.
And where the events
around us
alter the strengths
of various synapses,
another tyrant
ceases control
in a country
that was crawling
toward democracy,
and a network
like this last one
is weakened
by this counter-example.
You slow down
to let someone
merge into your lane,
and it is strengthened.
There are even loops
where there is feedback,
such that the positive
affective content
of the output
of a hierarchical network
motivates you
to obtain
more exemplars
as inputs.
Hotel Rwanda
was so inspiring
that it made me
start learning
about truth
and reconciliation
commissions,
strengthening it
further.
Change occurring,
accomplished with
the same molecules
that make for
a learned aplysia,
all without invoking
the sort of
willful agency
and freedom
that we intuitively
attribute change to.
You learned about
how experience
changes the nervous
system of an aplysia,
and as a result,
your nervous system
changes.
We don't choose
to change,
but it is abundantly
possible for us
to be changed,
including,
for the better.
Perhaps,
even by listening
to this chapter.
Thirteen.
We really have
done this before.
The preceding chapters
have left us
with a clear path
that every one of us
needs to take
in roughly the following
sequence of events.
Step number one.
You're living a fine life.
There are people
whom you love
and who love you.
Your days are filled
with meaningful activities
and sources of pleasure
and happiness.
Step number two.
Someone does something
unimaginably awful,
violent,
destructive to a loved one.
You are shattered,
bereft of meaning in life.
You barely function,
will never feel pleasure
or feel safe again.
You will never feel love again
because of the lesson
that a loved one
can be ripped from you
like that.
Step number three.
Some scientist
sits you down
and gives you
a PowerPoint presentation
on the biology of behavior,
including violence.
They go on and on
in an irksome manner
about how
we are nothing more
or less than
the sum of biology
over which we had control
and its interactions
with the environmental
circumstances
over which we also
had no control.
Step number four.
You're convinced.
While you hope
the perpetrator
of that nightmarish violence
will be constrained
from ever harming
anyone else,
you immediately
stop hating him,
viewing that
as atavistic bloodlust
incompatible
with our time
and place.
Yeah, right.
The previous chapter
took on the common
misunderstanding
of the upshot
of a deterministic world
without free will.
If everything
is determined,
why can anything change?
Why bother?
After all,
change,
even massive change,
happens all the time.
It seems to turf us
back to our starting
point of faith
in the foundational role
of free will
in the world.
The last chapter's point
was that while change happens,
we do not freely
choose to change.
Instead,
we are changed
by the world around us
and one consequence
of that
is that we are also changed
as to what sources
of subsequent change
we seek.
Hey,
here you are
listening to the next chapter.
And when you consider
the biology
of how behavior changes
and its mechanistic nature
shared across
the animal kingdom,
determinism seems
even more compelling.
Hold hands
with your comrade,
the aplegia,
and march forward
to a better future.
And then a monster
does that unbearable thing
to your loved one,
and all the implications
of the preceding
umpteen pages
seem like sophistry,
vaporized by pain
and hatred.
The purpose of this
and the next chapter
is to explore
the theme
of the second half
of this book.
Namely,
that regardless
of it seeming unimaginable,
we can change
in these realms.
We have done this before,
where we grew
to recognize
the true causes
of something
and,
in the process,
shed hate and blame
and desire
for retribution.
Time after time,
in fact.
And not only
has society
not collapsed,
but it has gotten better.
This chapter
focuses on
two such examples,
the first showing
the arc of such change
stretching over centuries,
the other,
that which has occurred
in most of our lifetimes.
The Falling Sickness
You find yourself
in the middle
of that TV show
everyone was all hot
about the other year.
What was it?
Game of Thrones?
No, not that.
Game of Cuttlefish?
Cuttlefish game?
Squid game.
Yeah, that's it.
You're in it,
playing red light,
green light.
When the light is green,
you run forward,
while as soon as it turns red,
don't move.
Mess up?
You're instantly
gunned down.
Good thing
your nervous system
is handling this
instead of your pancreas.
Green light,
one chunk of your brain
is maximally activated,
while another
is wildly,
energetically silenced.
Red light,
exactly the opposite,
with the transitions
ideally being lightning-fast
and accurate.
Your nervous system
is all about contrasts.
Neurons evolved a great trick
for enhancing contrasts.
When a neuron is silent,
has nothing to say,
its electrical makeup
is at one extreme,
where the inside of the neuron
is negatively charged
relative to the outside.
When the neuron is triggered
into an explosion of excitation
called an action potential,
the inside of the neuron
becomes positively charged.
No confusing nothing to say
with something to say
with this sort of polarization.
Then there's the trick.
The excitation,
that action potential,
is over.
The neuron no longer
has something to say.
At this point,
does that positive charge
slowly start meandering back
to the original negative state?
That sort of slow fading
is fine if you're a bladder cell
without much on your mind.
Instead,
the neuron has a very active mechanism
for the positive charge
crashing back to negative
as quickly as it rose
in the previous thousandth
of a second.
In fact,
to make the
it's all over with signal
even more dramatic,
the charge crashes back
to being even more negative
than the original resting state
for a bit of time,
before reverting back
to the original negative charge.
So,
instead of a normally resting
of theetaan body,
the machine,
the engine.
