you should expect to find that randomly moving particle for the rest of the time,
is back at spot X.
And if at some point after time 0, the particle happens to be in spot Z,
now for the rest of the time, spot Z is where it's most likely to be.
The best predictor of where a randomly moving particle is likely to be
is wherever it is right now.
Take any unit of time, say, one second.
The amount of variability in the particle's movement in the next second
will be as much as during one second a million years from now.
The pattern of movement at time 0 has 0 correlation with time 1 or negative 1.
If it looks as if the particle has moved in a straight line,
get that magnifying glass and look closer,
and you'll see that it isn't really a straight line.
Instead, the particle zigzags, regardless of the scale of magnification.
Because of that zigzagging, when magnified infinitely,
a particle will have moved an infinitely long distance between any two points.
These are stringent features for a particle to qualify as undetermined.
These requirements, especially that spacey Menger sponge business
about something infinitely long fitting into a finite space,
show how capital R, randomness, differs from random channel surfing.
So what does a particle being random have to do with your being
the agentive captain of your fate?
Low rent, randomness, brownie in motion
We start with the Jane and Joe lunch-bucket version of indeterminism,
one that is rarely contemplated at meditation retreats.
Sit in an otherwise dark room that has a shaft of light coming in from a window,
and look at what is being illuminated along the way by the shaft.
That is, not the spot on the wall being lit up,
but the air illuminated between the window and the lit wall.
You'll see minuscule dust particles that are in constant motion,
vibrating, jerking this way or that, behaving randomly.
People, that is, Robert Brown in 1827, had long noted the phenomenon,
but it wasn't until the last century that random, a.k.a. stochastic, movement
was identified to occur among particles suspended in a fluid or gas.
Tiny particles oscillate and vibrate
as a result of being hit randomly by photons of light,
which transfer energy to the particle,
producing the vibratory phenomenon of kinetic energy,
which causes particles to bump into each other randomly,
which causes them to bump into other particles,
everything moving randomly,
the unpredictability of the three-body problem on steroids.
Mind you, this isn't the unpredictability of cellular automata,
where every step is deterministic, but not determinable.
Instead, the state of a particle in any given instant
is not dependent on its state an instant before.
Laplace is vibrating disconsolately in his grave.
The features of such stochasticity were formalized by Einstein in 1905,
his Annus Mirabilis,
when he announced to the world that he was not going to be a patent clerk forever.
Einstein explored the factors that influenced the extent of Brownian motion
of suspended particles,
Note the plural on particles.
Any given particle is random,
and predictability is probabilistic
only on the aggregate level of lots of particles.
One thing that increases Brownian motion is heat,
which increases kinetic energy in particles.
In contrast,
it's decreased when the surrounding fluid or gas environment
is sticky or viscous,
or when the particle is bigger.
Think of this last one this way.
The bigger a particle,
the bigger the bullseye,
the more likely it is to be bumped into
by lots of other particles,
on all its sides,
which increases the odds of all those bumps
cancelling each other out,
and the big particles staying put.
Thus,
the smaller the particle,
the more exciting the Brownian motion that it shows.
While the Great Pyramid of Giza may be vibrating,
it isn't doing it much.
So that's Brownian motion.
Particles bumping into each other randomly.
How does that relate to biology?
A first step towards seeing its relevance to behavior?
Lots, as it turns out.
One paper explores how a type of Brownian motion
explains the distribution of populations
of axon terminals.
Another concerns how copies of the receptor
for the neurotransmitter,
acetylcholine,
randomly aggregate into clusters,
something important to their function.
Another example concerns abnormality in the brain.
Some mostly mysterious factors increase the production
of a weirdly folded fragment
called the beta-amyloid peptide.
If one copy of this fragment
randomly bumps into another one,
they stick together,
and this clump of aggregated protein crud
grows bigger.
These soluble amyloid aggregates
are the most likely killers of your neurons
in Alzheimer's disease.
And Brownian motion helps explain probabilities
of fragments bumping into each other.
I like teaching one example of Brownian motion
because it undermines myths
of how genes determine everything interesting
in living systems.
Take a fertilized egg.
When it divides in two,
there is random Brownian splitting of the stuff
floating around inside,
such as thousands of those powerhouses of the cell,
mitochondria.
It's never an exact 50-50 split,
let alone the same split each time.
Meaning, those two cells
already differ in their power-generating capacity.
Same for vast numbers of copies of proteins
called transcription factors,
which turn genes on or off.
The uneven split of transcription factors
when the cell divides
means the two cells will differ
in their gene regulation,
and with each subsequent cell division,
randomness plays that role
in the production of all those cells
that eventually constitute you.
Now, time to scale up
and see where Brownian-esque randomness
plays into behavior.
Consider some organism,
say, a fish, looking for food.
How does it find food most efficiently?
If food is plentiful,
the fish forages in little forays
anchored around this place of easy eating.
But if food is diffuse and sparse,
the most efficient way to bump into some
is to switch to a random
Brownian foraging pattern
called a levee walk.
So, if you're the only thing worth eating
in the middle of the ocean,
the predator that grabs you
will probably have gotten there
by a levee walk.
And, logically,
many prey species move randomly
and unpredictably
in evading predators.
The same math describes
another type of predator
hunting for prey,
a white blood cell
searching for pathogens
to engulf.
If the cell is in the middle
of a cluster of pathogens,
it does the same sort of
home-based forays
as a killer whale
feasting in the middle
of a bunch of seals.
But when the pathogens are sparse,
white blood cells switch
to a random levee walk
hunting strategy,
just like a killer whale.
Biology is the best.
To summarize,
the world is filled
with instances
of indeterministic
Brownian motion,
with various biological phenomena
having evolved
to optimally exploit
versions of this randomness.
Are we talking
free will here?
Before addressing
this question of free will,
time to face the inevitable
and tackle the mother
of all theories.
Quantum Indeterminacy
Here goes.
The classical physical picture
of how the universe works,
invariably attributed
to Newton,
tanked in the early
20th century
with the revolution
of quantum indeterminacy.
And nothing has been
the same since.
The subatomic world
turns out to be
deeply weird
and still can't be
fully explained.
I'll summarize here
the findings that are
most pertinent
to free will believers.
Wave
slash
particle
duality
The start of the most
foundational weirdness
was the immeasurably cool
landmark
double-slit experiment
first carried out
by Thomas Young
in 1801.
Another one of those
polymaths who,
when he wasn't busy
with physics
or outlining the biology
of how color vision works,
helped translate
the Rosetta Stone,
shoot a beam of light
at a barrier
that has two vertical
slits in it.
Behind it
is a wall
that can detect
where the light
is hitting it.
This shows that
the light travels
through the two slits
as waves.
How is this detected?
If there was a wave
emanating from each slit,
the two waves
would wind up overlapping.
And there's a
characteristic signature
when a pair of waves
does this.
When the peaks
of two waves converge,
you get an immensely
strong signal.
When the troughs
of the two converge,
the opposite.
When a peak
and a trough meet,
they cancel
each other out.
Surfers understand this.
So,
light travels
as a wave,
classical knowledge.
Shoot a stream
of electrons
at the double-slit barrier,
and there's
the same punchline,
a wave function.
Now,
shoot one electron
at a time,
recording where it
hits the detector wall,
and the individual electron,
the individual particle,
passes through
as a wave.
Yep,
the single electron
passes through
both slits simultaneously.
It's in two places
at once.
Turns out that it's
more than just
two places.
The exact location
of the electron
is indeterministic,
distributed probabilistically
across a cloud
of locations at once,
something termed
superposition.
Accounts of this
now usually say
something to the effect
of,
now things get weird,
as if a single particle
being in multiple places
at once
weren't weird.
Now things get weirder.
Build a recording device
into the double-slit wall
to document the passage
of each electron.
You already know
what will happen.
Each individual electron
passes through
both slits at once
as a wave.
But no,
each electron
now passes through
one slit
or the other
randomly.
The mere process
of measuring,
documenting what happens
at the double-slit wall,
causes the electrons,
and as it turns out,
streams of light
made up of photons,
to stop acting
as waves.
The wave function
collapses,
and each electron
passes through
the double-slit wall
as a singular particle.
Thus,
electrons and photons
show particle-slash-wave
duality,
with the process
of measurement
turning waves
into particles.
Now measure the properties
of the electron
after it passes
through the slits,
but before it hits
the detector wall.
And as a result,
each electron
passes through
one of the slits
as a single particle.
It knows
that it is going
to be measured
in a bit,
which collapses
its wave function.
Why the process
of measuring
collapses wave functions,
the measurement problem,
remains mysterious.
To jump ahead
for a moment,
you can guess
that things are going
to get very new-agey
if you assume
that the macroscopic world,
big things like, say,
you,
also works this way.
You can be
in multiple places
at once.
You are nothing
but potential.
Merely observing
something
can change it.
Your mind
can alter
the reality
around it.
Your mind
can determine
your future.
Heck,
your mind
can change your past.
More jabberwocky
to come.
Particle-slash-wave
duality
generates
a key implication.
When an electron
is moving past
a spot
as a wave,
you can know
its momentum,
but you obviously
can't know
its exact location
since it's
indeterministically
everywhere.
And once
the wave function
collapses,
you can measure
where that particle
now is,
but you can't
know its momentum
since the process
of measurement
changes everything
about it.
Yep,
it's Heisenberg's
uncertainty principle.
The inability
to know
both location
and momentum,
the fact
of superposition
and things
being in multiple
places at once,
the impossibility
of knowing
which slit
an electron
will pass through
once a wave
has collapsed
into a particle,
all introduce
a fundamental
indeterminism
into the universe.
Einstein,
despite upending
the reductive,
deterministic world
of Newtonian physics,
hated this type
of indeterminism,
famously declaring,
God does not
play dice
with the universe.
This began
a cottage industry
of physicists
trying to slip
some form
of determinism
in the back door.
Einstein's version
is that the system
actually is deterministic,
thanks to some
still undiscovered
factor,
or factors,
and things will go back
to making sense
once this hidden variable
is identified.
Another back door move
is the very opaque
many-world idea,
which posits
that waves
don't really
collapse
into a singularity.
Instead,
their waveness
continues
in an infinite
number of universes,
making for a
completely deterministic
world,
or worlds.
And it just
looks singular
if you're looking
from only one universe
at a time.
I think.
My sense is
that the hidden
variable dodge
is most doubters'
favorite.
However,
the majority
of physicists
accept the
indeterministic picture
of quantum mechanics,
known as
the Copenhagen
interpretation,
reflecting its
being championed
by the Copenhagen-based
Niels Bohr.
In his words,
those who are not
shocked when they
first come across
quantum theory
cannot possibly
have understood it.
Entanglement
and non-locality
Next Weirdness
Two particles,
say two electrons
in different shells
of an atom,
can become
entangled,
where their properties,
such as their
direction of spin,
are linked
and perfectly
correlated.
The correlation
is always
negative.
If one electron
spins in one direction,
its coupled partner
spins the opposite way.
Fred Astaire
steps forward
with his left leg,
Ginger Rogers
steps back
where they're right.
But it's
stranger than that.
For starters,
the two electrons
don't have to be
in the same atom.
They can be
a few atoms apart.
Okay,
sure.
Or,
it turns out,
it can be
even farther apart.
The current record
is particles
nearly 900
miles apart
at two ground
stations linked
by a quantum
satellite.
Moreover,
if you alter
the property
of one particle,
the other
changes as well,
employing a causality
that isn't local.
There is no
theoretical limit
for how far apart
entangled particles
can be.
An electron
in the Crab Nebula
in the constellation
Taurus
can be entangled
with an electron
in the piece
of broccoli
stuck between
your incisors.
And as the
strangest feature,
when the state
of one particle
is altered,
the complementary
change in the
other occurs
instantaneously,
meaning that
the broccoli
and crab
nebula
are influencing
each other
faster than
the speed
of light.
Einstein
was not
amused
and labeled
the phenomenon
with a sarcastic
German equivalent
of spooky.
In 1935,
he and two
collaborators
published a paper
that challenged
the possibility
of this
instantaneous
entanglement,
again positing
hidden variables
that explained
things without
invoking
faster than
the speed
of light
mojo.
In the 1960s,
the Irish
physicist
John Stuart
Bell
showed that
there was
something off
in the math
in that paper
of Einstein's.
And in the
decades since,
extraordinarily
difficult
experiments,
like the one
with that
satellite,
have confirmed
that Bell
was right
when he said
that Einstein
was wrong
when he said
that the
interpretation
of entanglement
was wrong.
In other words,
the phenomena
is for real,
although it still
remains basically
unexplained,
nonetheless
generating
highly accurate
predictions.
Since then,
scientists have
explored the
potential of
using quantum
entanglement
in computing,
with people at
Apple apparently
making significant
progress,
in communication
systems,
maybe even
in automatically
receiving a
widget from
Amazon the
instant you
think that
you'll be
happier owning
one.
And the
weirdness just
won't stop.
Entanglement
over long
enough distances
can also
show non-locality
over time.
Suppose you
have two
entangled
electrons a
light year
apart,
alter one of
them,
and the other
particle is
altered at the
same instant,
a year ago.
Scientists
have also shown
quantum entanglement
in living
systems,
between a
photon and
the photosynthetic
machinery of
bacteria.
You better
bet that we've
got free will
speculations
coming that
invoke time
travel,
entanglement
between neurons
in the same
brain,
and as long
as we're at
it,
between brains.
Quantum
Tunneling
This one is a
piece of cake
conceptually,
after all the
preceding
strangeness.
Shoot a
stream of
electrons at
a wall.
As we know,
each travels
as a wave,
superposition
dictating that
until you
measure its
location,
each electron
is probabilistically
in numerous
places at
once,
including the
really,
really unlikely
but theoretically
possible outcome
of one of
those numerous
places being
on the other
side of the
wall,
because the
electron has
tunneled through
it.
And as it
turns out,
this can
happen.
That's it for
this pitiful
tour of
quantum
mechanics.
For our
purposes,
the main
points are
that in the
view of most
of the
savants,
the subatomic
universe works
on a level
that is
fundamentally
indeterministic
on both an
ontic and
epistemic
level.
Particles can
be in multiple
places at
once,
can communicate
with each
other over
vast distances
faster than
the speed
of light,
making both
space and
time
fundamentally
suspect,
and can
tunnel through
solid objects.
As we'll
now see,
that's plenty
enough for
people to
run wild
when proclaiming
free will.
10.
Is your
free will
random?
Quantum
orgasmicness.
Attention and
intention are
the mechanics
of manifestation.
The previous
chapter revealed
some truly
weird things
about the
universe that
introduce a
fundamental
indeterminism into
the proceedings.
And from
virtually the
first moment
this news got
around, some
believers in
free will have
attributed all
sorts of mystical
gibberish to
quantum mechanics.
There are now
proponents of
quantum
metaphysics,
quantum
philosophy,
quantum
psychology,
there's
quantum
theology,
and quantum
Christian
realism.
In one
tract in
that vein,
quantum
mechanics is
cited as
proving that
humans cannot
be reduced to
predictable
machines,
making for
human uniqueness
that aligns
with the
biblical claim
that God
loves each
person in a
unique manner.
For the
I don't
believe in
organized religion
but I'm a
very spiritual
person crowd,
there's
quantum
spirituality
and
quantum
mysticism.
Then there's
new age
entrepreneur
Deepak Chopra
who in his
1989 book
Quantum
Healing
promises a
pathway to
curing cancer,
reversing aging,
and,
heavens to
Betsy,
even
immortality.
There's
quantum
activism,
which, as
espoused by a
new age
physicist in
his seminars,
is the idea
of changing
ourselves and
our societies
in accordance
with the
principles of
quantum physics.
There's
quantum cognition,
spin-mediated
consciousness,
quantum
neurophysics,
and, wait
for it, a
nebulous
Cartesian
system of
oscillations and
quantum dynamics,
explaining our
freely choosing
brains.
And as a
branch that
particularly gets
under my skin,
there's quantum
psychotherapy,
a field where
one paper proposes
that clinical
depression is
rooted in
quantum abnormalities
in the fatty acids
found in the
membranes of
platelet cells.
Gain hope from
the knowledge that
there are folks
pursuing this
angle to help
you, should you
feel suffocatingly
sad day after
day.
Meanwhile, the
same journal
contains a paper
aiming to aid the
treatment of
schizophrenia
sufferers,
entitled
Quantum Logic
of the
Unconscious and
Schizophrenia,
in which quantum
comprises 9.6%
of the words in
the paper's
abstract.
I'm not gonna
lie, I'm not a
big fan of folks
touting crap like
this concerning
people in pain.
The nonsense
has some
consistent themes.
There's a notion
that if particles
can be entangled
and communicate
with each other
instantaneously,
there is a
unity, a
oneness, that
connects all
living things
together, including
all humans, except
for people who
are mean to
dolphins or
elephants.
The time-travel
spookiness of
entanglement can
be hijacked with
the idea that
there is no
unfortunate event
in your past
that cannot, in
theory, be gone
back to and
fixed.
There's the
theme that if
you can supposedly
collapse a quantum
wave just by
looking at it, you
can achieve nirvana
or go into the
boss's office and
get a raise.
According to the
same New Age
physicist, the
material world
around us is
nothing but
possible movements
of consciousness.
I am choosing,
moment by
moment, my
experience.
There is also
the usual trope
that whatever
quantum physicists
found out with
their high-tech
gizmos, merely
confirms what was
already known by
the ancients.
Lotus positions
galore.
And near-villainous
anti-grooviness
comes from
materialists with
their classical
physics.
These elitists who
dictate people's
experiences of
meaning.
All this infinite
potential is one
big blowout salute
to the renowned
New Age healer
Mary Poppins.
Some problems here
are obvious.
These papers,
which are typically
unvetted and
unread by
neuroscientists,
are published in
journals that
scientific indexes
won't classify as
scientific journals,
that is,
neuroquantology,
and are written by
people not
professionally trained
to know how the
brain works.
But now and then,
one's critique of
this thinking has to
accommodate someone
who knew how the
brain works,
bringing us to the
challenging case of
the Australian
neurophysiologist
John Eccles.
He wasn't just a
good or even a
great scientist.
He was Sir John,
Nobel laureate,
who pioneered
understanding in the
1950s of how
synapses work.
Thirty years later,
in his book,
How the Self
Controls Its Brain,
Springer Verlag,
1994,
Eccles posited
that the mind
produces
psychons,
that is,
fundamental units
of consciousness,
a term previously
mostly used in
cheesy science fiction,
which regulate
dendrons,
that is,
functional units
of neurons,
through quantum
tunneling.
He didn't merely
reject materialism
in favor of
dualism.
He declared
himself a
trialist,
making room for
the category of
soul-slash-spirit,
which freed the
human brain from
some of the laws
of the physical
universe.
In his book,
Evolution of the
Brain,
Creation of the
Self,
Routledge,
1989,
An Unironic
Amalgam of
Spirituality and
Paleontology,
Eccles tried to
pinpoint when this
uniqueness first
evolved,
which hominin
ancestor gave birth
to the first
organism with a
soul.
He also believed
in ESP and
psychokinesis,
querying new lab
members whether
they shared these
beliefs.
By my student
days, the
mention of
Eccles with
his religious
mysticism and
embrace of the
paranormal elicited
nothing but
eye-rolling.
As a scathing
New York Times
review of
Evolution of the
Brain concluded,
Eccles' descent
into spirituality
invited Ophelia's
lament for
Hamlet,
Oh, what a
noble mind is
here overthrown!
Obviously, it's
not sufficient for
me to reject the
idea that quantum
indeterminacy is
an opening for
free will merely
by citing the
paucity of
neuroscientists
thinking this
way, or by
performing the
dirge for
Eccles.
Time to examine
what I see as,
collectively, three
fatal problems with
the idea.
Problem number
one.
Bubbling up.
The starting point
here is the idea
that quantum
effects, down
there at the
level of
electrons
entangling with
each other,
will affect
biology.
There is
precedent for
this concerning
photosynthesis.
In that realm,
electrons that
have been excited
by light are
impossibly efficient
at finding the
fastest way to
move from one
part of a plant
cell to another,
seemingly because
each electron does
this by being in
a quantum
superposition
state, checking
out all the
possible roots at
once.
So, that's
plants.
Trying to pull
free will out of
electrons in the
brain is the
immediate challenge.
Can quantal
effects bubble
upward, amplify
in their effects,
so that they can
influence gigantic
things, like a
single molecule, or
a single neuron, or
a single person's
moral beliefs?
Nearly everyone
thinking about the
subject concludes that
it cannot happen,
because, as we'll
soon cover, quantal
effects get washed
out, cancel each
other out in the
noise, the waves
of superposition
decohere.
As summarized
nicely by the
title of a book by
physicist David
Lindley, Where
Does the Weirdness
Go?
Why Quantum
Mechanics is
Strange, but Not
as Strange as
You Think.
Basic Books,
1996.
Nonetheless, people
linking quantum
indeterminacy with
free will, argue
otherwise.
Their challenge is
to show how any
building block of
neuronal function is
subject to quantum
effects.
One possibility is
explored by Peter
Tsi, who considers
the neurotransmitter
glutamate, where the
workings of one of its
receptors requires
popping a single
atom of magnesium
out of an ion
channel that it
blocks.
In Tsi's view, the
location of the
magnesium can change
in the absence of
antecedent causes
because of indeterminate
quantal randomness, and
these effects bubble up
further.
The brain has in fact
evolved to amplify
quantum domain
randomness up to a
level of neural spike
timing randomness, my
emphasis.
That is, up to the
level of individual
neurons being
indeterminate, and the
consequences then
ripple upward further
into circuits of
neurons, and beyond.
Other advocates have
also focused on
quantal effects occurring
at a similar level, as
captured in one book's
title, Chance in
Neurobiology, From
Ion Channels to the
Question of Free Will.
Psychiatrist Jeffrey
Schwartz of UCLA views
the level of single
ion channels and ions as
fair game for quantal
effects.
This extreme smallness of
the opening in the
calcium ion channels has
profound quantum
mechanical implications.
Biophysicist Ali Pasha
Viziri of Rockefeller
University examines the
role of non-classical
physics in determining
which type of ion flows
through a particular
channel.
In the views of
anesthesiologist Stuart
Hammerhoff and
physicist Roger Penrose,
consciousness and free
will arise from a
different part of neurons.
Namely, microtubules.
To review, neurons send
axonal and dendritic
projections all over the
brain.
This requires a transport
system within these
projections to, for
example, deliver the
building blocks for new
copies of neurotransmitter
or neurotransmitter
receptors.
This is accomplished with
bundles of transport tubes,
microtubules, inside
and projections.
This was briefly touched
on in Chapter 7.
Despite some evidence that
they can themselves be
informational,
microtubules are mostly
like the pneumatic tubes
in office buildings circa
1900, where someone in
accounting could send a
note in a cylinder
downstairs to the folks in
marketing.
Hammerhoff and Penrose,
with papers with titles
such as How Quantum
Biology Can Rescue
Conscious Free Will,
focus in on microtubules.
Why?
In their view, the
tightly packed, fairly
stable, parallel
microtubules are ideal for
quantum entanglement
effects among them.
And it's on to free will
from there.
This strikes me as akin to
hypothesizing that the
knowledge contained in a
library emanates not from
the books, but from the
little carts used to
transport books around for
reshelving.
Hammerhoff and Penrose's
ideas have gained particular
attraction among quantum
free willers, no doubt in
part because Penrose won the
Nobel Prize in Physics for
work concerning black
holes and also authored the
1989 bestseller The
Emperor's Mind, concerning
computers, minds, and the
laws of physics.
Oxford University Press.
Despite this firepower,
neuroscientists, physicists,
mathematicians, and
philosophers have pilloried
these ideas.
MIT physicist Max
Tegmark showed that the
time course of quantum
states in microtubules is
many, many orders of
magnitude shorter lived than
anything biologically
meaningful.
In terms of the discrepancy in
scale, Hammerhoff and
Penrose are suggesting that
the movement of a glacier over
the course of a century could
be significantly influenced by
random sneezes among nearby
villagers.
Others pointed out that the
model depends on a key
microtubule protein having a
conformation that doesn't
occur, on types of
intercellular connections that
don't happen in the adult
brain, and on an organelle in
neurons being in a place where
it isn't.
So, this savaging aside, can
quantum effects actually bubble up
enough to influence behavior?
The indeterminacy that releases
magnesium from a single
glutamate receptor doesn't
enhance excitation across a
synapse all that much.
An even major excitation of a
single synapse is not enough to
trigger an action potential in a
neuron.
And an action potential in one
neuron is not enough to make a
signal propagate through a
network of neurons.
Let's put some numbers behind
these facts.
The dendrite in a single
glutamatergic synapse contains
approximately 200 glutamate
receptors.
And remember that we're
considering quantal events in a
single receptor at a time.
A neuron has, conservatively,
10,000 to 50,000 of those
synapses.
Just to pick a brain region at
random, the hippocampus has
approximately 10 million of those
neurons.
That's 20 to 100 trillion
glutamate receptors.
200 times 10,000 times 10 million
equals 20 trillion.
And 200 times 50,000 times 10 million
equals 100 trillion.
It is possible that an event having
no prior deterministic cause could
alter the functioning of a single
glutamate receptor.
But how likely is it that
quantum events like these just
happen to occur at the same time
and in the same direction, that is,
increasing or decreasing receptor
activation, in enough of those 20 to
100 trillion receptors to produce an
actual neurobiological event that has no
prior deterministic cause?
Apply some similar numbers in the
hippocampus to those putative
consciousness-producing microtubules.
Their basic building block, a
protein called tubulin, is 445 amino
acids long, and amino acids average
out to close to 20 atoms each.
Thus, around 9,000 atoms in each
molecule of tubulin.
Each stretch of microtubule is made up
of 13 tubulin molecules.
Each stretch of axon contains about
100 bundles of microtubules, each
axon helping to make the 10,000 to
50,000 synapses in each of those 10
million neurons.
Again, with the zeros.
This is the bubbling up problem and
going from quantum indeterminacy at the
subatomic level up to brains producing
behavior.
You'd need to have a staggeringly large
number of such random events occurring
at the same time, place, and direction.
Instead, most experts conclude that the
more likely scenario is that any given
quantum event gets lost in the noise of
a staggering number of other quantum
events occurring at different times and
directions.
People in this business view the brain not
only as noisy in this sense, but also as
warm and wet.
The messy sort of living environment that
biases against quantum effects persisting.
As summarized by one philosopher, the law of
large numbers, combined with the sheer number of
quantum events occurring in any macro-level
object, assure us that the effects of random
quantum-level fluctuations are entirely predictable
at the macro-level, much the way that the profits of
casinos are predictable, even though based on millions of
purely chance events.
The early 20th century physicist Paul Ehrenfest, in the
theorem bearing his name, formalizes how as one considers
larger and larger numbers of elements, the non-classical physics of
quantum mechanics merges into old-style predictable
classical physics.
To paraphrase Lindley, this is why the weirdness
disappears.
So, one glutamate receptor does not a moral philosophy
make.
The response to this by quantum free willers is that
various features of non-classical physics can coordinate
quantum events among a lot of constituents in the nervous
system.
And some posit that quantum indeterminacy bubbles up to
some extent and meets chaoticism there, piggybacking all the
way up to behavior.
For Eccles, quantum tunneling across synapses allows for the
coupling of networks of neurons in shared quantum states.
And note that implicit in this idea, and those to follow, is
that entanglement occurs not just between two particles, but
between whole neurons as well.
For Schwartz, quantum superposition means that a single ion flowing
through a channel is not really singular.
Instead, it is a quantum cloud of possibilities associated with the
calcium ion to fan out over an increasing area as it moves away from
the tiny channel to the target region where the ion will be absorbed as
a whole, or not absorbed at all.
In other words, thanks to particle-slash-wave duality, each ion can have
coordinated effects far and wide.
And, Schwartz continues, this process bubbles upward to encompass the whole
brain.
In fact, because of uncertainties on timings and locations, what is generated by
the physical processes in the brain will be not a single discrete set of
non-overlapping physical possibilities, but rather a huge smear of classically
conceived possibilities.
Now subject to quantum rules, Sultan Tarleche and Massimo Pregnolato cite similar
quantum physics in speculating that a single neurotransmitter molecule has a
similar cloud of superposition possibilities, binding to an array of receptors at
once and lassoing them into collective action.
So the notion that random, indeterministic quantum effects can bubble all the way up
to behavior strikes me as a little dubious.
Moreover, nearly all the scientists with the appropriate expertise think it is
resoundingly dubious.
Somewhere around here it seems useful to approach things on a more empirical level.
Do synapses ever actually act, randomly?
How about entire neurons?
Entire networks of neurons?
Neuronal spontaneity
As a brief reminder, when an action potential occurs in a neuron, it goes hurtling down the
axon, eventually reaching all of the thousands of that neuron's axon terminals.
As a result, packets of neurotransmitter are released from each terminal.
If you were designing things, maybe each axon terminal's neurotransmitters would be contained
in a single bucket, a single large vesicle, which would then be emptied into the synapse.
That has a certain logic.
Instead, that same amount of neurotransmitter is stored in a bunch of much smaller buckets,
and all of them are emptied into the synapse in response to an action potential.
Your average hippocampal neuron that releases glutamate as its neurotransmitter has about 2.2
million copies of glutamate molecules stored in each of its axon terminals.
In theory, each terminal could have all of those copies in our single big-bucket vesicle.
Instead, as noted before, the terminal contains an average of 270 little vesicles, each containing
about 8,000 copies of glutamate.
Why has this organization evolved instead of the single-bucket approach?
Probably because it gives you more fine control.
For example, it turns out that a large percentage of vesicles are usually mothballed at the back
end of the terminal, kept in storage for when needed.
Therefore, an action potential doesn't really cause the release of neurotransmitter from
all the vesicles in each axon terminal.
More correctly, it causes releases from all of the vesicles in their readily releasable pool.
And neurons can regulate what percentage of their vesicles are readily releasable versus
in storage, a way of changing the strength of the signal across the synapse.
This was the work of Bernard Katz, who got some of his training with Eccles and went on to
his own knighthood and Nobel Prize.
Katz would isolate a single neuron and, with the use of a particular drug, make it impossible
for it to have an action potential.
He'd then study what would be happening at a given axon terminal.
What he saw was that, amid action potentials being blocked, every now and then, maybe once
a minute, the axon terminal would release a tiny hiccup of excitation, something eventually
called a miniature end-plate potential, MEPP, showing that little bits of neurotransmitter
were spontaneously and randomly released.
Katz noted something interesting.
The hiccups were all roughly the same size, say, 1.3 smidgens of excitation.
Never 1.2 or 1.4.
To the limits of measurement, always 1.3.
And then, after sitting there recording the occasional 1.3 smidgen-sized blip, Katz noticed
that much more rarely than that, there'd be a hiccup that was 2.6 smidgens.
Whoa!
And even more rarely, 3.9 smidgens.
What was Katz seeing?
1.3 smidgens was the amount of excitation of one single vesicle being spontaneously released.
2.6, the much rarer spontaneous release, of two vesicles simultaneously.
And so on.
From that came the insight that neurotransmitters were stored in individual vesicular packets,
and that every now and then, in a purely probabilistic fashion, an individual vesicle would dump its
neurotransmitters, drumroll please, in the absence of an antecedent cause.
While the field has often viewed the phenomenon as not hugely interesting, often referring to it
semi-sarcastically as leaky synapses, the notion of there being no antecedent causes
turned spontaneous vesicular release of neurotransmitter into an amusement park in which
neuroquantologists can gamble.
Aha!
Spontaneous non-deterministic vesicular neurotransmitter release as the building block for the brain
as a cloud of potentials, for being the captain of your fate.
Four reasons to be very cautious about this.
Not so fast with the no-antecedent cause part.
There's a whole cascade of molecules involved in the process of an action potential causing
vesicles to dump their neurotransmitter into the synapse.
Ion channels open or close.
Ion-sensitive enzymes are activated.
A matrix of proteins holding a vesicle, still in its inactive state, has to be cleaved.
A molecular machete has to cut through more matrix to allow the vesicle to then move toward
the neuron's membrane.
The vesicle has to now dock to a specific release portal in the membrane.
The insights of many fruitful careers in science.
Okay, you think you see where I'm going.
Yeah, yeah, neurotransmitter doesn't just get dumped from out of nowhere.
There's this whole complex mechanistic cascade explaining intentional neurotransmitter release.
So we'll reframe our free will as when this deterministic cascade happens to be triggered
in the absence of an antecedent cause.
But no, it's not just when the usual process is triggered randomly, because it turns out
that the mechanistic cascade for spontaneous vesicular release is different from the cascade
for release evoked by an action potential.
It's not a random universe hitting a button that normally represents intent.
A separate button evolved.
Moreover, the process of spontaneous vesicular release is regulated by factors extrinsic to
the axon terminal.
Other neurotransmitters, hormones, alcohol, having a disease like diabetes, or having a particular
visual experience can all alter spontaneous release without having a similar effect on evoked
neurotransmitter release.
Events in your big toe can change the likelihood of these hiccups happening in the axon terminal
of some neuron in the corner of your brain.
How would, say, a hormone do this?
It sure wouldn't be changing the fundamental nature of quantum mechanics.
Ever since puberty and hormones hit, all I get from her is sullenness and quantum entanglement.
But, a hormone can alter the opportunity for quantum events to occur.
For example, many hormones change the composition of ion channels, changing how subject they are
to quantum effects.
Thus, deterministic neurobiology can make indeterministic randomness more or less likely to occur.
It's like you're the director of a show, where, at some point, the new king emerges, to much
acclaim.
And, as your direction, you tell the twenty people in the ensemble,
OK, when the king appears from stage left, shout out stuff like,
Hurrah!
Behold the king!
Long life, sire!
Huzzah!
Just pick one of those.
And you're pretty much guaranteed to get the melange of responses you were aiming for.
Determined Indeterminacy
This certainly does not count as randomness being an uncaused cause.
Spontaneous vesicular release of neurotransmitters serves a useful purpose.
If a synapse has been silent for a while, the likelihood of spontaneous release increases.
The synapse gets up and stretches a bit.
It's like, during a long period at home, running the car occasionally to keep the battery from dying.
In addition, spontaneous neurotransmitter release plays a large role in the developing brain.
It's a good idea to excite a newly wired synapse a bit.
Make sure everything is working right, before putting it in charge of, say, breathing.
Finally, there's still the bubbling up problem.
The bubbling issue brings us to our next level.
So, individual vesicles randomly dump their contents now and then, ignoring for the moment,
the issues of its involving unique machinery, being intentionally regulated, and being purposeful.
Do enough vesicles ever get dumped all at once, to make a major burst of excitation in a single synapse?
Unlikely.
An action potential evokes about 40 times the excitation, as does the spontaneous dump, of a single vesicle.
You'd need a lot of those hiccups at once to produce this.
Scaling up one step higher, do neurons ever just randomly have action potentials,
dumping vesicles in all 10,000 to 50,000 axon terminals, seemingly in the absence of an antecedent cause?
Now and then.
Have we now leapfrogged up to a more integrated level of brain function that could be subject to quantum effects?
The same caution is called for again.
Such action potentials have their own mechanistic antecedent causes, are regulated extrinsically, and serve a purpose.
As an example of the last point, neurons that send their axon terminals into muscles, stimulating muscle movement,
will have spontaneous action potentials.
It turns out that when the muscle has been quiet for a while,
a part of it, called the muscle spindle, can make the neurons more likely to have spontaneous action potentials.
When you've been still for a long while, your muscles get twitchy, just so the battery doesn't run down.
Another case where a mechanistic, deterministic regulatory loop can make indeterministic events more likely.
Again, we'll get to what to make of such determined indeterminacy.
One level higher.
Do entire networks, circuits of neurons, ever activate randomly?
People used to think so.
Suppose you're interested in what areas of the brain respond to a particular stimulus.
Stick someone in a brain scanner and expose them to that stimulus, and see what brain regions activate.
For example, the amygdala tends to activate in response to seeing pictures of scary faces,
implicating that brain region in fear and anxiety.
And then analyzing the data, you would always have to subtract out the background level of noisy activity in each brain region,
in order to identify what was explicitly activated by the stimulus.
Background noise.
Interesting term?
In other words, when you're just lying there, doing nothing,
there's all sorts of random burbling going on throughout the brain.
Once again, begging for an indeterminacy interpretation.
Until some mavericks, principally Marcus Raquel of Washington University's School of Medicine,
decided to study the boring background noise.
Which, of course, turns out to be anything but that.
There's no such thing as the brain doing nothing.
And is now known as the default mode network.
And, no surprise by now, it has its own underlying mechanisms,
is subject to all sorts of regulation, serves a purpose.
One such purpose is really interesting because of its counterintuitive punchline.
Ask subjects in a brain scanner what they were thinking at a particular moment.
And the default network is very active when they are daydreaming,
a.k.a. mind-wandering.
The network is most heavily regulated by the DLPFC.
The obvious prediction now would be that the uptight DLPFC inhibits the default network,
gets you back to work when you're spacing out thinking about your next vacation.
Instead, if you stimulate someone's DLPFC,
you increase activity of the default network.
An idle mind isn't the devil's playground.
It's a state that the most superegoish part of your brain asks for now and then.
Why?
Speculation is that it's to take advantage of the creative problem-solving that we do when mind-wandering.
What is to be made of these instances of neurons acting spontaneously?
Back once again to the show-me scenario.
If free will exists, show me a neuron, or neurons,
that just caused a behavior to occur in the complete absence of any influences coming from other neurons.
From the neuron's energy state, from hormones,
from any environmental events stretching back through fetal life, from genes.
On and on.
None of the versions of ostensibly spontaneous activation of a single vesicle,
synapse, neuron, or neuronal network, constitutes an example of this.
None are truly random events that could be directly rooted in quantum effects.
Instead, they are all circumstances where something very mechanistic in the brain
has determined that it's time to be indeterministic.
Whatever quantum effects there are in the nervous system,
none bubble up to the level of telling us anything about someone
pulling a trigger heartlessly or heroically.
Problem number two.
Is your free will a smear?
Which brings us to the second big problem with the idea
that quantum mechanics means that our macroscopic world
cannot actually be deterministic and free will is alive and well.
Rather than the technicalities of leaky synapses,
muscle spindles, and quantumly entangled vesicles,
this problem is simple, and in my opinion, devastating.
Suppose there were no issues with bubbling,
indeterminacy at the quantum level was not cancelled out in the noise,
and, instead, shaped macroscopic events
dozens of orders of magnitude larger in size.
Suppose the functioning of every part of your brain,
as well as your behavior,
could most effectively be understood on the quantum level.
It's difficult to imagine what that would look like.
Would we each be a cloud of superimposition,
believing in 50 mutually contradictory moral systems at the same time?
Would we simultaneously pull the trigger and not pull the trigger
during the liquor store stick-up?
And only when the police arrive,
would the macrowave function collapse
and the clerk be either dead or not?
This raises a fundamental problem that screams out,
one that every stripe of scholar thinking about this topic
typically wrestles with.
If our behavior were rooted in quantum indeterminacy,
it would be random.
In his influential 2001 essay,
Free Will is a Problem in Neurobiology,
philosopher John Searle wrote,
Quantum indeterminism gives us no help
with the free will problem
because that indeterminism introduces randomness
into the basic structure of the universe,
and the hypothesis that some of our acts occur freely
is not at all the same as the hypothesis
that some of our acts occur at random.
How do we get from randomness to rationality?
As often pointed out by Sam Harris,
if quantum mechanics actually played a role in supposed free will,
every thought and action would seem to merit the statement,
I don't know what came over me.
Except, I'd add,
you wouldn't actually be able to make that statement
since you'd just be making gargly sounds
because the muscles in your tongue
would be doing all sorts of random things.
As emphasized by Michael Shadlin and Adina Roskies,
whether you believe that free will
is compatible with determinism,
it isn't compatible with indeterminism.
Or, in the really elegant words of one philosopher,
chance is as relentless as necessity.
When we argue about whether our behavior
is the product of our agency,
we're not interested in random behavior,
why there might have been that one time in Stockholm
where Mother Teresa pulled a knife on some guy
and stole his wallet.
We're interested in the consistency of behavior
that constitutes our moral character,
and in the consistent ways in which we try to reconcile
our multifaceted inconsistencies.
We're trying to understand how Martin Luther
would stick to his guns and say,
here I stand, I can do no other,
when ordered to renounce his views by ecumenical thugs
who burns people at the stake as a hobby.
We're trying to understand that lost cause person
who is trying to straighten out their life,
yet makes self-destructive,
impulsive decisions again and again.
It's why funerals so often include a eulogy
from that person's oldest friend,
a historical witness to consistency.
Even when we were in grade school,
she was already the sort of person who,
even if quantum effects bubbled up enough
to make our macro world as indeterministic
as our micro one is,
this would not be a mechanism for free will worth wanting.
That is, unless you figure out a way
where we can supposedly harness the randomness
of quantum indeterminacy
to direct the consistencies of who we are.
Problem number three.
Harnessing the randomness of quantum indeterminacy
to direct the consistencies of who we are.
Which is precisely what is argued
by some free will believers
leaning on quantum indeterminacy.
In the words of Daniel Dennett
in describing this view,
whatever you are,
you can't influence the undetermined event.
The whole point of quantum indeterminacy
is that such quantum events
are not influenced by anything.
So you will somehow have to co-opt it
or join forces with it,
putting it to use in some intimate way.
My emphasis.
Or in the words of Peter Tsi,
your brain would have to be able
to harness this randomness
to fulfill information processing aims.
I see two broad ways of thinking
about how we might harness,
co-opt,
and join forces with randomness
for moral consistency.
In a filtering model,
randomness is generated indeterministically,
the usual,
but the agentic U
installs a filter up top
that allows only some of the randomness
that has bubbled up
to pass through and drive behavior.
In contrast,
in a messing-with model,
your agentic self
reaches all the way down
and messes with the quantum indeterminacy itself
in a way that produces the behavior
supposedly chosen.
Filtering
Biology provides at least
two fantastic examples
of this sort of filtering.
The first is evolution.
The random physical chemistry
of mutations occurring in DNA
provides genotypic variety,
and natural selection
is then the filter
choosing which mutations get through
and become more common
in a gene pool.
The other example concerns
the immune system.
Suppose you get infected
with the virus
that your body
has never seen before.
Thus,
there's no antibody against it
in your body's medicine cabinet.
The immune system
now shuffles some genes
to randomly generate
an enormous array
of different antibodies,
at which point,
filtering begins.
Each new type of antibody
is presented
with a piece of the virus
to see how well
the former reacts
to the latter.
It's a Hail Mary pass,
hoping that some of these
randomly generated antibodies
happen to target the virus.
Identify them
and then destroy
the rest of the antibodies,
a process termed
positive selection.
Now check each
remaining antibody type
and make sure
it doesn't happen
to do something dangerous
as well,
namely,
targeting a piece of you
that happens to be similar
to the viral fragment
that was presented.
Check each candidate antibody
against a self fragment.
Find any that attack it
and get rid of them
and the cells
that made them.
Negative selection.
You now have
a handful of antibodies
that target the novel virus
without inadvertently
targeting you.
As such,
this is a three-step process.
One,
the immune system
determines its time
to induce some
indeterministic randomness.
Two,
the random gene
shuffling occurs.
Three,
your immune system
determines which
random outcomes
fit the bill,
filtering out the rest.
Deterministically
inducing a randomization
process,
being random,
using predetermined criteria
for filtering out
the unuseful randomness.
In the jargon
of that field,
this is
harnessing the stochasticity
of hypermutation,
which is what
supposedly goes on
in the filtering version
of quantum effects
generating free will,
in Dennett's words.
The model of decision-making
I am proposing
has the following feature.
When we are faced
with an important decision,
a consideration generator
whose output is
to some degree
undetermined
produces a series
of considerations,
some of which
may of course
be immediately rejected
as irrelevant
by the agent,
consciously or unconsciously.
Those considerations
that are selected
by the agent
as having a more than
negligible bearing
on the decision
then figure in
a reasoning process,
and if the agent
is in the main reasonable,
those considerations
ultimately serve
as predictors
and explicators
of the agent's
final decision.
As such,
determining that you
are at a decision-making
juncture
activates an
indeterministic generator,
and you then
reason through
which consideration
is chosen.
As noted,
Roskies does not
equate the random
noise of nervous systems,
rooted in quantum
indeterminacy or otherwise,
with the headwaters
of free will.
Instead,
for Roskies,
writing with Michael Shadlin,
free will is what's
happening when you
filter out the chaff
from the wheat.
Noise puts a limit
on an agent's
capacities and control,
but invites the agent
to compensate
for these limitations
by high-level decisions
or policies
that may be
A.
consciously accessible,
B.
voluntarily malleable,
and C.
indicative of character.
Filtering,
picking,
choosing as an act
of sufficient free will
and character,
that,
as they state,
this
can provide a basis
for accountability
and responsibility.
Such a harnessing scenario
has at least three limitations
of increasing significance.
A child has fallen
into an icy river,
and your consideration
generator produces
three possibilities
to choose among.
Leap in and save the child,
shout for help,
pretend you didn't see,
and scurry away.
Choose.
But since we're dealing
with quantum indeterminacy,
what if the first
three possibilities are
tango in the absence
of a partner?
Confess to cheating
on your taxes.
Mix squawking sounds
while jumping backward
like the dolphins
at SeaWorld.
Perfectly plausible,
if superpositioned
electron waves
are the wellsprings
from which your moral
decisions flow.
To avoid having
only tangoing,
confessing,
and dolphins
as options,
determine that you need
to indeterminately
generate
every random possibility.
But now you have
to spend a lifetime
evaluating and comparing
each before choosing
which is best.
You need to have
an impossibly efficient
search algorithm.
So,
phew,
generate enough options
so that they aren't
all silly.
Figure out how to
efficiently evaluate
them all,
and then use your criteria
to filter out
all but the winner.
But where does that
filter,
reflecting your values,
ethics,
and character
come from?
It's chapter 3.
And where does intent
come from?
How is it that
one person's filter
filters out
every random possibility
other than
rob the bank,
while another's
goes for
wish the bank teller
a good day?
And where do the values
and criteria come from
in even first deciding
whether some circumstance
merits activating
Dennett's random
consideration generator?
One person might do so
when considering
whether to commence
an act of civil
disobedience
at great personal
cost,
while another would
when making a
fashion decision.
Likewise,
where do the
differences come from
as to which
search algorithm
is used
and for how long?
Where do all
of those come from?
From the events
outside the person's
control,
occurring
one second before,
one minute before,
one hour before,
and so on.
Filtering out
nonsense might
prevent quantum
indeterminacy from
generating random
behavior,
but it sure isn't a
manifestation of free
will.
Messing with
To reiterate,
in a messing with
model,
you don't merely
pick and choose
among the random
quantum effects
generated.
Instead,
you reach down
and alter the
process.
As discussed in
the last chapter,
downward causation
is perfectly valid.
The metaphor
often used
is that when a
wheel is rolling,
its high-level
wheelness is causing
its constituent parts
to do forward
rolls.
And when you
choose to pull a
trigger,
all of your index
finger's cells,
organelles,
molecules,
atoms,
and quarks
move about an
inch.
Thus,
supposedly,
some high-level
me reaches down,
does some
downward causation,
such that
subatomic events
produce free
will.
In the words of
Irish neuroscientist
Kevin Mitchell,
indeterminacy creates
some elbow room.
What randomness
does,
it is posited,
is to introduce
some room,
some causal
slack in the
system,
for higher-order
factors to exert
a causal
influence.
My emphasis.
As a first
problem,
the controlled
randomness,
implicit in
reaching down and
messing with
quantum events,
is as much of
an oxymoron as
determined
indeterminacy.
And where did
the criteria come
from as to how
you're going to
mess with your
electrons?
Amid those
issues,
the biggest
challenge I have
in evaluating
this idea is
that it is
truly difficult
to understand
what exactly
is being
suggested.
One picture
of downward
causation
changing the
ability of
quantum events
to influence
our behavior
is offered
by libertarian
philosopher
Robert Cain,
who,
it will be
recalled from
chapter 4,
suggests that
at times of
life when we
are at a
major crossroads
of decision
making,
the consistent
character at
play,
when we
choose,
was formed
in the past
out of free
will.
That is,
his idea of
self-forming
actions.
But how does
that self-formed
self actually
bring about
that decision?
At such
consequential
crossroads,
there is
tension and
uncertainty in
our minds
about what
to do,
I suggest,
that is
reflected in
appropriate regions
of our brains
by movement
away from
thermodynamic
equilibrium.
In short,
a kind of
stirring up of
chaos in the
brain that
makes it
sensitive to
micro-indeterminacies
at the
neuronal level.
In this view,
your conscious
self uses
downward causation
to induce
neuronal
chaoticism in a
way that
allows quantum
indeterminacy
to bubble
all the way
up in
exactly the
way you've
chosen.
Similar
messing with
comes from
Peter Tsi,
who, as
quoted earlier,
argues that
the brain has
in fact evolved
to amplify
quantum domain
randomness,
and then
speculates that
animals that
had brains
that could do
this procreate
better than
those that
did not.
For him,
the brain
reaches down
and messes
with fundamental
indeterminacy.
This permits
information to
be downwardly
causal regarding
which indeterministic
events at the
root-most level
will be realized.
I am
non-trivially
unsure how
Tsi proposes
this happens.
He wisely
emphasizes how
cause and effect
in the nervous
system can be
conceptualized as
the flow of
information.
But then a
cloud of
dualism comes
in.
For him,
downwardly
causal information
is not
materially real,
which runs
counter to the
fact that in
the brain,
information is
comprised of
real material
things,
like neurotransmitter,
receptor,
and ion-channel
molecules.
Neurotransmitters
bind to particular
receptors for
particular durations.
Chains of proteins
change conformations
such that channels
open or close,
like the locks in
the Panama Canal.
Ions flow like
tsunamis into or
out of cells.
But despite that,
information cannot
be anything like
an energy that
imposes forces.
However, such
information, which
is not causal,
can allow
information that
is causal.
Information is not
causal as a force.
Rather, it is
causal by allowing
those physical
causal chains that
are also
informational causal
chains to
become real.
And while
informational patterns
are not material,
there are physically
realized pattern
detectors.
In other words,
while information
might be made of
immaterial dust,
the brain's
immaterial dust
detectors are made
of reinforced
concrete, steel
rebar, and,
if you're on the
old side,
asbestos.
My problem with
Keynes and
C's views,
and the similar
ones of other
philosophers,
is that, for the
life of me, I
can't figure out
how such reaching
down and messing
with microscopic
indeterminacy in
the brain is
supposed to work.
I can't get past
information being
both of force and
not, without sensing
cake being both
had and eaten.
When Cain writes,
there is tension
and uncertainty in
our minds about
what to do, I
suggest, that is
reflected in
appropriate regions of
our brains by
movement away from
thermodynamic
equilibrium.
I am unclear
whether reflected
is meant to be
causal or
correlative.
Moreover, I
know of no
biology that
explains how
having to make
a tough decision
causes thermodynamic
disequilibrium in
the brain, how
chaoticism can be
stirred up in
synapses, how
chaotic and
non-chaotic
determinism differ
in their sensitivity
in their sensitivity
to quantum
indeterminacy occurring
at a scale many,
many orders of
magnitude smaller.
Whether downward
causality causing
quantum randomness
to fuel the
consistency of one's
choices in life
does so by changing
which electrons
entangle with each
other, how much
non-locality of
time and backward
time travel is
occurring, or whether
the spread of
clouds of
superpositioned
possibilities can be
expanded far enough
so that, in
principle, your
olfactory cortex,
rather than your
motor cortex, sometimes
makes you sign a
check.
It is no longer the
challenge I keep
raising, show me a
neuron that initiates
a complete, coherent
behavior for no
reason whatsoever, and
we can talk seriously
about free will.
Instead, it's, show me
how a neuron
accomplishes this, for
the sorts of reasons
offered by these
scholars.
What we have is a
murky version of
highly unlikely
strong downward
causality.
Please believe me, I
am so trying to not
sound snarky, and to
instead seem
respectful.
I'd certainly come up
with bigger cock-ups
if I hypothesized about
philosophy topics such
as agnotology,
muriology, or the
philosophy of
mathematical
anti-realism.
Nevertheless, it
seems to me that
these free will
advocates are
indignantly saying,
we're not claiming
that quantum
indeterminacy generates
our freely chosen
decisions for no
reason.
We're saying that
quantum indeterminacy
does so for
magical reasons.
Some conclusions.
When people are
suggesting that
fundamental
indeterminacies in
how the universe
works can be the
bases of free will,
responsibility, and
our sacred sense of
agency, only weirdos
are referring to
Brownian motion of
dust particles.
Quantum indeterminacy
is beyond strange,
and in the legendary
words of physics god
Richard Feynman,
if you think you
understand quantum
mechanics, you don't
understand quantum
mechanics.
It is perfectly
plausible, maybe even
inevitable, that there
will be quantum effects
on how things like
ions interact with the
likes of ion channels
or receptors in the
nervous system.
However, there is no
evidence that those
sorts of quantum
effects bubble up
enough to alter
behavior, and most
experts think that it
is actually impossible.
Quantum strangeness is
not that strange, and
quantum effects are
washed away amid the
decohering warm, wet
noise of the brain as
one scales up.
Even if quantum
indeterminacy did bubble
all the way up to
behavior, there is the
fatal problem that all
it would produce is
randomness.
Do you really want to
claim that the free
will for which you
deserve punishment or
reward is based on
randomness?
The supposed ways by
which we can harness,
filter, stir up, or
mess with the
randomness enough to
produce free will seem
pretty unconvincing.
If determined
indeterminism is a
valid building block
for free will, then
taking an improv
acting class is a
valid building block
for, a la sartre,
believing that we are
condemned to be free.
And some conclusions
about the last six
chapters.
Reductionism is great.
It's a whole lot better
to take on a pandemic
by sequencing the gene
for a viral coat
protein than by trying
to appease a vengeful
deity with sacrificial
offerings of goat
intestines.
Nonetheless, it has its
limits, and what the
revolutions of
chaoticism, emergent
complexity, and quantum
indeterminism show, is
that some of the most
interesting things about
us defy pure
reductionism.
This rejection of
reductionism carries all
sorts of subversive,
liberating implications.
That bottom-up
collectivity built on
neighbor-neighbor
interactions and random
encounters can
potentially crush top-down
authoritarian control.
That in such
circumstances, generalists,
rather than specialists,
are most valuable.
That what appears to be a
norm, on closer
examination, is never
actually reached.
Instead, it is reality
oscillating strangely,
aperiodically, around a
platonic ideal.
That this business about
norms applies to being
normal, no matter what the
cool kids say.
There are no actual forms
of perfection that we
fail to reach.
Normal is a not-quite-accurate
descriptor, certainly not
a prescription.
And that, as a point I
emphasize to my students
with ham-hocked
unsubtlety, if you can
explain something of
breathtaking complexity,
adaptiveness, and even
beauty without invoking a
blueprint, you don't have to
invoke a blueprint-maker
either.
But despite the moving
power and these
non-reductive revolutions,
they aren't mother's milk
that nurtures free will.
Non-reductionism doesn't
mean that there are no
component parts, or that
component parts work
differently once there are
lots of them, or that
complex things can fly away
untethered from their
component parts.
A system being
unpredictable doesn't mean
that it is enchanted, and
magical explanations for
things aren't really
explanations.
10.5 Interlude
Why did that behavior,
dastardly, noble, or
ambiguously in between, just
occur?
Because of what happened a
second before, and a
minute before, and a...
The easy takeaway from the
first half of this book is
that the biological
determinants of our
behavior stretch widely over
space and time, responding
to events in front of you
this instant, but also to
events on the other side of
the planet, or that shaped
your ancestors centuries
back.
And those influences are
deep and subterranean, and
our ignorance of the shaping
forces beneath the surface
leads us to fill in the
vacuum with stories of
agency.
Just to restate that
irritatingly familiar-by-now
notion, we are nothing
more or less than the sum
of that which we could not
control, our biology, our
environments, their
interactions.
The most important message
was that these are not all
separate-ology fields
producing behavior.
They all merge into one
evolution-produces genes
marked by the epigenetics of
early environment, which produce
proteins that, facilitated by
hormones in a particular
context, work in the brain to
produce you.
A seamless continuum leaving
note cracks between the
disciplines into which to
slip some free will.
Because of this, as covered in
chapter 2, it doesn't really
matter what Libet-style
experiments do or don't show.
It doesn't really matter when
intent occurred.
All that matters is how that
intent came to be.
We can't successfully wish to
not wish for what we wish for.
We can't announce that good and
bad luck even out over time,
since they're far more likely to
progressively diverge.
Someone's history can't be
ignored, because all we are is
our history.
Moreover, as the point of
chapter 4, it's biological
turtles all the way down with
respect to all of who we are,
not just some parts.
It's not the case that while
our natural attributes and
aptitudes are made of
science-y stuff, our character,
resilience, and backbone come
packaged in a soul.
Everything is turtles all the way
down.
And when you come to a juncture
where you must choose between the
easy way and the harder but
better way, your frontal cortex's
actions are the result of the
exact same one second before,
one minute before, as everything
else in your brain.
It is the reason that, try as we
might, we can't will ourselves to
have more willpower.
Moreover, this seamless continuum of
biology and environment forming us
doesn't leave room for novel portals
of free will by way of the
revolutions of chapters 5 through 10.
Yes, all the interesting things in
the world can be shot through with
chaoticism, including a cell, an
organ, an organism, a society.
And as a result, there are really
important things that can't be
predicted, that can never be
predicted.
But nonetheless, every step in the
progression of a chaotic system is
made of determinism, not whim.
And yes, take a huge number of simple
component parts that interact in
simple ways, let them interact, and
stunningly adaptive complexity
emerges.
But the component parts remain
precisely as simple, and they can't
transcend their biological constraints
to contain magical things like
free will.
A brick may want to be something
elegant and glamorous, but it will
always remain a brick.
And yes, truly indeterministic things
seem to happen way down at the
subatomic level.
Nonetheless, it's not possible for that
level of weirdness to percolate all
the way up to influence behavior.
And besides, if you base your notion
of being a free, willful agent on
randomness, you've got problems.
As do the people stuck around you.
It can be very unsettling when a
sentence doesn't end in the way that
you potato.
Likewise, when behavior is random.
As shown in everyday life, in jury
boxes, school rooms, award ceremonies,
eulogies, and the work of experimental
philosophers, people hold on to the
notion of free will with ferocious
tenacity.
The pull toward attribution and
judgment, whether of others or of
ourselves, is enormous and is
demonstrable, to varying extents, in
cultures all over the world.
Heck, even chimps believe in free will.
Given that, my goal hasn't been to
convince every listener that there is
no free will whatsoever.
I recognize that I'm on the fringe
here, followed traveling with only a
handful of scholars.
That is, Greg Caruso, Sam Harris,
Dirk Peraboom, Peter Strawson.
I'll settle for merely significantly
challenging someone's free will faith.
Sufficiently so that they will reframe
their thinking about both our everyday
lives and our most consequential
moments.
Hopefully, you've reached that point.
Nonetheless, we have a big problem,
which is that amid all this science and
determinism and mechanism, we're still
not very adept at predicting behavior.
Take someone with extensive frontal
cortical damage, and you're on solid
ground predicting that their social
behavior will be inappropriate.
But good luck predicting whether they'll
become an impulsive murderer or someone
who is rude to a dinner host.
Take someone raised in a hellhole of
adversity and deprivation, and you're
pretty safe predicting that the outcome
won't be good, but not much beyond that.
In addition to the unpredictable versions of
predictable outcomes, there are a world's
worth of exceptions, of thoroughly
unpredictable outcomes.
Every so often, two rich, brilliant law
students murder a 14-year-old as a test of
their addled philosophy.
Or a Crips gang member facing his second
stint in jail has his mugshot go viral and
winds up as an international fashion model and
brand ambassador for a Swiss fragrance line.
Squiring around the daughter of a knighted
Brit business mogul.
Maybe Laurie, out among the waving wheat
in Oklahoma, realizes that Curly's a dull
pretty boy and shacks up with Judd Fry.
Will we ever get to the point where our
behavior is entirely predictable, given the
deterministic gears grinding underneath?
Never.
That's one of the points of chaoticism.
But the rate at which we are accruing new
insights into those gears is boggling.
Nearly every fact in this book was discovered in
the last 50 years, probably half in the last five.
The Society for Neuroscience, the world's premier
professional organization for brain scientists, grew
from 500 founding members to 25,000 in its first quarter
century.
In the time it has taken you to listen to this
paragraph, two different scientists have discovered the
function in the brain of some gene and are already squabbling
about who did it first.
Unless the process of discovery in science grinds to a halt
tonight at midnight, the vacuum of ignorance that we tried to
fill with the sense of agency will just keep shrinking.
Which raises the question that motivates the second half of this
book.
I'm sitting at my desk during afternoon office hours.
Two students from my class are asking questions about topics from
lectures.
We wander into biological determinism, free will, the whole
shebang, which is what the course is ultimately about.
One of the students is dubious about the extent to which we lack
free will.
Sure, if there is major damage to this part of the brain, if you
have a mutation in this or that gene, free will is diminished.
But it just seems so hard to accept that it applies to everyday
normal behavior.
I've been at this juncture in this discussion many times, and I've
come to recognize that there is a significant likelihood that the
student will now carry out a particular behavior.
They will lean forward, pick up a pen on my desk, hold it up in the
air, and say to me, with great emphasis,
There.
I just decided to pick up this pen.
Are you telling me that was completely out of my control?
I don't have the data to prove it, but I think I can predict above the
chance level which of any given pair of students will be the one who
picks up the pen.
It's more likely to be the student who skipped lunch and is hungry.
It's more likely to be the male if it is a mixed sex pair.
It is especially more likely if it is a heterosexual male and the female is
someone he wants to impress.
It's more likely to be the extrovert.
It's more likely to be the student who got way too little sleep last night and
it's now late afternoon, or whose circulating androgen levels are higher than
typical for them, independent of their sex.
It's more likely to be the student who, over the months of the class, has
decided that I'm an irritating blowhard, just like their father.
Marching further back, it's more likely to be the one of the pair who is from a
wealthy family, rather than on a full scholarship, who is the umpteenth
generation of their family to attend a prestigious university, rather than the
first member of their immigrant family to finish high school.
It's more likely if they're not a firstborn son.
It's more likely if their immigrant parents chose to come to the U.S. for
economic gain, as opposed to having fled their native land as refugees from
persecution.
More likely if their ancestry is from an individualist culture, rather than a
collectivist one.
It's the first half of this book, providing an answer to their question,
There, I just decided to pick up this pen.
Are you telling me that was completely out of my control?
Yes, I am.
By now, easy.
But I'm really cornered if instead, the student asks something different.
What if everyone started believing that there is no free will?
How are we supposed to function?
Why would we bother getting up in the morning if we're just machines?
Hey, don't ask me that.
That's too difficult to answer.
The second half of this book is an attempt to provide some answers.
11.
Will we run amok?
The notion of running amok has a certain appeal.
Rampaging like a frenzied headless chicken can let off steam.
It's often a way to meet new, interesting people.
Plus, it can be pretty aerobic.
Despite those clear pluses, I haven't been seriously tempted to run amok very often.
It seems kind of tiring, and you get all sweaty.
And I worry that I'll just seem insufficiently committed to the venture and wind up looking silly.
Nevertheless, there has been no shortage of people who have been delighted to run amok,
spittle-flecked, gibbering, and hell-bent on wreaking havoc.
While it can break out at any time, certain circumstances predispose people to run amok,
particularly ones that promise being spared punishment.
Anonymity helps.
During what was officially labeled as a police riot at the 1968 Democratic National Convention,
cops notoriously removed their ID badges before running amok,
beating both peaceful protesters and bystanders,
and destroying film crews' cameras.
In a similar vein, across various traditional cultures,
when warriors are anonymous, for example because of wearing masks,
the odds increase that they will mutilate the corpses of their enemies.
Related to the shield of anonymity, there's,
but everyone else was running amok,
clearly a variant of amok-ing, because you won't get caught.
The last century brought us a subtler path to feeling like you can run amok with impunity,
even if you do so in the glare of the noonday sun.
The excuse given was front and center during the Nuremberg Trials,
as well as among the World War II generation of Germans
trying to explain themselves to their sickened descendants.
The core of,
I was just following orders,
when genocidally running amok,
presupposes a lack of responsibility,
culpability,
or volition.
The direction this is going should be clear this far into the book,
namely the opposite of all those French philosophers
contemplating murdering strangers
to proclaim their existentialist freedom to choose.
If free will is a myth,
and our actions are the mere amoral outcome of biological luck,
for which we are not responsible,
why not just run amok?
The recognition that whatever dreadful thing you do
is not your fault
is at the core of the original running amok.
Meng amok,
the Malaysian-Indonesian word
that spawned the amok of English,
refers to the occasional circumstance
of some peaceful milquetoast
suddenly exploding into inexplicable
and discriminate raging violence.
The traditional interpretation
is one that deftly sidesteps free will.
Through no fault of their own,
the person is believed to be possessed by an evil spirit
and is not held accountable for their actions.
Don't blame me.
I was possessed by Hantu Belian,
the evil tiger spirit of the forest.
It's just a hop, skip, and a jump away from
Don't blame me.
We are just biological machines.
So, if people accept that there is no free will,
will everyone just run amok?
Some research appears to suggest exactly that.
Hard determinists careening through the streets.
To test this,
the experimental approach is simple,
prying people to decrease their belief in free will.
See if they now become jerks.
How to make test subjects doubt free will?
One effective technique
is to have them spend 20 years studying neuroscience,
with some behavior genetics,
evolutionary theory,
and ethology thrown in for good measure.
Impractical.
Instead,
the most common alternative in these studies
is for subjects to read a cogent discussion
about our lack of free will.
Studies have often used a passage
from Francis Crick's 1994 book,
The Astonishing Hypothesis,
The Scientific Search for the Soul.
Scribner.
Crick,
of the Watson and Crick duo
who identified the structure of DNA,
grew fascinated with the brain
and consciousness in his later years.
A hard determinist,
as well as an elegant,
clear writer,
Crick summarizes the scientific argument
for our being merely the sum
of our biological components.
Who you are is nothing but a pack of neurons,
he concludes.
Have subjects read that passage by Crick.
Control subjects read a doctored version
arguing the opposite.
That is,
who you are is much more than just a pack of neurons,
or an excerpt about something dull and unprovocative.
Subjects then fill out a questionnaire
about free will belief.
That is,
how much do you agree with the statement
that people must take full responsibility
for any bad choices that they make?
This is to make sure the manipulation
actually manipulated subjects effectively.
What happens in the brain
when you experimentally diminish people's belief
in free will?
For one thing,
there is a lessening of what is probably best described
as the intentionality or effort
that people put into their actions.
This is shown with using electroencephalography,
EEG,
to monitor brain waves.
Back to the Libet experiment.
When a test subject decides to move her finger,
there is a characteristic wave pattern,
most probably emanating from the motor cortex,
about a half second before.
But the first sign of the impending behavior
is detectable as a wave a few seconds earlier,
termed the early readiness potential.
This seems to arise
in the pre-supplementary motor area,
one step earlier in the circuit leading to movement,
and is interpreted
as a signal of the intentionality
that is going into the subsequent movement.
And recall that as the centerpiece of chapter 2,
Libet reported that the early readiness potential
occurred before people became consciously aware
that they intended to do something.
The endless debates ensue.
When people are made to feel helpless
and with less agency
by being stymied by an unsolvable puzzle,
the size of their early readiness potentials decreases.
And when people are prompted
to believe less in free will,
the same occurs,
with less belief predicting
a greater blunting of the wave,
without changing the size
of the subsequent wave
in the motor cortex itself.
People seem to not be trying as hard,
focusing as hard on the task.
Another characteristic EEG wave,
termed the error-related negativity,
earn signal,
occurs when we realize
we have made a mistake.
This is shown in a go-no-go task
where a computer screen displays
one of two stimuli,
say a red or a green dot,
and you have to quickly push a button
for one caller
and inhibit yourself
from pushing for the other.
The task goes crazy fast,
and when people make a mistake,
there's an earn signal
from the prefrontal cortex.
Aye, I messed up.
And a slight delay
in responding afterward,
as people put more effort
and attention
into getting the right response.
Come on,
I can do better than that.
First induce a sense of helplessness
and inefficacy in subjects,
and they then show
less of an earn wave
and less post-error slowing,
without a change
in the actual error rate.
Prompt people to believe
less in free will,
and you see the same.
Collectively,
these EEG studies
show that when people
believe less in free will,
they put less intentionality
and effort into their actions,
monitor their errors
less closely,
and are less invested
in the outcomes of a task.
Once you're sure
that you've induced
some free will skepticism
in your subjects,
whether assessed by
questionnaire or EEG,
time to let them loose
on the unsuspecting world.
Do they run amok?
Seemingly.
A series of studies
initiated by
behavioral economist
Catherine Vose
of the University of Minnesota
show that free will skeptics
become more antisocial
in their behaviors.
In experiments,
they are more likely
to cheat on a test
and to take more
than their fair share of money
from a common pot.
They become less likely
to help a stranger
in need
and more aggressive.
After being rebuffed
by someone,
the subject gets
to take revenge
by determining
how much hot sauce
the person will have
to consume.
Make someone
a free will skeptic
and they nearly double
the amount
of retributive hot sauce.
Less free will belief
and subjects feel
less grateful
to someone
who has done them
a favor.
Why feel gratitude
for an act
that was someone's
mere biological imperative?
And just in case
it seems like
these skeptics
are now having
too much nihilistic fun
by getting to take revenge
with a dish
served spicily,
the manipulation
also makes people
feel less meaning
in their lives
and less of a sense
of belonging
to other humans.
Moreover,
lessened free will belief
leads to people
feeling like
they have
less self-knowledge
and to feeling alienated
from their
true selves
when making
a moral decision.
This is hardly surprising
whether because
the main thing
that free will skepticism
does
is make you accept
that the vast majority
of your actions
arise from subterranean
biological forces
that you're completely
unaware of
or
because of the more
