namely the very foundation of the apartheid government.
Unlike with the Holocaust or the Armenian Genocide,
there could never be repulsive apartheid deniers,
insisting that the violence was exaggerated as propaganda
or the work of unsanctioned lone wolves.
While moving and surprisingly successful in preventing subsequent violence,
the relevance of such commissions to our concerns is limited.
Something similar might arise during the sentencing phase of a convicted crime,
where the perpetrator takes responsibility for his crime
and expresses remorse to his victims, often resulting in a lesser sentence.
But this whole approach is just reform,
where a criminal is simply punished less by a system that makes no sense.
Basically, someone claims that their criminal actions to have been freely willed
and that their current freely willed actions are those of a changed person.
Not what we're dealing with here.
Another model with some similarities, and the same ultimate irrelevance,
arises from the restorative justice movement,
which concerns the relationship between criminal and victim,
rather than between criminal and state.
As with truth and reconciliation commissions,
the criminal is expected to take responsibility for all the details of his actions.
The emphasis then is on mutual understanding.
For the perpetrator, it is to recognize the pain and suffering that he has caused,
to understand, to feel, to the point of remorse.
And for the victim, the goal is to understand the circumstances,
often awful and completely alien,
that made the offender the damaging person that he is.
And from that point, the aim becomes for both parties,
often with a mediator,
to figure out what they can do to eliminate some of each other's pain,
and to find ways to lessen the likelihood of this happening again.
Restorative justice seems to work,
decreasing recidivism rates.
That said,
there's the likelihood of self-selection bias.
A criminal who chooses to face their victim this way
is almost certainly not your average prisoner,
and is already heading in a good direction.
Restorative justice also seems to impact victims
in salutary ways.
Those who go through the process
report less fear and hatred of the perpetrator,
less anxiety about safety,
better functioning,
more enjoyment of everyday activities.
Nice, but, again,
there's the probability of self-selection bias.
But restorative justice has nothing to do with our focus.
This is because it accepts the need for retribution as a given,
with the prisoner,
now understanding the pain they inflicted,
more accepting of the legitimacy of being punished
by an irrational system.
The approach that actually makes sense to me the most
is the idea of quarantine.
It is intellectually clear as day
and completely compatible
with there being no free will.
It also immediately sticks in the craw
of lots of people.
As outlined by the hard incompatibilist philosopher
Dirk Peraboom of Cornell University,
it's straight out of the medical quarantine models
four tenets.
A. It is possible for someone
to have a medical malady
that makes them infectious,
contagious, dangerous,
or damaging to those around them.
B. It is not their fault.
C. To protect everyone else from them,
as something akin to an act of collective self-defense,
it is okay to harm them
by constraining their freedom.
D. We should constrain the person
the absolute minimal amount needed
to protect everyone,
and not an inch more.
It's leper colonies.
Involuntary hospitalization
in some cases of psychiatric illness.
The late 14th century European requirement
that ships sailing in from Asia
sit in the harbor for 40 days,
hence the quar in quarantine,
to avoid bringing another round
of bubonic plague.
This medical quarantine model
is a given in everyday life.
If your kindergartner has a cough or fever,
you're expected to keep them home
from school until they're better.
If you're a pilot,
you can't fly if you're taking a medication
that makes you drowsy.
If your elderly parent
is sliding into dementia,
they can't drive anymore.
Sometimes quarantine is imposed
out of ignorance.
It turns out that not all forms of leprosy
are particularly contagious,
obviating the need
for many of those quaint leper colonies.
Sometimes it is imposed
because of the profoundly unknowable.
When the Apollo 11 astronauts
returned from the first moon landing,
they spent 21 days in quarantine,
just in case of...
who knows what.
Sometimes it is laden with abuse
and bias.
The striking example concerns
Mary Mallon,
the typhoid Mary of history.
As the first identified case
of an asymptomatic spreader of typhoid,
responsible for sickening
more than a hundred people,
Mallon was arrested in 1907
and forcibly isolated
on a quarantine island
in the East River in New York.
From day one,
medical quarantine
has generated controversy,
a battle between
the rights of the individual
and the greater good.
We certainly saw
just how incendiary
this could be
during early COVID-19,
with those jackass,
don't-tell-me-what-to-do
coronavirus parties,
where super-spreaders
killed droves of people
by practicing
unsafe exhalation.
The extension of this
to criminology
in Periboum's thinking
is obvious.
A.
Some people are dangerous
because of problems
with the likes of
impulse control,
propensity for violence,
or incapacity for empathy.
B.
If you truly accept
that there is no free will,
it's not their fault.
It's the result of their genes,
fetal life,
hormone levels,
the usual.
C.
Nonetheless,
the public needs to be
protected from them
until they can be rehabilitated,
if possible,
justifying the constraint
of their freedom.
D.
But their quarantine
should be done in a way
that constrains the least.
Do what's needed
to make them safe,
and in all other ways,
they're free to be.
The retributive justice system
is built on
backward-looking proportionality,
where the more damage
is caused,
the more severe
the punishment.
A quarantine model
of criminality
shows forward-looking
proportionality,
where the more danger
is posed in the future,
the more constraints
are needed.
Peraboom's quarantine model
has been extended
by philosopher
Greg Caruso
of the State University
of New York,
another leading
incompatibilist.
Public health scientists
don't just figure out
that, say,
the brains of migrant
farm workers' kids
are damaged
by pesticide residues.
They also have
a moral imperative
to work to prevent
that from happening
in the first place,
say, by
testifying in lawsuits
against pesticide
manufacturers.
Caruso extends
this thinking
to criminology.
Yes,
the person is dangerous
because of causes
that they couldn't control,
and we don't know
how to rehabilitate them,
so let's minimally
constrain them
to keep everyone safe.
But let's also address
the root causes,
typically putting us
in the realm
of social justice.
Just as public health workers
think about
the social determinants
of health,
a public health-oriented
quarantine model
that replaces
the criminal justice system
requires attention
to the social determinants
of criminal behavior.
In effect,
it implies that
while a criminal
can be dangerous,
the poverty,
bias,
systemic disadvantaging,
and so on
that produce criminals
are more dangerous.
Naturally,
quarantine models
have been strongly criticized
in at least
three major ways.
The issue
of indefinite detention.
With prison,
there's an upper limit
to the length
of incarceration,
except in the case
of life without parole.
But a quarantine model
could keep you constrained
as long as was
Mary Mallon.
Thus,
it resembles its
disfigured troll cousin,
sending a criminal
who was not guilty
by reason of insanity
to a psychiatric hospital,
where the average stay
is often longer
than if they had been
jailed instead.
Unfortunately,
it makes sense
that if the person
continues to be dangerous,
constraints have to continue
for as long as necessary.
But in the context
of least infringement,
where constraint
might consist of having
to register with the police
whenever you move,
or wearing a tracking bracelet.
And notice that in this
cheery, perfect world
I'm imagining,
if things have gotten
to this point,
people wouldn't be
recoiling from this
constrained person
as a loathsome,
blameworthy criminal anymore,
but merely as someone
whose problems
in some domain
require that they
not be allowed
to do this or that.
Yeah, I know,
we have a long way to go.
The issue of
preemptive constraint.
If you can predict
whether a quarantined,
please,
we don't call them
criminals anymore,
criminal,
is likely to offend again,
you should have been
able to see it coming
even before they damaged
someone in the first place.
This raises the specter
of creepy
pre-crime apprehension,
as well as the need
to keep an eye
on the biases
of the folks
predicting the future
criminality.
Definitely something
we don't want to go near,
even if Tom Cruise
is willing to star
in the movie adaptation.
But yet,
we do pre-crime apprehension
all the time
in public health.
The rule for parents
of school children is,
if your child
isn't feeling well,
keep them home.
Not,
if your child
wasn't feeling well,
infected everyone else
in their class,
and still feels crummy,
then keep them home.
Pre-cough constraint.
Ideally,
you keep an individual
increasingly impaired
by dementia
from driving anymore
before they hit someone,
rather than after.
An equivalent
of pre-crime apprehension
is a standard
in public health.
What, then,
should the same look like
in our post-criminal
justice world?
Something decidedly
undystopian
once we recall
Caruso's emphasis
that least infringement
has to be coupled
with the paramount focus
on the social determinants
of criminality.
Another version of
and where did that intent
come from?
Identify the next
high school shooter
and, yes,
make it impossible
for him to buy
an automatic weapon
or a big sharp knife
or an unregistered
black market shillelagh.
But also do something
about how he's getting
bullied at school
and home
and is close to sinking
from unaddressed
psychological problems.
Sure,
spot the guy
who's costly
and growing addiction
to a street drug
is about to lead him
to mug people,
get him into rehab
to writhe and shiver
and puke
in a safe setting.
But also,
do something about
how he was taught
no skills
and has no job options.
I know,
after trying to be
a mixture of
Emma Goldman
in a bad mood
and John Lennon
singing Imagine,
I'm sounding like
a mildly progressive
candidate for the town council,
complete with an endorsement
from Mr. Rogers.
All I can say
is any version
of preemptive constraint
would have to be
in the context
of a world
in which people
truly accept
that terrible people
are produced
by terrible circumstances.
One minute before,
one hour before,
we have a really
long way to go.
The issue
of all that
potential fun.
A seemingly
strong objection
comes from
Israeli philosopher
Saul Smilansky,
who argues that
no matter how
minimally you constrain
someone's behavior
to make them safe,
they're still being
constrained for something
that is not their fault.
Given this,
the only morally
acceptable stance
must be to compensate
the constrained person
appropriately.
In this view,
if you're a convicted
pedophile,
and thus,
as is often the case,
are constrained
from coming
within a certain
distance of schools
or parks,
at least you should
get discounts
on drinks
at strip clubs.
If you're so violent
that you have to be
placed on a small island,
at least make it
a five-star resort
with private golf lessons.
If constraint,
no matter how minimal,
involves an adverse element
that is undeserved punishment,
quarantine advocates
must provide,
in Smilansky's words,
compensatory punishment.
And in Smilansky's view,
this will generate
more crime.
If you get away with it,
you benefit.
If you get caught,
you're compensated.
Win-win.
It would cause
what he calls a
motivational catastrophe.
Caruso's convincing response
is based on solid
empirical evidence
from those
fun-funishers,
the Scandinavians.
Compared with the U.S.,
Norway, for example,
has one-eighth
the murder rate,
one-eleventh
the rate of incarceration,
one-quarter
the rate of recidivism.
Well, that must be due
to a really draconian
prison system.
Quite the opposite.
It is of the type
that Smilansky anticipates
with dread.
In Norway's
open prison system,
criminals,
even those under
maximal security,
have rooms
rather than cells,
computers and TVs
in each,
freedom of movement,
kitchens to cook in
communally,
workshops for hobbies,
music studios
filled with instruments,
art on the walls,
trees on the campus-like grounds,
a chance to ski
in the winter,
and go to the beach
in the summer.
But what about the cost,
which must be ruinous?
It is true
that the annual cost
of housing a prisoner
in Norway
is about three times
that in the U.S.,
roughly $90,000
versus $30,000.
Nonetheless,
if you really analyze things,
the overall per capita cost
of containing crime
in Norway
is far less
than in the U.S.
Fewer prisoners,
who are educated enough
in prison
so that most eventually
return to the outside world
as wage earners,
rather than as likely recidivists.
Huge savings
from smaller police forces,
fewer families
disrupted and driven
into poverty
by the incarceration
of the primary source
of income.
Heck,
even the well-off
save money,
with less need
for expensive
home security systems
with CCTV
and panic buttons.
But what about
Smolanski's
motivational catastrophe,
with folks
lured into criminality
in order to head off
to a prison resort?
The much lower
recidivism rate
shows that
no amount of art
on the walls
and well-equipped kitchens
can outweigh
the incalculable value
of freedom.
Apparently,
we need not fear
turpitude and mayhem
caused by punishment.
I really like
quarantine models
for reconciling
there's no free will
with protecting society
from dangerous individuals.
It seems like
a logical
and morally acceptable
approach to take.
Nonetheless,
it is a doozy
of a problem,
one often framed
narrowly as the issue of
victims' rights.
This is actually
the tip of the iceberg
of a gigantic problem
that could sink
any approach
to subtracting free will
out of dealing
with dangerous individuals.
This is the intense,
complex,
and often rewarding
feelings we have
about getting
to punish someone.
Justice served
3.
Predictably,
southern states
lagged behind
northern ones
by a few decades,
but spurred
by growing condemnation
of the Yahoo Carnival
atmosphere
that typically ensued,
public hangings
were banned
throughout the United States
by the 1930s.
Everywhere,
that is,
except Kentucky,
where in the town
of Owensboro
in 1936,
there was what
proved to be
the final public
hanging in
American history.
The case was
some mutation
of perfect.
An elderly white woman,
Licia Edwards,
had been robbed,
raped,
and murdered
in her home.
Soon came the arrest
of Rainy Bethea,
a 20-something
African-American
with a record
of house break-ins.
The law had seemingly
gotten their man.
Bethea confessed,
which obviously
meant little
when a black man
was interrogated
by police
in the Jim Crow South.
But,
the perpetrator
had stolen
some of Edwards' jewelry,
and after confessing,
Bethea led police
to where the jewelry
was stashed.
The trial lasted
three hours.
Bethea's lawyer
neither cross-examined
prosecution witnesses
nor called
any witnesses.
The jury deliberated
for 4.5 minutes,
and Bethea
was condemned
to be executed
two months
after committing
the crime.
There's an extraordinary
detail.
Despite having both
raped and murdered
Edwards,
he was charged
only with rape.
Why?
Under state law,
murderers were executed
by the electric chair
within the prison.
In contrast,
a rapist
could still be
hanged publicly.
In other words,
the joy of getting
to publicly hang
a black man
for the rape
of a white woman
was irresistible.
The planned execution
had a juicy detail
that made
the national news.
Bethea would be
hanged by a woman.
In 1936,
the long-standing
sheriff of Owensboro,
Everett Thompson,
had died of pneumonia.
In an act of
widow's succession,
the county appointed
Thompson's widow,
Florence Shoemaker Thompson,
to fill in.
She had been sheriff
for only two months
when she presided
over the hunt
for Bethea,
and now she was
to preside
over his hanging.
The press and public
went wild.
There was a national
guessing game.
Would Thompson
actually pull the lever?
Or would a professional
executioner do it
with Thompson
officiating?
Rumors spread.
Clairvoyants
weighed in.
People placed bets.
The day before
the hanging,
Thompson announced
that there'd be
a professional
executioner,
something she had
actually decided
weeks earlier.
During this period
of frenzied speculation,
Thompson became
one of the most
polarizing figures
in the nation.
To some,
she was inspiring,
a member of the
delicate sex
suited for embroidery
and child care,
but nonetheless
willing to step
into the breach
as her civic duty.
To others,
she was an abomination,
taking a man's job
and neglecting
her children.
She received
death threats.
In an odd
paleo-feminist spirit,
it being merely
sixteen years
since women
had won the right
to vote,
she was praised
by some for showing
that women
were as capable
as men
in this occupational
niche.
Throughout,
there was the
powerful narrative
of Thompson
as some sort
of retributive
spirit animal
for the slain
Edwards,
a black man
who had
despoiled
white southern
womanhood
would be
hanged
by a white
southern woman.
Newspapers
fixated on her
being a mother.
Killer to be
hanged by
mother of four
ran the headline
in the Springfield,
Massachusetts,
Republican.
The Washington Post
called her
plump,
middle-aged.
The New York Times
referred to her
as the
fair sheriff.
She was
matronly
in another
newspaper account,
while another
noted that she
was a
good cook.
In addition
to the
mountains of
supportive letters
and hate mail,
Thompson received
several marriage
proposals.
When the day
arrived,
every hotel room
in Owensboro
was taken by
people from
across the country.
Bars stayed
open all night
in anticipation.
The hanging
venue had to be
moved from the
front of the town
courthouse to a
larger open
square, as it
was anticipated
that the huge
crowds would
trample the
recently planted
flowers at the
courthouse.
People camped
out the night
before in hopes
of a good view.
Fights broke
out among
attendees for
prime spots,
including between
women holding
babies.
Enterprising
young men sold
hot dogs and
lemonade to the
crowd.
An Owensboro
man who was a
fugitive from the
law was arrested
when he returned
to his hometown
to see the
hanging.
Twenty thousand
people jammed
the square.
Bethea was led
to the gallows.
He paused at the
bottom of the
steps with an
unlikely request.
In his pocket
was a new pair
of socks, which
he wanted to
wear.
After hurried
consultations, the
request was granted.
Shackled, he sat
on the first step
to make the
clothing switch,
and was then
led up the stairs
shoeless, in
new socks.
There were only
scattered shouts
from the crowd
to hang him.
Most craned
their necks in
silence.
Bethea's head
was hooded, and
after the trap
door failed to
open on the
first try, he
was properly
hanged.
Some members of
the crowd surged
forward while
Bethea was still
breathing, to
rip up the hood
for bits of
souvenir cloth.
Despite this
whiff of mob
violence, most
attendees peacefully
dispersed, justice
having been
done.
Punishing
cheaters
So now we've
got the plan to
abolish prisons and
the idea of
criminality and
switch to
quarantine
approaches.
All set, but
likely to be
unsuccessful because
of those intense,
complex, and
often rewarding
feelings we have
about getting to
punish someone,
which raises the
key issue of
how punishment
evolved.
It's easy to get
impressed with the
extent of our own
human sociality.
2.9 billion users
of Facebook,
Europe opening its
doors to Ukrainian
refugees,
Mbuti rainforest
hunter-gatherers in
Congo being up on
the Kardashians.
But we're not the
only ones.
Baboons live in
groups of 50 to 100,
a gazillion fish
school together,
a million wildebeest
migrate as a herd
in the Serengeti each
year, leaving
mountains of
new dung,
a mob of
meerkats,
pack of wolves,
clan of hyenas,
social insects,
slime molds,
single-cell bacteria
living in colonies.
A driving force on
the evolution of
sociality is the
fact that it
fosters cooperation,
many hands making
for light loads.
African cape-hunting
dogs pursue prey
cooperatively, where
some will cut a
corner, run
diagonally, to be
ready if the prey
changes direction.
Ditto for chimps,
where some drive
potential prey,
usually a monkey,
in the direction
where other chimps
are ready and
waiting.
Female bats feed
each other's babies.
Meerkats and
vervet monkeys
endanger themselves
by revealing their
location when they
give predator alarm
calls that benefit
everyone.
There are those
social insects
foregoing reproduction
in obeisant loyalty
to queen and
colony.
Single-cell bacteria
cooperatively form
multicellular structures
that are needed for
reproduction.
Then there are the
slime mold's
constituent members,
studying together for
the maze-solving
final.
There's even the
nascent field of
socio-virology,
concerning cooperation
between viruses in
better penetrating and
replicating in a
target cell.
At the turn of the
last century,
scientists in the
West were busy
misinterpreting Darwin
as showing that
evolutionary success
is built solely on
competition,
aggression,
and domination.
Meanwhile,
Russian scientist
and historian,
philosopher,
exorist,
prince,
revolutionary,
and gently
fire-breathing
anarchist,
Peter Propotkin
published a book
60 years ahead of
its time,
Mutual Aid,
A Factor of
Evolution.
The ubiquity of
cooperation among
social species
raises a ubiquitous
problem.
Sure,
it's great when
everyone cooperates
for the greater
good,
but it's even
better when everyone
else does that
while you mooch
off them.
This is the
problem of
cheating.
A lioness
conveniently
lags behind
the others
in a dangerous
hunt.
A bat
doesn't feed
the other's
kids,
but freeloads
on their
cooperation.
A baboon
stabs his
coalitional
partner in
the back.
Two separate
colonies of
genetically
identical social
amoebas merge
to form a
multicellular
structure called
a fruiting
body,
which consists
of a stalk,
which gives
stability,
and a cap.
Only the
amoebas in
the cap
reproduce,
and cooperation
consists of
each colony
equally sharing
the bummer of
being non-reproducing
stalk cells.
Instead,
different strains
will try to
cheat,
exploiting the
other colony
by preferentially
hogging seats
on the cap.
Even
mitochondria
and stretches
of DNA
cheat in
cooperative
ventures.
And sure
as the
day is
long,
the ubiquity
of cheating
drove the
evolution of
countermeasures
to detect
and punish
it.
Chimps that
fail to
support an
ally in
a fight
are pummeled
afterward.
Wrens that
don't feed the
nestlings of
the dominant
breeding pair
are attacked.
Naked
mole rat
queens are
aggressive toward
workers that
are slacking.
In the
mutualism where
reefer fish are
cleaned by
wrasse fish that
get to eat the
parasites they
harvest, some
wrasses cheat to
get an even
better meal by
taking a bite out
of the reefer
fish.
They are then
driven away and
chastened, less
likely to renege on
their mutualistic
contract afterward.
Social bacteria
won't form
fruiting bodies
with bacterial
clonal lines that
cheat.
Green algae have
developed means of
not passing on
egregiously selfish
mitochondria when
the cell divides.
Cells evolve the
means to silence
all of the copies
of a transposon
whose self-serving
replication has
gotten out of
hand.
For example, a
particular
exploitative type
of transposon
invaded fruit flies
in the 1970s, and
it took 40 years
for the flies to
evolve the means of
punitively silencing
it.
Crucially, punishment
works to maintain
cooperation.
In economic games
involving a pair of
players, for
example, the
ultimatum game, one
of the two is given
the power to exploit
the other.
And putting the
lie to the myth
that we are nothing
but homo
economicus, rational
optimizers of
self-interest, players
in the driver's seat
typically don't start
off exploiting as
much as they could.
If the other player
has the opportunity
to punish the
first player for
being unduly
exploitative,
exploitation
subsequently decreases
further.
In the absence of a
mechanism for
punishment, exploitation
festers.
The right kind of
punishment at the
right time matters
for enhancing
cooperation.
A monumentally
influential example
of this came from
a game theory study
in 1981 by
political scientist
Robert Axelrod
and evolutionary
biologist W.D.
Hamilton, two
titans in their
fields.
The experiment
involved the
prisoner's dilemma,
P.D., a game
in which two
players, unable
to communicate,
must each decide
whether to
cooperate with
or cheat against
the other player.
If they both
cooperate, each
gains some
brownie points.
If they both
cheat, they both
lose.
So, obviously,
one should always
cooperate, right?
But not so fast.
If the other
player cooperates
while you stab
them in the
back by not
reciprocating,
they lose a
bundle of
points and
you get the
biggest reward
of all.
If it's you
who is the
overly trusting
goat, the
opposite ensues.
Axelrod and
Hamilton asked
an array of
game theorists
to tell them
what their
P.D.
strategy would
be and ran
a computerized
round-robin
tournament where
each strategy
was pitted
against each
of the other
ones 200
times.
And omit
some complex
algorithms for
contingent
punishment.
The strategy
that won was
the simplest.
Tit for tat.
Start off by
cooperating and
continue to do
so unless the
other player
double-crosses
you.
At that point,
do it back in
the next round.
If they continue
cheating, continue
punishing them
back.
But if they go
back to
cooperating, you
resume the same
in the next
round.
A strategy that
has clear rules
that starts with
cooperation, that
is proportionately
punitive against
cheaters, and
that can forgive.
This study launched
an industry of
follow-ups exploring
variants on
tit for tat, their
evolution, and
real-world examples
in various social
species.
The punishment
scenarios in the
ultimatum game, or
the P.D., are
termed second-party
punishment, where a
victim revenges
themselves on a
bully.
An even more
effective mechanism
for suppressing
cheating and
fostering cooperation
is third-party
punishment, when an
outsider steps in
and punishes the
jerk.
Think police.
This is a much
more sophisticated
domain of
punishment.
While infants
show the rudiments
of it, they take
years to do so
consistently, and it
is unique to
humans.
This is an
altruistic act,
where you pay a
cost, that is, for
example, your
effort, to punish
someone for
everyone's good.
Reflecting that
altruism, people
who are prone to
do this tend to be
prosocial in other
realms, and show
disproportionate
activation of a
brain region involved
in perspective-taking.
They excel at
viewing the world
from the standpoint
of the victim.
Moreover, treating
subjects with
oxytocin, a
hormone that
stimulates in-group
prosociality, increases
people's willingness to
take on the burden of
third-party punishment.
Then there's fourth-party
punishment, where a
third-order witness is
punished for not doing
their job.
Think of honor codes,
where you get in
trouble if you don't
rat out the person you
saw cheating, or a
police arrested for
taking bribes.
And fifth-party
punishment, punish the
police review board for
not punishing corrupt
cops.
Then, sixth, seventh, at
which point you're
describing a network of
people willing to
punish to maintain
cooperation.
Cool cross-cultural
research shows that
small traditional
cultures, say,
hunter-gatherers or
subsistence farmers,
don't carry out
third-party punishment,
either in real life or
when playing economic
games.
They fully understand
when cheating occurs,
but just don't bother.
Explanation.
Everyone knows each
other and what they're
up to, so you don't
need fancy third-party
enforcement to rein in
antisocial behavior.
Supporting this, the
larger the society, the
more formalize the
third-party policing.
In addition, fourth-party
punishing of third-party
cheating works best when
there are only a small
number of third-party
enforcers.
Think of the chaos if,
instead of police, things
ran solely on citizens'
arrests.
Cross-cultural research
casts light on the
emergence of the
ultimate form of
third-party punishment,
namely, deities who
monitor and judge
humans.
As studied by
psychologist Ara
Norenzayan of the
University of British
Columbia, gods
invented by cultures
built on small social
groups have no
interest in human
affairs.
It's only when
communities get large
enough that there's
the possibility for
anonymous actions, or
interactions between
strangers, that we see
invention of moralizing
gods who know if you've
been bad or good.
Consonant with this,
across an array of
religions, the more that
deities are viewed as
punitive, the more people
are pro-social to
anonymous, distant
co-religionists.
Thus, punishment in its
game-theory versions
discourages cheating and
facilitates cooperation.
But there's a big
problem.
Punishment is costly.
Suppose you're playing
the ultimatum game, and
the other player makes you
an offer of 99 to 1.
If you reject their
offer, you're giving up
the opportunity to get
one dollar, which, while
not great, is better than
nothing.
Rejecting is irrational
and costly, unless you're
playing a second round
with the person, where
you're rejecting a low
ball offer will prompt
the other player to come
back with a better offer
that produces a net gain
for you.
In a case like this,
punishment isn't costly.
Instead, such self-serving
punishment pays off in the
future, assuming you have
the privilege of being
able to hold out for the
future, instead of
accepting whatever crumbs
are being offered.
Where gameplay is purely
altruistic is if you give
up one dollar, rejecting a
99 to 1 offer, in a single
round game, with the
chastened other guy thus
making a better offer to the
next person.
Third-party punishment is
even more costly.
It's the ultimatum game, and
you observe player A totally
exploiting powerless player B.
Outraged, you step in and
spend, say, ten dollars of
your own money to cost player
A twenty dollars as
punishment.
Humbled, they're nicer to
whomever they play against
they're after.
And if this doesn't include
you down the line, your
costly act is purely
altruistic punishment.
A way to lower the cost of
punishing involves reputation,
an incredibly reliable means
of influencing behavior.
In tests of game theory,
cooperation is boosted if
people know your history of
play.
That is, open-book play that
produces a shadow of the
future.
Be known as a free rider, and
others will start off not
trusting you or refusing to
play with you.
This occurs among hunter-gatherers
who spend a huge amount of
time gossiping about, among
other things, who has cheated
by, say, not sharing meat.
Get a reputation for that and
you're ostracized, which can be
life-threatening.
In contrast, the cost of
third-party punishment are
reduced because your reputation
is enhanced and people trust you
more.
If you're already viewed as
socially dominant, being a
third-party punisher makes you
seem more formidable and
likable.
These are all distal solutions to
the problem of the cost of
punishment.
As first introduced in
chapter 2, there's distal, big
picture, long perspective levels
of explanation, in contrast to
proximal, focusing on
motivations and explanations in
the moment.
Why do animals mate, expending
efforts and calories, often
risking their lives?
Distal explanation, because it
allows you to leave copies of
your genes in the next
generation.
Proximal explanation, it feels
good.
Why punish cheaters when it's
costly?
The distal explanation is what
we've been discussing, because
reliably and collectively
sharing the costs benefits
everyone.
But it is when we look for a
proximal explanation that we
see how it's going to be so
damn hard to get people to
proclaim the lack of free will
and just quarantine the
dangerous.
Why punish cheaters when it's
costly?
Proximally, because we like to
punish wrongdoers.
It feels great.
Justice served.
Four.
It's a magnetic draw of our
attention.
We want to identify a
perimeter.
It's the concentration camp
porn of sensing the outer
limits of human depravity.
It facilitates a feel-good
experiment.
What if it were a loved one of
mine, followed by the relief of
choosing to step back from the
edge of the bottomless pit with
the knowledge that it doesn't
apply to us?
Sometimes it's just primate
voyeurism.
It is our fascination with
serial murderers, the filing
away of numbers of victims and
the grotesqueries of the
killings.
Jeffrey Dahmer having sex with
the corpses of his victims,
cannibalizing them, proclaiming
his love for them.
John Wayne Gacy entertaining
hospitalized kids, dressed as a
clown, Charles Manson, the 60s
cultural incarnation of Satan's
son, the ones with the
nicknames, Son of Sam, the
Boston Strangler, the Zodiac
Killer, the Night Stalker, the
DC Sniper, the steampunk
kitsch of Jack the Ripper.
Another serial murderer whose
notoriety has persisted is Ted
Bundy.
To use a ghastly term, he was a
run-of-the-mill serial murderer,
killing roughly 30 women in the
mid-1970s, far from a record
holder.
There was the usual sickening
litany, rape, murder,
necrophilia, cannibalism.
He kept decapitated heads of
victims in his apartment as
mementos, shampooing their hair
and putting makeup on them.
We're particularly fascinated with
unlikely serial killers.
Responsible husband and father,
Boy Scout leader, church elder,
and Bundy is way up on that list.
It's virtually required to describe
him as handsome and charismatic,
which is exactly what he was in
interviews.
An honor student at the University of
Washington, then a law student,
active in politics, a delegate for
Nelson Rockefeller at the 1968
Republican National Convention, a
kind, empathic volunteer at a
suicide hotline.
He worked on someone's successful
campaign to be governor of
Washington state.
The candidate expressed his
gratitude with the breathtaking
irony of appointing Bundy to the
Seattle Crime Prevention Advisory
Committee.
Somewhere around then, he began
killing.
He targeted young women.
Early on, Bundy simply broke into
apartments and attacked people in
their sleep.
His approach evolved to luring
someone to his car by requesting
help carrying something, pulling
this off with charm and a seemingly
broken limb in a cast.
Sometimes he buffed up the
verisimilitude with crutches.
He would then bludgeon the victim.
Eventually caught, Bundy was
convicted for a number of
murders, in one much-publicized
instance, incriminated in part by
the match between his teeth and the
bite marks on the buttock of his
victim, and given the death penalty.
He escaped from prison twice, but was
eventually put to death in 1989.
Bundy fascinated criminologists and
mental health professionals, who
handed out a variety of diagnoses of
psychopathy, reflecting his
manipulativeness, narcissism, and
remorselessness.
He fascinated the public as well.
Books were written and movies made
about him, two and one, respectively,
while he was still alive.
Numerous women wrote to him in prison,
some devastated by both his death and
the subsequent discovery that they were
not actually his beloved one and only.
Few remember the names of his victims.
Bundy was executed by electric chair.
In 1881, a drunk worker had grabbed the
wires of an electric dynamo in a power
plant and been instantly killed.
Hearing about this, a dentist named
Alfred Southwick conceived of a machine
for electrocuting people as a humane
alternative to hanging.
After practicing on stray dogs, he had
perfected his invention.
The chair part of the original electric
chair, bound for iconic status, was a
dental chair modified by Southwick.
It was the execution method of choice for
most of the 20th century.
When things went right, the wave of
electricity caused unconsciousness within
seconds and fatal cardiac arrest within a
minute or two.
When things didn't go right, multiple
rounds of electrocution might be required,
or the prisoner would remain conscious and
in extreme pain.
In one case, the prisoner's face mask caught
on fire.
Bundy's execution, however, was routine.
The execution was much anticipated throughout
the country, with celebratory barbecues held
the evening before, many called Bundy Cues,
featuring Bundy burgers and electric hot dogs.
Particularly raucous partying occurred at a
fraternity at Florida State University, a
school attended by two of Bundy's victims.
On the day of the execution, hundreds gathered
across the street from the prison in Rayford,
Florida, where he would be killed.
The crowd, which included families with children,
sang, chanted,
burn, Bundy, burn, and set off fireworks.
News of his death was greeted with cheers.
The somber witnesses to the execution, as they
exited the prison, were reportedly shocked by the
revelry.
Celebrations over, the crowd dispersed,
justice served.
Delicious, whether served hot or cold.
Here's a thoroughly elegant study, carried out by German
psychologist Tanya Singer.
Subjects were either six-year-old kids or chimps.
One of the researchers comes into the room and either does
something nice to the kid or chimp, offering some desirable
food, or does something mean, teasing them by starting to give the
food and then snatching it away.
The researcher leaves and then enters an adjacent room, visible to the
subject through an observation window.
Someone sneaks up behind the researcher and, whoa, seemingly starts
hitting them over the head with a stick, with the researcher crying out in
pain.
After ten seconds, the assailant drags the researcher to an adjacent room
and then resumes the hitting.
The kid or chimp can go into their own adjacent room with another window, giving
them the opportunity to watch.
Do they move to do this?
If the researcher being pummeled had been nice to them, only 18% moved to see
the rest.
If the researcher had been mean, 50% leaped at the opportunity.
Both kids and chimps were particularly interested in seeing someone who was mean
to them get punished.
Importantly, getting into the adjacent viewing room was costly.
Kids had been receiving tokens for some irrelevant task, which they could trade in
for desirable stickers.
They had to relinquish tokens to watch the continued punishment.
For the chimps, the door to the next room was extremely heavy, requiring considerable work
to watch the continued punishment.
And when it was the mean person being punished, kids forked out the tokens and chimps moved
mountains and heavy doors to see.
In other words, the kids and the chimps were willing to incur costs to pay in currency or
effort to continue basking in the pleasure of watching the antisocial person getting what
they deserved.
While watching the continued punishment, kids typically had a facial expression long associated
with schadenfreude, the emotion of gloating over another's misfortune, an involuntary frown
coinciding with the blows, coupled with a smile.
If it was the antisocial teaser getting punished, that expression occurred about four times as
often as it was the kind, pro-social person being punished.
And for the chimps, if it was the good Samaritan getting punished, the chimps gave agitated
vocalizations.
If it was the mean human, not a peep from the chimps.
We pay for stuff that gives us pleasure.
A terrifying slasher movie, if you're that kind of paradoxical individual.
Cocaine.
Bananas.
A chance to read sexually arousing writing or look at sexually arousing pictures.
And here are both kids and chimps paying for the pleasure of watching the wicked get their
just rewards.
The study had another fascinating wrinkle, showing the sophistication of humans, even
kids, relative to chimps.
In this version of the experimental design, the kid or chimp watched the researcher being
nice or mean to another human or chimp.
That second chimp, termed the stooge chimp, was trained for the role, and presumably received
co-authorship on the paper.
Then, as before, the researcher got attacked and dragged to the other room.
Kids would also pay to watch third-party punishment.
Chimps, who showed no third-party punishment experimentally, had no interest in watching it
occur.
A great study, showing how deeply seated, both developmentally and taxonomically, is
our enjoyment of seeing righteous punishment served.
Good luck convincing people that blame and punishment are scientifically and morally bankrupt.
The same unsettling conclusion comes from neuroimaging studies.
If someone makes you an unfair offer in the ultimatum game, your insula, anterior cingulate
cortex, and amygdala activate, a picture of disgust, pain, and anger.
The lowball offer puts you at a split in the road.
If it's a single-round game, punish retributively, or be purely logical and accept the offer that
is better than nothing.
The more activation of your insula and amygdala, and the more pissed off you report being by
inequity in general, the more likely you are to reject the offer.
This retributive irrationality is all about emotion.
If people believe they are rejecting an unfair offer from a human rather than a computer,
there is also activation of that emotional VMPFC.
Making a similar point, men with higher testosterone levels are
more likely to reject such offers.
The picture of altruistic third-party punishment is much the same, with the neuroimaging indices
of anger and disgust activated.
Along with that is what you'd also expect, namely, activation of a brain region called
the temporal parietal junction, TPJ.
That region involved in perspective taking.
And the perspective taking isn't just about the victims.
The more TPJ activation, the more likely you are to forgive transgressors or accept the role of mitigating factors.
For example, poverty and explaining their behavior.
So, on a neurobiological level, second-party punishers are about disgust, anger, and pain,
whereas third-party punishers have the same, plus the perspective taking needed to view someone else's misfortune as akin to your own.
But then there is the crucial additional finding in all these cases.
Retributive punishing in any of these guises
also activates the dopamine circuitry involved in reward, the ventral tegmentum and nucleus accumbens.
Activation by punishment of the brain region,
goosed by the likes of orgasm or cocaine.
It feels good.
Additional studies make the point even further.
Symbolic punishment doesn't activate reward circuits as much as does the real thing.
For example, blasting someone with a loud noise.
More punishment correlates with more activation of the nucleus accumbens.
And lots of accumbens activations, when you get to punish a cheater for free,
predicts a greater likelihood of paying to punish a cheater.
The circuitry activates whether you are someone who is independently meeting out punishment
or a conformer joining the vengeful crowd.
Being altruistic can feel good.
It decreases pain in cancer patients,
blunts the activation of neural pain pathways in response to shock.
It even literally gives you a warm glow,
such that people estimate ambient temperatures as being higher after an altruistic act.
Nice.
But being able to righteously punish evildoers feels really good.
But as will be seen in a bit,
even that can be tamed.
Justice served.
Five.
The United States began as an experiment in convincing a bunch of unlike-minded states
to form, if not a perfect union, at least a functional one.
This was an iffy proposition from the start.
It took nearly a century for Americans to transition from statements like,
the United States are doing X to the United States is doing X.
And from the start, there has always been an opposition that views the very notion of a federated government as tyranny.
That certainly describes the Confederacy.
Likewise for those resisting federal mask mandates during the pandemic.
Likewise on January 6, 2020.
For those who believed that it was despotic for those D.C. pedophiles to insist
that the person who loses an election doesn't get to be president.
The Patriot Anti-Government Militia Movement continues to grow
and provided the toxic ideology that motivated an American to declare war against the United States in 1995.
Most proximally, he was outraged by the siege of white supremacist Randy Weaver and family
in Ruby Ridge, Idaho in 1992
and the siege of David Koresh's Branch Davidian cult in Waco, Texas in 1993.
On the second anniversary of the Waco siege,
he used a bomb made of 5,000 pounds of ammonium nitrate
to blow up the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City.
Timothy McVeigh's act of terrorism was the most destructive in American history.
Until 9-11.
He killed 168 people, injured 853.
More than 300 surrounding buildings were damaged and 400 people left homeless.
The blast registered 6.0 on the Richter scale, 55 miles away.
And as the details seared into everyone's memory,
McVeigh's victims included nine children in a daycare center in the building.
Thanks to eyewitness descriptions, McVeigh was soon apprehended.
His statements in the years after were conflicting.
He claimed he didn't know there was a daycare center in the building
and that if he had, he would have shifted targets.
He dismissed the dead children as collateral damage.
He described understanding the pain of victims' families.
He said that he had no sympathy for them.
He wondered if maybe he should have bypassed a bombing
and instead used his army-acquired skill as a sniper to take out selected targets.
He expressed regret at not killing more people.
His 1997 trial was moved to Denver
because of the impossibility of a fair trial in Oklahoma.
It was estimated that 360,000 Oklahomans
knew someone who worked in the Murrah building.
He was found guilty of all charges and given the death penalty.
He asserted his supposed dominance
by describing his eventual execution as
state-assisted suicide.
He would be executed by lethal injection,
which by then had become the technique of choice,
viewed as more humane than the electric chair or gas chamber.
The prisoner is strapped down,
an IV line is put into the arm,
with a backup line into the other,
and a trio of drugs is infused.
That sequentially renders the person unconscious within seconds,
paralyzes the person,
and thus stops their breathing,
and stops their heart.
The painless process kills the prisoner within minutes.
Naturally, it's not so simple.
Trained medical professionals usually refuse to participate
or are banned from doing so
by their state professional board.
As a result,
the IV line is put in by a correctional officer
who often botches things
with multiple sticks required
or the vein missed entirely
so that drug is injected into muscle
and then absorbed slowly.
The initial anesthetic,
which rapidly induces unconsciousness,
also wears off quickly,
so the subsequent steps might be done
to someone who is conscious
and feeling pain
but can't express that
because they are paralyzed.
Sometimes the second drug
does not adequately stop breathing,
minutes passing
with the prisoner gasping for air.
Moreover,
many drug manufacturers,
particularly in the European Union,
refuse to sell
or are banned from selling
a medical drug
that will be used for killing.
And various states
have had to improvise
alternative drug cocktails
with varying degrees of success
at inducing a painless death.
Despite those potential snafus,
McVeigh's 2001 execution
went off without a hitch.
The night before,
he met with the priest,
watched some TV,
and had his last meal.
Incongruously,
PETA,
People for the Ethical Treatment
of Animals,
had written to the warden,
stating that
after the lives McVeigh had taken,
animals should at least be spared
and he be served
a vegetarian meal.
The warden,
defending McVeigh's rights,
told PETA to get lost
and that he could eat
whatever he wanted,
so long as it didn't involve alcohol
or cost more than $20.
Whether McVeigh heeded PETA's call
is unknown,
but his last meal
consisted of mint chocolate chip
ice cream.
Normally,
the witness room
has seats for relatives
of the victim.
More than 300 applied
to be there,
along with survivors
of the bombing.
Room was made for 10,
with the rest
allowed to watch
the execution
by a video link
from the Terre Haute,
Indiana prison
to Oklahoma City.
A bug in the video system
delayed the execution
for 10 minutes.
The remaining witnesses
were mostly reporters
and all gave the same account.
McVeigh,
from the gurney,
made eye contact
and nodded slightly
to each witness.
He lay on his back,
stared at the ceiling,
and died with his eyes open.
While silent throughout,
McVeigh had requested
that copies be handed
to witnesses
of the 1875 poem
Invictus
by William Ernest Henley,
a tracly,
self-congratulatory
paean to stoicism
in which the author
acclaims himself
as unconquerable,
unbowed,
and with a fearless visage,
ending with flourishing
he bragging about
mastering his fate
and captaining his soul.
Screw you all,
the mass murderer
had said one last time.
In the press conference
afterward,
media witnesses
varied in describing him
as seeming arrogant,
defeated,
aged,
or commanding the scene.
One reporter appeared
to believe that McVeigh
had written the poem.
They all struggled
to flesh out the story,
noting the number of times
he took a breath
at some juncture,
the color of his shirt,
the length of his hair.
Differing opinions
were offered
as to whether the curtain
was green
or bluish green.
Outside the prison,
1,400 reporters
had been on site
for three days.
The event was catered
by a local meeting
and event firm,
their first execution.
For $1,146.50,
reporters were given
a padded chair,
a writing table
with a cloth skirt
guaranteed to be changed daily,
chilled bottled water,
phone service,
and transportation
around the prison grounds
by golf cart.
The hoi polloi reporters
unwilling to pony up
the money
may do in tents
without chairs,
electricity,
or phone lines.
A Washington Post reporter,
either sheepish
or gloating,
admitted in his coverage
that his paper
had sprung
for three deluxe packages.
4,000 feet away
from the reporters
were the prison grounds
reserved for protesters,
two separate areas
for the anti-death penalty
attendees,
numbering approximately
a hundred,
and the handful
of pro-death celebrants
driven to the spot
on two different buses.
No transportation here
for ambivalent protesters.
Prison authorities
wanted to avoid
the circus of Bulgarians
that had accompanied
Bundy's death.
Protesters were allowed
a protest sign,
a candle with a windscreen,
and a Bible.
Other than some jeers
from the pro-death penalty protesters,
the crowd was quiet
and dispersed peacefully.
Justice had been served.
We're at loggerheads.
There's no such thing
as free will,
and blame and punishment
are without any
ethical justification.
But we've evolved
to find the right kind
of punishment
viscerally rewarding.
This is hopeless.
Maybe not, though,
as this chapter
has shown an additional
type of evolution.
Frenzied mobs,
intoxicated with
conspiracy theories,
slashing,
stabbing,
burning hundreds
to right a supposed wrong.
A huge mob
spending four hours
watching a man
be slowly torn to pieces
by horses
in order to right a wrong.
Twenty thousand people
watching someone
be dropped through
a trap door
with a rope
snapping his neck.
Another act
of righting a wrong.
Hundreds gathering
to celebrate news
that a wrong
has been righted
with an electric chair.
A handful of people,
outnumbered ten to one
by death penalty opponents,
gathering for news
that a wrong
has been righted
by someone
being quietly overdosed.
What accounts
for these transitions?
The replacement
of violent mobs,
with mobs
watching officials
being violent,
is obvious.
Part of the centralization
to power
and legitimizing
of the state,
the first steps
toward a criminal trial,
reified with a
the state of
whichever
versus Jones.
The transition
from drawing
and quartering
to a quick
public hanging?
A standard explanation
is that this
reflected
reformist pressure.
The shift
from public execution
to electrocution
behind prison walls?
This revolved
around whom
the killing
was being performed
for.
Sociologist
Anulla Linders
of the University
of Cincinnati
has argued
that this was
another step
in the state's
quest for legitimacy.
Instead of taking
its approval
from a mob
of observers,
often threatening
to lynch the person
if the state
didn't do it for them,
legitimacy was now
coming from
the approving presence
of a handful
of distinguished
gentlemen
quietly observing
the event.
In other words,
acquiring this
new source
of legitimacy
outweighed
the moral
rejuvenation
of the mob,
obtained by
reminding it viscerally
about who was
the man.
Electrocution
to lethal injection?
With the U.S.
in the ever-dwindling
club of death-penalty
countries,
with the likes
of Saudi Arabia,
Ethiopia,
and Iran,
it seemed prudent
to switch
from a method
that could cause
the person's
face mask
to explode
in flames
to something
ideally
resembling
euthanizing
an elderly dog.
From our perspective,
the transition
can be framed
much more
informatively.
At some point,
authorities
showed up
and said,
Look,
we know
it's great fun
for all of you
to get to
slaughter
lepers and
Jews,
but the times
they are a-changing,
and from now on,
we're the ones
doing the killing,
and you're just
going to have
to get your pleasure
from watching
the person
be tortured
for hours.
And then
the transition
to,
And you're just
going to have
to get your pleasure
from watching
us take a minute
or two
to kill someone
by hanging.
And then to,
You can wait
outside,
and we'll tell
you when it's done.
We'll even let
journalist witnesses
tell you about
the gory parts
of electrocuting
someone.
And that has
to be sufficiently
pleasurable.
And then go on
to,
Get your pleasure
from knowing
that we've killed
the person,
albeit,
relatively peacefully.
And with each
transition,
people got used
to things.
Not always,
not quickly,
sometimes not ever,
of course.
Every crowd
celebrating the news
of some criminal's
execution
inevitably produces
a quote
to the effect
of how the
condemned
is getting
an easier
death
than he deserves
after what
he put his
victims through.
And that must
feel just searing
in its injustice.
There were
probably people
in the crowd
who felt
that Damien
was getting
off easy
for sticking
a penknife
into the king.
So there are
always people
who feel like
there was
too little
retribution.
Importantly,
retribution built
on perceptions
of free will
does help
some victims
reach the
unreachable
state of
closure.
One sticky
way to respond
to that
is to question
whether acts
of retribution,
reframed as
compassion for
the bereaved,
should be a
right of
victims or
their families.
An easier
response is to
point out the
well-documented
but not widely
known fact
that closure
for victims
or their families
is mostly a
myth.
Law professor
Susan Bandes
of DePaul
University
finds that
for many,
the execution
and the
accompanying
media coverage
are retraumatizing,
impeding their
recovery.
A surprising
number reached
the point of
actively opposing
the execution.
Social workers
Marilyn Armour
of the University
of Texas
and Mark
Umbright
of the University
of Minnesota
studied family
members of
homicide victims
in their two
states.
the former
leading the
way in
executing
prisoners,
the latter
having banned
it more
than a
century ago.
They found
that from
the perspectives
of health,
psychological
well-being,
and daily
function,
the Minnesotans
fared significantly
better than
the Texans.
Moreover,
a recent
first-of-its-kind
national survey
of victims
of violent
crime reported
by a wide
margin a
preference that
criminal justice
focus on
rehabilitation
rather than
retribution,
and that
expenditures be
increased for
crime prevention
rather than
incarceration.
Those victims
and families
who do favor
retribution and
beefing up of
prisons may
actually be looking
for something
very different
and rarely
stated.
In justifying
the death
penalty,
William Barr,
attorney general
for both
George W. Bush
and Donald Trump,
wrote,
We owe it
to the victims
and their
families to
carry forward
the sentence
imposed by
our justice
system.
What he is
really saying
is that the
government is
morally obligated
to enact
the strongest
possible
manifestation
of its
culture's
values in
that realm,
whether drawing
and quartering
or quarantining.
We can get a
sense of this
by taking the
evolutionary arc
from burning
lepers
to overdosing
McVeigh
one step
further.
In July
2011,
Norwegian
Anders Breivik
carried out
the largest
terrorist attack
in Norwegian
history.
Breivik,
a lump of
narcissism
and mediocrity,
had tried
and failed
at a string
of personas,
with his
ideology
completely
malleable
and his
failures
always someone
else's fault.
He had
finally found
his people
among white
supremacist
troglodytes.
Following
the standard
playbook,
Breivik
proclaimed
that white
Christian
European
culture
was being
destroyed
in his
country
by
immigrants,
multiculturalism
and the
political
progressives
who supported
it.
He first
set off
a bomb
near the
office
of the
socialist
democratic
prime
minister,
killing
eight.
He then
drove 25
miles to
a lake
containing
the small
island
of Utoya.
On it
was a
summer camp
for a
youth
organization
associated
with the
Labour Party,
an organization
that over
the decades
had produced
a string
of left-leaning
prime ministers
and won
Nobel Peace
Prize winner.
Breivik,
dressed as a
police officer,
was ferried
to the
island and
spent the
next hour
calmly gunning
down 69
teenagers.
At his
trial,
he gave
long
meandering
rants
about how
his
Christian
European
vogue
were being
destroyed,
claimed to
be a
knight in
a confabulated
modern
knight's
Templar,
and gave
pseudo-Nazi
salutes.
He was
found guilty
of the
mass murder
and given
the longest
sentence
possible in
Norway.
21 years.
Breivik was
then deposited
in one of
Norway's
dens of
funishment.
He has a
three-room
living space,
computer,
TV,
PlayStation,
treadmill,
and kitchen.
He was
able to
submit an
entry to
a prison
gingerbread
house
competition.
Amid
some heated
public debate,
he was
accepted by
the University
of Oslo
to matriculate
remotely as,
unironically,
a political
science student.
Norway's
response to
the slaughter?
Exactly what
Barr unintentionally
implied.
One survivor
appraised the
trial,
saying,
The ruling
in the
Breivik case
shows that
we acknowledge
the humanity
of extremists
too.
They continued,
If he,
Breivik,
is deemed
not to be
dangerous anymore
after 21
years,
then he
should be
released.
That's how
it should
work.
That's staying
true to our
principles,
and the best
evidence that
he hasn't
changed our
society.
Prime Minister
Jens Stoltenberg,
who knew a
number of the
victims and
their families,
stated,
Our answer
is more
democracy,
more openness,
and more
humanity,
but never
naivety.
Norway's
universities
accept prisoners
as remote
students,
and in
explaining his
decision to
offer the
same to
Breivik,
the rector of
the university
said that they
were doing so
for our
own sake,
not for
his.
In the
Norwegian
version of
Barr,
survivors and
families of
the slaughtered
were owed
the knowledge
that their
nation had
responded to
their nightmare
with the
strongest possible
expression of
their values.
And what
were the
responses of
the average
Norwegian to
the trial?
The majority
were satisfied
with the
outcome,
felt it had
preventative
value,
and reaffirmed
democratic
values.
Perhaps as a
measure of
its efficacy,
before the
trial,
8% wanted
revenge,
while after,
only 4%
did.
And the
response of
Norwegians to
Breivik himself?
In his
arraignment
hearing,
Breivik's
claim to be
a literal
knight of
the indigenous
Norwegian
people was
met with
the wave
of derisive
laughter from
the gallery.
Breivik had
posted a
photo of
himself in
his knight's
Templar
outfit.
And one
newspaper
reproduced it
under the
sardonic
contemptuous
heading,
That's how
he got his
one-man army.
What he wore
was described
as a costume
rather than
a uniform,
a pathetic
nobody playing
dress-up who
could now be
forgotten.
With Breivik,
Norway joined
the ranks of
peoples who
have had to
figure out how
not to hate
those who
have damaged
them terribly.
When it
works, it
is awe-inspiring.
It is also
fascinating seeing
the culture-specific
paths to the
state employed
by different
peoples who
have had a
lot of
practice.
We saw
that in
Charleston,
after the
Emanuel African
Methodist
Episcopal
Church
massacre that
left nine
African-American
parishioners
dead at the
hands of a
white supremacist
whom they
had welcomed
in.
In the days
afterward,
some of the
survivors and
their families,
publicly forgave
him and
prayed for
his soul.
I will never
be able to
hold her
again, but
I forgive
you, said
the daughter
of one of
the victims.
You hurt
me.
You hurt a
lot of
people, but
God forgives
you.
I forgive
you.
The sister-in-law
of one of the
victims faced
the shooter and
offered to
visit him in
prison in
order to pray
with him.
We saw a
different cultural
version of the
same after
another white
supremacist
opened fire
and killed
eleven people
at the
Tree of Life
synagogue in
Pittsburgh.
The shooter
was injured
in the process
and taken to
a hospital to
be cared for
by a mostly
Jewish medical
staff.
When asked
how they
managed that,
Dr. Jeff
Cohen,
president of
the hospital,
said predictable
things about
the Hippocratic
oath, but
then gave a
more revealing
explanation.
The shooter,
he said,
was a confused
man who
was easily
exploited by
online hate
groups.
The gentleman
didn't appear
to be a member
of the Mensa
Society.
And in the
aftermath of
Breivik's
attack, a
survivor who
had subsequently
become deputy
mayor of
Oslo wrote
to him,
It is my
job to see
that no one
experiences the
same social
rejection that
you did
experience.
Your fight
against social
rejection is
the only
fight we
have in
common,
Anders.
How have
you managed
not to
hate this
person?
No one
cited the
frontal cortex
or stress
hormones.
Instead, they
found more
poetic, personal
roots to the
same.
Why don't I
hate him?
Because he
has a soul,
whether it is
soiled or
not.
And God
forgives him.
Because he
is not smart
enough to know
that he's been
used and
manipulated.
Because,
starting from
childhood, he
became embittered
from loneliness,
with a desperate
need to be
accepted and
belong.
And I am
willing to
call him by
his first
name and
acknowledge that
to him.
We are all
perched on an
edge, with
head-shaking
disbelief, whether
we look back
or forward.
My guess is
that most
Norwegians view
American criminal
justice as
barbaric.
Yet, at the
same time,
most Norwegians
view it as
unattainable and
undesirable to
consider Bravik in
a context of
there being no
free will.
The early part of
his trial was
dominated by the
issue of whether
he was insane,
and the judges
showed the same
mindset critiqued
in chapter 4,
when, having
decided he was
sane, they
concluded that he
thus had free
will, would
have chosen to
do otherwise,
and was
responsible for
his actions.
One commentator,
who had moved
beyond the
Norwegians,
wrote,
If Bravik's
actions on
that fateful
Friday were
completely beyond
any free will,
then punishing
him, as
distinct from
restraining him
from further
harm to the
community, may
be as immoral
as our perception
of Bravik's
criminal acts
themselves.
Meanwhile,
Americans are
perched on a
different edge of
disbelief.
I'm going out
on a limb,
but I assumed
that most
Americans would
view a public
execution,
complete with
20,000 gawkers
and mobs of
them putting
aside their
hot dogs and
lemonade afterward
to fight over
souvenirs, as
savagery.
Yet Americans
were gobsmacked
by Bravik's
trial, beginning
with astonishment
at how it
opened with the
prosecutors shaking
Bravik's hand.
Mocking
Justice in
Norway was
the title of a
piece criticizing
the national
values that
resulted in
Bravik's
kid-glove
treatment.
One British
criminologist
began his
piece by
writing,
Anders Bravik
is a monster
who deserves
a slow and
painful death.
And on a
different edge,
no doubt some
19th century
professional hangman
would be appalled
by how justice
is mocked by
lethal injection,
but would also
think that drawing
and quartering
was a bit
beyond the pale.
The theme of
the second half
of this book
is this.
We've done it
before.
Over and over
in various
domains,
we've shown
that we can
subtract out a
belief that
actions are
freely,
willfully chosen,
as we become
more knowledgeable,
more reflective,
more modern.
And the roof
has not caved in.
Society can
function without
our believing that
people with epilepsy
are in cahoots
with Satan,
and that mothers
of people with
schizophrenia
cause the
disease by
hating their
child.
But it will be
hugely difficult
to continue this
arc, so much
so that I've
spent a lot of
the last five
years procrastinating
over this book,
because it seemed
like a waste of
time, and
because I am
endlessly reminded
about how far I
personally have to
go.
As I noted,
I've worked with
public defenders
on various murder
trials, teaching
juries about the
circumstances that
produce brains that
make horrible
decisions.
I was once asked
if I would take on
that role working
on the case of a
white supremacist,
who, a month after
attempting to burn
down a mosque,
had invaded a
synagogue and used
an assault rifle to
shoot four people,
killing one.
Whoa, I thought.
WTF?
I'm supposed to
help out with
this?
Members of my
family died in
Hitler's camps.
When I was a
kid, our synagogue
was arsoned.
My father, an
architect, rebuilt
it, and I had to
spend hours holding
one end of a tape
measure for him
amid the scorched,
acrid ruins, while
he railed on in a
near-altered state
about the history of
anti-Semitism.
When my wife
directed a production
of cabaret, with
me assisting, I
had to actively
force myself to
touch the swastika
armbands when
distributing costumes.
Given all that, I'm
supposed to help out
with this trial?
I said yes.
If I believed any
of this shit I'd
been spouting, I
had to.
And then I subtly
proved to myself how
far I still had to
go.
On these trials I've
worked on, the
lawyer has often
asked me if I
wanted to meet with
the defendant, and
I've instantly said
no.
I would have to
admit during my
testimony to having
done that, and it
would compromise my
credibility as a
teaching witness
impartially discussing
the brain.
But this time, before I
knew it, it was I who
asked these attorneys if
I could meet with the
defendant.
Was this because I
wanted to figure out
what epigenetic changes
had occurred in his
amygdala, what version
of the MAO beta gene
he possessed?
Because I wanted to
understand his personal
case of turtles all the
way down?
No.
I wanted to see close up
what the face of evil
looked like.
Perhaps when done with
the writing, I should
read this book.
It will be hard.
But we've done it
before.
I was surfing the
web, procrastinating to
avoid doing some
chore, and was
looking at one of
those sites where
people ask a question
and readers then
weigh in.
One asked,
After you've pooped,
do you wipe front to
back or back to
front?
There was a long
string of answers.
Almost everyone said
front to back.
Many doing so
emphatically.
Of those who said
front to back, most
cited their mother as
the source of that
advice.
And there it was.
Someone in Oregon and
someone continents away
in Romania writing
virtually the same
exact, unlikely
response.
When I was a kid, my
mother always told me
that if I wiped back
to front, I wouldn't
have any friends.
I was thunderstruck.
Were their mother's
identical twins separated
at birth?
Had the Oracle of
Delphi franchised so
there were now also an
Oracle of Portland and
an Oracle of Bucharest?
Why had both people
given the same bizarre
framing of advice about
personal hygiene?
Someone named Bruce
Stephan survived both the
collapse of the San
Francisco Bay Bridge
during the 1989 Loma
Prieta earthquake and
the attack on the World
Trade Center on 9-11.
Tsutomu Yamaguchi was in
both Hiroshima and
Nagasaki on the days
they were bombed, yet
lived another 65 years.
On the other hand, Pete
Best was dropped as the
Beatles drummer a few
weeks before they had
their first hit.
And Ron Wayne, who was
one of the three co-founders
of Apple Computer, didn't
enjoy working with Steve
and Woz, to show my
Silicon Valley bro-ness, and
quit after a few weeks.
Meanwhile, there's Joe
Grissimor, world record
holder for having a
mohawk that towers three
feet above his head.
What does it mean that
the universe converged on
those two mothers giving
advice to their children?
Or that Stephan and
Yamaguchi were lucky,
Best and Wayne were
arguably not, and
Grissimor lives in
Minnesota?
What does it mean that
the doctor who will
someday tell you how
many months you have
left is currently
standing in front of an
open refrigerator, eating
cold pad thai noodles?
And that Jennifer Lopez
and Ben Affleck got back
together, while Henry
VIII and Catherine of
Aragon never did?
Most fundamentally, what
does it mean that you
can look at two five-year
olds and accurately
predict which of the two
will be elderly from
diseases of despair by
age 50, and which will
be an 80-year-old having
a hip replacement in time
for ski season?
What the science in this
book ultimately teaches
is that there is no
meaning.
There's no answer to
why, beyond, this
happened because of
what came just before,
which happened because
of what came just
before that.
There is nothing but an
empty, indifferent
universe in which,
occasionally, atoms
come together temporarily
to form things we each
call me.
A whole field of
psychology explores
terror management theory,
trying to make sense of
the hodgepodge of
coping mechanisms we
resort to when facing
the inevitability and
unpredictability of
death.
As we know, those
responses cover the
range of humans at our
best and worst.
Becoming closer to your
intimates, identifying
more with your cultural
values, whether
humanitarian or fascist
in nature, making the
world a better place,
deciding to live well as
the best revenge.
And by now, in our age
of existential crisis,
the terror we feel when
shadowed by death has a
kid sibling in our terror
when shadowed by
meaninglessness.
Shadowed by our being
biological machines
wobbling on top of
turtles that go all the
way down.
We are not captains of
our ships.
Our ships never had
captains.
Fuck.
That really blows.
Which I think helps
explain a pattern.
One compatibilist
philosopher after another
reassuringly proclaims
their belief in
material, deterministic
modernity.
Yet somehow, there's
still room for free
will.
As might be kind of
clear by now, I think
that this doesn't work.
See chapters 1, 2, 3,
4, 5, 6.
I suspect that most of
them know this as well.
When you read between
the lines, or sometimes
even the lines themselves
in their writing, a lot
of these compatibilists
are actually saying that
there has to be free
will because it would be
a total downer otherwise.
Doing contortions to
make an emotional stance
seem like an
intellectual one.
Humans descended from
the apes.
Let us hope it is not
true, but if it is, let
us pray that it will not
become generally known,
said the wife of an
Anglican bishop in 1860
when told about Darwin's
novel theory of
evolution.
156 years later, Stephen
Cave titled a much
discussed June 2016
article in The Atlantic,
There's no such thing as
free will, but we're
better off believing in
it anyway.
He just might be right.
Chapter 2 discussed a
study in which a sense of
illusory will could be
induced in people.
One subgroup of
subjects, however, was
resistant to this,
individuals with
clinical depression.
Depression is often
framed as a sufferer
having a cognitively
distorted sense of
learned helplessness,
where the reality of
some loss in the past
becomes mistakenly
perceived as an
inevitable future.
In this study,
though, it was not
that depressed
individuals were
cognitively distorted,
underestimating their
actual control.
Instead, they were
accurate compared with
everyone else's
overestimates.
Findings like these
support the view that
in some circumstances,
depressed individuals
are not distortive,
but are sadder but
wiser.
As such, depression is
the pathological loss
of the capacity to
rationalize away
reality.
And thus, perhaps,
we're better off
believing in it
anyway.
Truth doesn't
always set you
free.
Truth, mental
health, and
well-being have a
complex relationship,
something explored in
an extensive literature
on the psychology of
stress.
Expose a test subject
to a series of
unpredictable shocks,
and she will
activate a stress
response.
If you warn her
ten seconds before
each shock that it
is coming,
the stress response
is lessened,
as truth girds
predictability,
giving time to
prepare a coping
response.
Give a warning one
second before each
shock, and there's
too little time for
an effect.
But give a warning
one minute before,
and the stress
response is worsened,
as that minute
stretches into
feeling a year's
worth of
anticipatory dread.
Thus, truthful
predictive information
can lessen,
worsen, or have no
effect on
psychological stress,
depending on the
circumstances.
Researchers have
explored another
facet of our
complex relationship
with truth.
If someone's actions
have produced a
mildly adverse
outcome,
truthfully emphasizing
the control he had,
think how much worse
things could have
been.
Good thing you had
control,
blunts his stress
response.
But if someone's
actions have produced
a disastrous outcome,
untruthfully emphasizing
the opposite,
no one could have
stopped the car in
time, the way that
child darted out,
can be deeply
humane.
The truth can even
be life-threatening.
Someone teetering on
the edge of death
in the ER,
90% of their body
covered in third-degree
burns,
gathers their strength
to ask in a whisper
whether the rest of
their family is okay,
and most medical
professionals would be
mighty torn about
telling the person
the shattering truth.
As some evolutionary
biologists have
pointed out,
the only way humans
have survived amid
being able to
understand truths
about life is by
having evolved a
robust capacity for
self-deception.
And this certainly
includes a belief in
free will.
Despite that,
I obviously think
that we should face
the music about our
uncaptained ships.
This, of course,
has some substantial
downsides.
What you'd give up
along with free will
The most immediate
area of distress
is consistently
the running-amuck
challenge,
returning to
chapter 11.
For Gilberto Gomez,
rejection of the
idea of free will
leaves us with an
incomprehensible
picture of the
human world,
since there is no
responsibility or
moral obligation in it.
If one could not
have done otherwise,
it cannot be the
case that one
ought to have done
otherwise.
Michael Gazzaniga
recoils from
rejecting free will
and responsibility
because people have
to be held
accountable for their
actions, their
participation.
Without that rule,
nothing works.
And where the only
thing that might
constrain behavior is
people not wanting
to hang out with
you if you run
amuck in particularly
unwelcome ways.
According to
Daniel Dennett,
if there were no
belief in free will,
there would be no
rights, no recourse
to authority to
protect against
fraud, theft,
rape, murder.
In short, no
morality.
Do you really want
to return humanity
to the 17th century
English philosopher
Thomas Hobbes'
state of nature,
where life is
nasty, brutish,
and short?
Dennett badmouths
neuroscientists along
these lines by
frequently telling his
parable of the
nefarious neurosurgeon.
The surgeon does
some procedure on a
patient.
Afterward, because,
hey, why not, she
lies to him, claiming
that during surgery
she also implanted a
chip in his brain
that robs him of
free will, that she
and her fellow
scientists now control
him, unburdened by a
sense of being
responsible for his
actions anymore,
unconstrained by
norms of trust that
make for the social
contract, the man
becomes a criminal.
That's what
neuroscientists do,
concludes Dennett,
nefariously and
irresponsibly lying to
people about how they
have no free will.
Thus, along with the
terrors of mortality
and of meaninglessness,
there's the terror that
there's a nasty,
brutish, short
murderer standing
behind you in line
at Starbucks.
As we've seen,
rejection of free
will doesn't doom
you to break bad,
not if you've been
educated about the
roots of where our
behavior comes from.
Trouble is, that
requires education,
and even that doesn't
guarantee a good
moral outcome.
After all, most
Americans have been
educated to believe in
free will, and have
reflected on how this
produces responsibility
for our actions.
And most have also
been taught to believe
in a moralizing God,
guaranteeing that your
actions have
consequences.
And yet, our rates of
violence are unmatched
in the West.
We're doing plenty of
running amok as it is.
Maybe we should call
this one a draw, and,
based on the sorts of
findings reviewed in
chapter 11, conclude at
least that rejection of
free will is unlikely to
make things worse.
Rejecting free will has
an additional downside.
If there's no free will,
you don't deserve praise
for your accomplishments,
you haven't earned or
are entitled to anything.
Then it feels this.
Not only will the streets
be overrun with rapists
and murderers if we junk
free will, but in
addition, no one would
deserve to receive the
prize they competed for
in good faith and won.
Oh, that worry, that your
prizes will feel empty.
In my experience, it's
going to be plenty hard
to convince people that
a remorseless murderer
doesn't deserve blame,
but that's going to be
dwarfed by the difficulty
of convincing people that
they themselves don't
deserve to be praised if
they've helped that old
woman cross the street.
That problem with
rejecting free will seems
legit, if rarefied.
We'll return to this.
For me, the biggest
problem with accepting
that there's no free
will takes the
nefarious neurosurgeon
parable down a different
path.
The surgery is done, and
the surgeon lies to the
patient about no longer
having free will.
And rather than falling
into mundane criminality,
the patient falls into
profound malaise and
enervation because of the
pointlessness.
In the short story,
What's Expected of Us,
Ted Chang takes a cue from
Libet, writing about a
gizmo called the
predictor, with a button
and a light.
Whenever you press the
button, the light goes on
a second before.
No matter what you do,
no matter how much you
try not to think about
pressing the button,
strategize to sneak up on
it, the light comes on a
second before you press
the button.
In the moment between the
light coming on and you're
supposedly freely choosing
to press the button,
your future action is
already a determined past.
The result?
People are hollowed out.
Some people, realizing
that their choices don't
matter, refuse to make
any choices at all.
Like a legion of Bartleby
the Scriveners, they no
longer engage in
spontaneous action.
Eventually, a third of
those who play with a
predictor must be
hospitalized because they
don't feed themselves.
The end state is
akinetic mutism, a kind of
walking coma.
It's that yawning chasm
where, amid this happened
because of what came
before, which happened
because of what came
before that, there's no
place for meaning or
purpose, which haunts
philosophers, along with
the rest of us.
Ryan Lake of Clemson
University writes that
rejecting belief in free
will would make sincere
regret or apology
impossible, robbing us of
an essential component of
our relationships with
others.
Peter Tze writes,
I find a leading
incompatibilist's denial of
moral responsibility a
profoundly nihilistic view
of human beings, their
choices, and life in
general.
Philosopher Robert Bishop
of Wheaton College, in
dissecting Dennett's
thinking, concludes that
he believes that the
consoling perspective he
offers is the only way for
any of us to maintain a
healthy, affirmative outlook
on life and remain
meaningfully engaged in
it.
Life lived as if viewed
through free will.
Colored glasses.
This one looms over us.
Evolution, chaos,
emergence have taken the
most unexpected turns in
us, producing biological
machines that can know our
machineness and whose
emotional responses to that
knowledge feel real, are
real.
Pain is painful.
Happiness makes life
frabjous.
I try to ruthlessly hold
myself to the implications
of all this turtling, and
sometimes I even succeed.
But there is one tiny
foothold of illogic that I
can't overcome for even a
millisecond, to my
intellectual shame and
personal gratitude.
It is logically indefensible,
ludicrous, meaningless to
believe that something good
can happen to a machine.
Nonetheless, I am certain
that it is good if people
feel less pain and more
happiness.
Despite these various
downsides, I think that it is
essential that we face our
lack of free will.
It may look now like we're
heading for a major anti-climax
for this book, one that is
about as appealing as
subsisting on locusts.
This is how the world
works.
Suck it up.
Sure, if you have a burned
patient on the edge of
death, probably hold off on
telling them that their
family didn't survive.
But otherwise, it's usually
good to go with the truth,
especially about free will.
Faith can sustain, but
nothing devastates as surely
as the discovery that your
deeply held faith has been
misplaced all along.
We claim we're rational
beings, so go ahead and
prove it.
Deal.
But toughen up, there's no
free will, isn't remotely
the point.
Maybe you're deflated by the
realization that part of your
success in life is due to
the fact that your face has
appealing features.
Or that your praiseworthy
self-discipline has much to do
with how your cortex was
constructed when you were a
fetus.
That someone loves you because
of, say, how their oxytocin
receptors work.
That you and the other
machines don't have meaning.
If these generate malaise in
you, it means one thing that
trumps everything else.
You are one of the lucky ones.
You are privileged enough to
have success in life that was
not of your own doing, and to
cloak yourself with myths of
freely-willed choices.
Heck, it probably means that
you've both found love and
have clean running water.
That your town wasn't once a
prosperous place where people
manufactured things, but is
now filled with shuttered
factories and no jobs.
That you didn't grow up in the
sort of neighborhood where it
was nearly impossible to just
say no to drugs because there
were so few healthy things to
say yes to.
That your mother wasn't
working three jobs and barely
making the rent when she was
pregnant with you.
That a pounding on the door
isn't from ice.
That when you encounter a
stranger, their insula and
amygdala don't activate because
you belong to an out-group.
That when you are truly in need,
you're not ignored.
If you are among these lucky,
very, very few, the ultimate
implications of this book.
