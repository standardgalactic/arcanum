in the habitual way, when you're supposed to be doing it, in a novel manner.
Sit someone in front of a computer and say to them,
here's the rule, when a blue light flashes on the screen,
hit the button on the left as fast as possible.
Red light, hit the button on the right.
Have them do that a bunch of times, get the hang of it.
Now, reverse that.
Blue light, button on the right.
Red, left.
Have them do that a while.
Now switch back again.
Each time the rule changes, the PFC is in charge of,
remember, blue now means?
Now, quick, say the months of the year backward.
The PFC activates, suppressing the over-learned response.
Remember, September-August this time, not September-October.
More frontal activation predicts a better performance here.
One of the best ways to appreciate these frontal functions
is to examine people with a damaged PFC,
as after certain types of strokes or dementias.
There are huge problems with reversal tasks like these.
It's too hard to do that right thing when it is a change from the usual.
Thus, the PFC is for learning a new rule or a new variant of a rule.
Implied in that is that the functioning of the PFC can change.
Once that novel rule persists and has stopped being novel,
it becomes the task of other, more automatic brain circuitry.
Few of us need to activate the PFC to pee nowhere but in the bathroom.
But we sure did when we were three.
Doing the right thing requires two different skills from the PFC.
There's sending the decisive,
do this signal along the path from the PFC to the frontal cortex,
to the supplementary motor area,
the SMA of Chapter 2,
to the motor cortex.
But even more important, there is the
and don't do that, even if that's the usual,
signal.
Even more than sending excitatory signals to the motor cortex,
the PFC is about
inhibiting habitual brain circuits.
To hark back again to Chapter 2,
the PFC is central to showing that we lack both free will
and the conscious veto power of free won't.
The Social PFC
Obviously,
the crowning achievement of millions of years of frontocortical evolution
is not reciting months backward.
It's social.
It's suppressing the emotionally easier thing to do.
The PFC is the center of our social brain.
The bigger the average size of the social group in a primate species,
the greater a percentage of the brain is devoted to the PFC.
The bigger the size of some humans' texting network,
the larger a particular sub-region of the PFC,
and its connectivity with the limbic system.
So, does sociality enlarge the PFC?
Or does a large PFC drive sociality?
At least partially the former.
Take individually housed monkeys
and put them together in big, complex social groups,
and a year later,
everyone's PFC will have enlarged.
Moreover,
the individual who emerges at the top of the hierarchy
shows the largest increase.
Neuroimaging studies show the PFC
reining in more emotional brain regions
in the name of doing,
or thinking,
the right thing.
Stick a volunteer in a brain scanner
and flash up pictures of faces.
And in a depressing,
well-replicated finding,
flash up the face of someone of another race,
and in about 75% of subjects,
there is activation of the amygdala,
the brain region central to fear,
anxiety,
and aggression,
in under a tenth of a second.
And then the PFC does the harder thing.
In most of those subjects,
a few seconds after the amygdala activates,
the PFC kicks in,
turning off the amygdala.
It's a delayed frontocortical voice.
Don't think that way.
That's not who I am.
And who are the folks
in which the PFC doesn't muzzle the amygdala?
People whose racism is avowedly,
unapologetically explicit.
That is who I am.
In another experimental paradigm,
a subject in a brain scanner
plays an online game with two other people.
Each is represented by a symbol on the screen,
forming a triangle.
They toss a virtual ball around.
The subject presses one of two buttons,
determining which of the two symbols
the ball is tossed to.
The other two toss it to each other,
toss it back to the subject.
This goes on for a while,
everyone having a fine time.
And then,
oh no,
the other two people
stop tossing the ball to the subject.
It's the middle school nightmare.
They know I'm a dork.
The amygdala rapidly activates,
along with the insular cortex,
a region associated with disgust and distress.
And then,
after a delay,
the PFC inhibits these other regions.
Get this in perspective.
This is just a stupid game.
In a subset of individuals, however,
the PFC doesn't activate as much,
and the amygdala and insular cortex
just keep going,
as the subject feels more subjective distress.
Who are these impaired individuals?
Teenagers.
The PFC isn't up to the task yet
of dismissing social ostracism
as meaningless.
There you have it.
More of the PFC reining in the amygdala.
Give a volunteer a mild shock now and then.
The amygdala majorly wakes up each time.
Now, condition the volunteer.
Just before each shock,
show them a picture of some object
with completely neutral associations.
Say,
a pot,
a pan,
a broom,
or a hat.
Soon,
the mere sight of that previously innocuous object
activates the amygdala.
The next day,
show the subject a picture of that object
that activates a conditioned fear response in them.
Amygdala activation.
Except today,
there's no shock.
Do it again and again.
Each time,
no shock.
And slowly,
you extinguish the fear response.
The amygdala stops reacting.
Unless the PFC isn't working.
Yesterday,
it was the amygdala that learned,
brooms are scary.
Today,
it is the PFC that learns,
but not today,
and calms down
the amygdala.
More insight into the PFC
comes from brilliant studies
by neuroscientist
Josh Green of Harvard.
Subjects in a brain scanner
play repeated rounds
of a chance guessing game
with a 50% success rate.
Then comes the fiendishly clever manipulation.
Tell subjects there's been a computer glitch
so that they can't enter their guess.
That's okay,
they're told.
We'll show you the answer,
and you can just tell us
whether you were right.
In other words,
an opportunity to cheat.
Throw in enough of those
there goes that computer glitch again
opportunities,
and you can tell
if someone starts cheating.
Their success rate
averages above 50%.
What happens in the brains
of cheaters
when temptation arises?
Massive activation of the PFC,
the neural equivalent
of the person wrestling
with whether to cheat.
And then for the profound
additional finding.
What about the people
who never cheated?
How do they do it?
Maybe their astonishingly strong PFC
pins Satan to the mat each time.
Major willpower.
But that's not what happens.
In those folks,
the PFC doesn't stir.
At some point after
don't pee in your pants
no longer required the PFC
to flex its muscles,
an equivalent happened
in such individuals,
generating an automatic
I don't cheat.
As framed by Green,
rather than withstanding
the siren call of sin
thanks to will,
this instead represents
a state of
grace.
Doing the right thing
isn't the harder thing.
The frontal cortex
reigns in
inappropriate behavior
in additional ways.
One example
involves a brain region
called the striatum
that has to do
with automatic,
habitual behaviors,
exactly the sort of things
that the amygdala
can take advantage of
by activating.
The PFC
sends inhibitory projections
to the striatum
as a backup plan.
I warned the amygdala
not to do it,
but if that hothead
does it anyway,
don't listen to it.
What happens to social behavior
if the PFC is damaged?
A syndrome of
frontal disinhibition.
We all have thoughts,
hateful,
lustful,
boastful,
petulant.
We'd be mortified
if anyone knew.
Be frontally disinhibited
and you say
and do exactly
those things.
When one of those
diseases occurs
in an 80-year-old,
it's off to a neurologist.
When one of those
diseases occurs
in a 50-year-old,
it's usually a psychiatrist
or the police.
As it turns out,
a substantial percentage
of people incarcerated
for violent crime
have a history
of concussive head trauma
to the PFC.
Cognition vs. Emotion
Cognition & Emotion
or Cognition
Via Emotion
Thus,
the frontal cortex
isn't just this cerebral,
egg-heady brain region
weighing the pluses
and minuses
of each decision,
sending nice,
rational,
libetian commands
to the motor cortex.
That is,
an excitatory role.
It's also an inhibitory,
rule-bound goody-goody
telling more emotional
parts of the brain
not to do something
because they're going
to regret it.
And basically,
those other brain regions
think of the PFC
as this moralizing pain
with a stick up its butt,
especially when it turns out
to be right.
This generates
a dichotomy.
Spoiler alert,
it's false,
that there is a major
fault line between
thought and emotion,
between the cortex,
captained by the PFC,
and the part of the brain
that processes emotions,
broadly called
the limbic system,
containing the amygdala
along with other structures
related to sexual arousal,
maternal behavior,
sadness,
pleasure,
aggression.
A picture of a war of wills
between the PFC
and the limbic system
certainly makes sense
by now.
After all,
it's the former
telling the latter
to stop those
implicit racist thoughts,
to put a stupid game
in perspective,
to resist cheating.
And it's the latter
that runs wild
with crazy stuff
when the PFC
is silent,
that is,
during REM sleep,
when you're dreaming.
But it's not always
the two regions
of wrestling.
Sometimes,
they simply have
different purviews.
The PFC
handles April 15th.
The limbic system,
February 14th.
The former
makes you grudgingly
respect
into the woods.
The latter
makes you tearful
during Les Mis,
despite knowing
that you're being
manipulated.
The former
is engaged
when juries
decide guilt
or innocence.
The latter,
when they decide
how much
to punish
the guilty.
But,
and this is
a truly key point,
rather than
the PFC
and limbic system
either being
in opposition
or ignoring
each other,
they are usually
intertwined.
In order to do
the correct,
harder thing,
the PFC
requires a huge
amount of
limbic,
emotional input.
To appreciate this,
we must sink
deeper into
minutiae,
considering
two subregions
of the PFC.
The first
is the
dorsolateral
PFC,
DLPFC,
the definitive
rational decider
in the frontal cortex.
Like a Russian
nesting doll,
the cortex
is the newest
part of the brain
to evolve.
The frontal cortex
is the newest
part of the cortex.
The PFC
is the newest
part of the
frontal cortex.
And the
DLPFC
is the newest
part of the
PFC.
The DLPFC
is the last
part of the
PFC
to fully
mature.
The DLPFC
is the essence
of the PFC
as tight-assed
superego.
It's the most
active part of the
PFC during
count-the-months-backward
tasks,
or when considering
temptation.
It is fiercely
utilitarian.
More DLPFC
activity during
a moral judgment
task predicts
that the subject
chooses to kill
an innocent
person to
save five.
What happens
when the
DLPFC is
silenced
is really
informative.
This can be
done experimentally
with an immensely
cool technique
called
transcranial
magnetic
stimulation,
TMS,
introduced earlier,
in which a
strong magnetic
pulse to the
scalp can
temporarily
activate or
inactivate the
small patch of
cortex just
below.
Activate the
DLPFC this
way, and
subjects become
more utilitarian
in deciding to
sacrifice one
to save many.
Inactivate the
DLPFC, and
subjects become
more impulsive.
They read a
lousy offer in an
economic game as
unfair, but lack
the self-control
needed to hold
out for a better
reward.
This is all
about sociality.
Manipulating the
DLPFC has no
effect of
subjects think
their opponent
is a computer.
Then there are
people who have
sustained selective
damage to their
DLPFC.
The outcome is
just what you'd
expect.
Impaired planning
or gratification
postponement.
Perseveration on
strategies that
offer immediate
reward.
Plus, poor
executive control
over socially
inappropriate
behavior.
A brain with
no voice saying,
I wouldn't do
that if I were
you.
The other key
sub-region of
the PFC is
called the
ventromedial
PFC, VM
PFC, and
to savagely
simplify, it's
the opposite of
the DLPFC.
That cerebral
DLPFC is
mostly getting
inputs from
other cortical
regions, canvassing
the outer
districts to
find out their
well-considered
thoughts.
But the
VMPFC carries
in information
from the
limbic system,
that brain
region that's
swoony or
overwrought with
emotion.
The VMPFC is
how the PFC
finds out what
you're feeling.
What happens
if the VMPFC
is damaged?
Great things,
if you're not
big on emotion.
For that crowd,
we are at our
best when we
are rational,
optimizing machines,
picking our way
to our best
moral decisions.
In this view,
the limbic system
gums up decision
making by being
all sentimental,
sings too loud,
dresses flamboyantly,
has unsettling
amounts of
armpit hair.
In this view,
if we just
could get rid
of the VMPFC,
we'd be calmer,
more rational,
and function
better.
As a deeply
significant finding,
someone with
VMPFC damage
makes terrible
decisions,
but of a very
different type
from those
with DLPFC
damage.
For starters,
people with
VMPFC damage
have trouble
making decisions
because they're
not getting gut
feelings about
how they should
decide.
When we are
making a decision,
the DLPFC
is musing
philosophically,
running thought
experiments about
what decision
to make.
What the
VMPFC is
reporting to
the DLPFC
are the results
of a feel
experiment.
How will I
feel if I do
X and
Z then
happens?
And without
that gut-feeling
input,
it's immensely
hard to make
decisions.
Moreover,
the decisions
made can be
wrong by
anyone's standards.
People with
VMPFC damage
don't shift
their behavior
based on
negative feedback.
Suppose subjects
are repeatedly
choosing between
two tasks,
one of which
is more rewarding.
Switch which
task is the
more rewarding
one,
and people
typically shift
their strategy
accordingly,
even if they're
not consciously
aware of the
change in
reward rates.
But with
VMPFC damage,
the person can
even say that
it's the other
task that is
now more
rewarding,
while sticking
with the
previous task.
Without a
VMPFC,
you still know
what negative
feedback means,
but not how
it feels.
As we saw,
DLPFC damage
produces
inappropriate,
emotionally
disinhibited
behaviors.
But without
a VMPFC,
you desiccate
into heartless
detachment.
This is the
person who,
meeting someone,
says,
Hello,
good to meet
you.
I see that
you're quite
overweight.
And when
castigated later
by their
mortified partner,
will ask with
calm puzzlement,
What's wrong?
It's true.
Unlike most
people,
those with
VMPFC damage
don't advocate
harsher punishment
for violent
versus non-violent
crimes,
don't alter
gameplay if
they think
they're playing
against a
computer rather
than a human,
and don't
distinguish between
a loved one
and a stranger
when deciding
whether to
sacrifice them
in order to
save five
people.
The VMPFC
is not the
vestigial appendix
of the PFC,
where emotion is
like appendicitis,
inflaming a
sensible brain.
Instead,
it's essential.
So the
PFC does
the harder
thing when
it's the
right thing
to do.
But as a
crucial point,
right is
used in a
neurobiological
and instrumental
sense rather
than a moral
one.
Consider lying
and the obvious
role the
PFC plays in
resisting the
temptation to
lie.
But you also
use the
PFC to
lie competently.
Pathological
liars, for
example, have
atypically complex
wiring in the
PFC.
Moreover, lying
competently is
value-free,
amoral.
A child
schooled in
situational
ethics lies
about how she
loves the
dinner that
grandma made.
A Buddhist
monk plays
liar's dice
superbly.
A dictator
fabricates the
occurrence of a
massacre as an
excuse to
invade a country.
The spawn of
Ponzi defrauds
investors.
As with much
about the
frontal cortex,
it's context,
context,
context.
With this
tour of the
PFC complete,
we return to
the hideously
destructive false
dichotomy between
your attributes,
those natural
gifts and
weaknesses that
you just happen
to have, and
your supposedly
freely chosen
choices as to
what you do
with those
attributes.
Biological
stuff.
Do you have
grit?
Having destructive
sexual urges?
Do you resist
acting upon
them?
Being a
natural
marathoner?
Do you fight
through the
pain?
Not being all
that bright?
Do you triumph
by studying
extra hard?
Having a
proclivity toward
alcoholism?
Do you order
ginger ale
instead?
Having a
beautiful face?
Do you resist
concluding that
you're entitled to
people being nice
to you because
of it?
The Same
Exact Stuff
Consider once
again the
actions just
mentioned, those
crossroads that
test our
mettle.
Do you resist
acting on your
destructive sexual
urges?
Do you fight
through the
pain?
Work extra
hard to overcome
your weaknesses?
You can see
where this is
heading.
If you want to
finish this
paragraph and
then skip the
rest of the
chapter, here
are the three
punchlines.
A. Grit,
character,
backbone,
tenacity,
strong moral
compass,
willing spirit
winning out
over weak
flesh, are
all produced
by the
PFC.
B. The
PFC is
made of
biological
stuff identical
to the rest
of your
brain.
C. Your
current PFC
is the
outcome of
all that
uncontrollable
biology interacting
with all that
uncontrollable
environment.
Chapter
three explored
the biological
answer to
the question
why did
that behavior
just occur?
The answer
being because
of what came
a second
before and
a minute
before and
now we ask
the more
focused question
of why
that PFC
functioned the
way it did
just now
and it's
the same
answer.
the legacy
of the
preceding
seconds
to an
hour.
You sit
there alert
on task.
Each time
the blue
light comes
on you
rapidly hit
the button
on the
left.
Red
light,
button on
the right.
Then the
rule reverses.
Blue,
right,
red,
left.
Then it
reverses
again and
then again.
What's
going on
in your
brain
during this
task?
Each time
a light
flashes,
your visual
cortex briefly
activates.
An instant
later,
there's brief
activation of
the pathway
carrying that
information from
the visual
cortex to
the PFC.
An instant
later,
the pathways
from there
to your
motor cortex
and then
from your
motor cortex
to your
muscles
activate your
motor cortex
to your
muscles.
What's
happening
in the
PFC?
It's
sitting
there
having
to focus
repeating
blue
left,
red
right,
or blue
right,
red
left.
It's
working
hard
the
entire
time
chanting
which
rule
is
in
effect.
When
you're
trying
to do
the
right
harder
thing,
the
PFC
becomes
the
most
expensive
part
of
the
brain.
Expensive,
nice
metaphor,
but it's
not a
metaphor.
Any
given
neuron
in the
PFC
is firing
nonstop,
each
action
potential
triggering
waves of
ions
flowing
across
membranes
and then
having to
be corralled
and pumped
back to
where they
started.
And those
action
potentials can
occur a
hundred times
a second
while you're
concentrating on
the rule
that is now
in place.
Those
PFC neurons
consume mammoth
amounts of
energy.
You can
demonstrate this
with brain
imaging techniques,
showing how a
working PFC
consumes tons of
glucose and
oxygen from
the bloodstream
or by
measuring how
much
biochemical
cash is
available in
each neuron
at any
given time.
Which leads
to the main
point of
this section.
When the
PFC doesn't
have enough
energy on
board,
it doesn't
work well.
This is the
cellular
underpinning of
concepts like
cognitive
load or
cognitive
reserve,
alluded to
in chapter
three.
As your
PFC works
hard on a
task,
those reserves
are depleted.
For example,
place a bowl
of M&Ms in
front of
someone dieting.
Here,
have all you
want.
They're trying
to resist.
And if the
person has
just done
something
frontally
demanding,
even some
idiotically
irrelevant
red light
blue light
task,
the person
snacks on
more candy
than usual.
In the
words of
part of the
charming title
of a paper
on the
subject,
deplete us
not into
temptation.
Same
thing in
reverse.
Deplete
frontal
reserve by
sitting for
15 minutes
resisting those
M&Ms,
and afterward,
you'll be
lousy at
red light
blue light.
PFC
function and
self-regulation
go down the
tubes if
you're terrified
or in pain.
The PFC is
using up energy
dealing with
the stress.
Recall the
Macbeth effect,
where reflecting
on something
unethical you
once did
impairs
frontal
cognition,
unless you've
relieved yourself
of that
burdensome
soiling by
washing your
hands.
Frontal
competence
even declines
if it's
keeping you
from being
distracted by
something
positive.
Patients
are more
likely to
die as
a result
of surgery
if it
is the
surgeon's
birthday.
Fatigue
also depletes
frontal
resources.
As the
workday
progresses,
doctors take
the easier
way out,
ordering up
fewer tests,
being more
likely to
prescribe
opiates,
but not
a non-problematic
drug like
an anti-inflammatory
or physical
therapy.
Subjects are
more likely to
behave unethically
and become
less morally
reflective as
the day
progresses,
or after
they've
struggled with
a cognitively
challenging
task.
In an
immensely
unsettling
study of
emergency room
doctors,
the more
cognitively
demanding the
workday,
as measured
by patient
load,
the higher
the levels
of implicit
racial bias
by the
end of
the day.
It's the
same with
hunger.
Here's one
study that
should stop
you in
your tracks,
and was
first referred
to in the
last chapter.
The researchers
studied a group
of judges
overseeing more
than a thousand
parole board
decisions.
What best
predicted whether
a judge granted
someone parole
versus more
jail time?
how long
it had been
since they
had eaten
a meal?
Appear before
the judge
soon after
she's had
a meal,
and there
was a
roughly
65% chance
of parole.
Appear a
few hours
after a
meal,
and there
was close
to a
0% chance.
What's that
about?
It's not like
judges would
get lightheaded
by late
afternoon,
slurring
their words,
getting all
confused,
and jailing
the court
stenographer.
Nobel laureate
psychologist
Daniel Kahneman,
in discussing
this study,
suggests that
as the hours
since a meal
creep by,
and the
PFC becomes
less adept at
focusing on
the details
of each case,
the judge
becomes more
likely to
default into
the easiest,
most reflexive
thing,
which is
sending the
person back
to jail.
Important
support for
this idea
comes from
a study in
which subjects
had to make
judgments of
increasing
complexity.
As this
progressed,
the more
sluggish the
DLPFC became
during deliberating,
the more likely
subjects were to
fall back on
a habitual
decision.
Why is denying
parole the
easy,
habitual response
to fall back
on?
Because it's
less demanding
of the PFC.
Someone is
facing you
who has done
bad things
but has been
behaving himself
in jail.
It takes a
mighty energetic
PFC to try
to understand,
to feel,
what the
prisoner's
life,
filled with
horrible luck,
has been
like.
To view the
world from
his perspective,
to search
his face
and see
those hints
of change
and potential
beneath the
toughness.
It takes a
lot of
frontal effort
for a judge
to walk in
a prisoner's
shoes before
deciding on
his parole.
And reflecting
that,
across all
those judicial
decisions,
judges averaged
a longer
length of
time before
deciding to
parole the
person rather
than before
sending them
back to
jail.
Thus,
events in
the world
around you
will be
modulating the
ability of
your PFC to
resist those
M&Ms for a
quick, easy
judicial decision.
Another relevant
factor is the
brain chemistry
of just how
tempting the
temptation is.
This has a
lot to do with
the neurotransmitter
dopamine being
released into
the PFC from
neurons originating
back in the
nucleus accumbens
in the limbic
system.
What is the
dopamine doing
in the PFC?
Signaling the
salience of a
temptation.
How much your
neurons are
imagining how
great M&Ms
taste?
The more of a
dopamine dump
in the PFC,
the stronger the
salience signal of
the temptation,
the more of a
challenge it is
for the PFC to
resist.
Boost dopamine
levels in your
PFC, and
you'll suddenly
have trouble
keeping a lid
on your
impulses.
And exactly as
you'd expect,
there's a whole
world of factors
out of your
control influencing
the amount of
dopamine that is
going to be
soaking your
PFC.
That is,
understanding the
dopamine system
also requires a
one-second-before,
one-century-before
analysis.
In those seconds
to hours before,
sensory information
modulates PFC
function without
your awareness.
Have a subject
smell a vial of
sweat from someone
frightened, and
her amygdala
activates, making
it harder for the
PFC to rein it
in.
How's this for
rapidly altering
frontal function?
Take an average
heterosexual male and
expose him to a
particular stimulus,
and his PFC becomes
more likely to
decide that jaywalking
is a good idea.
What's the
stimulus?
The proximity of
an attractive woman.
I know.
Pathetic.
Thus, all sorts of
things often out of
your control, stress,
pain, hunger, fatigue,
whose sweat you're
smelling, who's in
your peripheral vision,
can modulate how
effectively your PFC
does its job,
usually without your
knowing it's happening.
No judge, if asked
why she just made
her judicial decision,
cites her blood
glucose levels.
Instead, we're going
to hear a philosophical
discourse about some
bearded dead guy in a
toga.
To ask a question
derived from the
last chapter, do
findings like these
prove that there's
no such thing as
freely chosen grit?
Even if the sizes of
these effects were
enormous, which they
rarely are, although
65% versus nearly 0%
parole rates in the
judge-slash-hunger
study sure isn't
minor, not on their
own, we now zoom out
more.
The legacy of the
preceding hours to
days.
This lands us in the
realm of what hormones
have been doing to the
PFC when you need to
show what would be
interpreted as some
agentic grit.
As a reminder from
the last chapters,
elevations of
testosterone during
this time frame make
people more impulsive,
more self-confident
and risk-taking,
more self-centered,
less generous or
empathic, and more
likely to react
aggressively to a
provocation.
Glucocorticoids and
stress make people
poor at executive
function and impulse
control and more
likely to perseverate on
a habitual response to
a challenge that isn't
working, instead of
changing strategies.
Then there's
oxytocin, which
enhances trust,
sociality, and
social recognition.
Estrogen enhances
executive function,
working memory, and
impulse control, and
makes people better at
rapidly switching tasks
when needed.
Lots of these
hormonal effects play
out in the PFC.
Have a horribly
stressed morning, and
by noon, glucocorticoids
will have changed
gene expression in
the DLPFC, making
it less excitable and
less able to couple
to the amygdala and
calm it down.
Meanwhile, stress and
glucocorticoids make
that emotional VM
PFC more excitable and
more impervious to
negative feedback about
social behavior.
Stress also causes
release in the PFC of a
neurotransmitter called
norepinephrine, sort of
the brain's equivalent of
adrenaline, which also
disrupts the DLPFC.
In that time span,
testosterone will have
changed the expression of
genes and neurons in
another part of the PFC,
called the orbitofrontal
cortex, making them more
sensitive to an
inhibitory neurotransmitter,
quieting the neurons, and
decreasing their ability to
talk sense to the limbic
system.
Testosterone also reduces
the coupling between one
part of the PFC and a
region implicated in
empathy.
This helps explain why the
hormone makes people less
accurate at assessing
someone's emotions by
looking at their eyes.
Meanwhile, oxytocin has its
prosocial effects by
strengthening the
orbitofrontal cortex and
by changing the rates at
which the VM PFC utilizes
the neurotransmitters,
serotonin, and dopamine.
Then there's estrogen, which
not only increases the
number of receptors for
the neurotransmitter
acetylcholine, but even
changes the structure of
neurons in the VM PFC.
Please tell me that you
haven't been writing down
and starting to memorize
these factoids.
The point is the
mechanistic nature of all
this.
Depending on where you are
in your ovulatory cycle,
if it's in the middle of the
night or day, if someone
gave you a wonderful hug
that's left you still
tingling, or someone
gave you a threatening
ultimatum that's left you
still trembling, gears and
widgets in your PFC will be
working differently, and, as
before, rarely with large
enough effects, dispel doom
for the myth of grit all on
their own.
Just another piece.
The Legacy of the Proceeding
Days to Years
Chapter 3 covered how, over
this time span, the structure
and function of the brain can
change dramatically.
Recall how years of
depression can cause the
hippocampus to atrophy, how
the sort of trauma that
produces PTSD can enlarge the
amygdala.
Naturally, neuroplasticity in
response to experience occurs in
the PFC as well, suffer from
major depression, or, to a
lesser extent, a major anxiety
disorder for years, and the
PFC atrophies.
The longer the mood disorder
persists, the greater the
atrophy.
Prolonged stress, or exposure to
stress levels of glucocorticoids,
accomplishes the same.
The hormone suppresses the level or
efficacy of a key neuronal
growth factor called BDNF in the
PFC, causing dendritic spines and
dendritic branches to retract so
much that the layers of the PFC
thin out.
This impairs PFC function,
including a really unhelpful twist.
As noted when activated, the amygdala
helps initiate the body's stress
response, including the secretion of
glucocorticoids.
The PFC works to end this stress
response by calming down the
amygdala.
Elevated glucocorticoid levels
impair PFC function.
The PFC isn't as good at calming the
amygdala, resulting in the person
secreting ever higher levels of
glucocorticoids, which then impair.
A vicious cycle.
The list of other regulators stretches
out.
Estrogen causes PFC neurons to form
thicker, more complex branches
connecting to other neurons.
Remove estrogen entirely, and some
PFC neurons die.
Alcohol abuse destroys neurons in that
orbitofrontal cortex, causing it to
shrink.
The more shrinkage, the more likely an
abstinent alcoholic is to relapse.
Chronic cannabis use decreases blood flow
and activity in both the DLPFC and the
VMPFC.
Exercise aerobically on a regular basis,
and genes related to neurotransmitter
signaling are turned on in the PFC.
More BDNF growth factor is made, and
coupling of activity among various PFC
subregions becomes tighter and more
efficient.
Roughly the opposite happens with eating
disorders.
The list goes on and on.
Some of these effects are subtle.
If you want to see something unsubtle, watch
what happens days to years after the PFC is
damaged by a traumatic brain injury.
TBI, a la Phineas gauge, or
frontotemporal dementia redux.
Extensive damage to the PFC increases the
likelihood long after of disinhibited
behavior, antisocial tendencies, and
violence, a phenomenon that has been
called acquired sociopathy.
Remarkably, such individuals can tell you
that, say, murder is wrong.
They know, but they just can't regulate
their impulses.
Roughly half the people incarcerated for
violent antisocial criminality have a
history of TBI, versus about 8% of the
general population.
Having had a TBI increases the
likelihood of recidivism in prison
populations.
Moreover, neuroimaging studies reveal
elevated rates of structural and functional
abnormalities in the PFC among prisoners
with a history of violent, antisocial
criminality.
Then there's the effect of decades of
experiencing racial discrimination, which
is a predictor of poor health in every
corner of the body.
African Americans with more severe
histories of suffering discrimination,
based on the score from a questionnaire
after controlling for PTSD and trauma
history, have greater resting levels of
activity in the amygdala and greater
coupling between the amygdala and the
downstream brain regions that it activates.
If the subjects in that miserable social
exclusion paradigm, where the other two
players stop throwing the virtual ball to
you are African American, the more the
ostracizing is attributed to racism, the
more VMPFC activation there is.
In another neuroimaging study, performance on
a frontal task declined in subjects primed
with pictures of spiders versus birds.
Among African American subjects, the more of a
history of discrimination, the more spiders
activated the VMPFC and the more performance
declined.
What are the effects of a history of
prolonged discrimination?
A brain that is in a resting state of
don't-let-your-guard-down vigilance, that is
more reactive to perceived threat, and a
PFC burdened by a torrent of reporting from
the VMPFC about this constant state of
dis-ease.
To summarize this section, when you try to
do the harder thing that's better, the
PFC you're working with is going to be
displaying the consequences of whatever the
previous years have handed you.
The Legacy of the Time of Pimples
Take the previous paragraph, replace the
previous years with adolescence, underline the
entire section, and you're all set.
Chapter 3 provided the basic facts.
A. When you're an adolescent, your
PFC still has a ton of construction ahead of
it.
B. In contrast, the dopamine system, crucial
to reward, anticipation, and motivation, is
already going full blast, so the PFC hasn't
a prayer of effectively reining in thrill-seeking,
impulsivity, craving of novelty, meaning that
adolescents behave in adolescent ways.
C. If the adolescent PFC is still a
construction site, this time of your life is
the last period that environment and
experience will have a major role in
influencing your adult PFC.
Delayed frontocortical maturation has to
have evolved precisely so that adolescence has
this influence. How else are we going to
master discrepancies between the letter and
the spirit of laws of sociality?
Thus, adolescent social experience, for
example, will alter how the PFC regulates
social behavior in adults. How?
Round up all the usual suspects, lots of
glucocorticoids, lots of stress, physical,
psychological, social, during adolescence, and
your PFC won't be its best self in
adulthood. There will be fewer synapses and
less complex dendritic branching in the
MPFC and orbitofrontal cortex, along with
permanent changes in how PFC neurons respond to
the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate, due to
persistent changes in the structure of one of the
main glutamate receptors.
The adult PFC will be less effective in inhibiting
the amygdala, making it harder to unlearn
conditioned fear and less effective at inhibiting
the autonomic nervous system from overreacting to
being startled. Impaired impulse control, impaired
PFC-dependent cognitive tasks. The usual.
Conversely, an enriched, stimulating environment during
adolescence has great effects on the resulting adult
PFC and can reverse some of the effects of childhood
adversity. For example, an enriched environment during
adolescence causes permanent changes in gene regulation
in the PFC, producing higher adult levels of neuronal growth
factors like BDNF. Furthermore, while prenatal stress
causes reductions in BDNF levels in the adult PFC, stay
tuned, adolescent enrichment can reverse this effect. All
changes that impair the PFC's ability for impulse control
and gratification postponement. So, if you want to be better
at doing the harder thing as an adult, make sure you pick the
right adolescence.
Further back.
Now, go back to the paragraph you underlined, discussing
whatever adolescence has handed you, replace adolescence with childhood
and underline the paragraph 18 more times. What do you know? The
sort of childhood you had shapes the construction of the PFC at the time
and the sort of PFC you'll have in adulthood.
For example, no surprise, childhood abuse produces kids with a smaller PFC, with
less gray matter and with changes in circuitry, less communication among
different subregions of the PFC, less coupling between the VM PFC and the
amygdala, and the bigger the effect, the more prone the child is to anxiety.
Synapses in the brain are less excitable. There are changes in the numbers of
receptors for various neurotransmitters, and changes in gene expression and
patterns of epigenetic marking of genes, along with impaired executive function
and impulse control in the child. Many of these effects occur in the first half
decade or so of life. One might raise a cart and horse issue. The assumption in this
section is that abuse causes these changes in the brain. What about the
possibility that kids who already have these differences behave in ways that
make them more likely to be abused? This is highly unlikely. The abuse
typically precedes the behavioral changes. Unsurprising as well is that these
changes in the PFC in childhood can persist into adulthood. Childhood abuse
produces an adult PFC that is smaller, thinner, and with less gray matter, altered
PFC activity in response to emotional stimuli, altered levels of receptors for
various neurotransmitters, weakened coupling between both the PFC and
dopaminergic reward regions, predicting increased depression risk, and weakened
coupling with the amygdala as well, predicting more of a tendency to respond to
frustration with anger, trait anger. And once again, all of these changes are
associated with an adult PFC that isn't at its best. Thus, childhood abuse produces a
different adult PFC. And, grimly, having been abused as a child, produces an adult with
an increased likelihood of abusing their own child. At one month of age, PFC circuitry is
already different in children whose mothers were abused in childhood. These findings concern two
groups of people—abused in childhood or not. What about looking at the full spectrum of luck?
How about the effects of childhood socioeconomic status on our realm of supposed grit? No surprise,
the socioeconomic status of a child's family predicts the size, volume, and gray matter content of the PFC in
kindergartners. Same thing in toddlers. In six-month-olds. In four-week-olds. You want to scream at how unfair
life can be. All the individual pieces of these findings flow from that.
Socioeconomic status predicts how much a young child's DLPFC activates and recruits other brain regions
during an executive task. It predicts more responsiveness of the amygdala to physical or
social threat, a stronger activation signal carrying this emotional response to the PFC via the VMPFC.
And such status predicts every possible measure of frontal executive function in kids. Naturally,
lower socioeconomic status predicts worse PFC development.
There are hints as to the mediators. By age six, low status is already predicting elevated
glucocorticoid levels. The higher the levels, the less activity in the PFC on average.
Moreover, glucocorticoid levels in kids are influenced not only by the socioeconomic status
of the family, but by that of the neighborhood as well. Increased amounts of stress mediate the
relationship between low status and less PFC activation in kids. As a related theme,
lower socioeconomic status predicts a less stimulating environment for a child.
All those enriching extracurricular activities that can't be afforded. The world of single
mothers working multiple jobs who are too exhausted to read to their child. As one shocking manifestation
of this, by age three, your average high socioeconomic status kid has heard about 30 million more words
at home than a poor kid. And in one study, the relationship between socioeconomic status and the
activity of a child's PFC was partially mediated by the complexity of language use at home.
Awful. Given the start of constructing the frontal cortex during this period, it wouldn't be crazy to
predict that childhood socioeconomic status predicts things in adults. Childhood status,
independent of the status achieved in adulthood, is a significant predictor of glucocorticoid levels,
the size of the orbitofrontal cortex, and performance of PFC-dependent tasks in adulthood,
not to mention incarceration rates. Miseries like childhood poverty and childhood abuse are
incorporated in someone's adverse childhood experiences ACE score. As we saw in the last
chapter, it queries whether someone experienced or witnessed physical, emotional, or sexual childhood
abuse, physical or emotional neglect, or household dysfunction, including divorce, spousal abuse,
or a family member mentally ill, incarcerated, or struggling with substance abuse. With each
increase in someone's ACE score, there's an increased likelihood of a hyperreactive amygdala
that has expanded in size and a sluggish PFC that never fully developed.
Let's push the bad news one step further, into chapter 3's realm of prenatal environmental effects.
Low socioeconomic status for a pregnant woman, or her living in a high-crime neighborhood,
both predict less cortical development at the time of the baby's birth, even back when the child was
still in utero. An ACE score, a fetal adversity score, last chapter's ridiculously lucky,
childhood experience score, they all tell the same thing. It takes a certain kind of audacity and
indifference to look at findings like these and still insist that how readily someone does the
harder things in life justifies blame, punishment, praise, or reward.
Just ask those fetuses in the womb of a low socioeconomic status woman, already paying a neurobiological price.
The legacy of the genes you were handed, and their evolution.
Genes have something to do with the sort of PFC you have.
Big shocker. As described in the last chapter, the growth factors, enzymes that generate or break down
neurotransmitters, receptors for neurotransmitters and hormones, etc., etc., are all made of protein,
meaning that they are coded for by genes. The notion that genes have something to do with
all this can be totally superficial and uninteresting. Differences between the type of genes possessed by
a particular species help explain why a frontal cortex occurs in humans but not in barnacles in the
sea or heather on the hill. The types of genes possessed by humans help explain why the frontal cortex,
like the rest of the cortex, consists of six layers of neurons and isn't bigger than your skull.
However, the sort of genetics that interests us when genes come into the picture, concerns the fact
that that particular gene can come in different flavors, with these variants differing from one
person to the next. Thus, in this section, we're not interested in genes that help form a frontal
cortex in humans but don't exist in fungi. We're interested in the variation in versions of genes that helps
explain variation in the volume of the frontal cortex, its level of activity, as detected with EEG,
and performance on PFC-dependent tasks. In other words, we're interested in the variants of those
genes that help explain why two people differ in their likelihood of stealing a cookie. Nicely,
the field has progressed to the point of understanding how variants of specific genes relate to frontal
function. A bunch of them relate to the neurotransmitter serotonin. For example, there's a gene that codes for
a protein that removes serotonin from the synapse, and which version of that gene you have influences the
tightness of coupling between the PFC and amygdala. Variation in a gene related to the breakdown of serotonin in
the synapse helps predict people's performance on PFC-dependent reversal tasks. Variation in the gene
for one of the serotonin receptors helps predict how good people are at impulse control.
Those are just about the genetics of serotonin signaling. In a study of the genomes of 13,000 people,
a complex cluster of gene variants predicted an increased likelihood of impulsive, risky behavior.
The more of those variants someone had, the smaller their DLPFC. A crucial point about
genes related to brain function, well, pretty much all genes, is that the same gene variant will work
differently, sometimes even dramatically differently, in different environments.
This interaction between gene variant and variation in environment means that, ultimately, you can't
say what a gene does, only what it does in each particular environment in which it has been studied.
And as a great example of this, invariance in the gene for one type of serotonin receptor
helps explain impulsivity in women, but only if they have an eating disorder.
The section on adolescence considered why dramatic delayed maturation of the PFC evolved in humans,
and how that makes that region's constructions so subject to environmental influences.
How do genes code for freedom from genes? In at least two ways. The first, straightforward way,
involves the genes that influence how rapidly PFC maturation occurs.
The second way is subtler and elegant. Genes relevant to how sensitive the PFC will be to different
environments. Consider an imaginary gene, coming in two variants, that influences how prone someone is to
stealing. A person on their own has the same low likelihood, regardless of variant. However, if there's a
peer group egging the person on, one variant results in a 5% increase in likelihood of succumbing. The
other? 50%. In other words, the two variants produce dramatic differences in sensitivity to peer pressure.
Let's frame this sort of difference more mechanically. Suppose you have an electrical cord that plugs into a
socket. When it's plugged in, you don't steal. The socket is made of an imaginary protein that comes in two
variants, which determine how wide the slots are that the plug plugs into. In a silent,
hermetically sealed room, a plug remains in the socket, regardless of variant. But if a group of
taunting peer-pressuring elephants thunders past, the plug is 10 times more likely to vibrate out of the
loose slot socket than the tight one. And that turns out to be something like a genetic basis for being
freer from genes. Work by Benjamin de Beauvoir at Harvard concerns a gene coding for a protein called
tenurin A, which is involved in synapse formation between neurons. The gene comes in two variants
that influence how tightly a cable from one neuron plugs into a tenurin A socket on the other. To
simplify enormously. Have the loose socket variant, and the result will be more variability in synaptic
connectiveness. Or, stated our way, the loose socket variant codes for neurons that are more sensitive to
environmental influences during synapse formation. It's not known yet if tenurins work this way in
our brains. These were studies of flies. Yes, environmental influences even affect synapse formation
in flies. But things conceptually similar to this have to be occurring in umpteen dimensions in our brains.
As we saw in the previous chapter's overview, different sorts of ecosystems generate different
sorts of cultures, which affect a child's upbringing from virtually the moment of birth, tilting the brain
construction toward ways that make it easier for them to fit into the culture, and thus pass its values
on to the next generation. Of course, cultural differences majorly influence the PFC.
Essentially, all the studies done concern comparisons between Southeast Asian collectivist cultures valuing
harmony, interdependence, and conformity, and North American individualist ones emphasizing autonomy,
individual rights, and personal achievement. And their findings make sense.
Here's one you couldn't make up. In Westerners, the VMPFC activates in response to seeing a picture of your
your own face, but not your mother's. In East Asians, the VMPFC activates equally for both.
These differences become even more extreme if you prime subjects beforehand to think about their cultural
values. Study bicultural individuals, that is, with one collectivist culture parent, one individualist,
primed them to think about one culture or the other, and they then showed that culture's typical profile
of VMPFC activation. Other studies show differences in PFC and emotion regulation.
A meta-analysis of 35 studies' neuroimaging subjects during social processing tasks showed that East Asians
average higher activity in the DLPFC than Westerners, along with activation of a brain region called
the temporoparietal junction, which is central to theory of mind. This is basically a brain more
actively working on emotion regulation and understanding other people's perspectives.
In contrast, Westerners present a picture of more emotional intensity, self-reference,
capacity for strongly emotional disgust or empathy, higher levels of activity in the VMPFC,
insula, and anterior cingulate. And these neuroimaging differences are greatest in subjects
who most strongly espouse their cultural values. There are also PFC differences in cognitive style.
In general, collectivist culture individuals prefer and excel at context-dependent cognitive tasks,
while it's context-independent tasks for individualistic culture folks. And in both
populations, the PFC must work harder when subjects struggle with the type of task less favored by their
culture. Where do these differences come from on a big-picture level?
As discussed in the last chapter, East Asian collectivism is generally thought to arise from
the communal work demands of floodplain rice farming. Recent Chinese immigrants to the United
States already showed the Western distinction between activating your VMPFC when thinking about
yourself and activating it when thinking about your mother. This suggests that people back home who were
more individualistic were the ones more likely to choose to emigrate, a mechanism of self-selection for
these traits. Where do these differences come from on a smaller picture level? As covered in the last
chapter, children are raised differently in collectivist versus individualist cultures, with
implications for how the brain is constructed. But in addition, there are probably genetic influences.
People who are spectacularly successful at expressing their culture's values tend to leave copies of
their genes. In contrast, fail to show up with the rest of the village during rice harvesting day because you
decided to go snowboarding? Or disrupt the Super Bowl by trying to persuade the teams to cooperate rather than
compete? Well, such cultural malcontents, contrarians and weirdos are less likely to pass on their genes.
And if these traits are influenced at all by genes, which they are, as seen in the previous section,
this can produce cultural differences in gene frequencies. Collectivist and individualist cultures
differ in the incidence of gene variants related to dopamine and norepinephrine processing,
variants of the gene coding for the pump that removes serotonin from the synapse,
and variants of the gene coding for the receptor in the brain for oxytocin.
In other words, there's co-evolution of gene frequencies, cultural values, child development
practices, reinforcing each other over the generations, shaping what your PFC is going to be like.
The death of the myth of freely chosen grit
We're pretty good at recognizing that we have no control over the attributes that life has gifted
or cursed us with. But what we do with those attributes, at right-wrong crossroads,
powerfully, toxically, invites us to conclude, with the strongest of intuitions, that we are seeing free
will in action. But the reality is that whether you display admirable gumption, squander opportunity in
a murk of self-indulgence, majestically stare down temptation or belly flop into it,
these are all the outcome of the functioning of the PFC and the brain regions it connects to.
And that PFC functioning is the outcome of the second before, minutes before, millennia before.
The same punchline as in the previous chapter concerning the entire brain.
And invoking the same critical word. Seamless.
As we've seen, talk about the evolution of the PFC, and you're also talking about the genes that evolved,
the proteins they code for in the brain, and how childhood altered the regulation of those genes and proteins.
A seamless arc of influences bringing your PFC to this moment, without a crevice for free will to lodge in.
Here's my favorite finding pertinent to this chapter. There's a task that can be done in two different ways.
In version 1, do some amount of work and you get some amount of reward. But if you do twice as much work,
you get three times as much of a reward.
Which version should you do?
If you think you can freely choose to exercise self-discipline, choose version 2.
You're going to choose to do a little bit more work and get a huge boost in reward as a result.
People usually prefer version 2, independent of the sizes of the rewards.
A recent study shows that activity in the VMPFC tracks the degree of preference for version 2.
What does that mean?
In this setting, the VMPFC is coding for how much we prefer circumstances that reward self-discipline.
Thus, this is the part of the brain that codes for how wisely we think we'll be exercising free will.
In other words, this is the nuts and bolts biological machinery coding for a belief that there are no nuts or bolts.
Sam Harris argues convincingly that it's impossible to successfully think of what you're going to think next.
The takeaway from chapters 2 and 3 is that it's impossible to successfully wish what you're going to wish for.
This chapter's punchline is that it's impossible to successfully will yourself to have more willpower.
And that it isn't a great idea to run the world on the belief that people can and should.
5. A Primer on Chaos
Suppose that just before you started listening to this sentence,
You reached to scratch an itch on your shoulder, noted that it's becoming harder to reach that spot,
thought of your joints calcifying with age, which made you vow to exercise more, and then you got a snack.
Well, science has officially weighed in. Each of those actions or thoughts, conscious or otherwise, and every bit of neurobiology underpinning it, was determined.
Nothing just got it into its head to be a causeless cause.
No matter how thinly you slice it, each unique biological state was caused by a unique state that preceded it.
And if you want to truly understand things, you need to break these two states down to their component parts,
and figure out how each component comprising just before now gave rise to each piece of now.
This is how the universe works.
But what if that isn't? What if some moments aren't caused by anything preceding them?
What if some unique nows can be caused by multiple unique just before nows?
What if the strategy of learning how something works by breaking it down to its component parts is often useless?
As it turns out, all of these are the case.
Throughout the past century, the previous paragraph's picture of the universe was overturned,
giving birth to the sciences of chaos theory, emergent complexity, and quantum indeterminacy.
To label these as revolutions is not hyperbolic.
When I was a kid, I read a novel called The 21 Balloons,
about a utopian society on the island of Krakatoa built on balloon technology,
destined to be destroyed by the famed 1883 eruption of the volcano there.
It was fantastic, and the second I got to the end, I immediately flipped to the front to re-read it.
And it was then almost a quarter century before I immediately flipped to the front to re-read a different book.
An Introduction to One of These Scientific Revolutions
Staggeringly interesting stuff.
This chapter, and the five after it, reviews these three revolutions,
and how numerous thinkers believe that you can find free will in their crevices.
I will admit that the previous three chapters have an emotional intensity for me.
I am put into a detached, professorial, egg-heady sort of rage
by the idea that you can assess someone's behavior outside the context
of what brought them to that moment of intent.
That their history doesn't matter.
Or that even if a behavior seems determined,
free will lurks wherever you're not looking.
And by the conclusion that righteous judgment of others is okay,
because while life is tough, and we're unfairly gifted or cursed with our attributes,
what we freely choose to do with them is the measure of our worth.
These stances have fueled profound amounts of undeserved pain and unearned entitlement.
The revolutions in the next five chapters don't have that same visceral edge.
As we'll see, there aren't a whole lot of thinkers out there citing, say,
subatomic quantum indeterminacy when smugly proclaiming that free will exists,
and they earn their life in the top 1%.
These topics don't make me want to set up barricades in Paris,
singing revolutionary anthems from Les Mis.
Instead, these topics excite me immensely because they reveal completely unexpected structure and pattern.
This enhances, rather than quenches, the sense that life is more interesting than can be imagined.
These are subjects that fundamentally upend how we think about how complex things work.
But nonetheless, they are not where free will dwells.
This, and the next chapter, focus on chaos theory,
the field that can make studying the component parts of complex things useless.
After a primer about the topic in this chapter,
the next will cover two ways people mistakenly believe they've found free will in chaotic systems.
First is the idea that if you start with something simple in biology,
and, unpredictably, out of that comes hugely complex behavior,
free will just happened.
Second is the belief that if you have a complex behavior
that could have arisen from either of two different preceding biological states,
and there's no way to ever tell which one caused it,
then you can get away with claiming that it wasn't caused by anything,
that the event was free of determinism.
Back when things made sense.
Suppose that x equals y plus 1.
If that is the case, then x plus 1 equals...
And you were readily able to calculate that the answer is
y plus 1 plus 1.
Do x plus 3, and you've instantly got y plus 1 plus 3.
And, here's the crucial point.
After solving x plus 1,
you were able to then solve x plus 3
without first having to figure out
x plus 2.
You were able to extrapolate into the future
without examining each intervening step.
Same thing for x plus
a gazillion,
or x plus
sorta a gazillion,
or x plus
a star-nosed mole.
A world like this
has a number of properties.
As we just saw,
knowing the starting state of a system,
for example,
x equals y plus 1,
lets you accurately predict
what x plus
whatever will equal,
without the intervening steps.
This property runs in both directions.
If you're given
y plus 1 plus
whatever,
you know then that your starting point was
x plus whatever.
Implicit in that,
there is a unique pathway
connecting the starting and ending states.
It is also inevitable
that x plus 1
cannot equal y plus 1 plus 1
only some of the time.
As shown dealing with something like
sorta a gazillion,
the magnitude of uncertainty
and approximation
in the starting state
is directly proportional
to the magnitude
at the other end.
You can know
what you don't know,
can predict
the degree of unpredictability.
This relationship
between starting states
and mature states
helped give rise
to what has been
the central concept
of science
for centuries.
This is
reductionism.
The idea that
to understand
something complicated,
break it down
into its component parts,
study them,
add your insights
about each component part
together
and you will understand
the complicated whole.
And if one of those
component parts
is itself too complicated
to understand,
study its
eency subcomponent parts
and understand them.
Reductionism like this
is vital.
If your watch,
running on the ancient
technology of gears,
stops working,
you apply a reductive approach
to solving the problem.
You take the watch apart,
identify the one
tiny gear
that has a broken tooth,
replace it,
and put the pieces
back together
and the watch runs.
This approach
is also how you do
detective work.
You arrive at a crime scene
and interview the witnesses.
The first witness
observed only parts
one,
two,
and three of the event.
The second
saw only two,
three,
and four.
The third
only three,
four,
and five.
Bummer.
No one saw
everything that happened.
But thanks to
a reductive mindset,
you can solve the problem
by taking the
fragmentary component parts,
each of the three witnesses
overlapping observations,
and combine them
to understand
the complete sequence.
Or,
as another example,
in the first season
of the pandemic,
the world waited
for answers
to reductive questions
like,
what receptor
on the surface
of a lung cell
binds the spike protein
of SARS-CoV-2,
allowing it to enter
and sicken that cell.
Mind you,
a reductive approach
doesn't apply
to everything.
If there's a drought,
the sky dotted
with puffy clouds
that haven't rained
in a year,
you don't first
isolate a cloud,
study its left half
and then its right half,
and then half of each half,
and so on,
until you find
the itty-bitty gear
in the center
that has a broken tooth.
Nonetheless,
a reductive approach
has long been
the gold standard
for scientifically
exploring a complex topic.
And then,
starting in the early 1960s,
a scientific revolution
emerged
that came to be called
chaoticism,
or chaos theory.
And its central idea
is that really interesting,
complicated things
are often not best understood,
cannot be understood,
on a reductive level.
To understand,
say,
a human whose behavior
is abnormal,
approach the problem
as if this were a cloud
that does not rain,
rather than as a watch
that does not tick.
And,
naturally,
humans as clouds
generate all sorts
of nearly irresistible urges
for concluding
that you are observing
free will in action.
Chaotic Unpredictability
Chaos theory
has its creation story.
When I was a kid
in the 1960s,
inaccurate weather prediction
was mocked
with trenchant witticisms
like,
the weatherman
on the radio,
invariably indeed a man,
said,
it's going to be sunny today,
so better bring an umbrella.
MIT meteorologist
Edward Lawrence
began using
some antediluvian computer
to model weather patterns
in an attempt
to increase
prediction accuracy,
stick variables
like temperature
and humidity
into the model
and see how accurate
the predictions became.
See if additional variables,
other variables,
different weightings
of variables,
improved predictability.
So,
Lawrence was studying
a model on his computer
using 12 variables.
Time for lunch.
Halt the program
in the middle of its
cranking out
a time course
of predictions.
Come back post-lunch,
and,
to save time,
restart the program
at a point
before you stopped it,
rather than starting
all over.
Punch in the values
of those 12 variables
at that time point,
and let the model
resume its predicting.
That's what
Lawrence did,
which is when
our understanding
of the universe
changed.
One variable
at that time point
had a value
of 0.506127,
except that on the printout,
the computer
had rounded it down
to 0.506.
Maybe the computer
hadn't wanted
to overwhelm
this human 1.0.
In any case,
0.506127
became 0.506,
and Lawrence,
not knowing about
this slight inaccuracy,
ran the program
with the variable
at 0.506,
thinking that it was
actually 0.506127.
Thus,
it was now
dealing with a value
that was a smidgen
different from the real one,
and we know
just what should
have happened now
in our supposedly
purely linear,
reductive world.
The degree to which
the starting state
was off from what
he thought it was,
that is,
0.506,
rather than 0.506127,
predicted how inaccurate
his ending state
would be.
The program
would generate
a point that was
only a smidgen
different from that
same point
before lunch.
If you superimpose
the before and after
lunch tracings,
you'd barely see
a difference.
Lorenz let the program,
still depending on
0.506 instead of
0.506127,
continue to run.
And out came a result
that was even more
discrepant than he had
expected from the
pre-lunch run.
Weird.
And with each
successive point,
things got weirder.
Sometimes things
seemed to have
returned to the
pre-lunch pattern,
but would then
diverge again,
with the divergences
increasingly different,
unpredictably,
crazily so.
And,
eventually,
rather than the
program generating
something even
remotely close to
what he saw the
first time,
the discrepancy in
the two tracings
was about as
different as was
possible.
This is what
Lorenz saw.
The pre- and
post-lunch tracings
superimposed.
A printout now,
with the status of
a holy relic in
the field.
See figure 5.1
in the accompanying
PDF.
Lorenz finally spotted
that slight rounding
error introduced
after lunch and
realized that this
made the system
unpredictable,
non-linear,
and non-additive.
By 1963,
Lorenz announced
this discovery in a
dense technical
paper,
Deterministic
Non-Periodic
Flow,
in the highly
specialized,
Journal of
Atmospheric
Sciences,
and in the
paper,
Lorenz,
while beginning to
appreciate how
these insights were
overturning centuries
of reductive
thinking,
still didn't forget
where he came
from.
Will it ever be
possible to
perfectly predict
all of future
weather?
Readers of the
journal plaintively
asked.
Nope,
Lorenz concluded.
The chance of
this is
non-existent,
and the paper
has since been
cited in other
papers,
a staggering
26,000-plus
times.
If Lorenz's
original program
had contained
only two
weather variables
instead of
the 12 he
was using,
the familiar
reductiveness
would have
held.
After a
slightly wrong
number was
fed into
the computer,
the output
would have
been precisely
as wrong
at every
step for
the rest
of time.
Predictably
so.
Imagine a
universe that
consists of
just two
variables,
the Earth
and the
Moon,
exerting
their
gravitational
forces on
each other.
In this
linear
additive world,
it is
possible to
infer precisely
where they
were at
any point
in the
past and
predict
precisely
where each
will be
at any
point in
the future.
If an
approximation
was accidentally
introduced,
the same
magnitude of
approximation
would continue
forever.
But now
add the
Sun into
the mix
and the
non-linearity
happens.
This is
because the
Earth
influences
the Moon,
which means
that the
Earth influences
how the
Moon influences
the Sun,
which means
that the
Earth influences
how the
Moon influences
the Sun's
influence on
the Earth.
And don't
forget the
other direction,
Earth to
Sun to
Moon.
The
interactions
among the
three variables
make linear
predictability
impossible.
Once you've
entered the
realm of
what is
known as
the
three-body
problem,
with three
or more
variables
interacting,
things have
inevitably
become
unpredictable.
When you
have a
non-linear
system,
tiny
differences
in a
starting
state
from one
time to
the next
can cause
them to
diverge from
each other
enormously,
even
exponentially,
something since
termed
sensitive
dependence
on
initial
conditions.
Lorenz
noted that
the
unpredictability,
rather than
hurtling off
forever into
the exponential
stratosphere,
is sometimes
bounded,
constrained,
and
dissipative.
In other
words,
the degree of
unpredictability
oscillates
erratically
around the
predicted value,
repeatedly a
little more,
a little less
than predicted
in the series
of numbers
you are
generating,
the degree
of discrepancy
always different,
forever after.
It's like
each data point
you are getting
is sort of
attracted to
what the
data point
is predicted
to be,
but not
enough to
actually reach
the predicted
value.
Strange.
And thus,
Lorenz named
these strange
attractors.
So,
a tiny
difference in
a starting
state can
magnify
unpredictably
over time.
Lorenz took
to summarizing
this idea
with a
metaphor
about
seagulls.
A friend
suggested
something more
picturesque,
and by
1972,
this was
formalized
into the
title of
a talk
given by
Lorenz.
Predictability.
Does the
flap of a
butterfly's
wings in
Brazil
set off
a tornado
in Texas?
Thus was
born the
symbol of
the chaos
theory
revolution,
the
butterfly
effect.
Chaoticism
you can do
at home.
Time to see
what chaoticism
and sensitive
dependence on
initial conditions
look like in
practice.
This makes use
of a model
system that
is so cool
and fun
that I've
even fleetingly
wished that I
could do
computer coding
as it would
make it
easier to
play with
it.
Start off
with a
grid,
like the
one on
a piece
of graph
paper,
where the
first row
is your
starting
condition.
Specifically,
each of the
boxes in
the row
can be in
one of
two states,
either open
or filled,
or in
binary coding,
either 0 or
1.
There are
16,384
possible patterns
for that
row.
See figure
5.1
through 5.4
in your
accompanying
PDF file.
Time now to
generate the
second row of
boxes that are
open or filled,
that new
pattern determined
by the pattern
in row 1.
We need a
rule for how
to do this.
Here's the
most boring
possible example.
In row 2,
a box that is
underneath the
filled box
gets filled.
A box
underneath an
open box
remains open.
Applying that
rule over and
over, using
row 2 as the
basis for row
3, 3 for
4, and so
on, is just
going to produce
some boring
columns.
Or, impose the
opposite rule,
such that if a
box is filled,
the one below it
in the next row
becomes open,
while an open
box spawns a
filled one,
and the outcome
isn't all that
exciting, producing
sort of a
lopsided checkered
pattern.
As the main
point, starting
with either of
these rules, if
you know the
starting state, that
is, the pattern
in row 1, you
can accurately
predict what a
row anywhere in
the future will
look like.
Our linear
universe again.
Let's go back
to our row 1.
Now, whether a
particular row 2
box will be open
or filled is
determined by the
state of three
boxes.
Here's a
random rule for
how the state of
a trio of
adjacent row 1
boxes determines
what happens in
the row 2 box
below.
A row 2 box is
filled if and
only if one of
the trio of boxes
above it is
filled in.
Otherwise, the
row 2 box will
remain open.
See figures 5.4
through 5.17.
Figures representing
changes in the
patterns of boxes
can be found in
the accompanying
PDF file.
Let's describe what
we've learned so
far in a
metaphorical way,
rather than using
terms like input,
output, and
algorithm.
With some starting
states, and the
reproduction rule
used to produce
each subsequent
generation, things
can evolve into
wildly interesting
mature states.
But you can also
get some that go
extinct, like that
last example.
Why the
biology metaphors?
Because this
world of generating
patterns like this
applies to nature.
We have just been
exploring an example
of a cellular
automaton in the
PDF that comes
with this
audiobook, where
you start with a
row of cells that
are either open or
filled, supply a
reproduction rule, and
let the process
iterate.
The rule we've
been following, if
and only if one
box of the trio
above is filled, is
called rule 22 in
the cellular automata
universe, which
consists of 256
rules.
Not all of these
rules generate
something interesting.
Depending on the
starting state, some
produce a pattern that
just repeats for
infinity in an inert,
lifeless sort of
way, or that goes
extinct by the
second row.
Very few generate
complex, dynamic
patterns.
And of the few
that do, rule 22 is
one of the favorites.
People have spent
their careers studying
its chaoticism.
What is chaotic
about rule 22?
We've now seen that
depending on the
starting state, by
applying rule 22, you
can get one of three
mature patterns.
A. Nothing because
it went extinct.
B. A crystallized,
boring, inorganic,
periodic pattern.
C. A pattern that
grows and rides and
changes, with pockets
of structure giving
way to anything but
a dynamic, organic
profile.
And as the crucial
point, there is no
way to take any
irregular starting
state and predict
what row 100, or
row 1000, or row
any big number will
look like.
You have to march
through every
intervening row,
simulating it to
find out.
It is impossible to
predict if the
mature form of a
particular starting
state will be
extinct, crystalline,
or dynamic, or, if
either of the latter
two, what the
pattern will be.
People with
spectacular mathematical
powers have tried
and failed.
And this limit,
paradoxically, extends
to showing that you
can't prove that some
wear a few baby steps
before reaching
infinity, that the
chaotic unpredictability
will suddenly calm
down into a
sensible, repeating
pattern.
We have a version of
the three-body
problem, with
interactions that are
neither linear nor
additive.
You cannot take a
reductive approach,
breaking things down
to its component
parts, the eight
different possible
trios of boxes and
their outcomes, and
predict what you're
going to get.
This is not a system
for generating
clocks.
It's for generating
clouds.
So we've just seen
that knowing the
irregular starting
state gives you no
predictive power about
the mature state.
You'll just have to
simulate each intervening
step to find out.
Now, consider Rule 22
applied to each of
these four starting
states.
Two of these four,
once taken out ten
generations, produce an
identical pattern for
the rest of time.
I dare you to stare at
these four and correctly
predict which two it is
going to be.
It cannot be done.
Get some graph paper and
crank through this, and
you'll see that two of
these four converge.
In other words, knowing
the mature state of a
system like this gives
you no predictive power
as to what the starting
state was, or if it
could have arisen from
multiple different
starting states, another
defining feature of the
chaoticism of this
system.
Let's state this
biologically.
A single mutation in
box 20 can have major
consequences.
Let's state this with the
formalism of chaos
theory.
This system shows
sensitive dependence on
the initial condition.
Let's state it in a way
that is ultimately most
meaningful.
A butterfly in box 20
either did or didn't
flap its wings.
I love this stuff.
One reason is because of
the ways in which you can
model biological systems
with this, an idea
explored at length by
Stephen Wolfram.
Cellular automata are
also inordinately cool
because you can increase
their dimensionality.
The version we've been
covering is one-dimensional
in that you start with a
line of boxes and
generate more lines.
Conway's Game of Life,
invented by the late
Princeton mathematician
John Conway, is a
two-dimensional version
where you start with a
grid of boxes and
generate each subsequent
generation's grid and
produce absolutely
astonishingly dynamic,
chaotic patterns that
are typically described
as involving individual
boxes that are living
or dying.
All with the usual
properties, you can't
predict the mature state
from the starting state,
you have to simulate
every intervening step.
You can't predict the
starting state from the
mature state because of
the possibility that
multiple starting states
converged into the
same mature one.
We're going to return
to this convergence
feature in a big way.
The system shows
sensitive dependence on
initial conditions.
There's an additional
realm classically discussed
when introducing
chaoticism.
I've sidestepped covering
it here, however,
because I've learned the
hard way from my
classrooms that it is
very difficult and or
I'm very bad at
explaining it.
If interested, read up
about Lorenz's water
wheel, period doubling,
and the significance of
period three for the
onset of chaos.
With this introduction
to chaoticism in hand,
we can now appreciate
the next chapter of the
field.
Unexpectedly, the
concepts of chaos
theory became really
popular, sowing the
seeds for a certain
style of free will
belief.
The age of chaos
The upheaval in the
early 1960s caused by
chaos theory, strange
attractors, and sensitive
dependence on initial
conditions was rapidly
felt throughout the world,
fundamentally altering
everything from the most
highfalutin philosophical
musings to the concerns
of everyday life.
Actually, not at all.
Lorenz's revolutionary
1963 paper was mostly
met with silence.
It took years for him to
begin to collect
acolytes, mostly a group
of physics grad students
at UC Santa Cruz, who
supposedly spent a lot of
time stoned and studied
things like the
chaoticism of how
faucets drip.
Mainstream theorists
mostly ignored the
implications.
Part of the neglect
reflected the fact that
chaos theory is a
horrible name, insofar
as it is about the
opposite of nihilistic
chaos, and is instead
about the patterns of
structure hidden in
seeming chaos.
The more fundamental
reason for chaoticism
getting off to a slow
start was that, if you
have a reductive mindset,
unsolvable, nonlinear
interactions among a
large number of
variables is a total pain
to study.
Thus, most researchers
tried to study
complicated things by
limiting the number of
variables considered so
that things remain tame
and tractable.
And this guaranteed the
incorrect conclusion that
the world is mostly about
linear, additive
predictability, and
nonlinear chaoticism was
a weird anomaly that
could mostly be ignored.
Until it couldn't be
anymore, as it became
clear that chaoticism
lurked behind the most
interesting, complicated
things, a cell, a brain, a
person, a society, was
more like the chaoticism of
a cloud than the
reductionism of a watch.
By the 80s, chaos theory
had exploded as an
academic subject.
This was around the time
that the pioneering
generation of renegade
stoner physicists began to
be things like a professor
at Oxford or the founder of a
company using chaos theory to
plunder the stock market.
Suddenly, there were
specialized journals,
conferences, departments,
and interdisciplinary
institutes.
Scholarly papers and books
appeared about the
implications of chaoticism
for education, corporate
management, economics, the
stock market, art and
architecture, with the
interesting idea that we
find nature to be more
beautiful than, say,
modernist office buildings
because the former has just
the right amount of chaos.
Literary criticism, cultural
studies of television, with
the observation that, like
chaotic systems, television
dramas are both complex and
simple at the same time.
Neurology and cardiology, in
both of which, interestingly,
too little chaoticism was
appearing to be a bad thing.
There were even scholarly
articles about the relevance of
chaos theory to theology,
including one with the
wonderful title,
Chaos at the Marriage of
Heaven and Hell, in which
the author wrote,
Those of us who seek to
engage modern culture in our
theological reflection
cannot afford to overlook
chaos theory.
Meanwhile, interest in chaos
theory, accurate or otherwise,
burst into the general public's
consciousness as well.
Who could have predicted that?
There were the ubiquitous wall
calendars of fractals, novels,
books of poetry, multiple movies,
TV episodes, numerous bands,
albums, and songs, commandeered
strange attractor or the
butterfly effect in their titles.
According to a Simpsons fandom
site, in one episode during her
baseball coaching period,
Lisa is seen reading a book called
Chaos Theory in Baseball Analysis.
And as my favorite in the novel
Chaos Theory, part of the
Nerds of Paradise Harlequin
romance series, our protagonist
has her eyes on handsome
engineer Will Darling.
Despite his unbuttoned shirt,
six-pack, and insouciant
bedroom eyes, it is understood
that Will must still be a nerd
since he wears glasses.
The growing interest in chaos
theory generated the sound of
a zillion butterfly wings
flapping.
Given that, it was inevitable
that various thinkers began to
proclaim that the unpredictable
chaotic cloudness of human
behavior is where free will
runs free.
Hopefully, the material already
covered, showing what chaoticism
is and isn't, will help show how
this cannot be.
The giddy conclusion that
chaoticism proves free will
takes at least two forms.
Wrong Conclusion No. 1
The Freely Choosing Cloud
For free will believers, the crux
of the issue is lack of
predictability.
At innumerable junctures in our
lives, including highly
consequential ones, we choose
between X and not X, and even a
vastly knowledgeable observer could
not have predicted every such choice.
In this vein, physicist
Gert Eilenberger writes,
It is simply improbable that
reality is completely and
exhaustively mappable by
mathematical constructs.
This is because the mathematical
abilities of the species
Homo sapiens are in principle
limited because of their
biological basis.
Because of chaoticism, the
determinism of Laplace cannot be
absolute, and the question of the
possibility of chance and freedom
is open again.
The exclamation mark at the end
is Eilenberger's.
A physicist means business if he's
putting exclamation marks in his
writing.
Biophysicist Kelly Clancy makes a
similar point concerning chaoticism
in the brain.
Over time, chaotic trajectories will
gravitate toward strange attractors.
Because chaos can be controlled, it
strikes a fine balance between
reliability and exploration.
Yet because it's unpredictable, it's
a strong candidate for the
dynamical substrate of free will.
Doyne Farmer weighs in as well, in a
way I found disappointing, given that
he was one of the faucet drip
apostles.
