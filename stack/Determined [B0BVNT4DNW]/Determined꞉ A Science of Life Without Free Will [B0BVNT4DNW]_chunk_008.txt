A Liberatory Science
Without Tongue-in-Cheek
A Case Study
In the process of working on this book,
I spoke to a number of people
who were involved in advocacy
for people suffering from obesity.
One told me about when she first learned
about the hormone leptin.
As background,
leptin is the poster child of the
it's a biological disease,
not a measure of your lack
of self-discipline, insight.
Regulating fat storage throughout the body
and, most significant,
telling your hypothalamus
when you've eaten enough.
Abnormally low levels of leptin signaling
produce an abnormally low capacity
for feeling satiated,
resulting in severe obesity
beginning in childhood.
This individual turned out
to carry a leptin mutation.
Inspection of a family picture album
suggested that it had been there
for generations.
Mutation puts us in the world
of medical exotica.
Regular old, unmutated leptin
and its receptor genes
come in various flavors,
differing in the efficiency
with which they function.
Same for the literally hundreds
of other genes
implicated in regulating
body mass index,
BMI.
Of course,
environment also plays a major role.
Just to home in on one
of our familiar outposts,
the womb,
your lifelong propensity
toward obesity
is influenced by whether
you were undernourished
as a fetus,
whether your pregnant mother
smoked,
drank,
or took illicit drugs,
even by the gut bacteria
she transferred
to your fetal gut.
Some of the precise genes
that would have been
epigenetically modified
in your fetal pancreas
and fat cells
have even been identified.
And as usual,
different versions of genes
interact differently
with different environments.
One gene variant
increases obesity risk,
but only when coupled
with your mother
having smoked
during pregnancy.
The impact of a variant
of another gene
is stronger in urban dwellers
than in rural.
Some variants increase
the risk of obesity
depending on your gender,
race,
or ethnicity,
depending on whether
you exercise.
In other words,
a genetics of why exercise
melts away fat
in some people,
but not others,
depending on the specifics
of your diet,
whether you drink,
and so on.
On a larger scale,
be of low socioeconomic status
or live in a place
where you're surrounded
by inequality,
on the levels of countries,
states, and cities,
and the same diet
is more likely
to make you obese.
Collectively,
these genes
and gene-environment
interactions
regulate every
nook and cranny
of biology,
are relevant
to everything
from the avidity
with which a newborn
nurses
to why two adults
with the same
elevated BMI
have different risks
of adult-onset diabetes.
Let's look again
at that table
from Chapter 4.
Biological stuff.
Do you have grit?
Having destructive
sexual urges?
Do you resist
acting upon them?
Being a natural marathoner?
Do you fight
through the pain?
Not being all that bright.
Do you triumph
by studying extra hard?
Having a proclivity
toward alcoholism?
Do you order
ginger ale instead?
Having a beautiful face?
Do you resist
concluding that you're
entitled to people
being nice to you
because of it?
Lots of the effects
we're considering
come from the statement
side of the table.
The features of your biology
that you were just
handed by luck.
Some of them concern
how efficiently
your gut absorbs nutrients
versus flushing them
down the toilet.
How readily fat
is stored or mobilized.
Whether you tend
to accumulate fat
in your butt
or abdomen.
The former is healthier.
Whether stress hormones
strengthen that propensity.
Great news!
You can still be judgmental.
Life's caprices
may bless some people
and curse others
as to their natural
attributes, you say.
But what really matters
is your self-discipline
when playing the hand
you were dealt.
But some of these
genetic effects
are harder to categorize
as to which side
of the table
they should be placed.
For example,
genes code for types
of taste receptors
in your tongue.
Hmm, is this merely
a biological attribute
such that even though
food might taste better
to you than to others
you are still expected
to resist gluttony?
Or is it possible
for food to taste
so good
that it cannot be resisted?
Hormones like leptin
that signal
whether you feel full
generate some similar
difficulties in categorizing.
And then there are
genetic effects
related to obesity
that are squarely
on the question
side of the chart.
The world where
we're judged
for the backbone
and character
we bring to our
natural attributes.
The genetics
of how many
dopamine neurons
you formed
mediating anticipation
and reward.
The genetics
of how much
pictures of appealing
food activate
those neurons
when you're dieting.
How intensely
stress produces
cravings for
high-carb,
high-fat foods.
How averse
hunger feels.
And of course
how readily
your frontal cortex
regulates parts
of the hypothalamus
relevant to hunger
bringing in
the ever-present
issue of willpower.
Once again
both sides
of the chart
are made
of the same
biology.
This scientific
truth has had
zero impact
on the general public.
Encouraging studies
show that the
average levels
of implicit
unconscious bias
against people
as a function
of their race,
age,
or sexual orientation
have all decreased
significantly over
the last decade,
but not implicit
biases against
obese individuals.
They've gotten worse.
Significantly,
it's there among
medical students,
particularly among
those who are thin,
white,
and male.
even your average
obese individual
shows implicit
anti-obesity
biases,
unconsciously
associating obesity
with laziness.
This sort of
self-loathing
is rare among
stigmatized groups.
And this self-loathing
has a price.
For example,
for people with
the same diet
and BMI,
internalizing an
anti-obesity bias
triples the chances
of metabolic disease.
Throw in the
explicit biases,
and we have the
world in which
the obese
are discriminated
against when it
comes to jobs,
housing,
health care,
and one where
stigma typically
worsens obesity
rather than
magically generating
successful willpower.
In other words,
a realm in which
people's lives
are ruined,
where they are
blamed for biology
over which
they had no control.
And what happened
when the person
I was speaking with
fully grasped
the implications
of what
the leptin
mutation means?
It was the start
of my no longer
thinking of myself
as a fat pig,
of being my own
worst bully.
Over and over
and over.
Everywhere you look,
there's that pain
and self-loathing,
staining all of life
about traits
that are
manifestations of
biology.
I find myself
beating myself up
at times,
wondering why
I can't get
my shit together.
Wondering if
these disorders
say something
about my character,
writes Sam
about his
bipolar disorder.
Over the years,
I started to assume
I was just lazy.
Instead of thinking
there might be
something wrong
biologically,
I assumed it
was all my fault.
And every time
I'd resolve to be
better at being
attentive in class,
or neat or
diligent about
homework,
I'd inevitably fail,
wrote Ariel
about her ADHD.
I called myself
evil,
cold,
weird,
said Marianne
about her
autism spectrum
disorder.
Again and again,
the same voice,
in domains where
blame is as absurd
as deciding that
you are responsible
for your height.
Oh,
but then there's
blame even there.
My mom,
five foot six,
and my dad,
six foot one,
constantly yell
at me for being
short,
saying I'm not
active enough
and don't sleep
enough,
writes one
unnamed person.
And Manas,
living in India,
at the intersection
of issues of
height and of
the societal
obsession with
shades of
brownness,
writes,
I grew taller
than everyone
at home because
I had an active
lifestyle.
I might be
tall,
but I am
darker than
the rest of
the people at
home.
That goes
to show
that we win
in some areas
but lose
in others.
The deep
misattributed
pain made
clear when
because appears.
Then there's
the learning
about someone's
own differentness.
I was so
liberated knowing
that there is a
name for what
I am experiencing,
writes Kat about
her bipolar
disorder,
Erin about
her borderline
personality disorder.
My struggles
with mental
ill health
were validated.
Sam about
his mood
disorder.
The discovery
that your
first diet
or binge
didn't cause
your eating
disorder.
Your first
cut didn't
cause your
depression.
Michelle writes
about her
ADHD.
Everything
fell into
place.
I wasn't
crap because
I found
tax returns
painful,
blurted out
stuff and
was messy.
I wasn't
crap at all.
I have a
neurodifference.
Marianne
about her
autism.
I wished
only that I
hadn't lost
so much of
my life
hating myself.
And all
the while,
chaoticism
teaches us
that being
normal is
an impossibility,
that it
ultimately just
means that you
have the same
sorts of
abnormalities
that are
accepted as
out of our
control that
everyone else
has.
Hey, it's
normal that you
can't cause
objects to
levitate.
Then there's
the liberation
of understanding
that what you
mistook as
the consequences
of different
choices could
be nothing
more than a
butterfly flapping
its wings.
I once spent
a day teaching
some incarcerated
men about
the brain.
Afterward,
one guy asked
me,
my brother and
I grew up in
the same house.
He's the vice
president of a
bank.
How'd I wind
up like this?
We talked,
figured out a
likely explanation
for his
brother.
By whatever
hiccup of
chance,
his motor
cortex and
visual cortex
gave him
great hand-eye
coordination,
and he
happened to
be spotted
playing pickup
basketball by
the right
person,
who got him
a scholarship
to the fancy
prep school
on the other
side of the
tracks that
groomed him
into the
ruling class.
Then there is
one of the
deepest sources
of pain.
I once
lectured at
an elementary
school about
other primates.
Afterward,
a deeply
homely
child asked
if baboons
cared if
you're not
pretty.
As Wicked's
ostracized
green-skinned
Elphaba sings
about a boy
who could
make someone
feel loved
and desired,
she concludes,
he could be
that boy,
but I'm
not that girl.
And every time
someone less
attractive is
less likely to
be hired,
to get a
raise,
to be voted
for,
to be exonerated
by a jury,
an implicit
belief is
being expressed
that lack
of beauty
on the
outside
and lack
of beauty
on the
inside
go hand
in hand.
Naturally,
sexuality
comes into
this too.
In 1991,
the superb
neuroscientist
Simon LeVay
at the
Salk Institute
rocked the
world with
front-page
news.
LeVay,
gay and
still reeling
from the
death of the
love of his
life from
AIDS,
had discovered
a part of
the brain
that differed
structurally
depending on
whether you
loved people
of your
gender
or the
opposite
one.
Sexual
orientation
as a
biological
trait.
A release
from the
cesspool
of a
pastor
whose
church
would
picket
funerals
with signs
saying
God hates
fags
from medieval
conversion
therapy.
As Lady
Gaga sings,
God makes
no mistakes.
I'm on the
right track,
baby.
I was born
this way.
For the
lucky,
this was
no news,
something they'd
known all
along.
For the
less fortunate,
there was
release from
the belief
that they
could have,
should have,
chosen to
love differently
than they
did,
or the
revelation
could have
been among
those on
the outside.
Parents
writing to
LeVay about
being freed
from the
likes of,
if only I
hadn't
encouraged him
to pursue
arts camp
instead of
basketball camp,
he wouldn't
have turned
out gay.
Blame
shows up
as well
concerning
fertility,
where a
woman's
lack of
reproductive
potency
can prompt
a doctor
to grossly
exaggerate the
effects of
stress on
fertility.
You're too
uptight,
you're too
type A,
where
psychoanalytic
toxins still
fester.
The problem
is your
ambivalence
about having
a child,
where blame
is heaped
on lifestyle
choices.
You wouldn't
have had the
abortion that
left scar
tissue in
your uterus
if you
hadn't slept
around and
been careless.
Where, as
studies show,
infertility can
be as
psychiatrically
debilitating
as cancer.
A particularly
pernicious
consequence of
misplaced belief
in captaining
your own ship
comes with the
work of Duke
University
epidemiologist
Sherman
James.
He described
a personality
style that he
called John
Henryism.
Named for
the American
folk hero,
the railroad
construction
worker who
drove steel
with unmatched
strength,
challenged by
his boss to
compete against
a new machine
doing the
same,
he vowed
that no
machine was
going to
keep him
down,
battled,
and defeated
it, only
to then
drop dead
from exhaustion.
The John
Henryism profile
is one of
someone who
feels like
they can take
on any
challenge if
they apply
themselves
enough,
endorsing
statements
on a
questionnaire
like,
when things
don't go
the way I
want them
to,
that just
makes me
work even
harder,
or,
I've always
felt that I
could make
of my life
pretty much
what I
wanted to
make of
it.
Well,
what's wrong
with that?
It sounds
like a good,
healthy locus
of control.
Unless,
like John
Henry,
you were an
African-American
blue-collar
worker or
sharecropper,
where this
attributional
style results
in a greatly
increased risk
of cardiovascular
disease.
It's a
pathogenic
belief that
with enough
effort,
you could
overcome a
racist system
guaranteed to
keep you
down.
A fatal
belief that
you should
be able to
control the
uncontrollable.
There's our
nation with
its cult of
meritocracy
that judges
your worth
by your IQ
and your
number of
degrees.
A nation
that spews
bilge about
equal economic
potential,
while as of
2021,
the top
1% has
32% of
the wealth
and the
bottom half
less than
3%,
where you
can find
an advice
column
headlined,
It's not
your fault
if you are
born poor,
but it's
your fault
if you die
poor,
which goes
on to say
that if that
was your
lamentable
outcome,
I'll say
you're a
wasted sperm.
Having a
neuropsychiatric
disorder,
having been
born into
a poor
family,
having the
wrong face
or skin
color,
having the
wrong ovaries,
loving the
wrong gender,
not being
smart enough,
beautiful enough,
successful enough,
extroverted
enough,
lovable enough,
hatred,
loathing,
disappointment,
the have-nots
persuaded to
believe that
they deserve
to be where
they are
because of
the blemish
on their
face or
their brain,
all wrapped
in the
lie of
a just
world.
In
1911,
the poet
Morris Rosenfeld
wrote the
song
Where I
Rest,
at a time
when it
was the
immigrant
Italians,
Irish,
Poles,
and Jews
who were
exploited in
the worst
jobs,
worked to
death,
or burned
to death
in sweatshops.
It always
brings me
to tears.
Provides
one
metaphor
for the
lives
of the
unlucky.
Where I
Rest
Look not
for me
in nature's
greenery,
you will
not find
me there,
I fear,
where lives
are wasted
by machinery,
that is
where I
rest,
my dear.
Look not
for me
where birds
are singing,
enchanting
songs find
not my
ear,
for in
my slavery
chains
a-ringing,
is the
music
I do
hear.
Not
where the
streams
of life
are flowing,
I draw
not from
these
fountains
clear,
but where
we reap
what greed
is sowing,
hungry
teeth
and falling
tears.
But if
your heart
does love
me truly,
join it
with mine
and hold
me near.
then will
this world
of toil
and cruelty
die in
birth of
Eden
here.
It is
the events
of one
second
before
to a
million
years
before
that
determine
whether
your life
and loves
unfold next
to bubbling
streams
or machines
choking you
with sooty
smoke,
whether at
graduation
ceremonies
you wear
the cap
and gown
or bag
the garbage.
Whether the
thing you
are viewed
as deserving
is a long
life of
fulfillment
or a long
prison sentence,
there is no
justifiable
deserve.
The only
possible moral
conclusion
is that you
are no more
entitled to
have your
needs and
desires met
than is
any other
human,
that there
is no
human who
is less
worthy than
you to
have their
well-being
considered.
You may
think
otherwise
because you
can't
conceive of
the threads
of causality
beneath the
surface
that made
you you,
because you
have the
luxury of
deciding that
effort and
self-discipline
aren't made
of biology,
because you
have surrounded
yourself with
people who
think the
same.
But this
is where the
science has
taken us,
and we need
to accept the
absurdity of
hating any
person for
anything they've
done.
ultimately that
hatred is
sadder than
hating the
sky for
storming,
hating the
earth when
it quakes,
hating a
virus because
it's good at
getting into
lung cells.
This is where
the science has
brought us as
well.
Not everyone
agrees.
They suggest
that the
science that
has filled
these pages
is about the
statistical
properties of
populations,
unable to
predict enough
about the
individual.
They suggest
that we
don't know
enough yet,
but we
know that
every step
higher in
an adverse
childhood
experience score
increases the
odds of
adult antisocial
behavior by
about 35%.
Given that,
we already
know enough.
We know
that your
life expectancy
will vary by
30 years,
depending on
the country
you're born
in.
20 years,
depending on
the American
family into
which you
happen to
be born.
We already
know enough.
And we
already know
enough because
we understand
that the
biology of
frontocortical
function explains
why at
life's junctures
some people
consistently make
the wrong
decision.
We already
know enough
to understand
that the
endless people
whose lives
are less
fortunate than
ours don't
implicitly
deserve to
be invisible.
99% of
the time,
I can't
remotely
achieve this
mindset.
But there
is nothing
to do but
try,
because it
will be
freeing.
Those in
the future
will marvel
at what
we didn't
yet know.
There will
be scholars
opining about
why in the
course of a
few decades
around the
start of
the third
millennium,
most Americans
stopped
opposing gay
marriage.
History majors
will struggle
on final exams
to remember
whether it
was the
19th,
20th,
or 21st
century when
people began
to understand
epigenetics.
They will
view us as
being as
ignorant as
we view the
goitered peasants
who thought
Satan caused
seizures.
That borders
on the
inevitable.
But it
need not be
inevitable that
they also
view us as
heartless.
