this is audible summary homo deus a brief history of tomorrow by readtrepreneur publishing narrated by lynn benson
the book at a glance harare begins by introducing the readers to the three major problems the world has faced and overcome namely famine plague and war
mankind should be more content now that his life is practically free from these common sources of misery however mankind does not settle for the simple things in life instead he embarks on a more ambitious quest to become like god
the author goes on to explain some theories why man considers himself a special being through time man has evolved from simple-minded individuals to highly intelligent beings
humans try to set themselves apart from other creations by saying that only they have souls and consciousness latest scientific advancements and the theory of evolution however debunk the existence of the human soul
scientists have also proven that animals too have a certain level of consciousness though there is much to learn in this field of understanding the mind and its consciousness significant data have shown that the mind works by nothing more than
electrochemical signals man's intellect has also led him to invent codes that will soon become one of the most important means of expressing oneself
the development of writing has affected the lives of people how these simple codes paved the way for humanity to be divided into two distinct groups the educated and the dumb
humans have become more controlled and labeled as exemplified in the evaluation system of formal education
writing has also become a way for man to make records and stories such as the bible this book has been the tool used in the quest for more money and fame and occasionally spiritual maturity
people have always believed in god until man found ways to disprove his existence science and religion have always clashed against each other
science has proven time and again that everything has an explanation while religion claims that there are things beyond human comprehension
it has always been a challenge for mankind to marry science and religion the result of which is foreseen to be favorable for a modern and civil society
harari also discusses how humans have become very neglectful of the environment despite all the warning signals the earth is showing to mankind science and technology have been used to give man
all the comforts they need despite the destruction that these are causing to nature harari describes man's present state as being too confident of himself and his abilities that he finds lesser need to rely on gods and other religious beliefs
making ethical judgments have also become easier through formulas and numerical computations everything nowadays is seen as codes algorithms and data that can be processed and translated to sound and justified decisions
as man's intellect leads him to higher grounds of growth and progress he also tends to lose control over this newfound power what is initially meant to serve man may also be the cause of his ruin and despair
technology and medicine keeps on improving with the aim of serving mankind however with the insatiable appetite of man for growth and progress
computers and superhumans may result in the collapse of mankind this disparity between the elites and the less privileged mass will get bigger until there is already a great social inequity
harari predicts that there will be two types of religion which will emerge due to man's quest for happiness divinity and peace techno humanism and data religion
the former speaks of man still hanging on to his authority over his decisions while the latter is about man relying on data in making decisions for him
the future is seen with humans relying heavily on data and disregarding their inner voice in making decisions man is foreseen to be constantly connected to the internet and constantly feeding it data for the use of the society although there is no certainty to this prediction the current events show
that this future is very likely to happen unless man changes his actions and steers the future in another direction
part one homo sapiens conquers the world chapter one the new human agenda
famine plague and war partly because of these things people in the third millennium are already starting to wake up to the reality that god does not exist people are now more systematic in their problem solving approach they don't need to blame a god or say that the dreadful things that happen are part of his will and plan when something
wrong happens humanity knows humanity knows that it is the cause of human error humanity can now formulate solutions to practically any world problem however with major problems already having their pre-set solutions humanity seems to be getting bored and somehow
is looking for problems that can give life more meaning and interest instead of sitting back and relaxing man is trying to find
an excuse to use the power that he has but first how did humanity get famine poverty and war under control the author illustrates the famine experience in france in the year 1864 due to the high price of food and commodities the impoverished population was left to eat unclean things in edible plants and the blood of animals the famine of
1864 1864 in france also became a platform for opportunistic rich people who instead of helping their poor brethren took advantage of the situation by charging inflated prices to food that they hoarded the king at the time louis the fourteenth only cared about his mistresses and his own comforts even china which has billions of people in its population experienced famine in ancient times up until
the time of the time of the communist reform movement because of developments in agriculture and food production famine is eradicated in all of china famine and death by starvation have been overcome by mankind even in times of calamities and natural phenomenon tsunamis drought typhoons etc the global community has been able to aid each other by providing enough food and clean water to those in need
there are even corporations and organizations that seized the opportunity brought by calamities to market themselves and make their names known this is a win-win situation the people receive health the big corporations make more money in the long run because of their exposure
there still are places with isolated cases of people dying of starvation but these are very exceptional cases more people nowadays die from overeating than from hunger medical statistics show how diabetes obesity and cardiovascular diseases kill more people compared to those who died from diseases or terrorist attacks
and try to limit themselves to salads and bread while poor people munch on cheetos hamburgers and pizza malnutrition is still prevalent in some parts of the world but these people are still able to survive with just enough calories provided to them by government safety nets next to famine the author also discusses the origins of infectious diseases and how these spread throughout the world
in medieval times did not have the medieval times did not have the knowledge of bacteria and viruses as these organisms are too minute to be observed by the naked eye a drop of water may appear to be clear when in fact millions of bacteria are already in that droplet when viewed with the modern day microscope
in the olden days man hung on to the prayers gods and rituals for salvation against plagues and diseases man tried to understand these infectious diseases as god's way of showing that he is displeased with man now however science has pinpointed global trade and colonization to be the major causes of epidemics people coming from europe brought infections with them to the americas
the natives who had no immunity from these infections were almost wiped out in a matter of days at the dawn of the 20th century advancements in medicine and science have significantly lowered the mortality rates from infectious diseases with the proper medical intervention infectious diseases were no longer considered fatal global campaigns on hygiene and cleanliness were conducted worldwide these health
programs contributed to the improved health condition of communities and individuals the discovery of vaccines also led to the eradication of many diseases including smallpox recently doctors have even developed a new type of antibiotic called taxobactin to which bacteria have no resistance another medical advancement that is being anticipated
that can navigate through the blood stream aiding in the identification and cure of an individual sickness while biotechnology is indeed a remarkable scientific breakthrough malicious individuals such as terrorists are obtaining this knowledge and using it to conjure new pathogens to be used in biochemical warfare the wrong use of biotechnology may give rise to new mutations
and highly resistive infections another perennial problem of man is war mankind always leaves room for war even during times of peace in ancient times human violence was the cause of fifteen percent of deaths nowadays violence causes only five percent of deaths war and crime have killed millions of people in 2012 alone
these acts of violence these acts of violence are brought forth by the desire to amass more wealth and power material resources such as gold and oil were the primary sources of profit from the ancient times up until near the 20th century but now information and knowledge determine the height of power one can scale knowledge is indeed power many wealthy corporations use this strategy
to increase their assets and expand their riches for example the knowledge of Congo's rich coltan mines was utilized by Rwanda stealing this raw material and selling it to manufacturers of cellular phones Rwanda earned millions of dollars in revenue out of stealing from Congo China on the other hand made peaceful business negotiations with tech giants
giants and achieved greater financial success and achieved greater financial success than Rwanda in one day peace has also been given a new hippie meaning countries can be at peace now but who's to say what next year will bring invasions and war can still happen based on the plans of one country affecting the other war is always an option in this new kind of peace
today new forms of war are being deployed cyber war is especially on the rise with the world leaning more on technology it's a relief that there aren't many incentives to put cyber warfare in motion it's just there to keep everything in check to keep the new peace in place Anton Chekhov once said that a gun appearing at the first act will be fired in the third
however modern man has made many guns and bombs that have not been fired these weapons are mainly kept as a show of power to other nations like a warning sign of their capability to destroy still there are some leaders who are tempted to use their newly acquired weapons ancient times used the law of the jungle to conquer and invade but now freedom democracy and diplomacy are the laws that govern
in mankind in the case of terrorism it is likened to a fly which is basically weak and powerless the fly buzzes in the ear of a bull until it is maddened and causes destruction to the fly's adversaries likewise terrorists are weak groups who use the truly powerful people or nations to defeat their enemies an example of this is the Muslim fundamentalists who
who enraged the USA so that the latter attacked Iraq capturing and killing Saddam Hussein in the process if people give in to the reins of terrorists humankind will go back to using the law of the jungle man has surpassed many primitive challenges and has achieved so much in the past years new forms of comfort and advancements are supposed to make man contented with the kind of life he is living
however this is not the case man has an insatiable appetite for achieving beyond what he already has man tries to be like the gods he idolizes omnipotent omniscient omnipresent this is the daring goal that man hungers to achieve despite the large control man has over the many forces and phenomenon in this world bigger ambitions still drive man's quest for power
today's society is past worrying about food insecurities money and other material comforts it is now focusing on obtaining more happiness and divinity in life man is now preoccupied with obtaining immortality
man has been in search of the fountain of youth since time immemorial and in the 21st century it is slowly becoming possible to attain everlasting life it seems that money and a healthy body are the only prerequisites to extending one's life ancient religions have always viewed death as
an event to be anticipated however modern times have looked upon death as a technical failure death and accidents are now seen as events that could have been prevented or evaded the human body used to be sacred and mysterious now it is treated as a machine with technical problems which can be easily fixed with drugs and medical procedures rich and famous personalities
such as aubrey degray ray curse wheel bill maris and peter thiel are some of those who subscribe to the belief that man can live forever breakthroughs in genetic engineering and regenerative medicine bring with it promises of immortality harari also illustrates some setbacks to being immortal or having an extraordinary long life one must stay in perfect health all the time
resulting in many anxieties you could not simply eat out for fear of food poisoning thrilling activities such as mountain climbing bungee jumping swimming in the sea and cliff diving would also be prohibited since attaining immortality costs a huge fortune and it would be such a waste if you ended up dying anyway many people also find the thought of regaining their younger bodies back appealing
even today many people undergo expensive cosmetic procedures just to retain their youthful appearance the exterior shell of a person may be kept looking youthful but modern medicine has yet to discover a way to keep the internal body systems from aging
there has and always will be a struggle for eternal youth people with money have proven that they would do anything just to keep looking and feeling young
on another end of the spectrum epicureanism is slowly becoming a popular world view more and more people are subscribing to the belief that there is no life after death life expectancy is now longer than ever and yet happiness still
seems to be far from man's reach it still takes a lot of arduous work to achieve happiness there is no one pill or fix that can make a man happy for the rest of his life
does material wealth alone equal happiness apparently not data has shown that developing countries with many impoverished communities have lower suicide rates compared to first world countries for example in the philippines there is
one in 100,000 people committing suicide while in south korea a far more developed country 30 in 100,000 people do so
despite the glaring evidence that wealth does not equate to happiness nation states are striving to beat each other's gdp instead of focusing on the happiness and well-being of its people
schools are established to produce skilled and productive individuals not necessarily happy ones
health systems have also been introduced with millions of the national budget being allotted for hygiene
vaccination and cleanliness of the environment however these health measures are not meant to produce happy people
these only strengthen the nation's overall health condition
british philosopher jeremy bingham believed that the government should be made responsible for the happiness of its people
he further stated that any dissatisfaction of the citizenry is a violation of the basic human right to happiness
consequently being happy requires a lot of effort joy is now harder than ever to bring to people even in prehistoric times man was contented with the bare necessities
now there is a cacophony of factors to consider in achieving happiness
modern medicine has now made it possible for man to be happy through the discovery of prescription drugs
essentially happiness is an effect of chemical reactions and sensations in the body drugs can activate the release of hormones that make a person feel happy
depression mental illness and the occasional blues can now be cured in an instant
this biochemical pursuit to happiness however leads to drug related crimes all over the world
happiness is viewed as the supreme good but it is also ephemeral and fleeting
it causes one to crave more happiness after the sensations have faded
giant corporations use this knowledge as leverage for their business ventures
the author mentions three ways that man can be upgraded to godly beings
one biological engineering two cyborg engineering or three engineering of
non-organic beings with these methods man will be able to manipulate and control pain death and life
biological engineering seeks to rewrite man's genetic code
this aims to regenerate lost limbs or rewire brain circuitry
cyborg engineering is the fusion of man and machine this already exists with the example
of monkeys being able to control bionic hands and feet disconnected from their bodies with the use of
electrodes installed in its brain humans are establishing a massive interaction with technology
people can already have microchips installed in their bodies these chips can store vast amounts of
information which can be used for numerous automated functions such as operating machines and making
electronic payments man keeps on trying to be like the gods they know however divinity has also been
shown to have its limits even the stories of jesus zeus and indra are filled with human problems
such as love hate and pain furthermore true godly powers include being able to manipulate the weather
change physical forms in seconds travel great distances in an instant and read minds
humans have been able to surpass the promises of their gods they have created better tools to help
them survive on this planet no god ever came down to water the crops or apply pesticides these feats are
born out of human ingenuity and innovation the same can be said for medical breakthroughs
scientists use the excuse of healing in their endeavors for stronger medicines better genetic
modifications and other upgrades mankind is always looking for ways to make the next generation better
free from abnormalities and lethal disabilities a human baby can now be designed in test tubes and its
genetic makeup can be chosen for it human reproduction isn't a lottery anymore it can be engineered
and modified although some states have banned this medical practice for ethical reasons there may still be
scientists undertaking covert genetic science experiments at present humans are gaining more information
information every second technology medicine arts everything is progressing at breakneck speed because of
this man's way of living is constantly changing the new knowledge gained every day makes it more
difficult to predict humanity's future carl marx once predicted that the capitalist system would collapse
because of the crimes against humanity because of the crimes against humanity happening during
the industrial revolution in effect british and french leaders have to develop new laws that would
protect the workers and provide better labor compensations marx's prediction never happened but it caused a
massive change in the capitalist countries changes that can still be felt in these modern times
humans are always trying to be a step ahead of the future of course this is never really true but scholars
still strive to broaden the horizon and peek into the future studying and acknowledging the past helps us to steer a
better course towards the future the future based on the past is easy to predict but with new discoveries
happening every day the future is becoming more and more diverse and unpredictable humans like to make
themselves feel like gods and are constantly trying to gain more life happiness and divinity they believe
this could be achieved through a more technology dependent world humans have always been afraid of change
although conversely they constantly act in its favor
it is now the age of the anthropocene the time of man human population is now greater than that of
animals mankind has made such profound changes in the world for the last seventy thousand years humans have
caused massive extinctions in many prehistoric animals because of their need to survive
prehistoric men believed that the earth is shared by all living creatures they believed that each living
thing has a spirit which could communicate and connect with that of others up until now many people still
believe that animals are not so different from people that they can feel and think as we do even the bible
shows that humans can interact with animals when the serpent talked and tempted adam into
eating the forbidden fruit however there might also be a hidden meaning in these bible verses that
suggest the snake is actually eve since the etymology of the word eve means snake or serpent bible scholars
therefore suggest that humans may have evolved from reptiles humans are however too vain to accept that they could
possibly come from species of inferior nature humans have always exhibited the power of dominion over
all animals of land air and sea domestication of animals has been a practice that allows humans to
keep animals as friends slaves or a source of food animals have suffered in numerous ways in the hands of man man has
continuously neglected the emotional social and intellectual needs of the animals in his care one example
is the breeding sow kept in a crate that is just big enough for it to stand and lie down the sow stays there for
most of its life breeding piglets that are eventually forcibly weaned at very young ages
of two to four weeks and then separated from the mother to be fattened and slaughtered this is a very pitiful
state for most animals and it is a tragedy brought about by the agricultural revolution scientists have studied animal
biochemical algorithms that translate to emotions while humans have machines that can perform algorithms for
them animals only have their bodies and instincts to do the calculation for them if they are able to
correctly calculate their probabilities they could survive humans and animals also share similar emotional
experiences an example of which is the mother-infant bond young animals need their mothers for survival
and this is especially true for mammals that feed and nurture their young through breastfeeding
during the 1950s 1960s studies and experiments on monkeys done by harry harlow showed that mammals can't live on
material needs alone but more importantly on emotional bonds while farmers give their animals food shelter and other
material needs it is still cruel for them to neglect the social and emotional well-beings of those animals
they justified their actions with theist beliefs that god gave man dominion over all animals this belief has
led men to exploit animals in numerous ways several religions have stories of how god regarded animals and man
the bible tells the story of noah who was instructed by god to save his family and two of every kind of animal
in a large wooden ark after which god sends a deluge that cleansed the earth of man's wickedness along with all other living organisms
the epic of gilgamesh also narrates how the gods sent a deluge to the earth killing all living things
in it when there were no more humans to sacrifice meat to the gods they became mad with hunger these beliefs solidified
man's sense of entitlement that animals are made solely for his use and control during the scientific revolution
man used his advanced intellect to develop drugs that can be injected to farm animals to make them bigger or increase their production of milk or eggs
these genetic modifications allowed man to feed the ever-growing population of the earth
chapter three the human spark
presently humans are the most powerful creatures in the world and they are at the top of the food chain
there is a belief however that among humans some lives are considered more valuable than others
there is a human spark that makes humans believe there is something special about them that they are created
for a higher purpose humans strongly believe in the concept of souls and life after death
this continues to influence the lives of billions of people on the earth
despite all the studies done by scientists and life sciences experts there has been no evidence that humans
have this so-called soul however the research runs on in the hope that scientists just haven't looked
carefully enough and that the human soul does exist
a lot of people still reject the theory of evolution by charles darwin they prefer to believe in the
story of creation as it is written in the bible the thought that humans are the intelligent and superior
design of god gives men comfort and a high regard for themselves the theory of evolution is shunned
because it states that humans came from simpler life forms humans just can't accept that they could
possibly come from inferior beings such as a single-celled protozoan or a less intellectual ape
the theory of evolution also implies that there is no soul since every living form on earth must have
parts that should be able to evolve through natural selection however the soul being immutable and
indivisible means that it has no parts and therefore it cannot possibly exist
the farthest that science has come to find the very essence of the human existence is the dna
this sets one person apart from another it is the distinct genetic makeup of every living being on earth
the dna is also capable of mutation and evolution which gives further credibility to the theory of
evolution humans have had this superiority complex since time immemorial though the soul has no known proof
yet one abstraction that is clearly observed in human existence is the stream of consciousness humans
continuously crave and desire something in their lives they experience doubt and fear and a myriad of all other
sensations rene descartes the father of modern philosophy once stated that only humans have consciousness
and that animals are only like machines animals simply react according to their biochemical algorithms
without any emotion or sensation behind it even scientists before would operate on animals without
giving them anesthetics just to see how they react and how their organs function up to this day some people
still subscribe to the idea that animals have no consciousness and if they did have it it would be significantly inferior
science still has much to learn about the workings of the mind and consciousness the firing of brain signals
remains largely a mystery despite the advancement of science and technology the mind is the seat of power of any living being
it is the tool used for feeling sensations such as fear or hunger and these sensations help humans survive and thrive
the mind is also a limitless storage of data thoughts and imaginations the mind is different from the brain
as the brain is the physical part while the mind is intangible numbers and computations can be used to predict
probabilities in anything that has algorithms but the mind has subjective experiences that cannot be
computed the mind is unpredictable and diverse there are many sensations that cannot be computed such as pain
hunger pleasure or love google and tesla are just some of the companies who are innovating technology with
artificial intelligence there are now autonomous cars that can cruise roads and stop at red lights
without the need for a human driver although the car can make signals when turning right or slowing down it does not
have a consciousness it does not desire anything rather it just functions based on how it is programmed
in the same way natural phenomena such as lightning or earthquakes were once thought to be the will of god
but with science man has now learned the process of lightning and earthquakes and has even given a scientific
explanation for it it's not anymore because of god's wrath or god's punishment for men to test whether
something has a mind a human being must be able to communicate with a computer using text messages without the
human knowing that he or she is actually talking to a computer the test is referred to as the turing test
developed by alan turing during the 1950s he predicted that in the future it won't matter whether a computer
has consciousness or not but rather whatever humans thought about it nowadays there are machines that can
detect and record brain signals which are proof of consciousness of a living being these signals are
transmitted mostly as beeps or lines new zealand was the first country in the world to recognize that animals are
sentient beings bringing forth animal rights legislation rats undergo swim tests in laboratories to see
whether they had chemicals in their brains to make them despair or hope it showed that rats brains did
produce chemicals that made them swim for 15 minutes before giving up after being rescued and then put back in
the water they swam for 20 minutes before once again despairing and giving up the extra five minutes showed
that the rats held on to hope for a longer period of time if a rat exhibited this behavior of despairing
and hoping then clearly its brain must contain chemicals that can safely be determined as antidepressant and
depressant this is perhaps what drives corporations to make drugs that are stimulants and antidepressants
after animals have been established to have consciousness the next attempt is to know whether
animals have a sense of self-consciousness scientists argue that animals do not have conscious memories and that
the actions they exhibit such as storing food for winter or defending itself from predators
are all non-conscious algorithms however animals minds are different from that of humans thus there will be
no telling what really goes on in the animal's mind and how it perceives its environment skeptics and scientists
can only guess as much the cognitive abilities of animals are often undermined though many instances
have shown that animals are able to observe human reactions and act accordingly this was exhibited by
a horse in germany named hans the horse could answer math questions such as four times three correctly by
tapping its hoofs 12 times skeptics discovered that hans could tell when a human is expecting him to tap his
hooves and recognized when he has already reached the correct number of taps based on the amazed face of
the person or the cheering and clapping of the audience humans have been able to progress because of their
intellect and ability to make tools another ability that made humans the most dominating creature on the
planet is cooperation in large numbers elephants and chimps also show cooperation but only
with family members or a small group of close friends humans can cooperate even with strangers and this helped
greatly in the ascent to the top of the food chain humans have shown the effects of large scale
cooperation and how it shaped history one example is the downfall of the communist dictator nicolai
hosescu wherein during his speech a person from an audience booed this single boo caused a chain of
boos and ultimately the whole crowd was booing him off the stage this demonstrated that among this
demonstrated that among strangers an informal organization can happen in an instant when the mass has a unified
feeling about their current condition this event was the turning point of the romanian revolution no
longer did the people want to simply obey the commands given by that man in the balcony and it all started
with one person who dared to boo
concescu
man has had numerous achievements because of the ability to cooperate in vast numbers humans do not
scream and project hostilities towards each other as apes and chimpanzees do when they first meet
other animal groups require intimate acquaintances before they can cooperate with each other
scientists and psychologists try to decipher this human behavior by either testing animals in
laboratories or by observing a small group of humans or by observing a small group of humans
these do not have accurate and relevant results because the dynamics of a small group do not exactly
translate to the dynamics of a society humans can dominate the earth because they can create beliefs
laws and they have a creative imagination it is also observed that humans believe in one of two realities
one objective reality and two subjective reality the former is the reality that exists independent of the mind
while the latter is based on what a person believes or feels this is however there is however a third kind
of reality called the intersubjective reality this type of reality depends on what is agreed upon by many
humans money and currency are some examples of intersubjective realities the value of money or a certain currency
can change based on whatever is agreed upon in the stock market intersubjective reality
can also refer to the meaning of something traditions religions beliefs rituals these are all based on
agreements made between people in certain groups these meanings can change later on and that is why it is
intersubjective it can go on changing and evolving as per the needs of the community it serves
what was important to our ancestors long ago may be meaningless to the current generation the crusades
were an important thing during the medieval times whereas now it is being played out as a parody in comedy
bars and television sitcoms though this is the case there are still many humans who are bent on proving that
their fictional beliefs are real
part two homo sapiens gives meaning to the world chapter four the storytellers
humans make up stories that affect the world's fears and wishes in order to gain followers
clever humans made up stories about gods humans with lesser intellect believed the web of stories about gods their powers and the need to worship and offer to them
the invention of writing and the concept of money allowed the gods to get rich acquire more material possessions and more power over time gods were made real in the form of humans as exemplified by an egyptian pharaoh
the physical manifestation of a god reinforced the belief and trust of the people gods created by ancient people are no different from gods of modern times corporations like google and microsoft are likened to gods which needed human workers to sustain its survival
many people work for these big companies the companies the companies are technically immortal as many people believe in them and rely on them for certain information and services that they provide
other brands include celebrities like elvis presley who even after death continues to be worshipped like a god there is still a conglomerate of lawyers producers and agents working for the king continuing the business and sustaining the success of the brand
the invention of writing further organized the algorithms that societies had leaders and their officials could easily communicate with each other through writing they could determine the best strategies based on algorithmic calculations of the data gathered from their societies these societies therefore flourished due to the successful calculation of probabilities keeping the people satisfied and or
organized writing something down produces a record that is highly valued as evidentiary support in times of dispute what is written becomes as real as any concrete object man has since developed a deep respect for documents a good example of which is the rescue of thousands of jews during the holocaust with the use of stamped visas
susa mendez a portugal consul issued thousands of portuguese visas to jews though he was strictly prohibited from doing so the stamped documents allowed the jews entry into portugal saving them from the horrific fates other jews suffered under the nazis
even the present legal system does not care what is the truth rather it takes sides based on the strength of the evidence presented the only thing that matters is what has been recorded regardless of whether it is the truth or a faked evidence
our modern day educational system is a good example of how writing changes people's lives the high grades or marks given to a student usually paved the way for better employment and a more financially secure life
holy scriptures is another means of control of leaders and high priests during the ancient times not only did intellectual humans then use writing for keeping records of material offerings to the gods
they also wrote down commandments and stories about the gods and endorsed these as real to the unsuspecting populace it took great writers to make good stories stories that struck the perfect balance between reality and fiction
the story sounded very credible and the gods were able to sustain their power for many years no one dared to object these beliefs because these were written down and established as the truth and reality
these writings led to the organization of mass societies leaders used writings such as codes and laws to collect taxes and make megastructures such as pyramids and temples
those who were uneducated led miserable lives as slaves doing work in exchange for nothing
history goes to show that lives of prehistoric people were better than those of ancient people and modern day people prehistoric people weren't measured with yardsticks and grading systems they just foraged and hunted getting their basic needs met
no one ordered them around with a set of made-up rules there were no gods who needed offerings and demanded free labor
up to this day many people still serve in the name of their gods sacrificing their lives for something fictional chapter five the odd couple
science and religion have always clashed against each other as science progressed it sought to answer the myths brought forth by religion
religious people argue that there are many inexplicable things in this world when humans could not understand or explain something they readily point their fingers to the gods
each world religion holds their own dogmas rules and punishments they have their own rituals no one knows whose religion holds the truth and each party tries to indoctrinate the rest of the world about
the certainty of their beliefs and the existence of their gods people go into spiritual journeys in the hope that they will attain spiritual maturity it is no different from an academic journey when a student sets out to study for years take exams and reach the ultimate goal of finishing the course however there are instances when the person making the journey is led
to a different end other than what he planned to attain there are also certain groups of people who believe in dualism
a world governed by two gods one god is usually good while the other is evil the evil god used the everlasting souls created by the good god and locked them in his defective creations hence human bodies tend to die and rot whilst the souls escape and then
gets locked up again in another temporal body the goal of dualism is to free oneself from the material and temporary world this is not a religion but rather a quest for spiritual freedom it is even said that one should kill or rid oneself of rigid ideals and laws established by any religion even that of buddhism
martin luther was the founder of the protestant movement against the catholic church he saw that the catholic church sold indulgences to people in exchange for gold or silver
he didn't believe that the pope had the power to absolve people from their sins he exposed the catholic church for the corrupt and fraudulent actions
the protests of martin luther exhibited how humans can revolt against something they think is not right the result became profound when the rebellion was supported by a critical mass who shared the same sentiments
this showed that humans will always look for answers to their questions thus the never-ending search for the truth science and religion have always been seen as arch enemies religion has many factual claims such as god exists or wicked souls will be punished in the after life
science on the other hand cannot argue with these factual claims since there are no experiments yet that can prove or disprove the concepts science has always been useful in settling disputes that are ethical in nature
there are also instances when the study of a religion is necessary for understanding the history of science it took science a long time before it progressed it had to overcome any religious restrictions before it had the chance to flourish
the idea of an overarching being governing the universe gives comfort to many people religion always seeks to put societies in order science on the other hand seeks power for humans
religious groups tend to try to dominate one another by means of execution slavery or displacement the same is true for men of faith and men of science there is almost always a clash between these two factions
there have been many attempts to reconcile science with religion these two can actually cooperate in the search for truth
chapter six the modern covenant human lives are filled with endless attempts to gain relevance in the grand cosmic plan
they give meaning to their lives by going into conquests finding their purpose or joining organizations that share the same beliefs and goals that they have
conversely modernity is somewhat nihilistic modernity maintains that life provides us no script and that our lives do not have any meaning in the vast cosmos
this gives way to the many existential angsts that the modern culture is currently plagued with humans are still looking for the supreme being who promises them another dimension in exchange for the purposes they have served in the physical realm
during medieval times when the cottage industry was prevalent people lived life one day at a time predicting the growth of the future wasn't the main interest even if an individual wanted to pursue a scientific experiment that can say cure an illness his limited means would not be able to support his research
nowadays many banks and loaning agencies provide financial support to qualified individuals because they have a way to measure the success of a certain venture even before it has been started
before when there was a calamity or a disease outbreak people prayed to their gods now an epidemic is considered a business opportunity by pharmaceutical companies more business ventures translate
translate to a successful economy science too is able to flourish during economic growth while the economy is growing the human population is growing too more human needs seek to be met and standards of living are being raised every day humans need more and more stuff every day the poor remain poor and the rich get richer
the only way towards impartiality is for the rich to share their resources with the poor by giving them the portion of the pie they need to be on par with the rich
the modern world is sadly obsessed with growth this obsession leads to a clash in ethical judgment and factual statement
a daughter can work towards her financial independence but once her father has a stroke
then she will have to leave work early and take care of her father she will also have to assist him financially and shoulder his medical bills her personal financial growth will significantly suffer but it will give her the image of a caring daughter
such is the quest for growth that it tends to be a wheel that does not stop turning
capitalism capitalism is everywhere it is even inculcated in games such as minecraft or civilization
from an early age children are trained to be capitalists starting with a modest startup and investing in structures and businesses that can gain profit and eventually upgrade and purchase more properties and facilities
limited resources limited resources therefore pressure humans to find innovative ways to multiply resources
humans need to find new sources of materials to sustain the growing economy
since humans have discovered ignorance they have acknowledged that there is still so much to explore on this planet
there is no need to fear resource scarcity because every day brings revolutionary inventions
that can create more products and find renewable resources
society's progress and growth are rising very fast and the planet seems to be having a tough time keeping up with it
global warning mass extinctions and severe pollution are happening right now
humans try to ignore the planet's stress signals by building envelopes that give them the comforts they need
such as air conditioning and controlled environments
humans have gone through many economic and ecological problems
but it is always the poor people that suffer the most during an economic crisis
or problems with the environment
there have been countless conventions and arguments
about protecting the environment from the pollution brought about by the various industries worldwide
and yet there is little actual implementation by the concerned parties
it seems humans are putting their faith in the hands of modern science
they continuously burden the environment while thinking that the planet can heal itself
scientists will find revolutionary ways to sustain mankind
or space explorers will soon find another planet for humans to transfer to
people are more concerned about their businesses and profits
although protecting the earth is supposed to be the top priority
Chapter 7 The Humanist Revolution
Modern day humans are more powerful than ever
those who continue to wreak havoc in the world are the people who want to force their religion upon others
it is more violent in syria where there are a lot of muslim rebels than in netherlands where many people are atheists
religion has been used by man to create order and control over mass societies
it tries to attract people by saying that human lives have a greater meaning in this vast universe
it also makes humans believe that there is a supreme authority governing over their daily lives
recently humans have started taking matters into their own hands
they do not wait for their gods to give signs or instructions
they go ahead and do what they feel they need to do in order to survive
one example is the act of marriage between two people
before marriage was seen as a sacred bond
because it was god who joined those two people
whereas now marriage is sacred because of the love those two people felt for each other
humanism has become more prevalent than even religions use them for their own gains
they appeal to the emotions of people rather than pointing out the laws created by god
human feelings and free will are the ultimate authority in justifying human actions
beautiful works of art and music are not any more considered to come from divine inspiration
rather from the genius of man and the emotions of man during the time of creation or composition
the economy is greatly affected by humanism because it relies on what the customers want to pay for
it cannot simply produce something and force the people to buy it
people have to want or need things first
it is based on these needs that a product is crafted and sold afterward
if there is no demand there is no need to produce supplies
one example is the genetically modified chicken with more meat
this product is needed by humans
because if chickens were not modified they would remain small
and it would not be enough to feed the growing population of the world
scientists have therefore invented ways to enhance poultry and make it produce more meat
bigger and meatier chicken cuts are preferred by the buying public
because it sustains them better than the normal sized chickens
humanism also teaches individuals that they are their own boss
heaven is no longer a place high above the clouds
but rather a mental state that one can experience internally through actions and achievements
humanists follow their inner voice instead of consulting and praying for their actions to a god
humanists have discovered a new method of gaining knowledge and authority by means of collecting data and making computations
holy scriptures are no longer the sole basis for obtaining wisdom
the use of the scientific formula has led to many breakthroughs in technological advancements
even ethical problems could be solved by taking the scientific approach
by gathering subjective experiences emotions and thoughts
human morality is improved
a variety of interactions with people and situations teach an individual what is ethically accepted actions and what are immoral acts
humanism is also depicted in many fictional works to make them easily relatable and understandable
the wizard of oz is a fitting example showing different characters searching for strengths they thought they didn't have
the tin man searching for a heart the scarecrow searching for a brain the lion searching for courage during their journey to the land of oz
they soon discovered that what they searched for was already within them human culture has produced wiser and better individuals who now know how to take into account the emotions and opinions of his fellow men rather than blindly follow his god's commands
part three homo sapiens loses control chapter eight the time bomb in the laboratory
liberty is valued by man because of his belief in free will
however free will ceases to exist under the scientific explanation that our actions are not born of free will but rather a result of the electrochemical processes in our brains
free will is another one of those inexplicable and intangible concepts like the soul it is also refuted by the theory of evolution natural selection makes humans what they are regardless of what they want to be
though humans can act freely they cannot control their desires which are the root of their actions people feel first before they think this is based on a study done on a person subjected to a brain scan
even before neurons were fired in the brain the scans showed a biochemical reaction or secretions of hormones that trigger brain activity scientists have also discovered the technology of implanting chips in a rat's brain that can be used to manipulate the movements of the rat
the rat the chip is connected to a remote control that is used to make the rat move left or right moreover it also has a reward function a button for producing pleasurable sensations for the rat when it has moved according to the orders given to it
thus the rat continues to move left or right as dictated by the controller because it is constantly rewarded with feelings of nirvana
the above experiment shows that humans too may be controlled by technology nowadays a brain implant is used to temporarily paralyze the part of the brain that produces feelings of depression
this medical treatment is also used under exceptional circumstances there is also the invention of a helmet that is fitted with electrodes which regulate and calm down brain activities
soldiers use this so they are more composed and precise on the battlefield the brain is one of the best examples that negates the existence of free will
the brain the brain is divided into two hemispheres the left and right some patients who have had a stroke in for example the left side of the brain tend to focus only on the things they can do on the left side
they comb only the left side of the hair or eat the things on the left side of the plate there are also instances when the left hemisphere is not communicating properly with the right hemisphere
the left side of the body would do something totally different from the right the brain can therefore be manipulated since it can be given different experiences it is even done by the human body discreetly a good example of which is childbirth among women
even if the experience is very traumatic and bordering to death at the end of childbirth the body automatically releases hormones that make her feel great this gradually decreases the feelings of trauma and the woman is able to recover from it
there is no free will in doing this just an automatic response of the body after it experiences trauma this cannot be dictated by the person nor can the person control the number of hormones produced by her body
harari also explains here the narrating self and the experiencing self of man while the narrating self can say something the experiencing self may have actions contrary to what was said for example the narrating self says that it will go to the gym regularly this may happen for a few days the experiencing self then moves in and upon finding the experience
not so likable prefers to just sit and watch tv instead of going back to the gym the narrating self is therefore full of liberal beliefs about himself he tries to give meaning to his life through the stories he tells himself
this belief translates that man's life has a higher purpose and deeper meaning in this universe the stories we tell ourselves may sometimes lead to harming ourselves or other people
wars are often the cause of many senseless deaths people often fight for their beliefs regardless of the cost which is usually death and suffering it is mere stupidity to sacrifice things of value for a cause that is only invented by man
the same stupidity is seen in business ventures where corporations keep on shelling out money just to see the realization of a certain long overdue project even if the actual cost turned out higher than the initial budget businessmen would say that it is better to have finished the project after investing so much in it
this excuses them from their failure to have good foresight and evaluation it makes them believe that their investment was worth it
chapter nine the great decoupling there is a continuous effort to replace men with robots strangely man is doing this to his own race soon corporations will cease the employment of manual labor because machines have dominated production the future also foresees the rise of superhuman beings brought about by the innovations in health sciences
these superhumans these superhumans will be regarded as the most valuable types of humans although regular humans will still have some value these threats are very likely to happen in the future robots and drones will soon replace foot soldiers
humans may still be of use as shields for advanced armaments wars will be waged through cyber technology this will last no more than a few seconds to a few minutes
with a single computer key a cyber war can be won with viruses or deletion of millions of valuable records which is more important intelligence or consciousness human drivers can cause traffic accidents while automated cars and network traffic signals can eradicate traffic problems plane tickets could be bought online instead of transacting with airline ticketing agencies
can point out the culprit in a few minutes everything can be done through programmed algorithms
everything can be done through programmed algorithms what will conscious humans do now that technology is slowly taking over many processes and forms of work scientists and experts say there are still so many things humans can do that computers can never do and
computers can never do art sports and archaeology are just some preoccupations that may be hard for algorithms to replace computers and tests done nowadays can also predict the future of your health this is exemplified strongly by actress and UN ambassador Angelita Jolie who got herself tested for breast cancer tests showed that she carried the gene
cancer knowing this information she immediately scheduled for a double mastectomy she did not meditate or try to listen to her heart she let the numbers speak for themselves and did something about the situation to prevent future possibilities of breast cancer computer programs can even pick up habits and patterns and make accurate predictions out of these
ways ways is another computer application that helps drivers navigate around traffic routes another software under development is Microsoft's Cortana it strives to be a personal assistant who not only reminds you of meetings but of your blood pressure if it gets too high or your dopamine levels among other vital statistics this all-knowing network is becoming a massive
and more and more upon it algorithms will become more empowered as computers control the lives of humans privacy and individuality are already becoming obsolete as people share
in artificial intelligence programs just like in medical advancements the latest in genetic coding or extending of life are treatments only available to the elites even Angelina Jolie's genetic testing cost three thousand dollars something that the lower class and the middle class may never afford their entire lives even if they worked over time during the age of the masses medical services are very affordable because the government
government and business corporations want to keep the population healthy and fit to work however with the advancement of computers machines and artificial intelligence it is not certain whether poor people will still be needed in the workforce
chapter 10 the ocean of consciousness
chapter 10 the ocean of consciousness mankind still longs for the age-old rewards of happiness peace and prosperity while the elite are using these prizes as business opportunities Harari mentions two kinds of new religion that will be formed out of these conquests one techno-humanism and two data religion
techno-humanism techno-humanism discusses how the brain will be able to experience other mental states and experiences that are unbeknownst to it before animals for example have unusual ways of experiencing the world bats use electrocution to navigate and feed and whales can hear one another from vast distances these example experiences lead humans to upgrade the current mental state that it knows
humans humans humans had super sensory abilities once upon a time hunters could smell game from vast distances too and their eyesight was keen for spotting and targeting their prey the senses turned dull over time especially in these modern times man pays less attention now and constantly finds ways to
preoccupy his senses through games exciting new food new travels and other temporary highs however man is never satisfied and always craves for something else and something more in a world filled with a myriad of options this is not impossible there is always more to life humans
humans preoccupy themselves with many forms of distractions because meditating and hearing their own voice can bring a lot of unpleasant and inconvenient truths although listening to oneself is humanism's first and foremost rule no matter the difficulty one should always listen to his guts or inner voice and follow it overwhelming any challenges that may get in the way
man's desires are often met with some obstacle which makes obtaining the desire a difficult and uncomfortable task technology tries to eradicate any feelings of uncomfortableness the wearing of the helmet that keeps a person focused and calm or the brain microchip that could control decisions are some of the solutions that technology offers
so we would never have to feel discomfort however human will and experience still trumps technology humans still want to have authority over their actions
chapter 11 the data religion
human desires and experiences can still be replaced by information data is seen to be the god of the modern era data about human desires and experiences can be gathered and made into algorithms that can lead to the ability to control human decisions for example the price of bread is determined by several factors from the source
of raw materials to production and packaging shipping and marketing in a capitalist market market forces determine the supply and price of certain goods producers can make a lot of bread or charge unreasonable prices consumers on the other hand can choose to buy the product or not in a capitalist market practically anyone can join there is a lot of competition and that is why prices are
also usually competitive to gain the most consumers in a communist market however production and prices of goods are monopolized by a single body of authority there is hardly any competition so the price of a commodity can be steep and people will have no choice but to buy it because there is only one source that provides the particular product in a communist economy there is also
a single data processing system governments favor this because they can impose higher taxes on people production is also based only on what is needed therefore there is less wastage and surplus products in the same way that economies have capitalists and communists governments also come largely in the form of dictatorship or democracy
while communism prefers centralized processing however politics has been overtaken by the process of technology the internet has given way to a lawless zone they can pose security risks it still lacks many regulations and security measures the government has been reduced to mere administration instead of leading the country to more certain futures
that are leading the world now mankind is deemed to be an entire system of processors the more processors the faster the job will be done the individuals that make up the system each have their own diversity and may therefore present diverse ways of processing data
data processing systems to fuel the information that goes into the internet of all things data ism is born out of the need for gathering and maximizing data flow it also seeks to make more and more connections akin to missionaries of religious groups the comprehensive collection of data can now enable cars to communicate with
with each other provide a monitor for the inventory of goods provide weather reports and other such information that can be utilized by man freedom of information is rallied in the world today especially on the internet where there are so many stores of knowledge free data can cause numerous benefits to society for example free data can educate more people the same can be said for transportation if
people provided data at the crucial times they need transportation carpools can be programmed to pick up individuals at certain times this will reduce the need for private cars and consequently reduce the need for more infrastructure nowadays people don't notice it but they are subscribing to a religion of data ism man is constantly feeding information into the internet recording every action on
a daily basis most people can't stand a day without connecting to the internet and feeding it or feeding on it the internet is constantly inviting more and more believers to record their whole lives on it and to check every so often the analytics of their accounts when a person's post is liked on facebook it gives meaning to the person's existence it makes him relevant he is no longer just
a single worthless chip there is no certainty that data ism will be the dominant religion no one can accurately predict the future because every second there is a new spark that keeps on changing the course of mankind's future there is a wide spectrum of options and humans are just encouraged to broaden their horizons so that they can map
out a more certain future based on the present and with the guidance and wisdom from the past
conclusion
humans have shaped the planet in a revolutionary way starting out as homo sapiens with basic needs
the humans are now on their way to greater feats in science and technology humanity has so far been able to overcome famine plague and war though remnants still present themselves in modern day societies man is supposed to be free from the miseries of life but the quest for more meaning in life leads to new miseries since man has proven that he can achieve remarkable things
things he is now more confident that he can be like gods who can control his life and his environment
harari also points out the disparity between the rich and poor and how only the rich will be able to enjoy the benefits of modern day technology and machine
immortality may well be on its way to reality with the continued efforts of scientists and their financiers man has always wanted to overcome death because of the promises of immortality written in religious books some people hold on to these beliefs strongly because of the way the stories were crafted in books such as the bible but science has so far been able to dispute many of these religious beliefs the war between science and the
science and religion has long begun has long begun with science taking leaps and bounds after its chains have been removed from the time of enlightenment religion on the other hand has stuck with its beliefs from the past thousand years and has not progressed since however with the dawn of the modern covenant more people can explore the world extensively funds are now made more available to people who wish to conduct researches in
investments are bravely made in the name of progress growth and latest information with humans taking control of their lives the revolution to self-governance is underway humans no longer need gods because he has seen his own capacity for change and growth however with humans getting too confident in his capacity he may not realize the extent to which his actions can already be harmful to others
new innovations may give way to easier lifestyles but these could also cause the ruin of man what was once intended to help man may also be the cause of his downfall it has often been said that tinkering with the natural laws can lead to disastrous ends not everyone though can enjoy
the innovation of merging one's organic being with machines and essentially becoming a superhuman being this privilege is reserved for the financially rich and educated people data production and processing have become so fast that is already difficult to stop it or keep up with it in an effective way information is free and readily accessible to those who seek it humans sit on lofty
lofty heights of scientific innovations but data processing systems can be unstable at times too as such heavy reliance is not advised humans need to be more imaginative and critical about the future they really want to have do we really want
intellect over consciousness or would we rather have machines that think for us instead of exercising our own authority and judgments
instead of exercising our own authority and judgments
