Summary of The War of Art by Stephen Pressfield
Written by Project Inspiration
Narrated by Scott Clem
Introduction
Remember that dream you once had about being a famous painter, writer, or actor?
What has stopped you from being the next Shakespeare?
The answer to that can be found in Pressfield's book, The War of Art.
While some may take it for a self-help book, The War of Art is much more than that.
The book guides you to a path of self-understanding,
which will lead you to recognize what is holding you back.
The concept which is at the core of The War of Art is what the author calls resistance.
While from the name itself, it may be assumed that this pulling force occurs only with creative endeavors
such as music, writing, acting, etc.,
the very core of resistance is rather common
and affects all of us in countless aspects of our lives.
What Pressfield is really saying is,
we are all meant to achieve something great,
but resistance prevents us from getting to our goals and aspirations.
For example, remember the cartoons we watched as kids,
and the two characters that appear sitting on a kid's shoulders?
The good character always says,
You can do it. Go for it.
And then the kid hears the bad character whispering in his ear,
Who are you kidding? You are not good enough.
Everyone will laugh at you.
Although the persuasive powers of resistance have an immense power,
it really is only our personal choice to actually listen and give in.
In the second part of the book,
the author writes about himself as a full-time writer.
Obviously, writers experience tremendous amounts of resistance.
However, Pressfield notes that the everyday struggle against resistance
causes the real satisfaction in life.
When we push past this daily resistance,
that is when our dreams can actually come true.
The final chapter could be called
The Spiritual Side of the War of Art.
This part of the book delves into the spiritual realm of art.
Pressfield takes us deep beneath the surface
and introduces the reader to the concepts of muses and angels.
These spiritual forces are what inspire,
and ultimately help,
every artist overcome the obstacles of the art process.
Pressfield states that once you truly become a professional in any field,
and you dedicate yourself entirely to your work,
that is when inspiration and creativity,
and thereby true art, happen.
Chapter 1. Get Introduced to Resistance
Most of us have two lives,
the life we live,
and the unlived life within us,
the two types of resistance.
Yes, most of us have two lives,
the one we have to live,
and the one that appears to be more exciting and enriching.
Pressfield defines these lives as reality and unlived life.
We have all known people who get easily interested in something,
and then they immediately start creating plans about how they can succeed.
They think they will be the next millionaire,
the next famous actor,
or artist.
Yet, with all their enthusiasm,
they never accomplish their desires.
Why?
Because they give up on this idea as quickly as they get enthusiastic about it.
What stops them from pursuing their dreams?
And more importantly,
what stops you?
Pressfield tries to help answer this question by describing how the Romans explained one's inner calling.
Basically, it's rare for anyone to truly live out what we want.
If you ask random people what their dreams are,
most likely, a significant amount of people would not say they dream of working in an office,
doing monotonous tasks for nine hours a day.
Pressfield uses the watchmaker analogy to tie this concept in,
which implies that we are all cogs in a machine, i.e. society.
But, what if you were screwed into the wrong place?
Your inner calling is the part that you have to play.
Your inner calling is what you hear and feel inside.
For all intents and purposes,
our inner calling is the screw we need to fit into this machine,
so we can have equilibrium with society and ourselves.
Pressfield states that resistance is what truly stops us from achieving our unlived lives.
Resistance is everywhere, all the time.
For instance, you can notice resistance creeping in
when you want to break away from something old,
whatever it may be,
because you feel there may not be something better for you out there.
Whenever you catch yourself procrastinating,
hesitating,
or feeling that there's a wall which separates you from your unlived life,
you should know that it is resistance that is stopping you.
There is no need to feel down,
because everyone experiences resistance,
but the key to success is to fight it.
Pressfield gives the example of Henry Fonda,
an actor and entertainer,
who would throw up before every performance.
Instead of running away,
Henry Fonda acknowledges his anxious resistance,
yet, unlike most people,
he chose not to cave into it.
In Pressfield's mind,
Henry Fonda's success came from pushing through this pain barrier,
where most people would have quit.
Various factors that affect our lives,
such as unhappiness,
criticism,
support,
fear,
etc.,
can also be related to resistance.
Pressfield describes how important it is
to recognize resistance's many manifestations.
Procrastination
One of the most common forms of resistance is procrastination.
This is the little voice in your head that tells you that your project can wait until later,
but deep down you know you are really only telling yourself that you will never get that project done.
When you think about it,
what you are really doing is self-sabotaging your road to success.
Self-Dramatization and Victimhood
The author points out that self-dramatization is another way of creating distractions that can keep people from producing creative work.
Pressfield believes this stems from victimhood,
a passive-aggressive form of avoiding the work that needs to be done,
and an excuse many people use for not accomplishing their goals.
Self-Medication
This refers to taking any substances that control, calm, or distract your mind.
For instance, alcohol, various medications, drugs that are often used to treat stress, anxiety, and unhappiness.
For these reasons, self-medication does not allow a person to truly face resistance.
Criticism and Self-Doubt
You may discover that resistance may appear in the form of criticism and self-doubt as well.
Thus, the author says,
The critic hates most that which he would have done himself if he had had the guts.
In other words, don't take criticism personally,
and whenever someone criticizes you or your work,
you should know that they are probably doing this out of their own inner resistance.
Sex
Sex may be a distraction to getting down to work.
Of course, this refers only to the obsessive preoccupation with sex,
as well as sexual encounters that leave you with a feeling of emptiness or unhappiness.
Unhappiness
Pressfield believes once you become unhappy, you'll oftentimes get bored and lifeless,
which will lead to a slow demise of your aspirations and dreams.
Pressfield also points out that this distraction is really difficult to overcome
because our society is based on an instant gratification model,
which leans toward the individual using consumerism to create instant and momentary happiness.
True happiness comes with effort and time,
and is accomplished at least in part by reaching our goals.
For this reason, we should avoid momentary consumer thrills.
Support
For Pressfield, searching for support to get your job done is a way of admitting that you are not capable of completing the work on your own.
Pressfield tells the readers to remember that the more energy you waste on trying to gather support from others,
the less energy you'll have for dealing with your work.
Characteristics of Resistance
Pressfield notes that resistance is most powerful at the finish line.
To illustrate this, he describes a short episode from The Odyssey.
Odessus was near the end of his journey whereupon an unfortunate event occurs.
Odessus tells his men not to open a sack he has stored,
and while they don't open it for a long period of time,
eventually curiosity gets to them and the men seize the opportunity when Odessus falls asleep to open the sack.
As soon as Odessus' men open the sack,
a distant and powerful wind blows Odessus' ship back to the start of his voyage.
What Pressfield is trying to illustrate in this literary example is that,
in order to get to the finish line,
we must confront resistance the whole way through,
from the beginning to the end of the process.
Resistance and Love
Pressfield states that resistance is directly proportional to love.
If you're feeling massive resistance,
the good news is,
it means there's tremendous love there too.
If you didn't love the project that is terrifying you,
you wouldn't feel anything.
The opposite of love isn't hatred,
it's indifference.
What Pressfield is demonstrating is that,
if you do feel strong resistance towards something,
it means you are driven to accomplish this work because you actually enjoy it.
Another simple point he is expressing is that,
basically, the less you want to do something,
the more important it actually is to do it.
You Don't Need Time to Heal
Sometimes there comes a point when we think that we should give ourselves some time to heal or rest
so that we can get back to work.
This is another form that resistance can take on.
The author describes an episode from his life while he worked as a cab driver.
After one miserable night shift,
he came home and surprisingly had the energy to still do the dishes.
A pile of clean plates began rising in the drying rack.
To my amazement, I realized I was whistling.
It hit me that I had turned a new corner.
I was okay.
I would be okay from here on.
Sometimes what you really need in order to get to work is not rest,
but to keep working.
Working through times you don't feel energized
is what pushes you to a higher playing field in any given field.
Also, if the work is satisfying enough,
we can actually see the work as a form of rest itself.
Resistance is universal.
We all experience it.
However, the crucial thing is that we can beat it,
and the proof is all the countless numbers of people
who created amazing expressions of their art throughout every epoch of history.
The first real step in battling resistance is knowing your enemy,
so it's important to know how to easily identify what your resistance is.
After learning how to identify resistance,
it becomes easier to create strategies to beat resistance,
which will be introduced in the later part of the book.
Chapter 2
Steps to Turning Pro
There is no mystery to turning pro.
It is a decision brought about by an active will.
We make up our mind to view ourselves as pros,
and we do it.
Simple as that.
As the author himself says,
there is no magic pill that will ward off resistance.
Instead, we need to rely on our will to pursue our dreams.
Pressfield mentions one more important thing,
the concept of being a pro or professional.
What exactly is a true pro?
When we think of professionals,
those who first come to mind are probably doctors, lawyers, and businessmen.
However, the meaning the author gives to this word is different.
It is an ideal rather than a set, tangible occupation.
Pressfield says,
the one who is committed to his game full-time,
and who is ready to dedicate his life and time to the craft,
is a professional.
Now, think about it yourself.
Do you see your career as something you will dedicate your life to?
Are you willing to go all in and work your hardest to reach mastery in your trade?
In order to be a real pro,
Pressfield implicitly states that these are important questions to ask ourselves.
While it may seem hard to believe,
in Pressfield's mind,
we are already pros at what we are doing right now.
In other words,
we all possess inerrant qualities to allow us to succeed
that just need to be channeled to our artistic calling as well.
Obviously, turning pro holds the key to fighting resistance.
But what are the steps to becoming a pro?
Accept resistance.
In deciding to be an artist,
one needs to accept that one will always be faced with self-doubt and frustration.
The key thing here is to learn how to numb yourself to these feelings.
Once you recognize it as something that you will inevitably have to live with,
you will efficiently diminish resistance's power of paralyzing you.
So, to fight it,
you have to feel it and,
most importantly,
face it.
Pressfield tries to describe the thinking process of a professional
compared with the mindset of an amateur.
Pressfield lists the differences,
the most important being that pros dedicate themselves fully to their tasks
and target goals,
whereas amateurs are weekend warriors.
Pressfield describes a pro as having the following characteristics.
Patient with his work.
Works hard every day.
Keeps to his schedule and routine.
Organizes his place because he recognizes that his environment reflects the state of his mind.
Makes no excuses.
Doesn't wait for inspiration to get work done.
Work on your creativity.
Creativity is not something that simply happens.
You have to treat it like your job
and dedicate every single day to it in order to master it.
What Pressfield wants to point out
is that you should make the creative process part of your routine.
Of course,
this doesn't mean that you will make something amazing every day,
but you will consciously work on it,
analyze your work,
and improve your technique.
The nature of the artistic process
is that there will always be harder days
when nothing makes sense
and easier days
where everything magically fits together.
A professional does not take success or failure personally.
Let's face it.
Failure is simply an integral part of our lives.
As an artist,
you will have to accept failure as a part of your routine.
Instead of fearing it,
you should acknowledge and use it as a tool to push you past your comfort zone.
Look at failures as lessons that are there to teach you what works and what doesn't.
By doing so,
you can change your approach to your art.
It's also important to develop a thick skin towards failures
and see them as small roadblocks to the life you want.
Play for the love of the game
Building upon the Bagpock Gita's famous quote,
Pressfield says that we should keep working without worrying about the results.
Instead of focusing on the outcome,
the artist should focus on the process.
So, play for the love of the game.
Make art for the love of art.
Investing yourself fully will make you satisfied with your work,
no matter what the end results are.
In essence,
you need to be so much in love with the game
that you are ready to dedicate your life to it.
You are in charge.
As a pro,
you are the one who validates yourself.
You know that there will be people who will either love or dislike your work.
However,
in the end,
regardless of these people,
you are the one who decides if you are satisfied with your work or not.
Also,
no matter whether you are at the beginning of your career
or you are already a successful artist,
you need to be constantly pushing towards perfection.
Be aware that you are the only one who is in charge of your choices.
If there is anything you don't like,
that's good,
because you can decide to change it.
Whatever it is,
writing a book,
creating a painting,
setting up your business plan,
Another important message Pressfield wants us to keep in mind
is that a pro realizes his limitations.
For example,
at the beginning of their careers,
most artists fail to understand
that they simply can't be good at everything.
Instead,
they need help from other professionals
who will support them in their objectives.
One important concept that the author introduces
is that of U.Inc.
Basically,
this means that you should consider yourself
as a corporation,
rather than an individual.
This serves to change your mindset,
so you will start thinking in terms of being productive
with your time and effort to meet an end goal.
In other words,
you will become more professional
and thereby increase your chance of success in your field.
Living Fully
Unfortunately,
a large percentage of people
confuse transient things with happiness,
shiny cars,
expensive clothes,
and exotic travels
all sound great,
but they actually don't contribute
to long-term happiness.
What brings lifelong fulfillment
are the ordinary things
that many of us don't glamorize.
These are our health,
emotions,
and the social connections
we develop with other people,
as well as our purpose
and sense of meaning
we give to our lives.
And lastly,
it is our work
and the sense of satisfaction
we feel after completing our daily tasks
that brings a deep sense of joy.
All these eventually make a difference
between living empty
and living fully in one's life.
Whatever you can do,
or dream you can,
begin it.
Pressfield says,
Nothing else matters
except sitting down every day and trying.
Why is this so important?
Because when we sit down day after day
and keep grinding,
something mysterious starts to happen.
The process is set into motion
by which,
inevitably and infallibly,
heaven comes to our aid.
Unperseen forces enlist in our cause.
Serendipity reinforces our purpose.
The author keeps reminding us
of the powerful forces
that come to our aid
when we decide to really dedicate ourselves
to our craft.
Throughout the book,
Pressfield points out
the negative force of resistance,
but he also introduces
an equally powerful positive force
that he calls muses.
Muses are there to inspire creativity
and help the artist
take his work to the next level.
Pressfield says
that we should appreciate
the feeling we experience
once we finish something
we have worked really hard on.
He explains that
once he finally finished his manuscript,
he felt like a dragon
he's been fighting all his life
had just dropped dead at his feet.
Get Organized
Once you begin working,
you need to keep yourself going.
To do that,
it is important to focus
on organizing your ideas and thoughts.
Here,
you don't have to think about the outcome
when you set your goals.
The author points out
that there is a duality
between organization and chaos.
The principle of organization
is built into nature.
Chaos itself is self-organizing.
Out of primordial disorder,
stars find their orbits,
rivers make their ways to the sea.
When we, like God,
set out to create a universe,
a book,
an opera,
a new business venture,
the same principle kicks in.
Once the artist gets down to his work,
he will inevitably run into resistance.
To suppress its power,
the artist develops the habit of consistency.
This refers to the discipline
of getting to work every day,
no matter what.
The artist understands
that inspiration doesn't strike.
Instead,
he makes it strike.
Also,
the artist understands
that resistance doesn't go anywhere.
It is there to stay,
but he will learn to tame it
by sheer discipline,
focus on his work,
and organized effort.
Chapter 3
What's Beyond the Surface?
Ah, but when we begin,
when we make a start,
when we conceive an enterprise
and commit to it
in the face of our fears,
something wonderful happens.
A crack appears in the membrane.
Pressfield tells us
that every time he starts working,
he says a prayer to the muse.
He experiences asking
this invisible force for help
as something magical
that helps him leave behind
arrogance and pride.
The author also mentions angels,
who are similar to muses,
and whose messages
we often fail to hear
as we are too distracted
by resistance.
However,
once we start working,
they all gather around us
to help.
The author mentions
nine muses
that we are familiar with
from Greek mythology.
Pressfield borrows this concept
to refer to the artist's
unconscious talent
and innate qualities
that bring about
astonishing art.
Pressfield develops the idea
that art actually exists
in the sphere of time
even before it is embodied
in an object
that is perceived
by us humans.
In other words,
that the work of art
is already present,
but only as potential art.
So,
the muses are there
to inspire the artist
and help him create
and fulfill that potential.
Again,
Pressfield points out
the magic of making a start.
Namely,
the muses come at the moment
when you unleash
the creativity
that resides deep within.
Even after the work
is near completion,
you need to keep going,
keep revising,
and amending
your work of art.
To explain this,
Pressfield describes
an episode from his life,
detailing a walk
he had in the woods
after he had completed
his daily work.
Although his body
was taking a rest
during this walk,
his mind was still working,
thinking,
analyzing,
and restructuring
the work.
This analyzing process
is not intentional,
but ingrained,
and he described it
as his inner muse
giving him suggestions.
The closing chapter
of Pressfield's
War of Art
is characterized
by his view
on ego and self.
Namely,
he differentiates
these two psyches
of the mind
by the shifts
and turns they take,
and their internal role
in everyday activities,
as well as their impact
on our holistic sense
of well-being.
He claims that
we will be able
to fully live our lives
once we separate
the ego from the self.
Hierarchies and Territories
In the animal kingdom,
animals are defined
first by how they rank
within a hierarchy,
and second,
by their connection
to a territory.
Hierarchies and territories
are important
for us humans as well,
primarily because
they provide us
with psychological security
as they serve
to maintain organization
and order.
While they both
help us understand
our role and place
in the world,
there is a sharp distinction
between these two concepts.
An individual
who defines himself
by his place
in a hierarchy
competes with all
the other members
of the order,
so he will try
to defend his place
against those
who are below him
but will at the same time
seek to climb up
by advancing
those above him.
How he behaves
towards others
will reflect his rank
in the hierarchy.
Evaluates how
his happiness
and success
will become intrinsically
linked by his rank
within the hierarchy.
Thus,
he will only be satisfied
when he is at the top.
Most of us
naturally tend to lean
towards the hierarchy paradigm
because it is the model
we have followed
since childhood.
As we grow up,
most of us allow
the hierarchy
to remain in place
but in a different,
more complex facet.
What we tend to do
is allow these hierarchies
to set borders
and decide on the choice
we make in life.
For example,
we are misled
to believe in climbing
the corporate hierarchy
is the only way
we can increase
our income
and social standing.
The fact is,
hierarchies are ineffective
for those individuals
who pursue something different,
greater,
and more meaningful in life.
Thus,
the author claims
that for the artist
to define himself
hierarchically
is fatal.
Since the artist
has to create art
for the love of art,
he has to be territorial
and not hierarchical.
In other words,
the artist needs
to define his territory
of work
and strive
to excel at it.
To check your orientation,
ask yourself
what you would do
if you were
the last person
on the planet.
You will know
that you have defined
your territory
if your answer
reflects the same calling
as your true calling.
Claiming Your Territory
When you think
territorially,
you do work
for its own sake.
Again,
you play the game
for the love of it,
and if you end up
being paid large sums
of money for it,
then it's just
a by-product
of the love you have
for your work.
The author also relates
it to the environment
you feel most comfortable in.
He gives the example
of Stevie Wonder,
whose territory
is the piano.
Pressfield describes
several characteristics
of a territory.
A territory sustains us
without any external output.
What you get
from the territory
is foremost for yourself.
For example,
Pressfield says
that Stevie Wonder's
territory is the piano,
but only through hard work
can someone reach
the level of success
and mastery
that Stevie Wonder has.
In simple terms,
what you put
into your territory
is what you get back.
If you have figured out
what your territory is,
then claim it.
You have to work
on your territory daily,
for long periods of time,
before you can master it.
Finally,
Pressfield ends
by stating that
you should treat
your true calling
as your absolute obligation.
When you decide
to follow your inner calling,
you do a world of good
not only to yourself,
but to the rest of the world
as well,
because you will give them
the next work of art.
This work of art,
however small,
will change the world
in a meaningful way.
The war of art
is not an easy road
to walk on.
However,
it is the only true path
to fulfillment,
contentment,
and happiness.
