Welcome, in our last lecture we offered a very broad survey of religious themes in African
history including the spread of Islam and Christianity.
For a very long time, well over a thousand years, in fact, there was really only one
place in Africa where Christianity could be called the dominant religion, Ethiopia.
In this lecture we examine the unique history of Ethiopia over the long haul, and indeed
this is one of those times in the course where I will stay with a subject for the sake of
continuity, in this case I'm going to carry it forward up to the present.
I must say off the bat that Ethiopia is one of those places in Africa which seems to exert
a very magnetic pull on many outsiders.
I don't think I've ever met an American Ethiopianist who didn't consider it sort of the natural
course of things that one would choose to exert your energy in studying this place.
They look at you as if you're a little bit crazy to consider anything else.
Much of Ethiopia is high and mountainous country.
It is associated with the great rift that we talked about in the second and third lectures,
the tectonic plate movement which is responsible for the Red Sea, the Great Lakes of East Africa,
and so forth.
The volcanic and therefore rather fertile nature of the soils in Ethiopia has meant that for
a very long time indeed, because Ethiopia certainly has one of the longest histories of agriculture
anywhere in the world.
For a very long time indeed, it has sustained and supported quite high population density.
Even in the late 20th, 21st century when we have heard on a number of occasions of devastating
droughts and famine indeed in Ethiopia, its population density remains among the highest in Africa.
Now, in the first centuries AD, a kingdom emerged in the area, the region we call Ethiopia.
Its original name was Axum.
The basis of the kingdom's wealth was agricultural, as we might expect, but its external trade was
largely in ivory, a theme that we'll encounter on a number of occasions in the next couple
of lectures.
In this case, the principal entrepot for trade between the interior, the Axumite kingdom,
and the outside world was the Red Sea port of Adullis.
The people's language here was Ge'ez, the basis of modern Amharic.
And they had already, in these first few centuries of the modern era, developed their own quite
unique literary script.
And it is indeed unique.
There are a number of places where one sees script worked into works of art in great tapestries
and so forth, sort of Book of Kells style where the written word will be embroidered and embellished
and become part of the art work, and it's a very striking component of a number of the works of art to
come out of this part of the world.
Amharic, an early literary script out of Africa.
They built already in these centuries tall stone monoliths known as stele to mark the tombs of rulers.
And some of these still stand today.
If you think of Cleopatra's needle in central London, right on the Thames, but of course not originally built there,
taken from Egypt and brought there, that is a very similar style to these monoliths called stele.
Now, we mentioned in our overview in the last lecture that a particular strain of Christianity
developed early on in North Africa, specifically in Egypt, and became the dominant strain there.
This was Coptic Christianity committed, among other things, to a monophysite,
that is a single divine nature of Christ, and became the dominant form of Christianity there,
although of course eventually greatly overshadowed in Egypt by Islam.
Coptic Christians from Alexandria in Egypt arrived in the fourth century AD in Ethiopia,
and in fact they achieved or got their great prize when the early Ethiopian king, or I should say
Aksumite at this point, Aksumite king, converted to Christianity during his reign from 330 to 350 AD.
This is the same king, Izana, by the way, who eventually was responsible for dealing the
the death blow to the old iron production center of Meroe in the Kushite kingdom of Nubia.
Now, by the 8th century or so, the rulers of Aksum, buffeted by Arab-Muslim pressure predominantly from the east,
as well as Persian, had retreated further south, well into the central highlands of modern Ethiopia.
This relatively greater degree of isolation developed a distinctive strain of Coptic Christianity in the Ethiopian church.
It was marked on one hand by a very strong monastic tradition,
and if you've ever get a chance to see the film footage of some of the monks who have established monasteries
high up on these cliff sides or cliff tops and reaching it only by means of a series of rope ladders,
which they then pull up after them,
you definitely do get the impression that these were monks determined to, in a sense, leave the world behind.
Strong monastic tradition on one hand, but on the other, the church hierarchy was very worldly indeed,
and indeed in a quite material sense.
They eventually controlled great wealth and vast domains of Ethiopia's land.
Now, to jump forward a bit, in 1150, the founders of the so-called Zagwe dynasty seized power.
Again, we see a succession of dynasties, not quite as many as we saw in ancient Egypt,
not quite as long, obviously, but nonetheless, a similar kind of dynamic.
Seized power and ushered in an era of aggressive Christian expansion in the region.
In the early 13th century, Christian monks began building a series of churches
out of solid mountain rock, carved out of solid mountain rock.
These churches, and Kevin Shillington's words,
testament to the strength and fervor of the Ethiopian Christian church,
remain among the most astonishing architectural marvels of sub-Saharan Africa.
You know, maybe I shouldn't even qualify that by saying sub-Saharan.
I'm not sure anything can be compared to Egyptian pyramids.
I guess it's a matter of sort of choose your marvel here.
But this was not a case of constructing churches with stone carved or taken from quarries or what have you.
This was taking the monolith itself, the huge part of a mountain, a flattish part of a mountainous region usually,
and essentially sculpting a church out of it, complete with the pillars and seats and altars and so forth.
So, again, it may be closer to sculpture than construction as we normally think of it.
Incredible churches.
Now, in 1270, we have another dynastic change.
And this usher is in the dynasty most famous in Ethiopian history, known as the Salamanid dynasty.
Now, Salamanid obviously is a reference to none other than the legendary King Solomon of the Old Testament in this case.
And I must say, this is where Ethiopia's religious history gets to be very intriguing and interesting indeed.
There came to be, what to call them, legends, myths, stories about the origins of Ethiopia and of the Ethiopian,
yes, of the entire culture and its religious life, which goes something like this.
Long before the birth of Christ, none other than the Queen of Sheba, who does appear in the Bible in a number of cases and is always assigned to Ethiopia.
However, it's important to clarify that in sources like the Bible, Ethiopia was a very generalized term.
It didn't necessarily apply to, you know, what I've called axiom in the process of becoming, you know, the Ethiopian kingdom.
Ethiopia is a very generic term.
And it basically referred to, you know, sort of any part of inner Africa, any part of unquestionably black Africa.
So, you know, the notion that there was a Queen of Sheba from the Ethiopia we're talking about,
or even that there was ever a Queen of Sheba at all, many consider this quite a mythical figure, perhaps open to question.
Back to our story, though.
Queen of Sheba leaves, goes to, you know, ancient Israel, essentially,
meets King Solomon and, you know, boy meets girl at this point.
King meets queen, and in fact, Solomon and Sheba have a child, and they name David.
Now, David eventually, according to this line of founding mythology,
takes the name of Menelik, obviously a much more localized name as opposed to the biblical David,
and is considered sort of, in this retelling of it, the founder of the Ethiopian state.
And in fact, it goes further than this.
The Ark of the Covenant, maybe the most, what, revered artifact of all of the Old Testament,
and probably, you know, created something like 1250 B.C. or something,
you know, a beautiful box, basically, but lined and covered with fine gold,
and originally designed, apparently, to hold the two tablets of the Ten Commandments,
you know, written by the finger of God, and so forth.
The Ark of the Covenant has been missing for a very long time,
and the Ethiopian church's explanation for this is that Menelik, our son of Solomon and Sheba,
actually brought it with him to Ethiopia.
And the monks, the church clergy in Ethiopia, in fact,
very definitely claim to this day that the Ark of the Covenant
is inside a particular one of these Christian churches in Ethiopia.
Now, no one, and I mean no one,
is allowed Ethiopian, African, European, outsider, insider,
to see the Ark of the Covenant.
So, obviously, it's a difficult sort of thing to establish.
Maybe that's not its significance, though.
Replicas of the Ark of the Covenant are, which are called tabot,
T-A-B-O-T, tabot,
are, in fact, placed in every single one of Ethiopia's
20-something thousand Christian churches,
and they're brought out as part of religious processions, etc., etc.
Now, again, with the cold-eyed historian,
it's rather hard to accept this.
After all, Solomon lived in about the 9th century B.C.
The kingdom of Axum certainly has been established
by radiocarbon dating to the early centuries A.D.
Nonetheless, faith, that's what we're getting at here,
and, again, this has not only Christian connotations,
but, in a sense, connotations from the Old Testament as well.
I might mention that, you know,
I've been speaking of a Christian outpost in Africa,
but, in fact, there was a community in Ethiopia
for a very long time,
and there's still some remnants of it,
which was quite self-consciously Jewish.
This was an African Jewish community known as the Falasha.
A great number of them have actually left Ethiopia now.
They came under considerable persecution,
particularly after the fall of Haile Selassie
that we'll come to in the 1970s,
and, actually, a substantial number of them now
have immigrated to, where else?
To Israel, and have been accepted in Israel at this point.
So, there is a smaller, but, nonetheless,
present Jewish tradition here as well.
Now, this new Solomana dynasty,
however grandiose its stories of origins, in fact,
ceased building in stone,
in fact, began a period over a couple of centuries
where the capital was moved rather frequently,
apparently in part because of exhaustion
and natural resources.
Some of the environmental deterioration
in this heavily populated part of Africa
may, indeed, have begun to show its face at this point.
After all, when I mentioned early on
that Ethiopia has become known
for rather tragic kinds of famines and so forth,
the first of the Bob Geldof,
yes, Bob Geldof organized aid concerts and so forth,
which was in 1985,
was specifically stimulated
by excruciating imageries
of famine out of Ethiopia.
So, both feast and famine
are present in the long run of this history.
Now, over the next several centuries,
Ethiopia was often under pressure
from Muslim merchant and military penetration
from the east
and from quite fiercely independent
Aromo pastoralists
along the southern edge
where it gets to be very dry
and semi-desert
of the area we call Ethiopia.
Now, in fact, substantial portions
of what we call Ethiopia
in the modern sense
were occupied
either by Muslim powers like Odal
or these quite independent
pastoralists in the south.
Closer to home,
many regions were under the sway
of local nobility
and the church,
both great landholders,
rather than the central monarchy.
It is for good reason
that Ethiopia
has often been described
as feudal.
In my surveys
of African history,
indeed,
this is the one place
that really seems
to ring a bell
with my understanding
of medieval Europe,
including kind of this
ongoing tension
which you see
in, you know,
practically every European country
between a central monarchy
and a very powerful
local nobility
which is part secular
and part religious.
It's very hauntingly similar
in a lot of ways.
Now, in 1855,
a provincial governor
named Tawadros II,
is actually sort of
Amharic rendering
of Theodore II,
after modernizing
his locally based army,
seized the monarchy
and took that title.
I should say
that's the title
he took after taking
the Ethiopian monarchy.
Now,
Tawadros
was a modernizer
in a number of respects
and he was successful
in tilting this balance
of power
between a localized
provincial nobility,
religious or secular,
and the central monarchy
in his own favor
for a time.
Predictably,
this earned him
the enmity
of those more peripheral
kinds of
powers within
the kingdom.
Now, in 1868,
there occurred
what these days
we would probably call
a diplomatic incident,
which
leads to the
unhappy end
of Tawadros,
but in some respects
also points us forward
not only in Ethiopia's case,
but in some of the themes
of this course.
There was a British
trade consul.
Again,
far from a colonial ruler
at this point,
but, you know,
an agent there
basically to promote trade,
which obviously
Britain and the U.S.
and probably Ethiopia
has all over the world
up to this day.
In any case,
for reasons
that don't concern us,
he was arrested
and held
by the government
of Tawadros,
and this led
to a brief
but quite forceful
British invasion
of Ethiopia.
Something like
30,000 troops
were dispatched here.
Again,
Britain really feeling
its oats
in the mid
and late
19th century.
Tawadros resisted,
but he found here
that the bad blood
he had sown
with the localized
nobility
and church leaders
led to,
it came back
to haunt him
because with
their encouragement,
a substantial number
of his soldiers
deserted,
and in fact,
in the ultimate
confrontation
with this British force,
he himself
took his pistol
and committed suicide.
Now,
the British withdrew,
and this is why
I said it points
forward a bit.
The British withdrew,
but we are approaching
an era
in 1868
when most
of Africa
was colonized
by Europeans
during the
so-called
scramble,
and we're going
to pay a great
deal of attention
to that
in our coming
lectures 19
and 20.
Now,
to look at Ethiopia
in the time
of this scramble,
extremely important.
In the late
1880s and 1890s,
Italy moved
to take over
Ethiopia.
Italy,
in a sense,
wanted a piece
of this action,
this magnificent
African cake,
which obviously
Britain by the
1880s and 90s,
France,
Germany,
were so actively
involved
in the colonial
carving up
of Africa,
and Italy
wanted to get in
on this process.
By this time,
the Ethiopian king
was none other
than Menelik II,
taking his name
from the legendary
founder,
who took power
in 1889
and,
like Tawadros,
proved himself
a skillful ruler
and a military
modernizer.
Menelik grudgingly
recognized
the establishment
of an Italian
colony
in the coastal
strip of Eritrea
that I'll come back
to at the end
of our lecture.
That is the
coastal strip
of what used
to be all
of Ethiopia
along the Red
Sea there.
But in 1896,
consider that day,
1896 and consider
what's happening
in the rest
of Africa
in terms
of the colonial
occupation.
At a place
called Ottawa
in today's
Ethiopia,
Menelik II's
forces inflicted
a resounding
defeat on the
Italians
and sent them
packing.
Now,
the significance
of Menelik's
repulsion of the
Italians can hardly
be overstated.
Aside from Liberia
in West Africa,
which was founded
by freed African-American
slaves,
Ethiopia was literally
the only place
in Africa
not colonized
by Europeans
in this period.
So when I use
the word unique
about Ethiopian
history at the
beginning of the
lecture as a
Christian outpost,
it's unique in
other ways as well.
Independent Ethiopia
was an inspiration
to Africans
in Africa
and in the
diaspora.
and indeed
the emperor
through much
of the
20th century
whose name
was Ras
Tafari
but who
later took
the name
of Haile
Selassie
was seen
by many
as a symbol
of African
pride.
And I'll
come back
to Haile
Selassie
in a moment.
Well,
the Europeans,
in fact,
the Italians
eventually returned
with a vengeance.
and it was
none other
than Benito
Mussolini,
the founder
of fascism,
who took
power in
Italy in 1922
but in
1935
was determined
to avenge
his nation's
humiliation
of 1896,
invaded
Ethiopia
and seized
most of his
country.
In exile,
Haile Selassie
went to the
League of Nations
and made a
dramatic plea
to international
leaders to
confront such
aggression.
Their failure
to do so,
they essentially
ignored him,
their failure
to do so
was viewed
by many,
is viewed
still by many,
as a seminal
moment,
a moment,
if you like,
of appeasement
leading to
World War II
and more so,
as you can
readily imagine,
in the eyes
of many Africans
both in Africa
and the diaspora,
a sign of
essentially contempt
for Africa
itself.
Now,
Ethiopia's,
excuse me,
Mussolini's
success,
well,
in a lot of
ways,
it didn't
last terribly
long,
but it
certainly
didn't last
long in
the case
of Ethiopia.
The Allied
forces launched
a major theater
of war in,
well,
several major
theaters of war
in the Second
World War
in Africa,
and one of
them was
definitely the
Ethiopian front.
They succeeded
in expelling
the Italians
relatively early
in the war
in 1941
and somewhat
reluctantly
re-recognized
Haile Selassie
and Ethiopia's
restored independence.
Again,
another word
about Ethiopia's
meaning to
Africans all
over the world,
and specifically
Haile Selassie's.
You know,
I mentioned in
passing last time
so-called Ethiopianist
churches,
that is the
independent churches
created all over
Africa.
I mean,
that's a term you
find for these
independent churches
in Southern
America.
By independent,
I mean independent
of European
control.
Christian,
but we don't
want to be under
that hierarchy
and control.
And the fact
that they took
the name of
Ethiopian churches
was in essence
recognizing that
even though they
were thousands
of miles,
had no actual
link with Ethiopia
whatsoever,
that they were
drawing inspiration
from that.
African Americans
in the United
States organized
a whole movement
to, you know,
the Save Ethiopia
campaigns
when Ethiopia
was under
this pressure
and invasion
from Italy.
And in the
diaspora more
widely,
of course,
I mentioned
Haile Selassie's
original name
of Rastafari.
Well,
of course,
that's the basis
for the,
what,
quasi-religious,
quasi-political
movement.
We think of
Jamaica above all
probably,
but in the West
Indies and elsewhere
known as
Rastafarianism
and they
revere
Haile Selassie
as a political
and religious
symbol.
So famous,
I suppose he's
the most famous
Rastafarian of all
and that's
Bob Marley
actually composed
a song
which Marley
rather curtly
titles
War,
entitled War,
but it's a song
based,
it takes
much of its
lyrics from
a speech
by Haile Selassie,
a very noble
speech in which
Selassie was saying,
I'm just giving you
some of the lyrics
of the song here,
until the philosophy
which holds
one race superior
and another inferior
is finally
and permanently
discredited
and abandoned.
And then
Marley gives you
his chorus
of everywhere
there will be war,
essentially it's a
kind of,
you know,
no justice,
no peace
sort of thing.
Now it's a very
eloquent speech
by Selassie,
a very noble
speech.
Back at home,
however,
things were
not quite so
pretty
in a lot of
respects.
If you look at
Reichard Kapuscinski's
portrait
of the last
days of,
I shouldn't say
the last,
the last years
of Selassie's
reign
in his book
The Emperor,
you get a
portrait of a
man who
certainly is
extremely
intelligent
and extremely
clever and
wily in
playing enemies
off against
one another.
The almost
fantastic parts
of that book
are the
ways in which
Selassie was
able to,
again,
win this sort
of tug of war
between himself
and local
nobility.
And I think
it's fair to say
that in a way
he becomes
kind of the
last of the
absolute monarchs
in the world.
I mean,
some of the
descriptions in
that book
of,
you know,
there's the,
he's not the
minister,
but he's the
keeper of the
pillow.
And Selassie
was quite a
short man.
When he took
his seat on
the throne,
you know,
his feet were
not meant to
dangle for a
second.
And this guy's
job for 26
years,
he was telling
Kapuscinski,
was to slip
that pillow
under there,
you know.
Haile Selassie
then very
much an
autocrat at
best,
a dictator
at worst.
He met
his own
reckoning
finally in
1974 after
something like
a half a
century on
the throne.
Radical
military officers
devout,
well,
very committed
Marxist
officers overthrew
his government
and ended
at last
the Ethiopian
monarchy
after,
again,
something like
1700 years.
They replaced
it with a
military junta
which,
although it
had some
successes
which won
sympathy from
leftists
elsewhere in
adult literacy,
for instance,
was in fact
even more
brutal than
Selassie's.
In the name
of revolution,
it spawned
the seeds
of its own
destruction
and its
leader went
into exile
in Zimbabwe
where he
remains.
Among the
new ruler's
problems were
armed secession
movements in
Tigray and
Eritrea.
And I'm
simply going to
end by note
that Eritrea
eventually organized
a secessionist
movement,
an armed
secessionist
movement,
and was
successful and
established its
own independence
in the
1990s.
of Africa's
modern borders.
After all,
every country
on the map,
it's a true,
was drawn
by outsiders
during the
so-called
scramble for
Africa and
so forth.
This
artificiality,
however,
once colonialism
was passed has
essentially remained
unchallenged.
Ethiopia is the
one and only
case of
official,
legal,
formalized
change in
African borders
since
independence,
despite the fact
that all of those
borders are the
direct legacies
and products
of colonialism.
So Ethiopia
is today
no longer
particularly
unique.
I hope
it's not
cynical to say
that at this
point it is
another African
country struggling
with a lot
of problems.
But what a
history.
Thank you.
