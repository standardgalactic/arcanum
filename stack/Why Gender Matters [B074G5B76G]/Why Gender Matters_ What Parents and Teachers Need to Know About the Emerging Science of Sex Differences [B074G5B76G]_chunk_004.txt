Our first question is, do you think Daniel really is gay, or is it just a phase?
Our second question is, if Daniel is gay, what should we do about it?
Our third question is, how did this happen?
What did we do or not do that might have led to his becoming gay?
Wendy was reading quickly. She was close to tears.
Will he outgrow it?
We went online to research this, but there are so many different websites.
We didn't know which ones we could trust, you know, so we thought we'd start by asking you.
There's no way he's gay, Paul said before I could respond.
I mean, look at the girls he's taken out. He's dated some really good-looking girls.
What about that girl he took out last month? I think her name was Ingrid something?
She was gorgeous.
Ingrid Rasmussen, she's a lovely girl, Wendy added.
Why would a boy who's gay go out on a date with a pretty girl? Paul asked.
Plenty of reasons, I said. Here's one.
Many gay boys who are Daniel's age aren't yet a hundred percent sure that they're really gay.
They're still wondering whether they might be bisexual or even straight.
They may think that if they can find just the right girl, a girl who can get them sexually aroused,
then they'll be straight and everything will be fine.
Daniel and Ingrid only went out that one time, Wendy said.
I asked Danny how it went and he said, fine.
I asked him whether he would ask her out again and he just shrugged his shoulders and said,
maybe, maybe not.
Even if a boy knows he's gay, he may still ask a girl out on dates because he doesn't want other people to know, I continued.
He may even be physically intimate with a girl, even have sex with a girl, to quell any rumors about his sexual orientation.
How can a gay guy have sex with a girl? Paul asked.
Easy, I said. He just imagines that he's having sex with another guy.
That's sick, Paul said.
It's the same way heterosexual men in prison have sex with other men, I said.
They imagine they're having sex with a woman.
Sexual arousal is more about what's going on in your head than what's going on between your thighs.
Paul and Wendy took a moment to ponder this.
Many teenage boys are just not ready to come out as gay, I continued.
Even today, many don't want their sexual orientation to become public knowledge.
At the same time, they're desperate for someone to talk to, someone they can trust.
And like almost all teenage boys, they're experiencing strong sexual feelings.
They're looking for an outlet.
Maybe he's just bisexual, not a hundred percent gay, Wendy said hopefully.
Men who are truly bisexual are uncommon, I said.
Some teenage boys who call themselves bisexual are actually gay,
but they aren't ready to acknowledge their sexual orientation, even to themselves.
Some boys perceive less social stigma to being bi than to being gay.
What about my other question?
Will he outgrow it?
Could it be just a phase?
Wendy asked.
Here's one way to think about homosexuality, I said.
The difference between a gay man and a straight man is something like the difference between a left-handed person and a right-handed person.
Being left-handed isn't just a phase.
A left-handed person won't someday magically turn into a right-handed person.
Some people are in between, Wendy said hopefully.
Some people are ambidextrous.
Some people are in between, I agreed.
And you're saying it's not our fault, Wendy said.
It's not something we did wrong, raising him.
I suppose that's a relief.
But what do we do now?
What about that email?
He's thinking about suicide.
Are we supposed to ignore that?
Of course not, I said.
Your first priority should be to make sure your son knows that you will always love him,
no matter what, gay or straight.
Next, I suggest you contact one of the local support groups for gay teenagers.
I can give you some phone numbers.
Talk with one of their counselors first.
They can give you some guidance about how to proceed,
and they can advise you about how to put Daniel in touch with their people.
I can't believe you seriously want to send our son to some gay clinic, Paul muttered.
He might catch AIDS or something.
I ignored Paul's remark.
Let me give you those phone numbers.
Or, if you're shy about making the phone call, I'll call myself right now while we're all here together.
Right and left versus right and wrong
In the United States today, and indeed around the world,
discussions of homosexuality can easily become politically charged.
It's not hard to see why.
As recently as 2003, homosexual behavior was a criminal offense in 13 states in the United States.
Two adult men could be sent to jail for having a consensual sexual encounter with each other.
As I write this chapter, homosexual sexual contact is illegal in 74 countries around the world.
When I share research on lesbian, gay, bisexual topics,
people on the conservative end of the spectrum sometimes think I am defending homosexuals.
People on the other end of the spectrum sometimes think I am being too timid or too conservative.
I have learned, the hard way, that we have to start at the beginning,
with a discussion of what's normal, what's a normal variation,
what is pathological, and what is morally wrong, and who decides.
These are different categories.
You and I must be certain that we understand each other.
I have found that it's useful to begin the conversation with a discussion not of homosexuality,
but of left-handedness.
One hundred years ago, left-handedness was considered pathological,
an abnormal condition requiring intervention to change the individual from left-handed to right-handed.
The belief that left-handedness was abnormal was not unique to that era.
On the contrary, that belief has been shared by many cultures in many eras,
often with an added connotation linking left-handedness with evil or weakness.
The Latin word for left, sinistra, is also the source of our word sinister.
The old English word luft, from which we get our word left, meant weak or weakness.
The French word gauche means both left and clumsy or inept.
One century ago, it was common for teachers to correct left-handed children,
forcing them to write with their right hand instead of their left.
President Harry Truman recalled being forced to write with his right hand as a child instead of his left.
All that began to change around the middle of the 20th century,
in part due to recognition that left-handedness is common and that left-handedness is innate.
It's now generally recognized that between 7% and 10% of the population is left-handed.
And it's equally well recognized today that left-handedness is innate,
even though left-handedness sometimes is not clearly manifest until early or middle childhood.
As a result, left-handedness has come to be recognized as a normal variation.
It's not as common as right-handedness, but it is within the range of normal.
Let's now contrast left-handedness with familial hypercholesterolemia, FH.
FH is a genetic condition that causes very high cholesterol levels,
even if you only eat healthy foods.
It's not a choice.
Nobody chooses to have FH.
Like left-handedness, FH is innate.
You are born with it or you aren't.
But unlike left-handedness, FH can lead to stroke, heart attack, and early death
unless it is treated aggressively and early with medications to lower cholesterol.
For that reason, FH is considered pathological.
It's not a normal variation.
As a general rule, conditions that require medical intervention are not normal variations.
They are outside the range of normal.
Conversely, conditions that do not require medical intervention are more likely to be normal variations.
The trajectory of homosexuality has closely followed the arc of left-handedness over the previous century.
One century ago, homosexuality was believed to be both rare and pathological.
Throughout the early and middle 20th century, it was common for doctors to recommend
conversion therapy to cure men of homosexuality.
Many of the treatments that were widely employed as late as the mid-20th century are now seen as barbaric.
Consider the case of Alan Turing.
Today, Alan Turing is widely regarded as one of the greatest mathematicians of the past 500 years.
He helped develop the machine that broke the German Enigma code during World War II.
He wrote some of the key early papers on artificial intelligence before modern computers had even been invented.
But his genius was not widely recognized in January 1952, when he was arrested on charges of homosexual behavior,
charges that he did not contest.
He was given a choice between imprisonment and chemical castration,
injections of female hormone intended to eliminate male libido.
He chose the injections.
On June 7, 1954, he died of cyanide poisoning.
His death was ruled a suicide.
Today, most researchers agree that homosexuality is a normal variation,
just as being left-handed is a normal variation.
And the moment I say that, when I'm doing a presentation on this topic,
is when somebody or several people raise their hands to voice their objections.
When I do this presentation, this is the point where somebody will raise their hand or sometimes just interrupt.
Dr. Sachs, homosexuality is morally wrong, one person said.
Who are you, Dr. Sachs, to say that homosexuality is normal or a normal variation?
My answer?
Whether a behavior is morally right or morally wrong is a question that is completely separate
from the question of whether a particular condition is within the range of normal.
A behavior can be normal and still be considered morally wrong.
For example, drinking and enjoying alcohol in moderation is a normal behavior.
But in many cultures and religions, from Islam to Mormonism, it is considered immoral and wrong.
I am not praising or criticizing Islam or Mormonism.
I'm just explaining that a behavior can be perfectly normal while nevertheless being unequivocally wrong in certain belief systems.
It's unproductive for advocates of any particular morality or religion to claim that everything that they consider wrong
is necessarily abnormal, to equate wrong with abnormal as though those two words mean the same thing.
They don't mean the same thing.
Something can be normal from a medical perspective but still be wrong from your perspective.
For example, if you're a Mormon and we're talking about drinking beer.
When I lead my workshop on lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender issues, I ask,
What causes someone to be homosexual rather than heterosexual?
Is it innate or acquired?
And that's when somebody else will raise their hand.
Dr. Sachs, I think your question is offensive, one attendee said.
By asking what causes homosexuality, you are implying that there is something wrong with being homosexual.
But that's not true.
We can reasonably ask, What causes left-handedness?
Without implying that there is something wrong with left-handed people.
Left-handedness is less common than right-handedness,
so it is not inappropriate to ask what causes left-handedness.
Likewise, people who identify as homosexual are less common than people who identify as heterosexual,
so it's perfectly reasonable to ask what causes some people to be homosexual.
To sort out innate factors in homosexuality or left-handedness or any other condition,
it's helpful to do a twin study.
Identical twins share 100% of their DNA.
Fraternal twins share, on average, about 50% of their DNA,
the same as any pair of siblings with the same parents.
If a condition is more commonly shared by identical twins than by fraternal twins,
that's good evidence that the condition is genetically programmed, at least in part.
Dr. J. Michael Bailey and his colleagues at Northwestern University
conducted a large study in which they asked homosexual men who were twins
whether their twin brothers also were homosexual.
Among homosexual men who had an identical twin brother,
52% of the identical twins were also homosexual.
Among homosexual men who had a fraternal twin brother,
only 22% were also homosexual.
And among homosexual men who had an adopted brother,
only 11% were also homosexual.
The high concordance among identical twins provides strong evidence
that homosexuality, at least in men, has a strong genetic component.
It is, to some degree, hardwired.
Subsequently, Professor Bailey and his colleagues conducted a larger twin study
using the Australian National Database of Twins.
This time, they looked not only at gay men but also at lesbian women.
Again, they found substantial concordance among identical twin men.
If one man was homosexual,
there was an increased likelihood that his identical twin was also homosexual.
The concordance was lower for men who were fraternal twins rather than identical twins.
But for women, the pattern was different.
If a lesbian woman had an identical twin sister,
that identical twin was only slightly more likely to be lesbian than was a fraternal twin sister.
Similar findings have been reported more recently for a large study involving twins in Sweden.
The evidence from the twin studies suggests that genes play a bigger role in male homosexuality
than in female homosexuality.
Bailey and his colleagues recently reviewed all published twin studies of sexual orientation.
They found that, on average, the identical twin of a homosexual person had a 25% chance of also being homosexual
compared with a 13% chance for the fraternal twin of a homosexual person.
These results are consistent with some genetic influence,
but they also show that environment matters.
Otherwise, all identical twins of homosexual persons would be homosexual.
But Bailey's group clarifies that environment is broader than the social environment,
the ways that parents and peers treat us,
and includes biological factors, too.
One biological factor that is not strictly genetic is older siblings.
How many older siblings do you have?
And if you have older siblings, are they sisters or brothers?
The answer to these questions offer more evidence that the basis for male homosexuality
is different from the basis for female homosexuality.
More than two decades ago, psychologist Ray Blanchard noticed that men with older brothers
were more likely to be homosexual than were men with no older brothers.
And the more older brothers a man has, the more likely he is to become homosexual.
Older sisters have no effect on the likelihood that a man will become homosexual.
Neither do younger brothers or sisters.
More recent research shows that this effect holds only if the older brothers are biological older brothers
sharing the same mother.
Adoptive older brothers or stepbrothers with different mothers
have no effect on the likelihood of a boy growing up to be a homosexual man.
But Blanchard and his colleagues found that this effect did not hold at all for homosexuality in women.
Older sisters, older brothers, younger sisters, younger brothers,
none of them systematically increased or decreased the likelihood
that a girl will grow up to be a lesbian woman.
These findings led Blanchard to suggest that the immune system plays a role
in the development of homosexuality in men, but not women.
Specifically, Blanchard suggested that each male child a woman bears
might trigger the development of antibodies in the woman's body
against portions of the Y chromosome.
With each successive male child, she makes more antibodies against the Y chromosome,
and those antibodies may increase the likelihood
that the male fetus will grow up to be homosexual.
That finding is now called the Fraternal Birth Order, FBO, effect.
Evidence from twin studies, as well as the studies of the FBO effect,
provide good evidence that homosexuality has a biological basis
and that the basis of homosexuality in men
is different from the basis of homosexuality in women.
Lipstick Lesbians and Other Variations
There's now substantial evidence that both gay men and lesbian women
come in at least two varieties,
which we might call hard and soft, or masculine and feminine.
Some gay men project a masculine or even hyper-masculine persona.
Think of the muscle man in leather on a motorcycle.
Other gay men are openly effeminate.
Likewise, lesbian women will tell you about femme and butch.
The femme lesbian, also known as the lipstick lesbian,
is likely to dress in traditionally feminine attire
and is more likely to engage in traditionally feminine pastimes and mannerisms,
such as wearing makeup.
The butch lesbian is more likely to wear her hair short
and she may have less interest in makeup.
Among both gay men and lesbian women,
it is common for opposites to attract.
A butch lesbian will partner with a lipstick lesbian, for example.
Google Ellen DeGeneres and Portia de Rossi wedding
for a sense of how this looks.
However, while this is common, it is by no means universal.
I have met butch lesbians who have partnered with other butch lesbians,
effeminate gay men who have partnered with other effeminate gay men,
and masculine gay men who have partnered with other masculine gay men.
These differences are often apparent early in life,
and they have consequences.
Professor Bailey reports that very feminine gay boys
tend to figure out that they are gay earlier than masculine gay boys do.
The boy who likes to wear girls' dresses and play with dolls
is likely to be teased by other kids who will call him gay.
When he asks a grown-up what gay means and thinks about the answer,
that boy may start to wonder about his own sexual orientation.
But the boy who loves to play football is much less likely to be teased.
He hangs out with other boys.
He may take much longer to realize that girls do not turn him on.
Conversely, butch girls who like to wrestle hogs
may be more likely to figure out that they are lesbian earlier
than the girly girl who likes to wear makeup.
In my own experience as a clinician,
I have seen gay men who are masculine,
gay men who are feminine,
and gay men who are indistinguishable from straight men on every parameter.
It's a continuum.
Likewise, I have seen lesbian women who wear combat boots,
lesbian women who wear lipstick and makeup,
and lesbian women who are indistinguishable from straight women.
Among gay men, the divide between masculine and feminine
varies somewhat across cultures.
In our own culture, by which I mean
mainstream English-speaking culture in the 21st century,
the effeminate stereotype of the gay man predominates.
Back in the summer of 2003,
Bravo launched Queer Eye for the Straight Guy,
a weekly TV show that Entertainment Weekly declared the summer's breakout hit.
Each week, the Fab Five, a squad of five gay men,
would swoop in on an unfashionable straight man
and make him over into a suave debonair hunk.
The makeover took about three days.
The straight man was portrayed as clueless,
initially in matters of taste.
The gay men bought him new clothes,
redecorated his apartment,
even taught him how to shave and so on.
It was a funny show.
But how accurate was its message
that gay men are naturally more competent
and more feminine than straight men
in matters of fashion and personal appearance?
Lewis Bayard, a gay man and a self-described slob,
wrote an op-ed piece for the Washington Post
in which he described how the show had become
a major problem for some of us in the gay community.
The show is placing enormous pressure on me
and on the great silent majority of gay men
who really aren't that fab.
Bayard then proceeded to give a detailed account
of just what a slob he is.
Spider webs and insect carcasses
are everywhere in his apartment.
The cat litter hasn't been changed
at any time in the last decade.
He burns bacon to a shriveled black crisp
that sets off the fire alarm,
and then he eats it.
He wears a red t-shirt with blue and white plaid shorts.
He hasn't shined his shoes in years, and so forth.
Slovenliness knows no sexuality, he wrote.
How does this tie back into the previous chapter?
In chapter 9, we considered boys who are gender atypical,
boys who don't like to hit or be hit,
boys who are more likely to enjoy pastimes
stereotypically associated with girls.
Are those gender atypical boys more likely to be gay?
Yes, they are.
Gender atypical boys are somewhat more likely
than gender typical boys to be homosexual.
And many gay men recall being gender atypical in childhood.
For example, in one study,
researchers compared about 1,000 gay men and lesbian women
with about 500 heterosexual men and women.
They found that gay men were more likely than straight men
to report gender atypical behavior and preferences.
For example, gay men were more likely than straight men
to say that they hadn't liked sports when they were boys
and that they had enjoyed hopscotch or playing house.
But even in that study,
fewer than half of the gay men said
that they had enjoyed gender-typical activities
such as playing house or hopscotch.
The majority of the gay men were gender-typical.
So, I think it's important to stress
that many gay men were not effeminate as boys
and are not effeminate now.
I have heard from many gay men
who tell me how frustrated they are
when people say,
but you don't look gay,
after the man shares his sexual orientation.
Apparently, quite a few people
still expect gay men to look and act effeminate.
Many gay men don't fit that stereotype.
Many of the gay men I've known
over my 30 years as a medical doctor
are roughly as gender-typical as straight men are.
They'd rather watch football than figure skating.
They hate talking about their feelings.
Some gay men are gender-atypical,
but the fact that a man happens to be gay
doesn't necessarily mean that he is gender-atypical.
Conversely, a gender-atypical boy
won't necessarily grow up to be a gay man.
When we look at the evidence regarding lesbian women,
the relationship between gender-atypical behavior
in childhood and sexual orientation in adulthood
is weaker than it is for gay men.
Some researchers have even argued that
for women there is no relationship
between a girl's behavior in childhood,
gender-conforming or not,
and her adult sexual orientation.
Those researchers claim that women are lesbian or straight
for reasons that have nothing to do with
and can't be predicted based on
any facet of childhood behavior.
That claim may be too strong.
There is good evidence that a girl's behavior in childhood
does predict, to some extent,
that girl's sexual orientation in adulthood.
For example, in one study,
researchers invited lesbian women and straight women
to share videos from their childhood.
Lesbian women were more likely than straight women
to have engaged in boy-typical activities
like, say, pretend sword fighting.
Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity
On a superficial level,
the lipstick lesbian putting on makeup
might seem to have more in common
with the flaming gay man putting on makeup
than she has in common with her partner,
a butch lesbian.
But biological sex, male or female,
seems to run deeper than sexual orientation,
gay or straight.
Gay men, whether masculine or feminine,
have more in common with straight men
than they have in common with women.
For example,
when asked to describe an ideal sexual partner,
a 30-year-old straight man
will typically choose a young woman
roughly 18 to 22 years of age.
By contrast,
when a 30-year-old straight woman
is asked to describe her ideal sexual partner,
she is likely to choose a man
a few years older than she is,
and the same is true of lesbian women.
On this parameter,
gay men are indistinguishable from straight men
and quite different from women,
whether gay or straight.
They prefer partners
who are significantly younger than they are.
Gay men and straight men
are also more likely to agree
that the physical attractiveness
of an ideal sexual partner
is of paramount importance.
Straight women and lesbian women
are more likely to say
that physical attractiveness,
while nice,
is not the most important thing,
even in an ideal partner.
Likewise,
with regard to interest in casual sex,
straight men and gay men
both commonly say
that they would welcome
a one-night stand
with an attractive stranger.
Straight women and lesbian women
report much less interest
in a sexual encounter
outside of an ongoing romantic relationship.
In Chapter 6,
we talked about how most girls
and most women
are looking first and foremost
for a relationship.
Most boys and more than a few men
are interested first and foremost
in sex.
Many teenage boys and young men,
both gay and straight,
masturbate over pornography
and some hire prostitutes,
male or female as the case may be.
Masturbating over pornography
and hiring prostitutes
are activities that are far removed
from having a mutual,
ongoing relationship.
You can't have a relationship
with a picture on a screen.
Girls and women,
whether lesbian or straight,
are much less likely
to hire prostitutes
or masturbate over pornography,
although some do.
Girls and women,
whether lesbian or straight,
are more likely
to be looking for
a meaningful relationship
rather than a one-night stand.
In their study of homosexuality,
William Masters
and Virginia Johnson
found that many gay men
are hyper-masculine
in the sense
that they often engage
in sex for its own sake
rather than in the context
of a relationship.
Masters and Johnson
interviewed hundreds of gay men
over many years.
Many gay men told them
about having dozens
or even hundreds
of sex partners,
sometimes more than one partner
in a single evening.
Some gay men described
having anonymous sex
with men they didn't even know.
Masters and Johnson
found that lesbian women,
by contrast,
seldom have sex
with women they don't know.
Some researchers
have suggested
that the greater numbers
of sexual encounters
of gay men
compared with straight men
might reflect
the hyper-masculinity
of gay men.
But other researchers
believe that this difference
between straight men
and gay men
arises simply because
straight men
have to contend
with the reluctance
of women
to engage in casual sex.
As the evolutionary
anthropologist
Donald Simons
has written,
heterosexual men
would be as likely
as homosexual men
to have sex
with strangers
and to stop off
in public restrooms
for five minutes
of fellatio
on the way home
from work
if women were interested
in these activities.
But women are not interested.
Men,
whether straight or gay,
are much more likely
than women,
whether straight or lesbian,
to express interest
in a casual sexual encounter
with an attractive stranger.
What about bisexuality?
Straight women
can be sexually aroused
by attractive men
and lesbian women
can be aroused
by attractive women,
right?
So, presumably,
a woman who is aroused
by both women and men
would be unusual,
would be bisexual,
right?
Maybe not.
When researchers ask women
about their preferred
sexual partner,
the majority of women
say that they prefer men,
a minority of women
say that they prefer women,
and a separate minority
of women say
that they have no preference
between women and men.
They go both ways.
Straight women
are women who prefer
to have sex with men.
But,
when researchers show
straight women
videos of men
having sex with women,
women having sex with women,
and men having sex with men,
there is no difference
in the objective arousal
exhibited by straight women.
Based on objective measures
of arousal,
straight women
are equally aroused
by all three videos,
including the video
of gay men
having sex
with other gay men.
But when researchers
ask straight women
which video
is most arousing,
the straight women
say that the video
of a man and a woman
having sex
is the most arousing,
followed by the video
of the two women
having sex,
followed by the video
of the two men
having sex.
There is a disconnect
between what the straight women
say is sexually arousing
and what's happening
down below.
Researchers have long
recognized that
what somebody tells you
turns them on sexually
may not truly be
what turns them on.
For example,
a gay teenage boy
who has not come to terms
with his own homosexuality
may claim that he is aroused
by pictures of pretty girls
and not aroused
by pictures of handsome boys.
He may truly believe
that he is telling the truth.
Researchers developed
a device that measures
whether a man's penis
is becoming erect.
It's called
a penile plethysmograph.
That gay young man's penis
will respond
to the picture
of the attractive man
but not to the picture
of the pretty girl.
The objective measures,
which are based on blood flow,
give an accurate picture
of what's really going on
whereas the subjective measures,
what a woman or man tells you,
can be influenced
by what the woman or man
wants you to think
of her or him
and by what the woman or man
wants to think
of herself or himself.
In the example I just gave,
where straight women
were shown various videos,
it's likely that the straight women
thought of themselves
as straight women.
They probably believed
that straight women
would be more aroused
by a man and a woman
having sex
than by two women having sex,
so that's what they told
the investigators they felt
and maybe that's what
they thought
they really did feel.
There is a long history
of research demonstrating
that when you ask a question,
most people will give you
the response
that fits best
with their self-concept
of themselves.
To do otherwise
risks an unpleasant situation
that psychologists call
cognitive dissonance.
But in fact,
objective measures
of genital arousal
showed that the straight women
were equally aroused
by two women having sex
as by a man
and a woman having sex.
That pattern
was slightly less true
but only slightly less true
for lesbian women.
Lesbian women
did show more genital arousal
to two women having sex
than they showed
to a man and woman
having sex,
but it was a small difference.
That's different
from what researchers
find with men.
Straight men are aroused
by women
and gay men
are aroused by men.
Actually,
the average straight man
is more aroused
by videos of women
having sex with women
than by a video
of a man having sex
with a woman.
The presence of a man
in the video,
even if it's just a man
having sex with a woman,
results in less sexual arousal
for the average man.
Gay men showed
a completely different
pattern of arousal.
They were totally aroused
by videos of gay men
having sex,
not at all aroused
by videos of women
having sex with other women,
and only slightly aroused
by videos of men
having sex with women.
The differences
between straight men
and straight women
were dramatic.
Straight men were aroused
by women
and not by men,
but straight women,
in terms of genital arousal,
were equally aroused
by all three scenarios.
Women having sex with women,
women having sex with men,
and men having sex with men.
This difference
led Dr. Bailey to ask,
do straight women
even have
a sexual orientation?
Professor Bailey notes
that a big part
of this question
has to do with
how we define
sexual orientation.
If sexual orientation
means the kind of sex
that causes the genitals
to become sexually aroused,
then you can see
Dr. Bailey's point.
Straight women
are equally aroused
by all three scenarios.
So maybe straight women
don't have
a strong sexual orientation
in the way that men,
both gay and straight,
do.
Dr. Bailey
reintroduced
the old-fashioned term
sexual preference.
I'm old enough
to remember the era
30 years ago
when sexual orientation
and sexual preference
were synonyms.
The term sexual preference
has fallen out of use
over the past three decades.
For men,
the term doesn't
make much sense.
To say that a gay man
has a homosexual
sexual preference
is sometimes not accurate.
One reason I began
this chapter
by sharing a conversation
with the parents
of a certain young man
I knew
whom I called Daniel
is because that young man
did not prefer
to be gay.
He would have preferred
to be straight.
But he didn't have a choice.
His sexual orientation
was not,
at that time,
his sexual preference.
In later years,
Daniel did come
to accept
and even to celebrate
being gay.
But Dr. Bailey
thinks maybe
we should consider
using the term
sexual preference
in a meaningful way,
at least regarding
straight women.
For women,
both straight and lesbian,
sexual satisfaction
is about more
than genital arousal
and sexual climax.
It's first and foremost
about a loving relationship.
We explored that difference
in Chapter 6.
A straight woman
may say
that she prefers
to have sex with a man
and that matters
because she is more likely
to feel fulfilled
and loved
in that context.
The fact
that she shows
genital arousal
to a depiction
of lesbian sex
does not mean
that she is really
lesbian or bisexual.
It just means
that there is more
to a woman's
sexual experience
than genital arousal.
It might mean
that genital arousal
is not the most important
part of sexual intimacy,
at least for some women.
This section
is about bisexual people,
but I haven't even
mentioned bisexual people yet.
I had to begin
by explaining
the distinction
between subjective
and objective
sexual arousal
as well as the difference
between sexual preference
and sexual orientation
in order for the research
on bisexual people
to make sense.
Nobody has ever
disputed the reality
that some women
are bisexual.
Nowadays,
we are immersed
in a flood of women
who want us to know
that they go both ways.
For example,
the singer Keisha
told an interviewer,
I don't love just men.
I love people.
Not to be outdone,
entertainer Miley Cyrus
boasts of being pansexual.
As she told one reporter,
I am literally open
to every single thing
that is consenting
and doesn't involve
an animal
and everyone is of age.
Drew Barrymore,
Lady Gaga,
Angelina Jolie,
Lindsay Lohan,
Nicki Minaj,
Anna Paquin,
Katy Perry,
and Rihanna
are all celebrity women,
listed here
in alphabetical order,
who have publicly stated
that they are bisexual.
There is no corresponding
stampede
of young male celebrities
who want you to know
that they are bisexual.
Indeed,
there has been dispute
regarding the existence
of men
who are truly bisexual,
and much of that dispute
has been fueled
by comments
from gay men.
You're either straight,
gay,
or lying,
is an old aphorism
among gay men.
That saying
reflects the trend
of men
who were gay
but claimed
to be bisexual
because there was,
in earlier eras at least,
less social stigma
attached to being bisexual
than to being gay.
And there is good evidence
that at least some men
who identify as bisexual
in their teens
will,
a few years down the road,
identify themselves
as gay.
So,
Professor Bailey
and his colleagues
recruited 30 straight men,
33 bisexual men,
and 38 gay men,
for a study.
In this study,
the men's sexual orientation
was determined
by asking questions
about their desired
sexual partner
as well as by
their self-identification
as gay,
straight,
or bisexual.
They then showed
each man
a video of two gay men
having sex with each other
or a video of two lesbian women
having sex with each other.
Most of the gay men
were much more aroused,
subjectively and objectively,
by the video of the gay men
than by that of the women.
Most of the straight men
were much more aroused,
subjectively and objectively,
by the video of the lesbian women
than they were
by the video of the gay men.
What about the bisexual men?
If bisexual men
are truly bisexual,
then at least some of the men
should have been equally aroused
or almost equally aroused
by the two videos.
But analysis of the data
did not show even a hint
of the expected effect,
according to Bailey
and his colleagues.
Both homosexual
and heterosexual men
had much higher arousal
to one sex
than to the other,
and this was equally true
of bisexual men.
About three-quarters
of the bisexual men
showed a pattern of arousal
that was indistinguishable
from that of gay men,
and about one-quarter
of the bisexual men
showed a pattern of arousal
that was indistinguishable
from that of straight men.
Professor Bailey's study
garnered lots of press.
National Public Radio
even aired a short interview
with Professor Bailey.
The host began by saying,
Men who say that they're bisexual
may not be telling the truth.
More recently,
Dr. Bailey conducted
another study,
making more of an effort
to find men
who were indeed
truly bisexual.
This time,
the researchers
didn't just ask men
whether they were bisexual.
In order to participate
in the subject
as a bisexual man,
a man had to report
having had at least
two sexual encounters
with a man
and at least
two sexual encounters
with a woman.
He also had to report
having been
in a romantic relationship
with a woman
lasting at least three months
and also having been
in a romantic relationship
with a man
lasting at least three months.
The subjects were not aware
of the inclusion criteria
in advance.
They were just asked,
Have you ever been
in a romantic relationship
with a man?
If so,
for how long?
The researchers
also recognized
that some teenage boys
identify themselves
as bisexual
but then come out
as gay
in their early 20s.
So,
every man
had to be
at least 25 years old
in order to participate.
This time,
Professor Bailey
and his colleagues
did find men
who truly
were bisexual.
They were equally aroused
by men
and by women
both subjectively
and objectively.
Dr. Bailey
and his team
acknowledged
that such men
may be uncommon
but they do exist.
However,
this more recent report
did not attract
a flurry of attention
in the mainstream media.
There were no interviews
on national public radio.
Bisexual women
are common,
bisexual men
are less common
but they do exist.
Lesbian
As we've discussed,
women and men
experience sexuality
differently
regardless of whether
they are gay
or straight.
Like Professor Bailey,
Professor Lisa Diamond
has questioned
whether the categories
gay and straight
have the same meanings
for women
that they do for men.
Professor Diamond
spent five years
talking with women
who were in a sexual
relationship
with another woman.
In many cases,
a woman had become
romantically
and sexually involved
with another woman
not so much
because she was
consciously seeking
a lesbian relationship
but simply because
she loved the woman
so much
that sexual intimacy
seemed a natural
next step.
Some of these women
reject the labels
of lesbian
or straight
or bisexual.
They insist
that they relate
to each person
as an individual.
If they love
that person
in a romantic way,
if they want
to be close to them
and hold them
and kiss them,
then sexual intimacy
may just come naturally.
What's the connection
between sex
and love?
We touched on this topic
in Chapter 6,
but Professor Diamond
has explored
how this question
relates to the issue
of lesbian
and straight.
Most people,
and even most psychologists,
have assumed
that romantic love
usually arises
in the context
of sexual desire.
In fact,
for most of the 20th century,
psychologists believed
that romantic love
was little more
than a sublimation
of the urge
to have sex.
What's love
got to do with it
was the name
of a hit song
back in 1984.
What's love
but a second-hand emotion?
That notion,
which seemed so modern
and cutting-edge
in 1984,
may not be accurate,
at least for women.
Diamond and other psychologists
now suggest
that romantic love
may derive
from completely different sources
than sexual desire,
at least in women,
at least in some women.
These psychologists point out
that long-term romantic relationships
share some characteristics
with the relationship
between a parent and child.
Maybe it's no accident
that lovers
sometimes address each other
as baby.
Maybe love
and affection
come from a different part
of the brain
than sexual desire does,
at least in some women.
Maybe romantic relationships
derive from the same part
of the brain
that parent-child love
comes from.
This notion
is related to an area
of psychology
known as
attachment theory.
If the attachment theory
explanation is correct
regarding the basis
for romantic love
in some women,
then we might have
to rethink
some of our assumptions
about same-sex relationships.
Infants do not become
selectively attached
to other-gender
versus same-gender caregivers,
Diamond points out.
Parent-child attachment
isn't programmed
for opposite-sex attachment.
Mothers don't naturally
bond better with sons
and fathers don't naturally
bond better with daughters.
But if parent-child attachment
isn't weighted
in favor of the opposite sex,
and if parent-child attachment
forms at least part
of the basis
for romantic attachments
in adulthood,
at least for some women,
then it might be possible
even for a straight woman
to experience romantic feelings
for another woman
without necessarily wanting
to be sexually intimate
with her.
Professor Diamond
has found that
lesbian relationships
often do arise
out of friendship.
Two women may form
a passionate friendship,
may want to spend
lots of time together,
may even cuddle together.
But if those women
label themselves
as straight,
it might not occur
to either of them
to explore the option
of sexual intimacy.
Still,
their relationship
with each other
might be more
spiritually intimate
and more emotionally
fulfilling
than the sexual relationships
they have with their
boyfriends or husbands.
How meaningful
is it, then,
to classify those women
as lesbian
or as straight?
What does sexual orientation
orient?
Diamond asks.
She suggests
that maybe
our rigid categories
of gay versus straight
get a little blurred
when talking about women.
Where to draw the line
between gay and straight?
Does that line
have the same meaning
for all women?
You will recognize
that Dr. Diamond's
argument overlaps
somewhat with Dr. Bailey's
suggestion
that straight women
don't have
a sexual orientation.
The implication
of Dr. Diamond's work
is that many women
who consider themselves
heterosexual
might actually be bisexual
if the right woman
came into their lives.
And if that's true,
then it might be
equally true
that some women
who consider themselves
lesbian
might also be bisexual
if the right man
came along.
Not all,
not most,
but some.
What You Need to Know If
This is a book
intended primarily
for parents,
for teachers,
and for others
who work with kids.
The material I've presented
so far in this chapter
is only a foundation
for the most important stuff.
What you need to know
and do
if your daughter
or your son
comes to you
and tells you
that she or he
is not straight.
You need to know
girls and boys
who are not straight
are at increased risk
of depression
compared with straight kids.
In one study,
more than 20% of teens
who are not straight
reported attempting suicide
in the past 12 months.
And kids who are not straight
are nearly three times
more likely
than straight kids
to use drugs and alcohol.
But there's nothing
inevitable about this.
Lesbian girls
and gay boys
who report
strong support
from their parents
are much less likely
to have these problems.
What does
strong support mean?
It means
that you tell your child,
I will always love you
no matter
whether you are
straight or gay.
It means
that when your daughter
brings her girlfriend
over to the house
to meet you,
you greet the girlfriend
as warmly
as you would greet
a boyfriend.
It means
that you talk
with the school counselor,
and make sure
that the school
has strong programs
and policies in place
to prevent
your non-straight child
from being bullied.
There has been
real progress
on this parameter
over the past 30 years.
When I was a young doctor
back in the 1980s,
I recall a gay boy
being bullied
at the high school.
The parents contacted
the school
to inform them
what was going on.
They were met
with a shrug
of the shoulders
and a comment
along the lines of,
what do you expect?
He's a homosexual.
Today,
that sort of reaction
would be very rare.
It still happens.
You can find stories online.
But such incidents
are much,
much less common
than they were
20 or 30 years ago.
The most common question
I hear from parents
of girls and boys
who are not straight
is,
will they grow out of it?
The answer
to that question
varies depending
on whether you're
talking about a girl
or a boy.
If your son tells you
that he is gay,
then the answer
is no.
He almost certainly
will not grow out of it.
Almost all gay boys
become gay men
who remain gay men.
If your daughter
tells you
that she is lesbian
or that she is in love
with another girl
and wants to be
intimate with her,
the answer
is trickier.
No one story
predominates.
There are lesbian women
who will tell you,
I always knew
I was lesbian,
just as there are
gay men who will tell you,
I always knew
I was gay.
But I knew a girl,
let's call her Vanessa,
who at age 15
was madly in love
with a 17-year-old boy,
let's call him Caleb,
and dated him
for several months
before Caleb
broke off the relationship.
Then,
one year later,
she fell in love
with a girl.
I always thought
I was straight
until I met Gretchen,
Vanessa told me.
Gretchen was
Vanessa's best friend.
They snuggled together
under a blanket
to watch movies at home.
They hugged.
Gretchen had been
in a romantic relationship
with one girl before,
but Vanessa had not.
Then,
one day,
Gretchen touched Vanessa
in a different way.
Vanessa was going
to push Gretchen's hand away,
but Gretchen said,
Don't you like it
when I do that?
Vanessa told me
that she had to think
for a moment
before she realized
she did like it.
A few weeks later,
Vanessa told her mom
that she was lesbian.
Mom said,
But what about Caleb?
You said you were
in love with Caleb.
Mom tried to convince Vanessa
that Vanessa was really bisexual
or mistaken somehow
about her sexuality.
That's a mistake.
I understand where mom
is coming from,
of course,
and it's possible
that Vanessa
is indeed bisexual.
Professor Diamond
has found some women
who can be
in a loving relationship
with a woman one year
and a man the next.
When the woman
is in the relationship
with a woman,
she may conceptualize
herself as lesbian.
When the same woman
is in a relationship
with a man,
she may conceptualize
herself as straight.
Nothing is gained
by arguing with her
about what term to apply,
and,
in most cases,
nothing is gained
by arguing with your daughter
about what word
to use either.
But here's a word
of advice.
If you have a daughter
like Vanessa
and a year down the road
she breaks up with Gretchen
and starts dating
a young man,
do not say,
I always knew
that lesbian thing
was just a phase.
That's another big mistake
for many reasons.
First of all,
it wasn't just a phase.
Second,
you were showing
disrespect for your daughter
and for her relationships.
If you have a daughter
like Vanessa,
there's a good chance
that she is bisexual.
She may be
with a young man this year
and a young woman the next.
If you disparage
her same-sex relationships,
you are not decreasing
the odds of her having
more same-sex relationships.
You are just increasing
the odds
that she won't tell you
about her same-sex relationships.
And the distance
between you
and your daughter
will grow.
A few years down the road,
when she announces
that she is marrying a woman,
you will be the last to know.
You don't want that.
You want to remain
an important part
of your daughter's life,
as you should.
And you don't accomplish
that objective
by pretending
that your daughter
is somebody she's not.
One question I hear
less often today
than 20 or 30 years ago
is,
are there any programs
that can change
my son,
my daughter?
The answer
to that question
is no.
There is no program
that has been proven
to be effective
in changing
anybody's sexual orientation
in any direction.
There are many programs
that have claimed
that they can change
someone's sexual orientation,
but those claims
have generally turned out
to be untrue
or unsubstantiated.
Indeed,
several states,
such as California
and New Jersey,
have outlawed
reparative therapy programs
claiming to change
a child's
or a teen's
sexual orientation.
There are still
many unanswered questions
about sexual orientation,
some of which seem,
to me,
to be urgently
in need of answer.
For example,
researchers in the Netherlands
found that a gay man
who is in a relationship
with a gay man
is eight times
more likely
to commit suicide
than is a straight man
who is married
to a woman.
By contrast,
a lesbian woman
in a relationship
with a lesbian woman
is no more likely
to commit suicide
than is a straight woman
who is married to a man.
The researchers point out
that the Netherlands
is one of the most tolerant
and accepting countries
in the world
for gay men
and has become
even more tolerant
and accepting.
But in this study,
the younger men
were at the same
high risk
as the older men.
There has been
very little research
directed to understanding
the reasons
behind this finding.
I think it's important
that we figure out
why this is so
and what,
if anything,
we can do about it.
The majority of parents,
like the majority of adults,
are straight.
If you are a straight parent
and your daughter or son
tells you that she or he
is gay,
it's okay to be flummoxed.
It's okay to be confused.
It's even okay to be upset.
But I advise you not
to let your son
see you crying yourself
to sleep.
It's hard for your son
to reconcile,
I love you even if you are gay,
with the image of you
sobbing hysterically.
Your son may reasonably wonder
whether your words
are sincere.
It's okay to seek help,
not necessarily
professional help.
There is nothing wrong
with you or with your child,
unless your child
is anxious or depressed
or has another
psychiatric disorder.
But it's a good idea
to talk with people
who are experienced
at guiding straight parents
through this time.
Other parents,
families,
and friends of lesbians
and gays.
In fact,
that was the name
of a group I know
and recommend.
Parents,
Families,
and Friends
of Lesbians and Gays.
That name was a bit
of a mouthful,
so in 2014
they changed their name
to PFLAG.

Lesbian girls face
special challenges,
as we have seen,
and so do gay boys.
But at the end of the day,
a lesbian girl
is still a girl,
and a gay boy
is still a boy.
What about the boy
who says that he's
really a girl
trapped in the body
of a boy,
or a girl who says
she's really a boy
trapped in the body
of a girl?
That's our next topic.
Chapter 11
Intersex and Transgender
Intersex
Here's what's normal
in our species.
The mother contributes
the egg,
which has an X chromosome.
The father contributes
a sperm,
which has either
an X chromosome
or a Y chromosome.
If the egg is fertilized
by a sperm
with an X chromosome,
the result is a female
with XX chromosomes,
and the baby is born
with a vagina
and two ovaries.
If the egg is fertilized
by a sperm
with a Y chromosome,
the result is a male
with XY chromosomes,
and the baby is born
with a penis
and two testicles.
That's true
for straight girls
and straight boys.
It's equally true
for lesbian girls
and gay boys.
But sometimes
it doesn't happen that way.
For example,
sometimes,
very rarely,
two different sperm,
one carrying an X chromosome
and one carrying
a Y chromosome,
reach the egg
at exactly the same moment
and both sperm
fertilize the same egg.
That's called
double fertilization,
and the result
may be an individual
who has both
XX cells,
female,
and XY cells,
male.
Scientists refer
to this individual
as an
XX-XY
mosaic.
Such individuals
may have both
an ovary
and a testicle.
Such an individual
is said to be
intersex.
The term
intersex
refers to individuals
who are both
female and male.
A very old-fashioned
term for such individuals
is hermaphrodite.
Intersex is rare.
I reviewed
the scholarly literature
on intersex
for a peer-reviewed article
that I published
in the Journal of Sex Research.
Adding up the estimates
of prevalence
for all intersex conditions,
I came up with the result
that 2 out of every
10,000 live births
are intersex.
If you are a teacher
and you work
with 100 students
a year,
you would have to work
for 35 years
to have a better
than 50-50 chance
of encountering
one intersex child.
Although the term
intersex
is still widely used,
the term
disorders of sex
development
or DSD
has become
the preferred term
among doctors
who work
with these individuals.
That's due
in part
to the fact
that some individuals
who have problems
characteristic
of intersex individuals
may not actually
be intersex.
One example
is cloacal extrophy.
Disorders of sex
development,
like intersex conditions,
are very rare
and cloacal extrophy
is no exception.
Only about
one baby
in every 400,000
live births
has cloacal extrophy.
Cloacal extrophy
is a birth defect
in which
the bladder
and the large intestine
are both malformed
and get tangled together.
In XY males
with cloacal extrophy,
the penis
is typically
either small
and malformed
or absent altogether.
What should parents
be advised to do
if their son
is born
with cloacal extrophy?
John Money
was regarded
as one of the
leading scientists
in the field
of gender studies
back in the 1960s
and 1970s.
He championed
the idea,
which was novel
at the time,
that gender
is just a social construct.
Kids aren't born
girls and boys,
Money believed.
They become girls
and boys
because of the way
their parents
raised them.
When a boy
accidentally had
his penis
burned off
in a botched circumcision,
the boy's parents
traveled from Manitoba
to Johns Hopkins University
in Baltimore
to get Dr. Money's advice.
Dr. Money advised
the parents
to raise their son
as a girl.
After all,
if gender
is just a social construct,
something that
society simply invents,
then you can put
a dress on a boy
and raise him
as a girl
and everything
will be fine.
Dr. Money also
recommended that
the parents
have their son
castrated,
removing the testicles,
and begin
female hormone
supplements
around the age
of puberty.
Gender is just
an invention
of society,
Dr. Money said,
but a penis?
Now that's something
you truly can't do
without if you're
going to call
yourself a boy.
Dr. Money published
reports of
the boy who was
raised as a girl.
According to
Dr. Money,
the child was
growing up happily
in the female role,
delighting to play
with dolls
and help mom
in the kitchen.
Meanwhile,
the child's
identical twin,
yes,
there was an
identical twin
who was not
circumcised,
was all boy.
He loved to
roll in the mud
and pretend to
shoot people
with a toy gun.
I remember
reading these
reports when I
was a doctoral
student in psychology
at the University
of Pennsylvania
in the early
1980s.
They were
extraordinarily
persuasive,
not only to me,
but to everybody
I knew who
had read them.
The reports
of the boy
who was raised
as a girl
and the prestige
of the Johns Hopkins
School of Medicine
were such that
for about two decades,
roughly from 1977
through 1997,
most experts
agreed that
gender was
indeed just
a social construct,
an invention
of society.
Applying that
concept to boys
born with
cloacal extrophy
meant raising
the boy
as a girl.
If a rudimentary
penis was present,
it was removed
and a blind
sac simulating
a vagina
would be
surgically created.
Most of these
boys were
castrated as well
so that they
would not have
male hormones
circulating in
their system.
In 1997,
Dr. Milton
Diamond published
a remarkable
piece of
medical detective
work.
Dr. Diamond
had contacted
Dr. Money
years earlier
to ask what
had happened
to the boy
who was raised
as a girl.
Dr. Diamond
wondered why
there hadn't
been any reports
about this
individual for
several years.
How was
puberty going?
Dr. Money
replied that
he had lost
touch with
the family
after they
had moved.
Undeterred,
Dr. Diamond
tracked down
the child,
now a teenager,
and learned
that Dr. Money
had lied.
The boy
who was raised
as a girl
had not adopted
the female role
happily.
Brenda Ramer,
as the child
was called,
was called
Gorilla Girl
and Cavewoman
by her classmates
because of her
masculine ways.
She hated
dolls and dresses.
She liked to
fight and she
was fascinated
by cars.
She was
completely
miserable as
a girl and
twice attempted
suicide.
After the
second suicide
attempt,
her parents
finally told
her the truth,
that she had
been born a boy
but they had
raised her as a
girl on the
advice of
Dr. Money.
Brenda immediately
demanded to be
allowed to
transition to
the male role
despite having
no penis
and no testicles
and despite
having received
female hormone
supplements for
several years.
Brenda chose
the name
David because
he felt that
his life had
been a David
versus Goliath
battle.
David Ramer
could have
chosen to
remain anonymous
but he chose
to go public
explaining that
he never wanted
anyone else to
be tortured the
way he had
been tortured.
In 2004,
David Ramer
committed suicide.
I dedicated
the first edition
of Why Gender
Matters to
David Ramer
out of respect
for his courage
in going public
with his story.
The fallout
from Dr. Money's
fabrication
was substantial.
The fact that
he had lied
to concoct evidence
for his theory
caused some people
to doubt his theory.
Maybe gender
wasn't just a
social invention
after all.
Maybe an XY male
is born a boy.
After all,
raising Brenda
Ramer as a girl
had not helped
her to live as a girl.
Despite the dresses
and the Barbie dolls
and the female hormones
and never having been
told the truth
about being born a boy,
Brenda acted masculine,
had masculine interests,
and rejected everything
about the female role.
But others did not agree
that the revelation
about Dr. Money's deceit
had any implications
for his theories.
They continued
to support Dr. Money's idea
that gender
is just an invention
of society.
They dismissed
the case of Brenda
slash David Ramer
as just an isolated case.
They said,
What conclusions
can you draw
from just one case?
And they noted
that the Ramers
had not switched
their son
to the female role
until 17 months of age
when the child
was a toddler.
Maybe that was too late.
Maybe the experiment
would have worked better
if only the parents
had transitioned
their child
to the female role earlier.
Then, in 2004,
Johns Hopkins urologist
William Reiner
published his report
of 16 boys
with cloacal extrophy.
Despite being a colleague
of Dr. Money's
at Johns Hopkins,
Dr. Reiner had come
to believe that
Dr. Money was mistaken
about gender
being just a social construct.
The parents
of all 16 boys
had been advised
to raise their sons
as girls
in accordance
with Dr. Money's advice
and the medical consensus
in the 1980s and 1990s.
The parents
of two of the boys
refused the advice
and raised their sons
as boys.
A third parent,
who balked
at the recommendation
to raise his son
as a girl,
was threatened
with child protective services
and possible loss
of custody
if he did not comply
with the recommendations
of the experts.
The parents
of the other 14 boys
complied with
the expert recommendation,
raising their sons
as girls
and legally changing
their names.
Each of the 14 boys
was castrated
and plastic surgeons
created a simulated vagina
for each boy.
Nevertheless,
at follow-up
in adolescence,
eight of those 14 boys
were living as males.
Every one of the 14 boys
had male typical interests
despite having been raised
as a girl.
Of the six
who were still living
as female,
one had wished
to become a boy
but accepted her status
as a girl.
Later,
her parents told her
about her past
and she became angry
and withdrawn,
refusing to discuss
the matter.
Parents of the others
are determined
that the girls
will never find out
about their birth status.
Three have become withdrawn
and a fourth
has no friends.
Earlier in this chapter,
I asked,
what should parents
be advised to do
if their son is born
with cloacal extrophy?
Based on the research
of Dr. Reiner,
the answer seems clear.
They should raise
their son as a boy
even if the surgeons
can't construct a penis.
If every cell
in your body
is XY male,
then you're a male
even if you don't
have a penis.
Most of us
have the sense
of being
either female
or male.
We don't think
about it much.
We take it for granted.
But it's hard
to read stories
like those of
Brenda slash David Raymer
and the 16 boys
born with cloacal extrophy
without coming
to the conclusion
that gender identity
is real.
It's something
you are born with,
something programmed
into your chromosomes.
And real distress
can result
when the gender identity
assigned to the child
doesn't fit
that child's
hardwired gender identity.
Today,
most doctors agree
that when an intersex
child is born,
any sort of surgery
on the genitals
should be postponed
until the child
is old enough
to express
their true gender identity.
Transgender
Mike to Christine
Mike Penner
had the job
many men dream of,
sports writer
for a major newspaper.
He arrived
at the Los Angeles Times
in 1983.
He covered
Major League Baseball,
NFL Football,
and professional tennis.
While reporting
on the U.S. Open
Tennis Championship
in 1984,
he met another
sports writer,
Lisa Dillman.
They fell in love.
In 1986,
they married.
Family and friends
agreed that Mike
had always been crazy
about sports.
He was an avid
soccer player.
But there was
another side to Mike
that wasn't as well known.
He liked to dress
in women's clothes.
As a boy,
he would go into
his mother's bedroom
when she wasn't home
and put on her things.
As a man,
he continued
to cross-dress.
It's not clear
how and when
his wife,
Lisa,
learned that her husband
liked to wear
women's clothes.
Claire Winter,
a friend of Penner's,
said,
I'm pretty sure
Lisa knew
what her husband
was doing.
Lisa Dillman
has never given
a detailed interview
about her relationship
with her husband,
so we don't know
when she learned
about her husband's
cross-dressing.
We do know
that when Mike
announced that he
wanted to transition
to being a woman,
Lisa wasn't happy.
Mike had been close
to Lisa's family,
but there were
blowout arguments
after Mike announced
that he wanted
to live as a woman.
How could he do
this to her?
Lisa's parents demanded.
Although Mike
got no backing
from his wife
regarding his desire
to transition,
he did get
tremendous support
from his employer,
the Los Angeles Times.
Mike offered
to give up his job
as a sports writer,
but his boss,
Randy Harvey,
encouraged him
to stay on.
Harvey also asked Mike
to write a column
explaining his decision.
On April 26, 2007,
the Los Angeles Times
published Mike's essay
titled Old Mike
Knew Christine.
My brain was wired female,
Penner explained.
He felt that he was
a woman trapped
in the body of a man,
so he was going to leave
Mike Penner behind.
Christine Daniels
took his place.
The Los Angeles Times
even hosted
Daniels' blog
about the transition process
titled Woman in Progress.
Christine Daniels,
formerly known as Mike Penner,
became a media sensation
overnight.
A friend from the sports world,
Rick Riley,
wrote a glowing column
for Sports Illustrated
titled Extreme Makeover.
Riley described
the new Christine
as amazing
and not bad looking,
better than she ever was
as a guy,
put it that way.
Transgender activists
promoted Daniels
as their new
high-profile mascot,
with special kudos
for the enlightened leadership
shown by the Los Angeles Times.
Vanity Fair arranged
for the photographer
Robert Maxwell
to do a photo shoot
for a major feature
in the magazine,
scheduled to be published
alongside an interview
by Vanity Fair reporter
Evan Wright.
What happened next
is a matter of dispute,
although all sides agreed
that the Vanity Fair project
was a catastrophe.
Photographer Maxwell
asked afterward,
How do you tell someone
who looks like a man
you're a beautiful woman?
Maxwell's colleague
Evan Wright
said that Daniels
seemed suicidal
and that he wasn't sure
how to cover Daniels
without undermining
her fantasy conception
of who she is.
Wright and Maxwell
said that they decided
to pull the plug
on the story.
But Daniels
and her friends
claimed that Vanity Fair
still wanted to proceed
with the story
after the photo shoot
and that Daniels
had to demand
that the story
be canceled.
Daniels said
that Maxwell
was determined
to portray her
as a man in a dress.
Around the same time,
Daniels began
to feel estranged
from some
in the transgender community,
saying that she felt
used by transgender activists
to advance an agenda
that was not her own.
She canceled a speech
she was scheduled
to give
for a Denver
transgender conference.
She didn't appear
when she was nominated
for an award
by GLAAD,
an LGBT advocacy group.
And her wife,
Lisa Dillman,
was not supportive
of her husband's decision
to transition
to female.
On May 23, 2007,
just four weeks
after publication
of the
Old Mike
New Christine essay,
Dillman filed
for divorce.
She reportedly said,
I don't even want
to see you around
the office
unless I absolutely
have to.
I don't ever want
to see you that way.
Everyone who knew Daniels
agrees that Daniels
was crushed
by Dillman's
lack of support.
In April 2008,
Daniels took medical leave
from the Los Angeles Times
complaining of severe
abdominal pain.
In June 2008,
she was hospitalized.
Doctors concluded
that her abdominal pain
was due to stress
and depression.
They prescribed
an antipsychotic medication,
Zyprexa,
along with an antidepressant,
Elevil.
Daniels canceled plans
for sex reassignment surgery,
which is nowadays
sometimes called
gender confirmation surgery.
I can't do it anymore,
Daniels told her friend,
Amy LeCoe.
Which part can't you do?
LeCoe asked.
After a long silence,
Daniels answered,
I had the perfect life
with Lisa,
and I threw it all away.
In the summer of 2008,
Daniels stopped
taking female hormones
and also stopped
electrolysis treatments
to remove hair.
Christine Daniels
slowly morphed back
into Mike Penner.
Penner gave away
his women's clothes
and jewelry
and began presenting himself
as a man again.
His friends agreed
that one motivation
for the transition
was Penner's hope
that he could win
his wife back again.
He hoped returning
to being Mike
could possibly lead
to reconciliation
with Lisa,
his pastor said.
He loved Lisa.
There was no doubt
about that.
Penner was hospitalized
twice in 2009.
One hospitalization
occurred after his brother
became concerned
about comments
Penner had made
about trying
to commit suicide.
On November 27, 2009,
exactly one year
to the day
after his divorce
was finalized,
Mike Penner
put on a blue
long-sleeved shirt,
black jeans,
and black and white
Adidas sneakers,
climbed into his
Toyota Camry
in the closed garage
beneath his apartment,
snaked a hose
from the exhaust pipe
into the car,
and breathed carbon monoxide
until he died.
According to the coroner's report,
the suicide note expressed
Penner's love
for his ex-wife.
Transgender
Wyatt to Nicole
Wyatt and Jonas Maines
were born
identical twin boys.
They were raised
by their adoptive parents,
Kelly and Wayne Maines,
first in upstate New York
and then in Maine.
Jonas loved everything
Star Wars
and Power Rangers.
Wyatt loved everything
Barbie.
Jonas would play
the boy character
and Wyatt
would play
the girl character.
Some of Wyatt's favorites
included Dorothy
from The Wizard of Oz
and Ariel
from The Little Mermaid.
At age three,
Wyatt would run
around the house
with a red shirt
on his head
trying to imitate
Ariel's flowing red hair.
At age four,
he told his parents
that he wanted
to be a girl.
He began referring
to himself
as a boy girl
and asked his parents
questions such as,
when do I get
to be a girl?
and when will
my penis fall off?
When the family
went shopping,
Wyatt went straight
to the girl's clothes
and asked to buy dresses.
In fourth grade,
when the teacher
asked every student
to draw a self-portrait,
Wyatt drew a girl
with long curly hair,
purple eyeshadow,
and jewelry.
In fifth grade,
with the approval
of his parents,
Wyatt officially
changed his name
to Nicole
and began life
as a girl.
Shortly thereafter,
in the summer
before fifth grade,
Nicole began
complaining of stomach aches.
She just lies around
moaning,
her mother told
the pediatrician.
The doctor
prescribed Prozac.
Nicole wanted
to use the girl's bathroom,
but the grandfather
of a student
at the school protested,
so the school required
her to use
the teacher's bathroom,
a private,
single-stall restroom.
Nicole and her parents
didn't like
this arrangement,
which Nicole felt
singled her out
as different.
The parents
were also unhappy
about the lack
of perceived support
from the school district.
After sixth grade,
the family moved
south to Portland,
and they filed
a lawsuit
against their
old school district
in Orono.
Nicole went
undercover
for the next
two years
at the public school
in Portland.
Nobody there knew
that Nicole Maines
had actually
been born a boy
and still had
a penis and testicles.
The stress
of keeping the secret
was a burden
for Nicole,
her brother,
and her parents.
In ninth grade,
Nicole enrolled
at a private school,
and she and her parents
decided to break cover.
In fact,
Nicole and her parents
began lobbying
the Maine State Legislature
in support
of transgender rights.
The Boston Globe
ran a front-page
feature profile,
and Nicole Maines
suddenly found
that she had become
a celebrity.
She was invited
to the White House,
along with other LGBT
activists where she
and the other guests
were greeted
by President Obama.
The family was dealt
a setback
in September 2012
when the judge
ruled against them
in their lawsuit
against the Maine
public school.
While the judge
said that he was
sympathetic to
Nicole's plight,
he concluded
that the school's
requirement that
Nicole use the
faculty single-stall
restroom did not
constitute deliberate
harassment,
as required for their
claim under state law.
The Maines appealed
to the State Supreme Court.
In January 2014,
the State Supreme Court
ruled in favor
of the Maines
and awarded the family
$75,000 in damages.
After paying
attorney's fees,
the Maines took home
$44,000 from the award.
The family decided
to use the money
to pay for Nicole's
gender reassignment
surgery,
removal of the penis
and testicles
and creation
of a 5-inch-long
closed-end tunnel
in the perineum
to simulate a vagina.
Nicole underwent
the surgery
in July 2015.
That same month,
coincidentally,
the Obama administration
moved to lift
the ban
against transgender
individuals
serving in the
U.S. armed forces.
As of this writing,
in May 2017,
Nicole Maines
is reportedly
healthy and happy
and undergraduate
studying theater
at the University
of Maine.
Transgender
Anna to...
Hmm?
Anna's parents
recall her
as a sweet,
quiet,
affectionate child.
She could spend
a long time
concentrating on
one task
without fidgeting.
She excelled
in school
and was something
of a teacher's pet.
She didn't require
any prompting
to do her homework,
practice the piano,
or go to soccer practice.
As a teenager,
she dressed in
the same fashion
as most of the other
girls at her school,
a casual,
no-makeup look.
When the occasion
permitted,
she would wear a dress
and put on makeup
skillfully.
In ninth grade,
she came out
as lesbian,
and at one point
she cut her hair short.
She eventually
grew out her hair again
and seemed feminine.
Not a girly girl,
but definitely
not a tomboy.
Her mom described
her as
100% girl.
Then,
during her junior year
of high school,
something changed.
She stopped talking
to everybody
in the family,
not only her parents,
but also her siblings
and even the household pets.
This went on
for several weeks.
With the help
of a mediator,
she started talking
with her family again,
but often
with a resentful hostility
that her parents
could not understand.
She attended
a highly selective
university
far away from home.
The first year
went okay,
but when Anna
came home the summer
after that first year,
she was different.
Her mother found
a journal Anna
was keeping.
The writing
was impossibly small,
about a five-point
font size
and in a strange script.
The contents
were garbled
and almost
unintelligible.
Her demeanor
was different.
Her parents
called it
the dark mask.
The first semester
of her sophomore year,
she seemed
to go off the rails.
She was staying up
almost all night
without requiring sleep.
She was cycling
through majors
rapidly,
almost randomly,
from history
to astrophysics
to women's studies.
When her parents
saw her later
that fall,
she looked disheveled.
She had always
been careful
with her appearance
before,
but now
she didn't seem
to care.
She admitted
that she had not
combed her hair
in months.
She also had
a noticeable mustache
on her upper lip
that she had never
had before,
as well as severe acne.
She had always
been in good shape
and loved to go
to the gym
and attend yoga classes.
Now,
she just lay around
the house
looking at her phone
and her laptop.
She didn't even
want to walk
the dog.
One day,
she simply
disappeared.
After much frantic
texting and calling,
her parents discovered
that she had left
the house
with minimal belongings
and Ubered
to the airport
to hop a flight
back to the distant city
where her university
was located.
She refused
to speak to her parents
or see them.
When the parents
contacted the dean
on call,
they were informed,
Your daughter
is in a safe space.
Days later,
Anna sent an email
notifying her parents
that she had been
diagnosed as bipolar
and was with people
who understood
the disorder.
She was referring
to peers.
The parents
flew out
to the university.
Anna refused
to meet with them.
A psychologist
from student counseling
did agree
to meet with the parents.
When asked
point-blank
about their daughter
and the mustache
and the acne,
the psychologist
stated that
gender-bending
was popular
on campus
and it was possible
to get sex-changing
hormones via
the student health
clinic.
The horrified mother
asked if it could
be possible
for someone
diagnosed with
bipolar disorder
to get sex-changing
hormones.
Yes,
the psychologist
replied.
It was the policy
of the college
to support
transgender students.
The parents
received a short
email from their
daughter over
a month later.
Hi,
I am now trans.
I hope you guys
are doing well.
Transgender
can mean many things,
but if we're going
to have a serious
conversation about
transgender,
we must recognize
that some
psychiatric disorders,
such as bipolar
disorder and
schizophrenia,
can involve a
delusion that one
is the other sex.
In one case,
a 39-year-old
schizophrenic man
who was using
LSD
was absolutely
convinced that
he was a woman
trapped in the
body of a man.
He wanted to
undergo sex
reassignment surgery,
to be castrated,
to have his penis
removed and an
artificial vagina
created.
But when he
stopped taking
LSD and his
schizophrenia was
treated with a low
dose of an
antipsychotic
medication,
the transgender
delusion went
away.
Right now,
we just don't
know what
proportion of
transgender people
are transgender
as the result
of a psychiatric
disorder,
but the proportion
is certainly
greater than
zero.
Cases like that
39-year-old man
suggest that a
minimum standard
of care for any
individual who
believes that they
are transgender
should include at
least a cursory
evaluation to make
sure that the
individual is not
bipolar or
schizophrenic.
There are good
clinicians out
there who follow
just such a
sensible approach.
They carefully
evaluate each
transgender individual
to identify any
underlying psychiatric
diagnosis that
might be relevant.
We will meet one
such clinician,
Dr. Kenneth Zucker,
toward the end of
this chapter.
We will also learn
that Dr. Zucker was
forced out of his
position in part due
to lobbying by
transgender activists
who labeled Dr. Zucker
transphobic,
because he recognized
and publicly
documented cases in
which the patient's
transgender identity
was a symptom of
an underlying
psychiatric disorder.
The transgender
activists seem to
be motivated not
primarily by data
or research,
but by a belief,
the belief that
transgender is a
normal variation.
If that's true,
if being transgender
is a normal
variation just like
being left-handed,
then any effort
to align a patient's
gender identity
with their biological
sex would clearly
be misguided,
just as trying to
make a left-handed
person right with
their right hand
is misguided.
But transgender
is not a normal
variation.
As we discussed
in Chapter 10,
people with normal
variations such as
left-handedness do
not require any
professional intervention.
But a transgender
individual will require
treatment with sex
hormones and perhaps
even sex reassignment
surgery in order to
live in the other
sex role.
Left-handed people
don't need prescription
medications or
surgical intervention
in order to live
as left-handed people.
But a transgender
individual will need
lifelong treatment
with cross-sex
hormones in order to
pass as a member
of the other sex.
Prior to 1942,
prescription female
hormones were not
available.
And without
prescription hormones,
an adult male
wearing a dress
looks like a man
in a dress.
The modern conception
of transgender,
the notion that a
child-born male can,
as an adult,
be made to look
like a woman and
pass as a woman,
rests on the ready
availability of
interventions such
as electrolysis,
plastic surgery,
and prescription
hormones.
It is as much
a creation of the
modern world as
the telephone and
the digital computer.
The Best Interest
of the Child
I'm a clinician.
I see patients
in the office.
When I am meeting
a patient for the
first time, I try
to answer questions
such as,
does this patient
have a medical
or psychiatric
problem, or is
this just a
variation of normal
that doesn't require
any intervention?
If this patient
does have a medical
or psychiatric
problem, what
exactly is the
problem?
What are the
options available
for treatment?
Which option is
most likely to
help the patient
fulfill her or
his potential?
Sometimes I
conclude that a
patient doesn't
have a medical
or psychiatric
problem at all.
For example, a
mother and father
asked me to
evaluate their son
who was five
years old.
The school had
sent a note home
saying that the
boy was fidgety
and inattentive.
On further
evaluation, I
learned that
kindergarten at
this school
consisted of 90
minute sessions
devoted to
learning phonics,
during which time
all children must
sit still, be
quiet, and pay
attention.
The school had
abolished recess in
order to allow
more time for
classroom instruction.
When I evaluated
this boy face-to-face,
I concluded that he
did not have ADHD
or any other
abnormality.
The real pathology
in this case lay
not in the boy
at all, but in
the school and in
its unrealistic
expectation that a
five-year-old boy
should sit still,
be quiet, and pay
attention for 90
uninterrupted minutes
of instruction about
diphthongs and
digraphs.
What if parents bring
in a five-year-old boy
and report that this
boy likes to dress
up like a girl?
And he said that he
really is a girl.
He also said that
girls have more fun
than boys.
He said that all
boys want to do is
to fight or to
pretend that they
are fighting.
This boy is unusual.
So, a reasonable
next question is,
what do we know
about such boys?
We know that most
young boys who say
that they are girls
grow up to be men
who do not think
that they are women
and who do not
want to be women.
We now have many
studies in which
researchers have
followed such boys
for 15 or 20 years
well into adulthood.
In every study,
the great majority
of such boys
grow up to be men
who have no interest
in becoming women.
In one of the
largest such studies
of 139 boys
who insisted in
childhood that they
were really girls
trapped in the bodies
of boys,
only 12% still felt
that way as
adolescents or adults.
In other words,
88% of the boys
grew out of it.
Many of those boys
grew up to be gay men.
Some grew up to be
straight men.
But they are men.
They don't need
hormone supplements
or surgery.
They are capable
of fathering children.
In other words,
for the majority
of young boys
who say they are
really girls,
the desire to be a girl
is just a phase.
For such boys,
allowing the boy
to present himself
as a girl
will be a major
stumbling block
on his road
to becoming a man,
whether a gay man
or a straight man.
A reasonable
first intervention
in the case
I just described,
the five-year-old boy
who wanted to dress
as a girl,
would be to connect
the boy to a more
diverse community
of boys.
This boy said that
all boys want to do
is to fight
or to pretend
they are fighting.
This particular boy
likes to dance
and do craft projects.
I myself loved
to do macrame
as a boy,
as I mentioned
in Chapter 9,
and I studied
tap dancing
for several years.
Broaden his understanding
of what it means
to be a boy.
Boys can be great dancers.
Boys can be great artists.
Boys don't have to fight
or pretend
they are fighting.
I find that it's helpful
to stay focused
on the best interest
of the child.
What is in this child's
best interest?
When in doubt,
err on the side
of normal variation.
If,
after a careful evaluation,
I am still uncertain
whether this child
is truly transgender,
then I will err
on the side
of normal variation.
If we proceed
on the assumption
that this boy,
like most boys
who say that they are girls,
is experiencing a phase,
then no medical
or surgical intervention
is required.
No hormone shots.
No surgery.
No letters
to the other parents
at the school
explaining that
Wyatt is now Nicole.
If,
further down the road,
it appears that this boy
truly is transgender,
then we can always
reconsider and reassess.
By contrast,
if we conclude
that this child
is transgender
and we allow the child
to begin dressing
like a girl
and to assume
a female persona,
the child will require
hormone shots.
Medical treatment
of a transgender child
begins with injections
of a synthetic
gonadotropin-releasing
hormone
GnRH agonist,
such as Lupron,
to delay the onset
of puberty.
Then,
around the age of puberty,
this child will begin
receiving female hormones.
Sex reassignment surgery
will also need
to be considered.
Each of these steps
constitutes a major
medical intervention
with significant consequences
and risks.
If this child
later decides
that he is really
a boy after all,
we have not served
this child well
by indulging the whim
of a five-year-old
or an eight-year-old.
The most common outcome
for the five-year-old boy
or eight-year-old boy
who says that he is
really a girl
twenty years down the road
is a boy who grows up
to be a gay man.
But a minority
of such boys
will persist
in their transgender identity
and grow up
to be trans women.
How to tell
who is who
at age five
or age eight?
It isn't easy.
Most five-year-olds
and even most
eight-year-olds
have little sense
of their own
sexual orientation
prior to the onset
of puberty.
Many kids
in that age group
when presented
with the facts of life
just pronounce it all
to be yucky.
Heterosexual intimacy
and homosexual intimacy
seem equally strange
and repellent
to many prepubescent kids.
So, it's very difficult
for that eight-year-old boy
who loves to dress up
as a princess
who believes himself
to be a girl
to know whether he might
grow up to be a gay man
and feel right
as a gay man.
Being a girl
may seem more real
and more comprehensible.
He knows what girls are.
He has met girls.
He has friends
who are girls.
He may not really understand
at age five
or age eight
what a gay man is.
He may not even know
a gay man.
This approach,
erring on the side
of the normal variation
rather than rushing
to classify the child
as transgender,
seems to me
to be common sense
best practice
if there is any doubt
at all regarding the child,
particularly if the child
is very young,
say,
less than nine years old.
I will have more to say
at the end of this chapter
about what to say
to a boy
who says he's a girl
or a girl
who says she's a boy.
Two kinds of MTF
Earlier,
I shared the stories
of Mike Penner
slash Christine Daniels
and Wyatt
slash Nicole Maines.
Both of these individuals
were born as XY males.
Both of them
were convinced
that they would be happier
living as females.
Both underwent
medical treatment,
including female hormones,
to help them
make that transition.
Mike Penner
was not happy
living as Christine.
He reverted to living
as a man
and ultimately
committed suicide.
Nicole Maines
appears to be happy
living as Nicole
and has zero interest
in reverting
to a male role.
Aside from those
obvious differences,
there are other differences
that are important
in understanding
the male-to-female,
usually abbreviated
MTF,
transsexual.
Recall that Mike Penner
was an athlete
who grew up
to be a sports writer.
Wyatt Maines,
by contrast,
never liked
boy-typical activities
such as football.
Also,
Mike Penner
always liked women.
He never had any interest
in sexual intimacy
with men.
Conversely,
Nicole Maines
likes men.
She reports
no interest
in sexual intimacy
with women.
Researchers
who study
MTF transsexuals
have found
that this distinction
is robust.
MTF transsexuals
come in two varieties
with little overlap.
MTF transsexuals
such as
Wyatt slash
Nicole Maines
are referred to
as
homosexual transsexuals
because their
sexual orientation
is homosexual
relative to the sex
they were born as.
Wyatt Maines
was born
an XY male
and has a sexual
orientation
toward intimacy
with men,
hence the term
homosexual.
MTF transsexuals
such as
Mike Penner
slash Christine Daniels
are referred to
as heterosexual
transsexuals
because their
sexual orientation
is heterosexual
relative to the sex
they were born with.
Mike Penner
was born
an XY male
and had a sexual
orientation
toward intimacy
with women,
hence the term
heterosexual.
researchers find
that heterosexual
MTF transsexuals
like Mike Penner
typically have
stereotypically
masculine interests
as boys
and as men.
They often like
sports
and may excel
in athletics.
They may even
be champion athletes
and win gold medals.
Or they may
enter the military
where they may
serve as Navy SEALs
or Green Berets.
Conversely,
homosexual
MTF transsexuals
like Nicole Maines
often have
hyper-feminine
interests.
They are more
girly than most
girls.
They love princesses
and glitter
and high heels.
They are often
flamboyant
and melodramatic.
