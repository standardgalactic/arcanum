likely to take it personally. Girls increasingly are posting provocative photos of themselves on
social media sites such as Instagram. And girls are much more likely than boys to post sexually
appealing or sexually provocative photos of themselves. A sexual double standard is now
blatant on social media sites. Girls feel pressure to present themselves sexually. Boys don't. In one
recent study of Instagram selfies, teenage girls were much more likely to post sexualized poses,
lying on their backs, etc., while the boys were much more likely to post selfies of themselves,
lifting something heavy, showing off their muscles, etc. The girls were also much more likely than the
boys to post photos of their bodies from the neck down, with no face at all. On Instagram, if you're
a girl, it seems that what really matters is what's below your neck. In some ways, social media
create a lose-lose situation for girls. If a girl doesn't give in to the pressure and post suggestive
photos, the boys may call her a prude. But if a girl does post sexualized photos of herself,
recent studies suggest that other girls will perceive her as less appealing as a friend
and less socially competent. Boys are more likely than girls to post a wide range of their lived
experience on social media. Girls post a much narrower slice of their life. A boy and a girl both get
sick. They both throw up. The boy posts a photo of his vomit on his Instagram. Girls almost never do
that. And there's yet another element that comes into play in understanding girl-boy differences
in the consequences of using social media. Boys tend to overestimate how good-looking they are.
They think they are better-looking than their peers rate them as being. Girls are more likely to rate
themselves less attractive than their peers rate them as being. As kids go through adolescence,
girls become more dissatisfied with their bodies while boys become more satisfied with their bodies.
Girls are more likely than boys to notice their own mistakes and to remember them. Boys are more
likely than girls to overestimate how interesting their own lives are to other people.
Now, put all these findings together. Imagine a girl. Maybe she's 11 years old or 14 or 17.
She's sitting in her bedroom, all by herself. She's looking at what other girls have posted on
Instagram or sent via Snapchat. There's Emily at the football game. There's Ashley at the party.
There's Vanessa with her puppy. Isn't it cute? And she thinks,
I'm just sitting here in my bedroom not doing anything. My life sucks.
The more time you spend on social media comparing yourself to other people, the more likely you are
to become depressed. That's true for both girls and boys, but this effect is much larger for girls
than it is for boys. When you look at all the research together, you can understand why social
media are more likely to be toxic for girls than for boys. Girls are more likely than boys to post
sexually provocative photos of themselves. Women and girls are more invested in social media.
They spend more time on social media and more time texting than do boys and men.
Boys are more likely to spend free time playing video games rather than filtering and cropping
their selfie for Instagram. Video games have their own hazards, which we will get to in a moment.
And a boy looking at Jacob's photo of his own vomit is less likely to want to be Jacob,
while a girl looking at Vanessa's cute puppy and Emily's great selfie at the football game
may believe that Vanessa and Emily really are leading happier, more interesting lives than she is.
So what should you do about this if you have a daughter?
Begin by explaining to her that everybody's life is a mix of happy and sad,
a mix of success and disappointment. And for most humans who have ever lived,
there's been more sad than happy, more disappointment than success.
Explain that that's true for almost everybody, even for Emily,
who only posts fun and happy stuff on her Instagram.
That's not a new insight. The first noble truth of Buddhism is that life is suffering.
Socrates, facing his own imminent death, taught his students that true philosophy consists of the
cheerful contemplation of one's own death. Paul, writing to the Corinthians, told them that he had
reason to be sad, yet was always filled with joy. 2 Corinthians 6, verse 10
How can you do that? How can you be filled with joy when you have reason to be sad?
You will experience many disappointments in life. You will watch your loved ones die. And then you will die.
That's true for you. It's true for me. How then can any of us choose to walk through life joyfully?
That, I think, is the first question of any serious philosophy or grown-up religion.
But this girl, sitting in her bedroom looking at the other girls' Instagram and Snapchat feeds,
will not take that first step on the road to maturity,
because she still thinks that Vanessa and Emily are having a great time,
that she's the only one who is bored, frustrated, lonely.
So one part of your strategy is to give the talk, explaining that everybody's life is a mix of
happy and sad, and not to be misled by the way girls represent themselves on social media.
But the talk by itself is not enough. You also must govern and guide your daughter's use of social
media, and your son's use as well. I encourage you to install apps and monitoring software such as
Net Nanny or My Mobile Watchdog for this purpose. These programs make it easy for you to help your son
or daughter to develop good habits and not to spend hours a day on social media. You can configure
these apps to limit the amount of time your kid spends on any particular site or app, such as
Instagram or Snapchat. I suggest no more than 20 to 30 minutes a day. Some parents prohibit access to
these websites altogether. I understand their rationale, but I don't think that approach
works for all families or even for most. For many girls today, Instagram is a major means of
communicating with friends. I get that. 20 minutes a day is enough time to log on, get your messages,
respond, and log off. Parents have to take the lead in setting limits. It's not reasonable to put this
burden in the lap of your 14-year-old daughter. What is she supposed to say when her friend says,
Hey, how come you didn't like the photo I posted on Instagram last night? It's not reasonable to
expect a 14-year-old to say something like, Researchers have found that the more time a girl
spends on social media, the more likely the girl is to become depressed. You have to allow her to say,
Hey, my evil parents have installed this app on my device that locks me out after 20 minutes.
I'll like your photo when I log on again tonight. First thing, I promise.
If you are uncomfortable governing and guiding your child's use of social media,
then I encourage you to read my book, The Collapse of Parenting. In that book,
I explore the arguments for and against authoritative parenting. I am not going to repeat those arguments
here except to say, It's not your job to be your kid's best friend. There are lots of girls out
there who can be your daughter's best friend. But a friend can't limit how much time your daughter
spends on social media. You can, and you must. In addition to limiting the amount of time your
daughter or son spends on social media, I also recommend that you ban the bedroom. No screens in
the bedroom. No devices in the bedroom. In the typical American households today, when kids go
home, they usually go straight to their bedrooms and aren't seen again except perhaps for meals.
That's crazy. A family can't be a family if the kids spend more time alone in their bedrooms than
with their family members. Insist that your daughter or son do whatever they're doing online
in a public space. In the kitchen or the living room. There should be nothing in the bedroom except
a bed. No TV, no PlayStation, no Xbox, no screens. No electronics in the bedroom. That's not just my
opinion. That's the official recommendation of the American Academy of Pediatrics.
There are often unexpected benefits to banning the bedroom. I've heard from many parents who have told
me that their daughter or son said that they had to stay up till midnight or later in order to finish
all the homework that was assigned in school, and much of that homework had to be done on the computer
online. Once the computer is in the kitchen, with Dad answering his emails on his device across the
kitchen table from his daughter, who is doing her homework on her device, she gets her homework done by
8.30 p.m. The daughter wasn't lying about staying up until midnight. She just didn't realize how many
hours she was spending on social media or shopping online. But when Dad is in the same room a few feet
away, she gets online, gets the homework done, and is ready for bed.
Video Games
We have seen that girls are more susceptible than boys to the toxic effects of social media.
Conversely, boys may be more vulnerable than girls to the bad effects of video games.
To begin with, the average boy spends significantly more time playing video games than does the average
girl. Boys are more likely than girls to sacrifice real-world social activities in order to play video
games, and more likely to skip doing homework in order to play video games.
Boys are twice as likely as girls to play violent video games.
And even when girls and boys spend the same amount of time playing the same video games,
different areas of the brain light up in boys compared with girls, leading researchers to conclude
that video games may be more rewarding to boys, more likely to give boys a thrill compared with girls.
If you haven't played video games in the past ten years, you may not understand how addictive
some of them can be, owing to advances in technology.
A boy can now play a video game in which he climbs into a tank, feels the rumble from 300-watt
subwoofers as his tank treads crush the rubble of a demolished house, and fires off depleted
uranium rounds at enemy outposts as he enjoys the thrill of victory or the agony of defeat
when three enemy tanks blast him almost simultaneously.
But the agony of defeat is lessened by the knowledge that he can just hit restart and play
it all over again.
Today, any boy with a high-speed internet connection can play in real-time against another gamer
across town or on the other side of the planet.
Sophisticated headsets allow boys to engage in simulated online combat in teams, arranging
coordinated ambushes of enemy fighters using high-tech virtual weaponry.
After your son has spent two hours leading a squad of fighters in a raid on terrorist headquarters,
issuing commands through his headset-mounted microphone to his online comrades, and raced through
a hail of virtual bullets to destroy the enemy power generator, well, studying Spanish grammar
from a textbook can seem pretty dull.
The virtual world is fast-moving, interactive, collaborative, and fun.
And it is heroic.
For years, Sony's lead advertising line for its PS4 video game console was
Greatness Awaits.
The official Sony commercial offers some insight.
The actor, a young man looking directly into the camera as special effects explode around him,
says,
Who are you to be ordinary?
Who are you to be anonymous?
You, whose name should be spoken in reverent tones or in terrified whispers.
In the real world, maybe you're just an ordinary anonymous kid who's not doing very well in school.
But in the world of the video game, you can be great.
You can be a hero.
I had the honor of giving a keynote presentation at a statewide conference for juvenile justice professionals
in New Mexico.
The topic was Boys Adrift.
Boys who aren't doing well in the real world.
Boys who aren't doing their best.
Boys who are disengaged.
The title of my second book was Boys Adrift.
After my presentation, there was a panel discussion.
One of the panelists was Judge John Romero, who is the presiding judge of the juvenile court in Albuquerque.
At that time, Judge Romero also presided over a therapeutic program for boys on probation.
Judge Romero talked about how many teenage boys he met who had been convicted of a violent crime, often gang-related violence.
He shared how he talked with these boys in the less formal setting of the therapeutic program, without the robe and the trappings of court.
Judge Romero asked the boys,
Why are you doing this?
You seem to be a smart kid.
Don't you understand that joining a gang and engaging in gang-related violence greatly increases the chance that you're going to get killed or go to jail?
And greatly decreases the likelihood that you will graduate from high school or get a good job?
Judge Romero acknowledged that it took him some time, more than a year of listening to the boys, before he understood what they were saying to him.
He told us that these boys want to be seen as heroes in the eyes of their peers and in their own eyes.
The gang understands that.
The gang gives the boy a gun and a mission, to kill the leader of the rival gang.
If the boy succeeds, he's a hero.
If he is killed trying, he's still a hero.
If he is arrested by the police and sent to jail, he's still a hero.
If he chickens out, he's a wuss.
That's a challenge the boy can understand.
We all nodded, but then Judge Romero looked straight at the audience.
Most of you here don't live in the barrio, he said, referring to the low-income Spanish-speaking neighborhoods where most of the Albuquerque gangs are based.
Many of you may be thinking, I'm so glad this doesn't apply to me.
My son spends his evenings upstairs in his bedroom.
But the differences between your son in the suburbs and these boys in the barrio are not as big as you might think.
The biggest difference may be that the boy in the barrio is engaging in actual violence with a real gun.
Your son, upstairs playing Grand Theft Auto or Call of Duty, is engaging in pretend violence with a pretend gun.
But the underlying dynamic is the same.
In both cases, the boy is less concerned about achievement in the real world, at school, and more concerned about carrying out his mission, in the video game or in the world of the gang, and impressing his comrades.
In both cases, the boy is trying to prove to his friends and to himself that he is a real man.
Boys want to become men and to see themselves as men.
If we don't give them better guidance about how to do that in a constructive way, they will look to their peers.
The result may be gang-related violence for boys who find themselves living in the barrio.
In more affluent settings, the result may be boys who spend many hours a week playing violent video games.
In the final chapter, I will have more to say about what we can do, individually and as a society, to help boys become good men.
The Ruling of the Court
We have already seen that boys are at least twice as likely as girls to play violent video games.
And there is now evidence that violent video games, such as Grand Theft Auto and Call of Duty, have effects that are qualitatively different from those of non-violent games, such as Zuma and Tetris.
Young people who play violent video games change their brains, becoming desensitized to violence, in ways not seen in young people who play non-violent video games.
The more realistic the violence, the bigger the effects.
Playing violent video games over a period of months and years appears to cause more aggressive behavior and more aggressive thoughts and feelings, as well as decreased empathy.
That's not true for playing non-violent video games.
Boys who spend many hours each week playing violent video games are at increased risk of disengaging from the real world.
One of the most highly regarded researchers in this field, Professor Craig Anderson, has pointed out that the strength of the evidence linking violent video games to antisocial behaviors is every bit as strong as the evidence linking second-hand smoke to lung cancer or lead poisoning in infancy to lower IQ scores.
Professor Anderson also notes that the controversy now surrounding video games is reminiscent of the controversy surrounding cigarette smoking in the 1960s or lead poisoning in the 1970s.
After all, many smokers will never get lung cancer.
And some people who get lung cancer are not smokers and have never been exposed to cigarette smoke.
Likewise, not all boys who play video games 20 hours a week will disengage from real life, and not all boys who disengage from real life are video game players.
But Professor Anderson insists that we not ignore the significant risks that video games create.
Legislators in California heard about this research.
They were especially concerned by the studies showing that playing the most violent video games can change personality in children and teenagers, causing kids to become less caring and more hostile.
They thought, there ought to be a law.
So they wrote a law, making it a civil offense, punishable by a fine of up to $1,000, for stores to sell the most violent video games directly to children under 18.
Parents, if they chose, could still purchase violent games and give them to their children to play.
But the law would prohibit a kid from walking into a store and buying the most violent games without his parents' knowledge.
Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger signed the statute into law.
But it never took effect.
The video game industry, supported by the American Civil Liberties Union, ACLU, promptly brought suit.
The industry and the ACLU claimed that the California law violated the video game company's First Amendment right of free speech.
The case went to the United States Supreme Court.
In a decision written by the late Justice Antonin Scalia, the court ruled in favor of the video game industry,
rendering the California statute null and void.
In a concurring opinion, Justice Samuel Alito expressed his concerns about violent video games.
He agreed with the California state legislators that
the experience of playing video games and the effects on minors of playing violent video games
may be very different from anything that we have seen before.
He expressed his horror at video games in which
victims by the dozens are killed with every imaginable implement,
including machine guns, shotguns, clubs, hammers, axes, swords, and chainsaws.
Victims are dismembered, decapitated, disemboweled, set on fire, and chopped into little pieces.
They cry out in agony and beg for mercy.
Blood gushes, splatters, and pools.
Severed body parts and gobs of human remains are graphically shown.
In some games, points are awarded based not only on the number of victims killed,
but on the killing technique employed.
Justice Alito understood the concerns of the legislators
and of the parents who had campaigned for the bill.
But he joined Justice Scalia in ruling that deciding what games children will play
is not the job of the California State Assembly.
It's the job of the parents.
There is no law prohibiting any child from buying any video game,
no matter how violent or vicious the game may encourage the player to be.
There can't be such a law, not in the United States,
as a result of the Supreme Court's ruling.
No one else can do this job for you.
You must know what games your child is playing.
There should be no expectation of privacy when your son is playing a video game.
You should be looking over his shoulder to make sure that the game meets safe criteria.
We will talk about those criteria in just a moment.
If your son is going to a friend's house,
you must ask whether they will be playing video games,
and if so, then you must find out whether the parents share your concerns about violent video games.
If the parents have no idea what you are talking about,
or if they won't even be home,
then you must tell your son,
no, you are not allowed to go to that friend's house.
And what about preparing for the real world?
The demands of real life require skills quite different from the skills required to master video games.
Imagine a young father in his 20s, let's say,
trying to comfort his crying baby daughter.
There are no buttons to push,
no photon torpedoes to fire.
The right thing to do may be simply to rock the baby and hum a lullaby.
The chief virtue required may not be lightning virtuosity with a game controller,
but merely patience.
If you need to get along with a belligerent co-worker,
the chief virtue you need may not be blazing speed, but patience.
In most video games,
the best way to deal with difficult people
is to vaporize them with rocket-propelled grenades.
In the real world,
what you need most is not high-tech lethal weaponry,
but patience.
The stereotypical pastimes of boys and men in previous generations
were pretty good at teaching skills like patience.
Thirty years ago, and even more so fifty years ago,
it was more common for boys and men to go hunting and fishing together.
Boys who go fishing with an experienced fisherman
soon learn that a good fisherman has to be able to wait patiently.
That sort of patience might serve a young father well.
But video games do not teach that kind of patience.
So what rules should you lay down for your son?
Professor Anderson has provided some practical guidelines
based on the published research.
He recommends first of all
that you either play the game yourself
or watch it being played.
Then, ask yourself these questions.
Does the game involve some characters trying to harm others?
Does this happen frequently,
more than once or twice in thirty minutes?
Is the harm rewarded in any way?
Is the harm portrayed as humorous?
Are non-violent solutions absent or less fun than the violent ones?
Are realistic consequences of violence absent from the game?
If you answer yes to two or more of these questions,
then Professor Anderson suggests
that your son should not be allowed to play the game.
The first consideration should not be
how many hours per day or per week
your son is allowed to play these games.
The first question should be
what kind of video games he is allowed to play at all.
Violent video games that reward antisocial aggression,
games such as Grand Theft Auto,
should not be permitted in the house.
Period.
Antisocial aggression means
aggression such as killing police officers or prostitutes,
aggression that runs counter to all acceptable social behavior.
Another consideration that I mentioned earlier
is what activities are displaced by playing video games.
If your son is neglecting his friendships
with non-gamer friends
to spend more time playing video games,
then he's spending too much time playing video games.
If he refuses to sit down to dinner with the family
because he's in the middle of a video game,
that's not acceptable.
He needs some help from you
getting his priorities straight.
And what about teenage boys
having relationships with girls?
Surprisingly, especially to those of us over 30,
many boys today seem to prefer playing video games
to being with girls.
Mr. Welsh, a teacher at T.C. Williams High School
in Alexandria, Virginia,
has heard any number of stories along these lines.
Girls at his school have told him
that at parties they
are often totally ignored
as the guys gather around TV screens
entranced by one video game or another.
Girls sit around watching the guys play
until they get fed up
and drive off looking for something else to do,
says junior Sarah Kell,
for whom the games range from
stupid and boring to disgusting.
We try to tell them they're wasting their time,
but they just keep going.
Some guys stay up playing
until three in the morning on school nights,
and then they try to do their homework.
Boys prefer video games over girls?
A reporter for the New York Times
spoke with students
at a number of college campuses.
She discovered many young men
who seemed more interested
in playing their video games
than in being with their girlfriends.
The reporter interviewed
one young woman in college
who had broken off her relationship
with a young man
in part out of frustration
over his playing video games
four hours a day.
He said he was thinking
of trying to cut back
to 15 hours a week, she said.
I said,
15 hours is what I spend
on my internship
and I get paid $1,300 a month.
That's my litmus test now.
I won't date anyone
who plays video games.
It means they're choosing
to do something
that wastes their time
and sucks the life out of them.
A young man in college today
has unprecedented sexual opportunities.
Unlike his father or grandfather,
he is likely to be attending
a school where men
are outnumbered by women.
Even boys who are not
the best looking
or particularly popular
now have an excellent chance
of finding young women
who will accept their advances.
Nevertheless,
as the New York Times reported
in a front page story,
college administrators
are reporting
that more and more young men
show no interest
in meeting young women
or meeting other men
for that matter.
They don't want to meet anybody.
They just want to
stay in their rooms,
talk to no one,
and play video games
into the wee hours.
Some miss class
until they withdraw
or flunk out.
Here are guidelines
for the appropriate use
of video games
based especially
on the work of
Professor Craig Anderson
cited previously.
Content
You should not allow
your son to play
video games
in which the player
is rewarded
for killing police officers
or non-combatant civilians.
The video game industry
itself provides
a rating system
for games
assigning a rating
of M for Mature
to this kind
of antisocial violence.
M games are not
supposed to be sold
to or used
by anyone
under 18 years of age.
But just because
a game is rated
T for Teen
doesn't guarantee
that it's appropriate
for your son.
Familiarize yourself
with the T-rated games.
Even games rated E
for everyone
cannot be assumed
to be safe.
In fact,
Professor Anderson's team
has found that
some of the E-rated games
were more violent
and engendered
more violent behaviors
than some games
rated T.
Time
No more than
40 minutes a night
on school nights
and no more than
one hour a day
on other days.
And that's only
after homework
and household chores
have been completed.
And your minutes
do not roll over.
If your son goes
three weeks
without playing
any video games
at all,
that doesn't mean
that he's allowed
to spend eight hours
on a Saturday
playing video games.
That's binge gaming,
analogous to binge drinking,
and it's unhealthy.
Activities Displaced
Make sure your son
knows where his
priorities should be.
Family comes first,
schoolwork and household
chores come second,
friends come third,
video games are
somewhere further
down the list.
If your family
is one in which
most family members
still sit down
to share a common
evening meal,
then sitting down
to dinner with the family
should be more important
than playing a video game,
more important
than talking on the phone
with a friend,
more important even
than finishing
a homework assignment.
Homework is more
important than
talking with friends
or playing a video game.
Taking a phone call
from a friend
should be a higher
priority than
playing out a video game,
though.
I'm not quitting
Governing and guiding
your son's use
of video games
is a good idea,
but it's only
half the challenge.
You want to help
find a constructive
alternative.
In some cases,
competitive sports
might provide
such an outlet.
What kind of
free-time activities
and hobbies
would be the best
choice for this
kind of boy?
How can this
particular boy
best satisfy
his desire
to be tested
and to triumph?
Let me share
with you the
experience of
one of my own
patients.
At age 12,
Aaron Grossman
was an avid
video game player.
His behavior
bordered on addiction.
One key
characteristic
of addiction,
incidentally,
is loss of control.
The boy knows
that he shouldn't
be spending
so much time
playing video games
he may not even
want to play
that much.
But he feels
that he just
can't help it.
So,
Aaron was spending
three or four
hours a day
playing video games,
mostly sports
games like
Madden NFL.
When his parents
asked him whether
he'd like to try
playing real football,
though,
he said no.
He wasn't
interested.
His mom and dad,
Jennifer and David,
decided to sign
Aaron up for
football anyway,
Pop Warner
football.
They didn't ask
Aaron,
they just told him
that he was going
to play.
I've found that
parents can do
this kind of
compulsory sign-up
for a boy
only up to
about age 12
or maybe age 13,
but generally
no later.
If you drive
a 16-year-old boy
to an activity
he doesn't want
to attend,
he may simply
get out of the car
and walk away.
But Aaron's parents
judged correctly
that their son
was still young enough
to go to the practice
on their say-so.
Once Aaron was
surrounded by other
boys who were doing
their best to run,
kick, throw,
and catch,
he joined in.
After all,
the format of
the first day
of Pop Warner
football isn't
much different
from gym class
at school.
It's familiar.
On the drive
back home
that first day,
Jennifer wisely
did not ask
whether Aaron
had a good time.
Asking whether
Aaron had a good
time would have
been very nearly
equivalent to
asking him to
admit he was wrong
and his parents
were right.
Instead,
she just said,
practice tomorrow
starts at 11 a.m.,
right?
He nodded.
The practices
were every day,
Monday through Friday,
sometimes lasting
several hours.
It was hot.
The second week,
the boys put on
their equipment,
helmets,
shoulder pads,
the whole deal.
Mom gasped the first
time she saw another
boy knock Aaron
to the ground.
But Aaron got up
immediately and trotted
back to where the
coach was explaining
the next drill.
The next day was
the first scrimmage.
Aaron was knocked
down several times,
one time pretty hard.
It was a hot,
muggy August day.
On the ride home,
Aaron was visibly
flushed and tired.
After driving in silence
for several minutes,
his mom finally said,
Aaron, if you want
to quit, it's okay.
Dad and I appreciate
your making an effort.
Aaron shook his head.
Coach can kick me
off the team if he wants
to, he said,
but I'm not quitting.
The words were so corny,
so reminiscent of
Richard Gere's line
to Louis Gossett Jr.
in An Officer and a Gentleman
that Mom almost laughed.
But then she realized
that her son had probably
never seen an officer
and a gentleman.
He was serious.
Aaron stopped playing
video games altogether
during football season.
When the season ended
in November and his team
didn't make the playoffs,
he said,
maybe next year.
He started playing
Madden NFL again,
on and off,
after the season ended,
but seldom more than
30 minutes a day.
It's nothing like
the real thing,
he told his mom
spontaneously one day.
That's the closest
he ever came
to thanking his parents
for signing him up
for real-world football.
Insight or not
When psychologists say
that a client
has good insight,
they mean that the client
understands the situation
and has a good grasp
of what needs to be done.
Some boys have insight
into their video game
predicament.
Others do not.
Jacob did not.
Jacob Stolzfuss
was 22 years old
when his parents
brought him to see me
in the office.
Although he had
above-average intelligence,
he had been a mediocre
student in high school.
He barely managed
to graduate.
He now worked
a few hours a week
assisting his father,
who worked as an
independent contractor
doing home remodeling.
His parents were concerned
by Jacob's complete
lack of ambition.
He had no job
except for the occasional
work provided
by his father,
no education
beyond high school,
and no interest
in further education,
vocational or otherwise,
and no plans
for the future.
His parents were also
concerned about his
lack of any social life.
He had no girlfriend,
indeed,
no friends at all.
The four of us
met together,
Jacob,
his parents,
and me.
His parents spoke first.
I've been researching
it online,
and I'm worried,
his mom said.
He has no ambition,
no friends,
and no concern
about any of it.
I looked it up online,
and more than one site
mentioned the possibility
of schizophrenia.
I nodded,
although schizophrenia
seemed unlikely.
After listening to the parents
for a few more minutes,
I turned to Jacob.
What's your favorite thing
to do in your free time?
I asked him.
He snorted.
What do you think?
He said.
I don't know.
That's why I asked you.
I said.
Well, it depends.
He said.
Jerking off is number one
if I haven't done it
in a day or two,
but you can't jerk off
all day long.
Believe me,
I've tried to more than once.
So, when I'm not jerking off,
I play video games.
For readers outside
of North America,
jerking off
is slang for masturbating.
How many hours a day
do you spend
playing video games?
I asked.
Another snort.
As many as possible,
he said.
How about in the past
seven days?
I asked.
The four of us
then worked through
the past seven days
going over
what Jacob had done
each day
as near as they could recall.
We concluded
that he had spent
at least 40 hours
in the past seven days
playing video games.
It was the equivalent
of a full-time job.
His favorite games
were violent games
such as Halo,
World of Warcraft,
Grand Theft Auto,
and Assassin's Creed.
Do you see a problem there?
I asked Jacob.
None whatsoever,
he said
with a charming smile.
Who are your best friends?
I asked.
I have dozens.
Where do you want me to start?
He answered.
Just tell me
the first names
of three of your best friends.
Their names
or their gamer handles?
Preferably a real name,
I said.
Well, there's Jonathan,
he said.
When did you last see Jonathan?
I asked.
I've never seen Jonathan,
Jacob said.
He lives in Singapore.
He's in my World of Warcraft guild.
When's the last time
you had a friend
over at your house?
I asked.
Yeah, I see
what you're getting at.
The virtual world
isn't as good
as the real world, right?
That's what you think, right?
Jacob said.
Yes, that's fair, I said.
I do think
real world relationships
are more important
than relationships
which exist only online
or in a virtual world.
So,
when's the last time
you had a friend
over at your house?
No response from Jacob.
It's been a long time,
his mom said
after a pause.
Years,
his father said.
After another
forty minutes
of evaluation,
I was ready
to make a recommendation.
I don't see
any evidence
that Jacob
has schizophrenia
or any other
major psychiatric disorder,
I said,
and he doesn't appear
to be either
anxious or depressed.
I think
that the time
he spends
playing video games
and other online activities
has displaced
his real world activities.
He's spending
too much time
in front of
an electronic screen.
That's what I think, too,
his father said.
But what can we do
about it?
If Jacob
were younger,
if he were
ten years old
instead of
twenty-two years old,
then it might be
reasonable
to impose
some limits.
If he were
ten years old,
you could allow him
to play video games
for maybe
thirty or forty
minutes a day.
But that won't
work at this age
in my experience.
Why not?
Mom asked.
I turned to Jacob.
If your parents
were to limit
your video games
to forty minutes a day,
would you turn off
the game
after forty minutes?
Another snort.
No way,
he said.
I'm just getting
started after forty minutes.
That's what I thought,
I said.
And if you try
to turn off the game
in the middle of a game,
a man twenty-two years
of age can get upset.
That's an understatement,
Jacob said.
And for the first time,
all three of them,
Jacob and his parents,
laughed.
Right,
I said.
The only effective
intervention in this context,
with a man twenty-two
years of age who is
spending more than
forty hours a week
playing video games,
is complete abstinence.
You have to eliminate
all access to video games.
Jacob's face
froze.
You mean we have
to remove the
Xbox?
His mother asked.
Remove the Xbox
from the house.
Destroy it or
give it away.
Eliminate all access
to video games,
including the cell phone.
Jacob's face
unfroze,
changing into
an angry grimace.
That's totally
unacceptable,
he said.
I'm an adult.
I'm over eighteen.
You can't tell me
what to do.
My parents can't
tell me what to do.
That's true,
I said.
You are an adult.
You are free to
walk out of your
parents' house and
make your own way
in the world.
But if you leave,
and now I turned
to the parents,
if you leave,
your parents are
not to support you.
You are on your own.
Right now you are
living in your
parents' home,
but you are not
paying your way.
You don't pay rent.
They pay for your
food.
They pay for your
internet access.
If you are going
to stay in their
house, then you
have to abide by
their rules.
With my encouragement,
the parents followed
my instructions.
They donated the
Xbox and all the
video games they
could find in the
house to Goodwill.
They took away
their son's cell phone.
They removed the
computer from his
room.
They password-protected
their own computer
and refused their
son access to their
computer except under
supervision.
Four weeks later,
they were back as I
had requested.
It's unbelievable the
difference, Dad said.
What's different?
I asked.
Everything is different,
Dad said.
At work, for example,
it used to be pulling
teeth to get Jacob to
help me at all and I
had to check everything
he did.
But now he's showing
initiative.
And to be blunt,
he's a lot smarter than
I thought he was.
How do you mean?
I asked.
Well, take this past
week, for example,
Dad said.
We were doing an
upscale remodeling job.
The homeowner wanted
us to install this
high-tech shower unit
with massage jets,
body jets, everything,
all voice-controlled
by computer.
I didn't want to tell
the owner the truth,
which is that I had
never done anything
like it.
I was struggling.
Jacob stepped right in,
showed me how to do it,
and did most of the
wiring himself.
He figured it out just
by reading the
instructions.
The unit worked
perfectly.
It was impressive.
Jacob was staring down
at the floor, but I
thought I saw a hint of
a smile on his face.
It wasn't easy, his mom
said.
Not at first.
Jacob didn't talk to us
at all for the first
week.
He would make his own
meals and take them
into his room.
But then, after about a
week, he started joining
us for supper.
And he just seemed to
wake up.
It was as though he had
been in a fog all those
years he was playing
video games.
Maybe he just wasn't
getting enough sleep.
Now he actually talks
at suppertime.
He just seems smarter
now.
He understands better.
He's got a better
attention span.
He's got more patience,
Dad said.
What do you think?
I asked Jacob.
Do you agree?
No, I don't, Jacob said.
I don't feel any
different.
Not any smarter, that's
for sure.
If it were up to you,
would you start playing
video games again tomorrow?
I asked.
Absolutely, Jacob said.
His parents sighed.
Jacob showed no insight,
no awareness of how his
video games had displaced
real-world activities.
Jacob started playing
video games regularly
when he was five years
old.
His parents were impressed
by his skill and manual
dexterity playing the
games.
They were misled.
Researchers find that
the younger the age when
boys start playing video
games, the more likely
they are to become
addicted, to sacrifice
real-world activities in
order to play their game.
As you consider how to
implement the guidelines
I have shared in this
chapter, you also need to
take into consideration
the age of your child.
The younger the child, the
less time they should
spend in front of a screen
and the more time they
should spend in the real
world.
That's equally true for
girls and for boys.
Don't wait for your son to
show insight into his
situation.
I have seen many parents
who expect their 11 or 15
or 24-year-old son to act
logically on the basis of
the evidence.
The parents will say,
Look how much time video
games are sucking out of
your life.
See how your friendships
have withered since you
started spending 20 hours a
week in front of a screen?
See how tired you are all
the time, except when you
were playing the game?
Parents consider these
points compelling.
They expect their son to
have insight and to act
based on the evidence.
Don't wait.
You may be waiting months,
years.
If your son is one of the
millions of boys and
young men who have allowed
video games to displace
real life, you must
intervene.
Remove the device if
necessary.
Limit screen time.
If you don't, who will?
Chapter 9.
Gender Nonconforming
Martin
Sally first realized she was
pregnant while sitting in the
office of her divorce lawyer.
She'd been married for four
years and she was at the end of
her rope.
Even though she worked longer
hours than Mark and brought
home more money, Mark still
expected her to be the
housekeeper, picking up his
clothes, cleaning house,
cooking all the meals.
He even had the nerve to
complain when supper was late,
when he'd been home all
afternoon watching TV while
she worked her tail off at the
bank.
She'd suggested marriage
counseling.
Mark refused.
He didn't have the slightest
clue how badly the marriage was
broken and apparently had no
interest in fixing it.
A friend at work gave her the
name of a good divorce lawyer.
At the first visit, the lawyer was
going through a checklist of
questions.
Any children?
The lawyer asked.
No, Sally answered.
Any possibility that you might
be pregnant at this time?
Sally was about to answer,
no, of course not.
But then she paused.
When had she had her last
period?
For that matter, when was the
last time she and Mark...
Then she remembered that
Saturday night more than a
month ago when she had thought
that just maybe this marriage
could still be saved.
That moment in the attorney's
office was the first time she
realized that her period was
late.
I don't think so, Sally answered
at last.
You don't think so?
The attorney repeated
quizzically.
Eight months later, she gave
birth to Martin.
In the meantime, Mark had moved
to Los Angeles and Sally was
contemplating life as a single
mother.
Many parents imagine that their
children are above average, but
Sally was sure that Martin was
precocious, and she was right.
By one year of age, Martin had a
vocabulary of about twenty words,
including zebra.
By age two, he was talking in full
sentences.
By age four, he was sounding out
words in the phonics workbook.
When he started kindergarten, the
teacher immediately put him in the
accelerated reading group.
Martin was the only boy in that
group of six children.
From the beginning, Martin loved
school.
He always sat in the front row,
raised his hand to answer every
question, was always polite.
His teachers adored him.
If all boys were like Martin, life
would be a joy, said Mrs.
Messner, his first grade teacher,
wistfully.
I just wish he would go outside at
recess.
Martin doesn't go outside at recess?
Sally asked.
Lately, no, Mrs.
Messner said.
He begged me.
He said, Mrs.
Messner, why should I waste time
going outside and just standing
around?
Why can't I just stay inside and
read?
He just doesn't like recess.
All the other boys are running
around like wild animals, and Martin
stays close by me or one of the other
teachers.
I was like that, too, Sally said.
I never liked recess.
By the end of third grade, Martin was
reading at the sixth grade level.
He started writing poetry, taking
great care in the arrangement of
words on the page.
His favorite font on the computer was
French script.
His handwriting flowered into an
elaborate cursive, and he began making
little circles for the dots over I and
J.
Sally's friends warned her that Martin
was becoming a bookworm.
She should sign him up for some sports,
they said.
That sounded like a good idea.
What would you like to play?
She asked her son.
Soccer?
Basketball?
Football?
I don't like any of those, he said.
Pause.
But I do like bowling with Karen and
Samantha, he added at last.
Bowling's not a sport, Sally said.
Yes, it is, Martin said.
They have tournaments on TV.
Finally, Martin agreed to take some
tennis lessons, but his heart wasn't in
it.
My schedule is too busy, nine-year-old
Martin announced to Sally one day a
few weeks after the tennis lessons
began.
I need more time to practice piano.
The tennis lessons are a waste of time
and money.
Martin could be very firm, especially
when negotiating with his mother.
All right, Sally said.
No more tennis lessons.
What was the point of spending money on
something that Martin didn't even like?
At least he has friends, Sally thought.
She and Martin agreed on eight children to
invite over for his tenth birthday party.
Seven girls and one boy, as it happened.
Martin wanted the party to have a Lord of the
Rings theme.
Martin claimed that all of his friends liked
the Lord of the Rings.
Sally asked her son which character he
liked the most.
Frodo, of course, Martin said.
Really?
Why, of course, Sally asked.
Why not Gandalf or Legolas or Aragorn?
Aragorn is a very unrealistic character,
Martin said dismissively.
Frodo is much more believable.
But Aragorn at least is a human being,
Sally answered, determined to win one of
these debates for once.
Frodo is a four-foot-tall hobbit.
How can you say Frodo is more realistic
than Aragorn?
Because Aragorn is so strong, so great at
everything, it's just not believable.
He's always fighting off somebody evil,
orcs or Uruk-hai or Nazgul, whatever.
And he always wins against ridiculously long
odds, her son said.
It's just not plausible.
Frodo is weak.
He's small.
He doesn't fight anybody, except Gollum at
the very end, and Gollum is even smaller
and weaker than Frodo is.
And anyhow, Frodo basically lost that fight.
Gollum bit the ring off his hand.
Sally wanted to compliment her not-quite-ten-year-old
son on using the word plausible correctly
in a sentence, but she paused as she considered
the implications of what Martin had just said.
Being strong and talented was unrealistic,
according to Martin.
Winning against long odds was unrealistic.
Being weak was realistic.
She needed to sort this out.
The court had granted sole physical custody
of Martin to Sally.
Nevertheless, Sally made a point of inviting
her ex-husband, Martin's father,
to spend time with Martin,
especially over the summer months.
Mark had mellowed and matured in the years
since the divorce.
He'd had two children by his second wife,
and he seemed to be a good father to them.
Sally suppressed the urge to ask Mark's second wife,
Jennifer, whether he had gotten any better
at helping around the house.
Mark called from California one evening
to ask Sally whether Martin could join him
and his six-year-old son, Jared,
on a fishing trip.
My company is chartering a forty-foot boat.
About a dozen people are going.
We'll sail to Catalina Island,
do some fishing out there,
then that night we'll be at sea
on the open ocean.
There's nothing like it, Sally.
The stars are so bright,
it's like they're just ten feet over your head.
It sounds like fun,
Sally said sincerely.
But Martin refused.
There's nothing more stupid than fishing,
he said authoritatively.
You sit on a boat waiting for some poor fish
to chomp down on your hook,
then you viciously yank on the hook,
which is stuck in the fish's mouth,
and then you drag the fish up on the boat
and cut out its guts.
What fun!
I don't think so.
No, thank you.
But Martin, Sally began.
Besides, I'm supposed to be at my music camp then.
Martin said.
You're not asking me to give up my music camp,
are you?
Sally and Mark continued to talk
after Martin got off the phone.
Martin doesn't want to do any regular guy things,
Mark said.
He says fishing is stupid,
even though he's never tried it.
He wouldn't go to a football game with me,
even when I had those tickets for a Redskins game
when I visited you guys last November.
He doesn't want to play soccer.
Geez, he wouldn't even play video games with me
when we went to the video arcade.
So what difference does any of that make?
Sally said defensively.
He's getting straight A's.
He has friends.
He's happy.
But what does he do for fun?
Mark asked.
He plays piano.
He writes poetry.
He reads.
You call that fun?
Mark asked incredulously.
For Martin, those things are fun.
Martin is very intellectual.
That's just who he is.
Besides, where is it written that every boy has to like football
or video games or fishing?
So what's this music camp he's going to?
Mark asked.
It's a very good music camp.
Martin really wants to work on piano over the summer.
What kind of piano music does he play?
Mark asked.
Lots of different kinds, Sally said.
Oh yeah, can he play jazz?
Fats Waller?
Keith Jarrett?
No, of course not, Sally said.
He only plays classical.
Beethoven, Clementi, Debussy.
You should hear him play Claire de Lune.
Jeez, give me a break, Mark said.
The other boys didn't really start picking on Martin until middle school.
That's when Sally began getting phone calls from the guidance counselor.
Somebody had stuffed tampons into Martin's locker with a note attached saying,
You need these.
Then a week later, somebody spray-painted the word fag on his locker.
The following month, two boys bumped into Martin in the hallway,
pretending it was an accident, and knocked him over.
Sally was horrified by the bruise on Martin's cheek where his face had hit the floor.
Doesn't it bother you that the other boys pick on you?
She asked her son.
Not really, he said with a shrug.
They don't understand me.
All they understand is video games and sports.
They're afraid of what they don't understand, and they respond the only way they know how.
With violence.
I just need to be careful.
Stay away from them, that's all.
But why don't any of your friends stand up for you?
Mom asked.
I don't have any friends, Martin said matter-of-factly.
How can you say that?
What about Karen?
What about Samantha?
Mom asked.
They're not my friends anymore, ever since the boys started picking on me.
Karen and Samantha are friends with those boys now, especially Karen.
She's always hanging out with them.
When she saw how the boys hate me, she started avoiding me.
That must hurt.
You must feel terrible, Mom said.
No, I don't.
It doesn't bother me.
Besides, I do have friends.
Really?
Mom said eagerly.
Who?
I'd say my best friends right now are Isaac Asimov and Robert Heinlein, Martin said calmly.
Mom had to pause for a moment, searching her memory to recognize the names.
But Isaac Asimov and Robert Heinlein, they're both dead, she said.
A chill ran down her spine.
They were both science fiction writers.
Right, Martin said.
Isaac Asimov wrote the Foundation trilogy.
It's about a mutant who's more powerful than all the normal people.
He looks small and weak, but he's actually stronger than anybody because of his special powers.
Robert Heinlein wrote Stranger in a Strange Land.
But you can't go out to lunch with them.
You can't talk to them.
You need friends you can talk to, Mom said.
Not true, Martin said.
They're my best friends.
I have tons in common with them.
The Anomalous Male
There is plenty of variation within the sexes.
Beyoncé, Angelina Jolie, Serena Williams, Martha Stewart, and Hillary Clinton don't seem to have much in common with one another.
Nor, for that matter, do Pee Wee Herman, Sylvester Stallone, Lil Wayne, Justin Bieber, and the late Michael Jackson.
But how significant are the differences?
How do those differences affect what we've discussed earlier in this book?
Let's begin with a study published by scientists at NASA who were studying astronauts on the space shuttle some years back.
One of the less well-known facts about spaceflight is that women who fly in the space shuttle are typically very dizzy after they return to Earth.
Their blood pressure tends to be lower than it should be for several days after the flight.
If they stand up too suddenly, they get dizzy because their blood pressure is too low.
The same phenomenon has been reported in male astronauts, but much less often.
Wendy Waters and Janice Meck at the Johnson Space Center in Houston wanted to study this phenomenon.
So they tested female and male astronauts right after the astronauts returned from a mission on the space shuttle.
Thirty-five astronauts in all.
Their findings confirmed what many previous reports had suggested.
Every female astronaut they tested was extremely prone to dizziness after the flight.
Few of the men were.
The stress of spaceflight had very different effects on most of the men compared with all of the women.
The extraordinary finding in this study concerned those few men who were dizzy after spaceflight.
Men who showed the female typical drop in blood pressure after spaceflight.
These men were less often pilots by training, more often mission specialists.
Biologists, physicists, or computer geeks with no background in aviation.
Men who were on board just to run a particular experiment.
Among the real astronauts, the men who fly the shuttle, the anomalous female typical pattern was rare.
But one in four male mission specialists showed the female typical pattern.
None of the females showed the male typical pattern.
Very few of the tough guys showed the female typical pattern.
But among the geeks, one out of four men showed the female typical pattern.
What's going on?
There's growing evidence that a small subset of boys and men have some characteristics that are more typical of girls and women.
That doesn't mean they're transgender.
We'll get to transgender in Chapter 11.
And it also doesn't mean they're gay.
Different researchers have used different terms for these boys and different criteria to define them,
so it's hard to consolidate the findings across the various studies.
But there's reason to believe that these boys have a lot in common.
Harvard professor Jerome Kagan spent many years studying these boys, whom I'll call anomalous males.
Kagan began by analyzing baby boys who were only a few weeks old.
He would simply touch the babies gently and see how they responded.
Most baby boys don't mind being touched, but a few react intensely.
When touched, those boys begin crying and thrashing their arms and legs.
Kagan followed these boys for years, from infancy through childhood and into adolescence.
He studied some of these kids for more than three decades.
He found, first of all, that about half of these boys never outgrow their dislike of novelty.
As teenagers, these boys shy away from strangers and new adventures, just as they did when they were babies.
Even more striking, Kagan found that these boys have other characteristics in common.
Specifically, these anomalous males are
More likely to have allergies, asthma, or eczema than other boys.
More likely to have a narrow face, that is, a facial width-to-height ratio less than 0.55.
A narrow face in males, but not in females, is associated with lower dominance and more fearfulness.
Young men with narrow faces are less aggressive and less likely to be successful in martial arts
compared with men with broader faces, even after controlling for physical size.
Less willing to engage in rough-and-tumble play
Sociologist Patricia Cayo Sexton also studied such boys.
She found other characteristics in addition to those identified by Kagan.
According to Sexton, these boys also typically
Are precocious, particularly with respect to language skills,
Are often loners with few close friends,
May enjoy sports, but typically prefer non-contact sports,
Such as tennis, track, bowling, and golf.
They don't like to hit or be hit, so they're not playing football or soccer.
I would add one more characteristic to those listed above
Based on my observations over the past 20 years.
If you give one of these boys a blank piece of paper and a box of crayons,
That boy will almost always draw a person or a pet or a tree.
In other words, he draws the same sort of picture that the girls draw.
He doesn't draw a scene of action at a moment of dynamic change,
As most other boys do.
Re-listen to chapter 2 if you don't see the significance of this.
A word about terminology
In the first edition of this book, published in 2005,
I noted that these boys were sometimes referred to as sissies.
I didn't like that term then and I don't like it now.
It's derogatory.
In this book, we are trying to understand kids,
Not mock them or make fun of them.
I preferred the term anomalous male over sissy
Because anomalous just describes the facts.
These boys are not typical boys.
In recent years, however, a new term has become the preferred term in the field,
And that term is gender non-conforming.
While I agree that we don't want to use the term sissy,
I see problems with the term gender non-conforming.
In modern American culture, being a conformist is a bad thing.
Being a non-conformist is a good thing.
Saying that one group of kids are non-conformists
And another group of kids are conformists
Is derogatory to the conformists.
The fact that the conformists are in the majority
Doesn't make it any less unfair to put a derogatory label on them.
This point is not trivial.
We will come back to it in the next two chapters.
A subtle but pervasive bias
Has infiltrated gender studies over the past decade.
A bias that allows saying unkind things about the majority
Under the guise of being kind to the minority.
But I think bias is bias.
The fact that someone is biased in favor of a minority,
In this case the anomalous male,
Doesn't excuse the bias.
It's still unfair.
Throughout this chapter,
I will continue to use the term anomalous male
To refer to the boy who draws people, pets, flowers, and trees,
Who has a narrow face,
Who doesn't like rough-and-tumble play, etc.
I prefer this term over the currently politically correct term
Gender non-conforming
Because anomalous just describes the reality,
Whereas gender non-conforming
Subtly implies that the non-conformist
Is better than the conformist.
I don't think one kind of boy
Is intrinsically better than another.
I am just trying to understand the differences.
The anomalous male, then,
Appears to represent a distinct physiological type
And is a real challenge to parents,
Who often don't even recognize
The kinds of problems their son may face.
On the contrary,
Many parents, especially mothers,
React the way Sally and Mrs. Messner did.
Martin was quiet and well-behaved
And never got into trouble.
What's not to like?
Many parents don't recognize
That their anomalous son
Is heading for a special kind of trouble.
Until middle school begins.
When the tidal wave of puberty hits,
The neatly arranged life
That seemed so stable and peaceful
In elementary school
Is often washed away.
For many of these boys,
Their closest friends
During the elementary school years
Were girls.
When puberty arrives in middle school,
Hanging out with the cool kids
Becomes intensely important to many girls,
And the anomalous male
Is not a cool guy to hang with.
So the girls are gone.
Sexton found that these boys
Often become anxious about sex
Around this time.
Some begin using pornography.
Others become depressed.
The geek may become a loner,
Finding solace in his books
And his fantasies.
I am a rock.
I am an island.
Are the words of the disturbing
Paul Simon song
That so accurately portrays
Such a boy.
I have my books
And my poetry
To protect me.
I am shielded in my armor,
Hiding in my room,
Safe within my womb.
I touch no one
And no one touches me.
Let's follow
The anomalous boy
Into high school.
His grades are good.
His social life?
Not so much.
I've seen plenty of these boys
Over the past thirty years.
All too often
They've developed
A smooth facade
That hides the hurt
They feel inside.
After all,
They have the approval
Of the adult world.
Why should they care
If other kids
Make fun of them
Or spray paint nasty words
On their locker?
As Sexton observed,
These boys are
Reluctant to acknowledge
The connection
Between school honors
And feminization.
Or to inquire
Into whether their success
Can be attributed
More to acceptance
Of female norms
Than to brilliance
Or superior intellectual endowments.
Few feel victimized.
They feel more like
Heroes and victors.
By the time
Such a boy
Is in high school
I don't know
Whether anybody
Could change him
Or broaden his horizons
Or even whether
They should try
As long as this boy
Is not feeling
Anxious or lonely.
He may grow up
To be a mission specialist
On the space shuttle
After all.
He probably won't
Be the pilot
But that's okay with him.
He'd probably prefer
To be the mission specialist.
Throughout this book
I've tried to share
My perspective
That gender is important
Gender is complicated
And gender is meaningful.
Know your child
And celebrate
The kind of boy or girl
That your child is becoming.
How to apply that perspective
In the case
Of the gender atypical boy?
The answer I give to parents
Is that you don't want
Your child's gender issues
To lead to distress
If it can be avoided.
The gender atypical boy
Can easily become
Anxious, lonely, and withdrawn.
But Jerome Kagan
And his Harvard colleagues
Presented evidence
That parents who intervene early
Can pull their anomalous son
Out of the tendency to withdraw.
Kagan suggested
That parenting style
Is a critical factor
In determining
Whether a boy outgrows
His fearful, withdrawn tendencies
Or whether he remains
Stuck in that mode.
The sons of protective parents
Who are sensitive
To their child's preferences
Are the boys
Who have the worst outcomes.
Baby boys
Who are fearful and withdrawn
Become more fearful
And withdrawn
If their parents
Shield them
From minor stresses
And injuries.
Such parents
Kagan found
Made it more
Rather than less
Difficult for the child
To control
An initial urge
To retreat from strangers
And unfamiliar events.
The equally accepting mothers
Mothers who made
Age-appropriate demands
For their sons to mix
And mingle
Helped their highly reactive infants
Tame their timidity.
Mothers who protect
Their timid infants
From frustration
And anxiety
In the hope
Of effecting a benevolent outcome
Seem to exacerbate
The infant's uncertainty
And produce the opposite effect.
In Kagan's research
When parents
Who had timid children
Also believed in being
Sensitive to a child's needs
In every case
The timid baby boy
Grew up to be
A timid, fearful child.
The Boy in the Mirror
When I was writing
The first edition of this book
Back in 2003 and 2004
I had a bit of a shock
As I read the work
Of Jerome Kagan
Patricia Cayo Sexton
And others
Who described
The anomalous male
I realized
That I was reading
About
Me
I was an anomalous male
As a child
I drew pictures
Of stationary people
And stationary dogs
Rather than scenes
Of action
I taught myself
To do macrame
I didn't like
To hit other people
I attended
A sleep-away
Summer music camp
Interlochen
Near Traverse City, Michigan
For three summers
At ages 11, 12, and 13
By the end of my third summer
At Interlochen
I knew many
Gilbert and Sullivan
Operetta songs by heart
I had lots of friends
In elementary school
Mostly girls
In middle school
The mean boys
Started calling me
Len the femme
I was precocious
In English
And creative writing
I was a loner
In high school
One of my favorite songs
Was Paul Simon's
I am a rock
My mother
Divorced my father
Three months
After I was born
And she never remarried
So there was no adult male
In the household
Many years later
When my patient
Told me about her son
Martin
And his desire
Not to miss
His summer music camp
I knew exactly
How he felt
And as a clinician
I also understood
Martin's mother's wish
To push Martin
Out of the shell
He was constructing
For himself
Sexton believed
That anomalous males
Are made
Not born
She wrote
That these boys
Problems come
From overprotective parents
And can best be remedied
Through association
With a normal adult male
Later in this chapter
We will consider
New evidence
That Sexton
May have been wrong
The differences
Between the anomalous male
And gender typical males
May be genetically programmed
At least in part
Nevertheless
I have seen
In my own clinical experience
How these boys
Can become more comfortable
With typical male activities
If they get a little push
From their parents
Or from themselves
And as a result
New horizons
Open up
Amy
Amy was the firstborn
Of two daughters
Her parents
Barbara and Howard
Didn't realize
What a tomboy Amy was
Until their second child
Zoe
Was born
Amy and Zoe
Were like night and day
Barbara told me
One day in the office
When Amy was six months old
If a stranger
Came into the room
Amy would crawl
Across the floor
And tug on the stranger's
Shoelace
Barbara continued
Zoe was so different
When Zoe was six months old
If a stranger
Came into the room
Zoe would just start
Crying and crying
Until I picked her up
Then she'd just
Bury her face
In my chest
And as they grew older
I asked
Amy was your classic tomboy
Barbara said
She was always playing
With the boys
Building forts
Throwing snowballs
Climbing trees
She loved building forts
And Zoe
I asked
Zoe was into girly things
Dolls and dress up
And baking cakes
My husband and I
Were big believers
In going against
Gender stereotypes
You know
Sure
I said
I know exactly
What you mean
So when Zoe
Was three years old
We bought her
A set of toy
Earth-moving equipment
A little dump truck
A backhoe
A front-end loader
Amy loved that
Sort of stuff
So we bought
Three brand new toys
Like that for Zoe
Did she like them
I asked
She loved them
Mom said
But she didn't use them
The way they're meant
To be used
First she put
All three vehicles
In a little circle
Facing each other
And then she put
Little ribbons
On the dump truck
That's not quite
How the dump truck
Is supposed to work
Sweetie
I remember telling her
But it's the dump truck's
Birthday
Zoe explained to me
Very patiently
And here are its
Two best friends
She said
Pointing to the backhoe
And the front-end loader
Later that afternoon
I came into her room
And she very loudly
Told me
Shush
They're sleeping
She had carefully
Laid the dump truck
The backhoe
And the front-end loader
In her bed
And drawn the covers
Up over them
So you could just
See the headlights
Of each of them
That's cute
I said
What about Amy
Right
Well you know
Mom said
Amy was talented
In sports
Competitive sports
We signed her up
For MSI
The local soccer league
She was really brave
Even when she was
Just six or seven years old
She was never
Afraid of the ball
Most of the other girls
Were but not Amy
She didn't mind
Getting bumped
Or bruised
And you know
She's built more
Solidly than Zoe
She has a stockier build
Zoe is more delicate
Maybe that's a result
Of the differences
In their interests
I suggested
Maybe if Amy
Played with dolls
While Zoe ran around
On the soccer field
Then Zoe would be
The stocky one
Maybe
Barbara said doubtfully
Zoe is often anxious
Amy is not
Amy has her act together
She knows what she wants
In school
From her friends
And from the boys
In her life
She makes whatever
Arrangements are necessary
To secure her objectives
She's an honor roll student
She's captain
Of the girls soccer team
She has a variety
Of hobbies
Including
Curiously enough
Cross stitch
And macrame
And she is popular
With the athletic crowd
At her school
Both girls and boys
But she's not
Your typical girl
Differences
A handful of scholars
Have compared
Gender atypical boys
Like Martin
With gender atypical girls
Like Amy
An important contribution
Was made
Again by Patricia
Cayo Sexton
Who found that
While the anomalous boys
Were non-competitive
Non-athletic
And fearful
The anomalous girls
Were fearless
Independent
And competitive
Girls who were bold
And daring
From ages 10 to 14
Became the most
Intellectual women
As adults
Among girls
Strangely
High intelligence
Was associated
With both
Greater masculinity
And greater femininity
Bright girls
Were more likely
Than other girls
To be dominant
And striving
And at the same time
Have more feminine qualities
Boys with many
Feminine characteristics
Tend to be less popular
And at higher risk
For anxiety
And depression
Especially in middle school
And high school
By contrast
The anomalous girl
Appears more likely
Than her peers
To be popular
And well-adjusted
The girl who is
The captain
Of the lacrosse team
Is more likely
To be a top student
Than the girl
Who plays no sports
The tomboy
The girl who prefers
Some male-typical activities
Should be encouraged
To pursue those
Gender-atypical activities
Girls who show
Some male-typical characteristics
Such as a willingness
To confront others openly
Generally do better
Than average socially
On the other hand
Boys who show
Female-typical characteristics
Such as a reluctance
To engage
In rough-and-tumble play
Are more likely
To have more problems
Socially
Anomalous girls
Have an advantage
In school
And in life
Their social horizons
Are likely to be broader
Than those of other girls
Anomalous boys
Have an advantage
In school
But they pay
A steep price
For that advantage
And their social horizons
Are likely to be narrower
Than those of other boys
Is it blue
Or is it periwinkle
Back in chapter 2
We considered differences
In the visual systems
Of girls and boys
I mentioned there
That girls
May have more resources
In the visual system
That are devoted
To color and detail
While boys
May have more resources
In the visual system
That are devoted
To detecting speed
And direction of movement
I provide more information
About this topic
In the extra stuff
On vision
At the end of the book
But do those differences
Apply to gender
Anomalous girls
And boys?
Would they apply
To a girl like Amy
Or a boy like Martin?
One study
That bears on this question
Was conducted
By researchers
At Auburn University
They began by asking
College women
To complete a 59-item
Femininity questionnaire
Do you enjoy
Putting on makeup?
How often do you read
Women's magazines
Like Glamour
And Cosmopolitan?
Some of the young women
Scored high
They were the girly girls
Other women
Had low scores
On femininity
Let's call them
The tomboys
The researchers
Then showed
College students
One by one
A series of colors
Say a swath
Of lime green
They then asked
The college students
To match the color
To the correct word
Or phrase
Lime green
Mint green
Jade
Or emerald
Many of the young men
Struggled with this task
But the girly girls
Aced it
They got nearly
All the challenges
Correct
How about the tomboys?
Did they score as well
As the girly girls?
Did they score
Like the boys?
Or were they
Somewhere in between?
When I give presentations
And I pose this question
And ask for a show of hands
Most people guess
That the tomboys
Scored in between
The young men
And the young women
But that's not correct
The tomboys
Did just as well
As the girly girls
If you listen
To the material
At the end of the book
In the section titled
Extra Stuff
Sex Differences in Vision
Then this result
Won't be surprising
For girls
The difference
Between lime green
And emerald green
Is obvious
And that's true
Whether the girl
Is a tomboy
Or a girly girl
Boys can learn
The difference
Between lime green
And emerald green
But the distinction
Is less obvious
For the average boy
Than for the average girl
On this parameter
Tomboys have more
In common
With girly girls
Than they have
In common
With boys
We have seen
That gender atypical boys
Share many traits
In common
With one another
That they do not share
With gender typical boys
Gender atypical boys
Are less likely
To enjoy playing
Contact sports
Like football
They are more likely
To have a narrow face
They are more likely
To have allergies
Or asthma
And they are more likely
To draw people
Pets or plants
Compared with
Gender typical boys
No such distinctions
Apply to gender
Atypical girls
If you give
A blank piece of paper
And a box of crayons
To a tomboy
As I have done
On many occasions
She will usually
Draw a person
Or a pet
The person she draws
May be a soccer player
But unless she has
Had formal training
As an artist
That soccer player
Is standing still
Holding the ball
And not engaged
In action
The tomboy girl
Uses just as many crayons
Or nearly as many
As the girly girl
The tomboy
Chooses to draw
An athlete
While the girly girl
Chooses to draw
A ballerina
So what they draw
Is different
But how they draw
Is very similar
On this parameter
And others
The distinctions
Between the tomboy girl
And the girly girl
Seem fairly superficial
By contrast
The distinctions
Between the gender
Typical boy
And the gender
Anomalous boy
Are profound
Not only do they draw
Completely different things
But they draw them
Differently
The gender
Typical boy
Is drawing a rocket
Smashing into a planet
Or a warrior
Killing an alien
With a laser
The gender
Anomalous boy
Is drawing a person
Or a pet
Stationary
Not engaged
In action
And the differences
Go deeper still
The gender
Atypical boy
Who hates
Playing football
And who draws
Pictures of people
With eyes
Mouth
Hair
And clothes
Rather than
Stick figures
Seldom transforms
In a month
Or a year
Into a football player
Who draws
Stick figures
Engaging in combat
There may be
Exceptions to this rule
But the exceptions
Are rare
Most likely
Fewer than one
Boy in a hundred
With girls
It's different
The tomboy
Who likes to play
Football with the boys
May next week
Be a girly girl
Who wants to dress up
For the prom
Next week
Maybe even tonight
In my first-hand
Experience
It's not rare
For the same girl
To be both
A tomboy
Who likes to play
Contact sports
And a girly girl
Who loves to wear
Makeup
And get dressed up
For the prom
It's not the norm
But it's not rare
And in my experience
Such girls
Who are both
Girly girls
And tomboys
Are becoming
More common
Gender atypical girls
May always
Have been more common
Than gender atypical boys
The proportion
Of girls
Who want to play
Soccer
Or climb trees
Is usually higher
Than the proportion
Of boys
Who want to sew
Or learn to do ballet
And the proportion
Of gender atypical girls
Appears to be rising
So much so
That it's no longer
Unusual
For a girl
To play soccer
Or basketball
Which was not true
Forty or fifty years ago
But it's still unusual
To find boys
Who want to sew
Or learn ballet
Why might that
Be the case?
I will suggest
In a moment
That gender atypical
Girls and boys
Are the way they are
Because that characteristic
Is hardwired
Indeed
The tendency
Toward gender
Nonconformity
May be
Genetically programmed
I have also
Hinted above
That the trait
Of gender
Nonconformity
In boys
Is different
From and
More hardwired
Than the trait
Of gender
Nonconformity
In girls
More evidence
On this point
In just a moment
But like many
Genetically programmed
Traits
The expression
Of these traits
Is susceptible
To cultural influences
Over the past
Thirty years
And especially
In the decades
Since the publication
Of the first edition
Of Why Gender Matters
There has been
A growing cultural bias
In favor of kids
Being gender atypical
At least for girls
Today
Girls are encouraged
To play contact sports
To play in the mud
And get dirty
To engage in
Rough and tumble sports
To an extent
That would have
Amazed our parents
Yet it's still rare
To find boys
Receiving much
Encouragement
To knit
Or do macrame
Or learn ballet
That may explain
In part
Why girly girls
Who are also
Tomboys
May be more
Common today
Than they were
Forty or fifty years ago
Whereas boys
Who knit samplers
And also play football
Are no more
Common today
Than they were
In the past
But there is more
To this story
Genetic factors
Play a larger role
In boys
Than in girls
The androgen receptor
Androgens
Are hormones
Such as testosterone
That are found
In much higher
Concentrations
In men
Than in women
Male sex
Characteristics
Such as facial hair
A large Adam's apple
Deeper voice
Greater muscularity
And greater aggressiveness
Have all been linked
To androgens
Such as testosterone
But how do
Androgens work?
The answer begins
With the androgen receptor
Androgens
Such as testosterone
And dihydrotestosterone
Bind to the androgen receptor
Which becomes activated
The activated androgen receptor
Then binds to certain genes
And turns them on
Resulting in masculinization
That process begins in the womb
The male fetus
Produces testosterone
Which masculinizes
The male brain
The biggest sex differences
In the expression of genes
In the human brain
Occurs not in adulthood
Nor in puberty
But in the prenatal period
Before the baby is even born
So far so good
Girls and boys are different
But some of the most startling discoveries
Of recent years
Have helped scientists
To understand variations
Among girls
And among boys
Better than before
Researchers now understand
That the gene
For the androgen receptor
Varies from one boy
To the next
Every gene
Is made up of units
Called codons
Each codon
Normally codes
For one amino acid
In the protein
That gene
Is programmed to make
One end of the
Androgen receptor gene
Has a series of codons
Called CAG codons
Because the codons
Are a repeating string
Of cytosine
C
Adenine
A
And guanine
G
These codons
Used to be called
Nonsense codons
Because they don't
Directly code
For amino acids
But nobody calls them
Nonsense codons anymore
Because scientists
Now recognize
That these CAG codons
Help determine
How active
The androgen receptor
Will be
The number
Of CAG codon
Repeats
In the androgen
Receptor gene
Varies
From one person
To the next
From a low
Of 8 repeats
To a high
Of 31 repeats
Many research teams
Have now discovered
That if you're a boy
And your androgen
Receptor gene
Has a low number
Of CAG repeats
Then your androgen
Receptor is very active
And you will tend
To be more masculine
If you're a boy
And your androgen
Receptor gene
Has a high number
Of CAG repeats
Then your androgen
Receptor is less active
And you will tend
To be less masculine
This new research
Helps to explain
Much of the noise
In earlier research
On testosterone levels
Two young men
May have exactly
The same testosterone
Level
Yet one young man
Is very masculine
He plays football
He is aggressive
He is muscular
And the other young man
Hates football
Is timid
And is not muscular
The same testosterone
Molecule may cause
Lots of activity
Via the androgen
Receptor in the first
Young man
And much less activity
Via the androgen
Receptor in the second
Young man
In recent years
There has been
Substantial research
Linking variation
In CAG repeats
With behavioral outcomes
Such as
Aggressiveness
Impulsiveness
And depression
That research
Helps to broaden
And deepen
Earlier research
On testosterone levels
And various behavioral outcomes
For example
What's the relationship
Between testosterone levels
And depression
In adult men
It turns out
That the answer
Depends critically
On the number
Of CAG repeats
In the androgen
Receptor gene
If you're a man
And you have
A low number
Of CAG repeats
Which means
That you are likely
A very masculine man
Then your mood
Depends on testosterone
In one study
Among men
With a low number
Of CAG repeats
Depression was more
Than five times
As common
Among men
With low testosterone
Than among men
With high testosterone
But among men
With a high number
Of CAG repeats
Men who will be
On average
Less masculine men
There was no difference
In the frequency
Of depression
Between men
With low testosterone
Levels
And those with
High testosterone
Levels
Researchers have now
Documented
Many links
Between the number
Of CAG repeats
In the androgen receptor
And outcomes
Related to behavior
And personality
For example
Young men
With a low number
Of CAG repeats
Have been found
To be more impulsive
Than young men
With a high number
Of CAG repeats
And several studies
Have suggested
That men
With a smaller number
Of CAG repeats
Are more likely
To be aggressive
And to engage
In criminal violence
Independent of their
Testosterone levels
Incidentally
This link
Between the number
Of CAG repeats
And aggressiveness
May not be confined
To humans
In dogs as well
A low number
Of CAG repeats
Has been associated
With higher aggressiveness
For me
The take-home message
Of all this research
On the impact
Of the number
Of CAG repeats
On behavioral traits
Associated with masculinity
Is simple
The tendency
For a boy
To be a rough
And tumble boy
Is hardwired
To a significant extent
That also means
That the tendency
For another boy
Not to be a rough
And tumble boy
Is also hardwired
Trying to get
A timid boy
Who doesn't like
To hit
Or be hit
To sign up
To play defensive
Tackle in football
Is not likely
To be a productive effort
How can I reconcile
That statement
With my earlier citation
Of Jerome Kagan's work
In which Kagan
Commended parents
Who intervened
To push their timid son
To be bolder
The age of the boy
Makes a big difference
Kagan was looking
At parents of young children
Some of whom
Were just toddlers
I have found
That parents
Who push
Their two-year-old son
To come out
Of the corner
And play
With the big doggy
Are often successful
In their efforts
Especially if the dog
Isn't too rough
But parents
Who try to get
Their bookish
Fourteen-year-old
To sign up
For football
Are less likely
To be successful
There are exceptions
I did know
One family
Where the parents
Were able to get
Their fourteen-year-old son
To try out
For football
By contacting the coach
And asking
Whether he could
Just try out
For the place-kicker
Position
The coach agreed
He didn't have
A place-kicker
The son made the team
Nobody would ever
Mistake him
For a jock
But he did make
Two or three friends
On the team
And his social standing
Rose
Because he was now
A football player
And he told me
That he became
More comfortable
Around guys
I used to get nervous
Going past a bunch
Of jocks
Because of the way
They treated me
Back in seventh grade
He said
But then after
I started being
The place-kicker
And I was pretty
Good at it
Everything changed
The same guys
Who used to pick
On me
Were now clapping
Me on the back
After I kicked
The extra point
He seemed to grow
In self-confidence
As well
If your son
Is a gender
Atypical boy
Who draws people
Pets and trees
Who doesn't like
To play rough
And tumble sports
Who has mostly girls
And few boys
For friends
Then maybe
A gentle push
Is in order
Maybe not football
But help him
To be comfortable
With all male
Or mostly male
Activities
The vacation activity
Proposed by Martin's father
An overnight fishing trip
Is a great idea
Camping or skiing
In a mostly male group
Ideally with a grown man
Whom you trust
To look after your son
Also works
After I wrote
The first edition
Of this book
I received some
Critical emails
From readers
Who challenged me
On this point
They took me to task
Because I encouraged
Parents to nudge
Their gender
Atypical son
To engage in
Gender-typical
Mostly male
Activities
But I didn't advise
Parents to push
Their tomboy daughter
To engage in
Gender-typical
Mostly girl
Activities
It doesn't seem fair
I agree
It doesn't seem fair
But it does make sense
As I have explained
Boys who are
Gender anomalous
And who remain
Gender anomalous
Are at significantly
Higher risk
Of loneliness
Anxiety
And depression
As they move
Through adolescence
But girls
Who are gender anomalous
Are not at higher risk
For any bad outcomes
Furthermore
Girls don't seem
To need much help
Becoming more girly
If they want to
I've seen tomboys
Who adopt
Girly girl personas
In a matter of days
Or even a matter of hours
For example
During prom season
And then they take off
The prom dress
And easily slip back
Into the tomboy role
Wearing jeans
And t-shirts
And beating the boys
At the boys' own game
I've already shared
How the mean boys
In middle school
Called me
Len the femme
And fag
Martin's mother
Told me
That the boys
Teased her son
Relentlessly
Claiming that he was gay
Likewise
Gender anomalous
Girls and women
Have told me
That some people
Believe
Or hint
That they are lesbian
Especially if they
Don't care to participate
In gender typical activities
Don't use makeup
And don't like to
Gossip with the girls
What's the reality
Are gender anomalous
Boys and girls
More likely than
Gender typical boys and girls
To be gay or lesbian
How about bisexual
Those are some of the topics
We turn to next
Chapter 10
Lesbian
Gay
Bisexual
Daniel
You know how TV
Reporters
Interview
The neighbors
After some guy
Does something terrible
We never would have
Expected this from him
The neighbors say
He always seemed
Like such a normal guy
I felt as though
I were trapped
In one of those interviews
Listening to
Wendy and Paul
Describing their son
Daniel
Who had just started
11th grade
Daniel was a
Perfectly normal
Little boy
Wendy was telling me
I mean
He was all boy
He loved his trucks
And his trains
He played football
T-ball
Soccer
Everything little boys love
You know
There wasn't anything
Sissy about him
Right now
He's playing on the
Varsity football team
He plays linebacker
On defense
Tight end
On offense
Paul added
Coach told me
Last week
He's got a shot
At playing college
Ball
If he kicks
His game
Up a notch
And then
We found this
Wendy said
Handing me
A sheaf of pages
Daniel's parents
Had printed out
About a dozen pages
Of Daniel's emails
I read them
Carefully
If you jerk off
Over a picture
Of a guy
Does that mean
You're gay
I try jerking off
Over pictures of chicks
But I keep imagining
It's a guy
I look at the girl's neck
And I pretend
It's a guy's neck
I keep wishing
It were a guy
In the picture
Instead of a chick
I can't help it
I flipped to the next page
If I really am gay
I'll kill myself
I'll drive my car
Off the bay bridge
I think it could be
Really cool actually
I could rent a convertible
And just soar
Through the air
Right off the bridge
And into the sky
I'll get high
Right before I do it
One super rush
And then you die
I'm just worried
I won't die
I might just get
Brain damaged
Or paralyzed
Or something
I'll end up
Just hooked up
To tubes and things
If I'm gonna kill myself
I have to make sure
I do it right
The first time
Cause I might not
Get a second chance
You got any ideas?
Daniel's correspondent
Had typed back
Shoot yourself in the head
While the car is in the air
Just to make sure you die
That's helpful
I thought
Who is Daniel
Sending these messages to?
I asked
We don't know
Skibum678 at hotmail.com
We don't know
Who Skibum678 is
Paul said
Does Daniel know
That you're reading his email?
That you've seen these messages?
Wendy and Paul
Both shook their heads
What led you to search
His email messages
In the first place?
I asked
I was looking through
The photo galleries
On his phone
While he was at school
And I found porn
Wendy said
Porn for gay men
I showed it to Paul
And
Wendy asked me
Whether boys normally
Go through a phase
Where they look at gay porn
I said
Hell no
I've never seen
Anything like this stuff
I didn't even know
This kind of stuff existed
Paul said
We have some questions
For you
Wendy said
Glancing at the list
She had prepared
She had prepared
A lot of things
I don't know
As were
As if people
And when they're
As if people
They all saw
¿Cause people
They lived their
And somebody
Do
Which people
And you
Are
We
Who
Here
And you
And
You
increíble
Can
Are
