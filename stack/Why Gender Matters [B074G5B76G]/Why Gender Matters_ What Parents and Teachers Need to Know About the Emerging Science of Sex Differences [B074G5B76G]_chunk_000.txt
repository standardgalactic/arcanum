Why Gender Matters
What Parents and Teachers Need to Know
About the Emerging Science of Sex Differences
by Leonard Sachs, M.D., Ph.D.
This book is read by Keith Sellin-Wright,
a member of SAG-AFTRA.
For my wife, Katie, and our daughter, Sarah.
Chapter 1. Differences
Jason is 16.
His sister Sonia is 14.
They come from a stable home with two loving parents.
Mom and Dad are concerned about Jason, their son.
He's not working hard at school and his grades are sliding.
He spends most of his free time playing video games
like Grand Theft Auto or Call of Duty
or surfing the web for pictures of girls.
Both parents are actually quite proud of Sonia.
She is a straight-A student and an athlete,
and she has many friends.
But when I meet with Sonia,
she tells me that she isn't sleeping well.
She wakes up in the middle of the night
feeling guilty about having eaten
one whole slice of pizza at supper.
She often has palpitations and shortness of breath.
And she has just started to cut herself
with a razor blade secretly on her upper inner thigh
so her parents won't see.
She hasn't told her parents any of this.
On the surface, she is the golden girl.
Inside, she feels that she is falling apart.
Her brother, Jason, on the other hand,
is happy as a clam.
He can eat a whole pizza without the slightest remorse.
He has no difficulty sleeping.
In fact, his parents had to kick him out of bed
at noon on a Saturday.
He likes to spend his free time
hanging with his buddies who are just like him,
playing video games
and looking at pictures of girls online.
Matthew turned five years old in August,
just before kindergarten started.
He was looking forward to it.
From what he had heard,
kindergarten sounded like one long playdate with friends.
He could hardly wait.
So, his mother, Cindy, was surprised
when, in October,
Matthew started refusing to go to school,
refusing even to get dressed in the morning.
More than once, Cindy had to dress him,
then drag him, writhing and thrashing,
into the car,
force him into the car seat,
and then pull him out of the car
and into the school.
Cindy decided to investigate.
She sat in on his kindergarten class.
She spoke with the teacher.
Everything seemed fine.
The teacher, gentle, soft-spoken,
and well-educated,
reassured Mom that there was no cause for alarm.
But Cindy remained concerned,
and rightly so,
because major problems were just around the corner.
Caitlin was a shy child
and just the slightest bit overweight
all through elementary school.
In middle school,
she underwent a metamorphosis
from chubby wallflower
to outgoing socialite.
She lost weight so quickly
that her mother, Jill,
worried she might be anorexic.
For the next four years, though,
everything seemed great,
in a frantic and crazy sort of way.
Caitlin was juggling a heavy academic load,
had lots of friends,
and maintained a full schedule
of after-school activities,
staying up until midnight or later
doing homework.
But she seemed happy enough,
often frenzied and frazzled,
sure, but still happy.
Or at least that's what everybody thought
until the phone rang at 3 a.m.
that awful, unforgettable November night.
A nurse told Jill that Caitlin
was in the emergency room,
unconscious,
having tried to commit suicide
with an overdose of Vicodin and Xanax.
These stories share a common element.
In each case,
problems arose because the parents
did not understand some differences
between girls and boys.
In each case,
trouble might have been averted
if the parents had known enough
about boy-girl differences
to recognize what was really happening
in their child's life.
In each case,
the parents could have taken specific action
that might have prevented
or solved the problem.
We will come back to each of these kids
later in this book.
Right now,
it may not be obvious to you
how each of these stories
illustrates a failure
to understand sex differences.
That's okay.
Later on,
we'll hear more about Justin and Sonia,
Matthew, and Caitlin.
Armed with some knowledge
about boy-girl differences,
you will be able to recognize
where the parents made the wrong decision
or failed to act,
and you will see how the stories
might have ended differently.
The Dubious Virtue of Gender-Neutral Child-Rearing
I enrolled in the Ph.D. program in psychology
at the University of Pennsylvania
way back in September 1980.
Governor Ronald Reagan
was challenging President Jimmy Carter
for the presidency.
The original Apple computer
had recently come on the market.
My typewriter is working fine
was the answer the department secretary
gave me when I asked her
whether she would be getting a computer
any time soon.
Nobody I knew
had ever heard of email
or the Internet.
The invention of the World Wide Web
still lay ten years in the future.
Among the courses I took that fall
was a graduate seminar
in developmental psychology.
Why do girls and boys
behave differently?
My professor,
Justin Ehrenfried,
asked rhetorically.
Because we expect them to.
We teach them to.
Imagine a world
in which we raised girls
to play with tanks and trucks
in which we encouraged boys
to play with dolls.
Imagine a world
in which we played
rough-and-tumble games
with girls
while we cuddled
and hugged the boys.
In such a world,
many of the differences
we see in how girls
and boys behave,
maybe even all the differences,
would vanish.
In another seminar,
my fellow graduate students
and I learned about
the extraordinary work
of Professor John Money
at Johns Hopkins.
Professor Money
had been consulted
by the parents
of an unfortunate little boy
whose penis
had literally been sizzled off
during a botched circumcision.
At Dr. Money's recommendation,
the boy had been raised
as a girl
with excellent results,
according to Dr. Money.
The child loved
to play dress-up,
enjoyed helping mom
in the kitchen,
and disdained boy toys
such as guns or trucks.
Dr. Money's work
provides further evidence
that most of the differences
we observe
between girls and boys
are socially constructed,
Professor Henry Gleitman
told us.
We reward children
who follow the sex roles
we create for them
while we penalize
or at least fail
to reward children
who don't conform.
Parents create
and reinforce differences
between girls and boys.
We nodded sagely.
In clinical rotations,
we often encountered parents
who still clung
to the quaint notion
that girls and boys
were different from birth.
But we knew better.
Or so we thought.
I graduated
with my Ph.D.
in psychology
as well as my M.D.
in 1986.
When I left Philadelphia
to begin my residency
and family practice,
I got rid of most
of the papers
I had accumulated
during my six years
at the University of Pennsylvania.
But there was one folder
I didn't throw out.
A folder of papers
about sex differences
in hearing,
showing that girls
and boys hear differently.
Four years later,
after I finished
my residency
in family medicine,
my wife and I
established a family practice
in Montgomery County, Maryland,
just outside
of Washington, D.C.
Several years passed.
I wasn't thinking much
about gender differences.
Then, in the mid-1990s,
I began to notice
a parade of second
and third grade boys
marching into my office,
their parents
clutching a note
from the school.
The notes read,
We're concerned
that Justin
or Carlos
or Tyrone
may have
attention deficit disorder.
Please evaluate.
In some of these cases,
I found that
what these boys needed
wasn't drugs for ADHD,
attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder,
but rather,
a teacher
who understood
the differences
in how girls
and boys learn.
Upon further inquiry,
I found that
nobody at the school
was aware of
girl-boy differences
in the ability to hear.
I re-read the papers
in that manila folder,
documenting
hard-wired differences
in the ability to hear,
showing that
the average boy
has hearing
that is less sensitive
than the average girl.
In the next chapter,
we will look more closely
at evidence
for sex differences
in hearing.
Think about the typical
second-grade classroom.
Imagine Justin,
six years old,
sitting at the back
of the class.
The teacher,
a woman,
is speaking in a tone
of voice that seems
about right to her.
Justin barely hears her.
Instead,
he's staring out the window
or watching a fly
crawl across the ceiling.
The teacher notices
that Justin
isn't paying attention.
Justin is demonstrating
a deficit of attention.
The teacher may reasonably wonder
whether Justin perhaps
has attention deficit disorder.
The teacher is absolutely right
about Justin
showing a deficit of attention.
But his attention deficit
isn't due to
attention deficit disorder.
It's due to the fact
that Justin
isn't hearing
the soft-spoken teacher
very well.
And very few
six-year-old boys
will raise their hands
and say,
Excuse me,
Ms. Gentle Voice,
I do hear you,
but not very well.
Could you please
speak more loudly?
The teacher is talking
in a tone of voice
that seems comfortable
to her,
but some of the boys
are zoning out.
In some cases,
we might be able
to fix the problem
simply by putting
the boy
in the front row.
You should write a book,
Dr. Sachs,
one parent told me.
Write a book
so that more teachers
know about the differences
in how girls
and boys hear.
I allowed myself
a patronizing smile.
I'm sure that there
must already be
such books for teachers
and for parents,
I said.
There aren't,
she said.
I'll find some for you,
I said.
That conversation
took place
nearly twenty years ago.
Since then,
I've read lots
of popular books
about differences
between girls
and boys.
And guess what?
That mom was right.
Not only do most
of the books
currently in print
about girls and boys
fail to state
the basic facts
about innate differences
between the sexes,
but many of them
promote a bizarre form
of political correctness,
suggesting that it is
somehow chauvinistic
even to hint
that any innate differences
exist between
female and male.
A tenured professor
at Brown University
published a book
in which she claims
that the division
of the human race
into two sexes,
female and male,
is an artificial invention
of our culture.
Nature really offers us
more than two sexes,
she claims,
adding,
our current notions
of masculinity
and femininity
are cultural conceits.
The decision
to label a child
as a girl
or a boy
is a social decision,
according to this expert.
We should not label
any child
as being either
a girl or a boy,
this professor proclaims.
There is no either or.
Rather,
there are shades
of difference.
This book received
courteous mention
in the New York Times
and the Washington Post.
America's most
prestigious medical journal,
the New England
Journal of Medicine,
praised the author
for her
careful and insightful
approach to gender.
I soon assembled
a small library
of books
that counsel parents
that the best
child-rearing
is gender-neutral
child-rearing.
These books
tell parents
that true virtue
is to be found
in training your child
to play with toys
traditionally associated
with the opposite sex.
You should buy dolls
for your son
to teach him
how to nurture.
You should buy
an erector set
for your daughter.
The underlying assumptions
that giving dolls
to boys
will cause boys
to become more nurturing
or that giving girls
erector sets
will improve
girls' spatial relations
skills
are seldom questioned.
On the same bookshelf,
you can find books
that do affirm
the existence
of innate differences
in how girls
and boys learn,
but these books
often promote
antiquated and inaccurate
gender stereotypes.
Girls are more emotional
than boys.
Boys have a brain-based
advantage
when it comes
to learning math.
Those notions
turn out to be false.
On one hand,
you have books
claiming that
there are no
innate differences
between girls
and boys
and that anybody
who thinks otherwise
is a reactionary
stuck in the 1950s.
On the other,
you have books
affirming innate differences
between girls
and boys,
but these authors
interpret these differences
in a manner
that reinforces
gender stereotypes.
These books
have only one thing
in common.
They are based
less on fact
and more on
their authors'
personal beliefs
or political agendas,
either to deny
innate sex differences
or to use
sex differences
in child development
as a justification
for maintaining
traditional sex roles.
After waiting
for somebody else
to write a book
about girls and boys
based on actual
scientific research
and clinical experience,
I finally decided
to write one myself.
Every child is unique.
I will not suggest
that all boys
are the same
or that all girls
are the same.
I know that they are not.
I have been a medical doctor
for more than 30 years.
I am the veteran
of thousands
of office visits
with girls and boys.
But the fact
that each child
is unique
and complex
should not blind us
to the fact
that gender
is one of the two
great organizing principles
in child development,
the other principle
being age.
Trying to understand
a child
without understanding
the role of gender
in child development
is like trying
to understand
a child's behavior
without knowing
the child's age.
Pick up a book
with a title like
What to Expect
from Your Two-Year-Old.
That book is very different
from What to Expect
from Your Eight-Year-Old.
Of course,
nobody is saying
that all two-year-olds
are alike
or that all eight-year-olds
are alike.
While recognizing diversity
among two-year-olds,
we can still have
a meaningful discussion
of the ways
in which two-year-olds
and eight-year-olds
differ,
categorically,
in terms of
what they can do,
what they're interested in,
how they relate
to their parents,
and so on.
At least with regard
to how children
hear and speak,
gender may be
even more fundamental
to learning
than age is.
When the noted linguist
and Georgetown University
professor Deborah Tannen
compared how girls
and boys
of different ages
use language,
she was overwhelmed
by the differences
that separated
the females and males
at each age
and the striking similarities
that linked
the females on one hand
and the males
on the other
across the vast
expanse of age.
In many ways,
the second-grade girls
were more like
the 25-year-old women
than like
the second-grade boys.
The analogy
to age differences
provides a good way
to think about
sex differences.
No two girls
are alike
just as no two boys
are alike.
Seven-year-old Stephanie,
who likes to roll
in the mud
and play soccer,
is very different
from seven-year-old Zoe.
Zoe's favorite hobby
is playing
with her Barbies.
Zoe also insisted
on joining
the Junior Palms,
a sort of
cheerleading group.
Zoe was asking
for lipstick
at age five.
Her mother Barbara,
a sincere
old-school feminist,
was horrified.
Where is this
coming from?
She asked me,
bewildered.
I only own
one lipstick
and I haven't
used it in six months.
And I loathe
and despise Barbies.
I've never even
bought one for Zoe.
She gets all that
trash as gifts
from her aunts
and uncles.
Despite their
differences,
Stephanie may share
more with Zoe
than you might imagine.
In their ability
to listen,
in their visual system,
and in their
willingness to
affiliate with adults,
as we will see,
Stephanie may have
more in common
with Zoe
than she has
in common
with her brother
or with most boys.
The first edition
of this book
was published
in 2005.
In the years since,
much new research
has been published
demonstrating
important,
hardwired differences
between girls
and boys.
But few parents
and teachers
are aware
of this research
because very little
of it has been
reported in the
news media.
In this updated edition,
I will share
some of that research.
We will start
with some astonishing
new research
showing big sex
differences
in the ability
to smell,
as well as new
research on girl-boy
differences in hearing
and in vision.
Next,
we will look at
research on girl-boy
differences in risk-taking
and in aggression.
In Chapter 5,
I will share
some of what I have
learned from my visits
to more than 400 schools
over the past 16 years
about girl-boy differences
in the classroom.
When teachers
understand those differences,
the result is
more boys who love
Emily Dickinson
and Jane Eyre
and more girls
who want to do
computer coding.
In Chapter 6,
we will consider
some recent research
on girl-boy differences
in sex itself,
how girls and boys
experience sexual
motivation differently
and often have
different sexual agendas.
The link between
romance and sex
appears to be
constructed differently
in most girls
compared with most boys,
as we will see.
In Chapter 7,
we turn our attention
to drugs and alcohol.
Girls and boys
both get addicted,
but they get addicted
in different ways
and often via
different pathways.
The more you know
about those differences,
the better equipped
you will be
to safeguard
your daughter
or your son.
Chapter 8
is completely new
for this edition.
It's all about
social media
and video games.
Snapchat and Instagram
didn't exist
when the first edition
of this book
was published in 2005,
and in that bygone era,
playing a video game
meant playing
on a console
against another gamer
using the same console
or against
the computer itself.
Online gaming
as we know it today
did not exist.
Over the past decade,
a great deal
of research
has been published
on the effects
of video games
and social media.
The more time
girls spend
on social media
such as Snapchat
and Instagram,
the more likely
they are to become
anxious or depressed.
But that's much
less true of boys.
Boys, on the other hand,
are more likely
to be spending
many hours a week
playing video games,
which can undermine
their social skills.
Chapters 9,
10 and 11
are devoted
to girls and boys
who don't fit
gender-typical patterns.
In Chapter 9,
we look at the latest
research on gender-atypical
girls and boys,
the kinds of kids
who used to be called
tomboys and sissies.
Girls differ
from one another.
Boys differ
from one another.
Differences among girls
and differences among boys
are not just noise
in the data.
The differences
are meaningful
and consequential.
Gender is complicated.
In Chapter 10,
our focus is on
lesbian, gay,
and bisexual kids.
And in Chapter 11,
I will share with you
my understanding
of the research
on intersex
and transgender individuals.
These three chapters,
9, 10, and 11,
form a unit.
In order to understand
some of the research
that I present
in Chapter 11
on transgender individuals,
it's helpful to know
about the research
in Chapter 9
on the androgen receptor.
So, if you are going
to read these three chapters,
I hope you will read
them in order.
In the final chapter,
Chapter 12,
I try to make sense
of how we as parents
can use all this information
to help our children
grow up to be
all that they were
meant to be.
There's no going back
to the bad old days
of the 1950s
when girls and boys
were pigeonholed
into pink and blue cubbies.
But what does it mean
to affirm and cherish
gender differences
in the modern era
when girls and boys
can be anything
they want to be?
That's one of the questions
we will consider
in the closing chapter
and throughout the book.
In the 12 years
since the publication
of the first edition,
a world of new research
on gender differences
has been published.
Much of this research
is not well known
outside of scholarly circles.
You will discover
that new research here.
Gender is complicated,
as I said.
But gender matters.
There is more at stake here
than the old question
of nature versus nurture.
The failure to recognize
and respect sex differences
in child development
has done substantial harm.
Such will be my claim
throughout this book.
I will try to convince you
that the lack of awareness
of gender differences
has had the unintended result
of reinforcing gender stereotypes.
The result
is more girls
uploading sexualized
and provocative photos
to their Instagram
and Snapchat
and more boys
spending hours
playing violent video games
in which they pretend
to be macho warriors
or villains.
You may not yet see
the connection
between gender-blind upbringing
and gender-stereotyped outcomes.
In this book,
I will show you
that connection.
Just as important,
the growing confusion
about gender
is contributing
to a rise in anxiety
and depression
among girls
and disengagement
among boys.
I have been encouraged
by all the readers
who have contacted me
over the past 12 years
to tell me
how valuable
the first edition
of Why Gender Matters
has been to them
in parenting,
in working with troubled youth,
in teaching,
in pastoral work,
in juvenile justice.
I have written
this new edition
with you in mind,
the mother,
the father,
the social worker,
the teacher,
the school administrator,
the pastor,
the rabbi,
the imam,
the probation officer.
I hope you find it useful.
Chapter 2
Smelling,
Seeing,
and Hearing
A marriage is risky business
these days.
History and experience
both make clear
that men and women
do not hear
the music of the world
in the same key.
So what is left
to justify a marriage?
Maybe only the hunch
that half the world
will ever be present
in any room
with just a single pair
of eyes to see it.
Whatever is invisible
to one
is to the other
an enormous golden lion.
Bill Holm,
Wedding Poem
for Shayla and Phil
Smelling
For eighteen years
I practiced
in a suburb
of Washington, D.C.
in Montgomery County, Maryland.
A husband and wife
I knew,
let's call them
Jennifer and Tom,
went away
for a one-week vacation
in August.
Shortly after
they returned home,
Jennifer came to see me.
When we got home
from vacation,
I stepped into my kitchen
and I thought
I would die
from the smell,
Jennifer said.
It reeked.
It's hard
to describe the stench.
Imagine a rotting carcass
on a pile of chicken poop.
Actually,
Jennifer didn't say poop.
She used a different word.
And it was hot.
We had left
the air conditioning off
while we were away.
But when we turned
the air conditioning back on,
that just seemed
to make it worse.
It blew the smell
all through the house.
And I'm pretty sure
whatever died,
something must have died,
was in the ductwork somewhere.
I think I smelled
that smell
or just a trace of it
before we left.
But whatever it was,
it was a million times
more powerful
when we got back home.
So I told my husband,
we need to hire somebody,
a contractor
or a ductwork person
to come out
and find out
what died
and clean it out.
And do you know
what my husband said?
No, I said.
He said,
I don't smell anything.
Can you believe it?
I think he must
just be trying
to annoy me.
Either that
or he truly is
a pig
raised in a barn.
Two days later,
Tom came to see me.
He said,
My wife is being a witch.
Actually,
he didn't say witch.
He used a different word.
She keeps going on
and on
about how we have
to hire somebody
to clean out
our ductwork
or rip open
the wall or something
to figure out
where some god-awful smell
is coming from.
But I do not smell anything.
And I'll be darned
if I'm going to spend
a pile of money
trying to get rid
of a smell
I can't even smell.
Actually,
he didn't say darned.
I told Tom
the same thing
I told Jennifer.
The sense of smell
is different
between women and men.
It's entirely plausible
that a woman
could perceive
an odor that is,
for the woman,
overpoweringly awful
while the man
doesn't smell anything.
The best approach
is for each partner
to respect
and trust
the other's report.
If you're a woman
and your husband
says he doesn't smell anything,
don't call him a pig.
Explain to him
that even though
he doesn't smell
the horrible stench,
you do smell it.
If you're a man
and your wife says
that there is
an overpowering odor
that is giving her
a headache,
don't call her a witch.
Respect the fact
that under certain circumstances,
women may perceive
odors that men
can't detect.
What's the evidence?
In the laboratory,
Dr. Pamela Dalton
and her colleagues
exposed men and women
to several smells.
Not just once,
but over and over again.
Dr. Dalton
and her co-workers
found that
with repeated exposure,
the women's ability
to detect the odor
improved.
How much did it improve?
By a factor of 50%?
Or maybe by 500%?
A five-fold improvement?
No.
The average improvement
for women
was an improvement
of 100,000-fold.
The women were able
to detect the odor
at a concentration
one one-hundred-thousandth
of the concentration
they had needed
at the beginning
of the study.
What about the men?
Did they show
a similar improvement?
A 100,000-fold
increase in sensitivity?
No, they did not.
Okay, how about
a thousand-fold improvement?
Nope.
How about just
a hundred-fold improvement?
Sorry.
The men, on average,
showed no improvement
at all
in their ability
to detect the odor.
Jennifer hired a service
to clean out the ductwork.
The men did indeed
find two dead rats,
which were the source
of the pungent odor.
The rats had died
in a small puddle
of trapped water,
which seemed to have
made the smell worse.
Here's what I think happened.
The rats must have died
at least a few days
before the family
left on vacation.
Jennifer said
there was a trace
of the odor
before she left.
Each time Jennifer
came into the house
before she left
on vacation,
she was being exposed
to the odor,
something like the subjects
in Dr. Dalton's study.
With each successive exposure,
she was becoming
more sensitive
to the odor.
Then she and Tom
and their kids
went away on vacation.
When she came back,
the odor was much stronger
because the rats
had been rotting
in the warm ductwork.
But Tom didn't smell
anything at all.
How is that possible?
What's going on
in the anatomy
of the olfactory system,
the system we use to smell,
that can account
for such huge differences
between female and male?
Quick anatomy lesson.
Smell receptors
in the nose
send their signals
via the olfactory nerve
to the olfactory bulb.
The olfactory bulb
is located
on the bottom side
of the brain.
The olfactory bulb
is the first stop
for information
about smell.
There are two kinds
of cells in the brain.
Neurons are considered
the most important
because they seem
to play the most important
role in sending information
via electrical signals.
But glial cells
are essential too
because they provide
structure
and may also
modulate information
processing in the brain.
On all counts,
women beat men.
Women have more cells
in the olfactory bulb,
16.2 million
in the average woman
compared with
9.2 million
in men.
When you look
just at the neurons
in the olfactory bulb,
the average woman
has 6.9 million
compared with
just 3.5 million
in males.
When you look
at the glial cells,
women again
have more,
9.3 million
in the average woman
compared with
5.7 million
in the average man.
All these differences
are highly
statistically significant.
When I read
this report
about sex differences
in the olfactory bulb,
I thought of my visit
to girls' schools
and boys' schools
near Hastings, New Zealand.
Single-sex schools
are very popular
in New Zealand.
I met with girls
at Natawa,
a girls' school.
The school leaders
had arranged
an optional
co-curricular activity
with a nearby
boys' school,
a ballroom dancing club,
which met in the evening.
But administrators
at both schools
were discouraged
because the club
was not popular
with the girls.
There were many more boys
than girls in attendance.
The boys refused
to dance with other boys,
so half the boys
were sitting
and watching other boys
dancing with the girls.
Each week,
there were fewer girls
in attendance.
I asked the girls,
Why don't you want
to go to the
ballroom dancing club?
One of the girls
answered,
I can't stand
those smelly boys
putting their hands
on me.
Then I met
with the boys.
I asked them,
Do you take a shower
before you go
to the ballroom
dancing club?
All the boys
shook their heads no.
I asked,
Why not?
One of the boys
answered,
No need.
I don't smell bad.
I told that boy
and the other boys,
You have no idea
how you smell
to a girl.
You're not a girl.
You can't smell odors
the way a girl
can smell odors.
You need to go home
and shower
with soap
before you go
to the ballroom
dancing club.
If you're a mother
and you have a son
and his room stinks,
don't say,
What's wrong with you?
How can you
stand the stench?
If your son's room
doesn't smell good,
begin by asking
your son
whether he thinks
his room smells bad.
If he says no,
explain to him
that his room
does smell
but he can't smell it.
Explain that
good hygiene
means keeping
the room clean
even if he doesn't
think it smells bad.
And clean
may mean
something different
to you,
his mother,
than it does
to your son.
Explain that
your definition,
not his,
is the standard
that will be enforced.
Explain that
learning to conform
to a woman's
standard of cleanliness
is a useful life skill
for any man
if he hopes
someday to live
with a female partner.
As I said,
I have been a medical doctor
for more than 30 years.
I have seen
many marriages end.
On television,
when marriages end,
there's often
a romantic affair
going on.
One of the partners
is cheating on the other.
In the real world,
in my observation,
romantic affairs
are less often
the cause of divorce.
Many busy parents
just don't have time
for that sort of thing.
The disintegration
of a marriage
often begins
with miscommunication
of just the sort
that I described
between Jennifer and Tom.
Before they met with me,
they were angry
with each other.
Jennifer thought
Tom was belittling
her concern
about the bad smell.
Tom thought
Jennifer was being
unnecessarily fussy,
complaining about
an odor
that he couldn't smell.
That sort of problem,
repeated over and over,
can lead to a loss
of affection.
But once Tom and Jennifer
understood what was going on,
they could understand
each other better
with good humor
and with an understanding
of their differences.
Hearing
Remember that story
I shared in Chapter 1
about the second grade boy
in Ms. Gentle Voice's classroom
who wasn't paying attention?
I have been involved
in many cases like that
over the years.
Some of those boys
did better,
as I mentioned,
when you moved them
to the front row
or when you moved them
to a classroom
with a teacher
who spoke more loudly.
Simply asking
Ms. Gentle Voice
to speak more loudly
seldom works,
I discovered.
Ms. Gentle Voice
may make an effort
for a day or two
or even a week or two,
but eventually
she is likely
to revert
to her usual style.
In the first edition
of Why Gender Matters,
I tried to understand
why some boys
do better
with a teacher
who speaks more loudly.
I didn't do
a very good job.
I cited research
on hearing thresholds,
the softest tone
that can be heard.
The threshold
for the average girl
or woman
is quieter
than for the average boy
or man,
but the girl-boy difference
is not huge
and there is lots of overlap
between the sexes.
And it turns out,
sex differences
in hearing thresholds
aren't really relevant
to differences
in how girls and boys
experience mid-range sounds
well above the threshold.
In my defense,
the first study
to adequately explain
this phenomenon
of boys not hearing
the quiet-voiced teacher
was not published
until 2007,
two years after
the publication
of Why Gender Matters.
The research
is a bit technical,
so I have put
my discussion
of the research
into the extra-stuff
sex differences
in hearing
at the end of this book.
Here's the bottom line.
For the average boy
to hear you
as well as the average girl,
you have to speak
about eight decibels
more loudly.
A difference of eight decibels
is about three clicks
on the volume dial
of a typical car radio.
It doesn't mean shouting.
It does mean
speaking more loudly.
If you're a mother
and you feel
that your son
is ignoring you,
try speaking
just a bit more loudly.
This works
the other way as well.
A girl in my practice
complained that her father
was always shouting at her.
It wasn't what he said
that bothered her,
but the way that he spoke.
He was too loud.
Annoying,
she said.
She told me
that she just slips
into her bedroom
and closes the door.
She was avoiding contact
with her own father
because she didn't like
to be shouted at.
A few days later,
I spoke with Dad.
I mentioned
that his daughter
indicated that he
sometimes raised
his voice with her.
I have never once
raised my voice
to that child.
You hear what
I'm saying to you?
Dad said to me
very loudly,
almost shouting.
I explained
that sensitivity
to loudness
varies as a function
of age
and also
of biological sex.
Girls and women
are, on average,
more sensitive
to sounds
than boys or men
of the same age.
Again,
listen to the extra stuff
at the end of the book
for more data
on this point.
Also,
children and teenagers
are more sensitive
to sounds
than middle-aged people are.
I explained
that as a middle-aged man
speaking to a teenage daughter,
he was much less sensitive
to sound
than she was.
He didn't think
he was shouting,
but his daughter
was experiencing
something close
to shouting.
I suggested
that the next time
he spoke to his daughter,
he should make an effort
to speak
much more quietly.
A few weeks later,
I saw his daughter again.
Totally amazing,
she said.
My dad can actually
talk like a normal person.
She wasn't avoiding
him anymore.
Seeing
Twenty years ago,
a little boy
named Andrew Phillips,
his true name,
came home from school
on the brink of tears.
The teacher
had given
each of the children
in the class
a small box of crayons
and a blank sheet
of white paper.
Let's have a little
creative time.
Draw whatever you want,
the teacher had said.
Andrew had used
his black crayon
to draw two stick figures
stabbing each other
with knives.
Other kids in the class,
who happened
to be mostly girls,
had drawn
colorful pictures
of people
and pets
and flowers
and trees.
The people
in the girls'
pictures
had hair
on their heads.
They had clothes
on their bodies.
Andrew's stick figures
had none
of these adornments.
The teacher
praised the girls'
drawings,
but not Andrew's.
Andrew came home
upset.
His mother,
Janet,
arranged to speak
to the teacher,
who was unapologetic.
Actually,
I considered
making a referral,
the teacher said.
A referral?
What do you mean?
Janet asked.
A referral
to mental health.
After all,
he did draw
two people
attacking each other
with knives.
But he's a six-year-old boy,
Janet said.
Of course he is,
and that's why
I decided
against initiating
the referral.
A child's choice
of what he wants
to draw
says something
important about him.
A boy who wants
to draw pictures
of warriors fighting
is a different
sort of child
from the girl
or boy
who wants to draw
friends or pets
or flowers.
Here's an old fable.
Nazradin was
the chief keeper
of ornamental birds
for the king.
One day,
walking about
the royal grounds,
he saw a falcon
that had alighted
on a tree.
He took out
his scissors
and trimmed
the claws,
the wings,
and the beak
of the falcon.
That is at least
some improvement,
he said.
Your keeper
had evidently
been neglecting you.
Moral?
You cannot turn
a falcon
into a robin
or a dove.
You will merely
succeed in ruining
the falcon.
The teacher
had said,
Why can't you
draw something
less violent,
something more
like what Melissa
drew or Emily?
But what Andrew
heard was,
Why do you have
to be who you are?
Why can't you
be someone else?
Why do you
have to be a falcon?
Why can't you
be a robin
or a dove?
Andrew's mom
pulled him out
of the well-regarded
private co-ed school
he was attending
and transferred him
to Mater Dei,
an all-boys school
in Bethesda, Maryland.
Before long,
he was drawing again.
The teachers
at the boys' schools
weren't so insistent
on the boys
using lots of
different colors
or drawing faces
with eyes and mouths
and hair.
Instead,
the teachers
helped the boys
to make their
action pictures
more exciting,
more vivid.
And they asked
the boys
to tell the stories
behind the pictures.
Andrew loved
telling stories
about heroes
and dragons
and battles.
Andrew blossomed
at the boys' school.
He became
not only an artist
but also a writer
and actor
and an athlete.
And what an athlete!
Andrew grew
into the most talented
athlete I have seen
in my three decades
as a physician.
By the time
he graduated
from high school,
he was six feet
four inches tall,
290 pounds
of solid muscle.
He was recruited
by many of the top
NCAA Division I
football programs.
He chose Stanford
because it had
the best academics
of any program
offering him
a scholarship.
At Stanford,
he majored
in the classics,
studying Latin
and Greek.
And he was
a starting lineman
on the astonishing
Stanford team
that rose into
the top ten
during Andrew's
years at Stanford,
helped not only
by Andrew,
but also
by Andrew's
friend,
another Andrew
named Andrew Luck.
You don't need
a boys' school
to achieve results
like Andrew's.
You do need
teachers who
understand and
respect the
differences between
girls and boys.
What happens
when you give
girls and boys
a blank piece
of paper
and a box
of crayons
and ask them
to draw
whatever they
want to draw?
Researchers
who have
conducted
such studies
consistently find
that girls
are more likely
to draw flowers
and trees
and pets
with lots
of colors.
The people
in the girls'
drawings have
eyes,
mouths,
hair,
and clothes.
A few boys
do draw pictures
just like the girls
draw.
In Chapter 9,
we will learn
that those
gender-atypical boys,
boys who draw
pictures like
those the girls
draw,
have other features
in common
with other
gender-atypical
boys.
But the great
majority of boys
draw pictures
that are quite
different from
the girls'
pictures.
Most boys
draw a scene
of action
at a moment
of dynamic
change,
like a monster
eating an alien
or a rocket
smashing into
a planet.
Human figures,
if present,
are often just
stick figures
lacking eyes,
mouth,
hair,
and clothes.
Some teachers
have figured out
these boy-girl
differences on
their own.
But many teachers
have not.
And you can't
blame the
teachers.
I have met
teachers who
have master's
degrees in
early elementary
education from
leading universities
such as the
Harvard Graduate
School of Education
or the University
of Texas at
Austin,
and yet those
teachers have
never been told
about these
boy-girl
differences.
On the contrary,
the teachers have
been taught that
when a six-year-old
draws a human
figure,
that figure
should have
eyes,
a mouth,
and hair.
And if those
features are lacking,
then the student
should be corrected.
The underlying
unspoken assumption
is that there is
just one right way
for children to
draw,
with lots of
colors and
detail.
The boys'
pictures often
don't fulfill
these criteria,
and boys who
draw pictures
with violent
themes,
such as a
knight killing
a dragon,
are often told,
subtly or not,
that they are
out of bounds.
Sometimes the
correction is
gentle.
Andrew,
why do you
have to draw
something so
violent?
Now,
look at Emily's
pretty picture
of the cute
puppy.
Why can't
you draw
something like
that?
Sometimes the
correction is
more emphatic.
I heard from
one parent
whose young
son was
disciplined
because the
boy's drawing
of a Roman
gladiator
beheading
another
gladiator
violated the
school's
zero-tolerance
policy on
violence and
depictions of
violence.
One result
is that many
boys disengage
from visual
arts.
I visited
a second-grade
classroom in
an American
elementary school.
The teacher
said,
Free time,
you can do
whatever you
want.
Some of the
girls sat in
the center of
the classroom
and began
coloring.
One boy
started running
around the
room making
buzzing noises.
After watching
him for a
minute, I got
in his way
and I stopped
him.
I pointed at
the girls and
I said,
How come
you don't
want to
sit and
draw?
The boy
responded without
hesitation or
apology.
Drawing is
for girls.
Drawing is
for girls.
Where did
he get that
idea?
I'm sure the
teacher never
said,
Drawing is
for girls.
But she
might as
well have.
By praising
and understanding
pictures of
people, pets,
flowers, and
trees with
lots of
colors, but
not really
comprehending the
point of a
picture all in
black crayon of
a knight killing
a dragon, that
teacher is
unintentionally
sending the
message that
drawing is for
girls.
The lack of
awareness of
gender differences
has the
unintended consequence
of reinforcing
gender stereotypes.
The result is a
culture in which
many boys believe
that drawing is
for girls.
Last year, fewer
than one in four
students who took
the AP exam in
studio art were
boys.
There's nothing
innate about
that.
Men are
perfectly capable
of creating
great art.
But in modern
American culture,
very few boys
want to study
art.
They have been
turned off by a
gender-blind
culture that,
because of its
gender-blindness,
inadvertently sends
the message that
drawing is for
girls.
While there may
not be any
innate difference
in the ability
to draw, I do
think the evidence
clearly demonstrates
a big difference
in what kind of
drawings girls and
boys want to
draw.
In every culture
researchers have
studied, in
Africa, Asia,
Europe, and
North America,
girls are more
likely to draw
pictures of
flowers and pets
using lots of
colors, while boys
are more likely to
draw scenes of
actions using
fewer colors.
In my visits to
more than 400
schools over the
past 16 years,
I have learned
that when teachers
understand these
differences, they
can break down
gender stereotypes
and the same boy
who loves football
and video games
will also love to
draw.
There is now
growing evidence
that these
differences in the
kind of drawings
boys and girls
like to make may
derive in some
substantial part from
hardwired differences
in the visual
system.
I present some of
this evidence in
the extra stuff sex
differences in
vision at the end
of the book.
All of us humans
have two visual
systems inside our
heads.
One system is
devoted to color,
detail, and
texture.
The other is
devoted to speed
and direction,
especially to
changes in
direction.
The evidence I
cite in the
extra stuff section
suggests that
girls and women
have more resources
in the system
that specializes
in color, detail,
and texture.
Boys and men
have more resources
in the system
that specializes
in speed and
direction.
There has been
a feminization
of American
education,
especially in the
early years.
The result is
that the female
perspective has
become normative.
That's a fancy
way of saying
that the female
way of seeing
things is now
so ingrained
that nobody's
even aware of it.
Of course a
picture of a
human figure
should have eyes,
a mouth,
hair, and
clothes.
How could
anyone suggest
otherwise?
But here's the
good news.
I have seen
firsthand how
dramatically the
classroom can
change when
teachers, both
women and men,
have one day's
training in these
differences.
Just explain to
the teacher that
most boys want to
draw action, not
color and texture.
Remind teachers
that the job of
the teacher is to
help the boy draw
the picture he
wants to draw,
more vivid, more
evocative of the
action.
Sometimes just
drawing a few
lines to signify
the wind or
the whoosh of
the car can
brighten the
boy's face.
Women teachers
can do this just
as well as men
can.
We'll talk more
about some of
these strategies
in Chapter
5.
Chapter 3
Risk
The secret to
getting the most
fun out of life
is to live
dangerously.

Tossing
the Ring
Let's suppose
you're a college
freshman taking
introductory
psychology.
One of the
course requirements
includes volunteering
as a subject
in the study.
You choose
the Ring Toss
study because
the course guide
says it will
take only 20
minutes and no
needles are
involved.
You show up
for the study.
The technician
shows you what
you're supposed
to do.
There's a one-foot
pole standing
upright on the
floor.
You are given
six rubber rings
each about the
size of a
horseshoe.
The technician
tells you to
toss the rings
at the pole
one ring at a
time.
The object of the
game is to land
the ring right on
the pole.
Where do I
stand, you ask,
noticing that the
floor is marked
off one foot from
the target, two
feet, five
feet, ten
feet, fifteen
feet, and twenty
feet.
Anywhere you like,
the assistant
says.
You mean I could
do all the tosses
from one foot away,
you ask?
The technician
nods.
Do I have to hit
the target a certain
percentage of times?
No, the technician
answers.
Just toss the six
rings and we'll move
on to the next part of
the experiment.
I'll step out of the
room to give you some
privacy.
Privacy, you ask?
But the technician is
already gone.
What do you do now?
Most young women will
stand one or two feet
away from the target,
toss the rings, and
move on.
Most young men stand
five or ten feet away
from the target, even
though doing so greatly
increases their risk of
missing the target.
You toss the rings.
Okay, now we're
now we move on to the
next part of the
experiment, the
assistant says.
A door opens and in
step two of your
classmates.
You nod and say
hello.
The sex of the two
classmates is the same
as yours.
If you're a woman,
they're female.
The two classmates are
asked to sit in chairs
along the wall facing
you.
Okay, now we do it
again, the assistant
says, handing you the
rings again.
Most young women will
toss the rings just the
same when other women
are present as they do
when they are by
themselves.
But most young men
behave differently.
When other young men
are watching, most young
men will demonstrate what
psychologists call a
risky shift.
If the man tossed the
rings from two feet when
he was alone, he'll back
up to five feet when the
other men are in the
room.
If he tossed the rings
from five feet when he
was alone, he'll back up
to ten feet when other
men are watching, even if
he's never met the men
before and never expects
to see them again.
I guess I didn't want
them to think I was a
wuss, is the way one
explained the change in
his behavior.
Living Dangerously
Many boys enjoy taking
physical risks, and the
majority of boys are
impressed by other boys
who take risks, especially
if the risk-taker succeeds.
Girls are less likely to
enjoy physical risk-taking
for its own sake and are
much less likely to be
impressed by risk-taking
behavior and others.
In another study, boys
and girls both engaged in
the same risky activity, but
girls experienced the risk
as less fun and more
stressful.
Girls may be willing to
take risks, but they are
less likely to seek out
risky situations just for
the sake of living
dangerously.
Imagine yourself back in
middle school.
Suppose you heard about a
friend who rode a bicycle
off of a 12-foot-high
boardwalk and landed on a
sandy beach, just for fun.
Boys who engage in that
kind of risk-taking behavior
will likely raise their
status in the eyes of
their peers.
Did you hear what Brett did?
Rode his bike off the top
of the boardwalk.
Awesome!
Even if they fail, those
boys are likely to earn the
respect of other boys for
trying.
If girls heard about another
girl who rode her bike on
purpose off the top of a
12-foot-high boardwalk, they
would be less likely to
ooh and ah.
They might even be
critical.
She must be totally nuts to
do something like that.
What a weirdo, another girl
might say.
Another example, this time
with high school kids.
Suppose a 12th-grade boy goes
to a party Friday night and
has unprotected sex with a
college woman he's just met,
and then on Saturday night he
goes to another party and has
unprotected sex with a
different young woman.
His buddies will be impressed,
especially if the boys
glimpsed the two women and
consider them to be pretty.
You'd a man, they might say,
and give him a high five.
Suppose now that the same
thing happens but with the
genders reversed.
A 12th-grade girl goes to a
party Friday night and has
unprotected sex with a
college man she's just met,
and then on Saturday night she
goes to another party and has
unprotected sex with a
different man.
If her girlfriends find out
about her exploits, they are
not likely to be favorably
impressed regardless of whether
the men in question are good
looking or not.
They are more likely to think
she's a slut or insanely
reckless or both.
Girls and boys assess risk
differently and they differ in
their likelihood of engaging in
risky behaviors.
As soon as kids are old enough to
toddle across the floor, boys are
significantly more likely to do
something dangerous.
Put their fingers in an electric
socket, try to stand on a
basketball, jump off a chair onto
the floor.
And when parents try to stop
their child from doing something
risky, boys are less likely to
comply.
Studies in the United States and
around the world universally find
that boys are more likely to engage
in physically risky activities.
Boys are more likely than girls to
be seriously injured or killed in
accidents such as drowning, misuse of
firearms, or head injury related to
riding a bicycle.
Psychologist Barbara Morangiello
interviewed children ages 6 through
10 who had been injured or who had
been in close calls.
She found that compared with the
girls, boys were more likely to
attribute their injuries erroneously
to bad luck rather than to any lack
of skill or foresight on their part.
Boys were less likely to tell their
parents about the injury.
Boys were more likely to be around
other boys at the time the injury
occurred.
A boy is more likely to do something
dangerous or stupid when he's with a
group of boys than when he is by
himself.
Lizette Peterson and her associates at
the University of Missouri wanted to
study sex differences in children's
responses to risky situations.
They set up a video game in which kids
rode a stationary bicycle while watching
an interactive video screen.
The simulation was so realistic that when
the bicycle on the screen went under the
branch of a tree, some kids ducked their
heads.
Then the kids suddenly confronted a
hazard.
In some cases, just a coiled garden hose
blocking the path.
In other cases, more dangerous situations,
such as an oncoming car swerving suddenly
from the opposing lane so that the car was
about to hit the kid head on.
The bike was wired so that Peterson and her
colleagues could measure how quickly the
kids stepped on the brake to avoid a
collision.
I wouldn't want to be sitting on the back
of a bike if one of those boys was
riding it.
The boys were much slower to brake than
the girls were.
If the simulation had been real, many of
the boys would have sustained life-threatening
injuries.
The boys were also more likely to report
feeling exhilarated by the simulated
collision, whereas girls were far more
likely to report feeling fearful.
So, one reason many boys engage in
physically dangerous activities may be that
the danger itself gives the activity a
pleasant tingle.
That's a tough concept for some women to
grasp.
A mother who warns her son,
don't ride your bike off the boardwalk,
you might get hurt, has missed the point.
Her son knows it's dangerous.
He's riding his bike off the boardwalk
because it's dangerous.
Researchers at Boston University asked a
simple question.
Why are most drowning victims male?
The data are striking.
Among teenagers 15 to 19 years of age,
boys are 9.8 times more likely to die in a
drowning accident than girls are.
Among young adults 20 to 24 years of age,
young men are 10.4 times more likely to
die in a drowning accident than young women
are.
In other words, among young people 15 to 24
years of age, boys and young men are about
10 times more likely to die in a
drowning accident than girls and young
women are.
How come?
Imagine a group of girls walking along a
Florida beach in summertime.
They see a sign that says,
Warning, Riptide Zone, don't swim here.
Go over there and swim where the lifeguard
is.
Most girls will say,
Hey, we probably shouldn't swim here.
Let's go swim over there where it's safer.
Now, imagine a group of teenage boys walking
along the same beach looking at the same
sign.
There's a good chance that one of the boys
will snort and say,
Riptide?
Ha!
That's just water.
I'm stronger than water.
He plunges in and he may be washed to his
death.
The Boston University psychologists concluded
that a major contributor might be that boys and
young men probably overestimate their swimming
ability, placing themselves in riskier aquatic
situations than women.
By the time the boy discovers his error, it may be
too late.
Likewise, epidemiologists at the University of
Pittsburgh have found that males are much more
likely to die in thunderstorms than females are.
Many of those deaths occur when a flash flood blocks a road.
A female driver encountering a stretch of road under
water is likely to do the sensible thing, turn around
and find another way.
Male drivers, on the other hand, are more likely than
female drivers to drive right into the water and die.
So, that may be another reason why boys are more likely to
engage in physically risky activities.
It seems that boys systematically overestimate their own
ability and or underestimate risk.
Gender stereotypes may be playing a role here.
When kids are asked which child, a girl or a boy, is most
likely to get hurt when riding a bike, climbing a tree, etc.,
girls and boys agree that the girl is more likely to get
hurt.
In fact, the reality is just the opposite.
Boys are more likely to get hurt.
The majority of our entertainment, of our television and movies
and novels and stories and video games, continues to show the boy
saving the girl or the man saving the woman.
There are some exceptions.
One of my favorites is the character of Rey in the latest Star
Wars movies, but they remain exceptions.
That bias toward risk-taking males in the majority of cultural
programming may be partly to blame for boys' overestimation of
their abilities.
But we should be careful before we march down the same road as those
1970s-era scholars who believed that sex differences derive primarily from
cultural influences.
For one thing, a similar phenomenon, the male taking greater risks, has been
observed in primates such as monkeys, baboons, and chimpanzees.
Studying a wildlife refuge for Japanese macaque monkeys, researchers Linda Marie
Fedigan and Sandra Zohar, wanted to find out why there were so many more adult
females than males.
Although the ratio of female-to-male monkeys was roughly one-to-one at birth, by
adulthood, there were as many as five females for every one surviving male.
What happened to all the other male monkeys?
And why isn't a similarly imbalanced sex ratio seen in zoos?
Fedigan and Zohar considered many possible explanations, such as,
The Fragile Male Hypothesis, maybe the males are just more susceptible to
illness and disease, The Predator Hypothesis, maybe the males are not as good at
escaping predators, The Risk Hypothesis, maybe the males engage in more
dangerous behaviors, The Mutant Hypothesis, maybe the males are more likely to carry
harmful mutations.
This is actually a variation on the Fragile Male Hypothesis.
After carefully reviewing 21 years of data, Fedigan and Zohar found support only for the
risk hypothesis.
Males are mainly lost to the population because of their risk-taking behaviors.
Male monkeys do wild and crazy things just like teenage boys.
For example, these researchers found that male monkeys take stupid risks around highways.
They try to scamper across a highway only to be crushed by an oncoming truck.
Female monkeys are much less likely to take the same risks.
They tend to avoid highways.
These differences appear to be largely inborn.
It's hard to argue that male monkeys overestimate their abilities because they've been watching
too much James Bond or playing too many video games.
We have to consider the possibility that the tendency for male primates, including boys and
young men, to do insanely dangerous things may be at least in part innate rather than culturally
programmed.
DARE TRAINING
If you have a son, you need to understand his motivation so you'll be able to keep him from
riding his bike off a cliff.
Parents of daughters need to understand this issue, too, from another perspective.
Most young girls need some encouragement to take risks, the right kind of risks, and to raise their
estimation of their own abilities.
Many gender-based inequities persist in our society.
Men remain far more likely to be CEOs of major corporations despite the fact that there is now a
substantial cohort of equally well-trained women.
Only 26 of the Fortune 500 companies are led by women CEOs, a proportion that hasn't changed much
in the past 30 years.
Consider the gender gap in income.
The average woman in the United States working full-time still earns less than the average man
earns.
Some of that difference is explained by differences in occupation.
The average software engineer with a master's degree in software engineering earns more than the
average elementary school teacher with a master's degree in elementary education.
Most software engineers are men.
Most elementary school teachers are women.
But even when you control for occupation, education, and hours worked, a significant gender gap in pay
persists.
About 92 cents for women for every dollar earned by a man in the same job, according to the most recent estimates.
Men are still getting paid more than women do for doing the same work, on average, in most fields, with a few exceptions.
Actuarial and accounting work, for example, is one of the few fields where men and women do earn the same.
Economist Linda Babcock studied students graduating from Carnegie Mellon University with a master's degree in a business-related field.
She found that the starting salaries of the men were about 8% higher on average than those of the women.
The men were paid about $4,000 more.
Babcock then looked to see who had asked for more money during the job-finding process.
It turned out that only 7% of the female students had asked, compared with 57% of the men.
Controlling for gender, Babcock found that students who asked for more money received a starting salary that was $4,053 higher on average than students who didn't ask.
In other words, the gender gap could be explained by the fact that the women hadn't asked for more money.
Asking for more money when you've just received a job offer is taking a risk.
You might give offense to a prospective employer.
You might give the impression of being greedy.
You might conceivably lose the job or start off in your new job on the wrong foot.
So, most women don't ask.
And those who don't ask, don't get.
To be successful, really successful in business, you have to be willing to take those kinds of risks.
You want your daughter to be able to do that, to take a risk when the moment is right.
How can you empower her to have that kind of self-confidence?
My first suggestion?
Don't do what your neighbors do if your neighbors are typical North American parents.
Parents in North America are more likely to shield their girls from risks and less likely to praise them for engaging in risky activities such as climbing trees or riding a bike hands-free.
I myself have observed enormous differences in the way parents respond when their child is injured.
Fourteen-year-old Jason injured his back playing JV football.
He could barely walk.
Dad helped his wounded warrior stagger into my office.
Dad was concerned, of course, but I also detected a note of pride.
It was a goal-line stand.
They had the ball on our two-yard line, fourth down, fourth quarter.
Jason just threw himself at the running back.
Sacrificed his body totally.
Stopped the other guy cold.
We took over on downs and won the game.
I checked the x-rays.
Everything was fine.
Neurological exam was normal.
I reassured Dad that Jason just had a bad muscle spasm from the injury.
I recommended a few days off from sports, soaking in a warm bath and a muscle relaxant.
Dad's first question?
So when can Jason get back on the field?
I saw a very similar injury in a fourteen-year-old girl playing field hockey.
Tracy also could barely walk.
Both Mom and Dad accompanied Tracy to my office.
Once again, the x-rays were normal.
The neurological exam was normal.
I reassured the parents that Tracy just had a muscle spasm.
I recommended a few days off from sports, soaking in a warm bath and a muscle relaxant,
just as I had for Jason.
Parents' first question?
Do you think Tracy should give up field hockey?
Maybe she's just not cut out for it.
Or at least she should take the rest of the season off?
The difference in the parents' reaction is striking.
It's so remarkable, I've begun calling parents' attention to it.
Suppose Tracy were a boy with the exact same injury.
Would you be thinking about taking your child out of the sport?
I ask them.
No, you wouldn't, I say, while they're still hesitating.
You'd be saying things like, walk it off, work it out.
You can do it.
What are good ways to get girls to be more comfortable with risk-taking?
Margaret Pala Olafsdotir, an educator in Iceland, has developed a program for young girls
that she calls DARE Training.
The idea first occurred to her during a field trip for girls only.
It was a warm day and some of the girls took off their shoes and socks.
On an impulse, she encouraged all the girls to take off their shoes and socks and run around
on the stones and pebbles in the park.
You have to wonder whether a teacher in our more litigious American society would have had
the courage.
Then she dared them to dance.
One girl moaned when a stone hurt her foot.
What can we do instead of complaining when it hurts, Olafsdotir asked the girls.
Sing, suggested one of the girls.
And so we did, Olafsdotir says.
Sang and danced all the way back to the school, barefooted.
We felt like superwomen.
The girls were joyful and proud that they had discovered a new world, Olafsdotir wrote.
Inspired, Olafsdotir hauled mattresses into the girls' kindergarten.
She stacked the mattresses on the floor, put a table next to the mattresses, and encouraged
the girls to jump from the table onto the mattresses with an invitation to scream as they jumped.
Because an important part of the stereotypical female role is to keep quiet, and because noise
is not integrated into girls' play, it became obvious that training in making noise and using
the voice should be part of the daring exercises, Olafsdotir wrote.
Soon, the girls' room was almost as loud as the boys' room.
When the girls said it was too easy to jump from a table onto a mattress, we just put another
table on top of the first one, and at last, a chair on top of everything.
Once the girls understood that they had a teacher who wanted them to take risks, they started
creating their own challenges.
They tossed raw eggs high in the air and caught them without breaking them.
Sometimes.
They squirted one another with water pistols.
One girl built a high wall out of sponge-foam bricks.
What are you going to do?
Olafsdotir asked the girl.
Jump over the wall, the girl shouted back.
The wall was obviously too high, but how could I destroy her faith after months of developing
a new self-image?
Olafsdotir asked herself.
The little girl climbed up, took a deep breath, and jumped directly onto the wall, which collapsed.
The whole group laughed, but our heroine was not sure how she should react and looked
to me for help.
I thought of my own experience of not feeling good enough no matter how hard we try until
at last we stop trying, lose our confidence, and stop taking risks.
That is how we are kept in the old role of passivity and stopped from trying new things.
That little girl had found the perfect way.
We have to train away the old fear of mistakes that holds us back.
I gave the girls exactly this speech, though in different words.
This story highlights a problem with this approach.
If a girl takes a risk and fails, she may end up being more risk-averse, not less.
Olafsdotir acknowledges this hazard.
The feeling of weakness and inability and the tendency to low self-esteem are so integrated
into girls' thinking that this training can be counterproductive if we do not know exactly
what we are doing.
Start with something the girls know they can do, then gradually let them build up that
wall, stretch their abilities to the limit.
Let's go back to Lisette Peterson's study where she rigged up a stationary bike so kids
could ride through a hazardous environment.
Peterson then asked all the parents whether their kids had ever been injured riding a bike,
injured badly enough to require medical attention.
She found that kids who had been injured were less fearful of doing the simulation than kids
who had never been injured, even after controlling for the degree of confidence kids felt riding
bicycles.
She calls this the invulnerability effect.
When a kid has fallen and, let's say, scraped a knee or gotten a cut, they recover.
One week later, that kid is thinking,
Hey, that wasn't so bad.
I got hurt and now I'm fine.
Girls, in particular, benefit from dare training, to use Olaf Stottir's term once again.
Trying to jump over the wall and failing and getting bruised and then discovering that
she can get over it is a good way to build your daughter's courage and inner strength.
Let me give you another example of a dare training program which I observed on my six trips to
Australia, except that they don't call it dare training.
They call it abseiling.
In the United States, we call it rappelling down a cliff.
Lauriston is a girls' school in Melbourne, Australia that I have visited on two occasions.
Girls' schools are much more common in Australia than in the United States.
When the girls are in year nine, our ninth grade, every girl is required to spend the year
at the school's facility at Hauqua, a remote area in the mountainous forest three hours north
of Melbourne near Mansfield.
It's a year of rugged hikes and no mobile phone service.
The girls live in cabins in the woods, and every girl is required to participate in the
abseiling program.
Jen Willis, who was then director of outdoor education at Lauriston, told me about a Lauriston
girl who was quiet and shy.
The girl was very bright and did well in classroom work, although she didn't speak much in class.
She didn't like to raise her hand or to speak in front of others, and when she did speak,
she spoke in a very quiet voice, almost a whisper.
And this girl, let's call her Kira, was terrified of heights.
She begged Ms. Willis not to make her do the abseil down the cliff.
But Ms. Willis insisted, and besides, Ms. Willis didn't have the authority to excuse Kira.
Every girl is required to do the training for the abseil and to do the abseil itself.
No exceptions.
When the big day came, Ms. Willis told Kira,
You go first.
That seemed unkind to me, but Ms. Willis explained it to me this way.
If you're standing at the top of the cliff watching your friends drop over the side one
by one, it can be scary.
The cliff is so steep that you can't even see them once they drop over the side unless
you lean over the side yourself, which I knew Kira would never do.
And if you're afraid of doing the abseil, you may just get more afraid watching each of
the other girls drop over the side.
I knew it would be best for Kira for her to go first.
Ms. Willis must have been right.
Kira did the abseil without any difficulty.
And the very next day, teachers started to notice a difference in the classroom.
Kira began raising her hand.
She began speaking in public.
And when she spoke, it wasn't a whisper anymore.
You could hear what she was saying.
She literally found her voice, to borrow a phrase from Carol Gilligan.
When a teacher asked her why she was now more comfortable raising her hand and speaking out,
she said,
After doing the abseil, it's not so scary to speak in class anymore.
Note that the Lauriston program at HALQUA is mandatory.
There are similar programs at American schools, but in my experience, the American programs
are almost always optional, not mandatory.
As a result, the girls who need them most do not participate.
Kira would never have signed up for this program.
On the contrary, she begged to be let out.
So, if you think your daughter needs a boost to find her voice, I suggest that you find
a program like Lauriston's and sign her up, even if she says she doesn't want to.
In my book, The Collapse of Parenting, I explained that parents must sometimes push their kid to
do things the kid might not want to do.
If your daughter is timid, sign her up for a rock-climbing program.
American parents typically blanch in horror when I suggest that they sign up their risk-averse
daughter for a rock-climbing program over her objections.
I examine this failure to exercise parental authority and how that failure contributes
to the growing fragility and anxiety of American kids in the collapse of parenting.
St. Michael's Collegiate School is a girls' school in Tasmania, Australia,
where the leadership has made a real commitment to the abseiling program,
again believing that it can empower girls to find their voice and take appropriate risks.
Once again, every girl is required to participate in the program,
beginning when the girls are six years old.
Nine years later, the girls can do the abseil down the cliffs at Fresenay National Park,
400 feet above the Pacific Ocean.
If you look in the PDF that accompanies this audiobook,
you can see one of the photos the school gave me.
Look at the girl's face.
She is calm.
Put me in that same situation and I would be a quivering mass of jello.
Such programs are common in Australia.
They are less common here, but you can find them.
And not every girl needs such a program.
You have to know your child.
When it comes to risk-taking, individual differences can be huge.
I met a girl who rides her ATV down a steep, rugged, heavily wooded mountain
about five miles north of my office.
I know a little boy who doesn't want to finger-paint
because he's worried the paint won't come off his fingers.
The girl on the ATV could use some of the hazard precautions that I will describe in a moment.
The boy who doesn't even want to finger-paint could use dare training
or something like Lauriston's program at Hauqua.
Hazard Precautions
What about the boy who gets a thrill out of taking risks?
He skateboards down a banister, or tries to.
He rides his bike off a brick ledge onto the sidewalk.
At the swimming pool, all he wants to do is run at top speed off the highest diving board.
You've already taken him to urgent care three times with injuries,
but the injuries have not fazed him.
Now he's doing aerial skateboard tricks and asking for skydiving lessons.
Each year he wants to do something even more hazardous.
You have nightmares about spinal cord injuries.
What to do?
There are at least three basic principles involved in decreasing the risk of your child experiencing a severe injury.
The first principle, remember the risky shift.
Boys in groups do stupid things that they don't do or are less likely to do when other boys are not around.
Your boy wants a thrill. Great.
Take the whole family skiing or snowboarding.
Insist on everybody having a lesson first, no matter what their level of expertise.
Taking a lesson from an expert will keep your boy in touch with reality
and give him a more accurate assessment of his skills.
He may think he's ready to tackle the black diamond expert slopes.
The teacher can show him that he'll actually have more fun
and be able to do more on slopes that are better suited to his skill level.
A family trip to the ski slopes is a much safer undertaking
than a group of teenage boys going to the same mountain.
The second principle,
supervised is better than unsupervised.
I've seen parents who refuse to let their boy play football because they think it's too dangerous,
but they allow him to practice his skateboarding with his buddies in the parking lot.
I've got news for those parents.
Your son is at much greater risk of injury in an unsupervised setting with other boys
than in any setting where there's a responsible adult in charge.
Boys who enjoy taking risks will take risks.
Yes, there is a risk involved when your son runs out onto a football field.
He's going to collide with players who are bigger and stronger than he is.
But a football practice supervised by a competent coach is a lower-risk environment for serious injury
than a parking lot with a bunch of boys and no adults around.
YouTube is crammed with videos of boys in parking lots doing stunts on the hoods of moving cars
with nobody at the steering wheel.
Your boy will be safer on a football field than he would be in the parking lot with other boys.
The third principle,
assert your authority.
Years ago, Dallas Cowboys cornerback Deion Sanders suffered a concussion
during a game with the Washington Redskins.
The team doctor correctly advised Sanders to stay out for the rest of that game.
When you've suffered a concussion, the brain swells just a bit.
You may feel okay an hour later,
but if you're hit in the head again,
the swelling can be massive,
leading to death in minutes if the increased pressure
causes the hind part of the brain to squirt down into the spinal column.
That's why the doctor told Sanders to sit out the rest of the game.
Sanders disregarded the doctor's advice.
When he felt better, he went back out on the field.
When Sanders returned to the sideline,
the doctor didn't scream or yell.
He simply took Sanders' helmet and walked away.
The doctor kept Sanders' helmet tucked under his arm for the rest of the game.
And today, of course, the NFL has new rules in place
that would formally prohibit Sanders from returning to the game,
but this took place back in 1999.
That's an example of how to assert your authority
with a boy who likes to take risks
and who hasn't abided by the guidelines you have set.
Don't argue.
Don't negotiate.
Just do what you need to do.
If you've told your boy that he's not allowed to ride his mountain bike
down the steep mountain without your permission
and without a grown-up in attendance,
and he's broken that rule,
don't ask him to promise.
When his friends come by
and ask him to go riding down the steep hill again,
he'll look like a wimp if he says,
I can't go because I promised my father I wouldn't
unless we have a grown-up with us.
In the boy code,
honoring a promise made to a parent
may be a sign of weakness.
But the boy code
respects a heavy-duty woven steel cable lock.
So go to the hardware store
and buy a sturdy lock.
That way, when his friends come by
and ask him to go riding,
he can say, quite honestly,
I can't.
My dad put this monster lock on my bike.
When you've decided that your son can ride his bike again,
and you know when, where, and with whom he'll be riding,
including at least one adult,
then unlock it.
The surface of a girl fight can be as silent and smooth as a marble.
Rachel Simmons
Jeffrey
Jeffrey, age 14, was moody, irritable, and depressed.
School annoyed him.
Sports didn't really interest him.
He didn't have many close friends.
The psychiatrist had prescribed an antidepressant plus Ritalin
for attention deficit disorder.
Even with the medication,
Jeffrey was still withdrawn and despondent.
Getting through the school day was a struggle,
even though his parents had enrolled him in a private school
where the classes were small
and the teachers were caring and attentive.
That summer,
Jeffrey's father arranged for him
to spend two months in Zimbabwe.
Jeffrey had been hired as an assistant
to Cliff,
a professional hunter.
Cliff made his living
taking North American and European men
into remote areas of Africa
to hunt wild game.
Jeffrey's parents packed enough medication
to last Jeffrey all summer.
After three days with Jeffrey,
Cliff told him to stop taking the pills.
You don't need them,
Cliff said.
And he was right,
at least as far as hunting
in the African bush was concerned.
Jeffrey could sit for hours,
motionless in the tall grass,
waiting for prey to appear.
The local Ndebele tribesmen
took a liking to Jeffrey.
They could see that he was different
from other American and European tourists.
Jeffrey was comfortable with the locals
and the locals were comfortable with him.
More than anything else,
Jeffrey wanted to learn to hunt
the way the Ndebele men did.
So they taught him
to use their hunting jamaline.
Have you ever tried to hit an archery target
using a bow and arrow?
Imagine that you were trying to hit that target,
but instead of a bow and arrow,
you have only a wooden spear,
twice as long as a baseball bat,
and you have to throw it at the target
from a distance of thirty yards.
After an hour of practicing,
Jeffrey told the tribesmen
that he was ready to hunt.
They chuckled
and pointed at a grouse
about thirty yards away.
Jeffrey stared at the bird,
nodded to himself,
then hurled the javelin
with all his might.
The bird, transfixed by the spear,
was killed instantly.
Everyone was amazed,
except for Jeffrey.
Cliff snapped a picture of Jeffrey
standing on a pile of rocks,
his arms raised in triumph,
holding the dead bird in one hand
and the javelin in the other.
Jeffrey gave me a copy of that picture
when he came back home.
That summer was a turning point,
his mother Jane told me later.
Jeffrey still had to take medication
in order to function well in school,
but his whole attitude had changed
and his depression lifted.
He no longer saw himself as a failure.
That summer gave him confidence,
Jane said.
Now suppose Jeffrey's parents
had not sent him to Zimbabwe.
Suppose they had sent him instead
to Camp ADD,
a summer camp where boys and girls
diagnosed with attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder
spend their summer working on
reading and writing skills.
There are many such camps today,
six weeks indoors in July and August.
Then you go right back to school
in September for more of the same.
If Jeffrey's parents had done that,
he might not have grown up
to be the outgoing and amiable man
he now is.
The great moments of our life
come when we find the courage
to rechristen our evil
as the best within us,
Friedrich Nietzsche once wrote.
The same hidden intensity
and impulsiveness
that had been liabilities
for Jeffrey at school in Maryland
became advantages
when he was hunting
in the wilds of Zimbabwe.
The experience of feeling himself
to be a genuinely gifted
and talented hunter
changed his whole outlook on life.
After he nailed a grouse
at 30 yards
when nobody thought he could do it,
schoolwork didn't seem
so hopelessly difficult anymore.
If you're opposed to hunting,
here's the part
that may not sit well with you.
If Jeffrey had hurled his spear
at a target on a wall,
it wouldn't have had the same effect.
Hitting a target on a wall
wouldn't have changed his life.
The fact that he had killed
a living thing was crucial.
Most women and some men
recoil from that idea,
and I'm not necessarily endorsing it.
But the reality is
that most girls and women
relate to violence
very differently
from how most boys and men do.
Lessons from the Playground
Ever watch kids
playing on a playground?
Psychologist Janet Lever
spent a whole year
at elementary school playgrounds
watching girls and boys play.
Boys fight a lot,
she noticed.
Boys engage in physical violence
about 20 times
as often as girls do.
To her surprise, though,
she found that boys
who fight each other
usually end up being
better friends after the fight.
They are more likely
to play together
in the days after the fight
than they were
in the days before.
Girls seldom fight,
but when they do,
often with words
rather than fists,
the bad feelings last.
I hate you.
I'm never, ever, ever
going to play with you again,
Katie says to Amy,
and the older she is,
the more likely
that she will be true
to her word.
After a big fight
between Katie and Amy,
Amy's group
may not play
with Katie's group
again for the rest
of the school year.
Before you claim
that these differences
are just an artifact
of human culture,
consider that Lever's reports
are similar
to what scientists
have found
with chimpanzees.
Male chimpanzees
are about 20 times
as likely to fight
as females are,
but the fights
don't last more
than a few minutes
and rarely result
in major injury.
Two male chimps
who fight each other
this morning
may be grooming
each other
this afternoon.
According to
Frantz de Waal,
a primatologist
at the Yerkes
National Primate Research
Center in Atlanta,
picking a fight
can actually be a way
for male chimps
to relate to one another,
check each other out,
and take a first step
toward friendship.
Female chimps
rarely fight,
but when they do,
their friendship
is over.
The hostility
that results
can last for years.
Serious injury
is also more likely
to occur
when female chimpanzees
fight.
Female chimps
who have fought
each other
are vindictive
and irreconcilable,
according to
Dr. De Waal.
In our species,
these differences
are apparent
as soon as children
can talk.
Boys as young
as two years of age
given a choice
between violent fairy tales
and warm and fuzzy fairy tales,
usually choose
the violent stories.
Girls as young
as two years of age
most often choose
the warm and fuzzy stories.
In another study,
psychologists found
that five- and seven-year-old
girls who like
to make up
violent stories
are more likely
to have significant
behavior problems
than girls who prefer
warm, nurturing stories.
However,
among boys,
a preference
for making up
violent stories
is not an indicator
of underlying
psychiatric problems.
A preference
for violent stories
seems to be normal
for five- to seven-year-old boys
while the same preference
in five- to seven-year-old girls
suggests a psychiatric disorder.
Psychologists
Louise and David Perry
interviewed girls
and boys
average ten years
asking them
how they might respond
to certain situations.
For example,
suppose you're playing
soccer with your friends
and some other kid
comes and grabs
the ball from you.
Would you hit
the other kid?
If you did hit
the other kid,
do you think
hitting the kid
would get you
the ball back?
And how would you
feel afterward?
Most boys
said that they
would hit the kid
who tried to steal
the ball.
The older the boy,
the more confident
he was that he
would succeed
in getting the ball
back by hitting
the other kid.
And the boys
who said that
they would hit
the other kid
also said
that they would feel
absolutely no guilt
about hitting him.
Why should I
feel guilty?
He took my ball.
They were confident
that other boys
would approve
of their action.
For good reason.
Boys who act
aggressively
usually raise
their standing
in the eyes
of other boys
as long as
their action
is provoked.
That is,
as long as
it's not bullying.
Girls respond
differently.
Not only were
girls less likely
to respond aggressively
to the kid
who stole the soccer ball,
but they were also
more likely
to have misgivings
about responding
aggressively
and be less confident
of a successful outcome.
They were more likely
to anticipate
feelings of guilt
and emotional upset
about hitting someone else,
even in response
to the provocation
of someone
taking away
their soccer ball.
And they did not
expect other girls
to approve
of their action
even though
it was provoked.
Girls who respond
to provocation
with an act
of physical aggression
may lower
their standing
in the eyes
of their peers.
There's good evidence
that at least
some of these
differences
are biologically
programmed.
Some of that
evidence comes
from studies
of girls
with congenital
adrenal hyperplasia,
CAH.
Owing to a genetic
defect
in the adrenal glands,
the adrenal tissues
of a girl
with CAH
produce high levels
of male hormone
while the girl
is still in her
mother's womb.
That male hormone
partially masculinizes
the girl's brain.
When young girls
who have CAH
are offered a toy,
given the choice
of an airplane,
a ball,
military action figures,
Barbie dolls,
or magic markers,
CAH girls
are more likely
to choose
an airplane
or a ball
or the fighting
action figures
and less likely
to choose
the Barbie dolls
or magic markers
compared with girls
without CAH.
When CAH girls
are tested
at age four,
they are found
to have preferences
about halfway
between those
of non-CAH girls
and typical boys.
CAH girls
are more likely
to choose games
of simulated violence
than non-CAH girls
are,
but less likely
to choose violent games
than typical boys
are.
In fact,
the masculinity
of a CAH girl's
choice of toy
is proportional
to the severity
of that girl's CAH.
The more severe
her CAH,
that is,
the more male hormone
her brain was exposed
to before birth,
the more masculine
her behavior
and her toy preferences
will be.
These researchers
also found
no evidence
of parental influence
on the children's
play behavior.
Parents who encouraged
their daughters
to play with more
feminine toys
had zero effect
on their children's
play behavior.
Studies with laboratory animals
show similar
sex differences.
Among most higher mammals
and especially
among our closest
relatives,
the primates,
juvenile males
are more likely
to engage
in rough and tumble
play than females
are.
In one study
of long-tailed
macaques,
for example,
the boy monkeys
were six times
more likely
to engage
in rough and tumble
play than
the girl monkeys
were.
Girl monkeys,
on the other hand,
are more likely
to engage
in what primatologists
call alloparenting.
They're babysitting.
Young female monkeys
are far more likely
than young males
to look after
a baby monkey,
allowing the baby's
mother time off
to forage.
The mother returns
to retrieve the baby
from the babysitter
when it's time
for the baby
to breastfeed.
Among other primates,
you will find
that young females
show much more interest
than young males do
in taking care
of babies.
That's true for baboons
and for rhesus monkeys.
Among wild chimpanzees,
young females
are more likely
to cradle a stick
in their arms
the way a chimpanzee
mother cradles
her baby.
Young male chimpanzees
are more likely
to use the same stick
as a weapon.
Likewise,
in our species,
girls,
on average,
are much more likely
to be interested
in babies
than boys are.
And researchers find
that the difference
in interest level
diminishes
throughout the human
lifespan.
Girls are much more
likely to be interested
in babies
than boys are.
Male interest
in babies
is roughly constant
across the lifespan,
but women over 45
appear to be less
interested in infants
compared with younger women,
teenage girls,
or younger girls.
The researchers
who documented
this finding
concluded that
these differences
suggest
a biological adaptation
for parenting,
a hardwired difference.
That sex difference
does not appear
to be affected
by parents' attitudes
toward their child's behavior.
Sons whose parents
encourage them
to nurture babies
are no more nurturing
than sons of parents
who make no such efforts.
If a similar behavior
is observed
across many different
primate species,
including humans,
then that behavior
probably serves
some biologically
useful purpose.
It's not hard
to see a biologically
useful purpose
of young female primates
feeling drawn
to caring for little babies.
Formal studies
have demonstrated
that the more practice
a young female monkey
has taking care
of a little baby,
the better she will be at it.
But what about
rough-and-tumble play?
What useful purpose
is served
when young males
chase one another
and wrestle,
sometimes for hours on end?
Primatologists
have suggested
two reasons
why young males
spend so much more time
than young females
in rough-and-tumble play.
One reason
is that in many
primate species,
including our closest
relative,
the chimpanzee,
the male is much
more likely to pursue
and kill
moderate-sized prey.
In the wild,
the adult male chimpanzee
commonly hunts,
kills,
and eats monkeys,
while the adult female
chimpanzee
very rarely hunts
such prey,
instead preferring
nuts, berries,
and small invertebrate
species,
such as termites.
Adolescent male chimpanzees
often kill monkeys,
adolescent female chimpanzees
never do.
But there's another reason
researchers believe
why it's useful
for young males
to engage in play fighting.
Wrestling and fighting
with other males
teaches them
the rules of the game.
If young male primates
are deprived
of the opportunity
to fight with other males,
those males grow up
to be more violent
as adults,
not less.
They have never learned
how to get along
with other males
in a playful,
aggressive way.
The rage seems to get
bottled up inside
until it explodes.
And if it's true
for our cousins,
it may be true for us.
In just a moment,
we will consider
proposals offered
by well-intentioned
reformers to ban
dodgeball and snowball-throwing
on the grounds
that such activities
are violent
and aggressive.
The irony is that
if our sons are anything
like their primate cousins,
such measures may not
decrease the likelihood
of serious violent acts.
It might even increase
the likelihood
of the kind of violent outburst
the reformers
are trying to prevent.
Affirm the Night
Aggression has a different meaning
for most girls
than it has for most boys.
For many boys,
aggressive sports,
such as football,
boxing,
wrestling,
may not only be fun,
they may actually form
the basis
for a lasting friendship.
The concept
aggression equals fun
doesn't come naturally
to most girls.
Aggression between girls
doesn't build friendships.
It destroys them.
So it's hard for girls
to imagine
any positive consequences
from aggressive play.
These differences
also affect
how children talk
with one another,
especially with
same-sex peers.
