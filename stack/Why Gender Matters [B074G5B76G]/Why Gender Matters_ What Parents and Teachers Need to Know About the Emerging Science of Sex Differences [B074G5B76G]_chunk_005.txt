Today, it is politically correct to pretend that gender identity and sexual orientation are two completely separate entities.
The mantra that's usually heard is that sexual orientation refers to whom you go to bed with, and gender identity refers to who you go to bed as.
While that may be politically correct, that notion is contradicted by the evidence.
In reality, sexual orientation is inextricably tied up with sexual identity.
With regard to MTF transsexuals, sexual orientation influences everything about the way these individuals deal with their gender identity.
The homosexual MTF transsexual wants to appeal to men, so that individual is likely to pursue electrolysis, breast implants, female hormones, and surgery in an effort to present to the world as convincingly as possible as female.
It's not unusual for a homosexual MTF transsexual to take classes to learn how to move like a woman and talk like a woman.
Yes, women do talk differently from men on average, and it's not primarily about the pitch, higher pitched for women and lower pitched for men.
Women articulate words differently from men on average.
The homosexual MTF transsexual usually presents very early in life, in childhood, as the boy who likes girly things, just as Wyatt slash Nicole Maines did.
The heterosexual MTF transsexual usually does not seek help in transitioning to the female role until adulthood, sometimes not until middle age.
The Olympic champion Bruce Jenner was over 60 years old when he decided to become Caitlyn.
Researchers refer to these types of MTF transsexuals as early-onset and late-onset.
A woman trapped in the body of a man
MTF transsexuals, such as Nicole Maines, say that they are girls trapped in the bodies of boys or women trapped in the bodies of men.
What does the research show?
Let's start with interest in sex.
In the previous chapter, we met Professor J. Michael Bailey and learned about some of his research on gay men and straight men.
He found, for example, that men, both gay and straight, were much more interested in casual sex, sex outside the context of a romantic relationship, than were women, whether straight or lesbian.
Then, Professor Bailey and his team asked MTF transsexuals, homosexual, early-onset, and heterosexual, late-onset, about their interest in casual sex.
The result?
The transsexuals respond pretty much like gay men and straight men.
They like the idea of casual sex.
What about sexual arousal?
As we saw in the previous chapter, women are, on average, equally aroused by sexual pictures of men and sexual pictures of women.
But homosexual MTF transsexuals are aroused only by sexual pictures of men and not at all by sexual pictures of women.
Likewise, heterosexual MTF transsexuals are aroused only by sexual pictures of women and not at all by sexual pictures of men.
These data contradict the current prevailing dogma that these individuals are women trapped in the bodies of men.
In terms of sexual arousal and sexual interest, they look like other men, not like women.
A similar pattern of results has been reported with regard to crime.
After MTF transsexuals transitioned to the female role, they remain just as likely to commit crime, including violent crime, as other men are.
Even though they are living as women, they are six times more likely to be convicted of a crime than are women who were born women.
But when a woman transitions to being a man, she does become more likely to commit a crime.
Individuals who were born female but transitioned to being male, FTM transsexuals, receive testosterone to maintain a male persona.
MTF transsexuals receive estrogen to maintain a female persona.
We can reasonably conclude from these findings that extra testosterone can make you a criminal,
but supplemental estrogen doesn't remove criminal tendencies.
Two chapters back, we learned that gender atypical boys, feminine boys,
have a difference in the androgen receptor gene compared with stereotypically masculine boys.
Researchers have found a similar difference in the same gene in homosexual MTF transgender individuals.
This finding suggests that the homosexual MTF transsexual boy
may just be an extreme version of the gender atypical boy.
That's the conclusion of Professor J. Michael Bailey, who writes,
Only a small minority of gay men become transgender,
but homosexual transsexuals are a type of gay man.
In the previous chapter, I shared research showing that the more older brothers a boy has,
the more likely that boy is to become homosexual.
That's called the fraternal birth order effect, or FBO.
Researchers have found a similar finding in early-onset MTF transsexuals,
but not in female-to-male FTM transsexuals.
The more older brothers a boy has,
the more likely he is to become an early-onset transsexual.
Taken together, these findings strongly suggest that early-onset MTF transsexuals
share more in common with other men, and specifically with gay men, than they do with women.
What about FTM?
There is much less published research on girls who want to be boys
than there is on boys who want to be girls.
But, as is the case with boys who say they are girls,
many girls who say they are boys grow up to be women
who don't think they are men and who don't want to be men.
Scholars study persistence and desistance among transgender individuals.
Persistence means that the child who insists that they are transgender
still insists, as an adult, that they are transgender.
If a girl who believes she is a boy trapped in the body of a girl
grows up to become a woman who believes she is a man trapped in the body of a woman,
that is an example of persistence.
If that girl changes her mind and no longer wants to live as a male
but now prefers to live as a female and feels comfortable as a female,
that is said to be an example of desistance.
Researchers in the Netherlands studied 127 children
who said in childhood that they were transgender.
Either a boy trapped in the body of a girl or a girl trapped in the body of a boy.
The researchers then followed each kid into adolescence.
The average age of each child was about 9 years when first evaluated
and just over 16 years old at follow-up.
Among the boys, 29% said that they were still transgender
and wished to transition to the female role.
Among the girls, 50% said that they were still transgender
and wished to transition to the male role.
At least in this study,
persistence appeared to be more common among FTM individuals,
individuals born female who say they are male,
than it was among MTF individuals,
individuals born male who say they are female.
A team of Canadian researchers also followed girls with gender identity disorder
but with longer follow-up right into adulthood.
In the Canadian cohort,
only 12% of girls who had some kind of gender identity disorder in childhood were persisters.
At follow-up,
88% of females in the Canadian study no longer wanted to be males
and no longer felt themselves to be male.
In 2013,
the American Psychiatric Association discontinued the use of the diagnosis
gender identity disorder,
replacing it with gender dysphoria.
I use gender identity disorder here
because the Canadian researchers used that phrase.
Their paper was published in 2008.
It's unclear why the result of the Netherlands study,
50% persistence,
was so different from the result of the Canadian study,
12% persistence.
One possibility is that the Canadians followed many of the girls well into adulthood.
One of their subjects was 36 years old at follow-up,
whereas the oldest girl in the Amsterdam study was 19 years old at the time of follow-up.
Perhaps some of the persisters in the Amsterdam study
would have become desisters with longer follow-up.
Another possibility is that the Canadian study included girls
who weren't really transgender to begin with.
Yet another possibility is that something about Canadian culture encourages desistance,
or conversely, that something about the culture of the Netherlands
encourages persistence,
or some combination of these two.
Researchers have found a sharp division among MTF transgender individuals,
as we have already discussed.
Early-onset homosexual MTF individuals
and later-onset heterosexual MTF individuals.
There is some hint in the research of a similar division among FTM transgender individuals.
While most FTM individuals present early and are homosexual relative to their sex at birth,
meaning that they want to be intimate with women and not with men,
there is a small proportion of FTM individuals who present later in life
and who are heterosexual relative to their sex at birth,
meaning that they want to be intimate with men and not with women.
Transgender and Mental Illness
Individuals who identify as transgender, whether MTF or FTM,
are at much higher risk of psychiatric disorders such as anxiety and depression
than are non-transgender individuals.
In her biography of Nicole Maines, Becoming Nicole,
author Amy Ellis Nutt acknowledges this reality.
She then asserts,
The dysfunction arises not from their own confusion,
but from being made to feel like freaks or gender misfits.
That's an interesting hypothesis, but it is probably not correct as stated.
More likely, the dysfunction arises both from their own confusion
and from being made to feel like freaks.
Nutt goes on to claim that
there is no way to reconcile this conflict
through psychological counseling or behavioral conditioning.
There is only one way out of this alienation,
and that is transition to the other sex and sex reassignment surgery.
Nutt is perpetuating a popular notion about transgender individuals,
namely that sex reassignment surgery
reliably relieves the mental distress associated with being transgender.
But researchers who have actually studied
transgender individuals post-surgery
have arrived at a different conclusion.
As one investigator found,
even once the transsexual has achieved sex reassignment,
the figure of being trapped in the wrong body,
of being wrongly encased,
continues to be evoked.
Transgender adults who begin receiving hormonal therapy
do benefit on average from that therapy.
One year after starting hormonal therapy
to transition to the desired gender,
the rates of anxiety, depression, and impairment
among transgender individuals are significantly reduced.
Nevertheless,
even after sex reassignment surgery and hormone treatment,
the rate of mental illness,
such as anxiety, depression, and bipolar disorder
among transgender individuals,
remains much higher than among the general population.
Sex reassignment is associated with more serious psychological sequelae
and more prevalent regret than had previously been supposed,
conclude other reviewers.
In the largest and longest follow-up available,
researchers studied everybody who underwent
sex reassignment surgery in Sweden between 1973 and 2003,
191 MTF individuals and 131 FTM individuals.
These investigators found that 19% of MTF clients
and 17% of FTM clients
had been hospitalized for psychiatric problems
prior to undergoing sex reassignment,
compared with less than 4% of matched controls.
After sex reassignment surgery,
transsexual clients were still nearly three times more likely
than controls to be hospitalized for psychiatric problems
other than gender dysphoria,
even after adjustment for prior psychiatric problems.
There was some benefit from sex reassignment surgery,
to be sure.
Transsexuals who had undergone sex reassignment surgery
reported feeling less gender dysphoria,
less of a sense of being trapped in the wrong body,
and were somewhat less likely to be hospitalized
for psychiatric problems
than they were before the surgery.
But only somewhat.
Even after sex reassignment surgery,
transsexual clients were still nearly five times more likely
to have made a suicide attempt
and 19 times more likely to have died from suicide
than were matched controls,
again, after adjusting for prior psychiatric problems.
The researchers did not find any significant difference
between MTF individuals and FTM individuals
on any of these outcomes.
Being transgender, even in Sweden
and even after having sex reassignment surgery,
puts you at much greater risk
of having major psychiatric problems,
including death by suicide.
This finding is consistent with multiple other studies.
Being transgender also puts you at greater risk
of death from natural causes.
Individuals who undergo sex reassignment surgery
have shorter life expectancies years down the road,
long after the scars from the surgery have healed.
There is a graph in the PDF that accompanies this audiobook,
which shows the survival curve for MTF transsexuals
who underwent surgery
and FTM transsexuals who underwent surgery
compared with age-matched male controls
and age-matched female controls.
Each death in the group drops the curve a notch.
The lower the curve, the higher the risk of death.
Control, non-transgender females,
had the best life expectancy
with more than 90% of control females
still alive at follow-up 30 years later.
Control, non-transgender males,
were next,
with just under 90% still alive at 30-year follow-up.
Women who underwent FTM sex reassignment were next.
For much of the follow-up period,
these FTM individuals who were living as men
continued to enjoy the female typical advantage
in life expectancy over MTF transsexuals
who were living as women.
But at 30-year follow-up,
both FTM transsexuals and MTF transsexuals
were much more likely to have died
than were males and females
who were not transsexual.
There is today a widespread assumption
that if a boy says he is really a girl
or if a girl says she is really a boy,
that child will be happier,
healthier,
and more fulfilled
if the grown-ups facilitate a transition
to the other sex.
There is no long-term study
that provides support for this assumption.
Not one.
And there is compelling evidence
that this assumption is often inaccurate.
I recently exchanged emails with Anna's mom.
She informed me that Anna is still transgender
but has recently been hospitalized
as an inpatient in a psychiatric unit.
Of course, Anna also has bipolar disorder.
Was she helped or hurt
by the doctors who prescribed male hormones
for her at her request
shortly after the diagnosis
of bipolar disorder was made?
Being transgender is associated
with a high risk of bad outcomes,
anxiety, depression, and premature death.
Hormonal therapy and sex reassignment surgery
decrease the risk,
but only somewhat.
What are you supposed to do then
if your son insists that he is really a girl
or if your daughter insists that she is really a boy?
The Passion of Dr. Kenneth Zucker
Dr. Kenneth Zucker is one of the world's leading experts
on children with gender dysphoria,
boys who say they are girls
and girls who say they are boys.
For more than three decades,
he directed the Gender Identity Clinic in Toronto,
which specialized in helping such children.
He also is currently editor
of the Archives of Sexual Behavior,
one of the world's leading journals
of research on sex and sexual identity,
a position he has held since 2001.
He was chair of the committee
appointed by the American Psychiatric Association
to create new diagnostic criteria for gender dysphoria,
and he helped to write the latest standard of care guidelines
for evaluation and management of people with gender dysphoria.
He is one of the most widely cited experts
in scholarly papers on gender dysphoria in children.
Dr. Zucker's approach to these kids is gentle and evidence-based.
Begin by getting to know each child
and the child's family as well as you can.
Dr. Zucker describes one boy, whom he calls Frank,
who had an older brother who was bullying him and beating him up.
When he was seven, Frank's parents brought him to the clinic
because Frank was saying that he was really a girl.
Frank said that all boys are mean.
Dr. Zucker suggests that an effective intervention in Frank's case
would focus on helping Frank recognize
that there are a variety of ways to be a boy
and that there are likely some boys in his social environment
who are not pervasively mean or aggressive.
Exposure of Frank to other boys
whose temperament was more a match to his own
could, in theory, help him to develop
a more nuanced understanding of gender,
that there are different ways to be a boy,
that one does not have to be a girl as a fantasy solution
to cope with his difficulties with his aggressive brother.
Dr. Zucker advised gently redirecting kids
away from other gender activities.
If your son wants to play with Barbies,
offer plush animal toys instead.
Focus on developing social skills.
Sign your child up for a group activity like science club.
Don't ever push your child into stereotypical activities
aligned with their biological sex.
Don't force your son to play football
or your daughter to play with Barbies.
Bad idea.
And if you occasionally allow your son
to dress up in a princess outfit,
keep it private.
Don't let the school make him a poster child,
one mother recalls Dr. Zucker telling her.
Don't let them parade him around for pink assemblies.
This is his personal journey
and we don't know where he is going to end up.
Nobody knows whether this particular boy
is going to grow up to be a straight man or a gay man
or whether he will persist in his transgender identity
and become a trans woman.
But if, like the majority of such boys,
he will eventually become an adult man
who doesn't want to be a woman,
then you have done him no favors
by putting him in a dress publicly at age six.
The most common outcome for boys
who say that they are girls
is that they grow up to be gay men.
Accordingly, another major focus of Dr. Zucker's work
was to help parents to support their son
or their daughter,
no matter where the road led.
He encountered many parents who were homophobic.
If a boy overhears his father saying,
I'd rather my son be dead than be gay,
then it just might be easier for the boy to say
and to believe
that he is really a girl trapped in the body of a boy
rather than saying
and acknowledging to himself
that he is a gay boy.
But as I said earlier,
it's very unusual
to find a six-year-old boy
who really understands what it means to be gay.
If he is more familiar with girls than with gay men,
as most young children are,
then it will be easier for him to imagine
becoming a girl than becoming a gay man.
Dr. Zucker knows all about the research
presented in this chapter, of course.
He has seen it firsthand.
He is well aware of the increased risk
of anxiety, depression, social impairment,
and drug use among transgender adults
because he has followed some of his patients
for 30 years or more.
He also knows from firsthand experience
that gender identity in childhood
often is not fixed.
On the contrary,
in the majority of cases,
Dr. Zucker finds that
gender identity can be changed
in the gender dysphoric child.
The XX female who insists she's a boy
can come to become comfortable
in the body of a girl,
perhaps a lesbian girl,
but still a girl.
The XY male who insists that he's a girl
can come to be comfortable in his own body
in the body of a boy,
perhaps a gay boy,
but still a boy.
The gender dysphoria resolves.
With regard to children with gender dysphoria,
Dr. Zucker finds that
the younger the child,
the less fixed gender identity tends to be.
That's why he is strongly opposed
to transitioning children
at age six or age nine.
He has 30 years of research
and clinical experience
and hundreds of case studies
showing that many of these kids
will grow out of it.
On the other hand,
Dr. Zucker is prepared
to support the adolescent
who adamantly insists
on transitioning to the other gender.
In fact,
Dr. Zucker had just been awarded
a $1 million grant
to use MRI scans
to study the brains of teenagers
who were undergoing treatment
with cross-sex hormones
when he was fired.
The morning of December 15, 2015,
Dr. Zucker was summoned
into an administrator's office
at CAMACH,
the Center for Addiction and Mental Health,
Canada's largest psychiatric facility
and Dr. Zucker's employer.
He was told that he was being terminated,
effective immediately,
without notice.
He was not permitted
to return to his office
to get his coat
and his car keys.
Those items were given to him
and he was escorted
off the premises.
CAMACH explained
in a press release
that Dr. Zucker
had been terminated
because his approach
was no longer
in step with the latest thinking.
The latest thinking
refers to what is now called
gender affirmation,
an approach to gender dysphoria
that might be described as
the customer is always right.
If a six-year-old boy
tells you that he is actually a girl,
gender affirmation means
that you change his name
to a girl's name
and send him to school
in a dress
without any careful investigation
to determine
what factors might underlie
this child's gender dysphoria.
Gender affirmation
represents a triumph
of ideology over reality.
In the next and final chapter,
we will consider
what sort of ideology
is involved
and what you need to know
regardless of whether
your child is straight,
gay, lesbian, bisexual, or trans.
Bottom line
As we saw in the previous chapter,
lesbian women and gay men
are normal variations,
just as being left-handed
is a normal variation.
But being transgender
is not a normal variation.
It is a medical condition
that will require
prescription medication,
surgery,
and other interventions
in order for the individual
to achieve their desired goal
of living as the other sex.
And even after making the transition,
the risk of mental illness
and premature death
remains many times higher
than for non-transgender individuals.
As we saw above,
the great majority of boys
who say they are girls
will grow up to be men
who don't want to be women.
Many girls who say
they are boys
will grow up to be women
who don't want to be men.
It follows that
if you have a son
who says he is a girl
or a daughter
who says she is a boy,
you should gently redirect
your son or your daughter
to find other ways,
short of surgery
and prescription hormones,
to accommodate
your child's special needs.
When your eight-year-old son
tells you,
I'm really a girl,
say to him,
I will always love you
no matter who you are,
but for now,
we're not changing your name
and you're not going
to school in a dress.
You're welcome
to take a ballet class
if you like,
but you will study ballet
as a boy,
not as a girl,
at least for now.
If your son thinks
that being a boy
means that you have to
like American football
and violent video games,
then find a wider community
of boys who share
his interests,
whether those interests
be dancing or painting
or scrapbooking.
If your daughter
thinks that being a girl
means you have to like
Disney princesses
and makeup
because that's the only
kind of girl she knows,
then find a wider community
of girls who share
her interests,
whether those be martial arts
or computer programming.
If you have a son
who says he's a girl
or a daughter
who says she's a boy
and you want to seek
professional help,
be on your guard.
Realize that if even
internationally renowned
experts like Dr. Zucker
can be terminated
without notice
for violating
the latest notions
about gender
without regard to evidence,
then your local practitioner
may be vulnerable
and she may act accordingly.
Take the time
to read Dr. Zucker's paper
in which he explained
his approach in detail.
Its title is
A Developmental
Biopsychosocial Model
for the Treatment of Children
with Gender Identity Disorder.
You can purchase it
from the publisher
for $40
and I think it's
well worth the price.
There's more than one way
to be a woman.
There's more than one way
to be a man.
Help your son
to become the man
he was meant to be.
Help your daughter
to become the woman
she was meant to be.
This advice,
which would have seemed
trivial and obvious
twenty years ago,
is now controversial
because our culture
has become immersed
in a peculiar confusion
that I call
the male-female mistake.
Chapter 12
The Male-Female Mistake
Ladies and gentlemen,
skanks and pimps.
Several years ago,
two high school boys
in Steubenville, Ohio,
were convicted
of raping a 16-year-old girl
while she was drunk
and unconscious.
The crime was documented
by their friend,
Evan Westlake.
Westlake's videos
were circulated to friends
and posted on Instagram
and YouTube.
When the two boys
pleaded not guilty,
the videos were among
the evidence used
to convict them.
Mr. Westlake
was granted immunity
in return for cooperating
as a witness for the state.
There is, unfortunately,
nothing new
about teenage boys
sexually assaulting
a drunk teenage girl.
What was bizarre
about this case
was that almost nobody
involved early on,
neither the two boys
nor their friends
who reposted the photos
and the videos,
nor the coaches
who defended the boys,
almost nobody,
seemed to have any sense
that the boys
had done anything wrong.
Ohio Attorney General
Mike DeWine
described encountering
unbelievable casualness
about rape and sex,
the belief that somehow
there isn't anything wrong
with any of this.
Where did this come from?
Around the time
of the Steubenville trial,
coincidentally,
the New York Times
published a column
by Lynn Messina,
a regular contributor,
in which she complained
about a teacher
at her four-year-old son's
preschool who taught her
something about
what it means
to be a gentleman.
Ms. Messina was angry
that a teacher
at her son's preschool
would dare to use
the word gentleman.
In Ms. Messina's opinion,
teaching girls and boys
to be ladies and gentlemen
is a first lesson in sexism.
She admitted that
when she shared her concern
with other parents,
not all agreed.
What's the harm
in teaching little boys
to respect little girls?
they asked.
I would ask the same question.
If you fail to teach
little boys
to respect little girls,
some years later,
you are likely
to have teenage boys
who do not respect
teenage girls.
But Messina had no doubts
about the rightness
of her position.
The very suggestion
of ladies and gentlemen
for her
implies a double standard
of behavior
that
offends me as a mom,
but
it's nothing compared
with how much
it infuriates me
as a feminist.
Indeed,
I have found
that Messina's position
has become
the accepted wisdom
at many leading universities
in the United States
where you will not find
any suggestion
of teaching students
to be ladies and gentlemen.
These universities
often advise students
to obtain
explicit verbal consent
before engaging
in any intimate
or sexual act.
Those policies
are grounded
in legalistic notions
of rights and torts,
not in any moral vision.
In my visits
to schools,
I have sometimes
conducted group conversations
with teenagers
on this topic.
On one occasion,
I asked students,
what does it mean
to be a gentleman?
One teenage boy
answered,
a gentleman
is someone
who goes
to gentlemen's clubs
to watch women
take their clothes off.
He was trying
to get a laugh
from his peers,
but underneath
the veneer,
one finds
merely ignorance.
They truly
don't know
any answer
that has substance.
When I press them
for a serious answer,
they offer descriptions
that are all
about superficials.
A gentleman
wears a three-piece suit.
I don't blame
those boys.
How should they know
any substantive answer
if they have received
no instruction?
No boy
is born a gentleman.
Boys have to be taught.
We used to teach them.
We no longer do.
The result is,
predictably,
boys who have
no idea
of what it means
to be a gentleman.
Boys whose sense
of right and wrong
is mostly about
what's right for me
and what's harmful
to me.
When the two boys
in Ohio
heard the judge
pronounce the guilty
verdict,
one of the boys,
Malik Richmond,
sobbed,
my life is over.
Perhaps.
But what about
the victim?
Does Richmond
still have no regret
about what he did
to her?
Or does he merely
regret being caught?
The message
some boys
will take away
from the verdict
in the Ohio
rape case
may be merely,
don't take photos
or video
of anything
you do with a girl
and don't send
texts about it.
They are not
learning to be
gentlemen.
They are learning
to hide the evidence.
My warning
to Messina
and other critics
of teaching girls
and boys
what it means
to be ladies
and gentlemen,
be careful
what you wish for.
The popular culture
of young Americans
today is quickly
becoming a culture
nearly devoid
of ladies
and gentlemen.
But what has
replaced ladies
and gentlemen
is not the neutered
virtuous citizen
that Messina assumes
will be the result
of gender-blind instruction,
but rather a culture
of skanks
and pimps.
Girls who think
they have to get drunk
in order to be cool
and boys who think
that the best thing
to do with an unconscious
girl is to molest her.
I am not recommending
a return to the 1950s.
That era was racist
and sexist.
We need to create
a new understanding
of what it means
to be a lady
or a gentleman.
A lady has respect
for herself
and for her own body.
That means
she doesn't pose
nude or semi-nude
photos of herself
on Instagram
for strangers to see.
A gentleman
never takes advantage
of a woman
when the woman
is drunk,
no matter what.
These rules
are gender-specific
because men and women
experience
different temptations.
Some men
may be tempted
to fondle a woman
who is drunk
and unconscious
lying in a pool
of her own vomit.
Many porn sites
offer just these
sort of images.
Google
sexy girl
drunk vomit
if you dare
and you will get
more than
one million hits.
Most women
do not feel
strong temptations
to fondle the genitals
of a man
who is drunk
and unconscious
lying in a pool
of his own vomit.
We do no one
any favors
by pretending
that these male-female
differences do not exist.
Ignoring reality
always comes at a cost.
In order to affirm
that a gentleman
has obligations
different from those
of a lady,
you must also affirm
that gender matters
and that gender
is real,
that 99.98%
of humans
are either male
or female.
that reality
is now
under attack.
The War
on Male
and Female
Judith Butler
is a professor
at the University
of California
at Berkeley.
She believes
that we should
challenge
the traditional
division
of the human race
into male
and female.
In the name
of personal freedom,
Professor Butler
encourages individuals
to construct
their own gender
identity
without regard
to their biological
sex.
According to Butler,
notions such as
boy and girl,
man and woman,
father and mother,
are all mere
inventions
of a sexist society
created in order
to support
the patriarchy
and heteronormativity,
the preference
for straight people
over gay
and lesbian people.
Butler herself
is a lesbian.
Butler has been
awarded
the Guggenheim Fellowship,
the Rockefeller Fellowship,
and the Andrew W. Mellon Award,
a $1.5 million prize,
among many other honors.
Butler and her followers,
and they are now Legion,
show no awareness
of sex differences
in vision,
sex differences
in hearing,
sex differences
in risk-taking,
or sex differences
in sex itself.
An international conference
recently concluded
that all claims
of hardwired differences
between men and women
are based on
prejudices
and stereotyped roles
for men and women.
They did not attempt
to refute
any of the research
documenting hardwired
male-female differences
in hearing,
vision,
risk-taking,
etc.
The elites
at the conference
showed no interest
in any of the research
or even any awareness
of it.
Their theorizing
is almost entirely
driven by ideology.
But their theorizing
is now
the dominant worldview
at many leading universities
in the developed world.
Butler was not the first
to argue
that the male-female
distinction is harmful.
A pioneer in the field
was Sandra Bem,
who was a professor
of psychology
at Cornell
for more than 30 years.
Dr. Bem was convinced
that masculine boys
and feminine girls
were likely to have
all kinds of problems
because they were stuck
in traditional notions
of male and female.
Dr. Bem believed
that boys
would benefit
from being more feminine
and girls would benefit
from being more masculine.
Dr. Bem's beliefs
were very influential
in the 1980s
and 1990s
and continue
to be widely accepted today.
But a few researchers
had the courage
to test Dr. Bem's beliefs.
They surveyed
a large group of kids
to determine
how gender-typical
or atypical
each kid was.
They also measured
how satisfied
each girl
and each boy
was with their gender,
separately from
whether the child
was gender-typical
or atypical.
They then followed
the kids for a year
to see whether a kid
who was gender-typical
would become more anxious
or develop
lower self-worth,
as Dr. Bem would predict.
The results
were just the opposite
of what Dr. Bem's theories
would lead you to expect.
Gender-typical kids,
both girls and boys,
were less likely
to become anxious
and had higher self-worth
compared with
gender-atypical kids.
Separately,
kids who were content
with their gender
also were found
to develop
higher self-worth
and were also
more likely
to become more popular
with their peers
compared with kids
who were not content
with their gender.
The authors concluded
that their results
pose a serious challenge
to a conceptualization
of gendered self-concept
that has dominated
the field
for the past
quarter-century,
BEMS.
These researchers found
that being content
with your gender
predicted good outcomes
separate from being
gender-typical.
Likewise,
these researchers found
that kids who reported
pressure to conform
to gender stereotypes
were more likely
to become anxious.
From this research,
we can reasonably conclude
that a sensible,
evidence-based approach
to parenting a girl
or a boy is to help
your daughter or your son
to be comfortable
being a girl
or a boy, respectively.
But don't pressure
your daughter or your son
to conform to gender stereotypes.
If your son wants
to take ballet classes
or learn macrame,
as I did,
cheer him on.
If your daughter wants
to study martial arts
and computer programming,
sign her up.
Teach your son
that there are all kinds
of men in the world,
including men who excel
at ballet and macrame.
Teach your daughter
that there are all kinds
of women in the world,
including women
who are masters of karate
and computer programming.
Unfortunately,
that's not what's happening.
Throughout the developed world,
there is now
a growing tendency
to ask whether the boy
who loves ballet
or the girl
who likes violent combat
might possibly be transgender.
Rather than counseling
these kids
and helping them
to become more content
with their gender,
a growing number
of schools and universities
are promoting
what they call
the trans revolution,
the embrace
of all things transgender.
The writer
and cultural critic
Lionel Shriver
observes that
many elementary schools
now sponsor
transgender days,
the way that schools
used to sponsor bake sales.
I recently received
an email
from an administrator
at a highly selective
university.
We were negotiating
an upcoming
speaking engagement.
At the end of her email
under her name
and alongside
her university affiliation
was written,
My preferred pronouns
are she,
her,
hers.
This practice
is becoming widespread.
Liz Race
is a professor
of gender studies
at the City University
of New York.
She writes
that at some universities,
it's now common
for students
to introduce themselves,
whether in class
or in student group meetings
by name,
followed by a string
of pronouns.
I'm Lizzie,
she,
her,
hers,
for example.
This may seem
enlightened to some,
but it is not.
It is harmful.
It makes gender
a problem.
It makes being female
or male
the boring,
conformist option
and being transgender
the enlightened,
creative option.
It actively encourages
kids to wonder
about their gender identity,
to be less content
with their gender,
even though we have
good evidence
that kids who are not
content with their gender
are more likely
to become anxious
or depressed.
It leads to confusion
about what it means
to be a man
or a woman.
The traditional constructions
of femininity
and masculinity
are now under attack.
In one classroom
in California,
a male teacher
was meeting
with a group of boys,
sharing with the boys
his ideas
about what it means
to be a good man.
The teacher said,
We talked about strength
and we talked about
self-control
and being able
to control your emotions
and making sacrifices
for others.
You know,
we talked about
if you have a family
and you only have enough money
for two cheeseburgers,
you're not going to eat.
You know you're going
to feed your wife
and your kids
and you wait.
Unfortunately
for this teacher,
three scholars
hired by the Ford Foundation
were observing
his classroom.
The scholars
condemned this teacher
for daring
to reinforce
traditional notions
of gender.
The scholars
were disappointed
that the boys
were told
that they should learn
to be strong men
and take care
of their wives.
In most cases,
traditional gender role
stereotypes
were reinforced
and gender
was portrayed
in an essentialist manner.
This teacher
was trying
to provide the boys
with a healthy image
of what a man
should be.
He told them
that the husband,
the father,
should wait
to eat
until he's taken
care of his wife
and kids.
He was trying
his best
to give those boys
some guidance,
some idea
of what it means
to be a man.
Not all
traditional gender roles
deserve to be condemned
as gender stereotypes.
There are
life-affirming
gender roles
and there are
gender stereotypes
that are harmful
and destructive.
The dumb blonde
is a negative
and destructive
gender stereotype
as is the dumb jock.
But no one
should condemn
the ideal
of the husband
and father
who sacrifices
himself for the sake
of his wife
and children.
Instead,
that ideal
should be affirmed
as a role model,
as one among several.
Deconstructing
all images
of the ideal
husband and father
is not likely
to result
in a father
who insists
on his wife
sharing equally
in all sacrifices.
The result
is more likely
to be a selfish
young man
who doesn't
feel any
strong obligation
to the children
he has fathered.
In the United States,
more than 40%
of babies
are now born
to unmarried women.
The growing trend
away from married
couples with children
cuts across
almost all
demographic boundaries.
Married couples
with one or more
children now constitute
less than 20%
of American households.
What I find troubling
about the scholar's
condemnation
of that teacher
in California
is their willingness
to reject
the traditional
role of father
as self-sacrificing
provider
while putting
nothing in its place.
These educated elites
have no suggestions
for what boys
should be taught
about becoming a man.
Their suggestions
are entirely negative.
Boys should not
be taught
to be traditional
husbands and fathers.
But nature
abhors a vacuum.
If the grown-ups
do not provide
positive instruction
for boys
then boys will
turn to the internet
and to social media
for guidance.
And what they find
there is a culture
of disrespect.
A culture
in which it's cool
for boys
to play violent
video games
and surf the web
for pornography.
Gender is a reality.
Gender matters.
You can ignore
that reality
if you like
but ignoring it
doesn't make it
go away.
When girls and boys
are given no guidance
the result often
is girls
who present themselves
as sexual objects
and boys who engage
in reckless
physical risk-taking.
As we saw
in the chapter
on risk
that particular default
reckless physical
risk-taking
for boys
appears to be
hardwired across
various species
of primates
including our own.
Preaching to children
about the harms
of risk-taking
has little proven
benefit in terms
of diminishing
risk-taking
among susceptible
boys.
The key
to successful
outcomes
is not
to ignore
gender
but to guide
and inform
your child's
development
into constructive
rather than
self-destructive
channels.
Ignoring gender
and pretending
that gender
doesn't matter
has not yielded
a utopian culture
of virtuous citizens.
What it has produced
instead is a
confused culture
in which girls
and boys are trying
to figure out
on their own
without adult guidance
what it means
to be a real man
or a real woman.
One common result
of that confusion
is boys playing
violent video games
while girls
send sexy photos
via Snapchat.
Gender is more
fragile than we knew.
Though perhaps
we should have
known better.
Most cultures
have taken great care
in teaching gender norms.
We no longer do.
On the contrary,
our learned professors
now actively deconstruct
and tear down
every gender guidepost
in the name
of individual liberty
with no awareness
of the costs.
We need to be careful
about the norms
we teach, of course.
We don't want
to perpetuate stereotypes
like the dumb jock
or the dumb blonde.
We need to create
new ideals of manhood
and womanhood
that make sense
in the 21st century.
But personhood
won't fly.
Boys don't want
to be persons.
Neither do girls.
Boys want to be men.
Girls want to be women.
We have to teach them
what that means.
Is gender
a social construct?
Simone de Beauvoir,
the celebrated
feminist author,
famously wrote
that a woman
is not born,
she is made.
In other words,
gender is just
a social construction,
an invention of society,
completely malleable.
That assertion
became a staple
of the feminist movement
and of gender studies.
But in just the past few years,
the mainstream consensus
has added a footnote.
Gender is just
a social construction,
completely malleable,
unless you happen
to be transgender,
in which case
your gender identity
is inviolate,
hardwired,
and impossible to change.
This claim,
like de Beauvoir's
original assertion,
is based less
in science
than in ideology.
The contradiction
between these two positions
has contributed
to a growing tension
between traditional feminists
and the transgender community.
Transgender activists
have been vocal
in their claim
that an XY male
who transitions
to the female role
is just as much
a woman
as a woman
who was born
an XX female.
Trans women
are women,
period,
is one of the slogans
employed by the activists.
Male-to-female activist
Mari Briga
asserts that
anyone who describes
a trans woman,
a male-to-female transsexual,
as biologically male,
is a bigot.
For Briga
and other activists,
having male XY chromosomes
and a penis
and testicles
is irrelevant.
A trans woman
is a normal variation,
just another way
of being a woman.
For the transgender activists,
gender is all about
how you feel.
If you feel yourself
to be a woman,
then you are a woman.
Transgender activists
use the acronym
TERF,
Trans Exclusionary Radical Feminist,
to describe feminists
who don't agree
with their claim
that a trans woman
is just another way
of being a normal woman.
Transgender activists
have lobbied successfully
for women's colleges
to admit trans women.
They have stopped
production of the play
The Vagina Monologues
at some women's colleges,
arguing that a play
about women
who have vaginas
excludes trans women
who don't have vaginas.
Mount Holyoke College,
a women's college
in Massachusetts,
dutifully agreed
no longer
to present the play.
The Mount Holyoke
Theater Group
explained that a play
with a title like
The Vagina Monologues
is inherently reductionist
and exclusive.
Aaron Murphy,
chair of the theater group,
wrote that the play
offered an
extremely narrow perspective
on what it means
to be a woman.
The feminist journalist
Eleanor Burkett responded,
Let me get this right.
The word vagina
is exclusionary
and offers
an extremely narrow
perspective on womanhood.
So the 3.5 billion
of us who have vaginas
along with the trans people
who want them
should describe ours
with the politically correct
terminology
trans activists
are pushing on us,
front hole
or internal genitalia?
Traditional feminists
argue that individuals
who have lived
most of their lives
as men
simply haven't had
many of the defining
experiences
that most women
have had.
For example,
transgender women
can't menstruate
or become pregnant.
In her essay
for the New York Times
titled
What Makes a Woman?
Burkett wrote,
People who haven't lived
their whole lives
as women
shouldn't get
to define us.
That's something
men have been doing
for much too long.
Their truth
is not my truth.
Here's what's peculiar
about the debate
between the traditional feminists
and the transgender activists.
Both sides are mistaken
about some basic facts.
The feminists
are mistaken
in their claim
that gender
is primarily
a social construct,
an invention of society.
In reality,
gender is not
primarily
a social construct.
It is a biological fact
of our species
just as it is
for gorillas
and chimpanzees
and every other primate.
That is not to say
that all girls
are alike
any more than it is
to say
that all female chimps
are alike.
Some female chimps
kill and eat monkeys.
Most female chimps
do not.
Many male chimps
kill and eat monkeys
though a few do not.
A primate researcher
who ignored
these differences
would be a poor researcher.
But a researcher
studying humans
who dares to highlight
similar differences
among humans
and to suggest
that those differences
might be hardwired,
as they clearly are
in chimpanzees,
is now likely
to be denounced
as a reactionary tool
of the patriarchy.
It is now common
to hear educated people
refer to biological sex,
female or male,
as being
assigned at birth.
For example,
schools and universities
refer to transgender
individuals
as people
who identify
themselves
as belonging
to a gender
different from
the gender
assigned at birth.
But gender,
male or female,
is not assigned
at birth.
It is more accurate
to say that gender
is recognized
at birth.
When the obstetrician
delivers a newborn,
sees a penis,
and announces,
it's a boy,
that is not
an arbitrary assignment,
but the recognition
of a fact.
In rare cases,
when an intersex child
is born with
ambiguous genitalia,
the sex of the child
may be difficult
to recognize.
As I explained
in the chapter
on intersex,
the contemporary standard
of care is to wait
until the correct gender
can be recognized.
Such cases are,
as I explained,
extremely rare,
less than 2 out of
10,000 live births.
The transgender activists
are mistaken
in their claim
that being transgender
is a normal variation,
no different
from being left-handed.
A boy,
an XY male,
who becomes convinced
that he is a girl
trapped in the body
of a boy,
has a serious problem.
The notion
that you can fix
his problem
by pretending
that he is actually
an XX girl
rather than an XY boy
is contradicted
by the evidence
we considered
in the previous chapter.
For many of those boys,
submitting to their belief
may not be
in their best interest
at all
and may increase
the risk of bad outcomes,
as it did for Mike Penner.
Recall from the previous chapter
that Mike Penner
was the sports writer
who transitioned
to being a woman
and had regrets
and ultimately
committed suicide.
Gender is not alien
to human nature,
nor is it accidental,
nor is it an arbitrary
invention of society.
It is close to the core
of human identity.
Gender matters.
As the author
G.K. Chesterton wrote,
You can free things
from alien or accidental laws,
but not from the laws
of their own nature.
Do not free a camel
of the burden
of his hump.
You may be freeing him
from being a camel.
Do not go about
as a demagogue
encouraging triangles
to break out
of the prison
of their three sides.
If a triangle
breaks out
of its three sides,
its life comes
to a lamentable end.
If you encourage
a boy
to break out
of the prison
of being a boy
and to transition
to being a girl,
you may not succeed
in creating
a happy,
well-adjusted girl.
As we saw
in the previous chapter,
long-term outcomes
for individuals
who undergo
sex reassignment
are not uniformly positive.
You are more likely
to be successful,
based on the evidence
we have available,
if you help that boy
to become more comfortable
being a boy,
which may require
that you broaden
his understanding
of what it means
to be a boy.
Being a boy
doesn't have to mean
liking football
or playing rough-and-tumble games.
It can include ballet
and knitting
and scrapbooking.
The contemporary assumption
that every such boy
will be better off
in the long term
if we put him in a dress,
castrate him,
and give him female hormones
does not have strong basis
in evidence.
Some tips.
Be patient
with other grown-ups.
I have found
that many people,
not just kids,
are now seriously confused
about gender.
If you encounter
a physical education instructor
or camp counselor
who thinks every boy
should enjoy
whacking other kids
with lightsabers,
but your son
doesn't like to hit
or be hit,
then you should talk
to the instructor
and explain
that there are
different kinds of boys
and that's okay.
Lend the instructor
your copy of this book
with instructions
to read chapter 9.
Don't preach.
If your neighbors
have a four-year-old boy
who insists
that he's a girl
and they decide
to start dressing
their son in girls' clothes
and insist
that you now call him
Emily instead of Jason,
don't give unsolicited advice.
Unless they have asked
for your opinion,
don't pester them
about the studies
we considered
in the previous chapter
showing that most boys
who say they are girls
grow up to be men
who don't want
to be women.
Your neighbors
aren't likely
to listen to you
and there's a good chance
that you will create
tension where there
used to be friendship.
Focus on your own child.
For your own child,
you can be
a fearless advocate,
but it's not your job
to educate other parents
about the new science
of gender differences.
If you insist
on offering advice
when you haven't
been asked to,
you aren't likely
to accomplish much.
With regard to gender
and the understanding
of gender,
our culture is going
in the wrong direction
and the changes
are being driven
not by science
but by ideology.
Again,
quoting Lionel Shriver,
We are in the process
of taking a giant
cultural step backwards.
The women's liberation
movement of my adolescence
advocated a release
from gender roles
and now we are
entrenching them,
pigeonholing ourselves
with picayune precision
on a continuum
of gender identity
as if arriving
at the right relationship
to cliché
is tantamount
to self-knowledge.
Shriver writes
that as a girl,
she
scrabbled in the dirt
with my brothers,
playing with model cars
and making toy trains
crash spectacularly
from a height.
I shunned Barbies
and detested baby dolls.
I reviled dresses,
spurning lace
and flounces
for jeans
and flannel shirts.
At fifteen,
I changed my name
from Margaret
to Lionel.
Were I to have grown up
fifty,
sixty years later,
it's entirely possible
that my parents
would have taken me
to see a therapist
and put me
on hormone therapy?
Even in the scholarly literature,
gender non-conforming
is becoming
almost a synonym
for transgender.
The girl
who likes to whack
other kids
with lightsabers
and scrabble in the dirt
is now likely
to be asked
whether she might not
prefer to be a boy
instead of a girl.
There's been
an explosion
in the proportion
of people
who identify
as transgender.
The fourth edition
of the DSM,
the American Psychiatric
Association's
Diagnostic and Statistical
Manual of Mental Disorders,
published in 1994,
stated that
there are no recent
epidemiological studies
to provide data
on the number
of transgender individuals
in the United States,
but that studies
in Europe
showed that
one per 30,000
adult males
and one per 100,000
adult females
seek sex reassignment
surgery.
We do have a study
from the Netherlands
published in 1993
in which researchers
estimated a prevalence
of one out of every
11,900 males
seeking to transition
to being a female
and one out of every
30,400 females
seeking to transition
to being a male,
a prevalence
that the authors
themselves described
as relatively high
in comparison
with other countries.
A prevalence
of one in 10,000
works out
to 0.01%.
Things have changed
since the 1990s.
In 2011,
the estimated prevalence
of transgender individuals
in the United States
was 0.3%.
By 2016,
just five years later,
that proportion
had more than doubled
to more than 0.7%.
I just received
a medical journal
in the mail.
An article in the journal
suggested that the true
incidence of transgender
might be as high
as 5%.
If the correct figure
is indeed now 5%,
that would represent
a 500-fold increase
in less than 30 years.
5% is 500 times 0.01%.
Some have suggested
that this rapid
and astonishing rise
reflects the declining stigma
associated
with being transgender.
Those advocates claim
that lots of transgender people
have always been with us,
but that now they feel free
to come out of the closet.
As someone who has been
a medical doctor
for more than 30 years,
I am not convinced.
For 18 years,
I ran a primary care
medical practice
in suburban Maryland,
which I grew from 0
to more than 7,000 patients,
almost every one
of whom I met personally,
most of them
on multiple occasions.
We had many gay
and lesbian patients,
a few of whom confided
their sexual orientation
only to me,
not even to their
straight spouse.
If transgender individuals
comprised even 0.7%
of the population,
then roughly 49 of our patients,
0.7% of 7,000,
should have been transgender.
There wasn't even one.
If the rise in the proportion
of the population
identifying as transgender
isn't due to people
who were always transgender
coming out of the closet,
then how to explain it?
One part of the answer
may simply be the confusion
surrounding the word transgender.
Lindsay Collin
and her colleagues
recently reviewed 27 studies
of the prevalence
of transgender individuals.
They found that
if you define transgender
to mean strictly
individuals who wish
to become members
of the opposite sex,
females who want
to become males,
and males who want
to become females,
then the best estimate
of prevalence
is 9 per 100,000,
which works out
to just under 0.01%.
But if you define
transgender more loosely
to mean that you
feel yourself
to be a member
of the opposite sex,
but you're not necessarily
planning to transition
to being a member
of the opposite sex,
then the prevalence
soars to 871 per 100,000,
which works out
to 0.87%.
At least part of the rise
in the prevalence
of individuals
who say that they are transgender
may be a change
over the past decade
in what people understand
the term transgender to mean.
Ten years ago,
transgender might have meant
that you planned
to transition
to presenting yourself
as a member
of the opposite sex.
Today, for many people,
transgender may just mean
that you feel yourself
to be a member
of the opposite sex,
whatever that means.
The male-female mistake
Do you feel yourself
to be a member
of the opposite sex?
I am uncomfortable
with the phrase
the opposite sex.
Throughout this book,
I have shared with you
a great deal of evidence
that the average boy
is different
from the average girl
in many ways.
But on most
of these parameters,
the average boy
is not the opposite
of the average girl,
just different.
And there's lots
of variation among boys
and lots of variation
among girls
as we saw
especially in Chapter 9.
But opposite?
Apples and oranges
are different from each other,
but they are not
the opposite of each other.
They are both fruits.
They are both nourishing
and good for you,
though in somewhat
different ways.
Oranges are a better
source of vitamin C
and folic acid.
Apples are a better
source of catechin
and pectin.
They are not the same.
If you try to make
an apple pie
using oranges
instead of apples,
you will be disappointed
with the result.
The notion of
the opposite sex
assumes that you are
either masculine
or feminine.
It assumes
a one-dimensional continuum.
Feminine?
Masculine?
But researchers
have known
for more than 40 years
that that notion
just isn't accurate.
Gender isn't
one-dimensional.
It's two-dimensional.
See the chart
in the PDF
that accompanies
this audiobook
that shows
a two-dimensional
relationship
between feminine,
androgynous,
undifferentiated,
and masculine.
A particular human
can be very feminine
or not,
very masculine
or not,
both feminine
and masculine,
that's androgynous,
or neither feminine
nor masculine,
that's undifferentiated.
In reality,
most of us
are scattered
somewhere on this
two-dimensional plane.
We're all a mix.
A particular girl
might be more masculine
than she is feminine
while a particular boy
might be more feminine
than he is masculine.
Differences do not imply
an order of rank.
A feminine girl
isn't better or worse
than a masculine girl.
A tomboy.
They're just different.
We should celebrate
those differences.
They expand the range
of human experience,
making all of us
more three-dimensional,
more real.
In my own marriage,
my wife fixes
the lawn tractor
and does most
of the outdoor chores
while I shop
for groceries.
I like to shop
for groceries
and she doesn't.
She enjoys
fixing the tractor
while I wouldn't
know where to begin.
But she has a much
better eye for colors
than I do
and I am better
at targeting
a moving object
than she is.
People are a mix.
If you're a parent,
you want to help
your child to find
their own spot
on this two-dimensional map.
Professor Sandra Bem
believed that we
should encourage
every child
to be androgynous,
an equal mix
of male and female.
As we have seen,
Dr. Bem's assumption
that androgyny
is best for every child
doesn't stand up
well to empirical test.
Some kids are happy
being androgynous,
but most kids
are happier
somewhere else
on the two-dimensional plane.
Some boys are happier
being more feminine
than masculine,
although they still
have masculine elements.
Some girls are happier
being more masculine
than feminine,
although they still
have feminine elements.
The explosion
in the proportion
of people
who believe
that they are transgender
may well represent
a failure
to understand
that gender
is two-dimensional,
not one-dimensional.
If you are a man
who has some
or many feminine qualities,
or you are a woman
who has some
or many masculine qualities,
that doesn't mean
that you are transgender.
It means that
you are a human being.
Although many aspects
of gender
are hardwired,
gender identity itself
is more fragile
than we knew.
A man may see
like a man,
hear like a man,
and experience
sexual desire
as a man,
gay or straight.
But if he finds himself
in a culture
that promotes
an either-or
construction of gender,
either you're a guy
who loves football
and worldwide wrestling,
or you're a girl
who loves makeup
and prom dresses,
then he may conclude
that he is transgender.
He is mistaken.
He is confused
by the culture
in which he is immersed,
a culture that has
an impoverished,
binary,
either-or understanding
of gender.
We can call that
the male-female mistake,
the notion
that you have to be
either a tough guy
who loves fighting
and street racing,
or a girly girl
who cries over
romantic comedies
and wears too much mascara.
The best intervention
you can offer
this man
is not to castrate him
and put him in a dress,
but to expand
his understanding
of gender.
The Stay-At-Home Dad
When I talk
about the importance
of acknowledging
gender differences
and celebrating
gender differences,
some critics assert
that I'm trying
to turn back the clock
to take us back
to the 1950s.
But I'm not.
The challenges today
are different.
We need to help young men
to be better
Stay-At-Home Dads
if that's what works
best for their family.
There's a growing
gender gap
in academic achievement,
as I mentioned
in Chapter 5
and as I document
at length in my book
Boys Adrift.
There's a growing
number of couples
where the woman
earns more than the man.
Childcare
in many regions
of the United States
is exorbitantly expensive,
often more than
the lower-earning
parent can earn.
If that couple
is going to raise children,
it might make more sense
for the young man
to stay at home
and be a full-time parent
rather than working
at a job that might
not even cover
the cost of childcare.
In that case,
that young man
needs to understand
that a stay-at-home parent
must take primary
responsibility
for changing diapers,
vacuuming the floor,
doing the laundry,
preparing the meals,
etc.
We are not doing
a good job
at preparing young men
to be stay-at-home dads.
in part because
many young men
want to be men
and they don't see
role models
in their video games
or their pornography
or their social media
of young men
who are good
stay-at-home dads.
What young men
need today
is going to be different
from what young men
needed in 1955.
There's very little
understanding
that gender matters
today
every bit as much
as it did in 1955,
but that the culture
must respond
differently today
than it did
in that earlier era.
Instead,
the leading universities
try to deconstruct gender
with the result
that many young men
are spending
their free time
playing video games
and looking at porn.
They are adrift
with no guideposts
directing them
to productive manhood.
I have seen firsthand
the results
of neglecting gender
in this way.
Over more than 30 years
as a physician,
I have seen
many marriages end.
If your knowledge
of the world
comes primarily
from TV and movies
and Instagram
and Beyonce,
you might think
that adultery
is the most common
reason why marriages end.
But in my observation,
many couples
are just too busy
for that sort of thing.
Here's a more
common scenario.
A married couple
has two young children,
one still in diapers.
Mom is a bank executive
working 60-plus hours
a week.
Dad is,
at the moment,
out of work,
so he is functioning
as a stay-at-home dad
even though that wasn't
the plan when the couple
married.
But Dad doesn't want
to watch the kids,
so the two children
are at a daycare.
Mom picks the kids
up from daycare
on her way home
from work.
She comes home
to find the house
a mess and supper
not made.
The baby is crying
with a dirty diaper.
Dad is on the couch
watching TV.
Mom is exasperated,
but she doesn't explode.
Not yet.
She says,
Caitlin's diaper
needs to be changed.
You change her diaper
while I make supper.
Dad doesn't know
how to change a diaper,
but something in his wife's
tone of voice
warns him not to protest.
He gets off the couch
and puts the baby
on the changing table.
He starts changing
the diaper,
but gets poop
on the baby's clothes.
Now Mom does explode.
Don't you even know
how to change a diaper?
Can't you do anything?
You're just making
more work for me.
Get out of here.
It doesn't take long
for that mom
to begin wondering
whether she might
be better off,
with less stress
and less shouting,
if she evicted
her unmotivated husband
and hired a nanny instead.
In defense of that dad,
how are you supposed
to know how to change
a diaper if you have
never been instructed?
Nobody is born
knowing how to change
a diaper.
You have to be taught.
Girls learn
from their moms
and from babysitting
or from asking friends
or watching a YouTube video.
Boys are less likely
to have worked
as a babysitter
and perhaps less likely
to watch a YouTube video
about changing diapers,
maybe because they don't think
that's something
that real guys do,
maybe because they don't
recognize that changing
a diaper is serious business
that needs to be
taken seriously.
How can we change that?
How can we improve
the odds that boys
will grow up
knowing how to change
a diaper?
What would an enlightened
approach look like?
An approach that embraced
gender differences
instead of trying
to pretend
that they don't exist.
To understand the answer
and with it a good strategy
for avoiding
the male-female mistake,
it's helpful to consider
what some psychologists
call group contrast effects.
Group contrast effects
mean that when members
of two different groups
are put together,
the members of each group
tend to exaggerate
the differences
between the two groups.
Boys and girls
categorize themselves
as boys and girls
whether or not
it's politically correct
to do so.
When girls are around,
boys are less willing
to exhibit any behavior
that might be considered feminine.
When boys are around,
girls are reluctant
to exhibit behaviors
that might be considered boyish.
Let me give you an example
from one school
that I have visited
on three occasions,
Stonewall Jackson Middle School
in Charleston, West Virginia.
One sixth-grade teacher there
told me how she brought
a rabbit into her
sixth-grade classroom
for one day
just for the children
to see the rabbit close up
as part of the biology unit
on mammals.
As soon as the teacher
brought the rabbit
into the room,
one of the girls said,
Oh, it's so cute!
Can I pet it?
Then one of the boys said,
I'd like to blow its head
off with a bazooka.
From the moment
that boy made that comment,
no other boy in the classroom
showed any interest
in petting the bunny.
The gender lines
had been drawn.
Girls pet bunnies.
Boys blow off
bunnies' heads
with bazookas.
Or at least boys claim
that they want to.
No boy stepped forward
to pet the bunny
despite the teacher's coaxing.
Then the same teacher
was allowed to introduce
single-gender classrooms.
Once again,
she brought in a bunny
to a room of sixth-grade boys,
but this time
there were no girls present.
This time,
about half the boys
wanted to pet the bunny,
which this teacher told me
wasn't much different
from the girls' classroom
where about half the girls
wanted to pet the bunny.
I don't think
that there are large
hardwired differences
between boys and girls
in how much they like
to pet bunnies.
But we live
in a sexist society.
Despite the best efforts
of some professors
to deconstruct gender,
many boys still want
to be seen as men
and many girls
still want to be seen
as women.
Because we provide
so little guidance,
boys today now often
construct masculinity
negatively.
In the absence
of any positive guidance,
being a real man
comes to mean
not doing whatever
girls want to do.
If girls want
to pet bunnies,
then I don't want to.
If girls are careful
not to take crazy
physical risks,
then I will skate
my skateboard
off the high ledge
onto the concrete
pavement below
with everybody watching.
If girls care about
turning in the homework
on time,
then I will make a point
of playing video games
instead of doing
the homework.
How to apply
this understanding
to the problem
of getting boys
to learn
to change diapers
and to master
other tasks
that stay-at-home dads
need to know?
If you offer
an optional
after-school class
on babysitting,
including a segment
on learning
to change diapers,
you won't get
many boys to sign up.
Most boys regard
babysitting
and changing diapers
as things girls do.
Group contrast effects
kick in.
Most boys won't sign up
even if they would like to.
Few boys want to be
the only boy
in a babysitting class
with 12 girls.
I learned a better approach
when I visited
University School,
a boys' private school
in northeastern Ohio.
They told me
about their
all-boys
babysitting elective,
which was very popular
with the boys,
including the jocks.
They teach the boys
that changing a diaper
is a high-stakes game
with three objectives.
One,
don't allow the baby
to fall onto the floor.
Two,
don't get any poop
on the baby's penis
or vagina
because of the risk
of urinary tract infection.
Three,
don't get any poop
on the baby's clothes.
The class is taught
by real parents,
first using life-size dolls,
then using real babies.
There is a picture
of this in the PDF
that accompanies
this audiobook.
The boys love it.
The truth is,
it can be great fun
to play with a baby,
to feed a baby,
to teach a baby.
Boys can enjoy it
just as much
as girls enjoy it.
But the best way
to engage boys
in that activity
is different
from the best way
to engage girls
in that activity.
If you don't understand that,
if you pretend
that gender doesn't matter,
you end up with boys
who think changing diapers
is for girls,
and the result
is fathers
who don't know
how to change a diaper.
The same principle
applies with regard
to helping girls
to break through
gender stereotypes.
As I mentioned
in Chapter 5,
the most effective strategies
to motivate girls
in computer coding
are different
from the most effective
strategies for boys.
In an all-girls
computer coding class,
you can deploy
those strategies
free from group
contrast effects.
In the United States,
boys taking AP
computer science
now outnumber girls
by more than
three to one,
as we discussed
in Chapter 5.
If there are
three girls in a class
with eleven boys,
those three girls
may feel like
they don't belong,
and no amount
of preaching
about gender equity
is going to change that.
But if the class
is just girls,
you may get more girls
to sign up,
and the girls
will be more comfortable
and will likely
gain more confidence.
There are a number
of programs
already in existence
that embody
these simple truths,
programs like
Girls Who Code.
The late Dr. Sally Ride
devoted much
of her professional life
to creating
Sally Ride Science Camps,
all-girls science camps,
because Dr. Ride,
the first American woman
to fly in space,
understood this concept.
But programs like these
are too few
and too far between.
I am not here
making a general case
for single-sex education
in all content areas.
I am making the point
that in view of
what we know
about group contrast effects
and the confusion
about gender
in contemporary
American society,
if you want to engage
girls and boys
specifically in areas
that the contemporary culture
deems gender-atypical,
babysitting for boys
or computer science
for girls,
then you would do well
to consider offering
those programs
in gender-specific formats,
such as an
all-boys babysitting class
or an all-girls
computer coding class,
teaching those topics
using gender-aware strategies.
If you want to break down
gender stereotypes,
you have to begin
by understanding
gender differences
and working with
those differences
rather than ignoring them
or pretending
they don't exist.
Preventing Sexual Assault
and Sexual Harassment
I began this chapter
with the story
of two high school boys
who were convicted
of raping a girl
who was drunk
and unconscious.
How best to prevent
sexual assault
and sexual harassment?
At most middle schools,
high schools,
and universities,
students hear a series
of secular sermons
about treating everybody
with respect
coupled with warnings
about the terrible consequences
for those who don't
obey the rules,
often with details
about the difficulty
of getting into
a good school
or finding a good job
once you have been convicted
of a sex crime.
In my observations
at more than 400 schools,
the most common outcome
of such harping
is a growing proportion
of teenage boys
who stay in their bedrooms
masturbating over pornography.
Many boys have told me
that the instructor
in their high school
sex ed class
openly encouraged them
to choose masturbation
over actual sexual encounters,
explaining that
when you masturbate,
you don't have to worry
about affirmative consent.
There's a better way.
In my observation,
the schools that are
most effective
in preventing sexual assault
and sexual harassment,
without scaring boys
away from sexual intimacy
altogether,
are those schools
that teach girls and boys
to be ladies and gentlemen.
A gentleman does not
harass a lady,
and a lady will not
tolerate harassment.
How, then,
to teach boys
to be gentlemen?
Or, more precisely,
how to inspire boys
to want to behave
like gentlemen
in a culture
that celebrates
disrespect,
semi-nude selfies,
and pornography?
I delivered
the commencement address
at Avon Old Farms,
a boys' school
in Connecticut.
I noticed
that there were
many teenage girls
in the audience,
far outnumbering
the boys.
You guys all seem
to have about
four sisters apiece,
I said to some
of the boys.
Those aren't
our sisters,
Dr. Sachs,
one of the boys
told me.
Those are friends.
You mean girlfriends?
Some of them
are girlfriends.
Most of them
are just friends,
he said.
This piqued my interest.
I spoke with
some of the girls.
A few were from
Miss Porter's school,
a girls' school
about five miles away,
but most were
from Westminster,
a nearby co-ed school.
A co-ed school?
I said.
So,
what are you girls
doing here?
Why would you
want to hang out here
at a boys' school
when you have boys
at your own school?
One girl rolled
her eyes.
The boys at our school
are all such
total losers,
she said.
Being around them
is like being
around my younger brother.
They're loud
and obnoxious
and annoying,
and they think
they're so tough.
It's nauseating.
The other girls laughed
and nodded
their agreement.
And the boys here
are really that different?
I asked.
They all nodded again.
Totally,
another girl said.
The boys here
are like gentlemen.
I know that sounds
really weird
and old-fashioned,
but that's just
the way it is.
Like they stand up
when you come
in the room.
They open doors
for you.
And they don't
interrupt you,
another girl said,
interrupting.
I hate trying
to talk to guys
at our school
because they are
always interrupting.
You should come here
some weekend,
Dr. Sachs,
another girl said.
You would totally
not even know
that this is
a boys' school.
There are probably
more girls here
than boys
on the weekend.
We just totally
mobbed the place.
Not even to hang out
with the guys necessarily.
Last week,
a bunch of us girls
went down to the
indoor hockey rink
here at the school
just to slide around
on the ice.
Just us girls.
But why bother
to come to this school
at all?
You could have just
gone to a public
ice skating rink,
I said.
She shook her head,
no.
It wouldn't be the same.
It's fun to hang out here
because it's like
we're family,
another girl said.
Because it feels safe,
another girl said.
This school is not unique.
I have heard
similar comments
from other girls
who like to congregate
at boys' schools,
for example,
at Georgetown Prep
in Bethesda, Maryland.
I hasten to add
that I have heard
very different comments
at other boys' schools.
I have heard girls say
that they would never,
ever in a million years
hang out
at certain boys' schools.
Just establishing
a boys' school
doesn't make that school
a place where girls
like to gather.
On the contrary,
when you put teenage boys
together in groups
without the right kind
of adult leadership,
they can easily become
a gang of bullies
and thugs
who consider sexual assault
an amusing pastime.
Leadership from
responsible adults
makes the difference
between schools
where girls feel safe
and welcome
and schools
where girls feel unsafe
because they are unsafe.
schools like the one
in Connecticut
where I spoke
don't leave this
to chance.
They make a point
of teaching boys
to be gentlemen.
At this particular school,
the boys are taught
the school's
eight core values
which are
scholarship,
integrity,
civility,
tolerance,
altruism,
sportsmanship,
responsibility,
self-discipline.
It's not enough
for a boy
to become a man.
We want him
to become a gentleman,
the headmaster,
Kenneth LaRocque,
explained to me.
At this school,
LaRocque and his colleagues
explicitly teach
the rules
that they believe
define a gentleman.
A gentleman
doesn't make
pretend farting noises
to amuse his buddies.
A gentleman
doesn't harass
girls or women.
A gentleman
doesn't interrupt
a girl
when she is speaking.
A gentleman
defends a weak
or unpopular person
against a bully.
A gentleman
stands up
when a girl
or woman
enters the room.
At this school,
all these points
are explicitly
taught to the boys.
You can't assume
that boys today
know these things.
Many of them don't,
but they can be taught,
Mr. LaRocque said.
A boy does not
naturally grow up
to be a gentleman.
You need a community
of men
showing boys
how to behave,
and that's what
we provide here.
I'm not suggesting
that Mr. LaRocque
is the guru.
I'm not suggesting
that he has
all the answers.
But he has
an answer.
He and his colleagues
have developed
one particular way
of teaching boys
to become gentlemen.
There are other
core values
you might choose
and other ways
of teaching
those values.
Heather Haupt,
mother of three boys,
sent me a draft
of her book
Knights in Training,
Ten Principles
for Raising Honorable,
Courageous,
and Compassionate Boys.
Her principles include,
among others,
protect the weak,
respect women,
and speak the truth.
I don't necessarily agree
with all ten
of her principles,
and not all of her principles
are gender-specific.
All children,
both girls and boys,
should be taught
to speak the truth.
But Haupt includes
a lengthy section
explaining why
respecting women
means that a gentleman
does not look at pornography.
That's something
boys need to be taught.
It's less important
to teach that to girls
because girls
are less likely
than boys
to want to spend
hours a day
looking at pornography.
Re-listen to Chapter 6
if you're unsure
of that finding.
For the girls' side
of this story,
I recommend
Girls Gone Mild,
Young Women,
Reclaim Self-Respect,
and Find It's Not Bad
to Be Good,
by Wendy Shallott,
and Strong Fathers,
Strong Daughters
by my friend
Dr. Meg Meeker.
Almost every culture
of which we have
detailed knowledge
takes great care
in guiding girls
and boys
through the transition
to womanhood
and manhood,
respectively.
One example,
the Kung Bushmen
of Southwest Africa
who call themselves
the Harmless People.
Their culture
is non-violent.
War is unknown.
They have no warriors
and no tradition
of combat.
Yet, even here,
according to
anthropologist
David Gilmore,
in a culture
that treasures
gentleness
and cooperation
above all things,
the boys must earn
the right to be called
men by a test
of skill
and endurance.
They must single-handedly
track and kill
a sizable adult antelope,
an act that requires
courage and hardiness.
Only after their
first kill
of such a buck
are they considered
fully men
and permitted
to marry.
Professor Gilmore
devoted several years
to researching
the transition
to manhood
in cultures
around the world,
including the Kung.
There are many societies
where aggressive hunting
never played
an important role,
Gilmore writes,
where men do not bond
for economic purposes,
where violence
and war
are devalued
or unknown,
and yet,
where men are
even today
concerned about
demonstrating manhood.
What happens
when a culture
like ours
neglects this transition,
pretending that
what boys need
to become good men
is no different
from what girls
need to become
good women?
For a decade or two
or three,
perhaps,
the culture
can coast along.
But after a generation,
after thirty-plus years
of neglecting
this transition,
problems begin
to develop.
If we fail
to provide boys
with pro-social models
of the transition
to adulthood,
they will look
to same-age peers
and construct their own
which may not be
positive and constructive.
A hero
or a criminal?
A truly insightful
evidence-based approach
to gender
would mean
understanding
the differences
between girls
and boys
and working
to make sure
that differences
don't become
disadvantages.
We know
that human females,
like females
in other primate species,
are less likely
than males
to take risks.
See Chapter 3.
So,
work with girls
to empower them
to take risks.
Learn from programs
like the one
at St. Michael's
Collegiate School
in Tasmania,
which I shared
in Chapter 3,
which culminates
in girls
happily and confidently
rappelling down
a sheer cliff
over the Pacific Ocean
at Freycinet.
We know
that human males,
like males
in other primate species,
are more likely
than females
to engage
in risky
and aggressive
activities.
See Chapters 3
and 4.
So,
work with boys
to channel
their aggression
into constructive
behavior.
Let me tell you
a story
that illustrates
what I mean.
Thunder Bay
is a small town
on the north shore
of Lake Superior.
A teenage boy
there,
let's call him
David,
fell in with
a bad group
of kids,
a gang.
To earn membership
in the gang,
a boy had to
commit a crime.
So,
David broke
into an old woman's
house while she
was out shopping
and stole
some of her jewelry.
David then sold
the jewelry
at a local pawn shop.
When the woman
reported the crime
to police,
it didn't take
the detective long
to track the stolen
goods back to David.
David was promptly
arrested and convicted.
He was sent
to juvenile detention.
The warden
of the facility
had a friend
who owned
a lumber yard.
The friend
mentioned to the
warden that he
had a pile of lumber
that was warped
and could not be sold
for construction purposes,
although it would
make good firewood.
The warden also knew
of a non-profit group
that helped the elderly.
The head of the
non-profit had mentioned
to him that some
of the elderly
in Thunder Bay
still heated
their homes with wood,
but firewood
was expensive,
so the homes
of some of these
elderly people
were colder
than they ought to be.
The warden
asked his friend
at the lumber yard
whether he would
be willing to
cut up and donate
the warped lumber
for free,
and he said
that he would.
Now all that
was needed
was some way
to deliver the wood
to the homes
of the elderly
who needed it.
The warden
asked for volunteers
to help.
Three teenage boys
volunteered,
including David.
It was a bitterly
cold and windy day
in mid-December,
if you have
spent some time
on the north shore
of Lake Superior,
you know what
I'm talking about.
In a small town
like Thunder Bay,
the warden
does a lot of
chores himself,
so the warden
himself was driving
the pickup truck
to deliver the wood,
and the three boys
were with him.
They had made
just two deliveries
when the warden
said,
Hey, guys,
it's way too cold
today.
This is ridiculous.
The wind's gusting.
It's freezing.
If we stay out here,
we're all gonna die.
Let's head back
and get inside.
We can try to finish
some other day
when it's not
so crazy cold.
But David said,
No way!
We still have
deliveries to make.
Those old folks
are expecting us
today.
We can't let them down.
The warden
was impressed
by David's passion,
and so they
continued on.
The next house
on the list
turned out to be
the very same home
that David
had broken into.
So there was David,
stacking wood
in freezing cold
and gusty wind
for the same woman
whose home
he had broken into
a few months before.
Boys want to be men.
If we can channel
that heroic,
aggressive,
risk-taking drive
in a good way,
the result may be
a boy gallantly
stacking wood
for an old woman
on a winter's day.
If we fail
to channel that drive,
if we pretend
that gender
doesn't matter,
the result is a boy
breaking into
an old woman's house
to prove to himself
and to his peers
that he's a real man.
Beyond Pink and Blue
Back in 2003,
a group of distinguished
scholars convened
at Dartmouth Medical School
to discuss,
among other topics,
how our society's
neglect of gender
differences
has caused
great harm.
Adults need to get
serious about
the question of gender,
the scholars concluded.
The need to attach
social significance
and meaning
to gender
appears to be
a human universal,
they wrote,
and one that
deeply influences
well-being.
These researchers
acknowledged that
many people view
gender not as
an innate
biological characteristic,
but as a socially
constructed role.
After reviewing
the evidence,
these experts
concluded that
such a perspective
is seriously
incomplete.
Gender runs
deeper,
near to the core
of human identity
and social meaning,
in part because
it is biologically
primed and connected
to differences
in brain structure
and function,
and in part because
it is so deeply
implicated in the
transition to adulthood.
The transition
to adulthood
More than in
any other realm,
that's where our
society now lets
kids down.
We offer our
daughters and sons
little guidance
about what it
means to become
a woman or a man.
In traditional
societies,
the transition
to a gendered
adulthood is a
matter of great
importance,
observed with
ceremonies and
rituals that are
markedly different
for girls and
boys, so the
scholars convened
at Dartmouth
observed.
Female rites of
passage tend to
celebrate entry
into womanhood.
For young women,
many world rituals
suggest that with
monarchy comes
heightened introspective
powers, greater
spiritual access, and
an enriched inner
life.
Male rites of
passage are often
more punishing,
typically involving
suffering and
endurance.
Such rituals seek
to help the boy
connect with
spiritual and
mythic meaning and
totemic sponsorship,
from which he will
draw strength to
control his own
aggression and to
direct it toward the
prosocial goals of
his community.
One hundred years
from now, scholars
may look back at
the cultural
disintegration manifest
in the first half
of the twenty-first
century and
conclude that a
fundamental cause for
the unraveling of
our social fabric was
the neglect of gender
and the raising of
our children.
I wonder what those
future historians will
say about how long it
took us to recognize
our mistake, to
realize that what
girls need is
different from what
boys need, to
understand that
gender matters.
I hope that the
blinders are coming
off at last.
In 2017, the
Journal of Neuroscience
Research devoted an
entire issue to sex
differences in every
aspect of brain
function, from vision
to learning to mental
illness.
The issue was
791 pages long,
with 73 different
scholarly articles.
Larry Cahill, a
professor of
neuroscience at the
University of California
at Irvine, who served
as editor for the
special edition, wrote,
Due to a deeply
ingrained, implicit,
but false assumption
that equal means the
same, most
neuroscientists knew
and even feared that
establishing that males
and females are not
the same in some
aspect of brain
function meant
establishing that
they were not equal.
This assumption is
false and deeply
harmful, in
particular to the
health of women, but
remains deeply
impactful nonetheless.
The past 15 to 20
years in particular
witnessed an explosion
of research, despite
the prevailing biases
against the topic,
documenting sex
influences at all
levels of brain
function.
So overpowering is
the wave of research
that the standard ways
of dismissing sex
influences, for
example, they are all
small and unreliable,
they are all due to
circulating hormones,
they are all due to
human culture, and
they don't exist on the
molecular level, have
all been swept away, at
least for those
cognizant of the
research.
The 73 papers in
this volume forcefully
document the fact that
sex influences on
brain function are
ubiquitous, regularly
reshaping findings,
hence conclusions, at
all levels of our
field and powerfully
demonstrating how much
sex matters.
The notion that sex
matters fundamentally,
powerfully, and
pervasively for all of
neuroscience, not just
for reproduction, is an
idea whose time indeed
has come.
So perhaps the
neuroscientists, or at
least some of them, are
finding the courage to
allow reality rather than
ideology to guide their
research.
You and I are not
neuroscientists.
We have an even bigger
job.
Our job now is to
create a society that
has the courage and
the wisdom to cherish
and celebrate the innate
differences between the
sexes, while at the
same time enabling equal
opportunities for every
child.
Gender is central to the
human experience.
But as in every other
domain, girls and boys
need guidance from
grown-ups if they are to
grow up to be the women
and men they were meant
to be.
Help your daughter to
become a confident and
authentic woman, a lady.
Help your son to become a
courteous and respectful
man, a gentleman.
That won't be easy.
It never has been.
And contemporary culture,
with the determined
blindness to gender shown
by the elites, coupled with
the stereotyped caricatures of
tough dudes and sexy girls
pervasive on social media,
makes the parents' job today
that much harder.
I don't claim to have all
the answers, but I think
I'm asking the right
questions.
We live in an era with new
challenges.
The answer is not a
problem.
I don't claim to have all the
answers, but I think I'm
asking the right questions.
