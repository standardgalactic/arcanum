woman instructing a young girl in the use of a telescope. The implicit message of that picture
for a young woman of the time was, you belong here. Physics is an appropriate subject for you
to study. Contrast that picture with a typical photograph in a 21st century physics textbook.
In the PDF that accompanies this audiobook, there is a detailed picture of an apple right after a
bullet has been shot through it. I have seen the photo in a number of contemporary physics
textbooks. If you show that photo to boys, the reaction is typically positive. Way cool. That
looks like fun. Can we do that? Shoot a rifle at an apple? I showed this same photo to girls at
Branksome Hall, a girls' school in Toronto. One of the girls raised her hand and asked,
who had to clean up that mess? Girls are less likely than boys to be excited at the prospect
of firing a weapon at a defenseless fruit. There is more than one way to present the content.
Earlier in this chapter, we considered various approaches to teaching Fibonacci numbers.
Educational researchers Anat Zohar and David Sella found that the same is true of physics.
Talking about bombs and bullets and collisions is a good way to teach physics to most boys.
And that's the way it's often taught. A quarterback is stationary. He is looking for a receiver.
A cornerback blitzing from the blind side has a mass of 80 kilograms and is running at a speed of
8 meters per second. Assuming that the quarterback has a mass of 90 kilograms and that the collision
is perfectly inelastic with an incident angle of 30 degrees, calculate the motion of the cornerback
and the quarterback immediately after the collision. That sort of question engages many boys.
But it's less likely to be effective with girls, and not just because it's football. You can try the
same thing with train cars colliding and the girls will still be less excited than the boys on average.
Zohar and Sella found that simply plugging numbers into formulas was unsatisfying for most of the
girls in the AP physics classes they surveyed. The girls were more interested in knowing why.
As one girl asked, why is the gravitational force between two objects inversely proportional to the
square of the distance between them? Why isn't it inversely proportional to the cube or the fourth power?
As it happens, we do have a set of introductory physics textbooks that focus on the why,
written by the late Nobel laureate Richard Feynman. It's not watered down, it's rigorous and computational.
But it's girl-friendly physics because it always comes back to the question of why.
Jen Alabaster told me she always has a copy of the Feynman Lectures on Physics close at hand
to share with a girl who wants to dig deeper into the question of why.
The great mission of education is to enable every child to fulfill their potential.
But what a girl needs to achieve is often different from what a boy needs to achieve.
Thirty years of gender-blind education have not ameliorated gender differences in important educational outcomes.
In some cases, gender-blind education has exacerbated gender stereotypes by biasing prevailing teaching methods
for a subject to appeal to one gender. Ignoring gender differences disadvantages both girls and boys.
Tina and Jimmy
Tina Jimenez faced a potential triple whammy when she started ninth grade.
Ninth grade at a new school isn't easy for anybody.
Everybody's trying to figure out who's who and who's cool.
Where do I fit in?
But in addition to the challenge of a new school, Tina had the additional burden of having just moved to the area,
not knowing anybody, and also of belonging to a minority group with almost no representation at her new school.
Her family had just moved to suburban Maryland from Miami, Florida.
Both her parents had immigrated to the United States in the 1970s from the Dominican Republic.
Being a dark-skinned Hispanic girl at Seneca Valley High, which is overwhelmingly white, might have been a major problem for some girls.
But Tina made friends easily.
Three weeks into the new school year, she was off to a good start.
Her soccer teammates were impressed by her fearlessness on the field.
She was a skillful player, but she didn't make a big deal about it.
The other girls on the team soon were including her in everything they did, adopting her as one of their own.
She and most of the other soccer girls were invited to a party the last Saturday in September at a large house in the upscale section of Germantown.
Tina stayed close to her friend and soccer buddy Jennifer, a tenth grader.
After they had been at the party for half an hour, Tina noticed an older boy staring at her.
Who's that? she asked Jennifer.
Who's what? Jennifer shouted over the music.
That blonde guy over there wearing the Redskins sweatshirt, Tina said.
Ooh, that's Jimmy.
Jimmy Mandeville, senior, football player.
Not so great as a football player, but in other departments he's supposed to be a monster, Jennifer winked.
Tina rolled her eyes and shook her head.
I'm totally not interested, she said.
Jimmy came over to them, his eyes fixed on Tina.
Hi, he said.
His breath smelled of beer, which was not surprising as he was holding an open Budweiser can.
Hi, both girls said.
Jimmy looked Tina up and down, his glassy eyes lingering on her chest.
He was nodding his head in time to the beat of the music.
Want to hook up? he asked Tina, point blank.
Tina's eyes went wide.
Hey, Jennifer!
Another boy appeared out of nowhere and grabbed Jennifer by the arm.
You gotta see this, come on!
Jennifer gave Tina a sad look as if to say, sorry to leave you all by yourself, and Jennifer was gone.
Please don't leave me, Jennifer, Tina thought.
Her heart sank.
Jimmy towered over her.
The way he was nodding his head in time with the music began to irritate her,
and she was worried that he might spill some of his beer on her blouse.
Want to hook up? he said again, more a statement than a question.
What do you mean? she asked, stalling for time.
She knew what he meant, but she didn't know how to say no without offending him or sounding lame.
And as a freshman talking to a popular senior, she didn't have the confidence to just turn her back and walk away.
He snorted in amazement, then burped.
Freshman girl! Come on, I'll show you!
He grabbed her by the arm, tossed the half-empty beer can onto the carpet,
and pulled her into a small study lit only by a tabletop lamp on a desk.
Tina saw another couple already in a corner of the room, fondling each other.
Before she could say anything, Jimmy pulled her down to the floor beside the desk.
Jimmy groped at her breasts with one hand while he fumbled with the snap on her pants with his other.
Tina's mind was in a whirl.
This is crazy, how can this be happening?
She wanted to push him off, to scream.
But what would happen next?
The other kids would laugh at her.
Freshman girl! Prude! Dork!
Come on, Jimmy said.
What's your problem?
I... I don't know how, Tina said.
Seriously?
I'll show you, Jimmy said.
Come on, he snapped, standing up and pulling her to a kneeling position, facing him.
He unzipped his fly.
Tina had never given a boy oral sex before.
She had heard other girls talk about it, of course, but the idea repulsed her.
Why would any girl want to have a boy's you-know-what in her mouth?
Yuck!
Now a total stranger.
A boy she had never met.
A boy she wasn't even attracted to.
Three minutes later, it was over.
Sweet.
A little clumsy on your end, but sweet, Jimmy said.
With a little more experience, you could be dynamite, sister.
See you later.
Zipping up his fly, he left the room without looking back.
I couldn't see.
Did you spit or swallow?
The question came from a skinny boy Tina had never seen before, who had apparently been
watching from across the room.
He giggled.
Tina thought she would vomit.
Hooking up.
Girls and boys face very different challenges when it comes to sex.
Most young women enjoy physical intimacy more when it develops in the context of a loving
relationship.
Few women or girls really understand how different sex is for many men and for most boys.
And the type of intimacy most common among teenagers today, hooking up, feeds into the worst
kind of male sexuality.
Hooking up, in case you didn't know, means being physically intimate with the understanding
that no romantic relationship is implied and none is expected.
It's sex without love.
Sex without the bother of a relationship.
I can't tell you how many girls come in who are bereft about having had sex too soon,
says New York psychologist Marsha Levy Warren.
She's seeing more and more teen and preteen girls whose emotional lives are in turmoil after
some kind of sexual encounter.
They went to a party, they hooked up and did what they assumed everyone was doing.
Then they feel awful.
Teachers and counselors are hearing about more and more sexual activity of a detached,
unemotional kind among preteens and young teens.
I call it body parts sex, says Dr. Levy Warren.
The kids don't even look at each other.
It's mechanical, dehumanizing.
The fallout is that later in life they have trouble forming relationships.
They're jaded.
Oral sex is definitely a trend, says Professor Peter Leon of the University of North Carolina
at Chapel Hill.
And it's happening in public because teenagers don't see it as a big deal.
In some places, oral sex is taken so lightly that it's treated like a racy version of truth
or dare or spin the bottle.
A girl who did it for her boyfriend on a school bus was upset when she found a line of guys
in school the next week wanting her to go down on them, says Tamara Kreinen, president of the
Sexuality Information and Education Council.
Another girl went down on a bunch of guys at a party and then the next week in sex ed, the
other kids said, Amy was going down on guys at this party.
She should teach the class.
The girl wasn't ready for that.
I've had lots of kids tell me that they got this sick feeling in their stomachs the next
day.
Here's what one 16-year-old girl told me.
I was in a hookup with this guy, Zachary.
I tried to kiss him and he wouldn't let me.
That was weird.
I mean, we were doing stuff way beyond kissing, but he didn't want to kiss.
I asked him why he didn't want to kiss me and he was like, I don't kiss girls on the
mouth because if I'm not in a relationship, why should I kiss?
Several boys have told me, in words similar to Zachary's, that they deliberately avoid
kissing a girl when they're hooking up.
These boys really believe that they're being virtuous in a weird 21st century way by not
kissing the girl they're hooking up with.
These boys believe that kissing a girl on the lips sends the message, I'm interested in
having a romantic relationship with you.
They don't want to send that message.
By keeping face-to-face interactions out of the encounter, by restricting their intimacy
to oral sex or a groping quick feel, these boys believe that they are at least being honest
about their intentions, which are purely physical.
Another girl said, I know it was just a hookup, but it felt so right I was sure he would call.
I just couldn't believe it when he never called.
Then, two weeks later, after I hadn't heard from him at all, I saw him at a party and he
wanted to hook up again.
It made me feel dirty, like he just wanted to, like, use me, use my body.
Like I wasn't really even there.
Like he was just jerking off using me instead of looking at porn.
In Chapter 10, we will turn our attention to lesbian, gay, and bisexual individuals.
Our focus in this chapter is on straight, a.k.a. heterosexual girls and boys.
But when I do presentations on the topic of girl-boy differences in sex and sexual motivation,
somebody always raises their hand at this point with a question which is some variation on,
this may be true for straight kids, but what about lesbian and gay kids?
The short answer is that gay boys are boys and lesbian girls are girls.
Young gay men, just like young straight men, are often interested in sex for the sake of sex
and not necessarily as part of a romantic relationship.
Young lesbian women, just like young straight women, are more likely to say that sex is more
fulfilling in the context of a romantic relationship.
Girl-boy differences are more profound and more fundamental than sexual orientation.
I will flesh out this point at greater length in Chapter 10.
Choosing virginity?
The Centers for Disease Control has reported that the number of teenagers age 15 to 19 who have had sexual intercourse
decreased significantly between 1988 and 2010.
The decrease was especially striking for boys.
In 1988, 60% of never-married young men 15 to 19 years old reported that they had had sexual intercourse.
By 2010, that figure had dropped to just 42%.
What happened?
Are more boys saving themselves for marriage?
Have they discovered religion?
In this chapter, sexual intercourse means penile-vaginal intercourse.
When I mean oral sex, I will say oral sex.
Let's take a closer look at the CDC study.
CDC investigators interviewed a demographically representative sample of 4,662 teens from across the country
asking each teen in a structured one-on-one interview whether she or he had ever had intercourse.
Then, the researchers compared those results with results from previous studies.
In 1988, 51% of never-married young women 15 to 19 years of age reported that they had had intercourse at least once.
By 2010, that was down to 43%.
As noted, the decline for young men was even steeper, from 60% to 42%.
What happened?
And why was the reduction among boys, a reduction of 18% from 60% to 42%,
more than double the girls' decrease of 8% from 51% to 43%?
As I have mentioned previously, I have visited more than 400 schools over the past 16 years.
I have talked with kids in cities, in suburbs, and in rural areas.
I can think of two reasons why fewer teens are having sexual intercourse compared with 30 years ago.
The first reason is that oral sex is displacing old-fashioned penile-vaginal intercourse.
The CDC report concerned only penile-vaginal intercourse.
The CDC interviewers did not mention oral sex except to make sure that each teen understood
that the interviewer was asking about vaginal intercourse, not oral sex.
Among sexually active teenagers in the 1980s and 1990s,
vaginal intercourse was far more common than oral sex.
Today, oral sex is much more widespread than it was 20 or 30 years ago.
Oral sex is the new second base, says Alexandra Hall,
a journalist who spent weeks interviewing students at suburban high schools in the Boston area.
Things are very, very different in high school from the way they used to be.
There has been a profound shift in the culture of high school dating and sex
with no strings hooking up replacing dating.
Kids don't date nowadays, agrees physician and bioethicist Leon Kass.
Traditional dating is dead, concurs journalist and author Barbara Defoe Whitehead.
In the 1980s, teenage sexual intimacy had a different context.
That context was called dating, says journalist Hall.
These days, something else is much more common.
Single boys and girls go in a group to a friend's house,
where the parents may or may not be home,
drink or smoke pot, then pair off and engage in no-strings hookups.
A week later, when the same scenario happens again,
they hook up with someone else.
Michael Milburn, a professor at the University of Massachusetts,
concurs that
The days of a boy showing up at a girl's front door and meeting her parents
before he takes her on a date are almost obsolete.
Dating has been replaced by house parties and a culture of hooking up.
I agree with Professor Milburn.
The scenario of the boy meeting the girl's parents before taking the girl out on a date
is indeed obsolete, along with the rotary dial telephone.
Whether it ought to be obsolete is a different question.
Nobody disputes that the modern cordless house phone
is a significant improvement over the old rotary dial telephone.
But the shift from the culture of dating to the culture of the hookup
signifies a shift from romance to impersonal sex.
That shift is not a cause for celebration,
even if it has been associated with a decrease in the rates of penile-vaginal intercourse
and a corresponding decline in the rate of teenage pregnancy.
So, one big reason behind the decrease in vaginal intercourse
is the greater prevalence of oral sex.
A second major factor is the normalization of pornography
and the growing tendency of some boys to prefer masturbation
over actual sexual encounters with actual girls.
Refer to my comments later in this chapter about John Mayer.
Listening to teenage girls and boys,
it seems that more and more of their experience is lived online or via a screen.
If your top priority in life is getting 10,000 followers on Instagram
or being the first in your group to finish all the missions in Grand Theft Auto
or some other video game,
then vaginal intercourse might take a back seat.
No pun intended.
For many teenage boys, sex is an object in itself.
The challenge for a teenage boy is to integrate the desires of the soul and spirit
with the needs of the body,
to weld his sexual drive to his desire for friendship and companionship.
For many teenage boys, and for some adult men,
that doesn't come easily.
Some never reach that level of maturity.
But there are some things a parent can do to help.
First, though, we need to look more closely at basic differences
between the sexuality of girls and women
and the sexuality of boys and men.
Oxytocin is not testosterone.
What's the relation between love and sex?
The neurochemical basis for both love and sex in females
involves the hormone oxytocin,
the same hormone released when a mother breastfeeds her newborn baby.
Oxytocin's effects on both romantic attachment and sexual behavior
are estrogen-dependent and gender-specific,
observes neuropsychologist Lisa Diamond,
adding that there appear to be
more extensive oxytocin circuits in female than male brains.
In males, on the other hand,
the hormone underlying sexual drive is not oxytocin,
but testosterone,
the same hormone that mediates aggression in males.
Many researchers have used functional MRI
to look at brain activity in women and men during sexual arousal.
One consistent finding is that men show comparatively more activity
in the older, more primitive areas of the brain,
such as the amygdala, thalamus, and hypothalamus,
while women show proportionately more activity
up in the cerebral cortex.
That's true even when the women report
feeling more sexually aroused than the men.
And these sex differences are apparently
not affected by sexual orientation.
Reviewers found no significant differences
in the patterns of brain activity of straight men
compared with gay men,
but large differences between men and women,
regardless of sexual orientation.
These sex differences suggest
that women's sexual experience
is happening more in the cerebral cortex
and is therefore more connected
with the rest of what's going on in their mind.
The sexual experience in men
is less connected with the cortex,
less connected with the outside world.
One recent study actually showed
that in young men,
sexual arousal decreases functional synchronization
between cortical areas of the brain.
That's a fancy way of saying
that when a young man is sexually aroused,
his brain literally comes unglued
and the different parts
aren't talking with one another.
The weight of the evidence strongly suggests
that males and females
experience sexual desire differently.
As UCLA psychologist Ann Peplow observes,
women's sexuality tends to be strongly linked
to a close relationship.
For women,
an important goal of sex is intimacy.
The best context for pleasurable sex
is a committed relationship.
This is less true for men.
You can say that again.
For many boys and for some men,
especially younger men,
the sexual urge is closely tied to aggression.
That's not surprising when you remember
that in males,
both the sexual urge and the aggressive urge
are mediated by testosterone.
In one carefully designed study,
a surprisingly high percentage,
35% of normal college men,
said that they not only fantasized about rape,
but would actually rape a woman
if they had the chance
and they were sure they wouldn't be caught.
In another study of normal college men,
more than half said
they would actually rape a woman
if they were assured of not being punished.
Researchers have found
that more than 80%
of popular porn videos
include some form
of degrading violence against women.
Most often,
the woman is slapped
or gagged
or spanked
or has her hair yanked.
But the men who watch these videos
are not necessarily Neanderthals.
In fact,
researchers have found
no association
between a man's gender role beliefs
and the likelihood
that he finds rape sexually appealing.
Some men
who are strongly in favor
of equal rights for women
who approve of women
in leadership roles
and so on
also say
that they would rape a woman
if they had the opportunity.
In one recent study,
men who watched pornography
were actually
somewhat more likely
to endorse equal rights
for women
compared with men
who don't look at porn.
Nor is there any association,
positive or negative,
between a man's intelligence
and the likelihood
that he will be sexually aroused
by depictions of rape.
Highly intelligent men
are no less likely
to fantasize about raping a woman
than are men
of below average intelligence.
Men and women
experience sexuality differently.
A significant number of men
may feel tempted
to engage in sexual assault
even if they are otherwise intelligent
and believe in equal rights
for women.
Women are much less likely
to feel a strong temptation
to engage in sexual assault.
These differences
between women and men
can be traced
at least in part
to biological causes,
including the differences
between testosterone
and oxytocin.
A sensible,
common-sense approach
to preventing sexual assault
would begin by recognizing
these hardwired differences.
In Chapter 12,
I share what such an approach
looks like.
Young men
are much more likely
than young women
to find pornography
satisfying and fulfilling.
Few young women
would use the word
fulfilling
to describe the experience
of masturbating
over pornography.
But pornography
has gone mainstream.
The pop star John Mayer
proudly told
Rolling Stone magazine
that he is
the new generation
of masturbator.
He would rather
masturbate over pornography
than have sex
with actual women.
I haven't heard
of any leading
female celebrities
who have boasted
that they would rather
masturbate over pornography
than have sex
with real people.
The motivation
for sex
is different
for most teenage boys
than for most teenage girls.
Many teenage boys
want to have sex
to satisfy sexual desire.
It's a gut-level,
base-of-the-brain impulse
not far removed
from the need
to have a bowel movement
when you feel the urge.
Many boys will tell you
that the urge feels
just that irresistible.
Not so for most girls.
As psychologist
Roy Baumeister
has observed,
male desire
aims at the sexual
activity itself,
whereas female desire
aims beyond it
toward other outcomes
and consequences.
Professor Joan Jacobs Brumberg,
who has written
two books
about the psychosexual
development
of teenage girls,
agrees.
Sexual pleasure
is usually not
the motivating factor
when teenage girls
engage in sex,
Brumberg finds.
That's especially true
for oral sex.
Girls today
provide far more
oral sex for boys
than did girls
in previous generations,
but Brumberg says
that they do so
without pleasure.
It's just what you do
if you're an American girl
today.
It's part of your
job description,
especially if you want
to be a popular girl.
Deborah Tolman,
a director
at the Wellesley
College Center
for Research on Women,
concurs that sex
remains heavily weighted
in favor of boys'
needs and desires.
With regard to oral sex,
Tolman says,
the boys are getting it,
the girls know.
It's the heterosexual script
that entitles boys
and disables girls.
In her 2016 book
Girls and Sex,
Peggy Ornstein
describes talking
with girls
who explained to her
that giving oral sex
to a boy
doesn't feel
particularly intimate
or even personal.
Ornstein dryly observed,
I may be
of a different generation,
but frankly,
it's hard for me
to consider a penis
in my mouth
as impersonal.
When you ask
teenage girls
and boys
why they're having sex,
you'll hear
very different answers
from each gender.
Boys usually answer
that question
with a snort.
Why wouldn't I have sex?
As long as the girl
wants it too,
I mean,
as long as she
doesn't kick me
or yell fire,
why shouldn't I?
Boys want to have sex
because they feel
sexually aroused.
Simple.
It's different
for most girls.
In one major study,
girls didn't even
list sexual arousal
as a reason
for having sex.
Teenage girls
often engage
in sexual intimacy
for reasons
that are not related
to sexual fulfillment.
Girls may hope
that having sex
will earn them points
in the popularity contest
or they may just want
to please the boy
they happen to be
hooking up with
or they may feel pressured
either by the boy
or by other girls
who are having sex.
One fundamental change
that has occurred
over the past 30 years
is a change
from the female paradigm
to the male paradigm.
30 years ago,
a boy usually
had at least
to give lip service
to the notion
of being in love
if he expected
a young woman
to be sexually intimate
with him.
No longer.
That's the significance
of the hookup
replacing the romantic
relationship
as the primary
sexual mode
in teenage culture.
What's the result?
Barbara Defoe Whitehead
concluded
that the effect
of today's
sex-drenched teen culture
is not to help
young people learn
how to choose
a future life partner.
At best,
it helps them
only to
manage their sex lives.
But a sex life
without any emotional connection
is not the best preparation
for a lasting commitment
to a romantic partner.
Sexual satisfaction
may be another
casualty of the switch
to the hookup culture,
at least for girls
and young women.
In one study
of 24,000 students
at 21 colleges,
only about 40%
of the women
reported achieving
an orgasm
when the hookup
involved vaginal intercourse,
compared with 80%
of the men.
And that's only
for those hookups
that involved
vaginal intercourse.
By comparison,
the same researchers
found that about
three-quarters of women
achieved an orgasm
in their most recent episode
of vaginal intercourse
if that episode
occurred in the context
of a committed relationship.
Dr. Drew Pinsky
made an important observation
about the relation
of alcohol
to gender differences
in hooking up.
Both girls and boys
are usually partly
or totally drunk
when they hookup.
Remember the sexual assault
Jimmy perpetrated on Tina?
He was drunk
when he did that.
Not an excuse,
just a fact.
Dr. Pinsky found
that girls and boys
give completely
different reasons
why they get drunk
before they hookup.
Boys like to get drunk
because it slows down
their sexual response,
allows them to relax,
and decreases the likelihood
of premature ejaculation.
Girls like to get drunk
because it numbs
the experience for them,
making it less embarrassing
and less emotionally painful.
Among college students,
more than half of hookups
are preceded by alcohol use
and or drug use.
Good or Bad?
In the first edition
of this book,
published back in 2005,
I called attention
to the fact
that the hookup
was displacing romantic relationships
and that oral sex
was displacing vaginal intercourse.
In my book,
Girls on the Edge,
published in 2010,
I made the same points
even more emphatically
with an additional emphasis
on the ways
in which social media
were contributing
to the self-objectification
of girls.
Recently,
there has been
a slew of books,
such as American Girls
by Nancy Jo Sales
and the aforementioned
Girls and Sex
by Peggy Ornstein,
making the same points.
But a different tone
has crept into
the public debate as well.
Instead of lamenting
the changes
and trying to limit
the damage,
some writers
are applauding
the changes
and minimizing
the damage.
Hannah Rosen
wrote a lengthy article
for The Atlantic
about the new reality
of sexual intimacy
as told to her
by young Americans.
She challenged
the notion,
which she acknowledged
to be widespread,
that the new hook-up culture
is socially corrosive
and ultimately toxic
to women.
Rosen instead asserted
that hooking up
is an engine
of female progress.
Her argument
essentially boiled
down to this.
Girls and young women
today are so busy.
They have so much
they want to accomplish.
They don't have time
for a relationship.
Hooking up
is more convenient
and less demanding.
Plenty of women
enjoy having casual sex,
one Yale woman
told her.
The anthropologist
Peter Wood
read Rosen's article,
but he was not convinced.
In answer
to the Yale woman
who said
that plenty of women
enjoy having casual sex,
Wood observed,
If the cost of that view
is not immediately apparent,
it is still real.
The woman
who treats
her sexuality
as something
detachable
from strong
mutual attachment
to a single partner
sooner or later
discovers that men
regard her
as expendable.
Rosen and her
like-minded apologists
for the hook-up culture
shrug.
What does it matter
what men think?
But the pretense
that sex
is just sex
is never true.
There is no such thing
as sex
without consequences.
Their experience
is perhaps
summed up
in the lines
spoken by a female
character
in the 2001 movie
Vanilla Sky.
Don't you know
that when you sleep
with someone,
your body
makes a promise
whether you do
or not?
Broken promises
like that
add up.
Wood concludes,
The sexes
are complementary.
The distortion
of women's sexuality
plainly distorts
men's sexuality
as well,
though in a more
deferred way.
Men,
instead of learning
how to be responsible,
committed partners
and eventually
husbands and fathers,
learn that the
pleasure-seeking
dimension of their
sexuality
can be sustained
with relative ease.
As a result,
the men shun
social maturity.
The women
who are veterans
of the hook-up culture
find that,
once they are in it,
their options
for getting out
are reduced.
All of this
distorts
and diminishes
the lives
of those
who are caught up
in the pursuit
of sex
without attachment.
They eventually
become those
for whom
genuine attachment
is far more difficult.
The true meaning
of sex
is that it leads
somewhere,
somewhere beyond
orgasms and the
excitements of strangers.
An older generation
called that
somewhere
marriage.
The end result
of multiple
sexual encounters
outside the context
of a romantic
relationship
may be a lessening
of the ability
to form and sustain
a healthy and lasting
romantic relationship.
And that may be true
for both girls
and boys,
for both women
and for men.
we can't say
for sure yet.
We don't have
a decades-long study
in which girls
and boys
were randomly
assigned to
participate either
in the hook-up culture
or in the dating culture.
And I'm not holding
my breath
waiting for such a study.
I wouldn't volunteer
my daughter
to participate.
Would you
volunteer yours?
I didn't think so.
Playing a role
Many kids
don't date anymore.
Hooking up
has become
more common.
As a result,
scholars find,
adolescent sexual
intimacy is now
often determined
not by romantic
attraction,
but by group
affiliation.
What does that mean?
To use the jargon
employed by psychologists
who study
teenage dating,
romantic pairs
form most often
on the basis
of rank order
in popularity
rather than
personal characteristics.
Here's what that means.
When 14-year-olds
hook up,
they do so
less on the basis
of romantic attraction
and more on the basis
of how popular
the teenager is
in the teenager's group.
The most popular
boy at the party
hooks up
with the most popular girl.
The second most popular
boy goes out
with the second
most popular girl
and on down the line.
And a primary
determinant of popularity
among teenagers
is physical attractiveness.
Some years back,
I was leading
a conversation
among high school students
on the topic
of sexual intimacy
and romance.
I asked the group
what they thought
about dating.
Only ugly people date,
one boy said
authoritatively.
Startled,
I asked the group
to raise their hands
if they agreed
with the boy.
The great majority
of the kids
raised their hands.
Now,
raise your hands
if you do not agree.
I said.
Nobody raised
their hands.
This is how
the high school students
see it.
If you're popular
and good-looking,
you won't have
any trouble
finding someone
at the party
who will hook up
with you.
If you're not attractive
but you want
some action,
your best bet
may be to find
somebody who's
as ugly as you are
and date them.
For more than
150 years,
beginning with
British epidemiologist
William Farr
in 1858,
researchers have
consistently found
that marriage
has benefits
for both men
and women.
In particular,
both men and women
who are married
are healthier
and are less likely
to be depressed
on average
compared with
unmarried men
and women.
So,
it's tempting
to speculate
that the kids
who are following
a more old-fashioned
social script
might benefit
from a commitment-focused
style of dating.
But the same
may not be true
for teenage romantic
relationships
with or without
the sex.
Teens who began
a romantic relationship
in the past year
are more likely
to report
being depressed
compared with teens
who are not
in a romantic relationship
and the effect
is bigger
for girls
than for boys.
Likewise,
teens who engage
in sexual intimacy
are more likely
subsequently
to become depressed
and that effect
is much stronger
for girls
than for boys.
Hooking up,
engaging in sexual intimacy
outside of a romantic
relationship
is more likely
to lead to depression
than is sexual intimacy
in the context
of a romantic relationship.
In one study,
young teen girls
who had sex
with boys
were more likely
subsequently
to become depressed
than were girls
who didn't have sex.
But young teen boys
who had sex
with girls
were not at all
more likely
to become depressed.
In some studies,
young women
who engage in sex
are at increased risk
for depression,
but young men
who engage in sex
are actually
at decreased risk
for depression.
Why is sexual intimacy
in adolescence
more likely
to lead to depression
in girls
than in boys?
Are girls
just more fragile
than boys?
I don't think so.
Researchers find
that teen girls
and boys
often approach
sexual intimacy
with different scripts.
Girls are more likely
to be looking
for a steady relationship
and they see
sexual intimacy
as an important stage
in cementing
that relationship.
Boys know that script.
A boy may play a role,
deceiving the girl
with a promise
of a relationship
that he may not fulfill.
When the boy
abandons the girl
after a few episodes
of sex,
the girl is likely
to become depressed.
The boy,
not so much.
That also helps
to explain
why romantic relationships
in adolescence
are associated
with a higher risk
of depression,
whereas marriage
in adulthood
is usually associated
with a lower risk
of depression.
Many boys
are faking it.
They are pretending
to be lasting partners
in a relationship
when in fact
they are not.
A man who marries
a woman is not,
let us hope,
faking it.
He really intends,
in most cases,
at least at the beginning,
to be a lasting partner
in a relationship.
So, the boy misleads
the girl
in order to get sex.
But that's not
always the story.
I know a boy
who was immensely
committed to a girl
who happened
to be more popular
and better looking
than he was.
Such relationships
tend to be unstable.
Adolescent romantic
relationships
last longer
when they are
a match
between teens
of roughly equal popularity
and attractiveness.
Anyhow,
when the girl
dumped him
after about eight weeks,
he was plunged
into despair,
convinced that his life
was over.
He started cutting himself
with razor blades.
We all want
our children
to grow up
to enjoy
a loving,
mutually supportive,
and lasting relationship.
Many parents imagine,
reasonably enough,
that romantic relationships
in adolescence
provide good practice
for more serious
relationships
in adulthood.
You can't run
before you walk.
Practice makes perfect.
Some psychologists
who study romantic
relationships
in adolescence
are coming
to a different conclusion.
Practice makes perfect
only if you're
practicing the right task.
Most adolescents
aren't.
Psychologists
Wendell Fuhrman
and Elizabeth Wehner
have studied
adolescent romantic
relationships
over many years.
For middle school
and even most
high school students,
they report that
adolescents are not
very concerned
with the fulfillment
of attachment
or caregiving needs.
Instead,
their focus is on
who they are,
how attractive they are,
and how it all looks
to their peer group.
Adolescents
often develop
bad habits
in their dating relationships.
A boy may get
in the habit
of regarding his girlfriend
as a source
of sexual gratification
without really connecting
with her as a human being.
A girl may get
in the habit
of seeing her romantic
partner as a
trophy boyfriend
without any idea
of how to integrate
him into her life.
And both of them
may get in the habit
of dumping
their current partner
whenever a better-looking
or more popular one
becomes available.
Over time,
Fuhrman and Wehner
have found
these individuals
may become
more skillful,
but more skillful
in developing
the relationships
they have come
to expect.
By the time
they reach adulthood
and it's time
to build a marriage
that will last
a lifetime,
they have accumulated
all sorts of bad habits
that they need to break.
They might be better off
had they never had
those teen relationships.
There are other reasons
to be skeptical
about the value
of romantic relationships
in early adolescence.
According to one
large survey,
kids who become
sexually active
before 15 years of age
are three times
more likely
to be regular smokers,
four times more likely
to have tried marijuana,
and six times more likely
to drink alcohol
once a week or more.
Maybe we should regard
sexual relationships
in the same way
we regard
alcoholic beverages,
as an adult pleasure
to be enjoyed
by adults only.
Like alcoholic beverages,
romantic relationships
can be wonderful
when responsible adults
are partaking.
But if unprepared teens
use them,
they can be deadly.
Drunk driving kills.
So can HIV-AIDS.
And the boy
who gets in the habit
of exploiting
his girlfriend sexually
while ignoring
her emotional needs
is setting himself up
for a lifetime
of frustration
and loneliness.
Likewise,
the girl who engages
in sexual intimacy
with one boy
after another,
month after month,
year after year,
without sustaining
a serious romantic commitment
may find it more difficult
to connect lasting romance
with sexual intimacy,
to remain satisfied
with a single romantic partner,
if she ever chooses to marry.
Chapter 7.
Drugs and Alcohol
Caitlyn
Caitlyn was never a superstar.
The youngest of three children,
she always seemed content
to hang back in the shadows
while her two older brothers
took the limelight.
Alex, the oldest,
was the smart one.
He earned an A
in every class
without ever seeming to study
and was accepted early
to his first choice school,
the University of Pennsylvania.
Aaron, the middle child,
was a jock.
Soccer in the fall,
basketball in the winter,
lacrosse in the spring.
Aaron was the first sophomore
at our high school
ever to be named a starter
on the varsity soccer team.
The following year,
he led his team in scoring.
By December of his junior year,
he had received invitations
to visit some NCAA Division I
soccer programs,
including Clemson
and Virginia Tech.
Jill, their mother,
was a full-time mom
who attended
every one of Aaron's games.
Caitlin seemed happy
to tag along
and cheer her brother on.
Because Caitlin
had always been withdrawn
and shy,
parents Jill and Harry
were concerned
she might have problems
when she started middle school.
Jill read Odd Girl Out
and many of the other books
parents of girls
are supposed to read nowadays.
On nights when Jill
and her husband
went to bed
at the same time,
Jill would read Harry
excerpts from those
parenting books.
If Harry complained,
she would say,
You need to be prepared.
She's your daughter, too.
Middle school
is supposed to be
a tough time for girls.
But Caitlin
sailed through.
In eighth grade,
she blossomed.
Over a period
of about ten months,
she shed her baby fat
and became a slender
and attractive teenager.
When she started high school
the following year,
her popularity soared
and her social calendar
became crowded.
Every weekend,
she received
a barrage of invitations
to go shopping,
to go to a party,
or just to go
to a friend's house
to hang out.
Nevertheless,
her grades
actually improved.
She became obsessive
about homework.
By her sophomore year,
she was spending
an average of three hours
a night on homework.
Her parents,
especially Jill,
marveled at her stamina,
her discipline.
She's our late bloomer,
Jill told her husband.
Caitlin's weekends
were filled
with homework
during the day,
then parties
or group trips
to the movies
Friday or Saturday night.
Caitlin begged
her parents
for more money
to buy the latest fashions.
Harry objected
that Caitlin's
clothes budget
was way out of line.
We're spending more
on her clothes
than we spent
on Alex and Aaron
combined,
he said.
And what she's buying
isn't so fabulous,
if you don't mind
my saying so.
We're paying
Neiman Marcus prices
for Walmart clothes.
One hundred dollars
for a pair
of faded blue jeans?
But she's a girl.
Girls' clothes
cost more,
and girls care more
about clothes,
Jill said.
Boys can wear
the same thing
over and over again,
and nobody cares.
If a girl wears
the same outfit
twice in a month,
other girls notice.
Secretly, though,
Jill had to admit
that Caitlin's
spending was excessive,
and Caitlin didn't
show good judgment
about prices.
But Jill was so pleased
to see her daughter
finally coming
into her own,
finally taking center stage,
that she couldn't
bring herself
to talk to Caitlin
about it.
She'll only be
a teenager once,
Jill thought.
Let her have
this chance.
The college counselor
said that Caitlin
was a shoe-in
for the University
of Maryland,
but Caitlin
wanted to go
out of state.
As Caitlin
began her senior year,
Jill and Harry's
biggest concern
was whether they
would be able
to afford tuition
for an Ivy League
school without
cutting back
on contributions
to their own
retirement plans.
In retrospect,
all the telltale
signs were there.
But when the phone
rang at 3 a.m.
that Sunday morning
early in November,
Jill had no clue
that Caitlin
had been hiding
a secret.
Jill thought
at first
that the phone
call must be
a wrong number
or a crank call.
Hello?
She mumbled
into the phone.
Hello,
my name is Kathy.
I'm a nurse
at Shady Grove
Hospital Emergency Room.
Are you the mother
of Caitlin Morrison?
The nurse asked.
Yes, of course,
Jill answered.
Caitlin's friends
brought her here
about two hours ago,
the nurse said.
Caitlin is still
unconscious.
she tried
to commit suicide.
That's impossible,
Jill said immediately,
instantly wide awake.
How,
what makes you say that?
We found empty bottles
of Xanax and Vicodin
in her purse,
the nurse said
matter-of-factly.
Her talk screen
is positive
for Xanax and Vicodin.
And we found
a suicide note.
A suicide note?
How,
what does it say?
Jill asked.
Then,
before the nurse
could answer,
she said,
no,
wait,
how is she?
How is she?
Please let her be all right,
Jill prayed.
Suddenly,
she found it hard to breathe.
Tears welled in her eyes.
Will she be okay?
Dr. Sorensen
just told me
that Caitlin
is stable enough
to be transferred
upstairs
to the intensive care unit,
the nurse said.
Normally,
we put teenagers
in a special part
of the PEDS ICU,
but the PEDS ICU
is completely filled,
so she'll be
in the regular ICU.
Oh my God,
Jill said,
trying to grasp
what was happening.
Harry was still snoring.
We've seen
two other girls
just in the past week
with the same story,
exactly the same
combination of drugs,
the nurse said.
OD'd on Xanax
and Vicodin.
Those girls
came in
just like Caitlin,
and I can tell you
both of them
pulled through okay,
so hopefully Caitlin
will pull through
this fine too.
I'll be right there,
Jill said.
When Jill arrived
at the hospital,
Caitlin was already
in the intensive care unit.
I'm sorry,
visiting hours
don't start
until 8 a.m.,
the unit clerk
told her.
But I'm her mother,
Jill said impatiently.
I understand,
the clerk said.
If you'll just
have a seat,
I'll see whether
the nurse can come out
and speak with you now.
The nurse,
a pleasant middle-aged
woman named Rosemary,
explained that ICU policy
didn't allow visitors
in the middle of the night,
not even parents.
But don't worry,
the moment Caitlin
starts waking up,
I'll buzz you in,
visiting hours or no,
Rosemary said.
She's still asleep?
Jill asked.
She's unconscious,
Rosemary said,
but Dr. Feingold
expects her to regain
consciousness by morning.
Who's Dr. Feingold?
Jill asked.
Dr. Feingold's
the attending physician.
He's an intensivist.
What's an intensivist?
Can't he do something
to wake her up now?
Jill asked.
I'll tell you what,
Jill,
Rosemary said patiently.
Don't worry about
the details of your
daughter's medical care.
Leave that to us.
Caitlin is going to be
just fine,
medically speaking.
You need to be
focusing on other things.
Like what?
Jill asked plaintively.
Like what you're going
to say to Caitlin
when you see her.
I'll just tell her
I love her,
Jill said,
and her voice
trailed off.
She realized
that she still
had no idea
why her daughter
had done this.
Here's the suicide note
they found on her,
Rosemary said.
It was in her purse,
on the top,
where she knew
we would find it.
She held out
a folded sheet of paper
to Jill.
Jill nodded
and took the paper
without opening it.
Thank you,
she said.
Ask the clerk
to buzz me
if you have any questions,
Rosemary said.
I'm working a twelve hour,
so I'll be here
when visiting hours start.
Jill waited
until Rosemary
had gone
before she looked
at her daughter's note.
After the first
two paragraphs,
she began to cry,
so she stumbled
to the women's restroom.
Mercifully,
no one else was there,
giving Jill some privacy
as she read
her daughter's confession.
Dear Mom and Dad,
I'm so sorry
to be doing this.
I know how much
this will hurt you,
but there just isn't
any other choice for me.
I guess you guys
still don't know
that I've been doing drugs
for a long time now.
I started in eighth grade.
At first,
I just used Adderall
to lose weight,
and it worked.
I really thought
I could get away with it.
It was so easy
to fool you guys
along with everybody else.
Everybody just looked
at the surface.
People saw how thin I got,
and everybody thought
it was just great.
They envied me.
They never wondered,
how did that fat girl
get so thin?
Adderall was wonderful,
except for the palpitations
and the nausea
and the headaches.
But that seemed like
a small price to pay.
Then I started
having panic attacks.
So, say hello to Xanax.
Even with Xanax, though,
I never could get
really calm inside.
Until I discovered Vicodin.
For a while,
I thought I could
still pull it off,
especially because I knew
other girls were doing it.
I felt like I was juggling
a dozen balls in the air
all at once.
Maybe I could just
keep juggling forever.
I had a routine.
Adderall in the morning,
Adderall and Xanax at lunch,
Xanax after school,
Xanax and Vicodin at bedtime.
No problem.
Then the drugs stopped working.
Not all at once.
Gradually.
I tried taking more.
I increased the Vicodin
to two a day.
Then four.
Then six.
Then ten.
The side effects
got to be awful.
I thought about stopping
all the drugs,
just going cold turkey.
But that would mean
going back to being
fat and stupid.
I could never get
the grades I was getting
without the boost
from the drugs,
and I couldn't stand
the thought of being
fat and ugly
and stupid again.
Once you've tasted
the glory of being
everybody's favorite girl,
how can you give that up?
The truth is
that the real me
is an ugly,
fat,
stupid girl.
I hate her.
And I just can't
go on pretending,
taking drugs,
and trying to fool people.
And I hate having
to lie to you guys
about what I'm spending
all the money on,
about how I'm able
to stay up all night
studying,
about how I lost
all that weight.
And I don't want
to be the person
I really am.
I don't like that person.
She's ugly
and stupid
and fat.
Please forgive me.
Love always.
Caitlin
Different drugs,
different highs.
Girls and boys
turn to drugs
for different reasons.
For example,
girls are far more
likely than boys
to use stimulant
medications
such as Adderall,
Vyvanse,
Concerta,
and Medidate
specifically for the
purpose of losing weight.
Girls use drugs
like Xanax and Vicodin
to relieve stress,
to calm down,
and because their
friends are doing it.
Most boys get involved
with drugs
for different reasons.
Most boys who abuse drugs
are looking for a thrill.
And they want the excitement
of doing something dangerous.
Remember the chapter
about risk,
about boys'
risk-taking behaviors?
Boys are more likely
to buy illegal drugs
from strangers,
while girls are more likely
to buy their drugs
from people they know.
What do teenagers
themselves say about it?
In a nationwide survey
of 6,748 adolescents
selected to be
geographically
and ethnically
representative
of the entire
United States,
researchers found
consistent gender differences
in the reasons
teenagers give
for using drugs,
alcohol,
and cigarettes.
Girls were 16 times
more likely than boys
to say that they smoke
in order to keep
their weight down,
for example.
Boys were more than
three times as likely
as girls to say
that they smoke
in order to look cool.
Likewise for alcohol.
Teenage boys are more
likely to drink
because they want
to feel intoxicated
or because they want
to impress their friends.
Teenage girls
are more likely to drink
as a way of coping
with stress.
Let's start by looking
at some of the reasons
why girls and boys
use drugs and alcohol.
Then we'll look
at what you can do
as a parent
to keep your child
from experimenting
with drugs and alcohol
in the first place
or to get them
to stop using
if they've already started.
Risk Factors
Caitlin's story
illustrates some
of the leading risk factors
for drug use
among girls,
a negative self-concept
coupled with anxiety
and or depression.
By contrast,
boys are more likely
to use drugs
and to get drunk
because they're looking
for a high,
a thrill.
I have seen a few boys
who use drugs
and or alcohol
as a way of coping
with stress,
but that's less common
among boys
than among girls.
Among adults,
by contrast,
I have seen a great
many men
who use drugs
or alcohol
as a way of coping
with stress,
but this is a book
about children
and teenagers,
not adults.
Caitlin thought
she was stupid
and fat.
She compared herself
negatively
with her brilliant
brother Alex
and her athletic
brother Aaron.
There was nothing
about herself
that she was proud of.
Adderall helped her
lose weight
and gave her the energy
to stay up late
so she could do
long hours of homework
every night,
night after night.
Girls who feel stressed
and depressed
are more likely
to start using drugs
and alcohol,
but that's less true
for boys.
Later in this chapter,
we'll explore
some reasons
for the difference.
Caitlin's story
also illustrates
how academic stress
can precipitate
and perpetuate
a girl's use of drugs.
Don't underestimate
the stress
your 12-year-old daughter
is telling you about.
From your perspective
as an adult,
whether she gets
an A or a B
in Spanish
is not a matter
of world-shaking importance,
but in her world
it may be.
The best way
to protect a girl
like Caitlin
from falling
into the drug trap
is to find ways
to strengthen
her self-confidence
and self-concept
and to de-stress
her environment.
Remember those
heartbreaking words
at the end
of Caitlin's suicide note.
The real me
is an ugly,
fat,
stupid girl.
I don't want
to be the person
I really am.
I don't like
that person.
She's ugly
and stupid
and fat.
Your job
is to change
the way Caitlin
evaluates herself
so that she's
focusing not
on how she looks
but on who she is.
Good parenting
requires knowledge,
insight,
and understanding.
It's your job
as a parent
to know your child,
not only to know
who she is right now
but also to sense
who she could become,
where her hidden
strengths lie.
You have to know
your child
better than
she knows herself.
And you have to
resist the tendency
to push your child
in a direction
that worked for you
or for one
of your other children.
In this case,
Caitlin's parents
were programmed,
so to speak,
by their two older children,
Alex and Aaron.
They had come to think
that all kids
were either
jocks or brains.
Caitlin was neither,
so,
with all due respect
to her parents,
Jill and Harry,
they assumed
that Caitlin
didn't have
any special talent
of her own.
Were they right?
Rosemary,
the nurse
in the intensive care unit
was right about
Caitlin's medical prognosis.
Caitlin regained
consciousness
the morning
after she was admitted,
just as Rosemary
had predicted.
Jill was at
Caitlin's bedside
when she woke up.
I didn't die,
were Caitlin's
first words
to her mother.
Jill couldn't tell
whether Caitlin
was relieved
or disappointed.
Two days later,
Dr. Feingold
cleared her
for medical discharge,
and Caitlin
was transferred
to Potomac Ridge,
an inpatient
psychiatric facility.
After two weeks
of group therapy,
as well as
Welbutrin
and Lexapro,
two antidepressant
medications,
the doctor said
that Caitlin
was ready
to go home.
She's so much
more relaxed now,
Jill told me.
I don't know
whether that calmness
is just the medications
or whether that's
what Caitlin
is really like
when she's not
taking Adderall.
I wish she didn't
have to take
any medication
at all.
The psychiatrist,
Dr. Himelfarb,
insisted that Caitlin
would have to stay
on the medications
for at least six months,
probably longer.
Those were the same
six months
during which she was
supposed to decide
which college
to go to.
She had to take
a grade of incomplete
in two of her subjects
that fall.
Caitlin was worried
that her college
applications would be
in jeopardy
because of those
incompletes,
but I sent letters
to the colleges
saying that she'd been
hospitalized for three weeks
because of an
unspecified illness.
In the end,
she was accepted
at most of the colleges
she applied to.
In the meantime,
Caitlin discovered
something she enjoyed,
something she was
really good at.
With Dr. Himelfarb's
approval,
she started volunteering
as an aide
at Potomac Ridge.
Because she had been
an inpatient there
herself,
and because she was
still a teenager,
she had special
credibility with the
teenage inpatients.
One evening,
the aides on duty
at Potomac Ridge
were talking about
Malia,
a 14-year-old girl
who had been put
in the isolation room
again after hitting
an aide.
Malia had been
at Potomac Ridge
for five days.
This was her third
time in isolation.
That girl's a bad
number,
a real mean one,
said Sophie,
one of the aides.
She's the sort
who'd just as soon
kill you
as look at you.
Two other aides,
Tanisha,
and Ruthann
nodded.
Do you mind
if I go in
and talk with her?
Caitlin said.
Sophie,
Tanisha,
and Ruthann
just stared at her.
You crazy?
You want to die?
Sophie finally asked.
That girl will
eat you alive
and spit out
your bones.
Caitlin shrugged.
Do you mind
if I try?
She repeated.
Sophie and Ruthann
watched through
the small window
of the locked room
as Caitlin sat down
on the bed
across from Malia.
They couldn't hear
what Caitlin was saying
and at first
it didn't seem
to be having any effect.
Malia remained
sitting on the floor
in a corner,
huddled in a tight
fetal ball
with her head
between her knees.
But after Caitlin
had been talking
for about a minute,
Malia looked up.
Sophie and Ruthann
were amazed
to see an enchanting
smile on Malia's face.
You know,
that girl is almost
pretty when she smiles,
Sophie said.
Caitlin stayed
in the room
with Malia
for two hours.
When she knocked
on the door
to be let out,
Malia was by her side.
Malia's coming
out with me,
Caitlin said.
Not a question,
but a statement.
She won't need
to be in the locked
room anymore.
Sophie looked
suspiciously at Malia.
Malia nodded.
I won't hit anybody,
Malia said,
as long as I can
talk with Caitlin
on the nights
when she's here.
Caitlin went
to Potomac Ridge
every evening
for the next two weeks,
spending an hour
or more each night
with Malia,
mostly listening,
sometimes talking.
Nobody knew
what they had said
to each other,
but everybody could see
that Malia had changed.
She wasn't violent anymore,
she didn't shout
or scream anymore,
and she started
sleeping at night.
What do you girls
talk about?
Dr. Osenik,
the attending psychiatrist,
asked Caitlin
just before Malia
was discharged.
Not much,
Caitlin said.
I tell her
about myself a little.
I tell her
how bad I used to feel,
how I used to hate
my body,
hate my life.
You know,
Dr. Osenik said,
if you ever become
a professional therapist,
one of the first things
you'll learn
is that you shouldn't
tell your client
too much about yourself.
The focus of therapy
should be on the patient,
not on the therapist.
Then I guess
I won't ever be
a professional therapist,
Caitlin said mildly.
Caitlin was accepted
to Cornell.
She went to visit
the campus
in late April.
She still hadn't decided
which college
she would go to,
but Cornell was the only
Ivy League school
to which she had applied.
She stayed overnight
in one of the dorms.
How'd you like it?
her mother asked her.
It was scary,
Caitlin said.
All the kids
seem so grown up
and some of the girls
there are really skinny
and it's out
in the middle of nowhere.
I mean,
Ithaca is like
a gazillion miles
from anywhere.
When Caitlin said,
some of the girls
there are really skinny,
a chill went
through Jill's heart.
Caitlin had gained
30 pounds
in the months
since her suicide attempt.
She was up to
140 pounds
at 5 feet 4 inches tall.
Jill thought Caitlin
looked beautiful,
but she was worried.
On the other hand,
what parent
wouldn't want their child
to go to an Ivy League college?
In May,
Caitlin decided
to decline the offer
from Cornell
and go to Towson instead.
I need to stay
close to home,
she said,
and I want to keep
volunteering at Potomac Ridge
at least a few days a month.
I'm going to be
a therapist someday.
I think it's clear
in retrospect
that Caitlin's talents
lay in her ability
to care about people.
It's easy
to be critical
after the fact,
but maybe Caitlin
wouldn't have started
using drugs
if her parents
had tried harder
earlier
to find Caitlin's
areas of strength
instead of just
taking her along
to watch Aaron
play soccer
and lacrosse.
When Caitlin
was younger,
she loved to be
around animals.
Suppose her parents
had signed Caitlin
up to volunteer
at the zoo
or at an animal shelter
in our town
where no animal
is ever euthanized.
Empathic children
like Caitlin
often love
to care for animals.
If her mother
had driven Caitlin
to volunteer
at the zoo,
even if it meant
missing some of Aaron's
games,
Caitlin would have
gotten the message
that her interests
mattered just as much
as Aaron's triumphs
on the field.
More generally,
if Caitlin's parents
had made a higher
priority of spending
more time with Caitlin
just for Caitlin,
she might not have
felt like such a failure
compared to her brothers.
And specifically,
if Caitlin's parents
had known more
about what was going
on in her life,
including holding her
accountable for the
money they gave her,
even something as simple
as asking to see receipts
for the clothes she bought,
they would have discovered
that she wasn't buying
expensive clothes at all.
She was using the cash
to buy drugs,
then picking up
some old clothes
cheap at Goodwill
and claiming that she
had spent the money
on new clothes.
In retrospect,
her parents were astonished
at their own gullibility
in allowing themselves
to be taken in
by such a ploy.
I mentioned a moment ago
how the stress
of high expectations
can lead girls
to start using drugs.
What can you do
about that?
You have to show
your daughter
that there are other ways
to relax besides
taking Xanax
or getting drunk
or smoking a joint.
Join her for a long
walk in the park
or introduce her
to prayer or meditation.
Share with her
your own ways of coping.
You can build a bond
and hopefully decrease
the risk that she will
turn to drugs
when she needs to relax.
One mom I know
likes to bake a cake
when she's feeling stressed
and she's taught
her two daughters
to do the same.
Maybe that's not
the lowest calorie way
to relax,
but it's a lot safer
than illegal drugs.
Comfort cooking,
she calls it.
These measures
are less likely
to work for boys,
though.
Boys are different.
Ethan
Mike and Uta
adopted Ethan
when Ethan
was almost two years old.
He had been born
to a young woman
who was incarcerated
after being convicted
of selling drugs.
In addition to
selling drugs,
the woman admitted
to using crack cocaine,
heroin,
and meth
while she was pregnant.
The woman had given
Ethan up for adoption
when he was born.
He had been in a series
of foster care placements
from birth
until the time
Mike and Uta
adopted him.
Mike was a research physicist
at the National Institute
of Standards and Technology.
Mike had always
been a geek.
He'd met his German wife,
Uta,
while doing a three-year
post-doctoral fellowship
at the Max Planck Institute
in Germany.
Mike and Uta
shared a love
of the novels
of Thomas Mann,
the music
of Gustav Mahler,
and Mosel Wine.
They used to refer
to themselves
as the 3M Club.
Mann,
Mahler,
and Mosel.
Mike,
in particular,
was a great believer
in the power
of a good upbringing.
He was confident
that he would be able
to raise his adopted son
to share his tastes
and his hobbies.
Wrong.
Uta and Mike
soon were getting
a crash course
in infantile masculinity.
Ethan loved
to smash things,
throw food,
collide into furniture
head-on at full speed.
Within a few weeks
of Ethan's arrival
in the home,
Uta had packed
everything breakable
away in boxes,
labeling the boxes
carefully,
and then stacking them
in the basement.
Ethan found his way
into the basement,
tore open one of the boxes,
and stomped on the china
Uta had so carefully
packed away.
After that,
they started calling Ethan
the little criminal,
and they treated him
like one too.
They barricaded
those parts of the house
that were off-limits
to Ethan,
and they kept him
on a leash,
literally,
at the mall.
Uta and Mike
had originally planned
to adopt two or three children,
but after Ethan arrived,
they decided one was enough.
I first met Ethan
when he was 15 years old,
5 feet 10 inches tall,
180 pounds,
and in 9th grade.
He was already a star
in basketball and football.
We even heard a rumor
that one of the big
high schools down county
was trying to steal him away
to play for their teams.
Ethan's grades
had been mediocre
all through middle school,
C's and D's
across the board,
except for an A
in physical education.
But when grades
came out
for the first marking period
of 9th grade,
they were worse.
He had failed
English and Spanish
with D's
in his other subjects.
He still had his A
in physical education,
though.
His father, Mike,
decided that it was time
to make a change.
He can finish
the football season,
Mike said to me.
There are only two games
left in the football season,
but no basketball.
Sports are taking up
too much of his time.
There's just no way
he should be spending
two or three hours a day
on sports
when he's failing
English and Spanish.
Don't you agree?
I paused.
Honestly, I'm not sure
I do, I said.
I'm not convinced
that taking Ethan
out of sports
will improve
his academic performance.
In fact,
it might backfire.
Doctor,
with all due respect,
Mike said,
that makes no sense.
The more time
he spends on sports,
the less time
he has for school.
Mike and Uta
pulled Ethan
out of sports.
We want what is best
for you,
Uta told Ethan.
We want for you
to be able
to go to college.
I don't want
to go to college,
Ethan said.
Sometimes you have
to do things
you don't like
in order to get
the things you want
later,
Mike chimed in.
But what I want
is to play basketball
right now,
Ethan complained.
How is taking me
off the basketball team
going to help me
play basketball?
Uta and Mike
looked at each other,
the same despairing glance
they had exchanged
so many times
over the years.
Why can't Ethan
understand,
was what the glance
said.
When he started
high school,
Ethan had hung out
with the jocks.
But you can't hang
with the jocks
if you're not
on the team,
or it's hard
at any rate,
especially if you're
a freshman.
One month into
basketball season,
the season that
Ethan was not
a part of,
he was drifting.
He was supposed
to come straight home
every day after school
and work on his
homework,
but he wasn't.
Instead,
he was hanging out
in the high school
parking lot,
catching rides
to Rockville
and the District
of Columbia
with the older boys,
coming home
late at night.
The first week
of December,
Uta smelled
the sweet,
pungent odor
of marijuana
on Ethan's clothes.
She spoke with Mike
that evening.
They decided
to confront Ethan.
To their surprise,
he didn't deny
using pot.
Yeah,
I smoke pot,
so,
he said.
But you never
smoked pot before,
Mike said.
That's because
no athlete's
gonna smoke pot
because pot messes
with your reaction time,
Ethan said,
raising his voice.
Your reaction time
is what it's all about,
see?
But you made me
quit basketball,
so why the hell
shouldn't I smoke
some pot?
Please don't swear,
Ethan,
Mike said.
Right,
no goddamn swearing
allowed in this house,
Ethan said.
No,
nothing allowed
in this house.
Ethan,
we're just concerned
for you because
pot damages
your brain.
You said it yourself,
pot slows your reaction
time,
Uta said.
I don't need this shit,
Ethan said
and walked out the door.
They didn't see him
again for three days.
After Ethan had been
missing for two days,
they notified the police.
We need to report
that our son is missing,
Mike told the officer
at the police station.
The officer listened
to Mike's story,
then the officer said,
he's not missing,
he's a runaway.
What's the difference?
Mike asked.
Missing means you don't
know what happened
to the person.
Maybe they were abducted,
you don't have any idea.
Runaway means a juvenile
under 18 deliberately
left home.
Your son is a runaway.
Runaway seemed like
the right word
to describe the cascade
of events
over the next six months.
Ethan began stealing money
from his parents routinely,
brazenly,
once even taking money
out of Uta's purse
while Uta watched him do it.
Uta and Mike
bought a safe.
They began locking
their valuables
in the safe
at all times,
even when they were at home.
Ethan flunked ninth grade.
Mike and Uta
consulted with a psychiatrist
who specialized
in adolescent drug addiction.
The psychiatrist recommended
that Mike and Uta
allow Ethan
to play football.
According to school rules,
Ethan will be allowed
on the team
only if he can maintain
his GPA above flunking.
Right now,
Ethan's got no motivation
to succeed,
the psychiatrist told them.
At least being on the team
will give him
some motivation.
And we'll get him
in a random
drug testing program.
If he tests positive,
he's off the team.
At six feet and two hundred pounds,
Ethan towered over
the other JV football players
the following fall.
But the coach kept him
on JV just the same.
He needs to learn
some discipline,
the coach said.
Sure enough,
Ethan brought his grades up
to a C average.
But rejoining the team
didn't eliminate
Ethan's drug habit.
He wasn't stealing anymore,
but he was still using drugs.
Uta could smell pot
on his clothes
and she found traces
of pot or drug paraphernalia,
mostly cigarette wrapping papers,
in his clothes.
Where is he getting the money?
Uta asked Mike one night
as they lay in bed together.
And how is he able
to pass the drug tests?
I don't want to know,
Mike said
and turned on his side
away from his wife.
I'm going to sleep.
This is your brain on drugs.
Remember what we talked about
in the chapter on risk?
Danger doesn't reliably
deter boys.
It may even spur
some boys on.
Educating boys
about the dangers of drugs
can be counterproductive.
You may stimulate
the behavior
you're trying to discourage.
Did you ever see
that old commercial
where the man shows
an intact egg
and says,
this is your brain?
Then he cracks the egg
and puts it in a frying pan.
It sizzles
and he says,
this is your brain
on drugs.
That sort of commercial
works reasonably well
with girls.
Girls watch the commercial
and think,
hmm,
I don't want my brain
to end up like an egg
frying in a pan.
Not so with boys.
Especially not with
the sensation-seeking,
risk-taking boys
who are at greatest risk.
Those boys see the frying egg,
hear the narrator say,
this is your brain
on drugs,
and think,
way cool.
I totally want
to fry my brain.
Where can I get
some of that stuff?
I know a teenage boy
who wallpapered his room
with the
this is your brain
on drugs poster
and other posters like it
warning of the dangers
of drugs.
This boy uses drugs
and he wants everybody
to know it.
Mike and Uta
meant well
when they warned
their son
about the dangers
of drugs.
Uta,
like most women,
thought that
telling her son
about the dangers
of drug use
would decrease
the likelihood
that he would
use drugs.
After all,
any sensible person
would avoid
using a substance
that damages
the brain,
right?
Right.
But many 15-year-old boys
are not sensible people.
They are 15-year-old boys.
What could Mike
and Uta
have done differently?
I think they should
have followed
my advice
in the first place
as far as leaving
Ethan on the team.
Would that have
prevented Ethan
from using drugs?
Maybe.
Maybe not.
Participation
in competitive sports
has been proven
to be an effective
strategy for decreasing
the risk of drug use
among teenage girls.
But it's not been shown
to have a reliable
protective effect
for boys.
Researchers have found
that girls
who participate
in all-girls,
school-sponsored sports
are significantly
less likely
than other girls
to use drugs
and alcohol.
But girls
who participate
in out-of-school sports
are actually
somewhat more likely
to use drugs
or alcohol,
especially if the
out-of-school sport
is co-ed,
such as surfing.
By contrast,
boys who participate
in school-sponsored,
male-dominated sports,
such as football,
are slightly more likely
than other boys
to use drugs
or alcohol.
Why the difference?
Why might
school-sponsored sports
decrease girls'
use of drugs
and alcohol
while that's not
true for boys?
It goes back,
I think,
to issues of self-concept.
Participation
in extracurricular activities
and especially
in competitive sports
raises girls'
self-concept
and self-efficacy.
They come to feel
that they are more
in charge
of their own destiny.
Low self-concept
is a major risk factor
for drug and alcohol
use among girls,
so raising self-concept
lowers the risk
of drug and alcohol
use among girls.
But boys are different.
Many boys drink
or use drugs
because they're
sensation-seeking
or because they want
to look cool.
Playing sports
doesn't decrease
their interest
in sensation-seeking
or wanting to look cool.
It may be the case
that some boys
who are the greatest
risk-takers
are also the most likely
to participate
in competitive sports,
in which case
participation in sports
may be a marker
for boys who are
at higher risk
for drug and alcohol use
without being the cause
of that increased risk.
On the other hand,
I think Ethan
had a point
when he told his parents
that an athlete
wouldn't smoke pot.
As Ethan said,
if he is no longer
an athlete,
then he feels
fewer reservations
about smoking pot.
Of course,
there was more
going on here
than a cool calculation
on Ethan's part
of the pros and cons
of smoking pot.
He was angry
at his parents.
After talking
with Ethan myself,
I concluded
that he was smoking pot
for multiple reasons.
In order to relax,
in order to enjoy time
with his friends,
and also because he knew
it would upset his parents.
Ethan was smoking pot
partly as a way
of expressing his anger
toward his parents.
Many parents assume
that their teenager
is using drugs
as a way of expressing
rebellion against their parents.
That's not true
as often as parents
think it is.
And even when it is true,
it's seldom
the main motivation.
But it can be
a part of the story
as it was
in Ethan's case.
Look in the mirror.
We've laid out
some of the basic
differences
between girls and boys
in terms of
why they use drugs
and alcohol,
as well as a few
of the risk factors
and protective factors
that increase
or decrease
the likelihood
of their using
drugs and alcohol.
Now, let's talk
about concrete action
you can take
to decrease
the likelihood
that your daughter
or son
will use drugs
or alcohol.
Look in the mirror.
If you have
a drinking problem,
don't waste your time
talking to your daughter
or son
about drugs or alcohol.
Your word
has no credibility.
As I wrote
in my book,
The Collapse of Parenting,
you cannot teach
your child a virtue
that you yourself
do not possess.
If you smoke
cigarettes,
you're stepping up
to bat with
two and a half
strikes against you.
You smoke
ten cigarettes a day,
I smoke two joints
a week,
and smoking marijuana
is legal in lots
of states now.
What gives you
the right to tell me
that what I'm doing
is wrong?
That's what one
teenage boy told
his mother after
she warned him
about the dangers
of smoking pot.
Mom tried to answer
that marijuana
is more dangerous
than tobacco.
Her son responded
with facts and figures
purporting to show
that tobacco
is more dangerous
than pot.
Mom thought
that her son
was inventing
most of the facts
and figures
and maybe he was.
But you don't want
to get bogged down
comparing the relative
risks of marijuana
and cigarettes.
If you've used
drugs in the past,
don't mention it
unless you have
no choice.
Don't try saying,
I used pot
when I was your age
so that's how
I know how bad
it is.
Your teen has
many good responses
ready for that one
including,
Maybe it was bad
for you,
maybe it wouldn't
be so bad
for me.
You're not me.
Why shouldn't
I be allowed
to try something
you did yourself?
You turned out
okay, didn't you?
So it couldn't
be that bad.
If your teen
confronts you
and demands
to know
whether you
used pot,
tell the truth,
but don't boast
or brag.
Acknowledge your
mistake,
but don't try
to use your
prior experience
for any advantage
when you talk
with your child.
Alcohol
When I was in school
back in the 1970s
and 1980s,
it was common
to hear about
boys getting drunk.
Girls,
not so much.
Today,
across the English-speaking
world,
girls and boys
are just about
equally likely
to use
and abuse
alcohol.
The gender gap
in alcohol use
among teenagers
has dwindled
nearly to zero.
But the risks
of alcohol use
are greater
for girls
than for boys.
Girls and young
women appear
to be more
vulnerable to
the toxic effects
of alcohol
than are boys
and young men,
even after adjusting
for differences
in height and weight.
Drinking too much
alcohol damages
girls' brains
differently and
more severely
than the same degree
of alcohol abuse
affects same-age boys.
studies looking
at the brains
of teenagers
who drink alcohol
have shown
some really
astonishing
sex differences.
For example,
the prefrontal cortex
is the part
of the brain
involved in
decision-making,
balancing risk,
and benefits.
Teenage girls
who drink alcohol
have significantly
smaller prefrontal cortex
volumes than
teenage girls
who don't drink alcohol.
But teenage boys
who drink alcohol
actually have
slightly larger
prefrontal cortex
volumes than
teenage boys
who don't drink.
More recent studies
have confirmed
and extended
these findings.
Alcohol affects
girls' brains
differently from
boys' brains.
In another study,
researchers followed
teenagers who drank
alcohol from age
17 through age
29.
They found that
even if a girl
stopped drinking
completely in her
20s,
that girl who
had been a drinker
at age 17
was more likely
than a boy
who had been
a drinker
at age 17
to have
long-term issues
with drug use,
psychiatric problems,
and poor adjustment
to life in general.
These sex differences
are now well-known
among researchers
who study alcoholism,
but they are not
well-known
to the rest of us.
I have found
that some people
are uncomfortable
with this information.
To them,
it seems sexist
to suggest
that alcohol
is more toxic
to women
than to men.
But pretending
that girls
are no different
from boys
puts girls
at risk.
Nowhere is that
clearer than
when we are
talking about
alcohol abuse.
The day
everything changes.
When you talk
with your kids
about drugs,
stick to the facts.
But keep in mind
that which facts
are relevant
depends on
whether you're
talking to a daughter
or a son.
Remember that
girls get
most of their
drugs from friends
and that the
transaction usually
takes place
in a private home.
Know where
your daughter is.
Know who
her friends are.
Talk to her
friend's parents.
Ask her to check
in with you
frequently
throughout the day.
Keep tabs on her.
Make sure she knows
that you will be
checking up on her.
And verify her
statements openly
with her cooperation.
If she says
that she's at
Melissa's house,
ask her to call
you back using
Melissa's home phone
rather than
the cell phone.
Look at your
caller ID.
Does the number
match Melissa's
home phone number?
Make sure your
daughter understands
what you're doing
and why.
That knowledge
will actually
empower your
daughter to
refuse unsafe
requests.
If her friends
invite her to go
downtown to
somebody else's
home, she can
tell them,
No, I can't
because my mom
makes me call
her from
everybody's
house and
she'll see
from her
caller ID
that I'm not
where I told
her I'd be.
For 13 and
14 and 15
year old girls,
that technique
really does work.
I wish my mom
cared that much
about me,
is what one
girl said after
another girl I
know explained
her mom's
requirements.
What about
boys?
My experience
is that the
approach I just
outlined for girls
is ineffective
for most boys.
First of all,
the strategy of
asking your teen
to call you
from the home
of a friend
is a non-starter
with many boys.
Boys who
check in
with their
parents will
be ridiculed
by other boys
as your son
will quickly
learn.
Second,
remember that
boys are more
likely to purchase
drugs from a
stranger,
outdoors,
in a park,
or on the
street,
so keeping
track of which
particular house
your son is
visiting is less
relevant.
Regarding drug
education,
the evidence of
the past 30
years suggests
that educating
boys about the
dangers of drugs
is a waste of
time.
On the contrary,
emphasizing the
harmful, mind-blowing,
damaging effects of
drugs can boomerang.
That approach will
pique the interest of
thrill-seeking boys.
Remember that these
are the same boys who
go snowboarding down a
steep mountain without
taking a lesson first.
So, what works with
boys?
My recommendation is
clear and consistent
discipline.
Tell your 14-year-old
son,
If I catch you
drinking or smoking
or using any kind
of drugs, we'll take
the PlayStation and
lock it away for the
three months that
you're grounded.
Many teenage boys
prize mobility and
independence.
Tell your 15-year-old
son,
If I catch you
using drugs, you
won't be driving
until you're 18,
not 16.
Tell your 17-year-old
son, If I catch you
drinking or using
drugs, you lose the
car keys for six
months, minimum of
six months.
These measures may
seem extreme, but they
can also be life-saving,
and these strategies
work for boys.
Many parents don't
think their kids are
doing drugs.
Other kids maybe, but
not their kid.
Then comes the day when
they find out.
Mom discovers drug
paraphernalia in her
son's pants pocket, or
Dad finds an
incriminating email
message on his
daughter's computer.
What do you do now?
First, establish the
prohibition.
Second, offer
alternatives.
Establish the
prohibition.
Whether you have a
daughter or a son, you
need to make clear that
you absolutely prohibit
the use of illegal
drugs.
Offer healthier
alternatives.
But the right
alternative may depend
on whether we're
talking about a girl
or a boy.
If your daughter is
smoking in order to
relax, you need to
help her find other
ways to loosen up.
If your daughter is
using a friend's
Vyvanse to lose
weight, you need to
offer her safer ways
to lose weight.
Or better yet, help
her to accept herself
as she is and shift
the focus away from
how she looks.
Take a look at my
book, Girls on the
Edge, for more
strategies I've learned
about working
effectively with
girls who are too
concerned about their
appearance.
If you have a son
who's a risk-taker, a
son who's using drugs
because he's looking
for a thrill, you need
to help him explore
safer, healthier ways
to get that risk-taking
tingle.
You and he might look
into snowboarding,
skiing, mountain
biking, motocross,
mountain climbing, and
bouldering.
Wait a second, you're
thinking.
You've just discovered
your son is using
cocaine.
I'm telling you to
buy your son a snowboard
or a mountain bike?
Am I saying that you
should reward your son
for using drugs?
I'm not saying that you
can't discipline your son
or your daughter, for
that matter.
But it's not enough just
to take away your
daughter's cell phone or
your son's driving
privileges.
You have to offer
alternatives.
Positive alternatives
that ease your
daughter's anxiety or
satisfy your son's
desire for excitement.
The other objection I
hear from parents of
sons in this situation
is that the alternatives
I'm suggesting are
risky.
Your son could break
his leg snowboarding.
He could crack a rib
mountain biking.
That's all true.
But those risks are
healthy risks.
When your son allows
a drug dealer to stick
a needle in his arm,
your son has entered
a much darker world.
Chapter 8
Social Media and
Video Games
Jason is sixteen.
His sister Sonia is
fourteen.
They come from a
stable home with two
loving parents.
Mom and Dad are
concerned about Jason.
He's not working hard
at school and his
grades are sliding.
He spends most of his
free time playing
video games like
Grand Theft Auto or
Call of Duty or
surfing the web for
pictures of girls.
Both parents are
actually quite proud of
Sonia.
She is a straight-A
student and an athlete
and she has many
friends.
But when I meet with
Sonia, she tells me
that she isn't sleeping
well.
She wakes up in the
middle of the night
feeling guilty about
having eaten a whole
slice of pizza at
supper.
She often has
palpitations and
shortness of breath.
She has just started
cutting herself with
razor blades secretly
on her upper inner
thigh so her parents
won't see.
She hasn't told her
parents any of this.
On the surface, she is
the golden girl.
Inside, she feels that
she is falling apart.
Her brother Jason, on
the other hand, is
happy as a clam.
He can eat a whole
pizza without the
slightest remorse.
He has no difficulty
sleeping.
In fact, his parents
had to kick him out of
bed at noon on a
Saturday.
He likes to spend his
free time hanging with
his two buddies who are
just like him, playing
video games and looking
at pictures of girls
online.
Jason and Sonia both
spend much of their free
time looking at screens
in ways that were not
possible 20 years ago.
Jason is playing high-speed
online video games and
looking at high-resolution
images of girls.
Sonia is posting to
Instagram and sending
pics via Snapchat.
Neither of these apps
existed before 2010.
There has been a huge
change in the lived
experience of children
and teenagers, it's
happened really fast, and
it has affected girls and
boys differently.
Imagine a girl living in
ancient times, by which I
mean 1992.
She's in her bedroom.
She's writing in her
diary, which is to say
she's writing with a pen
in a bound volume of
blank pages.
She's writing about whom
she doesn't like, why
she doesn't like them, the
kind of girl she really
does like, the kind of
woman she hopes to
become.
She might write five
pages in an evening.
She's not going to show
those five pages to
anybody.
If she has a younger
brother, she may even
keep her diary under lock
and key.
But she's doing some
important work.
She's figuring out who
she is and what she
really wants.
Figuring out what you
really want is not
trivial.
The American psychologist
Dr. Abraham Maslow
believed that many
adults never figure it
out.
And they're miserable
because they're working
hard at jobs they don't
like in pursuit of goals
that are not meaningful to
them.
So, this girl, living
back in the 1990s, writing
in her diary, is doing
something meaningful.
She is connecting with
herself.
Now, fast forward to the
modern era.
It's unusual today to find
any kids who are writing
in a diary.
When I meet with middle
school or high school
students, I often ask them,
who here is on Instagram?
Almost all the hands go up.
Who here is on Snapchat?
All the hands go up.
Who here has a diary?
No hands.
Then I say, let's expand
the definition of a diary.
It doesn't have to be a
bound volume of blank pages.
Let's define a diary as
anything that you write in
from time to time, even if
it's just a file on your
tablet, that is private.
It's not for a school
assignment.
Nobody else will ever see
it.
Defining a diary that way,
very broadly, anything that
you write in from time to
time, electronic or
otherwise, that nobody else
will ever see, who here
has a diary?
Still no hands.
Then, in an auditorium with
three hundred kids, one girl
raises her hand.
Incidentally, I'm not saying
that there is anything wrong
with kids who write public
blogs, but those blogs are
not diaries.
They serve a different
function.
They are still a kind of
public performance, not a
private self-exploration.
Social media have displaced
the diary in the lives of
many girls.
There's not enough time for
both.
Everybody's busy, and social
media matters more because
other kids are watching.
Girls and boys use social
media differently.
A boy and a girl both go to a
football game.
They both take pictures at the
football game, but the boy is
more likely to take a picture
of the game, or the pretty
cheerleader, at the game.
The girl is turning the phone
on herself and taking dozens of
selfies at the game.
That evening, she goes through the
selfies to find two or three
where she's laughing and the kids
around her are laughing, and
that's what she posts on
Instagram.
Here I am at the game.
We had a great time.
If you don't like Jacob's photo of
the pretty cheerleader, he may not
care.
But if you don't like Michelle's
photo of Michelle, she's going to
take it more personally.
So Michelle is staying up until
midnight, photoshopping her
picture for Instagram.
These differences are especially
marked in the realm of sexuality.
A girl is much more likely than a
boy to post a photo of herself
wearing a bikini.
Boys are more likely to post a
selfie of themselves with a new
trophy, or one where the emphasis
is otherwise on something the boy
has done, rather than on how he
looks.
If you don't like Jake's selfie
showing off his new 55-inch
flat screen, he may not care.
But if you don't like Ashley's photo
of herself wearing her new bikini,
she's more likely to post a photo of
