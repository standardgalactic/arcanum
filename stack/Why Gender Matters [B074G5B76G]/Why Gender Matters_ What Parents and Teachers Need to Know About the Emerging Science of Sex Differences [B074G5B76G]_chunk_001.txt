put a tape recorder in a boy's locker room and listened to the banter.
Your mama's so fat, she sat on an iPad and turned it into a flat-screen TV.
Your mama's so fat, they used Google Earth for her school photo.
Your mama's so dumb, she thinks Taco Bell is a phone company in Mexico.
Your mama's so old, I told her to act her age and she died.
Playful aggression as a mode of relationship is hardwired into many males,
not just in our species, but in other primates.
Differences between girls and boys are natural.
Evidence from monkeys and chimpanzees suggests that those differences are hardwired to a substantial degree.
Those differences should be acknowledged, accepted, and used appropriately.
Instead, many educators today seek to eradicate gender-specific behaviors.
In particular, many schools now actively discourage and punish aggressive play.
Many school districts have banned kids from playing dodgeball on school playgrounds
in the belief that it encourages violent behavior.
Some schools are taking these prohibitions to the extreme, banning even games like tag.
Body contact is inappropriate for recess activities, asserts Doris Jennings,
principal of Woodland Elementary School in Silver Spring, Maryland.
Other school districts threaten expulsion for kids who throw snowballs.
It's getting crazy.
Ten-year-old Johnny Jones walked to the front of the classroom to get a pencil.
On his way back, his friend pretended to shoot at Johnny.
In response, Johnny pretended to pull back on an imaginary bow and arrow and shoot an arrow back.
A girl promptly told the teacher that the boys were shooting at each other.
The teacher took the two boys into the hall and reprimanded them.
The teacher then sent Johnny to the principal.
The principal suspended Johnny and informed Johnny's mother, Beverly,
that her son could be expelled on the grounds that Johnny had violated the school's weapons policy.
Beverly Jones retained an attorney.
After three months of legal back and forth,
the school agreed to back down and remove Johnny's suspension from his record.
John Whitehead, an advocate for the child,
observed that the school's actions amounted to criminalizing the imagination.
Whitehead also advises kids,
Don't joke around in school.
Being a boy, doing things boys have always done,
like saying bang, bang, you're dead,
can now get you in deep trouble.
The basic premise underlying the arguments against dodgeball
and saying bang, bang and throwing snowballs is this.
If you prevent boys from engaging in pretend violence,
then boys will be less violent.
In my book, Boys Adrift,
I explored the evidence on this point in greater depth
with attention to boys who have engaged in actual violence,
boys such as Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris,
the two school shooters at Columbine High School in April 1999.
In fact, there is no evidence that preventing boys from engaging in pretend violence
will in any way decrease the likelihood that they will engage in actual violence,
such as the massacre perpetrated by Klebold and Harris at Columbine High School.
Instead, prohibiting playful boy games may actually increase the likelihood
that the suppressed aggression will manifest itself in less healthy ways.
You can try to drive out nature with a pitchfork,
yet nature will always return, according to the old Latin proverb.
The boy disengages from school and devotes his energies
to getting to the next level in Call of Duty or Grand Theft Auto,
games that reward the boy's enthusiasm for aggressive play.
The solution to taming a boy's aggressive drive
is not to squelch the drive every time it appears.
Banning dodgeball from the schoolyard
makes as much sense as prohibition.
Instead, you want to transform the boy's aggressive drive.
Sublimate it into something constructive.
Julie Collins, a counselor at Georgetown Prep, a high school I visited,
explains it this way.
You can't turn a bully into a flower child,
but you can turn a bully into a knight.
Her motto?
Affirm the knight.
Here is a true story that exemplifies Julie Collins' principle.
A small town in rural Illinois was being terrorized by a local gang of teenage thugs.
Storekeepers who refused to pay tribute saw their stores vandalized.
One storekeeper made a wager that his clerk could beat the gang leader in a fight.
The gang leader accepted the challenge.
Most of the town turned out to watch the fight.
The storekeeper's clerk and the gang leader fought each other for what seemed like hours.
Finally, the clerk backed away and proposed that they call it a draw.
The fight ended in friendship, we are told,
and the clerk not only earned the group's respect, but became their informal leader.
The name of the clerk?
Abraham Lincoln.
In 1831, the town organized a militia to fight in the Black Hawk War.
The militia, comprised mainly of the young gang members, elected Lincoln to be their captain.
They remained loyal to him throughout the next 30 years
as he rose from storekeeper's clerk to president of the United States.
This archetypal but true story of the young Abe Lincoln
resonates with ancient traditions of male friendship.
The youthful leader often establishes his authority
by besting the strongest young tough in the neighborhood, one writer observes.
King Arthur beats the undefeated Lancelot,
and Robin Hood knocks little John off a bridge.
I would add that this tradition is even more ancient than King Arthur and Robin Hood.
It goes back to the very roots of recorded history.
The epic of Gilgamesh, dating back roughly 5,000 years,
begins with a similar fight between Gilgamesh and Enkidu.
As in all these stories, the two protagonists become close friends after the fight.
Indeed, the fight provides a solid foundation for the friendship and makes it lifelong.
It's a guy thing.
Many young boys get a thrill from violent or pretend-violent confrontation.
Most young girls don't.
I'm not saying that girls are never violent or aggressive,
just that girls seldom enjoy physical aggression and confrontation the way many boys do.
Girls are aggressive in their own way.
We'll get to that in a minute.
Sex differences diminish as a function of age.
I was giving an evening presentation to parents on this topic.
More than 300 parents were in attendance.
When I said,
Many boys enjoy confrontation in an aggressive setting, but most girls don't,
I saw a woman my age raise her hand.
I didn't call on her, though.
With an audience of more than 300, you have to do the Q&A at the end of the talk.
If you take questions all through the talk,
you might not get to the last slide before the 90 minutes are up.
When this woman saw that I wasn't going to call on her,
she got out of her chair and began stomping down the stairs toward the front of the auditorium
where I was speaking.
The stairs were not carpeted and her boots were making a racket as she stomped,
stomped, stomped down the stairs toward me.
Finally, I stopped trying to talk and waited a moment for her to get down to the front.
Yes, I said.
Dr. Sachs, I just want you to know something, she said, coming quite close to me.
I'm a litigator.
I enjoy confrontation.
I enjoy being aggressive.
And I'm a woman.
So that pretty much blows your theory to pieces, doesn't it?
I wasn't sure what to say.
Let me ask you a question, I said, trying to phrase the question in my mind.
When you were nine or ten years old, when you were in elementary school,
did you enjoy confrontation then?
Her face worked strangely.
I suspect that she wanted to say,
You're darn right I did.
But she couldn't say it.
Finally, she shook her head no.
I handed her the microphone.
I was different when I was little.
I didn't like people to shout at me.
If my teacher looked at me the wrong way, I'd burst into tears, she said.
When I first began work as a litigator, I wasn't any good at it.
The opposing attorney would mock me in open court.
I'd go into the ladies' room, hide in a stall, and just cry.
She took a breath.
But then I saw how these attorneys who would attack each other in court would hang out in
the bar afterward and trade jokes.
One afternoon, they invited me to join them, and I did.
That's when I began to figure it out, that the name-calling and the mocking is a game.
So I started playing the game.
I started making fun of them in open court just the way they had done to me.
And I started winning cases.
That was about ten years ago.
Now I'm just about the best there is in my field.
And I enjoy it.
But I see your point.
It took me some time to get where I am.
Sex differences diminish as a function of age.
As a practicing physician, I see middle-aged women who are bold and aggressive,
and I see middle-aged men who are not.
But it's unusual to find a ten-year-old girl who enjoys physical confrontation
or who loves to spend her free time playing violent games,
such as Call of Duty or Grand Theft Auto.
Violence, Girl Style
Mary is the mother of fifteen-year-old Julie.
Mary told me how Julie came home from her riding lesson with a funny look on her face.
Over supper, Mary asked what was wrong.
Nothing, Julie said.
Come on, you're upset.
Tell me.
Julie looked as though she might cry.
It's all the girls at the barn.
They hate me.
That's silly.
They're some of your best friends, Mom said.
Julie said nothing.
She gripped her spoon and looked at her soup.
You all went out together last Saturday to the horse show and then to dinner afterward,
Mary reminded her.
You told me you all had a great time.
That was just five days ago.
What makes you think they don't like you all of a sudden?
The moment I walked in the barn, they were all talking about me.
As soon as they saw me, they stopped, Julie said.
How do you know they were talking about you?
Mom asked.
Julie rolled her eyes.
It's obvious, she said.
She stirred her still untasted soup.
They all hate me now.
I said hi to Lisa, and she acted like I wasn't even there.
Lisa, of all people.
Can you believe that?
If it weren't for me, Lisa wouldn't have a single friend at the barn.
She wouldn't even be at the barn.
Tears welled in Julie's eyes.
It's all Karen's fault.
Karen hates me.
She's always hated me.
She's jealous of me because I'm a better rider and I have a nicer horse.
And now she's gotten the other girls to be mean to me.
The next morning, Julie announced she didn't want to ride anymore.
She'd been riding since she was six years old.
Don't make me go back to that barn, she begged her mother.
Many parents in this situation might make the mistake of assuming that the problem is all
in their daughter's head.
They think that because the signs of aggression are absent, nothing is really going on.
Don't be deceived.
Odds are your daughter is right.
Girls and boys both fight, but they tend to fight differently.
Boys can be mean to one another, but the meanness is usually right there on the surface.
Riley puts a wad of sticky-used chewing gum on Mike's seat at the cafeteria table when
Mike isn't looking.
Mike sits down, realizes he's got somebody else's chewing gum on his butt, and looks
around to see who did it.
Somebody points at Riley.
Mike hauls off and slugs him.
The two boys roll on the floor, hitting and kicking until Mike pins Riley down.
The teachers pull them apart and send both of them to the principal's office.
One day later, Mike and Riley may be sitting together at lunch, better friends than they
were before.
Provocation leading to a violent response followed by resolution.
That's the pattern with many boys.
But that simple pattern is less common among girls.
The surface of a girl fight can be as silent and smooth as a marble, observes Rachel Simmons.
Tension can arise so subtly that even the girls themselves sometimes can't honestly tell you
how it started.
A violent response is seldom appropriate and seldom made because the provocation may be hard
to define.
She ignored me in the hall even after I said hello to her.
She sat with Sophia instead of me at lunch, and she knows Sophia hates me.
She sighed when I spoke up in English class like I had said something stupid.
Tensions can simmer and build for weeks or months, corroding a friendship until there is
no friendship left.
Simmons uses the phrase alternative aggression to describe these ongoing wars among adolescent
girls.
It's a useful term because it reminds us that these ongoing tensions are a form of aggression.
Parents sometimes don't recognize the damage that alternative aggression can cause.
For one thing, the perpetrator is often a good girl, polite to adults and clever at hiding
the clues.
A girl who victimizes other girls in this manner is often the most socially skilled and may even
be one of the most popular girls, just the opposite of the typical boy bully.
Girl bullies are different from boy bullies.
Boys who bully often have few friends, may be socially inept, may not be doing well in school.
The boy bully picks on his victim as a way of improving his own status, at least in his own
eyes.
I can't be the biggest loser in the school if Jacob is terrified of me, he thinks.
But he probably doesn't know Jacob very well.
His bullying is motivated not so much by anything Jacob has done or said as by his own insecurities,
his vague hope that he will feel better by making someone else miserable.
He may also hope to ingratiate himself with other boys by picking on the victim.
When an unpopular kid is harassed by someone from a popular crowd, wannabes and posers may
take the incident as a signal that their own status can be improved by going after that
victim, observes Professor John Bishop of Cornell University.
The situation is almost completely reversed for girls.
Whereas boys often bully kids they barely know, girls almost always bully girls within their
social group.
These girls are intimate enemies.
They know each other.
They know where it hurts most.
Here's a summary.
Girls who bully typically have many friends, are socially skilled, are doing well in school,
know the girls they bully.
Boys who bully typically have few friends, are socially inept, are below average students,
don't know the boys they bully.
My workshop for schools on this topic is titled, The Four Bullies.
In that workshop, we identify four different kinds of bullying.
1.
Boy-on-boy bullying
2.
Girl-on-girl bullying
3.
Sexual harassment
4.
Hate-based bullying
Boy-on-boy bullying is what you might call classic bullying, where the big bully smashes
the geeky boy into the wall or smushes him into a locker.
Hate-based bullying refers to bullying based on race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, etc.
If white kids at a majority white school are picking on a Hispanic kid because he is Hispanic,
or if Hispanic kids at a majority Hispanic school are picking on a non-Hispanic child,
that's an example of hate-based bullying.
Even if it's all boys, it's not typical boy-on-boy bullying.
The strategies that are effective in stopping boy-on-boy bullying are different from the
strategies that work to stop hate-based bullying.
Boy-on-boy bullying often means the gender-typical boy is picking on the gender-atypical boy,
the jock beating up the geek, for example.
In Chapter 9, we will talk more about the gender-atypical boy and why he is often the
target of bullying.
Sexual harassment is a form of bullying, but the motivation is different.
The most common form of sexual harassment is a boy harassing a girl who has rejected his
advances.
In my observations at more than 400 schools, the schools that are most effective in preventing
sexual harassment are those that teach girls and boys to be ladies and gentlemen.
A gentleman does not harass a lady and a lady will not tolerate harassment.
In Chapter 12, I will have more to say about that.
Our focus at the moment is girl-on-girl bullying.
Why do girls do it?
I had the pleasure of having dinner one-on-one with Rachel Simmons, author of Odd Girl Out.
I told her that my favorite chapter in her book was The Bully in the Mirror, in which she admitted
that she herself had been a bully in middle school.
Yeah, everybody says that's their favorite chapter, Rachel told me.
But Rachel said that it was the hardest chapter for her to write because she had to portray herself
in a very unfavorable light, as the mean girl.
Nevertheless, it's an immensely important chapter because it teaches an important lesson.
Any girl can be a bully.
Only a small subset of boys will ever bully.
But any girl can be a bully.
The motivation for boy-on-boy bullying is pretty straightforward.
The boy bully gets a visceral pleasure out of beating up the smaller boy.
There have always been a small minority of boys and men who take pleasure in inflicting pain.
There are some girls who take pleasure in inflicting pain, but they are rare, much rarer than boys
who take pleasure in inflicting pain.
But any girl can be a bully.
So why is this girl being a bully?
The answer, to defend her social niche.
Let's say you're the popular athletic girl who's also really funny.
That's your niche.
Then another girl moves into town and enrolls at your school.
She's also athletic and she's also funny.
Everybody's talking about how funny the new girl is and what a great athlete she is.
You may feel that your niche is threatened.
So you might feel tempted to start spreading stories about how the new girl is arrogant and conceited
to turn your friends against her.
A grown-up would understand that there is room for more than one funny athletic girl in the social structure of any school.
But a 13-year-old girl is not a grown-up.
She's a 13-year-old girl.
The most effective strategies to prevent and rectify girl-on-girl bullying are,
in my observation, strategies that are employed school-wide.
I share some of these strategies in Chapter 5 of my book, Girls on the Edge.
If you are a teacher, counselor, or school administrator, or if you are planning to talk with a school employee,
I hope you will take a look at the strategies I share there.
But what are you supposed to do if you're a parent and you discover that your daughter is the
odd girl out?
The girl who's being ignored and ostracized by other girls?
Start by taking the problem seriously.
Don't dismiss or minimize it by telling her she's just imagining things.
Maybe she is being oversensitive, but maybe she's not.
It pays to find out.
When did the problems begin?
Who are your daughter's enemies?
Who's taking part in the campaign against her?
What might be motivating those girls?
Remember that other girls might ostracize your daughter not because of anything she has done,
but because she prompts other girls' envy.
As Simmons observes,
the girls who get ostracized are usually the ones who have what most girls are expected to want,
looks, the guy, money, and cool clothes.
Make an appointment to talk face-to-face with the guidance counselor.
Sometimes the counselor really knows the situation at the school.
Sometimes, unfortunately, the counselor is clueless.
Either way, you need to be sure that the counselor understands your level of concern.
Consider signing your daughter up for after-school activities that would involve her with a different group of girls.
Team sports are one option if she is so inclined.
Dance or drama may be a good choice.
Or horseback riding or swimming.
Of course, girls in these other activities can be just as prone to cliques and rivalries as the girls at her school,
but girls need connection with other girls.
By showing your daughter that you understand her situation
and that you're taking the problem seriously and doing your best to help,
instead of trying to talk her out of it,
you're already helping her feel better.
In extreme cases, you may need to talk with your daughter about other options.
Ask her how she would feel about transferring to another school.
If you're in the public school system,
the guidance counselor can often facilitate this transfer.
That's another reason why you'll want to be in touch with the guidance counselor throughout the process.
Sometimes, a transfer can be accomplished seamlessly over a semester break.
Watch for signs of clinical depression.
If your daughter is crying uncontrollably,
if she's lost interest in doing the things she used to enjoy,
or if, God forbid, she starts talking about suicide,
then you should seek professional help.
The experience of being shunned by other girls
can precipitate full-blown clinical depression
with the associated risk of suicide.
Don't hesitate to schedule a consultation
with a qualified psychologist or psychiatrist
if you have any doubt.
Don't wait.
Chapter 5. School
Melanie
Melanie was an academic superstar all through high school.
In 11th grade, she took advanced placement
AP English,
AP Spanish Language,
AP American History,
and AP Biology,
as well as Trigonometry.
Not only did she get straight A's that year,
but she also really seemed to enjoy each class.
She was especially interested
in the environmental science unit of her biology class.
Her biology teacher, Ms. Griffith,
recognized Melanie's talent and encouraged her.
With Ms. Griffith's help,
Melanie devised a science project
to test and correlate levels of pollutants
in samples of water taken from the Potomac River
at different points,
from Harper's Ferry in West Virginia
all the way down to Georgetown
and Anacostia in Washington, D.C.
Her project won second place
at an environmental science fair.
You're more than just smart,
Ms. Griffith told Melanie after the fair.
Lots of scientists are smart.
The great scientists
are those who have imagination.
Melanie beamed.
At Ms. Griffith's suggestion,
Melanie signed up to take AP Physics
in her senior year.
Ms. Griffith assured her
she wouldn't have any problem.
Physics will come naturally to you,
Ms. Griffith said.
You have an analytical mind.
The first day of physics class
seemed to go okay.
The instructor, Mr. Wallace,
plunged right in,
presenting formulas and equations
relating distance, velocity, and acceleration.
At the end of class,
as students were standing up
and gathering their books to leave,
he called out,
First seven problems in chapter one
due tomorrow.
The class groaned.
In writing, show your work.
Make it neat.
Hand them in at the start of class.
Melanie looked at the problems that evening.
The first five weren't too difficult.
The last two were harder.
They didn't seem to fit
any of the formulas in the book.
That semester, Melanie was also taking
AP Spanish Literature,
AP English,
AP European History,
and AP Calculus.
She had homework assignments
in each of those subjects as well.
She wrote out the answers
to the first five physics problems.
Then, rather than waste time
trying to figure out
the two remaining problems,
she decided to do her homework
in her other subjects
and to meet with Mr. Wallace
for help during her morning study period.
She didn't have any trouble
finding Mr. Wallace
during second period
the next morning.
He was in the physics lab
checking the equipment
for the first experiment.
She introduced herself
and then asked,
About the homework assignment,
I had a question.
The first five problems
were pretty easy,
but I had trouble
with the last two.
They didn't fit
any of the problems
that were solved
in the chapter.
Like the problem
where the boy is trying
to catch the bus,
the bus is pulling away
from the bus stop.
It's accelerating
at a constant rate,
which means that
its speed is increasing.
And we're supposed
to figure out
whether the boy
can catch the bus
and if so,
how long it will take him
to catch up with the bus.
She paused
to give Mr. Wallace
a chance to say something,
to suggest
how to solve the problem.
Mr. Wallace said nothing.
He glanced at her,
then looked out the window.
It was almost as though
he hadn't heard
anything she had said.
Would you like me
to show you the problem?
She asked,
taking her book out
and flipping to the page.
He shook his head.
It's right here
on page 22,
she began.
Mr. Wallace interrupted.
I think maybe
you're in the wrong class,
he said.
What?
Melanie asked.
Physics isn't for everybody,
Mr. Wallace said.
Ms. Griffith told me
what a hard-working
student you are.
In subjects like biology,
students who work hard
will do well.
But physics is different.
Either you have
the right kind of mind
for it or you don't.
But you don't even know me,
Melanie protested.
How do you know
what kind of mind I have?
I just don't want you
to hurt your grade point average,
Mr. Wallace said.
Ms. Griffith told me
that you're a straight-A student,
that you might be
the class valedictorian.
I'd hate for you to lose that
by staying in this class.
You're saying
I should drop this class,
Melanie said in disbelief,
after one day,
one homework assignment,
which we haven't
even discussed yet?
Mr. Wallace nodded.
I'm sorry, he said.
Melanie slammed her book shut
and left the room
without another word.
She wanted to go
to Ms. Griffith
and ask,
what is wrong with this guy?
Or maybe she would go
to the school counselor
and complain.
But she didn't either.
Instead,
she dropped the course.
If he doesn't want me
in his class,
then I don't want
to be in his class,
Melanie told me later.
I mean,
what if he gives me
a lower grade
just because he doesn't like me?
I have to think
about my college transcript.
I don't want to be
on my transcript
in the last semester
that colleges will see.
Some people would say
that this incident
illustrates the way
in which sexist male teachers
drive well-qualified girls
out of physics classes.
Those critics would point
to the fact
that Melanie was one
of only six girls
in a class of 23 students
as evidence that the school
was biased against
girls taking physics.
Those critics might also
mention the fact
that the homework problems
in this particular textbook
refer to boys,
almost never girls,
chasing after buses,
hitting baseballs,
driving race cars,
and so on.
That analysis
has some merit,
but I don't think
it's the whole story,
in part because I know Melanie.
Melanie was a victim, yes,
but not primarily
a victim of sexism.
She was more a victim
of Mr. Wallace's
lack of understanding
of the differences
in how girls and boys learn.
Here's my assessment
of what happened and why.
First, here's the why.
Girls and boys, on average,
have different expectations
for the teacher-student relationship.
Because teachers are often
unaware of those differences,
male teachers especially
often misunderstand
and misinterpret
the behavior
of their female students.
Most girls will naturally
seek to affiliate
with the teacher.
They expect the teacher
to be on their side,
to be their ally.
Most girls won't hesitate
to ask the teacher
for help when they need it.
Educational researchers
have found that girls
are more concerned
than boys are
with pleasing the teacher,
and are more likely
than boys to follow
the teacher's example.
Remarkably,
a similar finding
has been described
in our closest genetic relative,
the chimpanzee.
Anthropologists
who have spent many years
observing chimpanzees
in the wilds of Tanzania
report sex differences
in learning
similar to what we see
in human children.
Girl chimps
follow their teacher's example,
in this case,
regarding the proper way
to dig for termites,
while boy chimps
disregard the teacher,
preferring to do it
their own way,
or they ignore
the teacher's example
altogether
and go off to swing
from a nearby tree
or wrestle with
another male chimp.
The boy chimps
are consequently
much slower
to master the task
than the girls are,
a year or two slower
on average.
Sex differences
in how students
relate to their teacher
give rise to sex differences
in motivation to study
and in the weight
that students give
to their teachers' opinions.
As a result,
according to
educational psychologist
Eva Pomerantz,
girls are at greater risk
of being harmed
by a negative assessment
from a teacher.
Girls generalize
the meaning
of their failures
because they interpret them
as indicating
that they have
disappointed adults
and thus they are
of little worth.
Boys, in contrast,
appear to see
their failures
as relevant
only to the specific
subject area
in which they have failed.
This may be due
to their relative
lack of concern
with pleasing adults.
Girls are more likely
than boys
to do their homework
even if the particular
assignment doesn't
interest them.
Girls want the teacher
to think well of them.
Girls earn better grades
than boys do
in every subject
not because girls
have higher IQ scores
there are no sex differences
in general intelligence
but because girls
work harder
than boys do
they don't want
to disappoint the teacher.
Boys, on the other hand,
will be less motivated
to study
unless they find
the material
intrinsically interesting.
Likewise,
most boys
will consult the teacher
for help
only as a last resort
after all other options
have been exhausted.
The teacher I described
at the opening
of this chapter
whom I called
Mr. Wallace
was a student himself
once, of course.
When he was a student
he probably asked
the teacher
for help rarely
and only after
he had worked
long hours
over a problem.
When Melanie
asked him for help
on the second day
of class
Mr. Wallace
may have assumed
that she had been
working on the problem
for hours.
He knew from
Ms. Griffith
that Melanie
was a smart
hard-working student.
He may have thought
if this smart
hard-working student
has worked on this
problem for hours
and she still
can't figure it out
then she probably
doesn't belong
in my class.
When he suggested
that she dropped
the class
he may have been
sincerely trying
to act in her
best interests.
If Mr. Wallace
had taken a few
minutes to ask
Melanie how much
effort she had put
into solving
the problems
on her own
he would have
realized his mistake.
She hadn't spent
even five minutes
on those problems.
However,
Mr. Wallace
and Melanie
would still have
had to reconcile
their conflicting
educational styles.
If she had explained
to Mr. Wallace
that she was
asking him for help
before making
a sustained effort
to solve the problem
on her own
he might have been
surprised
even annoyed.
He might have
concluded that
maybe she wasn't
such a hard worker
after all.
Melanie would most
likely have sensed
his annoyance
and been irked
by his response.
Why shouldn't I
ask the teacher
for help?
Isn't that what
the teacher is there for?
Why should I waste
hours working on
the problem the wrong way
when the teacher
can show me the right way?
That's what other
girls have told me
in similar situations.
Melanie went on
to get straight A's
again that semester.
She was accepted
at her first choice
school,
the University of Maryland
and she went on
to earn a four-year
degree in business.
There's nothing wrong
with business
except that Melanie
never expressed
any interest in it
when she was
in high school.
She was really on fire
in that biology class.
I can't help
wondering whether
she might have gone on
to become the great
scientist Ms. Griffith
predicted she could be
if only her high school
physics teacher
had known more
about the different
educational styles
of girls and boys
if he had encouraged her
instead of pushing her
out the door.
Face to face,
shoulder to shoulder.
Friendships between girls
are typically different
from friendships
between boys.
Girls' friendships
are about being together,
spending time together,
talking together,
going places together.
Friendships between boys,
on the other hand,
usually develop
out of a shared interest
in a game
or an activity.
We might characterize
the difference this way.
Girls' friendships
are face to face,
two girls talking
with each other.
Boys' friendships
are shoulder to shoulder,
a group of boys
looking out at some
shared common interest.
Conversation is central
to most girls'
friendships at every age.
Girlfriends love
to talk with each other.
When they start
having trouble talking,
the friendship
is in trouble.
The mark of a truly
close friendship
between two girls
or two women
is that they tell
each other secrets
they don't tell
anyone else.
They confide in each other
about their most
personal doubts
and difficulties.
Self-disclosure
is the most precious
badge of friendship
between females.
When she tells you
a secret
she's never told
anyone else,
then you know
that you are truly
her dear friend.
Boys are different.
Most boys
don't really want
to hear each other's
innermost secrets.
With boys,
the focus is more often
on the activity,
not on the conversation.
Four boys
can spend hours
playing a video game
without exchanging
a single complete sentence.
You may hear screams
of agony
and shouts
of exaltation,
but you may not hear
much that qualifies
as conversation.
Girls' friendships
are, on average,
more intimate
and more personal
than most boys'
friendships.
That has advantages
and disadvantages.
The advantage,
of course,
is that each girl
derives strength
from the intimacy
of the friendship.
When a girl
is under stress,
she looks to other girls
for support
and comfort.
When girls
are under stress,
they want to be
with their friends
more.
When boys
are under stress,
they may just
want to be
left alone.
Many mothers
don't know
about these differences.
When a mother
sees that her son
is under stress,
she often tries
to comfort him.
Often,
she will be rebuffed
and she may take
the rebuff personally.
She shouldn't.
Psychologist
Shelley Taylor,
who has specialized
in the study
of gender differences
in the response
to stress,
summarizes her findings
this way.
Women maintain
more same-sex
close relationships
than do men.
They mobilize
more social support
in times of stress
than do men.
They turn to female
friends more often
and they report
more benefits
from contact
with their female
friends and relatives.
Girls' friendships
have different values
compared with
boys' friendships
on average.
Girls' friendships
focus on
one another.
Boys' friendships
focus on
a shared interest
in a game
or activity.
Girls' games
and sports
are an excuse
to get together.
Boys' games
and sports
are often central
to the relationship.
Girls' conversation
is central
to the relationship.
Boys' conversation
is often unnecessary.
Girls' hierarchies
and rank
destroy the friendship.
Boys' hierarchies
and rank
organize the camaraderie.
Girls' self-revelation
is a precious
badge of friendship.
Boys' self-revelation
is to be avoided
if possible.
These differences
are relevant
to education
for many reasons,
chief of which
is that girls
and boys
relate to teachers
differently.
For many boys,
being friends
with a teacher
may be a sign
of geekdom.
The coach
is often an exception
to this rule.
It's usually okay
for boys
to be friends
with the coach
as long as
the coach himself
is a real jock,
not a dork
or a geek.
Professor John Bishop
at Cornell University
writes,
In the eyes
of most students,
the nerds
exemplify the
I-trust-my-teachers-to-help-me-learn
attitude
that prevails
in most elementary school
classrooms.
The dominant
middle school crowd
is telling them
that trusting teachers
is baby stuff.
It is us,
the boys,
versus them,
the teachers.
Friendships with teachers
make you a target
for harassment
by peers.
Boys are not supposed
to suck up
to teachers.
You avoid being perceived
as a suck-up
by avoiding eye contact
with teachers,
not raising one's hand
in class too frequently,
and by talking
or passing notes
to friends
during class.
This demonstrates
that you value
relationships with friends
more than your reputation
with the teacher.
Girls are less likely
to think friendship
with teachers
equals geekiness.
On the contrary,
a girl student
may actually raise
her status
in the eyes
of her friends
if she has
a close relationship
with a teacher.
Especially if the teacher
is young,
cool,
and female.
I knew a young teacher
at an all-girls school
who occasionally
invited her favorite
girl in her class
to go to the movies
with her.
Being invited
to see a movie
with that teacher
is a major
status booster.
Being friends
with a teacher
is less likely
to boost a girl's status
if the teacher
is male
as other girls
may suspect
that she is using
her sexuality
to get a better grade.
But I think
that teacher
was making
a big mistake.
You don't want
to have favorites
because if you do
every kid
who is not
your favorite
may disengage.
If Sonia
is your favorite
Vanessa may feel
or even say
out loud
you don't care
about me
so I don't care
about your stupid
algebra.
By contrast
if the girl
believes that
you really care
about her
then she is more
likely to work
hard in your subject
not because
she suddenly
loves algebra
but because
she doesn't
want to let you
down.
She doesn't
want to
disappoint you.
With boys
it's different.
A boy
who is buddy-buddy
with the teacher
does not thereby
raise his stature
in the eyes
of his peers.
On the contrary
being friends
with the teacher
can lower
a boy's status
in the eyes
of other boys
if that boy
comes to be seen
as the teacher's pet.
And the average boy
is likely to be
less concerned
about disappointing
the teacher's
expectations
compared with
the average girl.
Girls are more
likely to assume
that the teacher
is an ally
and a friend.
Boys are less
likely to share
that assumption.
So when encountering
difficulties
girls are more
likely to consult
the teacher early.
Boys, as I said
a moment ago
usually consult
the teacher
only as a last resort.
And girls
are much more
likely than boys
are to ask a teacher
for advice
about personal matters
totally unrelated
to the academic
material.
Girls' friendships
work best
when the friendship
is between equals.
If you're a girl
or a woman
and you think
your friend
believes herself
to be better
than you
then your friendship
with her
is not likely
to last.
Boys are more
likely to be
comfortable
in an unequal
relationship
even if they
are the lesser
party.
The third string
linebacker may
relish being
the best buddy
of the star
quarterback.
He may not
resent the
quarterback's
higher status.
He may even
try to magnify
his friend's
status in the
eyes of others.
This male
characteristic
has roots
that go
very deep.
If you know
the stories
of Gilgamesh
and Enkidu
Achilles
and Patroclus
David son
of Jesse
and Jonathan
son of Saul
or Don Quixote
and Sancho
Panza
then you've
heard this
story before.
Those friendships
were not less
strong because
of the difference
in status
between the
friends.
On the contrary
the hierarchical
character of
the relationship
defined and
even ennobled
the friendship.
Jonathan made
a covenant
with David
because he
loved him.
We read in
the biblical
book 1 Samuel.
Jonathan took
off the robe
he was wearing
and gave it
to David along
with his tunic
and even his
sword, his bow
and his belt.
David didn't
give him anything
in return and
Jonathan didn't
expect him
to.
Jonathan said
to David,
You will be
king over
Israel and
I will be
second to
you.
Jonathan's
dream was
a world in
which his
hero David
would be
king and
he Jonathan
would be
the king's
right-hand
man and
Jonathan is
fine with
that.
These
differences
explain a
useful tip
that several
teachers have
shared with
me.
If you're
working with
a girl,
smile and
look her
in the
eye when
you're
helping her
with a
subject.
That's the
way girls
interact with
their own
friends.
Too many
teachers,
especially men,
don't make
eye contact
with their
female students.
I asked him
a question
and he
answered it
but he
just seemed
to be
talking into
empty space
or he was
looking at
his shoes.
He didn't
look at
me, one
girl said
to me.
He didn't
care about
me.
It was
almost like
I wasn't
even there.
I was
leading a
workshop for
teachers in
Yuba City,
California,
talking about
the importance
of making
eye contact
with students.
A young
man, a
teacher,
raised his
hand.
I'm sorry,
I'm not
going to do
that, I
think it's
inappropriate,
he said.
Inappropriate?
I repeated.
Yep.
The young
man explained
that he is
single and
he is
straight.
He is
teaching high
school seniors,
which means
17 and
18 year old
girls.
He explained
his concern
that if
others see
him smiling
and making
eye contact
with an
18 year old
female,
they might
think he
is flirting.
I understand
what you're
saying, I
answered, but
I'm not
suggesting that
you touch
her.
You can
keep 10
feet of
distance between
you and
always make
sure that
there are
other people
in the
room, but
you must
make eye
contact and
smile.
With support
from the
other teachers,
we gradually
persuaded the
young man not
to look at his
shoes when he
was talking with
a female student.
If you're
working with a
boy, sit down
next to him and
spread out the
materials in
front of you so
you're both
looking at the
materials shoulder
to shoulder.
Don't hold an
eye-to-eye stare
with a boy you
don't know well.
There are
different kinds of
eye-to-eye
contact, of
course, but
sustained eye-to-eye
contact among
males who are not
already good friends
can easily be
perceived as a
prelude to a
fight.
It may make the
boy uncomfortable
or even provoke
a hostile
response.
Another
application of
these differences
is that small
group learning is
a good teaching
strategy for
girls, but
seldom for
boys.
I was visiting
an eighth-grade
classroom in
Columbia, South
Carolina, science
class.
The teacher said,
Now I'd like you
to break into
your small groups.
I'd like you to
discuss the
differences between
cell walls in
plants and cell
membranes in
animals.
I was standing
next to a table
with four boys
at the back of
the class.
The four boys
looked at one
another.
One boy said
to another, who
was apparently
new to the
class,
So how long
you been living
in Columbia?
Imagine if the
boy responded,
Oh, we're not
supposed to talk
about that.
We're supposed
to talk about
cell walls in
plants and cell
membranes in
animals.
If a boy were
to say such a
thing, the others
would be astonished
by such a
display of
geekiness.
The boy would
be branded a
teacher's pet.
But of course
the boy said
no such thing.
He said,
My folks and I
just moved here
from Dallas
and I'm telling
you, I miss
Dallas.
You folks don't
have no football
here.
The other boys
gaped at him.
Then one said,
What do you mean
no football?
What about
Clemson?
What about
U of SC?
The boy from
Dallas waved his
hand with an air
of dismissive
superiority.
That's just
college football.
That's not
real football.
Now the four
boys embarked
on a lively
debate about
the comparative
merits of NCAA
Division I
football versus
the National
Football League.
And that was
the end of the
day as far as
cell walls in
plants compared
with cell
membranes in
animals.
Why is small
group work less
likely to be an
effective strategy
for boys, at
least in elementary
school and middle
school, compared
with girls?
First reason, girls
are more comfortable
asking the teacher
for help when they
need it.
If you give four
girls a group
assignment, you can
be confident that
if they get stuck,
at least one of
them will come to
you for help.
Not so with boys.
If four boys get
stuck, there's no
guarantee that any
of them will ask
the teacher for
help unless one
of the boys is a
geek, and even
geeks know that
asking the teacher
for help lowers
their status in the
eyes of the other
boys.
If the boys get
stuck, they may
just throw spitballs
and get rowdy
instead of asking
for help.
That leads us to
a second reason
why small group
self-directed
learning works
better for most
girls but not
for most boys.
Boys can raise
their status in the
eyes of other boys
by disrupting the
teacher's program.
If the teacher
breaks the class
into small groups
and two boys in
a group of four
start being
disruptive, those
boys raise their
status in the eyes
of at least some
of the other boys
in the room, no
matter how puerile
their behavior.
Incidentally, the
word puerile is
derived from the
Latin word puer,
meaning a young
boy.
There is no
pejorative word
corresponding to the
Latin puela, young
girl.
Like many sex
differences relevant
to education, these
differences diminish
as a function of
age.
You can often use
small group work
once boys are
seniors in high
school, but you
can't be confident
that those strategies
will work with boys
in elementary school
or middle school.
Hearing the Difference
In Chapter 2, we
noted that the
average girl hears
better than the
average boy.
Anytime you have a
teacher of one sex
teaching children of
the other sex,
there's a potential
for a mismatch if
only in decibel level.
If a male teacher
speaks in a tone of
voice that seems
normal to him, a
girl in the front
row may feel that
he is yelling at
her.
Conversely, if a
boy is at the
back of the room
with a soft-spoken
female teacher at
the front, he may
not hear her very
well.
Recall our earlier
discussion of the
misdiagnosis and
over-diagnosis of
attention deficit
disorder.
Some boys who are
not paying attention
may just need the
teacher to raise
her voice a bit,
about eight decibels
as we discussed in
chapter two.
This fundamental
fact is not taught
in most schools of
education.
When I speak to
teachers, they are
fascinated to learn
that girls and boys
do indeed differ on
average in how they
hear.
Experienced teachers
often figure this out
on their own, after
five or ten years of
teaching.
One veteran teacher
told me that she
puts the boys in the
front of the class and
the girls in the back.
That's pretty much the
opposite of how girls
and boys normally
seat themselves.
Here's the most
common arrangement when
kids are allowed to
seat themselves.
You will have two or
three highly motivated
boys sitting in the
front row, the rest of
the boys at the back,
and the girls in the
middle.
That's the natural way
for kids to seat
themselves because most
girls like to
affiliate with the
teacher and most boys
don't.
In chapter nine, we
will talk more about
the two or three boys
who do.
The teacher's guilty
secret.
The differences in how
girls and boys hear is
one hardwired reason why
both girls and boys are
shortchanged by a lack of
awareness of gender
differences.
Another reason has to do
with differences in the
way girls and boys respond
to threat and
confrontation.
I yelled at one of my
students one day.
Kate, a middle school
teacher, confessed to me.
I was going from desk to
desk, collecting the
homework.
I got to his desk and he
said, I didn't do it.
There was something about
his tone of voice, so
insolent.
I was just so frustrated
with him because Sam is a
smart boy, but he just
wasn't doing the work.
He never did the homework,
and that day he seemed to
be boasting about it.
So I just lost it.
I really let him have it.
I yelled at him in class in
front of the other
students.
I didn't mean to, but I
did.
Right afterward, I was
worried he'd never speak
to me again, Kate said.
I expected to get an angry
phone call from the
parents.
To be honest, I was
worried I might get
fired.
I mean, I yelled at him
in front of the entire
class.
But the next day, Sam
turned in his homework,
perfect and on time, for
the first time ever.
He even asked me whether
I would like to look at
his collection of
baseball cards.
Those baseball cards are
his most prized
possession.
He'd never shown them to
me or to any adult at the
school before.
Then, three weeks later,
his mom finally did call.
I was so nervous.
I was sure she was going to
be angry with me for
screaming at her son.
But she wasn't.
She was calling to thank me.
She didn't seem to know
anything about that episode.
She wanted to know what
magic I had used to get Sam
so energized about his
schoolwork.
I didn't know what to say.
I didn't feel I could tell
her what really happened.
I am not recommending that
you ever yell at a student
in class.
You should never lose your
cool in front of your
students.
But I think this difference
illustrates some of the
girl-boy differences that
teachers need to understand.
If I had done that with a
girl, I'm sure she wouldn't
have spoken to me for the
rest of the semester, at the
very least, adds Kate.
Plus, she probably would
have gotten half her
friends not to talk to me
either.
Female brains, male brains?
There was recently a flood of
news reports about an Israeli
study of the brains of men and
women.
According to the study authors,
there's no such thing as a
male brain or a female brain.
We are all a mosaic, a mix of
male and female.
The article received extensive
positive coverage in the media.
Kate Wheeling, a reporter for
Science Magazine, breathlessly
enthused that the report could
change how scientists study the
brain and even how society
defines gender.
Other scientists were more
critical of the Israeli study.
Researchers at Yale and
Massachusetts General Hospital
pointed out that if one were to
apply the standards of the
Israeli study to animals, it would
be difficult to distinguish cats
from dogs.
After all, there are few
characteristics that reliably
distinguish every cat from
every dog.
And the differences between a
St. Bernard and a Chihuahua are,
on many parameters, larger than
the differences between a
Chihuahua and a Siamese kitten.
Nevertheless, the researchers at
Yale and at Massachusetts
General Hospital, using data
similar to those used by the
Israeli investigators, were able to
classify 92% of brains as either
male or female, even after
controlling for overall size
differences.
Another Israeli, Dr.
Merrick Glezerman, criticized the
study on more fundamental
grounds.
The original study was just a
study of brain anatomy, not a
study of brain function.
No conclusions about brain
function can be drawn from a
study of brain anatomy, Dr.
Glezerman observed.
Just because you and I both own
Toyota Camrys doesn't mean that
we drive the same.
You may often drive recklessly, well
over the speed limit, while I always
drive cautiously below the speed
limit.
No superficial examination of the
structure of our cars will reveal
the important differences in how we
use the cars.
But the most important shortcoming of
the much-reported Israeli study was
that it was based almost entirely on
data from adults.
The big differences between girls and
boys are not in brain anatomy or brain
function, but in the pace and sequence
of development.
We now have very good evidence that
relatively small differences in age
can produce big differences in
outcomes.
For example, in one nationwide study of
more than 11,000 American students, the
youngest kids in the classroom were, by
eighth grade, roughly twice as likely to
be diagnosed with ADHD compared with the
oldest kids in the classroom, even
though in that study the difference
between the youngest kids and the
oldest kids was typically less than 12
months. But the difference in brain
development between girls and boys is
consistently greater than 12 months on
average. For example, in one large study
of brain development, the average girl
reached the inflection point, roughly the
halfway point in brain development,
indicated by the arrow in the graph on
the next page, around age 11, roughly
four years before the average boy as
shown in the same graph.
Different studies have given different
results, but every study of brain
development in children shows that boys
lag significantly behind girls in the
pace of brain development.
In chapter one, I related how, 20 years
ago, I started seeing a wave of young
boys flooding my office. Each boy's
parent carried a note from somebody at
the school, teacher, guidance counselor,
reading specialist, suggesting that Justin
or Brett or Carlos or Simon might have
ADHD. I evaluated each of these kids to
determine whether each one met the
criteria for ADHD. Some kids did meet the
criteria, others did not. I've already
mentioned how some of the boys who were
sent to my office with a presumed diagnosis
of ADHD actually were normal boys who were
sitting in the back of a class in which the
teacher was a young woman who didn't talk
very loudly. But there was another important
difference that the school was overlooking.
Girls and boys differ in the speed at
which they mature. For example, researchers
at Wellesley College found that three-and-a-
half-year-old girls could interpret facial
expressions as well as or better than five-year-old
boys. Comparing a five-year-old boy to a
five-year-old girl may in some respects be
similar to comparing a three-and-a-half-year-old
girl to a five-year-old girl. The boy will
appear less mature, less self-controlled, less
able to concentrate and focus for sustained
periods of time compared to the girl. There
are no differences between adult men and
women in the ability to concentrate and
focus. But children are not adults. When you
compare the average five-year-old boy to the
average five-year-old girl or the average
11-year-old boy to the average 11-year-old
girl, the boy is likely to score lower on
many parameters. This leads us to another
important point. Sex differences in
childhood are larger and more important than
sex differences in adulthood. By 30 years
of age, both females and males have reached
full maturity of all areas of the brain. When
people over 30 years of age think about their
own experience as adults, they may not see
significant sex differences in how women
and men learn new material or master new
tasks. So, some adults assume that if they're
not seeing big differences in how adult women
and men learn to do new things, then there
probably aren't big sex differences in how
six-year-old girls and boys learn. That
assumption is mistaken.
Acceleration
30 years ago, when kindergarten was all about
finger painting and singing together and
playing duck-duck-goose, sex differences in
brain maturation didn't matter as much. 30
years ago, kindergartners weren't expected to
sit in chairs and do pencil and paper exercises
for much of the day. First graders might have
to do that, but kindergarten was more about
socialization, about learning to get along with
other kids. Not anymore. Today, educators
throughout North America make no apologies
for the academic character of the 21st century
kindergarten. The curriculum of kindergarten
today is essentially the first grade curriculum
of 30 years ago. The primary objective of most
American kindergartens today is simple,
achieving literacy and numeracy. While that
sounds good, there's a problem. Many five-year-old
boys just don't have the patience to sit still
for a 60-minute lesson on diphthongs or the
fine motor skills to write the letters of the
alphabet as neatly as the girls do. In the
jargon of educational psychology, the objectives
of today's academically oriented kindergarten are
not developmentally appropriate for many
kindergarten boys. The unspoken assumption
behind the push to teach reading and writing in
kindergarten is that earlier exposure will guarantee
improved performance. But that assumption is valid only if
what you're teaching is developmentally appropriate for
your students. If you try to teach your seven-year-old kid to
drive a car, you won't end up with a better driver. You may end up
with a smashed fender and an injured child instead. Trying to teach
kids to read before they're really ready to read can
actually boomerang and turn them off to reading. When I share
this with kindergarten teachers, some respond, oh, we understand
that. We understand that not every five-year-old is ready for
reading, not ready for paper and pencil exercises and all that. We
customize what we do to each child's individual needs. That sounds nice, but
what does it really mean in practice? What it actually means sometimes is that
kindergarten is divided in two. Over here with the teacher are the kids who
can handle the academic curriculum of today's accelerated kindergarten. These
kids are sounding out words, writing short sentences, remembering to put a
capital letter at the start of the sentence, and a period at the end. This
group is mostly girls with a few boys. Over there are the kids who aren't ready
to handle the accelerated academic curriculum. Those kids are playing with
blocks or putting together puzzles, activities most of us recognize as
traditional kindergarten activities from our own childhood. A five-year-old boy
may not be very good at fine motor skills, such as writing the letters of the
alphabet, and he may not be developmentally ready to learn about vowels and
consonants. But there's one thing most five-year-old boys are very good at.
Figuring out that they've been put in the dumb group, and they don't like it.
That's what happened to Matthew, the boy whose story opens chapter one.
Before starting kindergarten, Matthew had always been the star, the leading player
in the drama of his life. He was always ready to try anything, his mother told me. Last
July, I suggested to my husband that we paddle a canoe across the Potomac at White's Ferry.
My husband didn't want to, but Matthew did, so we rented a canoe, just me and five-year-old
Matthew, and we had a great time. The rental place gave him this little plastic paddle.
He loved it. He talked about it for days afterward. But now it's different. It's like he's turned
into a completely different kid. He never used to throw temper tantrums before, but he's throwing
a tantrum almost every morning now, for no reason, refusing to get dressed, refusing to
go to school. I have to carry him kicking and screaming into the car and then drag him from
the car into the school. You'd think they were torturing him or doing something horrible.
But they're not. I've sat in on his kindergarten, and there's nothing wrong with it.
The teacher is wonderful, in fact. She's very gentle, very patient. I've talked with
her, and she's reassured me that this is nothing unusual. She keeps saying I shouldn't
worry. But I'm still concerned. Matthew's starting to hate school.
While Matthew's reaction was extreme, many studies now have shown that when the main emphasis
in kindergarten is on learning to read at the expense of other less structured and more
developmentally appropriate activities, many boys tune out and turn off. Those boys develop
negative feelings toward school that are likely to persist and color the child's entire academic
career. Deborah Stipek, who has served more than a decade as dean of the School of Education
at Stanford University, has shown that kids who fail to do well in kindergarten develop negative
perceptions of competence. And those negative attitudes are difficult to reverse as they
progress through school. When Matthew's mother Cindy told me that her son was throwing a tantrum
every morning, I advised her to take him out of kindergarten and put him back in preschool.
Right now. One more month in that kindergarten, and his whole attitude toward school might be
irreparably damaged. Cindy refused. She kept saying, but he's bright. Who's ever heard of a bright child
flunking out of kindergarten? He wasn't flunking out, I told her. This kindergarten was just not
developmentally appropriate for him. Cindy insisted on keeping Matthew in kindergarten.
A month later, she told me that the problem had been solved. Matthew wasn't throwing tantrums anymore.
The teacher said that he was behaving better in class.
One year later, Mom was back with Matthew, now in first grade. This time Cindy had one of those
papers from the school. Matthew is inattentive and easily distracted in class. Would you please
evaluate to determine whether Matthew might meet criteria for ADHD? And, of course, the teacher was
absolutely right about Matthew not paying attention. Matthew was inattentive and easily distracted
in class. He was now firmly convinced that school was just one big bore, an annoyance to be endured
for a few hours each day until that wonderful moment when school let out and he could go home and do all
the fun things he enjoyed. As far as Matthew was concerned, his life really began each day only when
school ended. What's your favorite subject at school? I asked. Recess, he said. What's your next
favorite subject? I asked. Lunch, he said. There are few good choices for parents at this point.
Retention in grade, holding Matthew back a year at the same school, won't solve the problem at this
stage. You've already missed your best chance. There's a big difference between delaying a child's entry to
kindergarten and his repeating first grade a year later. If you delay entry into kindergarten for a
boy like Matthew so he starts at age six, he'll do better than if you start him in kindergarten at age
five. But if you make him start kindergarten when he's not ready for it and then you make him repeat
first grade when the time comes at the same school, he may do worse than if you didn't make him repeat.
The stigmatizing effect of having to repeat a year of school has a long-lasting effect that is not
easily fixed. The boy labels himself as dumb and he believes that label and no amount of talking on
your part will change his mind. In Matthew's case, the best intervention was to enroll him at a different
school in a different neighborhood with a new peer group where he repeated first grade. But none of his
peers knew that he was repeating first grade. He did well. He didn't have ADHD or any other
psychiatric disorder. He just wasn't a good fit for the accelerated tempo of today's elementary education.
Matthew's story is all too common today. As I showed in my book, The Collapse of Parenting,
a child in the United States is now many times more likely to be on medication for ADHD compared with a
child in the United Kingdom. I have to wonder how many of these children, boys especially, are not
paying attention in the classroom because they're trapped in a school that just is not geared to
their needs being taught at a tempo that's out of sync with their brain development.
The Medicalization of Misbehavior
Why are kids in the United States, especially boys, so much more likely to be on medication for ADHD
compared with kids elsewhere? One part of the answer is what I call the medicalization of
misbehavior. Instead of correcting our kids' misbehavior, we American parents today are more
likely to medicate our kids in hopes of fixing the behavior problem with a pill. I'm not saying that
boys are better behaved elsewhere. I have seen plenty of boys in Australia and New Zealand and the UK
who are bouncing and making buzzing noises when they are supposed to be sitting still.
But the teacher does not refer the boy for psychiatric evaluation. Instead, the teacher tells the boy in a
firm voice that she has had quite enough of that silliness, thank you, and that it is high time for it to
stop. Imagine an eight- or ten-year-old boy who misbehaves. He talks back to teachers. He is
deliberately spiteful and vindictive. He doesn't listen. He wants spit at the teacher. He seems to
have little or no self-control. Thirty years ago, even twenty years ago, the school counselor or the
principal might have said to the parent, Your son is disrespectful. He is rude. He exhibits no
self-control. You need to teach him some basic rules about civilized behavior if he is going to stay at
this school. Today, it is much less common for an American school counselor or administrator to speak
so bluntly to a parent. Instead, the counselor or administrator will suggest a consultation with a
physician or a psychologist. And the physician or psychologist will look at the reports from the
school and talk about oppositional defiant disorder or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder or
pediatric bipolar disorder. What's the difference between saying your son is disrespectful and saying
your son may meet criteria for a psychiatric disorder? There's a big difference. When I say
your son is disrespectful, the burden of responsibility is on you, the parent, and on your child. With that
responsibility comes the authority to do something about the problem. But when I say your son may meet
criteria for a psychiatric disorder, then the burden of responsibility shifts away from the parent and
the child to the prescribing physician and indeed to the whole burgeoning medical psychiatric counseling
complex. And the reasonable next question from the parent is not, What should we do to change his
behavior? But rather, Should he begin taking a medication? The medications work. They do change the
child's behavior. That's what I find so scary. These medications are being used in North America as a
means of behavior modification to an extent that is almost unimaginable in other parts of the world.
These are powerful medications. The most popular medications for ADHD are the prescription stimulants
such as Adderall, Vyvanse, Concerta, Metadate, Focalin, Datrana, Ritalin, and Quilivant.
All these medications work in the same way. They increase the action of dopamine at synapses in the
brain. Dopamine is a key neurotransmitter in the nucleus accumbens, the brain's motivational center.
More precisely, the nucleus accumbens is the part of the brain that is responsible for translating
motivation into action. If a boy's nucleus accumbens is damaged, he may feel hungry but isn't likely to
work to prepare a meal for himself. If you damage the nucleus accumbens, the result is likely to be
less motivation, less engagement, less drive to achieve in the real world. Many of the studies
mentioned here are based on research in laboratory animals, not in humans. But researchers have recently
documented that stimulant medications such as Adderall and Vyvanse prescribed for ADHD may actually shrink
the nucleus accumbens and related structures in the human brain. The smaller size of the nucleus
accumbens in people treated with medication for ADHD can't be attributed to ADHD itself because ADHD
itself is associated with a slightly larger than average nucleus accumbens. But after treatment,
the nucleus accumbens is actually smaller than average. It appears then that stimulant medications
for ADHD may shrink the nucleus accumbens in humans. That's especially disturbing in light
of research that documents a nearly linear correlation between the nucleus accumbens and
individual motivation. These studies suggest that the smaller the nucleus accumbens, the more likely
that person is to be apathetic, lacking in drive.
Today, American parents are hungry for brain-based explanations, often overlooking common sense as a
result. Consider the increasingly widespread problem of sleep deprivation in children.
Instead of turning off the video games so their son can get a good night's sleep, many American
parents are medicating their kids with Adderall or Concerta or Vyvanse or Medidate to compensate for the
symptoms of sleep deprivation, such as inattention, often without any awareness that sleep deprivation
is the underlying problem. Instead, the boy's failure to pay attention has been misdiagnosed as ADHD.
Likewise, instead of acknowledging that their son misbehaves, many American parents would prefer that a
doctor diagnose an imbalance in brain chemistry and prescribe Risperdal or Seroquel or Adderall or Concerta.
ADHD is real, but it is overdiagnosed. ADHD is primarily a cognitive disorder. Kids who truly
have ADHD cannot pay attention very well, even if they want to. But often kids are not paying
attention in school not because they can't, but because they don't want to. The question I asked
Matthew, what's your favorite subject at school, is useful in distinguishing the kid who truly has
ADHD from the kid who just hates school? Ask, what's your favorite subject at school? Emphasize the word
subject. If the answer is recess or lunch, take a step back and reassess. This boy knows that recess is
not a subject. If he says that his favorite subject at school is recess, he's telling me that he has no
interest in school. He is disengaged. Maybe he hates school. Hating school is a major problem, but it is
by itself not ADHD or any other psychiatric disorder. The appropriate intervention is not to put the child
on powerful medications, but to understand why the child hates school. Sometimes you will find that the
problem is not in the child at all, but in the school. Other times the problem is that the child has not
been taught proper rules of behavior. Don't give in to the medicalization of misbehavior. Teach your son
that a gentleman does not talk back to teachers, use bad language, spit, bite, kick, or otherwise disrupt
the classroom. Regard medication not as a first resort but as a last resort when all other measures have
been tried and have not worked. Girls are shortchanged too. So far in this chapter I have shared my
experience of the ways in which gender-blind education is harmful to boys, but girls are being
shortchanged as well. Gender-blind education tends to perpetuate gender stereotypes and as a result
fewer girls than boys are really excited about subjects such as physics, computer science, and advanced
math. The long-term results are not good. In 1995, women constituted 37% of professionals working in
computer science. Today, women are just 24% of the computer science workforce, a number that is
forecast to drop to 22% in 2025. In 2015, the latest year for which data are available, 78% of students
who took the AP exam in computer science were boys, and only 22% were girls. When teachers use
girl-friendly instructional strategies for teaching computer science, the results can be dramatic. In
one study, the use of girl-friendly instructional strategies more than tripled the proportion of
sixth-grade girls who wanted to spend their free time working on their computer program from 16% to
51%. Gender-blind instruction disadvantages both girls and boys. I realize that there are factors other than
gender-blind instruction that discourage women from entering computer science, but the fact that girls are a
minority of students studying computer science is certainly a major contributing factor. When I use the phrase
girl-friendly instructional strategies, some people cringe. They think I'm recommending that you bring in bunnies to
teach biology to girls, or that you try to teach physics to girls by talking about relationships. I cringe at that
sort of thing, too. But my girl-friendly strategies are based on what really works in the classroom, not in stereotypes.
When I lead workshops for teachers, I share what I have learned from my visits to more than 400 schools over the
past 16 years. I have found that there is more than one way to teach the content. There are girl-friendly
approaches and there are boy-friendly approaches. You can do both even in the co-ed classroom, but you have to
know what you are doing and how to do it. In my workshops, I go through each of the content areas, math, sciences,
English, creative writing, expository writing, social studies, history, music, and visual arts. And I show how
you can teach a particular content area in a girl-friendly way or in a boy-friendly way. The objective is to
understand both approaches and to engage every student in the classroom, every girl and every boy. Allow me to
give you a concrete example. Number theory for middle school kids. As a rule, I have found that boys are
more interested in number theory for its own sake at a much earlier age than girls are. You can fascinate a
group of 12-year-old boys by getting them to think about transcendental numbers such as phi, pronounced
phi, not to be confused with pi. Here's a good way to introduce phi to 12-year-old boys, which I first
learned about from teachers at Fairfield Country Day School, a boys' school in western Connecticut.
I'm thinking of a number between one and two. The reciprocal of that number is equal to that same
number minus one. Can you tell me what number I'm thinking of? The teacher calls on a boy.
Uh, one and a half, the boy says. The teacher explains, not quite. The reciprocal of one and a half is
two-thirds, and two-thirds does not equal one-half, which is one and a half minus one. She calls on the next
boy. He says, don't you have to write an equation? Excellent, she says. Won't you please come up to the board and
write it? With a little help, he writes the equation, one over x equals x minus one. With a little more
help, another boy figures out that the equation above can be simplified if you multiply both sides
by x, yielding one equals x squared minus x. Subtracting one from both sides equals x squared minus x minus one
equals zero. You can then use the quadratic formula to solve for x. x equals the sum of one plus or minus the
root of five over two. We're looking for a number between one and two, so we choose the positive
solution. Equals the sum of one plus the root of five over two equals zero point five plus one point one
six one eight zero three three nine eight eight seven four nine eight nine equals one point six one
eight zero three three nine eight eight seven four nine eight nine. You can tell the boys that
mathematicians refer to this number as phi. Sure enough, this number phi has the characteristic we
were looking for. The reciprocal of this number exactly equals this number minus one. One divided by
one point six one eight zero three three nine eight eight seven four nine eight nine equals zero point
six one eight zero three three nine eight eight seven four nine eight nine. None of the boys is especially
excited about this, but now you change the subject or appear to change the subject. You tell them about
the Fibonacci series. A Fibonacci series is formed by adding two numbers to yield a third number and
reiterating the process to form a sequence. The simplest Fibonacci sequence is one plus one equals
two. One plus two equals three. Two plus three equals five. Three plus five equals eight. Five plus eight
equals thirteen. Eight plus thirteen equals twenty-one. Thirteen plus twenty-one equals thirty-four. This yields
the series one, one, two, three, five, eight, thirteen, twenty-one, thirty-four, fifty-five, eighty-nine, one-forty-four. Now, ask your boys to take each number in the Fibonacci series and divide it by the number before it, starting with three, and list their answers.
Three divided by two equals one point five. Five divided by three equals one point six six six six.
Eight divided by five equals one point six six six. Eight divided by five equals one point six six seven six six five.
55 divided by 34 equals 1.61764
89 divided by 55 equals 1.61818
144 divided by 89 equals 1.617977
233 divided by 144 equals 1.61805
Now, you can point out to the boys, if they haven't noticed already
that this process seems to be converging on phi
Why is that, you ask them?
While they're thinking about that, you show them a circle with a pentagon inside it
with a triangle inscribed inside the pentagon
Have them look at the triangle
Let them know that the side of the triangle is exactly equal to phi times the length of the base
Why is that?
Why does phi keep popping up where you don't expect it?
You can see an example of this diagram in the PDF that accompanies this audiobook
College women may be just as interested in number theory and transcendental numbers as college men are
As I said earlier, sex differences diminish as a function of age
But if you want 12-year-old girls to be excited about the Fibonacci series
the strategy just presented is not effective
In order to get every 12-year-old girl excited about number theory
you need to connect it with the real world
That's what I have observed in the classroom
At schools where the majority of 12-year-old girls are really excited about number theory
they teach phi and Fibonacci numbers, but they teach them differently
You begin by explaining how the Fibonacci series is formed
1 plus 1 equals 2
1 plus 2 equals 3
2 plus 3 equals 5
3 plus 5 equals 8
5 plus 8 equals 13
8 plus 13 equals 21
13 plus 21 equals 34
and so forth
You write down the first 12 numbers in the Fibonacci series
1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144
In preparation for this session, you've already asked your girls to bring in any of the following
Artichokes, sunflowers, pineapples, pinecones, delphiniums, black-eyed susans, shasta daisies, and field daisies
Start with the flowers
Teachers have explained to me that they start with flowers not because flowers are feminine
but because it's easier to count the number of petals on a daisy than it is to count the rows of bracts on a pinecone
Count the number of petals
You'll find that the number of petals is almost always a number in the Fibonacci series
8 petals for delphiniums
13 for delphiniums
21 for black-eyed susans
34 for field daisies
Then you can move on to the artichokes, sunflowers, pinecones, and pineapples
These are more complicated
In these, you're studying the number of rows or bracts rather than the number of petals
The number of rows counted vertically or obliquely will, again, be a number in the Fibonacci series
You can get more examples like these from the book Fascinating Fibonaccis by Trudy Hamill Garland
Older girls may enjoy The Golden Ratio, The Story of Phi, The World's Most Astonishing Number by Mario Livio
Or you might even let them read Dan Brown's novel The Da Vinci Code
and challenge them to verify or invalidate each of the many claims made in that book about Phi and the Fibonacci series
Show them examples of natural phenomena that manifest Phi, such as a dying leaf or a spiral nebula
At this point, you might also mention the fact that Phi minus one equals one over Phi
But don't expect the girls to ooh and ah over that fact the way the boys do
Twelve-year-old girls are likely to be more interested in the real-world applications of number theory than in remote abstractions
The girls are also more likely to be interested in the beliefs of the ancient Pythagoreans
regarding the magical and mystical properties of Phi
Now these girls will start asking questions
Why do numbers in the Fibonacci series keep showing up when you count the petals on a delphinium or the bracts on a pinecone?
Why is it that a dying poinsettia leaf and a spiral nebula both manifest Phi?
How can abstract number theory explain these similarities?
And you will have accomplished something that is rare in North American classrooms
You've got twelve-year-old girls excited about number theory
I like this example because it illustrates an important point
There are few differences in what girls and boys can learn
But there are big differences in the best ways to teach them
At the end of the day, you will have taught both girls and boys about the properties of Phi
using the Fibonacci series as an introduction to number theory
But if you teach that material the way it's often taught
the way we taught it to the boys in my example above
then many of the girls will tune out and be bored
When is an A not an A?
Remember Melanie, the gifted student who wanted to take physics her senior year?
One of the things about Melanie that always impresses me
is her willingness to try something new
She is supremely self-confident
In that respect, Melanie is, unfortunately, not your typical girl
Beth is another girl I know
Beth is every bit as smart as Melanie
but she doesn't have Melanie's self-confidence
Like Melanie, Beth aced biology
and was a favorite student of Ms. Griffith
But when Ms. Griffith suggested that Beth sign up for physics
Beth hesitated
I just don't think I'm smart enough for physics
Beth said
I've never done anything like that
and I don't want to risk getting a B or worse on my transcript
She ended up taking up psychology in her senior year instead of physics
Girls on average outperform boys in school
as measured by report card grades
in most subjects and in all age groups
and those differences are widening
Because girls do better in school
one might imagine that girls would be more self-confident about their academic abilities
and that they would have higher academic self-esteem
But that's not the case
Paradoxically, girls are more likely to be excessively critical
in evaluating their own academic performance
Conversely, boys tend to have unrealistically high estimates
of their own academic abilities and accomplishments
Those are some of the paradoxes teachers face
The girl like Beth who gets straight A's
but has no real confidence in her own abilities
The boy who's getting B's and C's
but thinks he's brilliant
That leads us to a basic difference in teaching style
for girls versus boys
Many girls need encouragement
Some boys, on the other hand, need a reality check
a reminder that they're not as accomplished as they think they are
A blunder at Harvard
Gender differences made the headlines
right around the time that the first edition of
Why Gender Matters was published
owing to some unwise remarks made by the man
who was then president of Harvard University
Larry Summers
On January 14, 2005
Dr. Summers offered several reasons
why there are so few women professors
in subjects like computer science and physics
President Summers began by acknowledging
that sexism probably plays some role
but he did not consider sexism to be a major factor
Second, he asserted that women make
different lifestyle choices than men do
In particular, according to Dr. Summers
women with small children at home
might be less willing to put in long hours at work
than men are
If he had just stopped there
he might not have gotten into too much trouble
But Dr. Summers went on to say
that a third factor must be at work
specifically with regard to subjects
like computer science and physics
The third factor, the esteemed professor said
has to do with innate differences in
intrinsic aptitude
In other words, according to the president
of Harvard University
women just don't have the brains
to excel in physics
When the president of Harvard University
says that women are innately less capable in science
a firestorm is sure to erupt
On the conservative end of the spectrum
commentators such as Linda Chavez and Kathy Young
sprang to Summers' defense
They suggested that because little boys
prefer to play with trucks rather than dolls
boys are destined to be better at physics
They also invoked the idea
that boys are more variable than girls
Just as mental retardation is more common
among boys than among girls
so too is genius more common
among boys than among girls
according to these commentators
At the other end of the spectrum
the majority of the Harvard faculty
of arts and sciences
rose in anger to denounce their president
One Harvard physics professor said
it was crazy to suggest
that there are any hardwired differences
of any significance between girls and boys
On March 15, 2005
the faculty voted no confidence
in Summers' leadership
In fact, both sides of this debate
got it wrong
The outraged liberals
were demonstrably wrong on the facts
when they asserted that there are no
important hardwired differences
between girls and boys
If you don't agree
please re-listen to chapter 2 of this book
But Dr. Summers was wrong
to suggest that differences
imply an order of rank
A knife is different from a spoon
That doesn't mean that a knife
is better or worse than a spoon
Girls and boys are different
That doesn't mean that boys
are necessarily destined
to be better physicists
unless physics is taught
in a way that gives boys
an advantage at the expense of girls
In my book, Girls on the Edge
I shared some of what I learned
from two visits to Carawa
a girls' school in Melbourne, Australia
At Carawa, more than half the girls
take the Australian equivalent
of advanced placement physics
That's an extraordinary achievement
How do they do it?
They teach physics differently
At most high schools
physics instruction begins
with that part of physics
called kinematics
Velocity, acceleration
and Newton's laws of motion
That means you're talking
about race cars accelerating
or soccer players colliding
On both my visits to Carawa
I met with Jen Alabaster
the lead physics instructor
at the school
Where is it written
that physics instruction
has to begin with kinematics?
She said to me
That's not where she starts
the school year
She begins with
the wave-particle duality of light
The fact that light
sometimes behaves like a wave
and sometimes like a particle
depending on how you test it
She has found that
almost every girl
is fascinated
by the wave-particle duality of light
including the girly girl
who has a photo of Kylie Jenner
as the screensaver on her phone
Of course, Ms. Alabaster
teaches kinematics
but she teaches it
toward the end of the school year
In most other schools
I have visited
AP physics begins
with kinematics
and the wave-particle duality
of light is pushed back
into the final weeks
of the school year
just before the AP test
So, one aspect
of girl-friendly physics
may be as simple
as the sequence
in which the various
curriculum items are taught
Beginning the school year
with the wave-particle duality
of light
is a more girl-friendly approach
than starting with kinematics
and momentum transfer
It's not better
It's not worse
It's just different
Most schools teach physics
using the boy-friendly
sequence of topics
starting with football players
colliding
and bombs exploding
Then they wonder
why more girls
don't want to take the class
Girls may not sign up
because they may not know
how fascinating physics
can be
once you get past
the collisions
and the explosions
If you're not aware
of something
that at some point
might interest you
how can you choose it?
Asks Karen Peterson
the principal investigator
for a National Science Foundation
funded project
that seeks to understand
why girls and women
are still underrepresented
in subjects like physics
I don't think you have to have
an all-girls classroom
in order to engage girls
in physics
although it might help
But you definitely need
a teacher who understands
and respects the differences
between girl-friendly instruction
and boy-friendly instruction
If you recall
what we discussed
in Chapter 2
about sex differences
in the visual system
how the boy's system
is more geared
for objects in motion
and the girl's system
is more geared
for color and detail
then these sex differences
in instructional strategies
start to make sense
in a larger context
Some of what we're discovering
regarding girl-friendly instruction
may not be discovering
so much as rediscovering
Historian Kim Tolley
has shown that
throughout the 1800s
girls routinely outperformed boys
in subjects like physics
and astronomy
During the same era
boys outperformed girls
in foreign languages
especially Greek and Latin
The differences in performance
were enormous
Girls routinely outscored the boys
by wide margins
70% of girls passing
compared with only 30% of boys
when girls and boys
took the same physics exam
These differences were seen
throughout the United States
in all social strata
from elite private schools
to schools for orphans
and Native Americans
The differences in performance
were so universal
favoring girls in science
and boys in classical languages
that educators in the 1800s
had a saying
Science for the ladies
Classics for gentlemen
What was going on?
As for the boys
they may have done better
than girls
at learning Greek and Latin
in that era
for several reasons
First
the most popular
ancient Greek and Latin texts
that were taught
such as Homer's Iliad
and Virgil's Aeneid
are texts
whose main characters
are men
engaging in
stereotypical
masculine activities
such as fighting
and risk-taking
Second
the instructional strategies
employed in that era
such as rote learning
may be more boy-friendly
than girl-friendly
Third
there seems to have been
widespread acceptance
of the stereotype
that
girls can't learn Greek
Proficiency in Greek
and Latin
was a requirement
for entry to the top colleges
such as the Ivy League
which accepted only men
Women's colleges
in that era
did not require knowledge
of Greek or Latin
as a condition for admission
and
why did girls
in that era
outperform the boys
in subjects
such as physics
and astronomy
One part of the answer
is that subjects
such as physics
and astronomy
were taught
very differently
in the 1800s
even when the actual facts
such as force diagrams
and Newton's laws
were the same then
as they are today
In the 1800s
the emphasis was on
understanding
the big picture
how is the universe
put together
what laws
govern the movement
of objects
in space
and on earth
Learning physics
was considered
to be a way
of understanding
the mind of God
and therefore
was seen
as a pious activity
suitable for young women
In the early 1800s
physics was often
referred to as
natural theology
One textbook
from that era
shows an engraving
of
