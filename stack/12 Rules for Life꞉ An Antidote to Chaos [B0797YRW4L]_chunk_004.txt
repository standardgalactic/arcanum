by the snake, the first couple ate from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, discovered death
and vulnerability, and turned away from God. Mankind was exiled from paradise and began its
effortful mortal existence. The idea of sacrifice enters soon afterwards, beginning with the account
of Cain and Abel, and developing through the Abrahamic adventures and the Exodus.
After much contemplation, struggling humanity learns that God's favor could be gained,
and his wrath averted, through proper sacrifice, and also that bloody murder might be motivated
among those unwilling or unable to succeed in this manner.
The Delay of Gratification
When engaging in sacrifice, our forefathers began to act out what would be considered a proposition
if it were stated in words, that something better might be attained in the future by giving up
something of value in the present. Recall, if you will, that the necessity for work is one of the
curses placed by God upon Adam and his descendants in consequence of original sin. Adam's waking to
the fundamental constraints of his being, his vulnerability, his eventual death, is equivalent
to his discovery of the future. The future. That's where you go to die. Hopefully not too soon.
Your demise might be staved off through work, through the sacrifice of the now, to gain benefit later.
It is for this reason, among others, no doubt, that the concept of sacrifice is introduced in the
biblical chapter, immediately following the drama of the fall.
There's little difference between sacrifice and work.
They are also both uniquely human.
Sometimes, animals act as if they are working,
but they are really only following the dictates of their nature.
Beavers build dams.
They do so because they are beavers.
Beavers build dams.
They don't think,
yeah, but I'd rather be on a beach in Mexico with my girlfriend while they're doing it.
Prosaically, such sacrifice, work, is delay of gratification.
But that's a very mundane phrase to describe something of such profound significance.
The discovery that gratification could be delayed was simultaneously the discovery of time
and, with it, causality, at least the causal force of voluntary human action.
Long ago, in the dim mists of time,
we began to realize that reality was structured as if it could be bargained with.
We learned that behaving properly now, in the present,
regulating our impulses, considering the plight of others,
could bring rewards in the future, in a time and place that did not yet exist.
We began to inhibit, control, and organize our immediate impulses
so that we could stop interfering with other people and our future selves.
Doing so was indistinguishable from organizing society.
The discovery of the causal relationship between our efforts today
and the quality of tomorrow motivated the social contract,
the organization that enables today's work to be stored reliably,
mostly in the form of promises from others.
Understanding is often acted out before it can be articulated,
just as a child acts out what it means to be mother or father
before being able to give a spoken account of what those roles mean.
The act of making a ritual sacrifice to God
was an early and sophisticated enactment of the idea of the usefulness of delay.
There is a long conceptual journey between merely feasting hungrily
and learning to set aside some extra meat smoked by the fire for the end of the day
or for someone who isn't present.
It takes a long time to learn to keep anything later for yourself
or to share it with someone else.
And those are very much the same thing
as, in the former case, you are sharing with your future self.
It is much easier and far more likely
to selfishly and immediately wolf down everything in sight.
There are similar long journeys between every leap in sophistication
with regard to delay and its conceptualization.
Short-term sharing, storing away for the future,
representation of that storage in the form of records
and later in the form of currency,
and ultimately the saving of money in a bank or other social institution.
Some conceptualizations had to serve as intermediaries
or the full range of our practices and ideas
surrounding sacrifice and work and their representation
could have never emerged.
Our ancestors acted out a drama, a fiction.
They personified the force that governs fate
as a spirit that can be bargained with, traded with,
as if it were another human being.
And the amazing thing is that it worked.
This was in part because the future is largely composed of other human beings,
often precisely those who have watched and evaluated
and appraised the tiniest details of your past behavior.
It's not very far from that to God,
sitting above on high, tracking your every move,
and writing it down for further reference in a big book.
Here's a productive, symbolic idea.
The future is a judgmental father.
That's a good start.
But two additional archetypal foundational questions arose
because of the discovery of sacrifice, of work.
Both have to do with the ultimate extension of the logic of work,
which is sacrifice now to gain later.
First question.
What must be sacrificed?
Small sacrifices may be sufficient to solve small, singular problems.
But it is possible that larger, more comprehensive sacrifices
might solve an array of large and complex problems
all at the same time.
That's harder, but it might be better.
Adapting to the necessary discipline of medical school will, for example,
fatally interfere with the licentious lifestyle
of a hardcore undergraduate party animal.
Giving that up is a sacrifice.
But a physician can, to paraphrase George W.,
really put food on his family.
That's a lot of trouble dispensed with over a very long period of time.
So, sacrifices are necessary to improve the future.
And larger sacrifices can be better.
Second question.
Set of related questions, really.
We've already established the basic principle.
Sacrifice will improve the future.
But a principle, once established, has to be fleshed out.
Its full extension or significance has to be understood.
What is implied by the idea that sacrifice will improve the future,
in the most extreme and final of cases?
Where does that basic principle find its limits?
We must ask, to begin,
what would be the largest, most effective, most pleasing of all possible sacrifices?
And then, how good might the best possible future be
if the most effective sacrifice could be made?
The biblical story of Cain and Abel, Adam and Eve's sons,
immediately follows the story of the expulsion from paradise,
as mentioned previously.
Cain and Abel are really the first humans,
since their parents were made directly by God
and not born in the standard manner.
Cain and Abel live in history, not in Eden.
They must work.
They must make sacrifices to please God,
and they do so, with altar and proper ritual.
But things get complicated.
Abel's offerings please God, but Cain's do not.
Abel is rewarded many times over, but Cain is not.
It's not precisely clear why,
although the text strongly hints that Cain's heart is just not in it.
Maybe the quality of what Cain put forward was low.
Maybe his spirit was begrudging.
Or maybe God was vexed for some secret reasons of his own.
And all of this is realistic,
including the text's vagueness of explanation.
Not all sacrifices are of equal quality.
Furthermore, it often appears that sacrifices of apparently high quality
are not rewarded with a better future.
And it's not clear why.
Why isn't God happy?
What would have to change to make him so?
Those are difficult questions, and everyone asks them all the time,
even if they don't notice.
Asking such questions is indistinguishable from thinking.
The realization that pleasure could be usefully forestalled
dawned on us with great difficulty.
It runs absolutely contrary to our ancient fundamental animal instincts,
which demand immediate satisfaction,
particularly under conditions of deprivation,
which are both inevitable and commonplace.
And, to complicate the matter,
such delay only becomes useful
when civilization has stabilized itself enough
to guarantee the existence of the delayed reward in the future.
If everything you save will be destroyed,
or worse, stolen,
there is no point in saving.
It is for this reason
that a wolf will down 20 pounds of raw meat in a single meal.
He isn't thinking,
Man, I hate it when I binge.
I should save some of this for next week.
So how was it that those two impossible
and necessarily simultaneous accomplishments,
delay in the stabilization of society into the future,
could possibly have manifested themselves?
Here is a developmental progression
from animal to human.
It's wrong, no doubt, in the details,
but it's sufficiently correct for our purposes in theme.
First, there is excess food.
Large carcasses, mammoths,
or other massive herbivores might provide that.
We ate a lot of mammoths.
Maybe all of them.
After a kill with a large animal,
there's some left for later.
That's accidental at first.
But eventually,
the utility of for later
starts to be appreciated.
Some provisional notion of sacrifice
develops at the same time.
If I leave some,
even if I want it now,
I won't have to be hungry later.
That provisional notion
develops to the next level.
If I leave some for later,
I won't have to go hungry,
and neither will those I care for.
And then to the next,
I can't possibly eat all of this mammoth,
but I can't store the rest for too long either.
Maybe I should feed some to other people.
Maybe they'll remember
and feed me some of their mammoth
when they have some,
and I have none.
Then I'll get some mammoth now,
and some mammoth later.
That's a good deal.
And maybe those I'm sharing with
will come to trust me more generally.
Maybe then we could trade forever.
In such a manner,
mammoth becomes future mammoth,
and future mammoth
becomes personal reputation.
That's the emergence of the social contract.
To share does not mean
to give away something you value
and get nothing back.
That is, instead,
only what every child who refuses to share
fears it means.
To share means, properly,
to initiate the process of trade.
A child who can't share,
who can't trade,
can't have any friends,
because having friends is a form of trade.
Benjamin Franklin once suggested
that a newcomer to a neighborhood
ask a new neighbor
to do him or her a favor,
citing an old maxim.
He that has once done you a kindness
will be more ready to do you another
than he whom you yourself have obliged.
In Franklin's opinion,
asking someone for something,
not too extreme, obviously,
was the most useful
and immediate invitation
to social interaction.
Such asking on the part of the newcomer
provided the neighbor
with an opportunity
to show him or herself
as a good person
at first encounter.
It also meant that the latter
could now ask the former
for a favor in return
because of the debt incurred,
increasing their mutual familiarity
and trust.
In that manner,
both parties could overcome
their natural hesitancy
and mutual fear of the stranger.
It is better to have something
than nothing.
It's better yet
to share generously
the something you have.
It's even better than that,
however,
to become widely known
for generous sharing.
That's something that lasts.
That's something that's reliable.
And, at this point of abstraction,
we can observe
how the groundwork
for the conceptions
reliable,
honest,
and generous
has been laid.
The basis
for an articulated morality
has been put in place.
The productive,
truthful sharer
is the prototype
for the good citizen
and the good man.
We can see in this manner
how from the simple notion
that leftovers
are a good idea,
the highest moral principles
might emerge.
It's as if
something like the following
happened
as humanity developed.
First were the endless
tens or hundreds
of thousands of years
prior to the emergence
of written history
and drama.
During this time,
the twin practices
of delay and exchange
begin to emerge
slowly and painfully.
Then they become represented
in metaphorical abstraction
as rituals
and tales of sacrifice,
told in a manner
such as this.
It's as if
there's a powerful
figure in the sky
who sees all
and is judging you.
Giving up something
you value
seems to make them happy
and you want to make them happy
because all hell
breaks loose
if you don't.
So,
practice sacrificing
and sharing
until you become
expert at it
and things will go
well for you.
No one said
any of this,
at least not so
plainly and direct,
but it was implicit
in the practice
and then in the stories.
Action came first
as it had to
as the animals
we once were
could act
but could not think.
Implicit,
unrecognized value
came first
as the actions
that preceded thought
embodied value
but did not make
that value explicit.
People watched
the successful succeed
and the unsuccessful
fail for thousands
and thousands
of years.
We thought it over
and drew a conclusion.
The successful
among us
delay gratification.
The successful
among us
bargain with the future.
a great idea
begins to emerge
taking ever more
clearly articulated
form
in ever more
clearly articulated
stories.
What's the difference
between the successful
and the unsuccessful?
The successful
sacrifice.
Things get better
as the successful
practice their sacrifices.
The questions
become increasingly
precise
and simultaneously
broader.
what is the greatest
possible sacrifice
for the greatest
possible good?
And the answers
become increasingly
deeper and profound.
The God
of Western tradition
like so many
gods
requires sacrifice.
We have already
examined why
but sometimes
he goes even
further.
He demands
not only sacrifice
but the sacrifice
of precisely
what is loved
best.
This is most
starkly portrayed
and most
confusingly evident
in the story
of Abraham
and Isaac.
Abraham
beloved of God
long wanted a son
and God
promised him
exactly that
after many delays
and under the
apparently impossible
conditions of old age
and a long
barren wife.
But not so long
afterward
when the miraculously
born Isaac
is still a child
God turns around
and in unreasonable
and apparently
barbaric fashion
demands that his
faithful servant
offer his son
as a sacrifice.
The story ends
happily.
God sends an angel
to stay Abraham's
obedient hand
and accepts a ram
in Isaac's stead.
That's a good thing
but it doesn't really
address the issue
at hand.
Why is God's
going further
necessary?
Why does he
why does life
impose
such demands?
We'll start
our analysis
with a truism
stark
self-evident
and understated.
Sometimes
things do not
go well.
That seems
to have much
to do with
the terrible
nature of the
world
with its
plagues
and famines
and tyrannies
and betrayals.
But here's
the rub.
Sometimes
when things
are not going
well
it's not
the world
that's the
cause.
The cause
is instead
that which
is currently
most valued
subjectively
and personally.
Why?
Because the
world is
revealed to
an indeterminate
degree through
the template
of your
values.
Much more
on this
in Rule
10.
If the
world you
are seeing
is not
the world
you want
therefore
it's time
to examine
your values.
It's time
to rid
yourself
of your
current
presuppositions.
It's time
to let go.
It might
even be
time to
sacrifice
what you
love best
so that
you can
become
who you
might
become
instead
of
staying
who
you
are.
There's
an old
and possibly
apocryphal
story about
how to
catch a
monkey
that
illustrates
this set
of ideas
very well.
First
you must
find a
large
narrow-necked
jar
just barely
wide enough
in diameter
at the
top
for a
monkey
to put
its
hand
inside.
Then
you must
fill
the jar
partway
with rocks
so it
is too
heavy
for a
monkey
to
carry.
Then
you must
scatter
some
treats
attractive
to
monkeys
near
the
jar
to
attract
one.
Put some
more
inside
the jar.
A monkey
will come
along,
reach into
the narrow
opening,
and grab
while the
grabbing's
good.
But now
he won't
be able
to extract
his fist,
now full
of treats,
from the
too narrow
opening
of the
jar.
Not
without
unclenching
his hand.
Not
without relinquishing
what he
already
has,
and that's
just what
he won't
do.
The monkey
catcher can
just walk
over to
the jar
and pick
up the
monkey.
The animal
will not
sacrifice the
part to
preserve the
whole.
Something
valuable,
given up,
ensures future
prosperity.
Something
valuable,
sacrificed,
pleases the
Lord.
What is
most valuable
and best
sacrificed?
Or what
is at
least
emblematic
of that?
A choice
cut of
meat,
the best
animal in
a flock,
a most
valued
possession.
What's
above even
that?
Something
intensely
personal
and painful
to give
up.
That's
symbolized,
perhaps,
in God's
insistence
on circumcision
as part of
Abraham's
sacrificial
routine,
where the
part is
offered,
symbolically,
to redeem
the whole.
What's
beyond that?
What
pertains
more
closely
to the
whole
person
rather
than
the
part?
What
constitutes
the
ultimate
sacrifice
for the
gain
of the
ultimate
prize?
It's
a close
race
between
child
and
self.
The
sacrifice
of the
mother
offering
her
child
to
the
world
is
exemplified
profoundly
by
Michelangelo's
great
sculpture,
the
Pieta.
Michelangelo
crafted
Mary
contemplating
her
son,
crucified
and
ruined.
It's
her
fault.
It was
through
her that
he
entered
the
world
and
its
great
drama
of
being.
Is
it
right
to
bring
a
baby
into
this
terrible
world?
Every
woman
asks
herself
that
question.
Some
say
no
and
they
have
their
reasons.
Mary
answers
yes
voluntarily
knowing
full
well
what's
to
come
as
do
all
mothers
if
they
allow
themselves
to
see.
It's
an
act
of
supreme
courage
when
undertaken
voluntarily.
In
turn,
Mary's
son,
Christ,
offers
himself
to
God
and
the
world
to
betrayal,
torture,
and
death,
to
the
very
point
of
despair
on
the
cross
where
he
cries
out
those
terrible
words,
My
God,
my
God,
why
hast
thou
forsaken
me?
Matthew
27
46.
That
is the
archetypal
story of
the man
who gives
his all
for the
sake
of the
better,
who
offers
up
his
life
for
the
advancement
of
being,
who
allows
God's
will
to
become
manifest
fully
within
the
confines
of
a
single
mortal
life.
That
is
the
model
for
the
honorable
man.
In
Christ's
case,
however,
as
he
sacrifices
himself,
God,
his
father,
is
simultaneously
sacrificing
his
son.
It
is for
this
reason
that
the
Christian
sacrificial
drama
of
son
and
self
is
archetypal.
It's
a story
at the
limit
where
nothing
more
extreme,
nothing
greater
can be
imagined.
That's
the
very
definition
of
archetypal.
That's
the
core
of
what
constitutes
religious.
Pain
and
suffering
define
the
world.
Of
that
there
can
be
no
doubt.
Sacrifice
can hold
pain
and
suffering
in
abeyance
to a
greater
or
lesser
degree,
and
greater
sacrifices
can
do
that
more
effectively
than
lesser.
Of
that
there
can
be
no
doubt.
Everyone
holds
this
knowledge
in
their
soul.
Thus,
the
person
who
wishes
to
alleviate
suffering,
who
wishes
to
rectify
the
flaws
in
being,
who
wants
to
bring
about
the
best
of
all
possible
futures,
who
wants
to
create
heaven
on
earth,
will
make
the
greatest
of
sacrifices,
of
self
and
child,
of
everything
that
is
loved,
to
live
a
life
aimed
at
the
good.
He
will
forego
expediency.
He
will
pursue
the
path
of
ultimate
meaning,
and
he
will
in
that
manner
bring
salvation
to
the
ever
desperate
world.
But
is such
a thing
even
possible?
Is
this
simply
not
asking
too
much
of
the
individual?
It's
all
well
and
good
for
Christ,
it
might
be
objected,
but
he
was
the
veritable
son
of
God.
But
we
do
have
other
examples,
some
much
less
mythologized
and
archetypal.
Consider,
for example,
the case
of
Socrates,
the
ancient
Greek
philosopher.
After
a
lifetime
of
seeking
the
truth
and
educating
his
countrymen,
Socrates
faced
a trial
for
crimes
against
the
city-state
of
Athens,
his
hometown.
His
accusers
provided
him
with
plenty
of
opportunity
to
simply
leave
and
avoid
the
trouble.
But
the
great
sage
had
already
considered
and
rejected
this
course
of
action.
His
companion
Hermogenes
observed
him at
this
time
discussing
any
and
every
subject
other
than
his
trial
and
asked
him
why
he
appeared
so
unconcerned.
Socrates
first answered
that he had been
preparing
his whole
life to
defend
himself,
but then
said something
more mysterious
more mysterious
and significant.
When he
attempted
specifically
to consider
strategies
that would
produce
acquittal
by fair
means
or foul,
or even
when merely
considering
his potential
actions
at the
trial,
he found
himself
interrupted
by his
divine
sign,
his
internal
spirit,
voice,
or demon.
Socrates
discussed
this voice
at the
trial
itself.
He said
that one
of the
factors
distinguishing
him
from other
men was
his absolute
willingness
to listen
to its
warnings,
to stop
speaking
and cease
acting
when it
objected.
The gods
themselves
had deemed
him wise
above other
men,
not least
for this
reason,
according to
the Delphic
oracle
herself,
held to
be a
reliable
judge
of such
things.
Because
his ever
reliable
internal
voice
objected
to fleeing
or even
to defending
himself,
Socrates
radically
altered
his view
of the
significance
of his
trial.
He began
to consider
that it
might be
a blessing
rather than
a curse.
He told
Hermogenes
of his
realization
that the
spirit to
whom he
had always
listened
might be
offering him
a way
out of
life
in a
manner
easiest
but also
the least
irksome
to one's
friends,
with sound
body and
a spirit
capable of
showing
kindliness,
and absent
the throes
of illness
and vexations
of extreme
old age.
Socrates'
decision to
accept his
fate allowed
him to put
away mortal
terror in
the face
of death
itself,
prior to
and during
the trial,
after the
sentence was
handed down,
and even
later,
during his
execution.
He saw
that his
life had
been so
rich and
full that
he could
let it
go,
gracefully.
He was
given the
opportunity to
put his
affairs in
order.
He saw
that he
could escape
the terrible
slow
degeneration
of the
advancing
years.
He came
to understand
all that
was happening
to him
as a gift
from the
gods.
He was
not therefore
required to
defend himself
against his
accusers,
at least not
with the aim
of pronouncing
his innocence
and escaping
his fate.
Instead,
he turned
the tables,
addressing his
judges in a
manner that
makes the
reader understand
precisely why
the town
council wanted
this man
dead.
Then he
took his
poison like
a man.
Socrates
rejected
expediency
and the
necessity for
manipulation
that accompanied
it.
He chose
instead under
the direst
of conditions
to maintain
his pursuit
of the
meaningful
and the
true.
Twenty-five
hundred years
later,
we remember
his decision
and take
comfort from
it.
What can we
learn from
this?
If you
cease to
utter
falsehoods
and live
according to
the dictates
of your
conscience,
you can
maintain
your
nobility
even when
facing the
ultimate
threat.
If you
abide
truthfully
and courageously
by the
highest of
ideals,
you will
be provided
with more
security and
strength than
will be
offered by
any
short-sighted
concentration
on your
own safety.
If you
live
properly,
fully,
you can
discover meaning
so profound
that it
protects you
even from
the fear
of death,
could all
that possibly
be true?
Death,
toil,
and evil.
The tragedy
of self-conscious
being produces
suffering,
inevitable
suffering.
That suffering,
in turn,
motivates the
desire for
selfish,
immediate
gratification,
for expediency.
But sacrifice
and work serves
far more
effectively than
short-term
impulsive
pleasure at
keeping
suffering at
bay.
However,
tragedy itself,
conceived of
as the
arbitrary
harshness of
society and
nature set
against the
vulnerability
of the
individual,
is not
the only,
and perhaps
not even
the primary
source of
suffering.
There is
also the
problem of
evil to
consider.
The world
is set hard
against us,
of a
certainty,
but man's
inhumanity to
man is
something even
worse.
Thus,
the problem
of sacrifice
is compounded
in its
complexity.
It is not
only privation
and mortal
limitation that
must be
addressed by
work,
by the
willingness to
offer and
to give up.
It is the
problem of
evil as
well.
Consider
once again
the story
of Adam
and Eve.
Life
becomes very
hard for
their children,
that's us,
after the
fall and
awakening of
our
archetypal
parents.
First is
the terrible
fate awaiting
us in the
post-paradisal
world,
in the
world of
history.
Not the
least of
this is
what Goethe
called our
creative
endless
toil.
Humans
work,
as we
have seen.
We work
because we
have awakened
to the
truth of
our own
vulnerability,
our
subjugation
to disease
and death,
and wish
to protect
ourselves
for as
long as
possible.
Once we
can see
the future,
we must
prepare for
it,
or live
in denial
and terror.
We
therefore
sacrifice
the pleasures
of today
for the
sake of
a better
tomorrow.
But the
realization
of mortality
and the
necessity
of work
is not
the only
revelation
to Adam
and Eve
when they
eat the
forbidden
fruit,
wake up,
and open
their eyes.
They were
also granted
or cursed
by the
knowledge of
good and
evil.
It took
me decades
to understand
what that
means,
to understand
even part
of what
that means.
It's
this,
once you
become
consciously
aware that
you,
yourself,
are
vulnerable,
you
understand
the nature
of human
vulnerability
in general.
You
understand
what it's
like to
be fearful
and angry
and resentful
and bitter.
You
understand
what pain
means.
And once
you truly
understand
such feelings
in yourself,
and how
they're
produced,
you understand
how to produce
them in others.
It is in this
manner that the
self-conscious
beings that we
are become
voluntarily and
exquisitely capable
of tormenting
others,
and ourselves,
of course,
but it's the
others we are
concerned about
right now.
We see the
consequences of
this new
knowledge manifest
themselves when
we meet Cain
and Abel,
the sons of
Adam and Eve.
By the
time of
their
appearance,
mankind
has learned
to make
sacrifices
to God.
On
altars of
stone
designed for
that purpose,
a communal
ritual is
performed,
the immolation
of something
valuable,
a choice
animal or
portion
thereof,
and its
transformation
through fire
to the
smoke,
to the
spirit,
that rises
to heaven
above.
In this
manner,
the idea
of delay
is dramatized
so that
the future
might improve.
Abel's
sacrifices
are accepted
by God
and he
flourishes.
Cain's,
however,
are rejected.
He becomes
jealous and
bitter and
it's no
wonder.
If someone
fails and
is rejected
because he
refused to
make any
sacrifices at
all,
well,
that's at
least
understandable.
He may
still feel
resentful and
vengeful,
but knows
in his
heart that
he is
personally
to blame.
That
knowledge
generally
places a
limit on
his
outrage.
It's
much
worse,
however,
if he
had
actually
forgone
the
pleasures
of the
moment,
if he
had
strived
and
toiled
and
things
still
didn't
work
out,
if he
was
rejected
despite
his
efforts.
Then
he's
lost
the
present
and
the
future.
Then
his
work,
his
sacrifice,
has
been
pointless.
Under
such
conditions
the
world
darkens
and
the
soul
rebels.
Cain
is
outraged
by his
rejection.
He
confronts
God,
accuses
him,
curses
his
creation.
That
proves to
be a
very
poor
decision.
God
responds
in no
uncertain
terms
that the
fault is
all with
Cain,
and worse,
that Cain
has
knowingly
and creatively
dallied
with sin
and reaped
the
consequences.
This
is
not
at
all
what
Cain
wanted
to
hear.
It's
by no
means
an
apology
on
God's
part.
Instead,
it's
insult
added
to
injury.
Cain,
embittered
to the
core
by God's
response,
plots
revenge.
He
defies
the
creator
audaciously.
It's
daring.
Cain
knows how
to
hurt.
He's
self-conscious,
after all,
and has
become
even
more
so
in
his
suffering
and
shame.
So he
murders
Abel
in
cold
blood.
He
kills
his
brother.
His
own
ideal,
as
Abel
is
everything
Cain
wishes
to
be.
He
commits
this
most
terrible
of
crimes
to
spite
himself,
all
of
mankind,
and
God
himself
all
at
once.
He
does
it
to
wreak
havoc
and
gain
his
vengeance.
He
does
it
to
register
his
fundamental
opposition
to
existence,
to
protest
the
intolerable
vagaries
of
being
itself.
And
Cain's
children,
the
offspring,
as it
were,
of both
his
body
and
his
decision,
are
worse.
In
his
existential
fury,
Cain
kills
once.
Lamech,
his
descendant,
goes
much
further.
I
have
slain
a
man
to
my
wounding,
says
Lamech,
and
a
young
man
to
my
hurt.
If
Cain
shall
be
avenged
sevenfold,
truly
Lamech,
seventy
and
sevenfold.
Genesis
4,
23-24.
Tubalcain,
an
instructor of
every
artificer in
brass and
iron,
Genesis
4,
22,
is by
tradition
seven
generations
from
Cain,
and the
first creator
of weapons
of war.
And
next in the
Genesis stories
comes the
flood.
The
juxtaposition
is by
no means
accidental.
Evil
enters the
world
with
self-consciousness.
The toil
with which
God
curses
Adam,
that's
bad
enough.
The
trouble
in
childbirth
with which
Eve is
burdened
and her
consequent
dependence
on her
husband
are no
trivial
matters
either.
They
are
indicative
of the
implicit
and
oft
agonizing
tragedies
of
insufficiency,
privation,
brute
necessity,
and subjugation
to illness
and death
that
simultaneously
define and
plague
existence.
Their
mere
factual
reality
is
sometimes
sufficient
to turn
even a
courageous
person
against
life.
It
has been
my
experience,
however,
that human
beings are
strong enough
to tolerate
the implicit
tragedies of
being without
faltering,
without
breaking,
or worse,
breaking bad.
I've seen
evidence of
this repeatedly
in my
private life,
in my
work as
a professor,
and in
my role
as a
clinical
practitioner.
Earthquakes,
floods,
poverty,
cancer,
we're tough
enough to
take on
all of
that,
but human
evil adds
a whole
new dimension
of misery
to the
world.
It is
for this
reason that
the rise
of self-consciousness
and its
attendant
realization
of mortality
and knowledge
of good
and evil
is presented
in the
early chapters
of
genesis
and in
the vast
tradition
that surrounds
them as
a cataclysm
of cosmic
magnitude.
Conscious
human malevolence
can break
the spirit
even tragedy
could not
shake.
I remember
discovering,
with her,
that one of
my clients
had been
shocked
into years
of serious
post-traumatic
stress disorder,
daily physical
shaking and
terror,
and chronic
nightly insomnia
by the mere
expression
on her
enraged,
drunken
boyfriend's
face.
His
fallen
countenance,
Genesis 4-5,
indicated his
clear and
conscious desire
to do her
harm.
She was more
naive than she
should have been,
and that
predisposed her
to the trauma,
but that's not
the point.
The voluntary
evil we do
one another
can be profoundly
and permanently
damaging,
even to the
strong.
And what is it
precisely that
motivates such
evil?
It doesn't
make itself
manifest
merely in
consequence
of the hard
lot of life.
It doesn't
even emerge
simply because
of failure
itself,
or because of
the disappointment
and bitterness
that failure
often and
understandably
engenders.
But the hard
lot of life,
magnified by
the consequence
of continually
rejected
sacrifices,
however poorly
conceptualized,
however
half-heartedly
executed,
that will
bend and
twist people
into the
truly monstrous
forms who
then begin
consciously to
work evil,
who then begin
to generate
for themselves
and others
little besides
pain and
suffering,
and who do
it for the
sake of that
pain and
suffering.
In that
manner,
a truly
vicious
circle takes
hold,
begrudging
sacrifice
half-heartedly
undertaken,
rejection of
that sacrifice
by God
or by reality,
take your
pick,
angry resentment
generated by
that rejection,
descent into
bitterness and
the desire for
revenge,
sacrifice undertaken
even more
begrudgingly or
refused altogether,
and it's hell
itself that serves
as the destination
place of that
downward spiral.
life is
indeed nasty,
brutish,
and short,
as the
English philosopher
Thomas Hobbes
so memorably
remarked,
but man's
capacity for
evil makes
it worse.
This means
that the
central problem
of life,
the dealing
with its
brute facts,
is not
merely what
and how
to sacrifice
to diminish
suffering,
but what
and how
to sacrifice
to diminish
suffering and
evil,
the conscious
and voluntary
and vengeful
source of
the worst
suffering.
The story of
Cain and
Abel is one
manifestation of
the archetypal
tale of the
hostile brothers,
hero and
adversary,
the two elements
of the individual
human psyche,
one aimed up
at the good
and the other
down at
hell itself.
Abel is a
hero,
true,
but a hero
who is
ultimately
defeated
by Cain.
Abel could
please God,
a non-trivial
and unlikely
accomplishment,
but he could
not overcome
human evil.
For this
reason,
Abel is
archetypally
incomplete.
Perhaps he
was naive,
although a
vengeful brother
can be
inconceivably
treacherous
and subtle,
like the
snake in
Genesis 3.1,
but excuses,
even reasons,
even understandable
reasons,
don't matter,
not in the
final analysis.
The problem
of evil
remained unsolved
even by the
divinely acceptable
sacrifices of
Abel.
It took
thousands of
additional years
for humanity
to come up
with anything
else resembling
a solution.
The same
issue emerges
again in its
culminating form
in the story
of Christ
and his
temptation
by Satan,
but this time
it's expressed
more comprehensively
and the hero
wins.
Evil
Confronted
Jesus
was led
into the
wilderness
according to
the story
to be tempted
by the
devil,
Matthew 4.1,
prior to
his crucifixion.
This is the
story of
Cain,
restated
abstractly.
Cain is
neither content
nor happy
as we have
seen.
He's working
hard,
or so he
thinks,
but God
is not
pleased.
Meanwhile,
Abel is,
by all
appearances,
dancing his
way through
life.
His crops
flourish.
Women love
him.
Worst of all,
he's a
genuinely good
man.
Everyone knows
it.
He deserves
his good
fortune.
All the more
reason to envy
and hate him.
Things do not
progress well for
Cain, by contrast,
and he broods on
his misfortune like a
vulture on an egg.
He strives in his
misery to give birth
to something hellish,
and in doing so
enters the desert
wilderness of his
own mind.
He obsesses over
his ill fortune,
his betrayal by
God.
He nourishes his
resentment.
He indulges in
ever more elaborate
fantasies of
revenge.
And as he does
so, his arrogance
grows to
Luciferian
proportions.
I'm ill-used
and oppressed,
he thinks.
This is a
stupid, bloody
planet.
As far as I'm
concerned, it can
go to hell.
And with that,
Cain encounters
Satan in the
wilderness for all
intents and
purposes, and
falls prey to his
temptations.
And he does what
he can to make
things as bad as
possible, motivated
by, in John
Milton's
imperishable words,
so deep a
malice to
confound the
race of mankind
kind in one
root, and
earth with
hell to
mingle and
involve, done
all to spite
the great
creator.
Cain turns to
evil to obtain
what good
denied him, and
he does it
voluntarily,
self-consciously,
and with
malice a
forethought.
Christ takes a
different path.
His sojourn in
the desert is the
dark night of the
soul, a deeply
human and
universal human
experience.
It's the journey to
that place each of
us goes when things
fall apart, friends
and family are
distant, hopelessness
and despair reign,
and black nihilism
beckons.
And, let us
suggest, in
testament to the
exactitude of the
story, forty days
and nights starving
alone in the
wilderness might take
you exactly to that
place.
It is in such a
manner that the
objective and
subject of worlds
come crashing
synchronistically
together.
Forty days is a
deeply symbolic
period of time,
echoing the
forty years the
Israelites spent
wandering in the
desert after
escaping the
tyranny of Pharaoh
and Egypt.
Forty days is a
long time in the
underworld of dark
assumptions, confusion
and fear, long
enough to journey
to the very
center, which is
hell itself.
A journey there
to see the sights
can be undertaken
by anyone.
Anyone, that is,
who is willing to
take the evil of
self and man with
sufficient seriousness,
a bit of familiarity
with history, can
help.
A sojourn through the
totalitarian horrors of
the twentieth century
with its concentration
camps, forced labor,
and murderous
ideological pathologies
is as good a place as
any to start.
That, and some
consideration of the
fact that the worst
of the concentration
camp guards were
human, all too
human, too.
That's all part of
making the desert
story real again,
part of updating it
for the modern
mind.
After Auschwitz,
said Theodor Adorno,
student of
authoritarianism,
there should be no
poetry.
He was wrong,
but the poetry
should be about
Auschwitz.
In the grim
wake of the last
ten decades of the
previous millennium,
the terrible
destructiveness of
man has become a
problem whose
seriousness self-evidently
dwarfs even the
problem of unredeemed
suffering.
And neither one of
those problems is
going to be solved in
the absence of a
solution to the
other.
This is where the
idea of Christ's
taking on the sins
of mankind as if
they were his own
becomes key,
opening the door to
deep understanding of
the desert encounter
with the devil
himself.
Homosum,
humani nihil
ame alienem puto,
said the Roman
playwright Terence.
Nothing human
is alien
to me.
No tree can
grow to heaven,
adds the ever
terrifying Carl
Gustav Jung
psychoanalyst
extraordinaire,
unless its roots
reach down to
hell.
Such a statement
should give everyone
who encounters it
pause.
There was no
possibility for
movement up
upward in that
great psychiatrist's
deeply considered
opinion, without a
corresponding move
down.
It is for this
reason that
enlightenment is so
rare.
Who is willing to
do that?
Do you really want
to meet who's in
charge at the very
bottom of the most
wicked thoughts?
What did Eric Harris,
mass murderer of the
Columbine High School,
write so
incomprehensibly the
very day prior to
massacring his
classmates?
It's interesting
when I'm in my
human form,
knowing I'm going
to die.
Everything has a
touch of triviality
to it.
Who would dare
explain such a
missive, or worse,
explain it away?
In the desert,
Christ encounters
Satan.
See Luke 4,
1-13, and Matthew
4, 1-11.
This story has a
clear psychological
meaning, a
metaphorical meaning,
in addition to
whatever else
material and
metaphysical alike
it might signify.
It means that
Christ is forever
he who determines
to take personal
responsibility for
the full depth of
human depravity.
It means that
Christ is eternally
he who is willing
to confront and
deeply consider and
risk the temptations
posed by the most
malevolent elements
of human nature.
It means that
Christ is always
he who is willing
to confront evil
consciously,
fully,
and voluntarily,
in the form that
dwelt simultaneously
within him and
in the world.
This is nothing
merely abstract,
although it is
abstract,
nothing to be
brushed over.
It's no merely
intellectual matter.
Soldiers who
develop post-traumatic
stress disorder
frequently develop it
not because of
something they saw,
but because of
something they did.
There are many
demons, so to speak,
on the battlefield.
Involvement in
warfare is something
that can open a
gateway to hell.
Now and then
something climbs
through and
possesses some
naive farm boy
away from Iowa
and he turns
monstrous.
He does something
terrible.
He rapes and
kills the women
and massacres the
infants of my lie
and he watches
himself do it
and some dark
part of him
enjoys it
and that is the
part that is
most unforgettable.
And,
later,
he will not
know how
to reconcile
himself with
the reality
about himself
and the world
that was then
revealed.
And no wonder.
In the great
and fundamental
myths of ancient
Egypt,
the god Horus,
often regarded
as a precursor
to Christ,
historically and
conceptually speaking,
experienced the
same thing
when he confronted
his evil uncle
Set,
usurper of the
throne of Osiris,
Horus' father.
Horus,
the all-seeing
Egyptian falcon
god,
the Egyptian
eye of supreme
eternal attention
itself,
has the courage
to contend
with Set's
true nature,
meeting him
in direct
combat.
In the struggle
with his dread
uncle,
however,
his consciousness
is damaged.
He loses
an eye.
This is despite
his godly
stature and
his unparalleled
capacity for
vision.
What would
a mere man
lose who
attempted the
same thing?
But perhaps
he might gain
in internal
vision and
understanding
something proportional
to what he
loses in
perception of
the outside
world.
Satan embodies
the refusal of
sacrifice.
He is arrogance,
incarnate,
spite,
deceit,
and cruel
conscious
malevolence.
He is pure
hatred of man,
God,
and being.
He will not
humble himself,
even when he
knows full well
that he should.
Furthermore,
he knows exactly
what he is doing,
obsessed with the
desire for
destruction,
and does it
deliberately,
thoughtfully,
and completely.
It has to be
him,
therefore,
the very
archetype of
evil,
who confronts
and tempts
Christ,
the archetype
of good.
It must be
him who offers
to the savior
of mankind,
under the most
trying of
conditions,
what all men
most ardently
desire.
Satan first
tempts the
starving Christ
to quell his
hunger by
transforming the
desert rocks
into bread.
Then he suggests
that he throw
himself off a
cliff,
calling on God
and the angels
to break his
fall.
Christ responds
to the first
temptation by
saying,
One does not
live by bread
alone,
but by every
word that
proceeds from
the mouth of
God.
What does this
answer mean?
It means that
even under
conditions of
extreme privation,
there are more
important things
than food.
To put it
another way,
bread is of
little use to
the man who
has betrayed
his soul,
even if he
is currently
starving.
Christ could
clearly use
his near-infinite
power as
Satan indicates
to gain bread
now to
break his
fast,
even in the
broader sense
to gain wealth
in the world,
which would
theoretically solve
the problem of
bread more
permanently.
But at what
cost?
And to what
gain?
Gluttony in the
midst of moral
desolation?
That's the
poorest and
most miserable
of feasts.
Christ aims
therefore at
something higher,
at the
description of
a mode of
being that
would finally
and forever
solve the
problem of
hunger.
If we all
chose,
instead of
expedience,
to dine on
the word of
God,
that would
require each
and every
person to
live and
produce and
sacrifice and
speak and
share in a
manner that
would permanently
render the
privation of
hunger a
thing of the
past.
And that's
how the
problem of
hunger in the
privations of
the desert is
most truly and
finally addressed.
There are other
indications of
this in the
Gospels in
dramatic,
enacted form.
Christ is
continually portrayed
as the purveyor of
endless sustenance.
He miraculously
multiplies bread and
fish.
He turns water
into wine.
What does this
mean?
It's a call to the
pursuit of higher
meaning as the
mode of living that
is simultaneously
most practical
and of highest
quality.
It's a call
portrayed in
dramatic slash
literary form.
Live as the
archetypal
saviour lives
and you and
those around you
will hunger
no more.
The beneficence
of the world
manifests itself
to those who
live properly.
That's better
than bread.
That's better
than the money
that will buy
bread.
Thus, Christ,
the symbolically
perfect individual,
overcomes the
first temptation.
Two more
follow.
Throw yourself
off that cliff,
Satan says,
offering the next
temptation.
If God exists,
he will surely
save you.
If you are in
fact his son,
God will surely
save you.
Why would God
not make himself
manifest to
rescue his only
begotten child
from hunger
and isolation
and the
presence of
great evil?
But that
establishes no
pattern for
life.
It doesn't
even work as
literature.
The deus
ex machina,
the emergence
of a divine
force that
magically rescues
the hero from
his predicament,
is the cheapest
trick in the
hack writer's
playbook.
It makes a
mockery of
independence and
courage and
destiny and
free will and
responsibility.
Furthermore,
God is in
no wise a
safety net for
the blind.
He's not
someone to be
commanded to
perform magic
tricks or
forced into
self-revelation,
not even by
his own son.
Do not put
the Lord your
God to the
test.
Matthew 4-7
This answer,
though rather
brief,
dispenses with
the second
temptation.
Christ does
not casually
order or even
dare ask God
to intervene on
his behalf.
He refuses to
dispense with
his responsibility
for the events
of his own
life.
He refuses to
demand that God
prove his
presence.
He refuses,
as well,
to solve the
problems of
mortal vulnerability
in a merely
personal manner,
by compelling
God to save
him, because
that would not
solve the
problem for
everyone else
and for all
time.
There is
also the
echo of
the rejection
of the
comforts of
insanity in
this foregone
temptation.
Easy but
psychotic
self-identification
as the
merely magical
Messiah might
well have been
a genuine
temptation under
the harsh
conditions of
Christ's
sojourn in
the desert.
Instead,
he rejects the
idea that
salvation,
or even
survival in
the shorter
term,
depends on
narcissistic
displays of
superiority and
the commanding
of God,
even by
his Son.
Finally,
comes the
third temptation,
the most
compelling of
all.
Christ sees
the kingdoms
of the world
laid before
him for
the taking.
That's the
siren call of
earthly power,
the opportunity
to control
and order
everyone and
everything.
Christ is
offered the
pinnacle of
the dominance
hierarchy,
the animalistic
desire of
every naked
ape,
the obedience
of all,
the most
wondrous of
estates,
the power to
build and
to increase,
the possibility
of unlimited
sensual
gratification.
That's
expedience
writ large.
But that's
not all.
Such expansion
of status also
provides unlimited
opportunity for
the inner
darkness to
reveal itself.
The lust for
blood, rape,
and destruction
is very much
part of
power's
attraction.
It is not
only that men
desire power
so that they
will no longer
suffer.
It is not
only that they
desire power
so that they
can overcome
subjugation to
want, disease,
and death.
Power also
means the
capacity to
take vengeance,
ensure submission,
and crush
enemies.

enough power
and he will
not only kill
Abel, he will
torture him
first,
imaginatively,
and endlessly.
Then, and
only then,
will he kill
him.
Then he will
come after
everyone else.
There's
something above
even the
pinnacle of
the highest
of dominance
hierarchies,
access to
which should
not be
sacrificed for
mere proximal
success.
It's a real
place, too,
although not to
be conceptualized
in the standard
geographical sense
of place we
typically use to
orient ourselves.
I had a vision
once of an
immense landscape
spread for
miles out to
the horizon
before me.
I was high
in the air,
granted a
bird's-eye
view.
Everywhere I
could see
great,
stratified,
multi-storied
pyramids of
glass, some
small, some
large, some
overlapping, some
separate, all
akin to modern
skyscrapers, all
full of people
striving to reach
each pyramid's
very pinnacle.
But there was
something above
that pinnacle, a
domain outside
each pyramid in
which all were
nested.
That was the
privileged position
of the eye that
could or perhaps
chose to soar
freely above the
fray, that chose
not to dominate any
specific group or
cause, but instead
to somehow
simultaneously
transcend all.
That was
attention itself,
pure and
untrammeled,
detached,
alert, watchful
attention, waiting
to act when the
time was right and
the place had been
established.
As the Tao Te Ching
has it, he who
contrives defeats
his purpose, and he
who is grasping
loses.
The sage does not
contrive to win,
and therefore is not
defeated.
He is not
grasping, so does
not lose.
There is a
powerful call to
proper being in
the story of the
third temptation.
To obtain the
greatest possible
prize, the
establishment of the
kingdom of God on
earth, the
resurrection of
paradise, the
individual must
conduct his or her
life in a manner
that requires the
rejection of
immediate gratification,
of natural and
perverse desires
alike, no matter
how powerfully and
convincingly and
realistically those
are offered, and
dispense as well with
the temptations of
evil.
Evil amplifies the
catastrophe of life,
increasing dramatically
the motivation for
expediency already
there because of the
essential tragedy of
being.
Sacrifice of the
more prosaic sort
can keep that tragedy
at bay more or less
successfully, but it
takes a special kind
of sacrifice to
defeat evil.
It is the
description of that
special sacrifice
that has preoccupied
the Christian, and
more than Christian,
imagination for
centuries.
Why has it not had
the desired effect?
Why do we remain
unconvinced that there
is no better plan than
lifting our eyes skyward,
aiming at the good, and
sacrificing everything
to that ambition?
Have we merely failed
to understand?
Or have we fallen,
willfully or otherwise,
off the path?
Christianity and its
problems
Carl Jung hypothesized
that the European mind
found itself motivated to
develop the cognitive
technologies of science
to investigate the
material world,
after implicitly
concluding that
Christianity, with its
laser-like emphasis on
spiritual salvation,
had failed to
sufficiently address the
problem of suffering in
the here and now.
This realization became
unbearably acute in the
three or four centuries
before the Renaissance.
In consequence, a
strange, profound,
compensatory fantasy began
to emerge deep in the
collective Western psyche,
manifesting itself first in
the strange musings of
alchemy, and developing
only after many centuries
into the fully articulated
form of science.
It was the alchemists
who first seriously
began to examine the
transformations of
matter, hoping to
discover the secrets of
health, wealth, and
longevity.
These great dreamers,
Newton foremost among
them, intuited, and
then imagined, that the
material world, damned
by the Church, held
secrets the revelation of
which could free
humanity from its
earthly pain and
limitations.
It was that vision,
driven by doubt, that
provided the tremendous
collective and
individual motivational
power necessary for the
development of science,
with its extreme
demands on individual
thinkers for
concentration and
delay of
gratification.
This is not to say
that Christianity, even
in its incompletely
realized form, was a
failure.
Quite the contrary.
Christianity achieved
the well-nigh
impossible.
The Christian doctrine
elevated the individual
soul, placing slave and
master and commoner and
nobleman alike on the same
metaphysical footing,
rendering them equal before
God and the law.
Christianity insisted that
even the king was only one
among many.
For something so contrary to
all apparent evidence to find
its footing, the idea that
worldly power and
prominence were indicators of
God's particular favor had to
be radically
de-emphasized.
This was partly
accomplished through the
strange Christian
insistence that salvation
could not be obtained through
effort or worth,
through works.
Whatever its
limitations, the
development of such
doctrine prevented king,
aristocrat, and wealthy
merchant alike from
lording it morally over
the commoner.
In consequence, the
metaphysical conception of
the implicit transcendent
worth of each and
every soul established
itself against
impossible odds as the
fundamental presupposition of
Western law and society.
That was not the case in the
world of the past and is not
the case yet in most places in
the world of the present.
It is in fact nothing short of
a miracle, and we should keep
this fact firmly before our
eyes, that the hierarchical,
slave-based societies of our
ancestors reorganized
themselves under the sway of
an ethical-slash-religious
revelation, such that the
ownership and absolute
domination of another person
came to be viewed as wrong.
It would do us well to
remember as well that the
immediate utility of slavery
is obvious, and that the
argument that the strong
should dominate the weak is
compelling, convenient, and
eminently practical, at least
for the strong.
This means that a
revolutionary critique of
everything slave-owning
societies valued was
necessary before the
practice could be even
questioned, let alone
halted, including the idea
that wielding power and
authority made the slave-owner
noble, including the even
more fundamental idea that the
power wielded by the slave-owner
was valid and even
virtuous.
Christianity made explicit the
surprising claim that even the
lowliest person had rights,
genuine rights, and that
sovereign and state were morally
charged at a fundamental level
to recognize those rights.
Christianity put forward
explicitly the even more
incomprehensible idea that the
act of human ownership degraded
the slaver, previously viewed as
admirable nobility, much or even
more than the slave.
We fail to understand how difficult
such an idea is to grasp.
We forget that the opposite was
self-evident throughout most of
human history.
We think that it is the desire to
enslave and dominate that requires
explanation.
We have it backwards yet again.
This is not to say that
Christianity was without its
problems, but it is more
appropriate to note that they were
the sort of problems that emerge
only after an entirely different
set of more serious problems
has been solved.
The society produced by
Christianity was far less
barbaric than the pagan, even
the Roman ones it replaced.
Christian society at least
recognized that feeding slaves to
ravenous lions for the
entertainment of the populace was
wrong, even if many barbaric
practices still existed.
It objected to infanticide, to
prostitution, and to the principle
that might means right.
It insisted that women were as
valuable as men, even though we
are still working out how to
manifest that insistence politically.
It demanded that even a society's
enemies be regarded as human.
Finally, it separated church from
state so that all two human
emperors could no longer claim the
veneration due to gods.
All of this was asking the
impossible, but it happened.
As the Christian revolution
progressed, however, the impossible
problems it had solved
disappeared from view.
That's what happens to problems
that are solved.
And after the solution was
implemented, even the fact that
such problems had ever existed
disappeared from view.
Then, and only then, could the
problems that remained, less amenable
to quick solution by Christian
doctrine, come to occupy a central
place in the consciousness of the
West, come to motivate, for example,
the development of science, aimed at
resolving the corporeal, material
suffering that was still all too
painfully extant within successfully
Christianized societies.
The fact that automobiles pollute only
becomes a problem of sufficient
magnitude to attract public
attention, when the far worse
problems that the internal
combustion engine solves have
vanished from view.
People stricken with poverty don't
care about carbon dioxide.
It's not precisely that CO2 levels
are irrelevant.
It's that they're irrelevant when
you're working yourself to death,
starving, scraping a bare living from
the stony, unyielding, thorn-and-thistle
infested ground.
It's that they're irrelevant until
after the tractor is invented and
hundreds of millions stop starving.
In any case, by the time Nietzsche
entered the picture in the late
19th century, the problems
Christianity had left unsolved had
become paramount.
Nietzsche described himself with no
serious overstatement as
philosophizing with a hammer.
His devastating critique of
Christianity, already weakened by its
conflict with the very sides to which
it had given rise, involved two main
lines of attack.
Nietzsche claimed, first, that it was
precisely the sense of truth,
developed in the highest sense by
Christianity itself, that ultimately
came to question and then to undermine
the fundamental presuppositions of the
faith.
That was partly because the difference
between moral or narrative truth and
objective truth had not yet been fully
comprehended, and so an opposition was
presumed where none necessarily exists, but
that does not belie the point.
Even when the modern atheists opposed to
Christianity belittle fundamentalists for
insisting, for example, that the creation
account in Genesis is objectively true, they
are using their sense of truth, highly developed
over the centuries of Christian culture, to
engage in such argumentation.
Carl Jung continued to develop Nietzsche's
arguments decades later, pointing out that
Europe awoke during the Enlightenment as if
from a Christian dream, noticing that
everything it had heretofore taken for
granted could and should be questioned.
God is dead, said Nietzsche.
God remains dead, and we have killed him.
How shall we, murderers of all murderers, console
ourselves?
That which was the holiest and mightiest of
all that the world has yet possessed, has
bled to death under our knives.
Who will wipe this blood off us?
The central dogmas of the Western faith were
no longer credible, according to Nietzsche, given
what the Western mind now considered truth.
But it was his second attack on the removal of
the true moral burden of Christianity during the
development of the Church that was most
devastating.
The hammer-wielding philosopher mounted an
assault on an early established and then highly
influential line of Christian thinking.
That Christianity meant accepting the proposition
that Christ's sacrifice, and only that sacrifice,
had redeemed humanity.
This did not mean, absolutely, that a Christian who
believed that Christ died on the cross for the
salvation of mankind was thereby freed from any and
all personal moral obligation.
But it did strongly imply that the primary responsibility
for redemption had already been borne by the
Saviour, and that nothing too important to do remained for
all two fallen human individuals.
Nietzsche believed that Paul, and later the Protestants following
Luther, had removed moral responsibility from Christ's
followers.
They had watered down the idea of the imitation of Christ.
This imitation was the sacred duty of the believer not to
adhere or merely to mouth a set of statements about abstract
belief, but instead to actually manifest the spirit of the
Saviour in the particular specific conditions of his or her life to
realize or incarnate the archetype as Jung had it, to clothe the
eternal pattern in flesh.
Nietzsche writes,
The Christians have never practiced the actions Jesus prescribed them, and the
impudent, garrulous talk about the justification by faith and its supreme and
sole significance is only the consequence of the church's lack of courage and
will to profess the works Jesus demanded.
Nietzsche was indeed a critic without parallel.
Dogmatic belief in the central axioms of Christianity, that Christ's crucifixion
redeemed the world, that salvation was reserved for the hereafter, that salvation could not be
achieved through works, had three mutually reinforcing consequences.
First, devaluation of the significance of earthly life, as only the hereafter mattered.
This also meant that it had become acceptable to overlook and shirk responsibility for the
suffering that existed in the here and now.
Second, passive acceptance of the status quo, because salvation could not be earned in any
case through effort in this life, a consequence that Marx also derided with his proposition that
religion was the opiate of the masses.
And, finally, third, the right of the believer to reject any real moral burden outside of the
stated belief in salvation through Christ, because the Son of God had already done all the
important work.
It was for such reasons that Dostoevsky, who was a great influence on Nietzsche, also criticized
institutional Christianity, although he arguably managed it in a more ambiguous, but also more
sophisticated manner.
In his masterwork, The Brothers Karamazov, Dostoevsky has his atheist superman, Ivan, tell a little
story, The Grand Inquisitor.
A brief review is in order.
Ivan speaks to his brother, Alyosha, whose pursuits as a monastic novitiate he holds in
contempt of Christ returning to earth at the time of the Spanish Inquisition.
The returning savior makes quite a ruckus, as would be expected.
He heals the sick.
He raises the dead.
His antics soon attract attention from the Grand Inquisitor himself, who promptly has Christ
arrested and thrown into a prison cell.
Later, the Inquisitor pays him a visit.
He informs Christ that he is no longer needed.
His return is simply too great a threat to the Church.
The Inquisitor tells Christ that the burden he laid on mankind, the burden of existence
in faith and truth, was simply too great for mere mortals to bear.
The Inquisitor claims that the Church, in its mercy, diluted that message, lifting the demand
for perfect being from the shoulders of its followers, providing them instead with the
simple and merciful escapes of faith and the afterlife.
That work took centuries, says the Inquisitor.
And the last thing the Church needs after all that effort is the return of the man who insisted
that people bear all the weight in the first place.
Christ listens in silence.
Then, as the Inquisitor turns to leave, Christ embraces him and kisses him on the lips.
The Inquisitor turns white in shock.
Then he goes out, leaving the cell door open.
The profundity of this story and the greatness of spirit necessary to produce it can hardly
be exaggerated.
Dostoevsky, one of the great literary geniuses of all time, confronted the most serious existential
problems in all his great writings, and he did so courageously, headlong, and heedless
of the consequences.
Clearly Christian, he nonetheless adamantly refuses to make a straw man of his right.
rationalist and atheistic opponents.
Quite the contrary.
In the Brothers Karamazov, for example, Dostoevsky's atheist, Ivan, argues against the presuppositions
of Christianity with unsurpassable clarity and passion.
Alyosha, aligned with the Church by temperament and decision, cannot undermine a single one of
his brother's arguments, although his faith remains unshakable.
Dostoevsky knew and admitted that Christianity had been defeated by the rational faculty,
by the intellect even, but, and this is of primary importance, he did not hide from that
fact.
He did not attempt through denial or deceit or even satire to weaken the position that
opposed what he believed to be most true and valuable.
He instead placed action above words and addressed the problem successfully.
By the novel's end, Dostoevsky has the great embodied moral goodness of Alyosha, the novitiate's
courageous imitation of Christ, attained victory over the spectacular but ultimately nihilistic
critical intelligence of Ivan.
The Christian Church described by the Grand Inquisitor is the same Church pilloried by Nietzsche.
Childish, sanctimonious, patriarchal, servant of the state, that Church is everything rotten
still objected to by modern critics of Christianity.
Nietzsche, for all his brilliance, allows himself anger, but does not perhaps sufficiently temper it
with judgment.
This is where Dostoevsky truly transcends Nietzsche, in my estimation, where Dostoevsky's great literature
transcends Nietzsche's mere philosophy.
The Russian writer's Inquisitor is the genuine article in every sense.
He is an opportunistic, cynical, manipulative, and cruel interrogator, willing to persecute heretics,
even to torture and kill them.
He is the purveyor of a dogma he knows to be false.
But Dostoevsky has Christ, the archetypal perfect man.
Kiss him anyway.
Equally importantly, in the aftermath of the kiss, the Grand Inquisitor leaves the door ajar
so Christ can escape his pending execution.
Dostoevsky saw that the great corrupt edifice of Christianity still managed to make room for
the spirit of the spirit of its founder.
That's the gratitude of a wise and profound soul for the enduring wisdom of the West, despite its faults.
It's not as if Nietzsche was unwilling to give the faith, and, more particularly, Catholicism,
its due.
Nietzsche believed that the long tradition of unfreedom characterizing dogmatic Christianity,
its insistence that everything be explained within the confines of a single, coherent,
metaphysical theory, was a necessary precondition for the emergence of the disciplined, but free,
modern mind.
As he stated in Beyond Good and Evil,
the long bondage of the spirit, the persistent spiritual will to interpret everything that happened
according to a Christian scheme, and in every occurrence to rediscover and justify the Christian
God in every accident, all this violence, arbitrariness, severity, dreadfulness, and unreasonableness
has proved itself the disciplinary means whereby the European spirit has attained its strength,
its remorseless curiosity, and subtle mobility, granted also that much irrecoverable strength
and spirit had to be stifled, suffocated, and spoiled in the process.
For Nietzsche and Dostoevsky alike, freedom, even the ability to act, requires constraint.
For this reason, they both recognize the vital necessity of the dogma of the church.
The individual must be constrained, molded, even brought close to destruction by a restrictive,
coherent, disciplinary structure, before he or she can act freely and competently.
Dostoevsky, with his great generosity of spirit, granted to the church, corrupt as it might be,
a certain element of mercy, a certain pragmatism, he admitted that the spirit of Christ, the world
engendering logos, had historically and might still find its resting place, even its sovereignty,
within that dogmatic structure.
If a father disciplines his son properly, he obviously interferes with his freedom,
particularly in the here and now.
He puts limits on the voluntary expression of his son's being, forcing him to take his place
as a socialized member of the world.
Such a father requires that all that childish potential be funneled down a single pathway.
In placing such limitations on his son, he might be considered a destructive force,
acting as he does to replace the miraculous plurality of childhood with a single narrow actuality.
But if the father does not take such action, he merely lets his son remain Peter Pan, the eternal
boy, king of the lost boys, ruler of the non-existent Neverland.
That is not a morally acceptable alternative.
The dogma of the church was undermined by the spirit of truth strongly developed by the church
itself.
That undermining culminated in the death of God.
But the dogmatic structure of the church was a necessary disciplinary structure,
a long period of unfreedom.
Adherence to a singular interpretive structure is necessary for the development of a free
mind.
Christian dogma provided that unfreedom.
But the dogma is dead, at least to the modern Western mind, perished along with God.
What has emerged from behind its corpse, however, and this is an issue of central importance,
is something even more dead, something that was never alive even in the past, nihilism as
well as an equally dangerous susceptibility to new, totalizing, utopian ideas.
It was in the aftermath of God's death that the great collective horrors of communism and
fascism sprang forth as both Dostoevsky and Nietzsche predicted they would.
Nietzsche, for his part, posited that individual human beings would have to invent their own
values in the aftermath of God's death.
But this is the element of his thinking that appears weakest psychologically.
We cannot invent our own values because we cannot merely impose what we believe on our
souls.
This was Carl Jung's great discovery, made in no little part because of his intense study
of the problems posed by Nietzsche.
We rebel against our own totalitarianism as much as that of others.
I cannot merely order myself to action, and neither can you.
I will stop procrastinating, I say, but I don't.
I will eat properly, I say, but I don't.
I cannot merely make myself over in the image constructed by my intellect, particularly if
that intellect is possessed by an ideology.
I have a nature, and so do you, and so do we all.
We must discover that nature and contend with it before making peace with ourselves.
What is it that we most truly are?
What is it that we could most truly become, knowing who we most truly are?
We must get to the very bottom of things before such questions can be truly answered.
Doubt.
Past mere nihilism.
Three hundred years before Nietzsche, the great French philosopher René Descartes set out
on an intellectual mission to take his doubts seriously, to break things apart, to get to
what was essential, to see if he could establish or discover a single proposition impervious to
his skepticism.
He was searching for the foundation stone on which proper being could be established.
Descartes found it, as far as he was concerned, in the I who thinks, the I who is aware, as
expressed in his famous dictum, cogito ergo sum, I think, therefore I am.
But that I had been conceptualized long before.
Thousands of years ago, the aware I was the all-seeing I of Horus, the great Egyptian sun and sun god,
who renewed the state by attending to and then confronting its inevitable corruption.
Before that, it was the creator god Marduk of the Mesopotamians, whose eyes encircled his
head and who spoke forth words of world-engendering magic.
During the Christian epoch, the I transformed into the logos, the word that speaks order into
being at the beginning of time.
It might be said that Descartes merely secularized the logos, turning it, more explicitly, into
that which is aware and thinks.
That's the modern self, simply put.
But what exactly is that self?
We can understand, to some degree, its horrors, if we wish to, but its goodness remains more
difficult to define.
The self is the great actor of evil, who strode about the stage of being as Nazi and Stalinist
alike, who produced Auschwitz, Buchenwald, Dachau, and the multiplicity of the Soviet gulags.
And all of that must be considered with dread seriousness.
But what is its opposite?
What is the good that is the necessary counterpart of that evil, that is made more corporeal and
comprehensible by the very existence of that evil?
And here we can state, with conviction and clarity, that even the rational intellect, that
faculty so beloved of those who hold traditional wisdom in contempt, is at minimum something
closely and necessarily akin to the archetypal dying and eternally resurrected God, the eternal
saviour of humanity, the Logos itself.
The philosopher of science, Karl Popper, certainly no mystic, regarded thinking itself as a logical
extension of the Darwinian process.
A creature that cannot think must solely embody its being.
It can merely act out its nature, concretely, in the here and now.
If it cannot manifest in its behaviour what the environment demands while doing so, it will
simply die.
But that is not true of human beings.
We can produce abstracted representations of potential modes of being.
We can produce an idea in the theatre of the imagination.
We can test it out against our other ideas, the ideas of others, or the world itself.
If it falls short, we can let it go.
We can, in Popper's formulation, let our ideas die in our stead.
Then the essential part, the creator of those ideas, can continue onward, now untrammeled
by comparison with error.
Faith in the part of us that continues across those deaths is a prerequisite to thinking itself.
Now, an idea is not the same thing as a fact.
A fact is something that is dead in and of itself.
It has no consciousness, no will to power, no motivation, no action.
There are billions of dead facts.
The internet is a graveyard of dead facts.
But an idea that grips a person is alive.
It wants to express itself, to live in the world.
It is for this reason that the depth psychologists, Freud and Jung, paramount among them, insisted
that the human psyche was a battleground for ideas.
An idea has an aim.
It wants something.
It posits a value structure.
An idea believes that what it is aiming for is better than what it has now.
It reduces the world to those things that aid or impede its realization.
And it reduces everything else to irrelevance.
An idea defines figure against ground.
An idea is a personality, not a fact.
When it manifests itself within a person, it has a strong proclivity to make of that person
its avatar, to impel that person to act it out.
Sometimes that impulsion, possession is another word, can be so strong that the person will die
rather than allowing the idea to perish.
This is, generally speaking, a bad decision, given that it is often the case that only the idea need die
and that the person with the idea can stop being its avatar, change his or her ways, and continue.
To use the dramatic conceptualization of our ancestors,
it is the most fundamental convictions that must die, must be sacrificed,
when the relationship with God has been disrupted,
when the presence of undue and often intolerable suffering, for example,
indicates that something has to change.
This is to say nothing other than that the future can be made better
if the proper sacrifices take place in the present.
No other animal has ever figured this out.
And it took us untold hundreds of thousands of years to do it.
It took further eons of observation and hero worship,
and then millennia of study,
to distill that idea into a story.
It then took additional vast stretches of time to assess that story,
to incorporate it, so that we can now simply say,
if you are disciplined and privilege the future over the present,
you can change the structure of reality in your favor.
But how best to do that?
In 1984, I started down the same road as Descartes.
I did not know it was the same road at the time,
and I am not claiming kinship with Descartes,
who is rightly regarded as one of the greatest philosophers of all time.
But I was truly plagued with doubt.
I had outgrown the shallow Christianity of my youth
by the time I could understand the fundamentals of Darwinian theory.
After that, I could not distinguish the basic elements of Christian belief
from wishful thinking.
The socialism that soon afterward became so attractive to me as an alternative
proved equally insubstantial.
With time, I came to understand, through the great George Orwell,
that much of such thinking found its motivation in hatred of the rich and successful
instead of true regard for the poor.
Besides, the socialists were more intrinsically capitalist than the capitalists.
They believed just as strongly in money.
They just thought that if different people had the money,
the problems plaguing humanity would vanish.
This is simply untrue.
There are many problems that money does not solve,
and others that it makes worse.
Rich people still divorce each other,
and alienate themselves from their children,
and suffer from existential angst,
and develop cancer and dementia,
and die alone and unloved.
Recovering addicts cursed with money blow it all in a frenzy of snorting and drunkenness,
and boredom weighs heavily on people who have nothing to do.
I was simultaneously tormented by the fact of the Cold War.
It obsessed me.
It gave me nightmares.
It drove me into the desert,
into the long night of the human soul.
I could not understand how it had come to pass
that the world's two great factions
aimed mutual assured destruction at each other.
Was one system just as arbitrary and corrupt as the other?
Was it a mere matter of opinion?
Were all value structures merely the clothing of power?
Was everyone crazy?
Just exactly what happened in the 20th century, anyway.
How was it that so many tens of millions had to die,
sacrificed to the new dogmas and ideologies?
How was it that we discovered something worse,
much worse,
than the aristocracy and corrupt religious beliefs
that communism and fascism sought so rationally to supplant?
No one had answered those questions,
as far as I could tell.
Like Descartes, I was plagued with doubt.
I searched for one thing,
anything I could regard as indisputable.
I wanted a rock upon which to build my house.
It was doubt that led me to it.
I once read of a particularly insidious practice at Auschwitz.
A guard would force an inmate to carry a hundred-pound sack of wet salt
from one side of the large compound to the other,
and then to carry it back.
Arbeit macht frei,
said the sign over the camp entrance.
Work will set you free.
And the freedom was death.
Carrying the salt was an act of pointless torment.
It was a piece of malevolent art.
It allowed me to realize with certainty
that some actions are wrong.
Alexander Solzhenitsyn wrote definitively and profoundly
about the horrors of the 20th century,
the tens of millions who were stripped of employment,
family,
identity,
and life.
In his Gulag Archipelago,
in the second part of the second volume,
he discussed the Nuremberg Trials,
which he considered the most significant event
of the 20th century.
The conclusion of those trials?
There are some actions that are so intrinsically terrible
that they run counter to the proper nature of human being.
This is true essentially,
cross-culturally,
across time and place.
These are evil actions.
No excuses are available for engaging in them.
To dehumanize a fellow being,
to reduce him or her to the status of a parasite,
to torture and to slaughter
with no consideration of individual innocence or guilt,
to make an art form of pain,
that is wrong.
What can I not doubt?
The reality of suffering.
It brooks no arguments.
Nihilists cannot undermine it with skepticism.
Totalitarians cannot banish it.
Cynics cannot escape from its reality.
Suffering is real.
And the artful infliction of suffering on another,
for its own sake,
is wrong.
That became the cornerstone of my belief.
Searching through the lowest reaches of human thought and action,
understanding my own capacity to act like a Nazi prison guard
or a Gulag Archipelago trustee,
or a torturer of children in a dungeon,
I grasped what it meant
to take the sins of the world onto oneself.
Each human being has an immense capacity for evil.
Each human being understands a priori,
perhaps not what is good,
but certainly what is not.
And if there is something that is not good,
then there is something that is good.
If the worst sin is the torment of others,
merely for the sake of the suffering produced,
then the good is whatever is diametrically opposed to that.
The good is whatever stops such things from happening.
Meaning as the higher good
It was from this that I drew my fundamental moral conclusions.
Aim up.
Pay attention.
Fix what you can fix.
Don't be arrogant in your knowledge.
Strive for humility,
because totalitarian pride manifests itself in intolerance,
oppression, torture, and death.
Become aware of your own insufficiency,
your cowardice, malevolence, resentment, and hatred.
Consider the murderousness of your own spirit
before you dare accuse others
and before you attempt to repair the fabric of the world.
Maybe it's not the world that's at fault.
Maybe it's you.
You've failed to make the mark.
You've missed the target.
You've fallen short of the glory of God.
You've sinned.
And all of that is your contribution
to the insufficiency and evil of the world.
And, above all, don't lie.
Don't lie about anything.
Ever.
Lying leads to hell.
It was the great and the small lies
of the Nazi and Communist states
that produced the deaths of millions of people.
Consider, then, that the alleviation
of unnecessary pain and suffering is a good.
Make that an axiom.
To the best of my ability,
I will act in a manner
that leads to the alleviation
of unnecessary pain and suffering.
You have now placed at the pinnacle
of your moral hierarchy
a set of presuppositions and actions
aimed at the betterment of being.
Why?
Because we know the alternative.
The alternative was the 20th century.
The alternative was so close to hell.
