this is audible what is knowledge a crash course in epistemology written and narrated by j m kuczynski
knowledge is always knowledge of truths one is aware of objects and one knows truths about them but one does not know them at least not in the sense in which one knows that one plus one equals two
a truth is a true proposition a falsehood is a false proposition when one makes a statement the thing one is thereby affirming is a proposition
if i say john smokes and i do so knowing what my words mean and with the intention of affirming that meaning the thing i am affirming is the proposition that john smokes
this proposition is not a linguistic expression it is what is meant by such an expression and is therefore not itself such an expression and this thing is not a belief it is the object of a belief and is therefore not itself a belief
nor by parody of reasoning is it identical with any other sort of mental entity when it is said of a belief or a sentence or a speech act that it is true what is meant is that the corresponding proposition is true
this is obviously not what is meant when a proposition is described as true in a moment it will be said what is meant propositions are not facts that is to say they are not spatiotemporal entities they are not structures that consist of occupants of space-time
the proposition john smokes can be affirmed denied believed doubted etc but it cannot be physically altered in fact it cannot be altered in any way
this is because it is not itself spatiotemporal also even if john does not smoke the proposition john smokes exists no proposition depends for its existence on its being true
therefore truths truths true propositions in other words are not distributions or redistributions of mass energy a proposition is a class of properties of characteristics in other words
and for a proposition to be true is for the members of the corresponding property set to be instantiated let k be the smallest set containing the following three properties
p one the property of being identical with john p two the property of smoking and p three the property of being a thing x such that x is identical with john and such that x smokes
john smokes if and only if these three properties are jointly instantiated in other words if they are instantiated then john smokes and if john smokes they are instantiated
therefore the proposition john smokes is to be identified with k and that proposition's being true is to be identified with those three properties being jointly instantiated
to be sure if p three is instantiated then so are p one and p two so it might seem that john smokes could be identified with p three and that its being true could be identified with p three's being instantiated it being unnecessary to identify that proposition with k since k contains p one and p two
but there are two conditions that a viable theory of truth must satisfy first it must account for any given proposition's truth conditions
in other words for any given proposition t if t is true under such and such circumstances then a viable theory of truth must account for that fact and if t is false under thus and such circumstances a viable theory of truth must account for that fact as well
at the same time a viable theory of truth must also do justice to the internal structural properties of propositions it must account for their decompositional properties in other words
it is a datum that john smokes has a discrete part corresponding to john a second discrete part corresponding to smokes and a third part this being an improper part corresponding to the fusion of the two
our theory is consistent with these facts about the decomposition of john smokes in general our theory unlike the other theory considered is consistent with the decompositional properties of propositions
it is truths that are known falsehoods can be believed but they cannot be known and true beliefs must be justified if they are to be knowledge if i have a correct belief but i have it for the wrong reasons it is not knowledge
if i believe that all people who wear earmuffs are geniuses and i believe on that basis and on that basis alone that my earmuff wearing friend fred is a genius i do not know that fred is a genius even if as it happens he is a genius
but even though all cases of knowledge are cases of justified true belief not all cases of justified true belief are cases of knowledge if i look at a broken clock that happens to be right and on that basis i believe it to be two p m
i do not know it to be two p m even if given the information available to me i am justified in believing the clock to be reliable and even if consequently i am justified in believing the time to be two p m
in order for my belief to be a case of knowledge it is necessary that in addition to being true it be the end result of processes that are information transmissive
for a physical process to be information transmissive is for it to be structure preservative when you talk into a phone the sounds you make are converted into electrical impulses that are structure identical with those sounds
and the other person's phone converts those impulses into sounds that are structure identical with them and therefore with the sounds that you originally made
by thus preserving structure this process transmits information if on the basis of the readout of a broken clock you believe the time to be two p m your belief is not the end result of a structure preservative process and it therefore does not embody information about the external world
notwithstanding that it is true and justified but suppose that the clock were functioning properly and were set to the right time in that case the readout on the clock would be hewed to the time in which case the readout on the clock would be genuinely information transmissive with respect to the time
in which case your belief that it was two p m would embody such information and would therefore be knowledge there are two kinds of knowledge empirical and analytic
analytic knowledge is knowledge of purely conceptual truth for example any given circle is a closed planar figure another example is nothing can be literate without being animate an empirical truth is an observation-based truth no knowledge is strictly observation-based
there is always a ratios native component knowledge is analytic when there is no empirical component to it otherwise it is empirical
the fact that no knowledge is strictly observation-based is a consequence of the fact that it is propositions that are known not objects one observes objects one does not observe truths
in other words one does not observe true propositions one observes assemblages of spatiotemporal entities in virtue of which truths hold but one does not observe truths per se
this is a corollary of the fact cited earlier that truths are sets of properties one observes instances of properties not properties per se one observes particular instances of roundness tallness redness etc one does not observe the corresponding properties
also given any one empirical proposition there is no one sort of observation that warrants acceptance of that proposition and given any observation or observation class there is no one sort of proposition whose acceptance is thereby warranted
consider the proposition john smokes there is no one sort of observation that warrants acceptance of that proposition and any observation or class of observations that warrant acceptance of that proposition also warrant acceptance of many other propositions
also one observes only what is not what isn't nor a fortiori what cannot possibly be when i look inside a room i see what is in the room not what isn't i don't see john's absence i see various presences and on that basis deduce that john is absent
in general negative truths are not known strictly on the basis of observation the same is true of disjunctive truths truths truths of the form either p or q
it may be that my visual perception of the new car in john's driveway warrants acceptance of the proposition either john bought a new car or that car belongs to a house-guest but if so that is because my perception
directly warrants acceptance of some non-disjunctive proposition some proposition along the lines of there is a new car in john's driveway which in its turn warrants acceptance of the aforementioned disjunction
there cannot possibly be any strictly observational basis for acceptance of statements of the form q follows from p which means p is incompatible with not q which in turn means the joint truth of not q and p is an impossibility
since one cannot observe what isn't let alone what cannot possibly be observation cannot at least not by itself warrant acceptance of any statement of the form if p then q also belief and therefore knowledge necessarily involves classification
to believe that john smokes is to believe that john belongs to the class of smokers to believe that chester is green is to believe that chester belongs to the class of green things
but sense perception cannot itself result from an act of classification since such an act would presuppose awareness not just of the object being classified but also of its having such properties as to warrant its being classified in a certain way
therefore a sense perception could result from an act of classification only if there were some other prior state of awareness from whose content that of the sense perception were derived but in that case that other awareness would be the sense perception
a sense perception is by definition an awareness of an occupant of the external world that is non-inferential classification is a form of inference and sense perception therefore precedes inference
thus it isn't that some truths are known strictly on the basis of observation and others are not it is rather that no truths are known strictly on the basis of observation no knowledge is strictly empirical some knowledge is partly empirical
what we call knowledge is conceptually articulated awareness it is one thing for me to be aware of the uncomfortable tightness of my shoes it is quite another for me to know that my shoes are uncomfortably tight
i cannot know the latter without having various concepts shoe tight uncomfortable foot etc but i can certainly experience an uncomfortable feeling in my feet without having those concepts and indeed without having any concepts
my having knowledge of that truth involves my conceptualizing my feelings of discomfort it involves my understanding those feelings in terms of the aforementioned concepts
raw observation gives me the feeling but it is up to me to use the concepts that i have to articulate that feeling into something that can be known this is because to articulate an observation is to classify its contents and observation precedes classification as we just saw
therefore observation observation cannot tell me how to use the concepts that i have to articulate the deliverances of observation observation could tell me this only if observations themselves were already conceptually articulated which they are not for the reasons just stated
therefore nothing empirical is known unless it is known unless it is known how to interpret observations and observation cannot in all cases tell me how it is to be interpreted given an ability on my part to interpret my observations observation can obviously improve my ability to interpret observation
but it couldn't tell me how to do so unless i could already interpret it since consequently the interpretive principles involved in the interpretation of observation are not always themselves known on the basis of observation
it follows that at least some knowledge is analytic indeed this follows from the very fact that we have observation-based knowledge given that we have empirical knowledge it follows that we have non-empirical knowledge this follows because it is by using non-empirical knowledge to interpret sensory observations that we acquire empirical knowledge
all empirical knowledge is inferential i leave it open whether all non-empirical knowledge is inferential none the less there is a significant sense in which some empirical knowledge is non-empirical
suppose that i have observations of rain and on the basis of my duly conceptually articulating those observations believe it to be raining in that case those inferences tell me what it is that i am observing
now suppose that i have observations of rain and on the basis of my duly conceptually articulating said observations believe it to be raining and on that basis believe that there will be terrible mosquitoes in the yard a few hours hence
the second set of inferences don't tell me what it is that i am currently observing they tell me what will be the case given what it is that according to my observations currently is the case
setting aside cases of our speaking falsely when we say of a given belief that it is non- inferential what we mean is that no inferences were involved on the subject's part other than such as were needed to apprise the subject of what it was that he observed
and when we say of a given belief that it is inferential what we mean is that a second set of inferences is involved our beliefs about the past future and merely possible are categorically inferential in this second sense our beliefs about the so-called observable present are not always inferential in the second sense
as previously stated all empirical beliefs are inferential in the first sense
if i know that there currently exists an x and i also know that x's always lead to y's then i can deduce and therefore know that there will be a y if i know that there is a y and that y's are always preceded by x's then i can deduce and therefore know that there was an x
if i know that x's always bring about y's then i know that if there were an x there would be a y all theoretical knowledge is inferential but not all inferential knowledge is theoretical
i know that john is sniffing pepper and also that anyone who does so sneezes and on that basis i know that john is going to sneeze this knowledge of mine is inferential but it is not theoretical
theoretical knowledge is theory-based knowledge a theory is an integrated body of propositions that if correct describes some otherwise hidden structural fact about the spatiotemporal world theories when true tell us how the universe is structured
to be sure sometimes people use the word theory to describe beliefs about specific situations this being the sense in which there are various quote-unquote theories concerning jfk's assassination and concerning the authorship of hamlet
but when people say that francis bacon as opposed to shakespeare was the author of hamlet or that lee hervey oswald was merely the trigger man it being sam giancana who really killed kennedy
when people say such things they are not making a claim whose scope is confined to some one incident they are saying that human affairs are governed by forces very different from those by which we believe them to be governed the incident in question merely being proof or evidence of this
in any case as the word theory is used in science and in the philosophy thereof a theory is an integrative body of propositions that if correct tells us about the structure of some comprehensive or otherwise significant domain
thus a theory if correct apprises us of dependence relations more precisely theories when true apprise us of dependence relations of the causal variety not of the logical variety
the statement any given statement is a consequence of the negation of its own negation describes a logical dependence relation meaning that it says how one statement's truth value depends on some other statement's truth value
the statement oxygen deprivation causes death describes a causal dependence relation meaning that it says how one state of affairs that of being alive depends on some other state of affairs that of being adequately oxygenated
when a theory is correct it does not merely apprise us of one causal mechanism it apprises us of systems of such mechanisms or rather it makes it clear how various causal mechanisms previously known to exist are interrelated relativity theory explains the null outcome of the michelson morley experiment
it explains the lorenz fitzgerald contraction it apprises us of the phenomenon of time dilation and also of the non-additivity of volume and mass and most importantly it explains how all of these things are interrelated
suppose that i know p and on the basis of my knowledge of a single causal mechanism infer and therefore know that q in that case my knowledge that q is true is inferential but it is not theoretical
but suppose i know that p and on the basis of my knowledge of the way in which a multiplicity of different causal mechanisms are interrelated i infer and therefore know that q in that case my knowledge that q is true is theoretical
it is obvious that things make things happen that certain events are the consequences of others the button is pushed the bell rings the rock is thrown the window shatters and so on
according to some philosophers we see events and sequences thereof but we don't see causal connections holding among events and we therefore don't have good reason to believe such connections to exist
this is erroneous the concept of spatial occupancy is a causal concept an occupant of a given region ipso facto affects the locations and trajectories of other bodies the concept of persistence is a causal concept a thing persists if its present condition is the effect of its previous condition
what we tend to think of as causal sequences are actually cases of two causal sequences crossing paths the rock is a causal sequence and so is the window and when the collision of the two shatters the window that is a disruption of a causal sequence namely the causal sequence with which the window's very existence is identical
so the question how do we become aware of instances of causation is misconceived we cannot be aware of anything persistent or therefore of any case of continuous motion without for that very reason being aware of an instance of causation
by the same token if we want to know what causes what we need to know what is continuous with what and this is how we distinguish actual causal relations from correlations that mimic causal relations suppose that everybody in small town drives a mercedes and also smokes five packs of cigarettes every day
and also suppose that everyone in small town either has lung cancer or will get it by the age of forty the skeptic says we don't know what is responsible for the high rates of cancer among small town residents maybe it's that they smoked much but it's equally possible that it's because they drive mercedes
the skeptic's position is wrong and misconceived statistical correlations are not themselves causal connections they sometimes give us a rough idea of where to look for causal connections but if we want to know what causes what there is one thing and one thing alone that we must know namely what is continuous with what
the residents of small town inhale smoke and therewith tar and other noxious chemicals which take root in their lungs and various physiological changes ensue the smoking is continuous with the subsequent cancer the mercedes ownership is not and that's the end of the matter
if as many a skeptical philosopher has alleged causal connections were known only by knowing correlations then there would indeed be no way to distinguish causation from correlation but that is not how causal connections are known ever
sometimes knowledge of correlations is a precursor to knowledge of correlations but that's all it is nothing more and the skeptic's position in this context at least is entirely without substance
and it is equally without substance in other domains the skeptic asks how do we know that we aren't always hallucinating here's the answer if the skeptic is right our perceptions come out of nowhere they have no causes if the non-skeptic is right they do not come out of nowhere
so the skeptic's way of modeling the data is to say that there is no way to model it the non-skeptic's way of modeling the data is to posit continuously existing realities of which the realities of which we have direct awareness are mere fragments
yes the skeptic replies but given only that the non-skeptic's way of modeling the data is a good one it doesn't follow that it is correct and it therefore doesn't follow that the skeptic's way of modeling the data is wrong
the skeptic's reasoning once again is misconceived other things being equal t1 is a better theory than t2 if reality contains fewer causal anomalies if t1 is correct than if t2 is correct this we know this is an analytic truth
given that by this yardstick some theory t1 is better than some other theory t2 does it follow that t1 is correct no does it follow that it is more reasonable to accept t1 than it is to accept t2 yes
also the skeptic's position isn't really a position his position for lack of a better word is that there is no explanation to be had contrary to what the skeptic believes his position is not one of cautious conservatism
the non-skeptic only has to be right about one thing he has to believe that there are external realities of which our internal processes are instalments but the skeptic has to be right about infinitely many things each of which is independent of all the others
given any perception he must be right to say of it that it comes out of nowhere also given some one perception that persists for some length of time what is the skeptic to say about it
is he willing to grant that the perception's existence at time t1 is causally responsible for its existence at time t2 if not then why does he speak of a perception that is of an enduring perception
and surely the skeptic must grant that mental states endure and therefore that a mental state's existence at one time can be causally dispositive of its own existence at later times
but if the skeptic grants this as he must then he must grant that there are causal ties and if he grants this then his position if he still holds on to it becomes even more absurd than before
the skeptic asks how can we know the future given only that things have been a certain way thus far says the skeptic it doesn't follow that they will continue to be that way we can't know that the past is indicative of the future unless we know that the laws of nature do not change but we can't know that they will not change unless we know that the future resembles the past
once again the skeptic's position is misconceived the non-skeptic does not hold that the future will necessarily resemble the past the non-skeptic holds that discontinuity is harder to explain than continuity that which comes from nothing is anomalous that which comes from something is non-anomalous
according to the skeptic that which comes from nothing is no more anomalous than that which comes from something which is absurd also one cannot coherently deny that one's own mind persists in time
therefore one cannot deny that one's previous mental condition is responsible not only for the existence but also for the specific character of one's current mental condition
and if one holds this one cannot without arbitrariness deny that the existence of one's current mental state is dispositive of the existence of later mental states for whose character it will to some extent be responsible
and in granting this one is granting that how things are does sometimes influence how they will be thus we know that at least sometimes something comes from something
at the same time we don't know that something ever comes from nothing so to the limited extent to which the debate between the skeptic and the non-skeptic can be decided on strictly empirical grounds the non-skeptic's position though weak in absolute terms is infinitely stronger than the skeptic's position
but the really important question is whose position is internally coherent the answer to which as we have seen in more than one context is the non-skeptic's position and once this is granted as we have also seen the skeptic cannot hold on to his skepticism without making his position even more incoherent than before
