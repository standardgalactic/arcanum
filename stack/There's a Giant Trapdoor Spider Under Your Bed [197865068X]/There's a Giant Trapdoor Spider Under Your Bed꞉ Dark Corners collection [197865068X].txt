There's a Giant Trapdoor Spider Under Your Bed
From Dark Corners Collection
A collection of Amazon Original Stories

Performed by Amy Landon
The phone buzzed somewhere inside the bundle of Ian's clothes across the room.
Noah looked up from his book.
Are you gonna get that, eventually?
Ian's head popped up from the bed above, upside down,
the only time black curls didn't block his sightline.
Hmm, no, I don't think so.
Which one are you reading?
Noah offered him a glimpse of the spine.
True fans should be able to tell each Harry Potter book apart by thickness only.
Why do y'all Hufflepuffs like Goblet of Fire so much?
Ravenclaw's wouldn't understand.
Noah replied, returning to his reading.
The phone buzzed again with impeccable timing.
He sighed, hearing back at the dark confines of his bedroom,
hardly discerning the pile of clothes by the door.
You know, it could be Sam.
Ian grinned his perfect goofball grin.
You'd like that, wouldn't you?
Seriously?
That's how it's gonna be?
Buzz?
If you don't get it, I'll get it.
No, no, don't get it, Ian said.
It's probably Sam.
I don't want to speak to her.
Then he added, upon Noah's already huge eyes widening at the insinuation of a schism in the pack.
She's been chasing me all day, trying to get me alone, you know?
I feel like she's asking me for something I'm not ready to share with her yet.
What?
Like your third secret Tumblr blog?
Yeah, exactly that.
Buzz.
I'm getting it.
Noah decided, pulling the sheets away.
No, don't.
I gotta pee anyway.
There's a giant trapdoor spider under your bed.
Noah stopped dead.
Like a god had slammed the universe's pause button.
He stayed there for a second, contemplating the hideous mental picture those words had conjured.
His right bare foot hung in midair, inches above the fuzzy carpet.
He gazed up at Ian's inverted face, spying from the upper bunk.
There is, Ian elaborated.
It's dark brown, hard-shelled, hairless.
You know, not the bulbous-bodied, flimsy-limbed kind.
But the sturdy, compact ones with thick legs.
Sort of like a tank with eight knees.
The worst kind.
And it's six feet long, three feet tall.
How does it fit under my bed?
It dug a hole, and if it senses you treading on the carpet, it will jump and snatch you with its four legs and drag you under the bed.
And it will devour you alive in the dark.
It's a fact, now.
There was a deep space silence after that, one that not even the phone dared break.
A silence in which the room, led only by the flashlight Noah was using to read, seemed to nod in agreement with what was spoken.
Grave and appalled.
It's a fact, now.
Quietly, Noah pulled his foot back onto the bed.
He looked up at Ian, who was now shrugging, upside down, so sort of pulling his shoulders down to his head, like this wasn't his fault.
Why would you do something like that?
Noah asked, nonplussed.
Well, you're safe while you stay on your bed.
Oh, great.
So gracious of you.
Do you think it's comfortable sleeping directly above a giant spider?
Separated from it only by a foam mattress?
It's like the sickest thing you could wish for a friend.
It's not even a smart move.
You're trapped in your bunk, too.
Oh, no, I'm not.
The spider can only reach so far.
I can easily jump beyond its leg span from up here.
Well, no, you can't, Noah argued.
You can't, because the shadows in the room are anti-matter, and if you land on them, the atoms in your body will be obliterated instantly, and all that'll be left of you will be a stupid puddle of neutrinos on the floor.
Ian tottened up to survey the room from his watchtower.
The bunk bed stood in the corner against a window, and the full moon, plus the security light outside mesmerizing the moths under the eave, provided ample light on both decks, as well as some of the desktop to the left.
But it cast a slanted labyrinth of gray and black polygons on the floor, meticulously drawn by the bunk bed, the desk chair, a paper bin, Ian's bag, Ian's sneakers, and several other things that he should have put away before going to bed.
It was like his own lovable, chaotic good nature had been turned against him.
Okay, good play, he said, retreating back into his sheets.
Making sure his pillow was under the blessing of the security light.
Congratulations.
I'm not the one who has to go pee anyway.
Fine.
I guess I'll just wet the bed.
Noah complained.
Maybe the spider will move out when it notices the ceiling's leaky.
He waited for Ian's comeback.
But there wasn't one.
A few seconds later, he heard the rustling of sheets above.
Ian going to sleep.
His first intention was to continue reading.
But as he rolled onto his chest again, he became aware of his own belly, just a few inches above the giant trapdoor spider's face.
Or its back.
He didn't know whether the spider would be just lying flat under his bed or burrowed vertically, looking up.
He couldn't possibly read a word like that, with his abdomen suspended a few centimeters above large, venom-dripping chalicera, ready to slice through the skin on his chest as if it were warm butter.
He couldn't see the print on the book.
He couldn't see the book.
All he could see was the mattress beneath him, like a gauzy veil, sparing him the vision of a dark cave beyond, choked with a single, gigantic animal.
Hard and cold and hungry.
He tried lying on his back.
It didn't feel safer.
He sat up against the window with the book on his lap and resting the flashlight on the windowsill.
He wondered what would happen if the wooden slats under his mattress gave way now.
He would fall into the burrow, probably behind the spider.
Maybe the spider was too big to turn around in its hole.
Maybe he would live just long enough to appreciate the inside of a trapdoor spider's lair.
Something moved on the other side of the mattress, the one above.
Hey!
Ian's voice came from the upper deck.
Would you like to come sleep up here?
Noah repressed his first impulsive answer.
Why would I want to be with you now?
Look, I'm sorry about the spider, okay?
I never meant to-
Oh, shit!
Ian shouted, without really catching Noah unprepared.
Because during that em-dash between never meant to and oh shit, something remarkable had happened.
The security light had turned off.
Shit!
Light!
Light!
Noah rushed to grab his flashlight and pointed at the left side of the bed.
Ian was already hanging down, long legs dangling in the air, searching for the edge of the lower bunk, time-stoppingly close to the carpet.
His hands released the rail just as Noah grabbed him and pulled him in, both crashing against the wall.
Shit!
Ah, my hair!
Check my hair!
It's okay!
No, it's on fire!
No, it's okay, Ian!
You're okay!
It only burned through the ends.
I would have felt the gamma radiation.
Noah was holding him by his shoulders, shaking him.
The flashlight only accented the panic in Ian's face.
Freckles flushed off his cheeks by the sheer panic.
You're okay.
Noah soothed him again, remembering then to check the lights outside, or absence thereof.
The power's out.
The power's out?
Ian parroted.
Well, that's no big deal, is it?
It's not like someone decided that the shadows were anti-matter.
Well, the shadows won't last forever, will they?
Because the sun will rise.
How are we gonna get rid of your spider?
What are you doing now?
I'm creating a safe space, Ian replied, reaching out to pull the quilt from his former bed,
then leaning out to tuck it into the edge.
Hold me!
Why do I have to hold you?
Because if you don't hold me and I fall off to bed,
the spider I created will devour me because I'm an idiot.
There!
Happy now?
They fell silent, gawking at each other.
Noah wasn't happy.
At all.
Still, he clutched Ian's waist with both hands,
while Ian tucked the quilt between the bunk and the mattress above.
The quilt hung like a screen,
offering the flashlight's beam a surface to bounce off
and scatter warmly inside their fort.
It didn't add much to the full moon's light,
except for maybe a cozy yellow hue
when combined with the gold-brown of the bedposts.
It felt like the interior of a nest box.
Once he was done,
Ian sat back against the window
and tried raising a hand and waving at the quilt.
The moonlight only cast a blurry shadow,
too dim to mean any danger.
If he did it directly in front of the flashlight,
the shadow was somewhat invigorated.
Noah sat next to him,
wondering whether the extra weight
would be inconveniencing the spider downstairs too much.
Why did you have to make it a spider?
He moaned.
I don't know,
Ian said,
slowly taming his breath.
Don't you like spiders a little?
Oh, it was a present, you mean?
That's nice.
Did you keep the receipt?
No, but seriously,
you kind of like bugs, don't you?
Beetles and stuff?
Yeah, beetles and stuff,
not spiders.
Spiders are monsters.
He wiped his dry mouth.
The full moon illuminated the goosebumps
on the back of his neck.
Do you know
that in the Amazon rainforest,
there are spiders so big
they eat birds?
Like, that's their name.
Bird eaters.
Can you picture it?
A bird being eaten by a huge spider?
Those two animals
are not even in the same league.
It's atrocious.
Well, being eaten
is no one's cup of tea,
I guess.
No,
but especially for a bird.
Being eaten by an overgrown invertebrate,
that's not right, man.
What can eat a human being?
Say,
a tiger.
So, okay,
I get eaten by a tiger.
It's terrible.
It's painful,
but
I look up
and I see the tiger's face.
I see big cat eyes,
a snout,
whiskers.
The long,
sharp fangs
sunk into my flesh
and I understand all that.
I see the features of a hunter.
It's a mammal
feeding on another mammal.
That's logical.
That's the circle of life.
I can accept that.
That's a very zen attitude
toward being eaten by a tiger.
But a bird?
Noah resumed,
unruffled by the commentary.
Imagine,
you're a sweet little bird,
a sparrow or a blue jay.
Maybe a young one,
one who just fell out of the nest
and is learning the mechanics of flight.
And you're hopping along in the thicket
and then out of nowhere,
four hairy arthropod legs
close upon you.
Venomous pincers sink into your chest.
And you look up
and you see that,
that alien face.
The claws concealing the mouth,
no nose,
no ears,
only eight beady eyes.
The dead,
like black orbs with no pupils.
Just dark porthole windows
into that evolutionary excuse for a brain.
Nothing more than some ganglia
knotted into a killer instinct,
unburdened by intelligence or mercy.
And that's the last thing you see
for hours of agony,
hours of a nightmare you can't wake from,
while the alien mouth
vomits digestive enzymes
into your bleeding wounds
before it can start sucking
on your liquefied organs.
He turned to Ian,
both hugging their knees.
Think of that,
he added.
Imagine
if you were born a little bird,
a beautiful bird,
and look me in the eye
and tell me that monsters don't exist.
The night,
the moonlight,
the air felt like ice water,
soaking them to the bone.
Well,
when I hear spider,
I tend to think of a Spider-Man doll
I had when I was in kindergarten.
But that's ruined for me now,
I guess,
Ian said resignedly.
He grabbed Noah's pillow
and squeezed it tight in his arms
while he gazed at the empty
quilt screen before them,
guessing at the outside world
they were not allowed to enjoy anymore.
I'll understand
if you have to wet the bed.
Well,
thank you,
considering it's my friggin' bed.
Okay,
whiny McCrankson,
jeez.
He couldn't stop the joke
before it came out of his mouth.
Someone got up
on the wrong side
of the bed today.
The grin barely flashed
in his face
before he apropos from that.
Wait,
that's a good point.
Just pee over the side
of the bed.
What?
Into the antimatter below?
I'd better not.
But the radiation
would blind us.
Well,
keep your eyes closed.
Or,
if your pee falls close enough,
the spider might bop out
and we'll get a good look at it.
See how big it is.
You said how big it is.
Six feet long,
three feet tall.
Yeah,
but I was only guessing.
It might be smaller.
Look,
if this is one foot...
He measured the distance
between his heel
and his big toe.
Actual feet
are longer than your feet.
Really?
Yeah.
And also,
I should have said this before,
but we won't get
a good look at it
because our eyes
will be closed
so the radiation
doesn't blind us.
Your plans have so many flaws,
I have trouble keeping up.
Gosh,
you're insufferable today.
He sighed.
Okay,
don't pee on the antimatter.
Just taunt the spider
out from under the bed.
You know,
like Harry Potter
in Prisoner of Azkaban.
What?
The part where Harry
stands up on his bed
and starts peeing
over the side?
I must have missed that.
No?
The part where Harry
catches the monster
book of monsters
hiding under his bed
by baiting it
with the shoe
and jumping on it
as it comes snapping out.
I'm not saying
we jump on the side
of the spider,
he reassured Noah.
I'm just saying
we give it a look
and reassess.
Noah considered the plan,
yearning for objections,
his eyes inventorying
the available objects
they could use
instead of a shoe.
There was only
the flashlight,
which was out of the question,
the pillow,
or his copy
of Goblet of Fire.
The pillow is too light.
The spider
may not sense it,
Ian said,
reading his thoughts.
It'll have to be
the Goblet of Fire.
He lifted the quilt screen,
flipping it up
onto the top bunk.
Moonbeams
redrew the room scape,
a shattered pool
of light in the middle,
like a deadly calm
inner sea
in a continent
of shadow.
The boys stood
on their knees
on the edge
of the bed
and leaned over.
There was no sign
of predators,
exactly as the presence
of predators
would indicate.
If it's small enough,
I may jump on it,
Ian announced.
Like,
really small,
though.
Like,
just one footer.
No,
maybe three inches.
He imagined
a regular
trapdoor spider
scuttling out
from under the bed,
like a clueless
old lady
tricked by teenage
pranksters
ringing the doorbell.
He imagined
the sound of it
squishing under
his weight.
Imagine the
crunchy exoskeleton
bursting under
his bare feet,
the feeling of
thick white innards
oozing out
and touching
his soles.
I probably
won't jump
either way.
I thought so,
Noah said,
holding the
goblet of fire
over the carpet,
eyes fixed
on the landing spot.
He barely
noticed Ian
extending a
preemptive arm
in front of him,
grazing his chest
to stop him
from falling forward.
Remember
not to hit
the shadows,
Ian reminded.
Count to three,
okay?
One.
Noah craned
over a little
farther,
managing to get
just a glimpse
of the crawlspace
under the bed.
Two.
He tried to
make out something
in the pitch black
of that space,
the glint
of a dark orb,
the rustle
of petty palps
feeling the air
about them.
Three.
Three.
The book
thudded
on the floor.
The girls
crashed through
the door shouting,
Stay away
from the mirrors!
Stop!
The shadows
are anti-matter!
cried the boys.
Sam and
Rina froze
on the threshold,
Rina quickly
retracting a
peppermint-striped
socked foot
that had almost
trodden
into the room.
Mirrors!
Sam repeated.
Are there
any mirrors here?
The boys
scanned the room
like they had
to make sure.
No.
Good,
because the
mirror people
are rebelling.
If you pass
a mirror,
your reflection
will try
to kill you.
Okay.
Noah agreed
as he factored
that into
their own scenario.
No risk
of that here,
but you can't
touch the shadows.
They will
disintegrate you.
Right,
Rina nodded,
reckoning the length
of the shadow
stripe ahead.
We can jump
onto the chair
and roll
all the way
to the bed.
We'll take
my bunk.
No,
you can't
take the upper
bunk.
It's flooded
with antimatter,
Noah told her,
and he could
immediately feel
his sister's glare,
lit only by the
window at the
end of the
hallway.
I offer you
boys my bed
for the night,
and you flood
it with antimatter?
Rina said
icily.
It was an
accident.
Why do you
think Ian's
in my bunk?
How can
you have
an accident
involving
antimatter?
Asked Sam.
Look,
it's a long
story,
okay?
Ian deflected.
We're dealing
with some
serious shit
here.
You're dealing
with some
serious shit?
I almost
got killed
by my
reflection
in the
bathroom.
Oh,
big surprise,
a Gryffindor
making everything
about herself.
Well,
I did
ask for
help,
but I guess
Ravenclaws are
too charmingly
quirky to
answer their
texts right
away.
At that
moment,
somewhere,
somehow,
something made
of glass
broke.
The girls
peeked outside
into the
dark end
of the
hallway.
Oh,
my God,
whispered Rina.
She's
inside.
Who?
Noah asked.
Just let
us in.
She's on
the stairs.
Who is
she?
Rina stuttered.
There was
no one-word
answer,
but they
did not
need it.
In the
next blank
second,
all four
could distinctly
hear the
familiar creaking
of a step
in the
stairs.
They all
listened,
and a second
step creaked,
and a third,
virtually at the
same time.
The boys
looked at the
girls,
wondering,
the girls
looked at
the boys,
knowing.
Then three
steps creaked
at the same
time.
Sam,
crystal blue
eyes striking
the perfect
balance between
supplication and
threat,
whispered,
Let us
in.
Okay,
I got you,
I got you.
Hold me,
Ian instructed
Noah,
while he picked
up the flashlight
again.
With his free
hand,
he clung to
the upper
bed,
then tiptoed
on the edge
of the lower
one,
his noodle
figure hanging
out like a
pirate on a
ship's rigging.
With Noah
clutching his
waist,
he craned the
flashlight overhead
and spotlit the
floor in front of
the girls.
Quick,
step in!
Sam strode in to
the light disc.
The soles of her
feet tingled with
the remnants of
positrons lingering
on the tuft like
static electricity.
Rina joined
her,
clinging to
Sam's shoulders,
and with her
foot,
she slammed
the door shut.
The steps
outside fell
silent.
The almost
imperceptible
shake in
Ian's hand
translated into
an unsettling
quiver of the
spotlight.
He took a
deep breath,
commanding his
pulse to
steady.
Okay,
just walk
slowly.
I'm gonna
light your
way to the
corner of
the disc.
He felt
Noah tightening
his grip on
him,
reassuring him.
I'm starting
now.
He slowly
tilted the
light toward
the left,
as slowly as
the turning
cogs inside
a wristwatch
guiding the
second hand.
The light
eyelet on the
floor slid
gently toward
the desk.
Sam and
Rina paced
along in
slow motion,
each naked
foot landing
on the
foremost edge
of the disc
and rising
again just
a split
second before
the encircling
shadow caught
up with
them.
You're good,
Ian encouraged
them.
Careful
with the
chair.
You're fine.
Something
banged on
the door.
The door,
the room,
the universe
jolted.
Noah jolted
and shrieked.
Ian shrieked,
dropped the
flashlight.
The girl
shrieked and
sprang off the
carpet in the
nanosecond before
the shadows
flushed over
it.
Sam clambering
onto the
desk to
the left,
Rina mounting
the office
chair in
the middle
of the
room,
her impetus
pushing it
a few
inches closer
to the
bed.
Who's out
there?
Noah shouted.
It's her,
Sam said.
Who the hell
is her?
Who do you
think got the
power?
Ian wasn't
part of the
argument as he
was still
leaning out,
busy searching
for the lost
flashlight.
It had
rolled halfway
between the
desk and
the bed,
on the
very edge
of the
moonlight
pool.
And it
wasn't
working.
Something
banged on
the door
again.
Not banged,
rather,
bumped.
Harder than
a knock,
but softer
than a slam.
Sam turned
back to
Noah,
eyes now
fully melted
into supplication.
Please,
let us on
your bunk.
Okay,
said Noah.
Can you
jump from
there?
I don't
think so.
Wait,
I got a
better idea,
Ian offered,
shimmying
toward the
foot of
the bed,
to try
to lift
the bunk
ladder
with his
one free
arm.
He drove
it toward
the head
of the
bed and
offered
the lower
end to
Sam.
There was
a new
bump
on the
door.
What is
she banging
with?
Noah dared
ask.
Rina
answered.
Her
head.
Ian
tried not
to listen
as he
wedged
the ladder's
hooks into
the bed
frame above.
It was
only six
rungs
long,
just
enough
to bridge
the gap
between
the desk
and the
upper
bunk.
Okay,
just come
this way,
he invited
Sam.
And
can you
try and
retrieve
the
flashlight
while
you're
at
it?
Bump
and a
sort
of
crunch
added.
That
made
everybody
wince.
Sam
swallowed
a lump
in her
throat,
gripped
the first
rung,
and shifted
her weight
on it.
Doesn't
she hurt
herself?
Noah
whimpered,
eyes fixed
on the
door.
Rina,
clinging to
the back
of the
office
chair,
scowled
at him.
Wanna
open
the door
and offer
her a
band-aid?
Sam
was now
in the
middle
of the
bridge.
She
could
see the
flashlight
down there
between
the third
and fourth
rungs.
Bump!
She swung
off the
side of
the bridge
and hung
upside down
underneath.
Everybody
held their
breath as
she curled
her legs
around the
third rung
and her
hands
released the
rails.
Her long
hair hung
rocking half
an inch
away from
the floor.
She stretched
a hand
and fished
up the
flashlight.
And then
she happened
to look into
the crawl
space under
the bed.
bump.
Oh my
God!
What is
that
thing?
Come up!
Noah
ordered.
Come up!
Who the
hell put
that spider
in there?
She cursed
as she held
onto the
rungs again
and speed
monkey
barred
onto the
bunk
with the
boys.
Who the
hell?
Are you
two
nuts?
Ian
turned to
Rena now.
she was
still on
the
chair
on her
knees
safely
lit
by
the
full
moon
but
way
too
close
to
the
bed
for
comfort.
Rena
whatever
you do
don't
put a
toe
on the
floor
he warned.
Who
the
hell
put
that
spider
in
there?
She
rocked
her body
to rotate
the chair
toward
the
left.
She
was
only
a few
feet
from
the
desk.
I
can
jump.
The
chair
will
roll
out
from
under
your
feet
Noah
said.
If
it
rolls
into
the
shadow
it
will
disintegrate.
Yeah
but I
won't
be
on
it.
The
wardrobe
is
in
the
shadows
and
it
didn't
disintegrate
Sam
objected.
Rena
carefully
planted
her feet
on the
cushioned
seat
and
straightened
her
knees.
Bump.
She
was
standing
at
her
full
height
four
feet
nine
inches
on
a
wheeled
office
chair.
No
one
on
the
bed
dared
breathe
lest
the
exhaled
air
push
her
off
balance.
I'm
gonna
do
it.
Rena
please
don't
fall
Ian
begged.
She
aimed
toward
the
desk
feet
firmly
dug
in
the
cushion
and
started
gently
rocking
her
body
back
and
forth
then
a
little
harder
all
the
while
focusing
her
strength
on
her
legs
her
heels
her
toes
keeping
the
chair
nailed
to
the
ground
while
she
achieved
maximum
momentum.
One
two
she
jumped
the
chair
rolled
in the
opposite
direction
as she
kicked
off
but
she
had
landed
almost
gracefully
on the
tabletop
before
the
chair
entered
the
shadow
zone
unharmed
and
smashed
into
the
wardrobe.
The
impact
made
one of
the
doors
open
a
crack
and
the
springs
helped
it
open
more
creaking
all
the
way
and
the
full
moon
waved
at
them
on
the
inside
of
the
door.
Mirror
Rena
yelled
immediately
hopping
on
two
rungs
of
the
bridge
and
diving
onto
the
bed
crashing
into
Sam
and
Noah.
Don't
look at
the
mirror
don't
let
it
look
at
you.
But
they
couldn't
help
it.
They
couldn't
shift
away.
The
door
kept
swinging
open
showing
the
foot
of
the
bed
and
Ian's
right
arm
and
Ian's
right
arm
a
moonlit
sickly
gray
ragged
version
of
Ian's
right
arm
stuck
out
of
the
mirror
fingers
clinging
to
the
wardrobe
door.
Real
Ian
pulled
the
quilt
screen
into
place
and
fell
back
with
the
others
in
a
bundle
of
limbs
screaming
in
terror.
Light!
Ian
shouted
over
the
others.
Noah!
Light!
It
doesn't
work!
Noah
screamed
slapping
the bottom
of the
flashlight.
The
moonbeam
sneaking
over
the
upper
bunk
was
now
blasting
off
the
mirror
and
back
lighting
the
screen
before
them.
And
behind
it,
they could
make out
the
shadow,
Ian's
reflection
shadow,
lurching
toward the
bed,
exactly
like
Ian,
the
lanky figure,
the puffed
up curls
bouncing with
every sick
lull of the
head.
Everybody
recoiled,
compressing
themselves into
the corner.
Noah
lied!
Noah slammed
the flashlight
against the
bedpost.
It
blinked
on.
He
aimed it
at the
quilt
screen,
and Ian
hand-shadowed
a dog's
head.
The dog
shadow
snapped at
mirror Ian's
shadow,
and mirror Ian
screeched at
the antimatter
burn,
its bright
flack splitting
the darkness
like a strike
of lightning.
Ian even
faked the
barks as
the dog
shadow
charged,
biting off
chunks of
mirror Ian's
shape,
unraveling the
atomic structure
of its body
in a few
seconds,
each bite
accompanied by
whip cracks
of blinding
light and
the piercing
screams of
the creature
disintegrating
into bursts
of energy
and zero
charge
elementary
particles.
After the
last flash
of light,
only Ian's
hand shadow
remained on
the screen.
The audience
panted.
Is that
all?
Bump.
The children
jumped again,
the paws
after their
collective
yip,
allowing them
to appreciate
the sound
qualities of
that last
bump.
Its
consistency,
its texture,
its hint
of crumbling
wood or
bone.
What does
she want?
Ian repeated.
Nobody knows,
Rina explained.
She just
stands outside
people's doors
in the dark
and she bangs
her head on
them.
Bump.
Nobody who
has had any
further
interaction with
her has
lived to
tell the
tale,
Sam added.
Noah asked,
How did
those who
lived to
tell the
tale deal
with her?
They
didn't.
Their doors
just held.
Bump.
She actually
has an
interesting
backstory,
Rina expanded,
brushing the
hair off her
face.
something
involving a
psychiatric
hospital in
the 19th
century.
But when
you think
it's going
to be the
typical story
of a
desperate
mother losing
a long
sought
child,
it turns
out it's
not,
because a
strong female
character
doesn't need
her story to
revolve around
motherhood.
Oh,
cool,
Ian appreciated.
So it's
not just
your regular
Slytherin
evil shit,
it's woke
Slytherin
evil shit.
Excuse
me?
Rina
complained.
Hashtag
not all
Slytherins,
Mr.
I'm gonna
sprinkle the
room with
antimatter
just for
a laugh.
Wrong,
smartass.
The
antimatter
was his
idea.
Mine
was the
trapdoor
spider.
How does
a trapdoor
spider catch
its prey?
Wondered
Sam.
Her voice
sounded
strangely
soft between
the others
quarreling.
Bump.
I mean,
I get it.
It ambushes
it.
But how
does it
keep focused
while it
waits for
the prey
to come
near?
It can
be hours.
That's an
amazing
attention span.
If I
were a
trapdoor
spider,
I would
be like,
oh shit,
was that a
cricket outside
just now?
Damn,
and I was
thinking of
sexy scenarios
with Tom
Hiddleston.
Ian and
Rina couldn't
find anything
to say.
Noah said
something.
Bobbing up
from his
own thoughts.
It's a
boggart.
The other
three turned
toward him.
The lady
outside bumped
the door
again.
She was
already deep
background
now.
A what?
Sam asked.
Like,
in Harry
Potter?
Noah explained.
A creature
that takes
the form
of whatever
terrifies you
most.
Think about
it.
The
trapdoor
spider is
custom-made
to terrify
me.
The
antimatter
is for
you because
you're the
ultimate
nerd.
Right,
Ian agreed,
the thought
of challenging
that claim
not even
crossing his
mind,
and he
turned to
Rina.
The
headbanging
lady is
your
nemesis
because
that's
some
twisted
shit.
Yeah,
she admitted
it and
pointed
at Sam.
And
yours
is the
mirror
people
because
you
Gryffindors
have a
vanity
problem.
No,
we don't.
Okay,
they're all
boggards,
Ian summed
up.
So what?
They can
still kill
us.
But you
can neutralize
a boggart
easily with
the ridiculous
spell,
Noah reminded
them.
You just
think of
something that
causes you
hilarity instead
of fear,
and the
boggart
will turn
into that.
Right,
said Sam.
Does anyone
have a
wand?
Ian showed
his empty
hands.
I'm in
my
jammies.
Me too,
Rina said.
And if I
were in
my dress,
it doesn't
have pockets
either.
So once
again,
thank you,
patriarchy.
Our
wands are
back in
the garden
where we
left them,
Noah muttered,
looking out
the window.
We'll have
to drop
down from
here.
Four
faces stuck
to the
glass of
a second
floor
window on
a dark
suburban
street.
Beyond
the glass,
they saw
a strip
of sloped
roof above
the side
porch,
then the
quiet lawn,
way too
far down.
It's
suicide,
Rina said.
We could
use the
ladder,
Ian offered.
Too
short,
Sam said.
But we
can take
the
mattress
from the
upper
bunk
and throw
it ahead
of us.
She shrugged,
querying the
others.
It will
stop the
fall,
somewhat.
There's
another
problem,
Noah hated
to point
out.
We can't
open the
window from
here.
The latch
is all
the way
up.
Someone
has to
climb on
the upper
bunk.
But it's
almost
completely
in the
dark,
Ian
reported.
There's
only a
square
of
light.
And the
mirror
will
see
us,
Sam
added.
Whoever
leaves
the
safe
space,
their
reflection
will
jump
out
and
try
to
kill
them.
Okay,
then you
go,
Rina
told
Ian.
Noticing
she'd
struck
the
others
as a
little
too
blunt,
she
explained.
We
just
destroyed
his
reflection.
Oh,
right,
Ian
nodded.
Wait,
does that
mean I
can't
see
myself
in a
mirror
ever
again?
How
will
I
shave?
You've
never
shaved.
Well,
I have
plans.
A
particularly
loud bump
on the
door,
one conjuring
a strikingly
vivid image
of something
splintering,
called them
back to
attention.
Look,
we'll deal
with your
puberty
later.
Just go
open the
latch,
before she
breaks down
the door,
Rina
ordered.
And
beware
the
antimatter,
Noah
reminded
him.
And
the
spider,
Sam
contributed.
God,
why do
we even
have
sleepovers
anymore?
Ian
moaned as
he crawled
to the
head of
the bed.
I'm
too old
for this
shit.
Rina
held the
curtain
open for
him,
while Sam
offered him
the flashlight.
Noah
was on
his knees
on the
pillow,
ready to
hold him.
Don't,
Ian
told him.
Your
hands
could
reflect
in
the
mirror.
Bump.
He
put the
end of
the
flashlight
in his
mouth,
grabbed
the
edge
of
the
upper
bunk,
and
leaned
outside.
His
face
tilted
towards
something
on the
other
side
of
the
privacy
curtain.
He
jerked
away,
grimacing.
What?
Asked
Noah.
Ian
took
the
flashlight
out
of
his
mouth.
Nothing,
he
lied.
I
just
learned
how
I
would
look
if
half
my
body
underwent
nuclear
fission
and
the
other
half
lay
fried
in
the
resulting
radiation.
Bump.
He shook
his head,
trying to
expel the
lingering
image.
Okay,
here I
go.
He bit
on the
flashlight
again and
pulled
himself up.
They saw
his feet
scurry up
and then
follow his
movements on
the mattress
above.
Can
you
reach
the
latch?
Noah
asked.
They
heard a
moan that
they all
wanted to
interpret as
an
uh-huh.
Then
some more
fumbling,
some knees
steadying,
then a
bump,
then a
clack
near the
window,
then an
oh
shit.
The
flashlight
came
clattering
down between
the window
and the
bed,
dead.
The
weight of
Ian
scrambled
against
the
wall.
Shit,
I'm
trapped
up here,
it's
too
narrow,
I'm
burning,
I'm
burning.
Ian,
the
mattress,
Sam
screamed,
lift
the
mattress.
All
three
gaped
in awe
as they
saw the
roof of
the fort
being
literally
peeled
open as
Ian
wedged
himself
under
the
mattress
and
kicked
it
off
the
bed
and
out
of
the
equation,
hands
clawing
at the
wooden
slats
of
the
bed
base,
his
face
haloed
by the
blazing
ends
of
his
curls.
Help
me,
help
me.
The
other
sprang
into
action
and
power
punched
the
middle
of
a
slat
until
it
snapped,
the
crack
coinciding
in
time
with
an
awful
bump
from
the
door,
and
Ian
squeezed
in
through
the
gap,
screaming
all
the
way,
landing
head
first
inside
the
fort.
Noah
and
Sam
and
Rena
dumped
the
bed
sheets
on
top
of
him.
We
got
you,
we
got
you,
Noah
assured
him,
trying to
appease
the
thrashing
bulk
under
the
blankets
while
the
girls
slapped
it
to
put
out
the
fires.
Ian,
calm
down,
we
got
you.
Noah
pulled
the
blankets
off.
Ian
looked
back
at
him,
tears
in his
eyes,
smoke
billowing
off
his
hair,
hands
frantically
checking
the
atomic
integrity
of
his
body.
You're
okay,
Noah
soothed
him,
clutching
his
wrists.
You're
okay,
we're
all
okay.
The
door
bumped
them
back
to
their
grim
reality.
Sam
and
Rena
scrambled
to
the
window
and
pulled
up
the
sash.
A
cold
breeze
blew
in,
reminding
them
their
clothes
were
soaked
in
sweat.
All
four
peeked
outside
into
the
mockingly
peaceful
night.
Right,
Noah
said,
so now
someone
has to
jump
outside,
take
their
wand,
hit
the
circuit
breaker
switch,
that
should
deal
with
the
antimatter
and
the
lady
outside,
and
come
up
here
to
cast
the
ridiculous
spell
on
the
spider.
You
mean,
Sam
corrected
him,
someone
has to
jump
outside,
and
then
do
all
that
on
two
broken
legs.
Yeah,
most
likely.
They
contemplated
the
garden
down
below,
beyond
the
porch
roof,
all
of
them
instinctively
caressing
their own
calves,
pondering
for the
first
time how
nice
their legs
looked
with the
bones
kept
strictly
inside.
Bump.
Noah,
as the
host,
felt compelled
to forward
a suggestion.
rock,
paper,
scissors?
They
shifted to
form a
circle,
girl facing
girl and
boy facing
boy,
all sitting
in lotus,
each one's
toes touching
two other
people's toes.
They hid
their hands
behind their
backs.
Bump.
They
contemplated the
garden down
below,
all of them
instinctively
caressing their
own calves,
pondering for
the first
time,
how nice
their legs
looked with
the bones
kept strictly
inside.
On the
count of
three,
Rina said,
wondering if
her giving
the signal
would actually
warrant her
any advantage.
She checked
Ian's face,
then Sam's,
then Noah's,
the exact
equal of her
own.
He should be
the easiest
to read.
He'd always
been the least
capable of
trickery.
could she
actually read
rock or
paper or
scissors in
his expression
if she
squinted
hard enough?
And if she
did,
would it be
what he
planned to
draw or
what he
wanted her
to believe
he'd draw?
One?
Wait,
Ian said.
What if
we let
the lady
in,
but she
sees herself
in the
mirror,
so the
reflection
will kill
her,
and then
we'll have
to deal
with her
reflection
anyway,
right?
No,
stupid
idea,
sorry.
Everyone
puffed,
sighed,
rolled their
eyes.
Rina privately
tried to
command her
fingers to
settle on a
shape without
her own
face revealing
which.
To?
I'm not
into Sam,
you know,
Noah said
to Ian.
I'm into
you.
The girls
looked at
Ian,
then at
each other.
They had
both suspected
it.
Ian didn't
have a clue,
of course,
but it was
far from the
greatest shocker
of the night.
I love
you,
Noah told
him,
and all
you do is
put giant
trapdoor
spiders under
my bed
and set
yourself on
fire and
come up
with asinine
plans.
And yet,
I love
you anyway.
Ian shrugged
Ianly.
Thanks,
he said.
Three!
Four fists
met at the
center of the
circle.
Three whole
fists really
tightly balled
into solid
rocks,
all looming
over the
one rickety
scissor.
Noah looked
up from his
own two
betraying
fingers
into Ian's
eyes in
front of
him.
They were
big and
black,
and his
beautiful
curls tried
so hard
to hide
them.
But they
were looking
back,
so heart-wrenchingly
guilty.
Okay,
Noah whispered.
You guys
pray for me.
He started
withdrawing his
hand.
No one else
did.
In fact,
Rena still
couldn't take
her eyes off
the result.
Sam,
she said,
a suspicious
frown on her
face.
Why are you
playing with
your left
hand?
The boys
looked at the
three fists
between them.
Rena's right,
Ian's right,
Sam's left.
They checked
Sam's face.
Her chin
trembled,
stuck on a
syllable.
Rena said,
The bathroom
mirror.
It got you.
There was a
split second
in which all
three noticed
it.
Sam's silky
features,
the minute
accidental
additions and
subtractions
embellishing the
symmetry of her
perfect face,
reversed.
But that was
all before it
contorted into
an ear-splitting
scream,
crystal blue
irises rolling
back into her
skull,
claws reaching
to tear the
boys' faces
off.
Rena uncurled
her legs and
kangaroo kicked
her off the bed
through the
quilt screen.
Mirror Sam
landed flat on
the carpet,
on the moonlit
area,
right next to
the goblet of
fire.
And the giant
trapdoor spider
jumped from under
the bunk bed,
larger than
Ian's wildest
guess,
uglier than
Noah's most
feverish nightmares,
forelegs like
colossal robot
phalanges closing
around its prey,
bodies so vast,
pincers so huge,
eyes and brains
so evilly small,
that it lifted the
bunk bed and
tilted it back.
And the three
other kids rolled
out of the window
away from
Mirror Sam's
scream as it
went from
feral malice
to unbelieving
terror.
Ian grasped
the gutter
before he fell
off the roof,
and Rena clung
to his shirt,
and Noah managed
to grab one of
them just long
enough to slow
the fall and
land painfully
but whole onto
the ground,
his bones
vibrating with
the impact,
but barely
protesting any
further when
Rena and Ian
dropped on top
of him.
His legs
hardly resisted
when Ian
pulled him
up,
and all three
stumbled to
the garden
where they
had been
playing all
afternoon,
picked up
their wands,
kicked open
the front door,
slapped the
circuit breaker
switch back on,
rushed up the
stairs,
ran to the
end of the
brightly lit
corridor,
swung open
the blood-stained
door,
swished their
wands,
and cried,
RIDICULOUS!
When Noah and
Rena's parents
finally got up
and stormed in
to check the
ruckus in the
kids' room,
they found
Noah,
Rena,
and Ian
standing waist
deep in a
pile of some
50,000 tiny
Spider-Man dolls.
A second
later,
Sam bobbed up
from the pile,
gasping for
oxygen.
Little friendly
neighborhood
superheroes
tangled in
her hair.
