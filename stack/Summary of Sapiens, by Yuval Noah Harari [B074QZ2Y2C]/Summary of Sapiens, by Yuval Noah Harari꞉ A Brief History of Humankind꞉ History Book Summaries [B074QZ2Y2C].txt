This is a Flashbooks Audio Summary on
Sapiens, A Brief History of Humankind.
Written and published by GetFlashbooks.com
Narrated by Dean Bukhari
Original author, Yuval Noah Harari
Our species, Homo sapiens, started out as just another biologically insignificant animal among countless others,
but at some point made a very quick jump to domination over other species that has left humankind anxious, destructive, and often miserable despite all of our efforts to be happy.
Yuval Noah Harari's book, Sapiens, traces the origins, mechanisms, and effects of what we think of as human progress from small bands of hunter-gatherers 100,000 years ago
to the present-day global network through which our species has come to dominate the entire Earth.
This bird's-eye view of human history delves into the development of sapien social organization
and the structural features of human cultures through which our species has spread, replicated, and evolved,
including the breakthroughs of human language with its infinite expressions, the use of the human imagination,
and the rise of the concept of a better future that lies just beyond the horizon.
Through these mechanisms, our species has evolved socially rather than biologically,
which is a first, into a species that's increasingly in control of our own destiny.
And we are the only species on Earth that can do that.
To evolve socially rather than biologically.
To be in control of things like making plans, and controlling or trying to control the future, our destiny.
Now this book considers not only how this evolution has occurred, but questions of whether this progress has actually been beneficial,
and how we might, with our awareness of how we got here, decide where we want to go.
Here's what we'll talk about specifically in this book summary.
First, we'll talk about how although sapiens have not evolved biologically in 100,000 years,
we have indeed experienced radical evolutions in the social order driven by our ability to collectively imagine and plan for the future.
We'll talk about how history overall is moving in the direction of global unity of humankind.
And we'll talk about how none of the outcomes of history have been inevitable.
And the flexible nature of the social order may mean that our species can control its destiny.
A quick tweetable summary to encapsulate this book in a nutshell.
The 70,000 years of social progress experienced by homo sapiens may not have been good for us,
but there's no turning back now.
A few crucial quotes before we dive in to the big ideas.
We study history not to know the future, but to widen our horizons,
to understand that our present situation is neither neutral nor inevitable,
and that we, consequently, have many more possibilities before us than we imagine.
The feedback loop between science, empire, and capital has arguably been history's chief engine for the past 500 years.
Any attempt to define the characteristics of modern society is akin to defining the color of a chameleon,
the only characteristic of which, we can be certain, is incessant change.
Big idea number one.
Our species, homo sapiens, was once just one of several human species and was not particularly dominant among large mammals.
Harari tells us, from the very beginning of the book,
that one of the most important things to keep in mind about our prehistoric human ancestors is
that they were relatively insignificant.
In fact, prehistoric humans didn't have any more of an impact on their environment than jellyfish or gorillas.
So, how the heck did we evolve into where we are today?
The species homo sapiens is one of the genus homo,
of which there were once a number of other species all now extinct,
many of which existed simultaneously here on Earth.
These other human species evolved just as we did from a common ancestor.
Humans, and in particular sapiens,
first differentiated from other mammalian species by developing very large brains,
which take a lot of energy to fuel.
Humans were also different in that they walked upright on two legs.
These two physical factors contributed heavily to the development of humankind's unique social abilities,
as well as its problems,
including the relatively premature birth of offspring compared to other animals
and, as a result, the long period of time they must stay under the care of adults
before they can become independent,
which has meant a very long period of socialization of the young.
Now, the need to support such a large brain and cranial cavity to house it
left sapiens relatively weak physically compared with other large mammals.
Up until 70,000 years ago, the human species, including sapiens,
remained somewhere in the middle of the food chain as both predator and prey,
with no dominion or significant advantage over other animals.
What they lacked in domination, however,
they made up for in leisure and ease of life,
as the work of gathering food did not generally consume the entire day.
Although sapiens were spread over a large area of the Eurasian landmass,
they were spread very thinly, in small bands that were isolated and independent.
Women nursed each new baby for a few years
and therefore would take measures to prevent having a new baby
before one was at least three years old.
Childhood mortality rates were low,
as there were almost no childhood diseases to speak of back then,
and infectious diseases in general were also rare.
The secret of sapiens' success was their varied diet.
They ate all sorts of different foods.
They foraged not only for food,
but for knowledge about the growth cycles
and locations of various food sources.
For bands to survive back then,
and individual sapiens needed to have
an extraordinary range of personal knowledge
and skills as well as physical prowess.
Big idea number two.
Although sapiens has not evolved biologically for 100,000 years,
it began a radical process of social revolution
around 70,000 years ago
in what is known today as the Cognitive Revolution,
a social development that enabled sapiens
to spread across the world
and achieve biological domination.
Quote,
Sapiens can cooperate in extremely flexible ways
with countless numbers of strangers.
That's why sapiens rule the world,
whereas ants eat our leftovers
and chimps are locked up in zoos
and research laboratories.
Unquote.
At some point,
sapiens began a rapid
and ever-accelerating ascent
to biological domination,
aided by the development of large brains,
a very long period of socialization for the young,
and a complex language system
capable of an infinite range of expressions,
sapiens,
through their ability
to imagine,
both individually and collectively,
developed sets of shared stories,
myths,
and beliefs
that helped them organize
and cooperate
more effectively
and in larger numbers.
A few factors
seem to have contributed to this.
An important factor
in the development
of larger brains
was probably
the domestication
of fire
by which humans
could render food
much more quickly
to eat and digest
as well as safer
and also manipulate
the physical environment
to its advantage
in a way
that no other animal could.
Now,
because sapiens
could ingest
and digest food
more quickly,
its brain
was actually able
to grow
larger and larger,
precipitating
this cognitive revolution.
Now,
the cognitive revolution
helped sapiens,
our species,
cooperate
in larger and larger numbers
and share vital information
within their own bands
and with nearby bands
forming loose tribes.
It also allowed
for rapid innovation
in social behavior
as well as
the invention
and dissemination
of technology,
the first of these being
bows and arrows
and oil lamps,
boats and sewing needles
to fashion warm clothes
that allowed them
to penetrate
colder environments.
With the aid
of their new inventions,
sapiens then spread rapidly
over the Eurasian continent
starting about 70,000 years ago.
Now,
as sapiens spread,
other human species,
including the Neanderthals,
went extinct.
Now,
it's unclear
exactly why
they went extinct,
but some argue
that sapiens,
although a separate species
from other humans,
were able to produce
fertile offspring with them
and that the species merged.
Others believe
that the dominance
of sapiens
drove other human species
like the Neanderthals
to complete extinction.
Now,
the theory that sapiens
merged with other human species
in various regions
of the Eurasian continent
gives support to the idea
that there are
significant biological differences
between human races,
an idea that's led
to controversial
and perhaps dangerous
ideological conclusions,
including that of
Nazi racial ideology.
What is clear, though,
is that as sapiens spread
across Eurasia,
then to Australia
and the Pacific
and to the Americas,
other large animal species
quickly went extinct
and sapiens ascended
to the top of the food chain
in what is known
as the first wave extinction.
Long before he invented
the wheel,
writing or iron tools,
sapiens wiped out
about half of the planet's
large animal species.
Big idea number three.
The great lesson
of the agricultural revolution
is the discrepancy
between evolutionary success
and individual suffering.
Quote,
This is the essence
of the agricultural revolution,
the ability to keep
more people alive
under worse conditions.
Unquote.
About 10,000 years ago,
sapiens began actively
manipulating plants,
or, as some might see it,
plants began actively
manipulating us.
Sapiens began laboring
to tend to the needs
of a handful
of very specific plants,
the first being wheat
and other grains,
which it previously gathered
as wild grasses,
forming permanent settlements
around this activity.
The advantage of this,
supposedly,
was to be able to feed
a larger number of people
and gain food security
by controlling,
concentrating,
and storing the food source.
Unfortunately,
grain cultivation
came with a host
of drawbacks,
including
an increased labor load
for sapiens
and a less varied diet
that ill-suited
the sapiens' body.
Concentrated agricultural
settlements
also gave rise
to infectious diseases
among sapiens
whose less varied diets
meant weaker immune systems
and an increase
in human violence
as they competed
for arable land
and raided
and protected grain stores.
Rates of childhood mortality
soared
with the spread
of childhood diseases
and increased
frequency of birth,
with small children
increasingly
eating grain
rather than
mother's milk
early on in life,
thus weakening
their immune systems.
Sapiens
had fallen
all the way back then
into
a luxury
trap
in which
a luxury,
i.e.
surplus grain stores,
becomes a necessity
and then
brings with it
added obligations,
i.e.
cultivating
and storing grain.
From an evolutionary
standpoint,
the agricultural
revolution
was a success
in that
it resulted
in higher birth rates
and therefore
more replication
of DNA copies,
but
from the standpoint
of individual
quality of life,
it was a disaster.
One of the effects
of the agricultural
revolution
was the development
of hierarchical
societies
in which
peasants
spend their
lives
laboring
to produce
food surpluses
that feed
a tiny elite
of kings,
government officials,
priests,
soldiers,
artists,
and thinkers.
Along with
new transportation
technology,
this enabled
them
to gather
into denser
settlements
and eventually
cities,
all connected
by commercial
networks
within
ever-growing
kingdoms,
which in turn
enabled the
rapid spread
and continued
innovation
in shared
mythologies
upon which
social orders
were built
and maintained.
Another significant
outcome of
the agricultural
revolution,
Harari tells us,
was the birth
of the concept
of the future
as it became
necessary to
start thinking
about and
predicting the future,
things like
weather patterns,
storage of grain
for the future,
etc.
And it also
became possible
to do something
about it
in the form
of sowing
more crops,
building irrigation
canals,
and other
machinery,
etc.
The future
was yet another
imaginary concept
that would become
crucial in the
development of
our social
and economic
systems.
Big idea
number four.
Sapiens
use the power
of shared
fictions,
the ability
to think
and talk
about what
is not
real
and invent
stories
as a force
for organization
and cooperation
through imagined
orders of
ever-increasing
complexity.
Maintenance
of this
social order
requires a
network
of artificial
instincts
to which
we are
programmed
from birth
which we
call
culture.
Quote,
Yet none
of these
things
exists
outside
the stories
that people
invent
and tell
one another.
There are
no gods
in the
universe,
no nations,
no money,
no human
rights,
no laws,
and no justice
outside the
common
imagination
of human
beings.
Unquote.
Beginning
with the
cognitive
revolution,
sapiens
began to
evolve
socially
away
from their
biological
design
through a
series of
social
innovations
that
radically
changed
the
shape
of
sapiens
daily
reality.
This
social
evolution
has been
driven
by sets
of
shared
fictions
or
mythologies
upon
which
imagined
social
orders
are
built.
The
imagined
social
order
is
intersubjective,
meaning
it exists
within the
network
of
communications
between
individuals
subjective
subconscious.
Harari
tells us
that
these
imagined
social
orders,
such as
India's
caste
system
or
the
western
liberal
concept
of
human
rights,
have
shifted
form
as
they've
been
based
on
changing
myths.
The
imagined
order
can only
be
maintained
if
everyone
believes
it.
This
requires
an
insistence
that
the
imagined
order
is
actually
an
objective
reality
created
by the
gods
or
by
nature.
The
imagined
order
is
embedded
into
the
material
world
and
shapes
individual
desires.
And
what
people
want
is
programmed
by
their
belief
in
the
ideologies
that
maintain
the
imagined
order,
such as
romanticism
or
consumerism.
This
imagined
order
is
inescapable.
To
stop
believing
in one,
we must
start
believing
in another
more
powerful
one.
Harari
tells us
that
in
order
to
maintain
a
social
order,
hierarchies
are
a
necessary
evil.
Patriarchy,
as one
form of
hierarchy,
has been
the norm
in almost
all
industrial
societies,
and it's
not clear
why.
The
biological
explanations
seem to
break down
upon closer
examination.
The
laws,
norms,
rights,
and obligations
we attach
to the
ideas of
man and
woman
are almost
entirely
products of
the human
imagination
rather than
a biological
reality.
This is
why cultural
femininity
and masculinity
must be
constantly
and
vigilantly
defended
and maintained.
While the
norms and
morals or
values of
cultures
often claim
to forbid
that which
is unnatural,
by definition
anything that
is possible
is natural.
The major
difference
between
nature
and culture
is that
while
biology
allows,
culture
forbids.
Cultures
are in
constant
flux
as they
attempt
to resolve
the inherent
contradictions
in their
imperatives,
for example,
the contradiction
between the
ideologies of
social equality
and individual
liberty
in western
liberalism.
The effort
to resolve
these contradictions
is the
engine,
Harari tells
us,
that drives
the evolution
of human
culture.
Cultures
are a
sort of
mental
parasite.
According
to
memetics,
cultural
evolution
has been
based on
the replication
of memes,
which are
the basic
building blocks
of culture.
According
to
post-modernism,
discourses
rather than
memes
are the
basic units
of culture.
In either
case,
cultures
spread and
evolve as
these units
self-replicate.
Big idea
number five,
the dominant
religion of
our emerging
global culture
is probably
syncretism.
Quote,
monotheism,
as it has
played out
in history,
is a
kaleidoscope
of monotheist,
dualist,
polytheist,
and animistic
legacies,
jumbling
together under
a single
divine
umbrella.
Unquote.
A religion
is a system
of norms
and values
based on
a shared
belief
in a
superhuman
order,
that is,
an order
created
and enforced
by a
power
superior
to
humankind.
This
order,
according to
most religious
systems,
isn't something
that can
or should
be altered
by anyone,
and is
binding
in respect
to standards
of behavior.
To work
as a
uniter
of a
large
group
of people,
a religion
has to be
universal,
applicable
to anyone,
anywhere,
and must
include a
drive to
spread this
order to
the rest
of the
world.
Such
religions
have helped
to unite
humanity.
The earliest
sapiens,
religious and
worldview,
was animistic.
It imbued
all plants,
animals,
and even
rock formations
and other
geographical
features with
spirits.
But these
spirits were
entirely local.
In animism,
humanity was
equal to
these spirits
and could
communicate and
bargain with
them.
With the
agricultural
revolution,
plants and
animals became
the property
of humans.
Humans could
hardly ask
favors of
their property,
and this
problem gave
rise to the
idea of
gods,
superior beings
who exerted
powerful or
limited control
over humankind's
environment,
who could be
called on to
intervene in
the affairs of
human beings,
and who might
punish people if
they were
displeased with
them.
These gods
were called
upon for
help in
matters that
sapiens could
not control,
such as the
weather or the
fertility of the
flock.
Events of the
world were
seen as a
direct outcome
of the
relationship
between humans
and these
gods, which
then raised
the status not
only of the
gods, but
of humankind
as well.
With the
rise of
polytheism,
animism did
not entirely
disappear.
The minor
spirits of
plants, animals
in the
landscape remained,
but were
inferior to
the gods.
Because the
gods of
polytheism have
only limited
power and
a vested
interest in
the affairs of
humanity, they
can be appealed
to and
bargained with.
Polytheism is
by nature
very open-minded
and does not
tend to
precipitate
wars over
religious
disputes.
The emergence
of monotheism,
the belief in
one, all-powerful
creator god to
be appealed to
directly, occurred
before Christianity,
but did not
really take
hold.
The real
breakthrough of
monotheism occurred
when a fringe
sect of
Judaism,
Christianity,
spread through
the Roman
Empire and
was adopted
by the
emperor himself.
Monotheists
believe that
they possess
the entire
message of
the one
true god
and therefore
cannot tolerate
competing messages.
Polytheism has,
however,
survived within
monotheism as
animism did in
polytheism.
For example,
look at the
saints of
Catholicism,
many of whom
were directly
transposed onto
Greek and Roman
deities.
Now, while
polytheists did
believe in an
omnipotent creator
god who created
humankind as well
as the gods,
they saw no point
in appealing to
him as he had
no interest in
the affairs of
man and,
being omnipotent,
had no biases
to be appealed
to.
Monotheists,
on the other
hand,
ascribed to
this supreme
creator interests
and biases,
making it
possible to
appeal to
him,
please him,
or anger
him.
Monotheism gave
rise to
dualism in
order to solve
the problem of
evil in the
world.
In dualism,
there are two
equally powerful
supreme beings,
one good and
other evil,
who are
constantly at
war.
Zoroastrianism is
an example of a
dualistic religion.
Now, while
dualism solves the
problem of evil,
it's hindered by
the problem of
order.
If there are two
supreme beings at
war with each
other, who makes
and enforces the
rules under which
they battle?
While dualistic
religions never
became dominant,
the major
monotheistic
religions absorbed
some dualistic
aspects.
For example,
the modern
Christian idea of
heaven and
hell is a
dualistic belief
that's not
mentioned in
Judaism or the
Old Testament.
So, also is the
belief in a
separate good
soul and
evil body.
New religions
such as
Jainism and
Buddhism eschew
gods altogether in
favor of natural
law, but in
practice, they
still include a
pantheon of
gods, such as
Buddhism's
bodhisattvas,
divine former
terrestrial beings
who have achieved
enlightenment and
who can be
appealed to for
divine assistance.
In modern
cultures, the
new natural
law religions
include communism,
capitalism,
liberalism,
nationalism,
and Nazism,
although most
people feel more
comfortable calling
these belief
systems ideologies
rather than
religions.
such ideologies,
however, have
their own
prophets and
sacred texts
and can be
just as
fanatical and
missionary as
the older
monotheistic
religions, and
the order they
believe in has
been bestowed on
humankind by a
superior power,
nature.
In reality, all
individuals and
cultures are
syncretic,
practicing a mix
of religions and
ideologies.
For example, a
person might be
simultaneously a
liberal, a
Christian, and a
capitalist.
Big idea number
six.
Of all the
shared myths,
money has been
the greatest
unifier in which
a universal,
imagined order
has been based.
Quote,
People who
don't worship
the same
god or
obey the
same king
are happy to
use the
same money.
Unquote.
Before the
development of
money, human
societies operated
in an economy of
favors and
obligations,
bartering.
But this
system breaks
down when the
number of people
gets too
large.
Barter, as
well, has
limitations and
breaks down
quickly in a
complex system.
The creation
of money is
a mental
revolution that
has occurred
separately in
many times and
places.
It allows the
quick comparison
of value,
ease of
exchanging one
thing for
another, and
storage of
wealth.
Money allows
the conversion
of anything
into anything
else.
With money as
an efficient
way to
convert, store,
and transport
wealth, humans
were able to
build lives.
larger and
more complex
commercial
networks.
The value of
money rests
purely in the
human imagination,
meaning it's a
story that we
all need to
believe across
the globe for
this thing to
work.
The raw material
of money is
trust.
The first forms
of money were
actually things
that had
inherent value.
Back then,
things like
barley in
Sumer around
3000 BC,
that was money
because it
could be traded.
It had value
to it, that
people could
actually use.
And the real
breakthrough,
however, occurred
when people were
willing to use
as money things
that did not
have intrinsic
value, like
barley or other
seeds and
grains.
Then set weights
of materials gave
rise to coins,
which were stamped
with symbols of
the rulers as a
guarantee from a
trusted authority
that it did
in fact contain
a certain amount
of a given
material or
value.
This was easier
for people, of
course, to
carry around
than large
bricks of gold
or big
giant sacks
of barley.
Now, the
trust in Rome's
emperor eventually
gave value to
Roman coins,
even outside
the Roman
empire.
And these are
the beginnings of
how coinage
started to
spread.
By the late
modern era,
the belief in
gold coins had
united the world
into a singular
monetary zone.
This, in turn,
laid the groundwork
for unifying the
entire world
into a single
economic and
political sphere.
Today, money
is a trust system
that can bridge
any cultural
gap, any
political gap,
and allows people
who don't know
each other and
have nothing in
common to
cooperate
effectively.
The two
universal principles
that make money
work, Harari
tells us, are
number one,
universal
convertibility,
and number two,
the universal
trust in its
value that
allows two
people to
cooperate.
Big idea
number seven,
the breakthrough
of the
scientific
revolution
occurred when
sapiens learned
to acknowledge
and embrace
its ignorance
in important
questions and
sought answers
through observation
and mathematical
calculation,
rather than
ancient wisdom
for the sake
of gaining
advantage.
Quote,
The scientific
revolution has
not been a
revolution of
knowledge.
It has been,
above all,
a revolution
of ignorance.
The great
discovery that
launched the
scientific
revolution was
the discovery
that humans
do not know
the answers to
their most
important questions.
Unquote.
One of the
most significant
effects of the
agricultural
revolution was
that sapiens
began to
imagine and
attempt to
control the
future.
However, up
until modern
times, the
impulse of
humans was
to believe
that the
best times,
the golden
age, were
in the past
and that
efforts at
well-being and
happiness must
look toward
tradition and
the wisdom of
the ancients as
contained in the
sacred texts.
Before about
1500 AD,
humans really
didn't think
they had the
ability to
expand their
powers in
medical,
military, and
economics.
Academics and
education were
funded by the
ruling elite for
the purpose of
preserving the
social order and
legitimizing their
rule.
This all changed
with the
scientific revolution.
Modern science is
distinct from
previous systems of
human knowledge in
three important
ways.
Number one.
First, science
admits and even
embraces ignorance.
Pre-modern systems
of knowledge presuppose
that everything we
need to know
about the world
is already known
and contained in
the sacred texts.
Whatever was not
contained in those
sacred texts was
not given to us by
God or the gods
because it was not
important for us to
know.
Modern science
assumes that we do
not know everything
and that what we
think we know
might be wrong.
The second
important distinction
of modern science
is that science
uses observation
and mathematics
to create knowledge.
Observations
are gathered
and then mathematics
is used to create
theories from them.
And the third
and final distinction
between modern science
as compared to
previous systems of
knowledge is that
knowledge is used
to obtain new
powers and to
develop new
technologies.
The scientific
revolution gave rise
to not only the
acknowledgement of
our ignorance
but the belief
that through
human effort
life for humans
can be made
better even to
the point of
attempting to
defeat the
inevitability of
death itself
which is a
concept that
Harari actually
goes deep
into in his
follow-up book

Sapiens called
Homo Deus

big idea
number eight
the most important
word in modern
economic history
is growth
the entire
economy and
the ideology
of capitalism
is based on
trust in the
future
that the
economy will
grow
that the
pie will
get bigger
quote
the new
ethic
promises
paradise
on condition
that the
rich remain
greedy
and spend
their time
making more
money
and that
the masses
give free
rein to
their cravings
and passions
and buy
more
and more
unquote
before the
modern era
money could
only represent
things that
actually existed
which limited
growth by
making it
impossible to
finance new
projects
this problem
was solved
by having
money that
represented
imaginary goods
that existed
in the future
also known
as credit
the idea
is based
on the faith
that the pie
will keep
growing bigger
credit
is the
difference
between
today's
pie
and tomorrow's
pie
now this
system
is enabled
by the
same belief
in progress
that drove
the scientific
revolution
trust in the
future
is what
enables
banks
and the
entire
economy
to survive
and flourish
and is the
sole backing
for most
of the money
in the world
this belief
Harari tells us
is the
growing
global
economic
pie
that gave
rise
to the
idea
that profits
and therefore
greed
is good
because this
drives growth
in the modern
era
the nobility
is replaced
by an elite
of traders
and industrialists
practicing capitalism
capitalism
started out
as an economic
theory
about how
money works
descriptive
but is now
a prescriptive
system of ethics
that dictates
behavior
education
of children
and how
people think
in that way
it can be
considered
a religion
a more
fanatical
sect
of capitalism
proffers
the belief
in the
sanctity
of the
free market
in reality
Harari tells us
that there's
no such
thing
as a free
market
totally independent
of government
and politics
it doesn't
exist
it's not
possible
it was
capitalism's
alliance
with politics
that allowed
the dutch
to become
dominant
in the conquering
of the new
world
in the 17th
century
the government
enforced the law
for the protection
of the creditors
which meant
people with money
to invest
could have faith
that their
investments
would be secure
capital flows
towards states
that uphold
the rule of law
and the sanctity
of private property
the economy
depends on trust
in the future
and political systems
that provide guarantees
in the form
of state punishments
against cheats
and the protection
of property
by police forces
also
capitalism alone
cannot
ensure
the protection
and well-being
of people
against the profit
motive
quite the opposite
in fact
the drive of profit
is its
indifference
to suffering
its indifference
to the inevitability
that creates it
when not checked
and controlled
by a political system
another outcropping
of capitalism
is the new
ethic of consumerism
capitalism
cannot survive
without production
more and more
and more
and production
cannot survive
without consumption
more and more
and more
this fact
has given rise
to a new ideology
that posits
that consuming
is good
but the most
sacred
commandment
of capitalism
is that
capital
must be
reinvested
in production
capitalism
distinguishes
between capital
and wealth
while wealth
is stored
or wasted
on unproductive
activities
capital
is invested
in production
while
the religions
of the past
have driven people
to murder each other
out of hatred
capitalism
kills
not out of hatred
but indifference
money
is
amoral
not moral
not immoral
but just
indifferent
it's amoral
think of the
Atlantic slave trade
for instance
the defense of capitalism
on this charge
is twofold
firstly
we now live
in a world
in which we cannot
do without it
just like we can't
reverse the agricultural
revolution
and go back
to being hunter-gatherers
secondly
some argue
capitalism's promise
of paradise
is just
around the corner
if we could
just be patient
eventually
the pie
will grow
large enough
that everyone
can get a fat slice
big idea
number nine
sapiens
made a major
breakthrough
about 500 years
ago
after learning
to convert
stored
solar energy
into kinetic energy
through machines
this breakthrough
is known
as the
industrial
revolution
quote
science
industry
and military
technology
intertwined
with the advent
of the capitalist
system
and the
industrial
revolution
once this
relationship
was established
it quickly
transformed
the world
unquote
people
did not know
until about
500 years
ago
how to convert
one form
of energy
into another
they did
make use
of energy
sources around
them
for example
burning wood
to cook
heat houses
and smelt
iron
wind power
moved sailing
ships around
and water power
turned mills
to grind
grain
but these
sources
were not
always available
only human
and animal
bodies
could convert
energy
to mechanical
force
through muscle
power
all energy
was solar
energy
stored as
organic
compounds
by plants
through the
mechanism
of photosynthesis
all human
activity
therefore
was dependent
upon cycles
of plant
growth
and the
seasons
the breakthrough
came
when humans
finally realized
that they
could convert
that stored
energy
into mechanical
force
this
was first
done
in British
coal mines
when coal
was burned
to create
steam
that moved
a machine
to pump
water
out of the
mines
it soon
occurred
to them
to use
this same
mechanism
to move
the machinery
of textile
mills
previously
powered by
rivers
and then
all kinds
of other
machines
from there
humankind
became obsessed
with figuring
out how
to harness
all kinds
of energy
sources
to machines
in order
to meet
any
and every
need
this
is known
as the
industrial
revolution
this ability
to convert
energy
to other
forms of
energy
solved one
of the main
problems
limiting
economic
growth
the scarcity
of resources
the industrial
revolution
was essentially
and mostly
a second
agricultural
revolution
as humankind
began using
machinery
and energy
conversion
in the form
of farm
machinery
chemical
fertilizers
and pesticides
mass
transportation
and refrigeration
to totally
revolutionize
the way humans
produce
and consume
food
industrial
agricultural
production
is a mainstay
of modern
human
society
big idea
number 10
our two
most powerful
shared
fictions
the state
and the market
have given
rise to the
individual
who is both
liberated
and constrained
by these
two imagined
orders
the state
and market
are the
mother and
father
of the
individual
and the
individual
can survive
only
thanks to
them
unquote
the industrial
revolution
opened the
way to
many forms
of social
engineering
by which
humans have
altered the
way they
live their
daily lives
including
the implementation
of standardized
timetables
urbanization
the rise of
the proletariat
and empowerment
of the
common person
the erosion
of the
patriarchy
and youth
culture as
well
but the
most important
of these
has been
the replacement
of the
family
and community
by the
state
and the
market
since
the industrial
revolution
most of
the functions
of the
nuclear family
the extended
family
and the
local
community
have been
taken over
by the
state
and the
market
which now
provides
for most
individual
needs
now this
liberation
of the
individual
however
comes with
the price
of a loss
of meaningful
family
and community
connections
that leaves
the individual
feeling alienated
and threatened
by the power
of the state
and market
however
the market
and the state
provide a sort
of tribal
band
through imagined
communities
the two most
important ones
being nations
and consumer
tribes
both
nationalism
and consumerism
are intersubjective
realities of sorts
that make us
imagine ourselves
as sharing a
common past
and future
as well as
common interests
in the present
with thousands
and even millions
of complete
strangers
big idea
number 11
we now live
in a single
global
culture
whose unification
has been
driven
by the growth
of empires
and the
intensification
of trade
quote
the global
empire
being forged
before our
eyes
is not
governed
by any
particular
state
or ethnic
group
much like
the late
Roman Empire
it is ruled
by a
multi
ethnic
elite
and is held
together
by a
common
culture
and common
interests
unquote
for most
of sapiens
history
our species
was spread
over the
earth
as a
galaxy
of totally
separate
human
worlds
beginning
with the
cognitive
revolution
sapiens
learned
to cooperate
with complete
strangers
with whom
they shared
imaginary
connections
humanity
has evolved
steadily
away
from an
us versus
them
mentality
to a
more
unified
society
through
the
mechanisms
of three
universal
orders
number one
the monetary
order
number two
the imperial
order
and number
three
religious
order
in the
form of
universal
religions
and secular
ideologies
now around
500 years
ago
an alliance
was formed
between
science
european
empires
and capitalist
economics
since then
the engine
of social
evolution
has been
this alliance
europe
became the
dominant
cultural
empire
because of
two things
modern science
and capitalism
the european
impulse to
explore and
conquer the
world
was driven
by a
scientific
mindset
one that
admits
ignorance
and seeks
new
knowledge
they began
drawing maps
blank spots
and then
fanatically
pursuing
those
blank spots
to fill
them in
they sent
teams of
scientists
on every
voyage
to gather
data
which they
then used
to gain
a practical
advantage
in their
conquering
of other
cultures
both
modern
science
and
imperialism
were
motivated
by the
feeling
that there
was something
important
just beyond
the horizon
science
is imperial
and imperialism
is scientific
science
provided
empires
with practical
knowledge
technology
and ideological
justification
empires
provided science
with information
and support
for their
endeavors
now the
two
characteristics
of an
empire
are as
follows
number one
it rules
over a
large number
of distinct
people
with separate
cultural
identities
and territories
and number
two
its borders
are flexible
and its
appetite
for further
annexation
possibly
limitless
meaning
they just
want to
continue
to conquer
new lands
over and
over and
over again
as long
as they
possibly
can
now
although
the word
empire
now carries
a very
negative
connotation
harari
tells us
that
it's really
impossible
to label
empires
as being
either good
or evil
they are
simply
the reality
that has
shaped our
world
for both
good
and bad
at the
time
imperialists
genuinely
believed
that they
were working
for the
greater good
of all
humanity
in the
21st century
nearly
everyone
on earth
is the
product
of an
empire
empires
did not
simply
impose
their own
cultures
on those
they
conquered
rather
they
adopted
and
co-opted
aspects
of these
people
absorbing
parts of
their
culture
along with
the land
and people
into the
empire
empires
united
diverse
ethnic
groups
and
geographical
zones
under
one
giant
political
umbrella
the legacy
of imperialism
in modern
cultures
has been
a set
of languages
those of
former empires
used by
most people
and a
standardization
of laws
as well
in the
modern world
there is
no such
thing
as an
authentic
culture
untouched
by the
influence
of empire
even
now
in
independent
nations
and former
empires
the people
live by
and under
political
social
and cultural
forms
inherited
from
previous
imperial
conquerors
and it
would be
impossible
for them
to return
to any
other type
of authentic
culture
that existed
before the
conquerors
arrived
why
because there
are just
way too
many
intertwining
cultures
and influences
to make
a clean
distinction
between
some of
the massive
melting pots
across the
globe
what's emerging
now
is actually
a truly
global
empire
as nationalism
weakens its
grip
and people
increasingly
see each
other
as united
by the
commonalities
of our
human species
we now
exist
Harari tells
us in a
single
global
culture
though it's
not homogenous
it is
interconnected
and has
been
since the
18th century
big idea
number 12
whether we
are moving
in the
modern era
toward heaven
or hell
is likely
not decided
and will
depend upon
a string
of coincidences
but
we also
may be able
to take
some control
of our
destiny
and achieve
happiness
if
we can
figure out
what that
is
quote
historians
have
researched
just about
everything
politics
society
economics
gender
diseases
sexuality
food
clothing
yet
they have
seldom
stopped
to ask
how these
influence
human
happiness
unquote
history
has not
developed
toward the
well-being
and benefit
of humans
in most
cases
quite the
opposite
the quality
of individual
human life
has actually
suffered greatly
for many
of the
developments
of history
however
human
violence
has declined
drastically
in the modern
era
due to the
rise of
the nation
state
the independent
states
that rose
after the
decline
of the
major empires
after world
war ii
have been
uninterested
in war
the benefits
are too
little
and the cost
too great
peace
is now
far more
profitable
than war
harari says
and it
is in
everyone's
interest
to maintain
it
war
used to
be viewed
by the
majority
as good
but now
in the
modern era
it's viewed
by the
majority
as bad
moreover
the agricultural
scientific
and industrial
revolutions
have fundamentally
altered
the social
order
so that
it's flexible
rather than
rigid
as it was
traditionally
common
orthodoxy
now holds
that the
world
and the
social order
are something
we can change
and improve
at will
with the
right knowledge
and the
right technology
which means
that we
as a species
bear some
responsibility
for which
direction
we want
to go
what looks
inevitable
in hindsight
was not at all
the obvious
future before
in fact
many things
that previously
seemed
impossible
have become
not just
possible
but also
part of
our
everyday
lives
in the
modern
world
think
about
airplanes
cell phones
the internet
can you
imagine
putting an
early
homo sapiens
on an
airplane
he'd freak
out
deterministic
laws
do not
seem to
bind
outcomes
even
though
there are
certain
biological
geographical
and economic
forces
that constrain
the possibilities
this means
that our
current belief
in the
values
of human
rights
nationalism
and capitalism
are coincidental
it also means
that with
our newfound
awareness
we can decide
what it is
we want
whether it's
possible
and expedient
to achieve
happiness
and how best
to go about
making it
happen
closing notes
the key
takeaways
from sapiens
are as follows
what we
what we think
of as
divine
or natural
orders
are really
just
invented
orders
based on
collective
human
imagination
it's not
possible
to escape
an imagined
order
without entering
another
but it is
possible
to alter
the order
and finally
the purpose
of studying
history
is not
to make
predictions
but to
understand
how
we got
where we
are
and that
other outcomes
were and
therefore
are
possible
in the
future
actionable
insights
first
it's not
only possible
but unavoidable
to live
by several
conflicting
belief systems
you can be
a nationalist
a christian
and a capitalist
all at the
same time
even though
they hold
conflicting
belief systems
and finally
the development
and outcomes
of human
history
have been
coincidental
rather than
inevitable
but we now
live in a world
where the
social order
is flexible
and humankind
is increasingly
empowered
to control
it
