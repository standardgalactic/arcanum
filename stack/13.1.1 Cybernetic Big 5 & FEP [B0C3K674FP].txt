episode description i am blue knight the host and curator of this episode which is clipped from
live stream number 13.1 this discussion is based on the 2020 paper entitled integrating cybernetic
big five theory with the free energy principle a new strategy for modeling personalities as complex
systems by adam saffron and colin de young the discussion will be facilitated by daniel friedman
who is going to start us off with a question all right we have an individual orientation around
the big five it's about the individual in relationship to different types of settings
but then how do you capture that element of niche construction or of group dynamics or of these other
aspects that are relational i'm just curious where does the uh other how does that enter into it this
idea of the cultural influences in on personality because someone's personality might be manifested in a
really specific setting because of their local context uh colin de young and i'm in minneapolis
minnesota um i'm a professor in the psychology department here at the university of minnesota
i could just say something about that that is relevant i think to both of the two questions that
have just been asked uh which is just to keep in mind that um these personality traits are descriptions
of uh you know persistent patterns of people's behavior and we know that they are genetically
influenced but we also know that they're not entirely determined by genetics they are also determined
by environmental influences and so the way that i think about this is that you have these uh you know
these mechanisms that are allowing people to function and some parameters of those mechanisms must be
reasonably persistent to produce these persistent patterns of behavior but the the things that set
those parameters and that tweak them if there's change in personality over time can be both uh genetically
programmed and environmentally programmed right so there are things there are events that happen to
people for example their relations to their primary caregiver and attachment um that shape what these
settings are going to be persistently in life um and so i think there's definitely room for thinking
about environmental inputs uh to these systems and shaping of these parameters uh as well as genetic ones
cool um yeah marco
hi thanks i'm marco um i'm from holland and used to work on active inference in london but now i'm just
enjoying the progress from the sidelines and as for the first question about what i'd like to see it
might be a bit um in the far future but i think ideally um this would all connect sooner or later to
the work on neurophenomenology the kind of ideal vision i have is for example now we've been talking
about um genetic priorities uh and uh environmental inputs but i think the beautiful part about cybernetics is
the kind of reflexive action and so consciousness or phenomenology is basically a mediator or moderator
of the way that environmental inputs kind of influence our continued progression of personality
or um traits and and characteristics and so ideally um i would love to see a well i would love to hear if
it's possible to make a synthesis of for example the work from psychoanalysis psychotherapy everything that
kind of uh explores and navigates these particular mechanisms from a first person kind of view how
to navigate the experience of being engaged in the world and i'm just wondering about adam's or
connor someone else's thoughts on how to possibly connect that phenomenological um description of
mechanisms and processes with the more formal um basic models that we're now exploring in this kind of
work that makes sense yeah very nice adam and then anyone else hi i'm adam i am based out of bloomington indiana
uh i'm a postdoctoral researcher so i guess uh uh try to address a couple of things um
so yeah uh yeah marco just thrust us into like the deepest possible territory like right away
um and so i guess i'll briefly comment on that uh second but the i said the first thing in terms of um
social context and uh niche construction and the more intersubjective aspects and context um sensitivity
and personality uh active inferential modeling is really well equipped to uh address all of that
uh in this paper it was more uh the focus was just kind of exploring what uh colin and i both perceived
to be a very rich set of correspondences between the free energy principle and active inference and
uh his theory of cybernetic big five theory but in um modeling work you can uh bring in all of those
details and explore them in their particular so i'm currently collaborating on a project where we're
trying to model things like extroversion within these um social choice tasks and so how you show up it's
going to be a function of you know both the task environment and you as this interaction that's going to
evoke a given style of pattern but you'll have these um parameters uh these hyper priors are um over the
different um aspects of the generative model which through iterated policy selection and uh updating
will basically concentrate their probability mouse in different ways and result in different
parameterizations and then different emergent behavior and what you can see happen is you can get
uh these basically attractors form as this process proceeds over time these behavioral attractors where
you the concentration of your prior for engaging in the world in a certain way causes you to enact
the given pattern which causes you to uh even more update in that direction like your your d matrix like
where am i in this environment uh you know what do you expect to be perceiving your a matrices all the
different like components that you'd use to try to model the parts of an agent these were all your
priors of these all get updated will then cause the pattern of an action so on and so forth and that
over time this could cause you to be in this attractor where you have this enduring stability
um how enduring you know it would depend on a variety of things uh and but so i guess that's one
i also so in this process uh the social context who you're interacting with that would make all the
difference in terms of like how the kind of ball rolls down this uh epigenetic landscape like how you end
up like carving out a given pattern for this agent uh with respect to uh neurophenomenology and just the
actually getting at the richness of experience there's a sense in which all active inferential modeling is
already in a way um kind of personality modeling it's like you're kind of getting into like um uh
these enduring um you know these cybernet what they're thinking of them as these like cybernet
parameters for this fundamental process um or just the your ability to describe um the essence of the
system uh the it's it's normal form description this this maximally encompassing uh description of the
modes of where you expect to find the system as a kind of probabilistic density in some kind of
multi-dimensional uh phase space um if you have such a uh attracting network structure that you can
describe in a way you could call that the personality of the system um but cybernet big five theory um kind of
goes further and and uh or it is grounding this in terms of well why should we expect certain modes
over others why should we expect this then relates it back to this fundamental cybernetic cycle of
of goal pursuit that any agent has to do um so with respect to neurophenomenology and it seems like the
attempts to get at this within active inference things like uh sophisticated effective inference the
the models of uh metacognition where they're beginning to model the kinds of mindful processing of
reflecting on your um your confidence and then this influencing your uh you you having an actual
model of your epistemic status you reflect you're reflecting on this and this influencing how you sample
influencing uh how confident you are in different ways um influencing what policies you end up
deploying uh these things that to the extent that they allow for um phenomenological richness
they could be brought into an agent model and you're beginning to do a connection between
neurophenomenology or a process theory of would doc of phenomenology and personality modeling so those are
some thoughts nice thanks and to add on that adam because that was really well said it's almost like
some of these past papers we've been discussing were the neutral infrastructure or the architecture
or the tools to have agents that can have memory or can have affect or can perceive valence or get
worried so we talked that in a very neutral framework like it's a parameter in the model however in the
real world as colin was getting at there's these extremely deep correlations with different outcomes
of systems people who like to text more also like to video chat more or something and that might not
be surprising but it these trends are very distinct and so we are getting at this generative model idea
personality as a generator of outcomes in different niches so inseparable from the niche and um
it's just an interesting way to see how the cybernetic big five has come from a more psychological area
so it has uh that sort of um toe of the neuro phenomenology and the real correlations in the
world and then there's the neutral framework that sort of maps onto that we have steven and then colin
i am steven i'm in toronto and uh i like what's being said about neuro phenomenology and i'd also
say that one of the things that's good about the this this work with traits is it it's starting to
bring work that's coming from um what you could say realist settings codifying it and then finding
the patterns and it's given us more uh material coming the other way we've had some work around
a lot of work with affordances and niches and then obviously you've got the models which start to create
dynamics and show and then you start to see where these two things meet but i would also say micro
i've been looking a lot of micro phenomenology and the actual structuring of experience and attention
and i think that um what can be interesting is these traits if these traits can also get brought
down into micro phenomenology and ways of like how is the structure of the environment body mind um
happening and and where are their times because what i think with a lot of the trait works is it does
have a normative assumption about the type of life someone's in around which you then standardize
and then get these patterns you do find if you take people into some other types of space or other
types of attentional state be it a more grounded state maybe a a performative state maybe a space which is
less western so to speak less goal orientated um that might shift so this might be like this is where
that is when people are at this normative mediated uh sort of normative like calculated way of getting
everyone at the goal directed norm for a westerner um and then can these different components to that
be sort of treated and also looked at how do they vary as we move like not just as the five but in
you know as individual kind of um tap ways to tap into affordances when do these change more or less
when we bring people into another type of way of a regime of attention or another set of affordances
which is outside the normal for our cultural goal driven way of being in the west okay colin i just had
a couple of thoughts about phenomenology since that's been a theme um recently um first of all i
think one interesting thing to think about in relation to uh trait approaches is that when we do
assessments of personality using self-report questionnaires you know which is not the only way
that you can do it of course you can have other people you know rate the personality of somebody and
we tend to see very similar results if we use other people's writings versus self ratings um
although there's also evidence that there's some incremental validity there in other words you know
things about yourself that other people don't know so that there's some unique validity to your reports
but other people also know things about you that you don't know so there's also some unique validity
to other people's reports on your personality but as long as we're talking about the self-reports
then that is at base a kind of you know crude phenomenological measure right because you're saying
what are you like what is your experience of yourself like are you the kind of person who's
anxious are you the kind of person who likes art you know and we get a long list of people's responses
on these things and then we uh infer their general patterns of behavior from them and so i do think
you know one of the things that i've always been interested in is that personality is not just patterns
of behavior from a third person perspective it's also patterns of experience from a first person
perspective and so when we look at the contents of personality questionnaires you know they involve
descriptions of emotion and types of cognition and patterns of motivation that can all be experienced
you know phenomenologically in the first person as well and so we're using this kind of first person
representation and understanding of ourselves to then try to infer these general patterns of behavior
that have validity from an objective third person perspective as well and then just in terms of like
drilling down to this kind of micro phenomenology idea we do know things about particular patterns of
processing that are associated with different personality traits so for example we just published
a paper showing that extroversion is associated with the tendency to be influenced by uh reward in an
implicit learning context right so you're doing a task where you're making this like discrimination between two very
similar options um and you're rewarded more for getting correct responses to one option relative to the
other well what you see is that um people's behavior becomes biased toward that option but the degree it
becomes bias is actually correlated with extroversion and that's part of how we you know have support for the
theory that fundamentally what causes all of these different extroverted behaviors to cohere is sensitivity to reward
um and so you can think of that from the third person as like here's a process of you know reward
mapping but you can also think well what is it like from that for this individual this is the kind of
person who's going to be more uh perceptive of possibilities for uh rewarding interactions for
incentives in their environment so i think you can always sort of flip back and forth between taking the
phenomenological and the more uh third person perspective on these things we hope you enjoyed
this episode stay tuned for next time where we're going to have more discussions of this paper
