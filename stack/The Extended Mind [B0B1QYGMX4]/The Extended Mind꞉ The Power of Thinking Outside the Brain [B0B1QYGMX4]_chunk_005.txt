then another and another, acquiring a solid understanding and gaining confidence as they go.
The approach has allowed many JUMP participants, including some who struggled to grasp the most
basic mathematical concepts in school, to achieve proficiency in the subject. An evaluation of the
JUMP program conducted by researchers from the University of Toronto and Toronto's Hospital for
Sick Children, and published in 2019, provides support for Mitin's method. By the second year
of the study, JUMP students in grade 3 had made greater progress in problem-solving, and JUMP
students in grade 6 had made greater gains across a broad range of mathematical skills—calculation,
math fluency, and applied problems—than those who had received traditional instruction.
Experts have another edge over novices. They know what to attend to and what to ignore.
Presented with a professionally relevant scenario, experts will immediately home in on its most
salient aspects, while beginners waste their time focusing on unimportant features. But research
shows that the expertise of experienced practitioners can be made more accessible by deliberately exaggerating
it, even distorting it, such that the pertinent elements pop out for the novice, as they do for the expert.
A number of years ago, the U.S. Air Force sought the advice of psychologist Itiel Dror,
now a senior researcher at University College London. Endeavoring to prevent friendly fire aimed at their own
aircraft, Air Force leaders were looking for ways to improve the ability of pilots in training to instantly recognize
the shapes of various planes. Dror observed that the trainees were becoming overwhelmed with details
about the many airplanes they were expected to identify. He took a new tack, digitally morphing the
outlines of the aircraft diagrams the pilots were given to study. Planes with a wide wingspan became even
wider. Sharp-angled planes were made pointier. Snub-nosed planes appeared more rounded. The differences among the
aircraft, once subtle and hard to notice, now leaped out at the pilots, and they continued to recognize
these distinguishing features even when they viewed the planes at normal scale. Dror's method is related
to a phenomenon that psychologists call the caricature advantage, the fact that we recognize a caricatured
face even more readily than we recognize a true-to-life depiction. While a caricature does distort its
subject's actual appearance, it does so in a systematic way, exaggerating what is unique or distinctive about
that individual, thereby making him or her even more instantly identifiable. Think of George W. Bush's
prominent ears, or Bill Clinton's bulbous nose, or the late Ruth Bader Ginsburg's oversized glasses.
Experts can leverage the caricature advantage by playing up the unique features that differentiate
among a group of examples, examples that, to a novice, may come off as confusingly similar.
A third difference between experts and novices lies in the way they categorize what they see.
Novices sort the entities they encounter according to their superficial features, while experts classify
them according to their deep function. A classic experiment by Arizona State University professor
Michelin Chi asked eight experts, advanced PhD students from a university physics department,
and eight novices, undergraduates who had taken a single semester of physics, to sort two dozen physics
problems, each one described on an index card, into categories of their choosing. The classifications
devised by the two groups could not have been more different. The undergraduates sorted the
problems according to their surface features, whether the problems involved springs or pulleys or inclined
planes. The graduate students, meanwhile, categorized the problems on the basis of the underlying principles
of physics they represented—conservation of energy, the work energy theorem, conservation of momentum.
There's far more useful information embedded in the categories applied by experts. So why not present
novices with information that's already organized by function? That notion was behind a new kind of
wine store created by Joshua Wesson, an expert sommelier and entrepreneur who founded the chain Best Sellers.
I heard the same questions all the time and they all reduced to, how can I make sense of the world
of wine without having to master all the details? How can I deal with all these choices when all I want
is a wine that goes with pizza? Says Wesson. In most stores selling wine, he observes, bottles are arranged by
grape—chardonnay, cabernet sauvignon—or by region—California, France. Such classifications communicate
little to the uneducated wine consumer. Wine experts, meanwhile, know about surface-level characteristics
like grapes and regions, but they think about wine in terms of function. Wines that are luscious and
fruity, good for pairing with spicy food. Wines that are big and bold and can stand up to a hearty meal.
Wines that are fizzy and festive, fit for a celebration. Luscious, big, and fizzy are, in fact,
three of the eight categories Wesson devised for his stores. The others are soft, fresh, juicy,
smooth, and sweet. Foregrounding these features is like giving customers a shortcut to thinking the
way a sommelier does. Following Wesson's lead, experts more generally can make themselves into
accessible models for imitation by communicating the categories they use to organize information—categories
that are themselves packed with meaning about how experts' thinking operates.
These strategies—breaking down agglomerated steps, exaggerating salient features, supplying
categories based on function—help pry open the black box of experts' automatized knowledge and skill.
Extended technology may offer an even more direct probe into the mind of the expert. For example,
the nature of expertise is now being studied using eye tracking, the automated monitoring of where the
expert's gaze falls, when, and for how long. Research has shown that, across disciplines, experts look in
ways different from novices. They take in the big picture more rapidly and completely, while focusing on the
most important aspects of the scene. They're less distracted by visual noise and they shift more
easily among visual fields, avoiding getting stuck. Within any occupation—among surgeons, pilots,
programmers, architects, even high school teachers—experts' gaze patterns are highly similar, while beginners are
widely divergent and idiosyncratic. Yet experts are not aware of how they engage in looking. Their
gaze patterns are not available for conscious inspection. Eye-tracking technology can capture this
aspect of their expertise and make it available for use by novices, guiding their gaze with unobtrusive cues
about where to look. It's a way of cheating experience, as one researcher puts it—a shortcut
around hours of observation and practice that could potentially make learning much more efficient and
effective. Researchers are also experimenting with haptic signals—physical nudges delivered via special
gloves or tools that help mold a novice's movement patterns into those of an expert. While brain-bound
approaches to education and training convey information almost exclusively through visual and auditory
channels, haptic technologies supply guidance and feedback directly to the body. Preliminary results
suggest that their use can reduce cognitive load and improve performance for many kinds of learners,
from students learning to play the violin to medical residents learning to perform laparoscopic surgery.
In a sense, these innovations represent a technologically enhanced take on the teaching that has unfolded
within apprenticeships for centuries—the 21st-century version of a master craftsman's pointing finger or
guiding hand. The indenture contracts for those old-time apprenticeships often propose to provide the
apprentice's labor in exchange for instruction in the trade, art, and mystery of the craft, whether it be
carpentry or blacksmithing or shipbuilding. In an age of knowledge work, the mystery of expertise is even more
enshrouded, hidden by the scrim of automization. Pulling this curtain aside requires experts to forego the
familiar conventions of brain-bound instruction—to think outside the brain, where their cognition can be seen.
Chapter 8. Thinking with Peers
Carl Wieman knows his way around a perplexing problem. A professor of physics at Stanford University,
Wieman was awarded the Nobel Prize in 2001 for figuring out, along with his colleague Eric Cornell,
how to create, in the laboratory, an extreme state of matter known as the Bose-Einstein condensate.
But Wieman's mastery in the lab did not extend to the classroom, as he would be the first to admit. For
years he wrestled with what would seem to be a straightforward task—how to get undergraduates
to understand physics in the way he understood physics. Laying it out for them, describing,
explaining, even demonstrating the core concepts of the discipline—was not working. No matter how
clearly he elucidated these ideas, no matter how energetically he communicated them, his students'
ability to solve the problems he posed to them remained rudimentary. This failure to think like a
physicist is more the rule than the exception. Decades of research have found that high school
and college students who are taught physics in the conventional manner, via lectures and textbooks,
typically don't learn the subject in any depth. So it was for Wieman and his students. Wieman knew how
to cool and trap atoms using light from a powerful laser. From work carried out in his lab, he understood how
atoms interact at ultra-cold temperatures more than 400 degrees below zero. He had discovered how to
cause atoms to oscillate at the same frequency, or sing in unison, as the Royal Swedish Academy of
Sciences put it in announcing his Nobel. But he could not seem to pin down the process by which a halting
thinker turned into a dexterous one. Wieman ultimately found the key to his conundrum in an
unexpected place—not in his undergraduate classes, but among the graduate students who came to work in
his laboratory. When they first arrived at the lab, Wieman noticed, his PhD candidates were more like the
undergrads than not. They knew plenty about physics, but their habits of thought were narrow and rigid.
Within just a year or two, however, these same graduate students had grown into models of the
kind of supple, flexible thinker Wieman was trying so earnestly and unsuccessfully to mold.
It was clear to me that there was some kind of intellectual process present in the research lab
that was sorely missing from the traditional education process, Wieman recounts.
A major factor in the grad students' transformation, he concluded, was their experience of intense
social engagement around a body of knowledge—the hours they spent advising, debating with,
and recounting anecdotes to one another. A 2019 study published in the Proceedings of the National
Academy of Sciences supports Wieman's hunch. Tracking the intellectual advancement of several hundred
graduate students in the sciences over the course of four years, its authors found that the development
of crucial skills, such as generating hypotheses, designing experiments, and analyzing data, was
closely related to the students' engagement with their peers in the lab, and not to the guidance they
received from their faculty mentors. Social interaction appeared to be an essential facilitator of intelligent
and thought. But, Wieman realized, such exchanges were almost completely absent from traditional undergraduate
lecture courses. The way he'd been teaching, students sat listening to him talk, hardly uttering a word to one
another. Wieman set out to change that, aiming to generate within his college classes the very sort of
intellectual process that turned the graduate students in his lab into first-rate thinkers. Students no longer sat
silently in rows. Instead, they huddled together in clusters, debating the solution to a challenging
physics problem Wieman had posed. While the deliberations went on, Wieman and his teaching assistants circulated
around the room, listening for misconceptions and offering feedback. When Wieman retook the podium,
it was to reveal and explain the right answer, and to offer a commentary on where alternative responses went wrong.
By initiating what he called multiple, brief, small group discussions among the students, and by asking
them to venture a judgment, when they were expected to defend against challenges from classmates who held
a different view, Wieman was creating the conditions in which undergraduates could learn to think like expert physicists.
Wieman is one of a growing number of professors in the STEM disciplines who are bringing this active learning
approach to their courses. Research demonstrates that students who engage in active learning acquire a
deeper understanding of the material, score higher on exams, and are less likely to fail or drop out.
Wieman, who holds an appointment in Stanford School of Education as well as in its physics department,
spends most of his time evangelizing for more effective ways of teaching science. He donated his Nobel Prize winnings,
this big pot of money that fell from this big pot of money that fell from the sky, to improving physics instruction.
His aspiration is to move science education away from the lecture format toward a model that is more active and more engaged.
Wieman is working to achieve wider recognition of an often overlooked truth. The development of intelligent thinking is fundamentally a social process.
We can engage in thinking on our own, of course, and at times solitary cognition is what's called for by a particular problem or project.
Even then, solo thinking is rooted in our lifelong experience of social interaction.
Linguists and cognitive scientists theorize that the constant pattern we carry on in our heads is a kind of internalized conversation.
Our brains evolved to think with people, to teach them, to argue with them, to exchange stories with them.
Human thought is exquisitely sensitive to context, and one of the most powerful contexts of all is the presence of other people.
As a consequence, when we think socially, we think differently, and often better, than when we think non-socially.
To offer just one example, the brain stores social information differently than it stores information that is non-social.
Social memories are encoded in a distinct region of the brain.
What's more, we remember social information more accurately, a phenomenon that psychologists call the social encoding advantage.
If findings like this feel unexpected, that's because our culture largely excludes social interaction from the realm of the intellect.
Social exchanges with others might be enjoyable or entertaining, this attitude holds, but they're no more than a diversion, what we do around the edges of school or work.
Serious thinking, real thinking, is done on one's own, sequestered from others.
Science has not infrequently served to reinforce this notion.
All of us have seen the images generated by fMRI, or functional magnetic resonance imaging,
the gray mass of the brain enlivened with patches of color denoting regions that are actively engaged in thought.
The way technologies like fMRI are applied is a product of our brain-bound orientation.
It has not seemed odd or unusual to examine the individual brain on its own, unconnected to others.
And the ubiquitous depictions generated by fMRI in turn perpetuate that very orientation.
The scans offer a vivid visual affirmation of the assumption that everything worth observing happens within the bounds of a single skull.
Scientists who might have wished to investigate the role of social interaction on cognition have until recently been hampered by technical constraints.
For many years following the introduction of fMRI, researchers were all but required to examine the individual in seclusion shut inside the solitary bore of the MRI machine.
Thus, the neuroscientific study of how people think has been, for decades, the study of people thinking alone.
Now that it's changing, as a growing interest in the social dimension of cognition has arrived alongside a new generation of more flexible and adaptable tools.
Technologies such as electroencephalography, EEG, and functional near-infrared spectroscopy, FINEERS,
are allowing scientists to scan multiple people's brains as they interact in naturalistic settings, making deals, playing games, or simply talking to one another.
Using these tools, researchers have found persuasive evidence for what is known as the interactive brain hypothesis,
the premise that when people interact socially, their brains engage different neural and cognitive processes than when those same people are thinking or acting on their own.
A representative example of this research emerges out of the study of how the brain comprehends and produces language.
As far back as the 19th century, two bundles of gray matter, Broca's area and Wernicke's area, have been regarded as the brain's canonical language regions.
They are named after Paul Broca and Carl Wernicke, scientists who discovered the region's language-related function through their studies of brain-damaged patients,
including autopsies of the patients following their deaths.
Confirming the scientists' hunches a century after they were advanced, Broca's area and Wernicke's area were the very regions that lit up in fMRI scans of study participants who were asked to read or listen to words.
But the long-established canon elaborating the brain's functional anatomy is now being revised by a new wave of research, carried out with a new array of tools.
In experiments that track brain activity while subjects are not reading or passively listening, but actually talking to other people,
a third and heretofore unknown language-related neural circuit has been identified.
Studies using FNIRS, a brain-scanning technology that works via a flexible band encircling the head,
demonstrate that this newly recognized network, called the sub-central area,
is specialized for predicting and responding to language as it is used moment by moment in conversation.
This discovery adds to accumulating evidence showing that engaging in real-time conversation
involves much more nimble and nuanced cognitive processes than does the simple recognition of discrete words.
It requires us to anticipate the language our conversational partner will use in speaking to us
and to improvise the language we ourselves will muster in response.
A related finding emerged when scientists, again employing FNIRS,
compared the brain scans of people playing poker with a human partner
to those of people playing the same game with a computer.
The areas of the brain involved in generating a theory of mind,
inferring the mental state of another individual,
were active in competing with a human, but dormant in matching wits with a machine.
In a sense, it was not the same game at all.
Play against a human partner produced a distinctively different pattern of brain activity.
A larger number of brain regions were activated,
and these regions manifested a higher degree of connectivity with one another.
Playing against another human produced a richer experience, neurologically speaking,
than playing against a computer.
Other studies have found that areas of the brain involved in planning and anticipation
and in feeling empathy are more active when we are playing against a human
as compared to a computer.
Brain regions associated with reward also show stronger stimulation when we play,
and especially when we win against a human opponent.
The tools employed in such research are so unobtrusive they can even be used with babies and toddlers,
allowing scientists to explore how social interaction shapes the thinking of children
as they grow and develop.
EEG is a technology that tracks and records brainwave patterns via a cap of electrodes placed on a subject's scalp.
It was applied in a study conducted by Patricia Kuhl,
a psychologist at the University of Washington.
Kuhl and her collaborators observed nine-month-old infants from English-speaking homes
as they interacted with a Spanish-speaking tutor,
counting how many times the babies shifted their gaze between the tutor
and the toys the tutor pointed to while speaking the names of the toys in Spanish.
Such eye movements, Kuhl explains,
provide an indication of the degree to which the children were bringing their social capacities to bear
on their learning of a new language.
After 12 of these tutoring sessions,
the researchers obtained a neural measure of the baby's second language learning,
using EEG to gauge how strongly their brains reacted to hearing Spanish spoken aloud.
The infants who had engaged in the most social interaction,
frequently looking back and forth between the tutor and the toys the tutor was talking about,
also showed the most evidence of having learned Spanish,
as indicated by their brain activity in response to Spanish sounds.
Such neuroscientific findings join a larger body of evidence generated by psychology and cognitive science,
all pointing to a striking conclusion.
We think best when we think socially.
Yet even as scientific evidence of the link between social interaction and intelligent thought accumulates,
our society remains mired in a brain-bound approach to cognition.
Our activities at school and at work still treat thinking as the manipulation of abstract symbols inside individual heads.
We are asked to produce facts on tests and reports without the presence of a person to edify.
We make arguments, write essays, author memos, without the presence of a person to debate.
We are asked to set information out, log entries in a knowledge management system,
or take information in, read manuals and instructions,
without the presence of a person with whom to trade stories.
We are, that is, continually expected to think about abstract symbols for the benefit of an abstract audience,
an expectation that overlooks our actual strength.
Humans are not especially good at thinking about concepts.
Our ability to think about people, however, is superlative.
Consider the Wason Selection Task, a test of reasoning widely used in experimental psychology.
Introduced by psychologist Peter Wason in 1966, the task seems straightforward enough.
One version of it goes something like this.
Take a look at the cards shown here.
Each card has a vowel or a consonant on one side, and an even or an odd number on the other.
Which card or cards must be turned over in order to determine whether it is true that
if a card has a vowel on one side, it has an even number on the other?
Four cards are displayed.
The first is marked with an E, the second with a K, the third with the number 3, and the fourth with the number 6.
People's performance on this task is abysmal.
Studies by many researchers over many years have shown that only about 10% of subjects given the task complete it correctly.
Even when the language of the task is rephrased to pose a familiar-sounding problem,
like which train a subway rider should take to get to her destination,
people's performance remains strikingly poor.
Change one particular aspect of the task, however, and the percentage of participants getting it right shoots up to 75%.
What is that change?
Make it social.
In the social version of the task, participants are told,
You are serving at a bar and have to enforce the rule that if a person is drinking beer,
they must be 21 years of age or older.
The four cards shown here have information about the people sitting at the table.
One side of the card tells you what a person is drinking, and the other side tells their age.
Which card or cards must you turn over to see if the rule is being broken?
The puzzle, once so befuddling, now seems easily solved.
Some evolutionary psychologists have speculated that people do so much better on the social version of the waste and selection task
because natural selection has furnished our brains with a dedicated cheater detection module
specialized for the crucial task of spotting transgressors who are breaking the rules of the community.
It's more likely, however, that people so readily succeed at solving the puzzle in this form
simply because it is social in nature, and we are past masters at thinking about social relations.
Indeed, scientists have theorized that we humans developed our oversized brains
in order to deal with the complexity of our own social groups.
As a result of evolutionary pressures, each of us alive today possesses a specialized social brain
that is immensely powerful, says Matthew Lieberman, a psychologist at the University of California, Los Angeles.
The social brain, with its superpowers, as Lieberman calls them,
starts developing in early childhood.
In adolescence, it kicks into high gear.
Here, this map is going to be your guide to North Shore.
With these words, Janice Ian thrusts a piece of paper into the hands of a wide-eyed Katie Herron.
In the 2004 film Mean Girls, Katie, played by Lindsay Lohan, is the new girl at North Shore High School.
The first person she meets there is the wisecracking Janice, played by Lizzie Kaplan.
Janice takes it upon herself to show Katie the lay of the land as mapped out in her detailed diagram of the lunchroom.
Now, where you sit in the cafeteria is crucial, Janice explains, jabbing at the map in Katie's hand,
because you've got everybody there.
The camera pans over the groups gathered around their cafeteria tables
as Janice catalogs them in not-quite-politically-correct fashion.
You've got your freshmen, ROTC guys, preps, JV jocks, Asian nerds, cool Asians, varsity jocks,
unfriendly black hotties, girls who eat their feelings, girls who don't eat anything,
desperate wannabes, burnouts, sexually active band geeks,
and, Janice concludes with a note of scorn, the well-groomed girls she calls the plastics.
Beware of the plastics.
Almost every adolescent maintains a mental flowchart like the one Janice put down on paper.
Teens may not remember how to find the square root of a fraction
or recall all the elements on the periodic table,
but they can effortlessly explain and analyze the complicated social hierarchy
that prevails at their high school.
Starting with the launch of puberty,
young people become powerfully driven to form bonds with
and establish a place among their peers,
an activity that entails an almost obsessive focus on the intricacies of relationships.
They can't help it.
Structural and hormonal changes taking place in the brains of teenagers
persistently orient them toward the social sphere.
During adolescence, teens' brains become more sensitive to social and emotional cues,
responding more strongly to pictures of faces, for example,
than do the brains of children or adults.
Teenagers' brains also become more attuned to reward
as puberty prompts an increase in the activity of neural circuits
involved in the feel-good chemical dopamine.
And the sweetest reward for a teen is to be accepted and liked by her peers.
In the service of navigating a newly complex and valued interpersonal ecosystem,
the social brain appears to be turned on in teenagers nearly all the time.
Says Matthew Lieberman of UCLA,
what the brain really wants to do, particularly during adolescence,
is explore and master the social world.
Yet at this very moment in their development,
we tell teenagers to turn off their social brains when they arrive at school
and to focus instead on abstract information devoid of social meaning or context.
Teachers, parents, and other adults treat social life
as an unwelcome diversion from the real work at hand.
And in so doing, they set up a struggle for students' attention and effort.
The results are predictable.
Boredom, distraction, disengagement, even acting out.
Of course, we can't simply allow adolescents to attend to their social lives all day.
But we can leverage their burgeoning sociability
in the service of learning the material they need to learn.
How to do this?
One effective technique is to involve them in highly social relationships
in which academic content is also front and center.
That is, engage them in teaching others.
Given their well-advertised ambivalence about school,
deputizing teenagers to act as teachers may seem like a questionable prescription.
But that's just it.
While our species and its young did not evolve to care about the Pythagorean theorem
or the War of 1812,
we did evolve to educate others about the vital arcana of our particular tribe.
Think of how much informal teaching of adolescent social norms
goes on in the cafeteria or the student lounge.
As teachers, human beings are naturals.
We are born to instruct others and to learn from them.
Evidence of teaching has been found in the archaeological record,
reaching back hundreds of thousands of years.
And the act of teaching has been observed in every human culture around the world,
including the hunter-gatherer tribes that live today
in a fashion similar to that of our ancient forebears.
The teaching instinct manifests just as reliably among modern people like us.
In the course of everyday interactions, we unconsciously offer cues to others,
eye contact, a change in our tone of voice,
that signal our intent to instruct.
These cues, in turn, induce our social partners
to become more receptive to the information we have to convey.
Such signaling begins at birth.
Mothers and fathers of newborn babies
immediately start speaking to their infants in parentese,
a distinctively high-pitched, slowed-down, exaggerated way of talking.
Research has found that hearing parentese
helps infants and toddlers learn new words more readily
than hearing ordinary speech.
Before too long, children themselves are engaging in instruction.
Teaching behavior has been observed among toddlers
as young as three and a half years of age.
Across the lifespan,
engagement with other people orients us toward taking in new information.
But this reflexive adjustment may happen
only if we encounter those people in the flesh.
In a study using FNIR's brain-scanning technology,
a team of researchers at Yale University
found that an area of the social brain was activated
when adult participants looked directly into one another's eyes,
but not when they gazed at the eyes of others recorded on video.
Eye contact opens the gate between the perceptual systems
of two individuals and information flows,
says Joy Hirsch, the Yale neuroscientist who led the study.
Another factor that seems to gate or initiate the process of learning
is contingent communication,
social exchanges in which the utterances of one partner
are directly responsive to what the other has said.
When contingent communication is absent,
learning may simply fail to occur.
A particularly striking example,
toddlers under the age of two and a half
readily learn new words and actions from a responsive adult,
but pick up almost nothing from pre-recorded instruction
delivered on a screen,
a phenomenon that researchers call the video deficit.
Humans learn best from other, live humans.
Perhaps more surprising,
people learn from teaching other people,
often more than the pupils themselves absorb.
Consider this finding.
Firstborn children have an IQ
IQ that is on average 2.3 points higher
than that of their younger brothers and sisters.
After disconfirming several potential explanations,
such as better nutrition or differential parental treatment,
researchers concluded that firstborn children's higher IQs
stem from a simple fact of family life.
Older siblings engage in teaching younger ones.
Outside the family,
laboratory research and real-world programs
consistently show that engaging students
in tutoring their peers
has benefits for all involved,
and especially for the ones doing the teaching.
Why would the act of teaching produce learning
for the teacher?
The answer is that teaching is a deeply social act,
one that initiates a set of powerful cognitive,
attentional, and motivational processes
that have the effect of changing the way the teacher thinks.
One such process kicks in
even before the tutoring session begins.
Students who learn information
in preparation for teaching someone else
review the material more intensively
and organize it more thoroughly in their own minds
than do students who are learning the same information
in order to take a test.
For social creatures like us,
the prospect of engaging in an interpersonal interaction
with all of its potential for feeling admired or embarrassed
is far more motivating
than the relatively anonymous activity
of supplying written answers on an exam.
Likewise, social interactions with other people
alter our physiological state
in ways that enhance learning,
generating a state of energized alertness
that sharpens attention and reinforces memory.
Students who are studying on their own
experience no such boost in physiological arousal
and so easily become bored or distracted.
They may turn on music or open up Instagram
to give themselves a dose of the human emotion
and social stimulation they're missing.
More learning happens for the tutor
in the course of teaching.
When explaining academic content,
the tutor is forced to make explicit
the details she might herself have glossed over.
The gaps in her own knowledge
and understanding become visible.
When directing the tutee
to the most important aspects of the subject
and drawing connections among these features,
the tutor is herself led to engage
in a deeper level of mental processing.
When fielding the pupil's questions
and posing questions of her own,
the tutor is obliged to adopt
a metacognitive stance toward the material,
consciously monitoring what her pupil knows
and what she herself knows.
Researchers have found that while students
often possess the mental tools required
to understand challenging academic content,
they simply don't apply them
when studying on their own.
When placed in the role of teacher, however,
students are compelled to put those tools to use
with previously unrealized benefits
for their own learning.
So powerful is the teacher role, in fact,
that some of its cognitive effects
can be evoked even when one's students don't exist.
Vincent Hoogerheide,
an assistant professor of education
at Utrecht University in the Netherlands,
has conducted several studies
in which participants are asked
to explain academic content on camera
to an imagined audience.
After studying the material themselves,
participants create a short video lesson
on the calculation of probability, for example,
or on syllogistic reasoning,
among other subjects.
No tutee is in attendance
and there is no tutor-tutee interaction.
And yet, Hoogerheide has found,
the act of teaching on video
enhances the teacher's own learning,
improves her test performance,
and enhances her ability
to transfer the learned information
to new situations.
Writing out an explanation
of the same material for an imagined tutee
does not generate the same gains.
Hoogerheide theorizes
that teaching on camera
generates persuasive feelings
of social presence,
the sense that there is someone
watching and listening.
Explaining oneself while being recorded,
he notes,
measurably increases
the explainer's physiological arousal,
a state that is associated
with enhanced memory,
attention, and alertness.
Face-to-face interaction
between teacher and student
remains the ideal, however,
and it produces benefits
that go beyond academics.
The act of teaching
can positively affect
students' identity and self-image,
as demonstrated by a number
of real-world peer tutoring programs.
For example,
a non-profit initiative
called the Valued Youth Partnership.
Though we might imagine
that tutors should be drawn
from the ranks
of the most accomplished students,
Valued Youth does just the opposite.
It deliberately recruits
struggling students
and assigns them
to teach younger kids.
Evaluations of the program
show that students
who engage in tutoring
earn higher grades,
attend school more consistently,
and stay enrolled
at higher rates
than similar students
who do not participate.
Such outcomes
may be due in part
to the experience
of what psychologists call
productive agency,
the sense that one's own actions
are affecting another person
in a beneficial way.
Actually seeing the fruits
of one's labor
is especially gratifying.
Research finds that tutors
learn more
and derive more motivation
from a tutoring session
when they have the opportunity
to watch their tutees
answer questions
about what they've learned.
The experience of teaching others
can also help tutors
become more fully integrated
into an academic
or professional community.
The summer pre-med program,
operated out of the medical school
at the University of California, Irvine,
enlists African-American
and Latino medical students
to teach college students
who are themselves
members of minority groups.
The undergraduates, in turn,
teach students from Irvine's
predominantly Black
and Latino public high schools.
Started in 2010,
the program has been shown
to enhance the self-confidence
and motivation
of all three tiers of students.
This cascading mentorship model,
in which participants
both teach and are taught,
shows promise in many settings,
including the workplace.
Just as students benefit
from teaching their classmates,
professionals gain
from advising their colleagues.
Holly Chu,
an associate professor
of business management
at Brooklyn College,
reported in a study
published in 2018
that employees who engage
in sharing job-related knowledge
with their coworkers
enlarge their own expertise
in the bargain.
By systematically going
through the knowledge,
examining it,
understanding it,
integrating it,
and presenting it,
Chu notes,
these workers increased
the depth and breadth
of their knowledge
and subsequently turned in
job performances
that were rated more highly
by their supervisors.
Far from being frivolous
or unserious,
social interaction
is a vital complement
to intellectual activity,
activating aptitudes
and capabilities
that might otherwise
remain unused.
But because the brain-bound
approach to cognition
regards information
as information,
no matter how it is encountered,
the social element
of thinking
is often sacrificed
in the name of efficiency
and convenience.
The spread of technology
into education
and the workplace
has reinforced this tendency
as students are asked
to learn mathematical operations
from Khan Academy videos
and employees are expected
to train themselves
using online resources.
But technology could be used
in another fashion
to promote the kind
of in-person social exchanges
that do so much
to extend our mental capacities.
For example,
Family Playlists,
a tool developed
by the education nonprofit
Power My Learning.
After being introduced
to a concept at school,
students are directed
to take their new knowledge home
and teach it to their parents
or other relatives
or caregivers.
Family Playlists
provide support
by sending
the family partners
a link
via a text message.
The link takes them
to a webpage
describing the collaborative
learning activity
in which they are
to participate.
Family members
use this same platform
to provide feedback
to their child's teacher
about how well
the child understood
and explained the lesson.
Power My Learning
has now implemented
Family Playlists
in more than 100 schools
nationwide.
The organization's CEO,
Elizabeth Stock,
notes that an internal
research study found
that students using the tool
made gains in math
equivalent to four months
of additional learning.
Even more important,
she adds,
teachers report
that their relationships
with students' families
have improved
and students themselves
are more engaged
and enthusiastic
about learning.
Teaching is a mode
of social interaction
we can deliberately deploy
in order to think
more intelligently.
There's another form
of social exchange
that we can use
to our advantage,
one that comes
just as naturally
to the human animal.
Arguing.
The study was
positively devilish
in its design.
Participants were asked
first to solve
a series of logic puzzles.
A produce shop
sells a variety
of fruits and vegetables,
some of which
are organic
and some of which
are not.
The apples sold
by this shop
are not organic.
Which of the following
statements
about the shop's
wares are true?
Provide a reason
for each answer.
1.
All the fruits
are organic.
2.
None of the fruits
are organic.
3.
Some of the fruits
are organic.
4.
Some of the fruits
are not organic.
5.
We cannot tell
anything for sure
about whether
the fruits
in this shop
are organic.
After solving
the puzzles,
study participants
were then asked
to evaluate
the responses
provided by
other participants,
that is,
to judge whether
the reasons
given by others
seemed valid or not.
The trick?
One of the answers
presented
in this second round
did not issue
from someone else.
but rather
was an answer
the participant
herself had supplied
in the first round.
Some participants
recognized their own
response,
but many others
did not.
What happened next
was fascinating.
More than half
of those who believed
they were evaluating
someone else's response
rejected as invalid
the answer
they themselves
had put forth.
They were especially
likely to reject
their own response
when they had,
in fact,
offered a logically
invalid answer
originally.
In other words,
they applied
more critical analysis
to what they thought
were other people's
arguments
than to their own,
and this scrutiny
made them more accurate.
There was a purpose
behind the deviousness
of the researchers
who designed this study.
Hugo Mercier,
a cognitive scientist
at the National Center
for Scientific Research,
CNRS,
CNRS,
in Paris,
and his co-authors
were out to expose
the peculiar nature
of human reason.
As we've seen,
people often perform
poorly when asked
to think
in a logical fashion.
Recall that fewer
than 10% of people
who take the standard,
non-social form
of the Waisen
selection task
complete it correctly.
Performance on other
standardized measures
of reading,
like the thinking skills
assessment
and the cognitive
reflection test,
is similarly mediocre,
even among people
who are generally
well-educated,
and even among people
who have been
expressly trained
in argumentation
and rhetoric.
An entire academic field
is devoted to cataloging
the cognitive biases
and other mental distortions
that interfere
with rational thinking.
There is our well-documented
confirmation bias,
for example,
the tendency
to selectively
seek out and believe
evidence that supports
our prior beliefs.
Originally named
by none other than
Peter Waisen,
confirmation bias
has been further elaborated
by the psychologist
Daniel Kahneman.
In his 2011 book
Thinking Fast and Slow,
Kahneman observed,
contrary to the rules
of philosophers of science
who advise testing hypotheses
by trying to refute them,
people,
and scientists,
quite often,
seek data
that are likely
to be compatible
with the beliefs
they currently hold.
The human mind,
he lamented,
is a machine
for jumping to conclusions.
But why should this be so?
Why would the most
intelligent creatures
on the planet
be hobbled
by these built-in
mental defects?
Kahneman and others
who study cognitive biases
have no convincing answer
to this question,
according to Hugo Mercier.
They treat human reason
as if it were
a flawed superpower,
at once impressively capable
and strangely prone
to breaking down.
In the view
of these psychologists,
such glitches
in the mind's ability
to reason
are inherent
and unavoidable.
The most we can do,
they say,
is to remain alert
for the emergence
of bias
and then endeavor
to correct it.
Mercier begs to differ.
With his collaborator,
Dan Sperber,
also a cognitive scientist
at CNRS,
he has proposed
a provocative alternative,
different in its explanation
for reasons afflictions
and different
in its recommended remedy.
We did not evolve
to solve tricky logic problems
on our own,
they point out,
and so we shouldn't
be surprised
by the fact
that we're no good
at it,
any more than
by the fact
that we're no good
at breathing underwater.
What we did evolve
to do
is persuade
other people
of our views
and to guard
against being misled
by others.
Reasoning
is a social activity,
in other words,
and should be practiced
as such.
Mercier's
and Sperber's premise,
which they advanced
in their 2017 book,
The Enigma of Reason,
makes coherent sense
of the very aspects
of human thought
that have seemed
so confounding.
The fact that people
are capable
of stringently evaluating
the validity of arguments,
along with the fact
that they so often
fail to do so
when the arguments
are their own.
Both tendencies
are fully predicted
by the author's
argumentative theory
of reasoning.
We have every incentive
to closely examine
the arguments of others
who might be out
to exploit
or manipulate us
for their own ends,
but few inducements
to scrutinize
the arguments
we make ourselves.
After all,
being completely convinced
of the merits
of our case
can only make us
more credible
to others.
And expending
a lot of effort
on picking apart
our own argument
isn't necessary,
not when we can rely
on our sparring partner
to conduct
the audit for us.
The argumentative theory
also makes
specific predictions
about the conditions
in which reason
will function best,
such as,
the weaknesses
of our reasoning faculty
will be most evident
when we use it
outside the context
in which it involved.
That context
is raucously,
noisily social.
When we reason alone,
inside our own heads,
we will be dangerously
vulnerable
to confirmation bias,
constructing the strongest case
for our own point of view
and fooling ourselves
in the process.
Of course,
in our brain-bound culture,
thinking alone
is how thinking
is usually done,
with predictably
disappointing results.
Mercier and Sperber
urge a different approach,
arguing together,
with the aim
of arriving jointly
at something
close to the truth.
Arguing together
is something
Brad Bird
and his frequent collaborator,
John Walker,
have turned into
an art form.
Bird is the Academy Award-winning
director of Pixar movies
like Ratatouille
and The Incredibles.
Walker is the producer
who helped manage
the making of these
and other films.
The two are famous
for fighting openly,
Bird has acknowledged,
because he's got
to get it done
and I've got to make it
as good as it can be
before it gets done.
Some of the arguments
they had while creating
The Incredibles
were so epic
that they made it
onto the bonus materials
included in the movie's DVD.
Look, I'm just trying
to get us across the line,
yells Walker
in one moment
captured by the camera.
Bird hollers back,
I'm trying to get us
across the line
in first place.
In an interview
that took place
after the movie's release,
Bird explained
that he counts
on Walker
to push back
against the arguments
he makes,
saying of his producer,
I don't want him
to tell me
whatever you want, Brad.
I love working with John
because he'll give me
the bad news
straight to my face.
Ultimately,
we both win.
If you ask within Pixar,
we're known
as being efficient.
Our movies aren't cheap,
but the money gets
on the screen
because we're open
in our conflict.
Stanford University
Business School
professor Robert Sutton
conducted the interview
with Bird,
whom he calls
a vigorous practitioner
of creative abrasion.
Bird is on the right track
with his approach,
says Sutton.
A pile of studies
show that when people
fight over ideas
and do so
with mutual respect,
they are more productive
and creative.
Indeed,
research has consistently
found that argument,
when conducted
in the right way,
produces deeper learning,
sounder decisions,
and more innovative solutions,
not to mention
better movies.
Why does arguing
help us think better?
Hugo Mercier
and Dan Sperber
have their theory.
Engaging in active debate
puts us in the position
of evaluating
others' arguments,
not simply constructing
and promoting
our own.
Such objective analysis,
unclouded by self-interested
confirmation bias,
makes the most
of humans'
discriminating intelligence.
But there are
additional reasons
why confrontations
enhance our cognition,
reasons that are likewise
rooted deep
in human nature.
For example,
there's the simple fact
that conflict
irresistibly seizes
our attention
and motivates us
to learn more.
We would probably
put down a novel
or switch off a movie
that didn't introduce
conflict early on,
whether that conflict
centers on a resolute
hero battling the odds,
two lovers separated
by fate,
or a looming disaster
that might yet be averted.
The drama inherent
in conflict
is what keeps us
reading or watching.
Yet we expect
students and employees
to attend to information
that's been drained
of conflict,
blandly presented
as the established
account or consensus view.
In fact,
almost every topic
can be cast in terms
that highlight
opposing perspectives,
and should be,
according to David Johnson,
a psychologist
at the University
of Minnesota.
It is
a general rule
of teaching,
he has written,
that if an instructor
does not create
an intellectual conflict
within the first
few minutes of class,
students won't engage
with the lesson.
Johnson has spent
decades investigating
the uses of what
he calls
constructive controversy
or the open-minded
exploration of diverging
ideas and beliefs.
In his studies,
Johnson has found
that students who are
drawn into an
intellectual dispute
read more library books,
review more
classroom materials,
and seek out
more information
from others in the know.
Conflict creates
uncertainty.
Who's wrong?
Who's right?
An ambiguity
that we feel compelled
to resolve
by acquiring
more facts.
Intellectual clashes
can also generate
what psychologists
call the
accountability effect.
Just as students
prepare more assiduously
when they know
they'll be teaching
the material to others,
people who know
they'll be called on
to defend their views
marshal stronger points
and support them
with more and better
evidence
than people who
anticipate merely
presenting their opinions
in writing.
Once the debate
has begun,
the act of arguing
enhances thinking
in an additional way.
It relieves
cognitive load
by effectively
distributing
intellectual positions
among the disputants.
While an individual
reasoning alone
must keep in mind
the details
of each claim
she contemplates,
the person who
argues with others
can divide that task
among her fellow
debaters,
allowing each person
to stand in
for a particular
point of view.
Relieved of the burden
of carrying on
a debate
inside her own head,
she has more
mental resources
to devote
to evaluating
the arguments
on their merits.
The ability
to argue
emerges early
in life,
as any parent knows.
Children as young
as two or three
are capable
of producing
justifications
and constructing
arguments
when they find
themselves at odds
with their parents
or siblings.
As they acquire
more language,
cognitive skills,
and social knowledge
about rules and rights,
children become
increasingly effective
advocates for their
own points of view,
notes Nancy Stein,
a psychologist
at the University
of Chicago
who studies
the development
of argumentative
thinking.
The ability
to critically evaluate
others' arguments,
to distinguish
strong claims
from weak ones,
also emerges
early in childhood.
We are natural-born
arguers,
in Hugo Mercier's
phrase,
and we can
deliberately deploy
that innate capacity
to correct our mistakes,
clarify our thinking,
and reach sounder decisions.
The key is to
approach the act
of arguing
with the aim
not of winning
at all costs,
but of reaching
the truth
through a vigorous
process of advancing
claims and evaluating
counterclaims.
We use argument
to its full advantage
when we make
the best case
for our own position
while granting
the points lodged
against it,
when we energetically
critique our partner's
position while remaining
open to its potential
virtues.
According to Robert Sutton,
the Stanford Business
School professor,
we should endeavor
to offer
strong opinions
weakly held.
Put another way,
he says,
people should fight
as if they're right
and listen
as if they are wrong.
Listening
and telling
is at the heart
of one more way
we can use
social interaction
to enhance our thinking
through the exchange
of stories.
All of the 7th
and 8th grade students
enrolled in a 2012
study of educational
methods
were learning about
the science
of radioactive elements.
The manner in which
they encountered
the subject,
however,
was strikingly different.
One group
was given
an account
written in the
soporifically dull
style of a textbook.
Elements are
individual pieces
of matter
that combine
with each other
and make up
everything we see
around us.
Most of what we see
and use in the world
like air and water
is not made up
of one single element.
For example,
sodium and chlorine
are two different elements
that make up
the salt we use
for cooking.
And on it droned,
adding,
we now know
of 92 elements
that are a natural
part of the earth.
A second group
of students
learned the same
material,
but with a twist.
Their version
of the account
picked up the thread
this way.
By the late 1800s,
scientists had already
found most of these
elements,
but some were yet
to be discovered.
At this time,
Polish-born
Marie Curie
and her French husband,
Pierre,
were two chemists
living in France
trying to find
all of Earth's
natural elements.
Although it was
very hard
detective work,
Marie and Pierre
loved solving
the mysteries
of elements.
One day,
a fellow scientist
named Henri Becquerel
showed Marie
and Pierre
a special kind
of rock
called pitchblende.
When Henri
took this pitchblende
rock into a dark room,
Marie could see
that it gave off
a light blue glow.
This second account
continued.
Henri explained
that the pitchblende
had a lot of the element
called uranium
and that he believed
that the glow
came from the uranium.
Certainly,
this was one
of the strangest rocks
that Marie and Pierre
had ever seen,
which is why
they wanted to learn
as much as possible
about the mysterious
blue glow
and whether it came
from the uranium.
The second group
of students
went on to hear
about how Marie
and Pierre
crushed the rock
into tiny pieces,
how they burned it
at different temperatures
and added different
kinds of acid
to see what would happen.
They read about
how the two scientists
discovered that the uranium
in the rock
was emitting
energetic particles,
a property they named
radioactivity.
And the students
were told,
while working with
excitement and hope
for developing
a brand new element,
Pierre and Marie
noticed that they
were beginning
to feel tired
and sick,
the effects
of radiation poisoning.
Study author
Diana Arya,
an assistant professor
of education
at the University
of California,
Santa Barbara,
wanted to see
whether the difference
in presentation
would produce
a difference
in learning.
It did.
Students understood
the material more thoroughly
and remembered it
more accurately
when it was given
to them
in the form
of a story,
in particular,
a story that captured
the human motives
and choices
that lay behind
the creation
of what is now
well-established knowledge.
Arya notes
that it's not the case
that the second version
was artificially imbued
with narrative drama.
Rather,
it's the conventional text
that has been stripped
of a sense
of the feelings
of importance
and intrigue
that originally
inspired the discovery.
Alas,
such conventional texts,
devoid of human stories
and human sentiment,
make up the bulk
of the information
students encounter
in school,
and for that matter,
of the information
employees encounter
in the workplace.
This depersonalized approach,
as other educational
psychologists
have called it,
fails to take advantage
of the distinctive power
wielded by narrative.
Cognitive scientists
refer to stories
as psychologically privileged,
meaning they are granted
special treatment
by our brains.
Compared to other
informational formats,
we attend to stories
more closely,
we understand them
more readily,
and we remember them
more accurately.
Research has found
that we recall
as much as 50%
more information
from stories
than from expository passages.
Why do stories
exert these effects on us?
One reason is that stories
shape the way
information is shared
in cognitively
congenial ways.
The human brain
has evolved
to seek out evidence
of causal relationships.
This happened
because of that.
Stories are,
by their nature,
all about causal relationships.
Event A
leads to event B,
which in turn
causes event C,
and so on.
If a speaker
were to relate a story
in which the first part
of the tale
had no bearing
on the second part,
listeners would
justifiably protest
that this so-called
story made no sense.
At the same time,
stories don't spell
everything out for us,
either.
If a storyteller
were to laboriously
connect every narrative dot,
listeners would again
rightly object,
okay, we get it.
When stories are told well,
only the highlights
are included,
leaving listeners
to fill in the causal
inferences that lend
the story its full meaning.
Such inferences require
some mental effort,
though not too much,
making stories enjoyable
to listen to
and think about.
But precisely because
we do have to think
about stories
in order to understand them,
do have to maintain
a mental chain of events
that links beginning,
middle, and end,
we're more likely
to remember stories
than to remember
information that doesn't
require such
cognitive processing.
There's another reason
why stories affect us
more deeply
than non-narrative
forms of information.
When we listen to a story,
our brains experience
the action
as if it were
happening to us.
Brain scanning studies
show that when we hear
about characters emoting,
the emotional areas
of our brains
become active.
When we hear about
characters moving vigorously,
the motor regions
of our brains
are roused.
We even tend to remember
what characters
in a story
are said to remember
and forget
what the characters forget.
On the basis
of such evidence,
researchers have concluded
that we understand stories
by running a simulation
of them in our minds.
Because stories
by their nature
feature human actors
carrying out
observable actions,
our brains generate
a mental movie
of the events,
an imaginary film strip
that doesn't unfurl
when we're reading
a set of facts
or instructions.
Such simulations
offer a kind of practice
by proxy.
The experiences
we hear about
in stories
didn't happen to us,
but thanks to
the mental dress rehearsal
we conduct
as we listen,
we'll be better prepared
when they do.
Christopher Myers
witnessed this phenomenon
firsthand
in the course
of conducting
an unusual form
of academic research.
Myers,
an assistant professor
of management
and organization
at Johns Hopkins University's
Cary Business School,
has logged many hours
in the air
watching medical
transport teams
at work.
These nurses
and paramedics
travel by helicopter
to pick up patients
from the scene
of an accident
or from small
community hospitals,
ferrying them
to larger facilities
for advanced care.
On the way,
they administer treatment
for a staggeringly
wide range
of illnesses
and injuries.
No single member
of the medical
transport team
could possibly claim
firsthand experience
of every condition
for which the team
must provide care,
forcing them
to rely
on the accumulated
expertise
of their teammates.
And the way
this expertise
is shared,
Myers discovered,
is largely
through narrative.
During months
of fly-alongs,
he observed
that much
of the knowledge
held by flight nurses
was acquired
not in formal
training sessions,
nor from guidebooks
or manuals,
but through
informal storytelling
in the downtime
between missions.
I don't want to read
about toxic shock syndrome
in a book,
one nurse said to Myers.
Tell me about the case
you've just flown.
What symptoms
did he present?
What did it look like?
What did you do for him?
We have protocols,
but what if you guys
added something
that wasn't in the protocol?
Tell me why.
Did it work?
Team members
regularly related
stories to one another
about technical problems
they had encountered
with the helicopter's
equipment,
about interpersonal
issues they had
confronted in taking
over patient care
from the staff
at various hospitals,
and, of course,
about medical procedures
they had performed
or witnessed.
There was,
for example,
the tale of a patient
who had fallen off
a balcony at a wedding
and impaled herself
on the wedding singer's
microphone stand.
The story of how
the medical transport team
successfully treated
her injuries
reoccurred to a flight nurse
years later
when her own team
was called upon
to help a bicyclist
whose torso was impaled
on one of his handlebars.
I had never actually
seen something like that
before,
the nurse told Myers
about the bicycle injury.
But I'd heard
the microphone stand story,
and so when we showed up
on the scene,
it just kind of kicked in,
like,
well,
this is what they did
with her,
so this is a good place
to start.
As Myers points out,
such vicarious learning
is increasingly necessary
across any number
of industries.
The variety
of unanticipated scenarios
that may arise
at a given moment
is too great
for any individual
to have had
direct experience
with them all.
Pressed by
unfamiliar circumstances,
workers may have
no time to page
through a procedural manual
or even to search
for answers online.
A trial-and-error approach
is also too time-consuming
and too risky.
But the professional
who is in the habit
of exchanging stories
with coworkers
has a deep well
of vicarious experience
on which to draw.
The medical transport teams
studied by Myers
fly more than
1,600 missions a year.
An individual nurse
typically serves
on a small fraction
of these,
perhaps 200.
As one of them
told Myers,
listening to his
colleague's stories
gave him access
to 1,400 experiences
a year
that I don't have
personally.
The more you know
about those other patients,
the more you're ready
for the next one.
Narratives emerge
organically
in our communications
with others.
The role for leaders
and managers
lies in offering
supports for
and removing barriers
to
the storytelling
in which their people
would naturally engage.
Two of the most
important allowances
that higher-ups
can provide
are time
and space.
In his research
with transport nurses,
Christopher Myers
learned that stories
weren't usually shared
during the crush
of a work shift.
A nurse he interviewed
told him,
there's too much going on
for there to be a,
hey, listen to this story,
or this happened
and this.
It seems to be
a more informal thing
that happens
when you're sitting around
sharing war stories.
Some supervisors
may look askance
at such sitting around,
but research shows
it's time well spent.
One study found,
for example,
that a 1% reduction
in efficiency,
allowing time
for unstructured
employee interaction,
produces a three-fold
increase in group
performance
over the long term.
During such interaction,
it may seem as though
employees are simply
exchanging gossip.
But what is gossip?
asks Sandy Pentland,
a computational scientist
and MIT professor
who has conducted
many studies
demonstrating the benefits
of workplace interaction.
Gossip is stories
about what happened
and what you did
in response.
He adds,
if you think about
what needs to happen
for a healthy organization,
people need to know
the rules of the road.
They need to know
how things are done,
which means
they have to hear
the stories.
The space
where such interactions
unfold
is also important.
In the case
of the medical
transport teams
Myers studied,
the designated
storytelling locale
was a 10-by-15-foot area
near the door
to the helipad,
just outside
a supply room.
Over time,
this unassuming spot
became the unofficial site
for trading
job-related anecdotes.
The informality
of the space
was part of the appeal
and part of its value.
Myers notes
that there was
another,
more formal space
set aside
for the transport
nurses to share stories,
the weekly
doctor-supervised meetings
known as
Grand Rounds.
The patient case studies
presented at these meetings
were cleaner,
he reports,
more focused
and concise
than the stories
recounted
outside the supply room.
But in polishing
up their narratives,
the nurses
often omitted
just those details
that would be
most useful
to their colleagues
should they encounter
a similar situation
in the future.
Such nitty-gritty details
constitute what psychologists
call tacit knowledge,
information about
how things are done,
when,
and under which circumstances.
It's what gets left out
of the depersonalized
information
employees encounter
in more formal meetings
and training sessions.
It's also where
the knowledge management systems
in which so many firms
have invested
go wrong.
The information
such systems
make available
is devoid of context,
stripped of detail,
and thereby rendered
all but useless.
Much of the knowledge
needed for employees
to learn and thrive
at work
is not the kind
of formal,
codified information
that is typically
documented
in online repositories
or knowledge management
systems,
Myers notes.
Instead,
what is often
critical for success
is mastery
of the tacit knowledge
of the organization,
the complex,
often subtle
interpretive knowledge
that is difficult
to capture
or write down.
The disappointing
track record
of such repositories
makes Myers think
of another interview
he conducted,
this one with a professional
at a large tech company.
This employee's organization
had invested
millions of dollars
in a sophisticated
knowledge management system
intended to codify
the experience
held inside the heads
of the company's workforce.
I use the knowledge
management system
all the time,
he assured Myers,
but not in the way
the company's leaders
intended.
I just scroll down
to the bottom
of the entry
to see who wrote it
and then I call them
on the phone.
What this individual
is seeking
is richly contextualized
information
full of detail
and nuance.
What he's looking for,
in short,
is a story.
Chapter 9
Thinking with Groups
After several days
conducting military drills
off the coast
of California,
the USS Palau
was headed home.
The massive aircraft carrier,
large enough
to transport
25 helicopters,
was steaming
into San Diego Harbor
at a brisk clip.
Inside the pilot house,
located on the navigation bridge
two levels up
from the flight deck,
the mood was buoyant.
Members of the crew
would soon be disembarking
and enjoying themselves
on shore.
Conversation turned
to where they would go
for dinner that night.
Then, suddenly,
the intercom erupted
with the voice
of the ship's engineer.
Bridge,
main control,
he barked.
I am losing
steam drum pressure.
No apparent cause.
I'm shutting
my throttles.
A junior officer,
working under
the supervision
of the ship's navigator,
moved quickly
to the intercom
and spoke into it,
acknowledging,
shuttling throttles,
aye.
The navigator himself
turned to the captain,
seated on the port side
of the pilot house.
Captain,
the engineer is losing
steam on the boiler
for no apparent cause,
he repeated.
Everyone present
knew the message
was urgent.
Losing steam pressure
effectively meant
losing power
throughout the ship.
The consequences
of this unexpected
development
soon made themselves evident.
Just 40 seconds
after the engineer's report,
the steam drum
had emptied
and all steam-operated
systems ground
to a halt.
A high-pitched alarm
sounded for a few seconds,
then the bridge
fell eerily quiet
as the electric motors
in the radars
and other devices
spun down
and stopped.
But losing electrical power
was not the full extent
of the emergency.
A lack of steam
meant the crew
had no ability
to slow the ship's
rate of speed.
The ship was moving
too fast to drop anchor.
The only way
to reduce its momentum
would have been
to reverse the ship's propeller,
operated, of course,
by steam.
On top of that,
loss of steam
hobbled the crew's ability
to steer the ship,
another consequence
that soon became
painfully evident.
Gazing anxiously
out over the bow
of the ship,
the navigator
told the helmsman
to turn the rudder
to the right
ten degrees.
The helmsman
spun the wheel,
but to no effect.
Sir, I have no helm, sir,
he exclaimed.
The helm did have
a manual backup system,
two men sweating
in a compartment
in the stern of the ship,
exerting all their might
to move the unyielding rudder
even an inch.
The navigator,
still gazing out
over the bow,
whispered,
come on,
damn it,
swing.
But the 17,000-ton ship
sailed on,
now veering far off
its original course
and headed for the crowded
San Diego harbor.
Watching all of this unfold
in real time
was Edwin Hutchins.
Hutchins was a psychologist
employed by the Naval Personnel
Research and Development Center
in San Diego.
He had boarded the Palau
as an observer
conducting a study,
taking notes
and tape-recording conversations.
Now the ship
was roiled by a crisis,
a casualty,
in the cruise lingo,
and Hutchins
was along for the ride.
From his corner
of the pilot house,
Hutchins looked over
at the cruise leader.
The captain, he noted,
was acting calm,
as if all this were routine.
In fact, Hutchins knew
the situation
was anything but routine.
The occasional cracking voice,
a muttered curse,
the removal of a jacket
that revealed
a perspiration-soaked shirt
on this cool spring afternoon
told the real story.
The Palau was not
fully under control
and careers,
and possibly lives,
were in jeopardy.
Hutchins used his time
aboard the ship
to study a phenomenon
he calls
socially distributed cognition,
or the way people think
with the minds of others.
His aim, he later wrote,
was to move the boundaries
of the cognitive unit
of analysis
out beyond the skin
of the individual person
and treat the navigation team
as a cognitive
and computational system.
Such systems,
Hutchins added,
may have interesting
cognitive properties
of their own.
Faced with a predicament
that no single mind
could resolve,
the socially distributed
cognition
of the Palau's crew
was about to be put
to the test.
Among the downstream effects
of the steam engine malfunction
was the failure
of the gyrocompass,
the principal tool
relied upon
by the Palau's
navigation team.
Without the gyrocompass,
the team had to manually
ascertain the position
of the ship,
calculating the relationship
among bearings
taken from multiple
landmarks on shore.
And because the Palau's
position was a moving target,
this calculation
had to be generated
once every minute.
The ship's quartermaster chief,
a man named Richards,
got down to work
at the chart table
in the pilot house,
but it soon became clear
that the job
was too much
for one brain to handle.
At first,
Hutchins observed,
Richards reached for ways
to spread the burden
of the task
across his own body
and across the tools
he had at hand.
He sub-vocally rehearsed
the numbers
he was computing,
repeating the digits
under his breath,
using his voice
and his auditory sense
to expand the capacity
of his working memory.
He traced the columns
of numbers being added
with his fingertip,
using his hand
to help keep track
of the masses
of information
he was managing.
With a pencil,
he jotted down
intermediate sums
in the margin
of the navigation chart,
fixing in place
a kind of
external memory
in Hutchins' phrase.
And he pulled out
a calculator,
using it
to relieve
his brain
of the burden
of carrying out
mathematical operations.
Still,
laboring on his own,
Richards began
to fall behind.
He recruited
yet one more resource,
the mental ability
of his teammate,
quartermaster
second class Silver.
The addition
of another mind
created a new challenge,
however,
how to figure out
on the fly
the best way
to divide up
the complex
and fast-paced task.
All the while,
the ship
kept moving,
and now
a new emergency
arose.
The Palau
was bearing down
on a sailboat,
a small craft
whose occupants
were oblivious
to the bigger
ship's dire condition.
Normally,
the Palau
would have sounded
five blasts
with its enormous horn,
Hutchins noted.
But the Palau's whistle
was a steam whistle,
and without steam pressure,
it was mute.
On board the ship
was a small manual foghorn,
basically a bicycle pump
with a reed and a bell,
in Hutchins's description.
A junior officer,
the keeper of the deck log,
was sent running
to find the foghorn,
take it out to the bow,
and let it sound.
Meanwhile,
the captain gripped
the microphone
for the flight deck's
public address system
and spoke into it.
Sailboat crossing Palau's bow,
be advised that
I have no power.
You cross at your own risk.
I have no power.
By this time,
the sailboat had disappeared
under the Palau's bow.
Only the tip of its sail
was visible
from the pilot house.
The crew braced
for the impending collision.
The keeper of the deck log
reached the bow at last
and let out
five feeble honks,
surely too late
to do any good.
But a few seconds later,
the sailboat emerged,
still sailing
from under the starboard bow.
One casualty,
at least,
averted.
Back inside the pilot house
Richards and Silver
were still huddled
over the chart table,
struggling to apportion
the task between them.
According to Hutchinson's
scrupulous observations,
the pair made
32 attempts
before a consistent
pattern of action appeared
and an effective
division of labor
between the two men
was established.
On try 33,
he noted,
they perform
what will be
the stable configuration
for the first time.
Once this configuration
was in place,
the teammates settled
into a rhythm,
taking in new bearing data
and churning out
new position calculations.
With their coordinated efforts
and those of the rest
of the crew,
the huge ship
was guided to safety.
25 minutes after
the engineering casualty
and more than two miles
from where the wild ride
had begun,
the Palau was brought
to anchor
at the intended location
in ample water
just outside the bounds
of the navigation channel,
Hutchins reported.
The safe arrival
of the Palau at anchor
was due in large part
to the exceptional seamanship
of the bridge crew,
he continued.
But no single individual
in the bridge acting alone,
neither the captain
nor the navigator
nor the quartermaster chief
supervising the navigation team,
could have kept control
of the ship
and brought it safely to anchor.
A psychologist
on the lookout
for socially distributed cognition
could hardly have chanced
upon a better example.
Too often, however,
we're not alert
to such instances
of collective thought.
Our culture
and our institutions
tend to fixate
on the individual,
on his uniqueness,
his distinctiveness,
his independence from others.
In business and education,
in public and private life,
we emphasize individual competition
over joint cooperation.
We resist what we consider conformity,
at least in its overt,
organized form,
and we look with suspicion
on what we call groupthink.
In some measure,
this wariness may be justified.
Uncritical groupthinking
can lead to foolish
and even disastrous decisions.
But the limitations
of excessive
cognitive individualism
are becoming
increasingly clear
as well.
Individual cognition
is simply not sufficient
to meet the challenges
of a world
in which information
is so abundant,
expertise
is so specialized,
and issues
are so complex.
In this milieu,
a single mind
laboring on its own
is at a distinct disadvantage
in solving problems
or generating
new ideas.
something beyond
solo thinking
is required,
the generation
of a state
that is entirely natural
to us as a species
and yet one
that has come to seem
quite strange and exotic,
the group mind.
How does
a group of minds
think as one?
It can seem mysterious
or even magical.
Indeed,
the study of the group mind
by Western science
got off to a dubious start
in this regard,
a relatively recent
historical interlude
that,
on top of our culture's
long-standing ideological
commitment to individualism,
helps explain the unease
with which the group mind
is often regarded.
The episode in question
got underway
in the late 19th
and early 20th centuries,
a period when
the day's intellectuals,
such as the French physician
Gustave Le Bon
and the British psychologist
William MacDougall,
conceived a fascination
with the way
crowds of people
seemed to have minds
of their own.
The group mind
was believed
to be powerful
but also dangerous,
primitive,
irrational,
incipiently violent.
Significantly,
it was also assumed
that the group
was less intelligent
than the individual.
Complex ideas
are only accessible
to crowds
after having assumed
a very simple shape,
asserted Le Bon
in The Crowd,
a study of the popular mind,
first published in 1895.
It is especially
when we are dealing
with somewhat lofty
philosophic
or scientific ideas
that we see
how far-reaching
are the modifications
they require
in order to lower them
to the level
of the intelligence
of crowds,
he wrote.
MacDougall
sounded a similar note
in The Group Mind,
a sketch
of the principles
of collective psychology,
published in 1920.
Not only mobs
or simple crowds,
but such bodies
as juries,
committees,
corporations
of all sorts,
which are partially
organized groups,
are notoriously liable
to pass judgments,
to form decisions,
to enact rules
or laws
so obviously erroneous,
unwise,
or defective
that anyone,
even the least
intelligent member
of the group concerned,
might have been expected
to produce
a better result,
he averred.
This conception
of the group mind
was hugely influential.
Its echoes
linger today
in our prevailing distrust
and even disparagement
of group thinking.
But the field
rested on shaky
empirical foundations.
Without a way
to explain
how the group mind
operated,
its theorists
turned to vague,
unscientific,
and even
supernatural
speculation.
Le Bon conjectured
about a
magnetic influence
at work
within crowds.
McDougal mused
about the possibility
of telepathic
communication.
Even the psychoanalyst
Carl Jung
got into the act,
advancing the notion
of a shared
genetic ectoplasm
that bound
a group of people
as one.
Ultimately,
the entire field
collapsed
under its own
imprecision
and incoherence.
The notion
of a group mind
slipped ignominiously
into the history
of social psychology,
writes one observer.
It was
banished
from the realm
of respectable
scientific discourse,
notes another.
Social scientists
took as their
near-exclusive focus
the individual,
thinking and acting
on his own.
But the serious
study of the group mind
is now staging
a surprising
comeback.
It owes its resurgence
to sheer necessity
contemporary conditions
demand it.
Knowledge is more
abundant,
expertise is more
specialized,
problems are more
complex.
The activation
of the group mind
in which factual
knowledge,
skilled expertise,
and mental effort
are distributed
across multiple
individuals
is the only
adequate response
to these developments.
As group thinking
has become
more imperative,
interest has grown
in learning
how to do it well.
At the same time,
reimagined theories
and novel
investigative methods
have granted
researchers new
insight into how
the group mind
actually operates,
placing the field
on a genuinely
scientific footing.
Neither senseless
nor supernatural,
group thinking
is a sophisticated
human ability
based on a few
fundamental mechanisms.
We'll begin
with this one,
synchrony.
Every morning
at 6.30,
the program
starts up
with the jaunty
plinking
of a piano.
Nobi nobi
to senobi
no ando kara
announces the narrator
of Radio Chaiso,
a three-minute
calisthenics routine
broadcast daily
in Japan
for decades.
Stand tall
and stretch
your whole body.
On cue,
millions of Japanese
gathered in
office buildings,
factories,
construction sites,
community centers,
and public parks
begin working
through a series
of exercises
they've known
by heart
since childhood.
Ichi ni u shiro
ni sorasete
sugi wa ude
to ashi no ando
one, two,
and back down,
stretch your back,
next, arms and legs.
Classmates,
co-workers,
groups of young mothers,
and senior citizens
reach, flex,
twist, and hop
in unison.
Now, forward bends
with rhythmic bounces.
Bend three times,
then hands on your hips,
bend backwards.
Arms swinging,
knees dipping,
they move
as if one body,
right up to the program's
closing lines.
Fukaku,
i ki o sui masu,
yukuri sutei,
yukuri haiitei,
go ruku mo ikai.
And we end with deep breaths,
slowly in and slowly out,
five, six,
and one more time.
The benefits of this activity,
practiced by everyone
from the youngest school children
to top executives
at Sony and Toyota,
may go well beyond fitness
and flexibility
for those who take part.
A substantial body
of research
shows that
behavioral synchrony,
coordinating our actions,
including our physical movements,
so that they are like
the actions of others,
primes us for what we might call
cognitive synchrony,
multiple people
thinking together
efficiently and effectively.
A study by psychologists
at the University of Washington,
for example,
asked pairs of four-year-old children
to play on a swing set apparatus
installed in their lab.
The researchers then
discreetly manipulated
whether the kids swung
in unison or out of sync.
After getting down
from the swings,
the preschoolers
who had swung in time
with their partners
were more likely
to cooperate
with those same partners
on a subsequent set of tasks.
Comparable results
were found
among eight-year-olds
who experienced
synchronized play
on a computer game.
Afterwards,
they reported feeling
a greater sense
of similarity
and closeness
to their partners
than did participants
who also played the game
but did so out of sync
with their peers.
Studies conducted
with adults
show the same.
Moving in sync
makes us better collaborators.
Why would this be?
On the most basic level,
synchrony sends
a tangible signal
to others
that we are open
to cooperation
as well as capable
of cooperation.
Synchronized movement
acts as an invitation
to work together
along with an assurance
that such work
will be productive.
In addition
to this signaling function,
synchrony appears
to initiate
a cascade of changes
in the way
we view ourselves
and others.
The recognition
that we're moving
in the same way
at the same time
as other people
heightens our awareness
of being part
of a group
leading us
to focus less
on ourselves
as individuals.
Because these others
are making motions
similar to our own,
we're able to interpret
and predict
their actions
more easily.
Research shows
that we are more apt
to mentalize about them,
forming a notion
of what's going on
in their heads.
Synchrony even alters
the nature
of our perception,
making our visual system
more sensitive
to the occurrence
of movement.
As a result
of such changes,
we form more accurate
memories of people
we have synchronized with,
including the way
they look,
the moves they make,
and the words they say.
We learn from them
more readily,
we communicate
with them more fluidly,
and we pursue
shared goals
with them
more effectively.
On an emotional level,
synchrony has the effect
of making others,
even strangers,
seem a bit like
friends and family.
We feel more warmly
towards those
with whom we have
experienced synchrony,
we're more willing
to help them out
and to make sacrifices
on their behalf.
We may experience
a blurring
of the boundaries
between ourselves
and others,
but rather than feeling
that our individual selves
have shrunk,
we feel personally
enlarged and empowered,
as if all the resources
of the group
are now at our disposal.
Studies of athletes
and dancers
have even found
that moving in unison,
increases endurance
and reduces the perception
of physical pain.
Synchronization
sweeps us up
into what one researcher
calls a social eddy,
in which the press
of our individual interest
is diminished
and the performance
of the group
becomes paramount.
When we are carried along
by the social eddy,
cooperation with others
feels smooth,
almost effortless.
The popularity
of synchronized exercises
in Japan,
a society famous
for its communal spirit
and internal cohesion,
would appear
to be firmly grounded
in research
and in the workings
of human nature.
In every culture
and every era,
armies, churches,
and other institutions
have used
synchronous movement
to bond
disparate individuals
into a unified whole.
Picture a group
of American citizens
placing their right hands
over their hearts
and reciting
the Pledge of Allegiance,
for example,
or a Catholic congregation
kneeling and bowing
their heads,
speaking aloud
the same words
at the same time
from the missile.
Synchrony is a highly effective
biotechnology
of group formation,
as neuroscientist
Walter Freeman put it.
But why would such
a technology
be necessary?
Because,
says Jonathan Haidt,
human nature
is 90% chimp
and 10% bee.
Haidt,
a psychologist
at NYU's
Stern School of Business,
notes that,
in the main,
we are competitive,
self-interested animals
intent on pursuing
our own ends.
That's the chimp part.
But we can also
be like bees,
ultra-social creatures
who are able
to think and act
as one
for the good
of the group.
Haidt argues
for the existence
in humans
of a psychological trigger
he calls
the hive switch.
When the hive switch
is flipped,
our minds shift
from an individual
focus to a group
focus,
from I-mode
to we-mode.
Getting this switch
to turn on
is the key
to thinking together
to get things done,
to extending
our individual minds
with the groups
to which we belong.
Synchronous movement
is one way
of flipping this switch.
It reliably produces
what the late historian
William McNeil
called
muscular bonding.
He maintained
that the long-standing
dominance
of European armies
over other
fighting forces
was due in part
to the psychological
effect of
close-order drill,
a practice
that took root
in the Netherlands
in the 16th century
before spreading
to other European nations.
Soldiers spent
hours marching
in formation,
their movements
tightly coordinated,
thereby creating
a mental
and emotional bond
that elevated
their performance
on the battlefield.
McNeil,
a distinguished
military scholar,
wrote about
the transformative
effect of
martial drills
not only from
his erudition,
but from his
personal experience
as well.
As a young man,
he was drafted
into the U.S. Army
and sent to basic
training in Texas.
There,
he and his fellow
recruits were ordered
to march,
hour after hour,
moving in unison
and by the numbers
in response
to shouted commands,
sweating in the hot sun,
and every so often
counting out the cadence
as we marched.
Hut,
hup,
hip,
four,
McNeil recounted.
A more useless
exercise would be
hard to imagine,
he notes,
wryly.
And yet,
as the hours wore on,
he found himself
entering a state
of generalized
emotional exaltation.
Words are inadequate
to describe the emotion
aroused by the
prolonged movement
in unison
that drilling involved,
he wrote.
A sense of
pervasive well-being
is what I recall.
More specifically,
a strange sense
of personal enlargement,
a sort of swelling out,
becoming bigger than life,
thanks to participation
in collective ritual.
McNeil continued,
obviously something visceral
was at work,
something I later concluded
far older than language
and critically important
in human history,
because the emotion
it arouses
constitutes
an indefinitely
expansible basis
for social cohesion
among any
and every group
that keeps together
in time,
moving big muscles
together
and chanting,
singing,
or shouting
rhythmically.
What happened
to McNeil
and his comrades
on that dusty,
graveled patch
of the Texas plain
was surely
the product
of behavioral synchrony,
of moving together
in a coordinated manner.
But there was likely
another factor
affecting them as well.
Not just shared movement,
but shared arousal.
Their bodies'
common response
to the physical exertion
of marching,
the heat of the sun,
the shouted commands
of their superiors,
this too supported
the emergence
of a group mind.
The significance
of shared arousal
was demonstrated
in an ingenious experiment
designed by researcher
Joshua Conrad Jackson
and published
in the journal
Scientific Reports
in 2018.
Jackson and his colleagues
set out to
simulate conditions
found in actual
marching rituals,
which, they noted,
requires the use
of a larger venue
than a traditional
psychology laboratory.
They chose as the setting
for their study
a professional sports stadium
with a high-definition camera
mounted 25 meters
above the action.
After gathering
172 participants
in the stadium
and dividing them
into groups,
the experimenters
manipulated their experience
of both synchrony
and arousal.
One group was directed
to walk
with their fellow members
in rank formation,
while a second group
walked in a loose
and uncoordinated fashion.
A third group
speed-walked
around the stadium,
boosting their
physiological arousal,
while a fourth group
strolled
at a leisurely pace.
Jackson and his collaborators
then had each group
engage in the same
set of activities,
asking them
to gather themselves
into cliques,
to disperse themselves
as they wished
across the stadium's
playing field,
and finally,
to cooperate
in a joint task,
collecting 500 metal washers
scattered across the field.
The result,
when participating
in a joint
