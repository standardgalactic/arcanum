So whether you're learning for personal growth, travel, business, or school, or to understand culture or pop culture like movies, TV shows, or music, this course will help you meet your language learning goals fast.
Follow the five simple steps outlined in our program and start speaking from the very first lesson.
You'll learn proper pronunciation, cultural insight, and insider information that will utterly shock and amaze your friends, family, co-workers, and teachers.
How to use the program. This program focuses on building core skills necessary to learn a language fast.
Each part of the program focuses on a particular skill, and the course was carefully designed so each lesson builds upon the previous one.
We recommend 45 minutes to listen, study, and review each lesson, but you can master a lesson in as little as 8 to 15 minutes.
A lesson consists of a lesson audio track, which is 8 to 15 minutes, a conversation-only audio track, which is under a minute, a key vocabulary review audio track, which is approximately 3 minutes, and the lesson notes, which take approximately 25 minutes to review.
To get the maximum benefit from our system, follow the following five simple steps.
These steps reduce complexity and accelerate learning. Lessons stay fun and interesting, and you'll reach your language learning goals in the fastest time possible.
Step 1. Listen to the lesson audio track one time all the way through.
Each audio track is about 8 to 15 minutes, and each component of the lesson is designed to improve a specific language learning skill or teach you some new information.
The lesson format was developed by professional teachers using feedback from the language learning community.
The flow of the lesson track is as follows.
First, the host will provide context for a practical, real-world conversation in the language you're studying.
Next, you'll hear the conversation, recorded by professional voice actors, three times in a series.
First, you'll hear it at natural native speed, then at a slower speed with intonation clearly pronounced, and finally with an English translation.
It's natural at this point that you won't understand every little nuance of the conversation.
Don't be alarmed or anxious, but continue to listen to the program.
Listening to the dialogues first is a key part of our system of accelerated learning.
The hosts will then take you inside the conversation and give you insight into the larger cultural issues that frame it.
Next, you'll hear the key vocabulary. Each word or phrase is presented once at natural native speed.
Then, you'll hear the English translation.
After this, you'll hear it broken down in the native language, syllable by syllable, and repeated once more at natural native speed.
The syllable by syllable breakdown of key words is critical to mastering pronunciation and adjusting your ear to the sound of the language.
Next, you'll learn more about usage of key words and phrases as they are illustrated by examples.
Finally, master the grammar used in the conversation with a detailed grammar explanation by the hosts.
Step 2. Listen to the conversation-only audio track, which is less than a minute.
You'll understand the conversation much better this time.
And, by adding this short audio track onto your portable media player or onto your computer's audio playlist,
you can quickly and easily review the whole lesson anywhere and at any time.
Step 3. Practice with the audio review track, which is approximately 3 minutes.
When you listen to this track, you will hear a series of key words and core phrases that reinforce fluency and pronunciation.
Listen to the word or phrase.
A pause will follow and give you time to say the word or phrase aloud.
Do so at this time.
It is very important to your progress that you say the words out loud.
Next, you'll then hear the English translation.
At the midway point of the track, the order will be reversed.
You'll hear the English translation first.
Your job is to say the equivalent word or phrase out loud in the pause that follows.
You'll then hear the word or phrase in the target language.
This review track allows you to both practice and evaluate yourself.
Step 4. Read the lesson notes, which takes approximately 25 minutes.
Reading the transcript, translation, vocabulary, and grammar point will reinforce everything you've heard so far.
You'll rapidly improve your reading ability and familiarize yourself with the writing system of the language.
This exercise is designed to improve a different set of skills.
Step 5. Read through the lesson notes while listening to the main audio track one more time, which takes approximately 8 to 15 minutes.
Commit new information to memory and reinforce everything you've learned by following along with the lesson notes.
Read the conversation transcript and study vocabulary and phrases while listening to the audio.
See a detailed explanation and examples of the grammar point as you read along.
Commit it to memory by reviewing all information you learned in the lesson.
Many new learners make the mistake of feeling they must reach 100% comprehension and mastery to move on to the next lesson in the series.
Feedback from hundreds of thousands of listeners has taught us that seeking perfection actually slows down learning and makes it tedious and less effective.
We designed our system from the bottom up to be self-reinforcing.
Once you reach about 80% comprehension of the dialogue in a lesson, you should feel free to move on to the next lesson in the series.
It's important to listen to the lessons in order.
And, since this course is one level in a larger system, once this level is complete, move on to the next.
You'll master new language skills and also reinforce the lessons from this level.
Experience has taught us that this is the fastest and most enjoyable path to second language mastery.
Course content.

And the results?
Shockingly good, in the words of a user.
Program users are shocked at their rapid progress and native speakers are shocked at their language ability.
Many of our language learners have told us that native speakers are truly shocked at some of the practical, everyday words and phrases they use.
The native speakers repeatedly ask where they learned such good language skills.
Follow our 5 simple steps and you too will see shocking results fast.

Lesson 1
How are you?
In this lesson, you will learn how to...
Greet people.
And this conversation takes place...
On the streets of Egypt.
And this conversation is between...
Hala and Roland.
The speakers are friends.
Therefore, the speakers will be speaking...
Informal Egyptian Arabic.
Zabt.
Okay, let's listen to this conversation.
Hello everyone, Hala. How are you?
Hello everyone, Roland.
I'm good. Thank you.
And you? How are you?
Thank you.
Thank you.
Are you happy in Egypt?
Yes, I'm happy.
Egypt is beautiful.
Okay.
Will I see you tomorrow at the gym?
No.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Peace.
Peace.
Peace.
Peace be upon you, Hala. How are you?
Peace be upon you, Hala. How are you?
Peace be upon you, Roland. I'm good, thanks. And how are you?
Peace be upon you, Hala. How are you?
Peace be upon you, Hala. How are you?
Peace be upon you, Hala.
Peace be upon you, Hala. I'm good, thanks. And how are you?
I'm good, thanks. And how are you?
Alhamdulillah, تمام.
Thanks be to God. I'm fine.
Are you happy in Egypt?
Yes, I'm happy. Egypt is very beautiful.
Very well. See you tomorrow at university?
Okay, see you tomorrow. Goodbye.
Let's take a look at the vocabulary for this lesson.
Peace be upon you, and peace be with you too.
How are you?
How are you?
Addressing a girl.
Thanks be to God.
Good.
Good, but also for a girl.
Means well or good.
See you for a man.
Lesson focus.
The focus of this lesson is simple sentences in Egyptian Arabic.
In Arabic, there is no equivalent of the verb to be in present tense.
We can't find an equivalent or the verb itself in past or future tenses
when speaking about habits and routine or about future plans.
That's right. This might be confusing at start,
but I promise it's really easy to get used to.
When addressing a man or a woman,
you use different forms of greetings.
In the dialogue, Roland said,
Izzayyak.
While Hala said,
Izzayyak.
So the sound ak is used for a man,
while the sound ik is used for a woman.
It's not bi.
It doesn't depend on the gender of the speaker,
but the one you're addressing.
So because I was speaking to Roland,
I said,
Izzayyak.
And he's speaking to me as a girl.
He said,
Izzayyak.
Let's just look at the subject pronouns.
I,
you,
both masculine and feminine forms,
and the adjectives.
So if I want to say I or I am,
I say Anna.
If I want to say you or you are for a man,
I say Enta.
And if I want to say you or you are for a woman,
I say Enti.
We use two forms for you,
masculine and feminine.
This will affect everything that follows it.
So always remember and pay attention to this very small detail.
Which means that when we use the adjectives,
we will have to have it in both masculine and feminine,
and then the plural,
but we'll wait until the time comes for that.
Listen to the entire conversation once again.
