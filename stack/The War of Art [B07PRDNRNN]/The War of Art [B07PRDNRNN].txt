The War of Art, written by Stephen Pressfield and read by Stephen Pressfield.
We come into this world with a specific personal destiny.
We have a job to do, a calling to enact, a self to become.
We are who we are from the cradle and we're stuck with it.
Our job in this lifetime is not to shape ourselves into some ideal we imagine we ought to be,
but to find out who we are already and become it.
If we were born to paint, it's our job to become a painter.
If we were born to raise and nurture children, it's our job to become a mother.
If we were born to overthrow the order of ignorance and injustice in the world,
it's our job to realize it and get down to business.
We know that if we embrace our ideals, we must prove worthy of them,
and that scares the hell out of us.
What will become of us?
We will lose our friends and family who will no longer recognize us.
We will wind up alone in the cold, void of starry space with nothing and no one to hold on to.
Of course, this is exactly what happens.
But here's the trick.
We wind up in space, but not alone.
Instead, we are tapped into an unquenchable, undepletable, inexhaustible source of wisdom, consciousness, companionship.
Yeah, we lose friends, but we find friends, too, in places we never thought to look.
And they're better friends, truer friends, and we're better and truer to them.
The unlived life.
Most of us have two lives, the life we live and the unlived life within us.
Between the two stands resistance.
Have you ever brought home a treadmill and let it gather dust in the attic?
Ever quit a diet, a course of yoga, a meditation practice?
Have you ever bailed out on a call to embark upon a spiritual practice,
dedicate yourself to a humanitarian calling, commit your life to the service of others?
Have you ever wanted to be a mother, a doctor, an advocate for the weak and helpless,
to run for office, crusade for the planet, campaign for world peace, or to preserve the environment?
Late at night, have you experienced a vision of the person you might become,
the work you could accomplish, the realized being you were meant to be?
Are you a writer who doesn't write, a painter who doesn't paint,
an entrepreneur who never starts adventure?
Then you know what resistance is.
This is from John Lee Hooker's song, Boogie Chillin'.
One night I was laying down, I heard Papa talking to Mama.
I heard Papa say to let that boy boogie woogie,
because it's in him and it's got to come out.
Resistance is the most toxic force on the planet.
It is the root of more unhappiness than poverty, disease, and erectile dysfunction.
To yield to resistance deforms our spirit.
It stunts us and makes us less than what we are and were born to be.
If you believe in God, and I do, you must declare resistance evil,
for it prevents us from achieving the life God intended
when he endowed each of us with our own unique genius.
Genius is a Latin word.
The Romans used it to denote an inner spirit, holy and inviolable,
which watches over us, guiding us to our calling.
A writer writes with his genius, an artist paints with hers.
Everyone who creates operates from this sacramental center.
It is our soul's seat, the vessel that holds our being and potential,
our star's beacon and polaris.
Every sun casts a shadow, and genius's shadow is resistance.
Resistance, as powerful as is our soul's call to realization,
so potent are the forces of resistance arrayed against us.
Resistance is faster than a speeding bullet,
more powerful than a locomotive, harder to kick than crack cocaine.
We're not alone if we've been mowed down by resistance.
Millions of good men and women have bitten the dust before us.
And here's the biggest bitch.
We don't even know what hit us.
I never did.
From age 24 to 32, resistance kicked my ass from east coast to west and back again 13 times,
and I never even knew it existed.
I looked everywhere for the enemy and failed to see it right in front of my face.
Have you heard this story?
Woman learns she has cancer, six months to live.
Within days, she quits her job,
resumes the dream of writing Tex-Mex songs she gave up to raise a family,
or starts studying classical Greek or moves to the inner city
and devotes herself to tending babies with AIDS.
Women's friends think she's crazy.
She herself has never been happier.
There's a postscript.
Woman's cancer goes into remission.
Is that what it takes?
Do we have to stare death in the face to make us stand up and confront resistance?
Does resistance have to cripple and disfigure our lives before we wake up to its existence?
How many of us have become drunks and drug addicts,
develop tumors and neuroses,
succumb to painkillers, gossip, and compulsive cell phone use
simply because we don't do that thing that our hearts,
our inner genius, is calling us to?
Resistance defeats us.
If tomorrow morning, by some stroke of magic,
every dazed and benighted soul woke up with the power
to take the first step towards pursuing his or her dreams,
every shrink in the directory would be out of business.
Prisons would stand empty.
The alcohol and tobacco industries would collapse,
along with the junk food, cosmetic surgery, and infotainment businesses,
not to mention pharmaceutical companies, hospitals,
and the medical profession from top to bottom.
Domestic abuse would become extinct,
as would addiction, obesity, migraine, headaches, road rage, and dandruff.
Look in your own heart.
Unless I'm crazy, right now a still small voice is piping up,
telling you as it has 10,000 times the calling
that is yours and yours alone.
You know it.
No one has to tell you.
And unless I'm crazy, you're no closer to taking action on it
than you were yesterday or will be tomorrow.
You think resistance isn't real?
Resistance will bury you.
You know, Hitler wanted to be an artist.
At 18, he took his inheritance, 700 kronen,
and moved to Vienna to live and study.
He applied to the Academy of Fine Arts and later to the School of Architecture.
Ever see one of his paintings?
Neither have I.
Resistance beat him.
Call it overstatement, but I'll say it anyway.
It was easier for Hitler to start World War II
than it was for him to face a blank square of canvas.
What I Know
There's a secret that real writers
or anyone in any creative endeavor knows
that wannabe writers don't.
And the secret is this.
It's not the writing part that's hard.
What's hard is sitting down to write.
What keeps us from sitting down is resistance.
Part One
Resistance Defining the Enemy
The enemy is a very good teacher, a Dalai Lama.
Let me start with Resistance's Greatest Hits.
The following is a list in no particular order
of those activities that most commonly elicit resistance.
One, the pursuit of any calling in writing, painting, music, film, dance,
or any creative art, however marginal or unconventional.
Two, the launching of any entrepreneurial venture or enterprise,
for profit or otherwise.
Three, any diet or health regimen.
Four, any program of spiritual advancement.
Five, any activity whose aim is tighter abdominals.
Six, any course or program designed to overcome
an unwholesome habit or addiction.
Seven, education of every kind.
Eight, any act of political, moral, or ethical courage,
including the decision to change for the better
some unworthy pattern of thought or conduct in ourselves.
Nine, the undertaking of any enterprise or endeavor
whose aim is to help others.
Ten, any act that entails commitment of the heart.
The decision to get married, to have a child,
to weather a rocky patch in a relationship.
And eleven, the taking of any principled stand
in the face of adversity.
In other words, any act that rejects immediate gratification
in favor of long-term growth, health, or integrity,
or expressed another way,
any act that derives from our higher nature
instead of our lower.
Any of these will elicit resistance.
Now, what are the characteristics of resistance?
First off, resistance is invisible.
Resistance cannot be seen, touched, heard, or smelled,
but it can be felt.
We experience it as an energy field
radiating from a work in potential.
It's a repelling force.
It's negative.
Its aim is to shove us away, distract us,
prevent us from doing our work.
Resistance is internal.
Resistance seems to come from outside ourselves.
We locate it in spouses, jobs, bosses, kids,
peripheral opponents, as Pat Riley used to say
when he coached the Los Angeles Lakers.
Resistance is not a peripheral opponent.
Resistance arises from within.
It is self-generated and self-perpetuated.
Resistance is the enemy within.
Resistance is insidious.
Resistance will tell you anything
to keep you from doing your work.
It will perjure, fabricate, falsify,
seduce, bully, cajole.
Resistance is protean.
It will assume any form
if that's what it takes to deceive you.
It will reason with you like a lawyer
or jam a nine millimeter in your face
like a stick-up man.
Resistance has no conscience.
It will pledge anything to get a deal,
then double-cross you
as soon as your back is turned.
If you take resistance at its word,
you deserve everything you get.
Resistance is always lying
and always full of crap.
Resistance is implacable.
Resistance is like the alien
or the Terminator
or the shark in Jaws.
It cannot be reasoned with.
It understands nothing but power.
It is an engine of destruction
programmed from the factory
with one object only
to prevent us from doing our work.
Resistance is implacable,
intractable, indefatigable.
Reduce it to a single cell
and that cell will continue to attack.
This is resistance's nature.
It's all it knows.
Let's continue our look
at characteristics of resistance
with resistance is impersonal.
Resistance is not out
to get you personally.
It doesn't know who you are
and doesn't care.
Resistance is a force of nature.
It acts objectively.
Though it feels malevolent,
resistance in fact
operates with the indifference of rain
and transits the heavens
by the same laws as the stars.
When we marshal our forces
to combat resistance,
we must remember this.
Resistance is infallible.
Like a magnetized needle
floating on a surface of oil,
resistance will unfailingly
point to true north,
meaning that calling or action
it most wants to stop us from doing.
We can use this.
We can use it as a compass.
We can navigate by resistance,
letting it guide us
to that calling or action
that we must follow
before all others.
Rule of thumb,
the more important
a call or action is
to our soul's evolution,
the more resistance
we will feel
toward pursuing it.
Resistance is universal.
We're wrong if we think
we're the only ones
struggling with resistance.
Everyone who has a body
experiences resistance.
resistance never sleeps.
Henry Fonda was still
throwing up before
each stage performance
even when he was 75.
In other words,
fear doesn't go away.
The warrior and the artist
live by the same code
of necessity,
which dictates that the battle
must be fought anew
every day.
The next thing I'd like
to talk about is
resistance plays for keeps.
Resistance's goal
is not to wound or disable.
Resistance aims to kill.
Its target is the epicenter
of our being,
our genius,
our soul,
the unique and priceless gift
we were put on earth
to give,
and that no one else
has but us.
Resistance means business.
When we fight it,
we are in a war
to the death.
Resistance is fueled by fear.
Resistance has no strength
of its own.
Every ounce of juice
it possesses comes from us.
We feed it with power
by our fear of it.
Master that fear
and we conquer resistance.
Next,
resistance only opposes
in one direction.
Resistance obstructs movement
only from a lower sphere
to a higher.
It kicks in
when we seek to pursue
a calling in the arts,
launch an innovative enterprise,
or evolve to a higher station
morally,
ethically,
or spiritually.
So if you're in Calcutta
working with
the Mother Teresa Foundation
and you're thinking of bolting
to launch a career
in telemarketing,
relax.
Resistance will give you
a free pass.
Next,
resistance is most powerful
at the finish line.
Odysseus almost got home
years before
his actual homecoming.
Ithaca was in sight,
close enough
that the sailors
could see the smoke
of their family's fires
on shore.
Odysseus was so certain
he was safe
he actually lay down
for a snooze.
It was then
that his men,
believing there was gold
in an oxide sack
among their commander's possessions,
snatched this prize
and cut it open.
The bag contained
the adverse winds
which King Aeolus
had bottled up
for Odysseus
when the wanderer
had touched earlier
at his blessed isle.
The winds burst forth
now in one mad blow,
driving Odysseus' ships
back across
every league of ocean
they had with such difficulty
traversed,
making him endure
further trials
and sufferings
before at last
and alone
he reached home
for good.
The danger is greatest
when the finish line
is in sight.
At this point,
resistance knows
we're about to beat it.
It hits the panic button.
It marshals
one last assault
and slams us
with everything it's got.
The professional
must be alert
for this counterattack.
Be wary at the end.
Don't open
that bag of wind.
And the final characteristic
is resistance
recruits allies.
Resistance by definition
is self-sabotage,
but there's a parallel peril
that must also
be guarded against,
sabotaged by others.
When a writer
or any budding
entrepreneur
or artist
begins to overcome
her resistance,
in other words,
when she actually
starts to write,
she may find
that those close to her
begin acting strange.
They may become
moody or sullen.
They may get sick.
They may accuse
the awakening writer
of changing,
of not being
the person she was.
The closer these people
are to the awakening writer,
the more bizarrely
they will act
and the more emotion
they will put
behind their actions.
They are trying
to sabotage her.
The reason is
that they are struggling
consciously or unconsciously
against their own resistance.
The awakening writer's
success becomes
a reproach to them.
If she can beat
these demons,
why can't they?
Often couples
or close friends,
even entire families,
will enter into
tacit compacts
whereby each individual
pledges,
unconsciously,
to remain mired
in the same slough
in which she
and all her cronies
have become so comfortable.
The highest treason
a crab can commit
is to leap
for the rim of the bucket.
The awakening artist
must be ruthless,
not only with herself,
but with others.
Once you make your break,
you can't turn around
for your buddy
who catches his trouser leg
on the barbed wire.
The best thing
you can do
for that friend,
and he'd tell you
this himself
if he's really your friend,
is to get over the wall
and keep motating.
The best and only thing
that one artist
can do for another
is to serve
as an example
and an inspiration.
Now, let's consider
the next aspect
of resistance,
symptoms.
The first is
resistance and procrastination.
Procrastination is
the most common
manifestation of resistance
because it's the easiest
to rationalize.
We don't tell ourselves,
I'm never going to
write my symphony.
Instead, we say,
I am going to write
my symphony.
I'm just going to
start tomorrow.
Then there's resistance
and procrastination,
part two.
The most pernicious
aspect of procrastination
is that it can become
a habit.
We don't just put off
our lives today.
We put them off
till our deathbed.
Never forget,
this very moment
we can change our lives.
There never was a moment
and never will be
when we are without
the power to alter
our destiny.
This second,
we can turn the tables
on resistance.
This second,
we can sit down
and do our work.
Resistance and sex.
Sometimes resistance
takes the form of sex
or an obsessive
preoccupation with sex.
Why sex?
Because sex provides
immediate and powerful
gratification.
When someone sleeps with us,
we feel validated
and approved of,
even loved.
Resistance gets a big
kick out of that.
It knows it has
distracted us
with a cheap,
easy fix
and kept us
from doing our work.
Of course,
not all sex
is a manifestation
of resistance.
In my experience,
you can tell
by the measure
of hollowness
you feel afterwards.
The more empty
you feel,
the more certain
you can be
that your true motivation
was not love
or even lust,
but resistance.
It goes without saying
that this principle
applies to drugs,
shopping,
masturbation,
TV,
gossip,
alcohol
and the consumption
of all products
containing fat,
sugar,
salt or chocolate.
Resistance and trouble.
We get ourselves
in trouble
because it's a cheap way
to get attention.
Trouble is a faux form
of fame.
It's easier to get busted
in the bedroom
with the faculty chairman's wife
than it is to finish
that dissertation
on the metaphysics
of Motley
in the novellas
of Joseph Conrad.
Ill health
is a form of trouble
as are alcoholism
and drug addiction,
proneness to accidents,
all neurosis
including compulsive
screwing up,
and such seemingly
benign foibles
as jealousy,
chronic lateness,
and the blasting
of rap music
at 110 dB
from your smoked glass
95 Supra.
Anything that draws
attention to ourselves
through pain-free
or artificial means
is a manifestation
of resistance.
Cruelty to others
is a form of resistance
as is the willing endurance
of cruelty from others.
The working artist
will not tolerate
trouble in her life
because she knows
trouble prevents her
from doing her work.
The working artist
banishes from her world
all sources of trouble.
She harnesses the urge
for trouble
and transforms it
in her work.
Here's another symptom.
Resistance and self-dramatization.
Creating soap opera
in our lives
is a symptom of resistance.
Why put in years of work
designing a new
software interface
when you can get
just as much attention
by bringing home
a boyfriend
with a prison record?
Sometimes entire families
participate unconsciously
in a culture
of self-dramatization.
The kids fuel the tanks,
the grown-ups arm
the phasers,
the whole starship
lurches from one
spine-tingling episode
to another,
and the crew knows
how to keep it going.
If the level of drama
drops below a certain threshold,
someone jumps in
to amp it up.
Dad gets drunk,
Mom gets sick,
Janie shows up for church
with an Oakland Raiders tattoo.
It's more fun
than a movie,
and it works.
Nobody gets
a damn thing done.
Sometimes I think
of Resistance
as a sort of
evil twin to Santa Claus
who makes his rounds
house to house,
making sure that
everything's taken care of.
When he comes to a house
that's hooked
on self-dramatization,
his ruddy cheeks glow
and he giddy-ups away
behind his
eight tiny reindeer.
He knows there'll be
no work done
in that house.
Next,
Resistance
and Self-Medication.
Do you regularly
ingest any substance,
controlled or otherwise,
whose aim is the
alleviation of depression,
anxiety, etc.?
I offer the following experience.
I once worked as a writer
for a big New York
ad agency.
Our boss used to tell us,
invent a disease.
Come up with a disease,
he said,
and we can sell the cure.
Attention deficit disorder,
seasonal affect disorder,
social anxiety disorder,
these aren't diseases,
they're marketing ploys.
Doctors didn't discover them,
copywriters did,
marketing departments did,
drug companies did.
Depression and anxiety
may be real,
but they can also be resistance.
When we drug ourselves
to blot out our soul's call,
we are being good Americans
and exemplary consumers.
We're doing exactly
what TV commercials
and pop materialist culture
have been brainwashing us
to do from birth.
Instead of applying
self-knowledge,
self-discipline,
delayed gratification
and hard work,
we simply consume a product.
Many pedestrians
have been maimed or killed
at the intersection
of resistance and commerce.
Resistance and victimhood.
Doctors estimate
that 70 to 80 percent
of their business
is non-health related.
People aren't sick,
they're self-dramatizing.
Sometimes the hardest part
of a medical job
is keeping a straight face.
As Jerry Seinfeld observed
of his 20 years of dating,
quote,
that's a lot of acting fascinated.
The acquisition of a condition
lends significance
to one's existence.
An illness across to bear.
Some people go from
condition to condition.
They cure one
and another pops up
to take its place.
The condition becomes
a work of art in itself,
a shadow version
of the real creative act
the victim is avoiding
by expending so much care
cultivating his condition.
A victim act is a form
of passive aggression.
It seeks to achieve gratification
not by honest work
or contribution
made out of one's experience
or insight or love,
but by the manipulation
of others
through silent
and not-so-silent threat.
The victim compels others
to come to his rescue
or to behave as he wishes
by holding them hostage
to the prospect
of his own further illness,
meltdown,
mental dissolution,
or simply by threatening
to make their lives
so miserable
that they do what he wants.
Casting yourself as a victim
is the antithesis
of doing your work.
Don't do it.
If you're doing it, stop.
Resistance and the Choice of a Mate
Sometimes, if we're not conscious
of our own resistance,
we'll pick as a mate
someone who has or is
successfully overcoming resistance.
I'm not sure why.
Maybe it's easier to endow
our partner with the power
that we, in fact, possess
but are afraid to act upon.
Maybe it's less threatening
to believe that our beloved spouse
is worthy to live out
his or her unlived life
while we are not.
Or maybe we're hoping
to use our mate as a model.
Maybe we believe
or wish we could
that some of our spouse's power
will rub off on us
if we just hang around it long enough.
This is how resistance
disfigures love.
The stew it creates is rich,
it's colorful,
Tennessee Williams
could work it up
into a trilogy.
But is it love?
If we're the supporting partner,
shouldn't we face
our own failure
to pursue our unlived life
rather than hitchhike
on our spouse's coattails?
And if we're the support
and partner,
shouldn't we step out
from the glow
of our loved one's adoration
and instead encourage him
to let his own light shine?
Resistance and this book.
When I began this book,
resistance almost beat me.
This is the form it took.
It told me,
the voice in my head, that is,
that I was a writer of fiction,
not non-fiction,
and that I shouldn't be exposing
these concepts of resistance
literally and overtly.
Rather, I should incorporate
them metaphorically into a novel.
That's a pretty damn subtle
and convincing argument.
The rationalization
that resistance presented me with
was that I should write, say,
a war piece in which
the principles of resistance
were expressed as the fear
a warrior feels.
Resistance also told me
I shouldn't seek to instruct
or put myself forward
as a purveyor of wisdom,
that this was vain,
egotistical,
possibly even corrupt,
and that it would work harm
to me in the end.
That scared me.
It made a lot of sense.
What finally convinced me
to go ahead was simply
that I was so unhappy
not going ahead.
I was developing symptoms.
As soon as I sat down
and began,
I was okay.
Resistance and unhappiness.
What does resistance feel like?
First, unhappiness.
We feel like hell.
A low-grade misery
pervades everything.
We're bored.
We're restless.
We can't get no satisfaction.
There's guilt,
but we can't put our finger
on the source.
We want to go back to bed.
We want to get up and party.
We feel unloved and unlovable.
We're disgusted.
We hate our lives.
We hate ourselves.
Unalleviated,
resistance mounts to a pitch
that becomes unendurable.
At this point,
vices kick in.
Dope,
adultery,
web surfing.
Beyond that,
resistance becomes clinical.
Depression,
aggression,
dysfunction,
then actual crime
and physical self-destruction.
Sounds like life,
I know.
It isn't.
It's resistance.
What makes it tricky
is that we live
in a consumer culture
that's acutely aware
of this unhappiness
and has massed
all its profit-seeking artillery
to exploit it
by selling us a product,
a drug,
a distraction.
As John Lennon once wrote,
Well,
you think you're so clever
and classless and free,
but you're all bleeping peasants
as far as I can see.
As artists and professionals,
it is our obligation
to enact
our own internal revolution,
a private insurrection
inside our own skulls.
In this uprising,
we free ourselves
from the tyranny
of consumer culture.
We overthrow the programming
of advertising,
movies,
video games,
magazines,
TV,
and MTV
by which we have been
hypnotized from the cradle.
We unplug ourselves
from the grid
by recognizing
that we will never
cure our restlessness
by contributing
our disposable income
to the bottom line
of BS Incorporated,
but only by doing our work.
Resistance and Fundamentalism
The artist and the fundamentalist
both confront the same issue,
the mystery of their existence
as individuals.
Each asks the same questions.
Who am I?
Why am I here?
What is the meaning of my life?
At more primitive stages
of evolution,
humanity didn't have to deal
with such questions.
In the stages of savagery,
of barbarism,
in nomadic culture,
medieval society,
in the tribe and the clan,
one's position was fixed
by the commandments
of the community.
It was only with the advent
of modernity,
starting with the ancient Greeks,
with the birth of freedom
and of the individual,
that such matters
ascended to the fore.
These are not easy questions.
Who am I?
Why am I here?
They're not easy
because the human being
isn't wired to function
as an individual.
We're wired tribally
to act as part of a group.
Our psyches are programmed
by millions of years
of hunter-gatherer evolution.
We know what the clan is.
We know how to fit
into the band and the tribe.
What we don't know
is how to be alone.
We don't know
how to be free individuals.
The artist and the fundamentalist
arise from societies
at differing stages
of development.
The artist is the advanced model.
His culture possesses
affluence, stability,
enough excess of resource
to permit the luxury
of self-examination.
The artist is grounded
in freedom.
He is not afraid of it.
He is lucky.
He was born in the right place.
He has a core of self-confidence,
of hope for the future.
He believes in progress
and evolution.
His faith is that
humankind is advancing,
however haltingly
and imperfectly,
toward a better world.
The fundamentalist
entertains no such notion.
In his view,
humanity has fallen
from a higher state.
The truth is not out there
awaiting revelation.
It has already been revealed.
The word of God
has been spoken
and recorded by his prophet,
be he Jesus,
Mohammed,
or Karl Marx.
Fundamentalism
is the philosophy
of the powerless,
the conquered,
the displaced,
and the dispossessed.
Its spawning ground
is the wreckage
of political
and military defeat.
As Hebrew fundamentalism
arose during
the Babylonian captivity,
as white Christian fundamentalism
appeared in the American South
during Reconstruction,
as the notion
of the master race
evolved in Germany
following World War I.
In such desperate times,
the vanquished race
would perish
without a doctrine
that restored hope
and pride.
Islamic fundamentalism
ascends from the same
landscape of despair
and possesses the same
tremendous and potent appeal.
What exactly is this despair?
It's the despair of freedom,
the dislocation
and emasculation
experienced by the individual
cut free from the familiar
and comforting structures
of the tribe
and the clan,
the village,
and the family.
It is the state
of modern life.
The fundamentalist,
or more accurately,
the beleaguered individual
who comes to embrace
fundamentalism,
cannot stand freedom.
He cannot find his way
into the future,
so he retreats
into the past.
He returns
in imagination
to the glory days
of his race
and seeks to reconstitute
both them and himself
in their purer,
more virtuous light.
He gets back to basics,
to fundamentals.
Fundamentalism and art
are mutually exclusive.
There is no such thing
as fundamentalist art.
This does not mean
that the fundamentalist
is not creative.
Rather,
his creativity is inverted.
He creates destruction.
Even the structures
he builds,
his schools and networks
of organizations
are dedicated to annihilation
of his enemies
and of himself.
But the fundamentalist
reserves his greatest creativity
for the fashioning
of Satan,
the image of his foe,
in opposition to which
he defines
and gives meaning
to his own life.
Like the artist,
the fundamentalist
experiences resistance.
He experiences it
as temptation to sin.
Resistance to the fundamentalist
is the call
of the evil one
seeking to seduce him
from his virtue.
The fundamentalist
is consumed with Satan,
whom he loves
as he loves death.
Is it coincidence
that the suicide bombers
of the World Trade Center
frequented strip clubs
during their training,
or that they conceived
of their reward
as a squadron
of virgin brides
and the license
to ravage them
in the flesh pots
of heaven?
The fundamentalist
hates and fears women
because he sees them
as vessels of Satan,
temptresses like Delilah,
who seduced Samson
from his power.
To combat the call of sin,
i.e. resistance,
the fundamentalist
plunges either into action
or into the study
of sacred texts.
He loses himself
in these,
much as the artist does
in the process of creation.
The difference is
that while the one
looks forward,
hoping to create
a better world,
the other looks backward,
seeking to return
to a purer world
from which he
and all have fallen.
The humanist believes
that humankind,
as individuals,
is called upon
to co-create the world
with God.
This is why he values
human life so highly.
In his view,
things do progress.
Life does evolve.
Each individual
has value,
at least potentially,
in advancing this cause.
The fundamentalist
cannot conceive of this.
In his society,
dissent is not just crime,
but apostasy.
It is heresy,
transgression
against God himself.
When fundamentalism wins,
the world enters
a dark age.
Yet still,
I can't condemn
the one who is drawn
to this philosophy.
I consider my own
inner journey,
the advantages I've had
of education,
affluence,
family support,
health,
and the blind
good luck
to be born American.
And still,
I have learned
to exist
as an autonomous
individual,
if indeed I have,
only by a whisker
and at a cost
I would hate
to have to reckon up.
It may be
that the human race
is not ready
for freedom.
The air of liberty
may be too rarefied
for us to breathe.
Certainly,
I wouldn't be recording
this program
on this subject
if living with freedom
were easy.
The paradox
seems to be,
as Socrates
demonstrated long ago,
that the truly
free individual
is free
only to the extent
of his own
self-mastery,
while those
who will not
govern themselves
are condemned
to find masters
to govern over them.
Now let's take a look
at resistance
and criticism.
If you find yourself
criticizing other people,
you're probably doing it
out of resistance.
When we see others
beginning to live
their authentic selves,
it drives us crazy
if we have not
lived out our own.
Individuals
who are realized
in their own lives
almost never
criticize others.
If they speak at all,
it is to offer encouragement.
Watch yourself.
Of all the manifestations
of resistance,
most only harm ourselves.
Criticism and cruelty
harm others as well.
Resistance and self-doubt.
Self-doubt can be an ally.
This is because it serves
as an indicator
of aspiration.
It reflects love,
love of something
we dream of doing,
and desire,
desire to do it.
If you find yourself
asking yourself
and your friends,
am I really a writer?
Am I really an artist?
Am I really a creative person?
Am I really an entrepreneur?
Chances are you are.
The counterfeit innovator
is wildly self-confident.
The real one
is scared to death.
Resistance and fear.
Are you paralyzed with fear?
That's a good sign.
Fear is good.
Like self-doubt,
fear is an indicator.
Fear tells us
what we have to do.
Remember our rule of thumb.
The more scared we are
of a work or calling,
the more sure we can be
that we have to do it.
Resistance is experienced
as fear.
The degree of fear
equates to the strength
of resistance.
Therefore,
the more fear we feel
about a specific enterprise,
the more certain we can be
that that enterprise
is important to us
and to the growth of our soul.
That's why we feel
so much resistance.
If it meant nothing to us,
there'd be no resistance.
Have you ever watched
Inside the Actor's Studio?
The host, James Lipton,
invariably asks his guests,
what factors make you decide
to take a particular role?
The actor always answers,
because I'm afraid of it.
The professional tackles
the project that will
make him stretch.
He takes on the assignment
that will bear him
into uncharted waters,
compel him to explore
unconscious parts of himself.
Is he scared?
Hell yes, he's petrified.
Conversely, the professional
turns down roles
that he's done before.
He's not afraid of them anymore.
Why waste his time?
So, if you're paralyzed
with fear, it's a good sign.
It shows you what you have to do.
Resistance and love
Resistance is directly
proportional to love.
If you're feeling
massive resistance,
the good news is,
it means there's
tremendous love there, too.
If you didn't love the project
that's terrifying you,
you wouldn't feel anything.
The opposite of love
isn't hate,
it's indifference.
The more resistance
you experience,
the more important
your unmanifested art
project enterprise
is to you,
and the more gratification
you'll feel
when you finally do it.
Next, resistance
and being a star.
Grandiose fantasies
are a symptom of resistance.
They're the sign of an amateur.
The professional has learned
that success, like happiness,
comes as a byproduct of work.
The professional concentrates
on the work
and allows rewards
to come or not come
whatever they like.
Resistance and Isolation
Sometimes we balk
at embarking on an enterprise
because we're afraid
of being alone.
We feel comfortable
with the tribe around us.
It makes us nervous
going off into the woods
on our own.
Here's the trick.
We're never alone.
As soon as we step outside
the campfire glow,
our muse lights on our shoulder
like a butterfly.
The act of courage
calls forth infallibly
that deeper part of ourselves
that supports and sustains us.
Have you ever seen interviews
with the young John Lennon
or Bob Dylan
when the reporter tries to ask
about their personal selves?
The boys deflect these queries
with withering sarcasm.
Why?
Because Lennon and Dylan
know that the part of them
that writes the songs
is not them,
not the personal self
that is of such
surpassing fascination
to their boneheaded interrogators.
Lennon and Dylan
also know
that the part of themselves
that does the writing
is too sacred,
too precious,
too fragile
to be redacted
into soundbites
for the titillation
of would-be idolaters
who are themselves
caught up in their own resistance.
So they put them on
and blow them off.
It is a commonplace
among artists
and children at play
that they're not aware
of time or solitude
while they're chasing
their vision.
The hours fly.
The sculptress
and the tree-climbing tyke
both look up blinking
when mom calls
supper time.
Resistance and Isolation
Part 2
Friends sometimes ask,
don't you get lonely
sitting by yourself
all day?
At first,
it seemed odd
to hear myself answer no.
Then I realized
that I was not alone.
I was in the book.
I was with the characters.
I was with myself.
Not only do I not feel alone
with my characters,
they are more vivid
and interesting to me
than the people
in my real life.
If you think about it,
the case can't be otherwise.
In order for a book
or any project
or enterprise
to hold our attention
for the length of time
it takes to unfold itself,
it has to plug into
some internal perplexity
or passion
that is of paramount
importance to us.
That problem becomes
the theme of our work,
even if we can't,
at the start,
understand or articulate it.
As the characters arise,
each embodies infallibly
an aspect of that dilemma
that perplexity.
These characters
might not be interesting
to anyone else,
but they're absolutely
fascinating to us.
They are us.
Meaner, smarter,
sexier versions of ourselves.
It's fun to be with them
because they're wrestling
with the same issue
that has its hooks into us.
They're our soulmates,
our lovers,
our best friends,
even the villains,
especially the villains.
Even in a program like this
which has no characters,
I don't feel alone
because I'm imagining
the listener
whom I conjure
as an aspiring artist
or entrepreneur
much like my own younger,
less grizzled self
to whom I hope
to impart a little starch
and inspiration
and to prime a little
with some hard knocks wisdom
and a few tricks of the trade.
Resistance and healing.
Have you ever spent time
in Santa Fe?
There's a subculture
of healing there.
The idea is that there's
something therapeutic
in the atmosphere,
a safe place to go
and get yourself together.
There are other places,
Santa Barbara
and Ojai, California
come to mind,
usually populated
by upper middle class people
with more time and money
than they know what to do with,
in which a culture
of healing also obtains.
The concept
in all these environments
seems to be
that one needs
to complete his healing
before he is ready
to do his work.
This way of thinking,
are you ahead of me,
is a form of resistance.
What are we trying
to heal anyway?
The athlete knows
the day will never come
when he wakes up pain-free.
He has to play hurt.
Remember,
the part of us
that we imagine
needs healing
is not the part
we create from.
That part is far deeper
and stronger.
The part we create from
can't be touched
by anything our parents did
or society did.
That part is unsullied,
uncorrupted,
soundproof,
waterproof,
and bulletproof.
In fact,
the more troubles we've got,
the better and richer
that part becomes.
The part that needs healing
is our personal life.
Personal life
has nothing to do with work.
Besides,
what better way of healing
than to find our center
of self-sovereignty?
Isn't that the whole point
of healing?
I washed up in New York
a couple of decades ago,
making 20 bucks a night
driving a cab
and running away full-time
from doing my work.
One night,
alone in my $110-a-month sublet,
I hit bottom
in terms of having
diverted myself
into so many phony channels
so many times
that I couldn't rationalize it
for one more evening.
I dragged out
my ancient Smith Corona,
dreading the experience
as pointless,
fruitless,
meaningless,
not to say
the most painful exercise
I could think of.
For two hours,
I made myself sit there,
torturing out some trash
that I chucked immediately
into the garbage can.
That was enough.
I put the machine away.
I went back to the kitchen.
In the sink
sat 10 days of dishes.
For some reason,
I had enough excess energy
that I decided
to wash them.
The warm water
felt pretty good.
The soap and sponge
were doing their thing.
A pile of clean plates
began rising
in the drying rack.
To my amazement,
I realized
I was whistling.
It hit me
that I had turned a corner.
I was okay.
I would be okay
from here on.
Do you understand?
I hadn't written
anything good.
It might be years
before I would
if I ever did at all.
That didn't matter.
What counted
was that I had,
after years of running
from it,
actually sat down
and done my work.
Don't get me wrong.
I've got nothing
against true healing.
We all need it.
But it has nothing
to do with doing our work
and it can be
a colossal exercise
in resistance.
Resistance loves healing.
Resistance knows
that the more psychic energy
we expend,
dredging and re-dredging
the tired,
boring injustices
of our personal lives,
the less juice
we have to do our work.
Resistance and support.
Have you ever been
to a workshop?
These boondoggles
are colleges of resistance.
They ought to give out
PhDs in resistance.
What better way
of avoiding work
than going to a workshop?
But what I hate
even worse
is the word support.
Seeking support
from friends and family
is like having your people
gathered around
at your deathbed.
It's nice,
but when the ship sails,
all they can do
is stand on the dock
waving goodbye.
Any support we get
from persons of flesh
and blood
is like monopoly money.
It's not legal tender
in that sphere
where we have
to do our work.
In fact,
the more energy
we spend stoking up
on support
from colleagues
and loved ones,
the weaker we become
and the less capable
of handling our business.
My friend Carol
had the following dream
at a time
when her life felt
like it was careening
out of control.
She was a passenger
on a bus.
Bruce Springsteen
was driving.
Suddenly,
Springsteen pulled over,
handed Carol the keys
and bolted.
In the dream,
Carol was panicking.
How could she drive
this huge rolling greyhound?
By now,
all the other passengers
were staring.
Clearly,
no one else
was going to step forward
and take charge.
Carol took the wheel.
To her amazement,
she found she could handle it.
Later,
analyzing the dream,
she figured
Bruce Springsteen
was the boss.
The boss of her psyche.
The bus was the vehicle
of her life.
The boss was telling Carol
that it was time
to take the wheel.
More than that,
the dream by actually
setting her down
in the driver's seat
and letting her feel
that she could control
the vehicle on the road
was providing her
with a simulator run
to prime her
with the confidence
that she could actually
take command in her life.
A dream like that
is real support.
It's a check you can cash
when you sit down alone
to do your work.
P.S.
When your deeper self
delivers a dream like that,
don't talk about it.
Don't dilute its power.
The dream is for you.
It's between you
and your muse.
Shut up and use it.
The only exception is
you may share it
with another comrade in arms
if sharing it
will help or encourage
that comrade
in his or her own endeavors.
Let's continue our look
at symptoms of resistance
with resistance
and rationalization.
Rationalization is
resistance's right-hand man.
Its job is to keep us
from feeling the shame
we would feel
if we truly faced
what cowards we are
for not doing our work.
Here's a couple of lines
from The Big Chill.
Michael is the character
played by Jeff Goldblum
in the movie
and Sam is the one
played by Tom Berenger.
Michael,
don't knock rationalization.
Where would we be without it?
I don't know anyone
who can get through the day
without two or three
juicy rationalizations.
They're more important than sex.
Sam,
ah, come on.
Nothing's more important than sex.
Michael,
oh yeah?
Have you ever gone a week
without a rationalization?
But rationalization
has its own sidekick.
It's that part of our psyche
that actually believes
what rationalization tells us.
It's one thing
to lie to ourselves.
It's another thing
to believe it.
Resistance and Rationalization
Part 2
Resistance is fear.
But resistance is too cunning
to show itself naked
in this form.
Why?
Because if resistance
lets us see clearly
that our own fear
is preventing us
from doing our work,
we may feel shame at this.
And shame may drive us
to act in the face of fear.
Resistance doesn't want us
to do this.
So it brings in rationalization.
Rationalization
is resistance's spin doctor.
It's resistance's way
of hiding the big stick
behind its back.
Instead of showing us
our fear,
which might shame us
and impel us to do our work,
resistance presents us
with a series of plausible,
rational justifications
for why we shouldn't
do our work.
What's particularly insidious
about the rationalizations
that resistance presents to us
is that a lot of them are true.
They're legitimate.
Our wife may really be
in her eighth month of pregnancy.
She may in truth
need us at home.
Our department may really be
instituting a changeover
that will eat up
hours of our time.
Indeed, it may make sense
to put off finishing
our dissertation
at least till after
the baby's born.
What resistance leaves out,
of course,
is that all this means diddly.
Tolstoy had 13 kids
and wrote War and Peace.
Lance Armstrong had cancer
and won the Tour de France
six times and counting.
Let's close our look
at symptoms of resistance
with resistance can be beaten.
If resistance couldn't be beaten,
there would be no Fifth Symphony,
no Romeo and Juliet,
no Golden Gate Bridge.
Defeating resistance
is like giving birth.
It seems absolutely impossible
until you remember
that women have been
pulling it off successfully
with support and without
for 50 million years.

Well,

and
say,
what
do you need?
What I do.
I get up, take a shower, have breakfast.
I read the paper, brush my teeth.
If I have phone calls to make, I make them.
I've got my coffee now.
I put on my lucky work boots and stitch up the lucky laces that my niece Meredith gave me.
I head back to the office, crank up the computer.
My lucky hooded sweatshirt is draped over the chair with the lucky charm I got from a gypsy in Saint-Marie's de la Mer for only eight bucks and francs,
and my lucky Largo name tag that came from a dream I once had.
I put it on.
On my thesaurus is my lucky cannon that my friend Bob Versandi gave me from Morrow Castle, Cuba.
I point it toward my chair so it can fire inspiration into me.
I say my prayer, which is the invocation of the muse from Homer's Odyssey, translation by T.E. Lawrence, Lawrence of Arabia,
which my dear mate Paul Rink gave me and which sits near my shelf with the cufflinks that belong to my father
and my lucky acorn from the battlefield at Thermopylae.
It's about 10.30 now.
I sit down and plunge in.
When I start making typos, I know I'm getting tired.
That's four hours or so.
I've hit the point of diminishing returns.
I wrap for the day, copy whatever I've done to disk and stash the disk in the glove compartment of my truck
in case there's a fire and I have to run for it.
I power down.
It's 3.3.30.
The office is closed.
How many pages have I produced?
I don't care.
Are they any good?
I don't even think about it.
All that matters is I put in my time and hit it with all I've got.
All that counts is that for this day, for this session, I have overcome resistance.
Part 2, combating resistance, turning pro.
It is one thing to study war and another to live the warrior's life.
Telamon of Arcadia, mercenary of the 5th century BC.
I'd like to start by talking about the difference between professionals and amateurs.
Aspiring artists and entrepreneurs defeated by resistance share one trait.
They all think like amateurs.
They have not yet turned pro.
The moment an artist or entrepreneur turns pro is as epical as the birth of his first child.
With one stroke, everything changes.
I can state absolutely that the term of my life can be divided into two parts.
Before turning pro and after.
To be clear, when I say professional, I don't mean doctors and lawyers, those of the professions.
I mean the professional as an ideal.
The professional in contrast to the amateur.
Consider the differences.
The amateur plays for fun.
The professional plays for keeps.
To the amateur, the game is his avocation.
To the pro, it's his vocation.
The amateur plays part-time, the professional full-time.
The amateur is a weekend warrior.
The professional is there seven days a week.
The word amateur comes from the Latin root meaning to love.
The conventional interpretation of this is that the amateur pursues his calling out of love
while a pro does it for money.
Not the way I see it.
In my view, the amateur does not love the game enough.
If he did, he would not pursue it as a sideline distinct from his real vocation.
The professional loves it so much, he dedicates his life to it.
He commits full-time.
That's what I mean when I say turning pro.
Resistance hates it when we turn pro.
Let's take a look at a professional.
Someone once asked Somerset Maugham if he wrote on a schedule or only when struck by inspiration.
I write, only when inspiration strikes, he replied.
Fortunately, it strikes every morning at nine o'clock sharp.
That's a pro.
In terms of resistance, Maugham was saying,
I despise resistance.
I will not let it phase me.
I will sit down and do my work.
Maugham reckoned another deeper truth,
that by performing the mundane physical act of sitting down and starting to work,
he set in motion a mysterious but infallible sequence of events
that would produce inspiration,
as surely as if the goddess had synchronized her watch with his.
He knew if he built it, she would come.
What a writer's, artist's, or entrepreneur's day feels like.
I wake up with a gnawing sensation of dissatisfaction.
Already I feel fear.
Already the loved ones around me are starting to fade.
I interact.
I'm present, but I'm not.
I'm not thinking about the work.
I've already consigned that to the muse.
What I am aware of is resistance.
I feel it in my guts.
I afford it the utmost respect
because I know it can defeat me on any given day
as easily as the need for a drink can overcome an alcoholic.
I go through the chores, the correspondence,
the obligations of daily life.
Again, I'm there, but not really.
The clock is running in my head.
I know I can indulge in daily crap for a little while,
but I must cut it off when the bell rings.
I'm keenly aware of the principle of priority,
which states,
A, you must know the difference between what is urgent and what is important,
and B, you must do what's important first.
What's important is the work.
That's the game I have to suit up for.
That's the field on which I have to leave everything that I've got.
Do I really believe that my work is crucial to the planet's survival?
Of course not.
But it's as important to me as catching that mouse is
to the hawk circling outside my window.
He's hungry.
He needs a kill.
So do I.
I'm done with my chores now.
It's time.
I say my prayer and head out on the hunt.
The sun isn't up yet.
It's cold.
The fields are sopping.
Brambles scratch my ankles.
Branches snap back in my face.
The hill is a son of a bitch, but what can you do?
Set one foot in front of another and keep climbing.
An hour passes.
I'm warmer now.
The pace has got my blood going.
The years have taught me one skill.
How to be miserable.
I know how to shut up and keep humping.
This is a great asset because it's human.
The proper role for a mortal.
It does not offend the gods, but elicits their intercession.
My bitching self is receding now.
The instincts are taking over.
Another hour passes.
I turn the corner of a thicket and there he is.
The nice fat rabbit I knew would show up if I just kept plugging.
Home from the hill, I thank the immortals and offer up their portion of the kill.
They brought it to me.
They deserve their share.
I'm grateful.
I joke with my kids beside the fire.
They're happy.
The old man has brought home the bacon.
The old lady's happy.
She's cooking it up.
I'm happy.
I've earned my keep on the planet, at least for this day.
Resistance is not a factor now.
I don't think of the hunt and I don't think of the office.
The tension drains from my neck and back.
What I feel and say and do this night will not be coming from any disowned or unresolved
part of myself, any part corrupted by resistance.
I go to sleep content, but my final thought is of resistance.
I will wake up with it tomorrow.
Already, I am stealing myself.
How to be miserable.
In my younger days, dodging the draft, I somehow wound up in the Marine Corps.
There's a myth that Marine training turns baby-faced recruits into bloodthirsty killers.
Trust me, the Marine Corps is not that efficient.
What it does teach, however, is a lot more useful.
The Marine Corps teaches you how to be miserable.
This is invaluable for an artist or entrepreneur.
Marines love to be miserable.
Marines derive a perverse satisfaction in having colder chow, crappier equipment, and higher
casualty rates than any outfit of dog faces, swab jockeys, or flyboys, all of whom they despise.
Why?
Because these candy asses don't know how to be miserable.
The artist or entrepreneur committing himself to his calling has volunteered for hell, whether
he knows it or not.
He will be dining for the duration on a diet of isolation, rejection, self-doubt, despair,
ridicule, contempt, and humiliation.
The artist or entrepreneur must be like that Marine.
He has to know how to be miserable.
He has to love being miserable.
He has to take pride in being more miserable than any soldier or swabby or jet jockey.
Because this is war, baby, and war is hell.
We're all pros already.
All of us are pros in one area, our jobs.
We get a paycheck.
We work for money.
We are professionals.
Now, are there principles we can take from what we're already successfully doing in our
work-a-day life and apply to our artistic or entrepreneurial aspirations?
What exactly are the qualities that define us as professionals?
One, we show up every day.
We might do it only because we have to, to keep from getting fired, but we do it.
We show up every day.
Two, we show up no matter what.
In sickness and in health, come hell or high water, we stagger into the factory.
We might do it only so as not to let down our coworkers or for other less noble reasons,
but we do it.
We show up no matter what.
Three, we stay on the job all day.
Our minds may wander, but our bodies remain at the wheel.
We pick up the phone when it rings.
We assist the customer when he seeks our help.
We don't go home till the whistle blows.
Four, we are committed over the long haul.
Next year, we may go to another job, another company, another country, but we'll still
be working.
Until we hit the lottery, we are part of the labor force.
Five, the stakes for us are high and real.
This is about survival, feeding our families, educating our children.
It's about eating.
Six, we accept remuneration for our labor.
We're not here for fun.
We work for money.
Seven, we do not over-identify with our jobs.
We may take pride in our work.
We may stay late and come in on weekends, but we recognize that we are not our job descriptions.
The amateur, on the other hand, over-identifies with his avocation, his artistic aspiration.
He defines himself by it.
He is a musician, a painter, a playwright.
Resistance loves this.
Resistance knows that the amateur composer will never write his symphony because he is
overly invested in its success and over-terrified of its failure.
The amateur takes it so seriously, it paralyzes him.
Eight, we master the technique of our jobs.
Nine, we have a sense of humor about our jobs.
Ten, we receive praise or blame in the real world.
Now consider the amateur, the aspiring painter, the wannabe playwright, the budding entrepreneur.
How does he pursue his calling?
One, he doesn't show up every day.
Two, he doesn't show up no matter what.
Three, he doesn't stay on the job all day.
He is not committed over the long haul.
The stakes for him are illusory and fake.
He does not get money, and he over-identifies with his art or calling.
He does not have a sense of humor about failure.
You don't hear him bitching, this freaking trilogy is killing me.
Instead, he doesn't write his trilogy at all.
The amateur has not mastered the technique of his art, nor does he expose himself to judgment
in the real world.
If we show our poem to our friend and our friend says, it's wonderful, I love it, that's not
real-world feedback.
That's our friend being nice to us.
Nothing is as empowering as real-world validation, even if it's for failure.
The first professional writing job I ever had, after 17 years of trying, was on a movie
called King Kong Lives.
I and my partner at the time, Ron Shusett, a brilliant writer and producer who also did
Alien and Total Recall, hammered out a screenplay for Dino De Laurentiis.
We loved it.
We were sure we had a hit.
Even after we'd seen the finished film, we were certain it was a blockbuster.
We invited everyone we knew to the premiere, even rented out the joint next door for a post-triumph
blowout.
Get there early, we warned our friends.
The place will be mobbed.
Nobody showed.
There was only one guy in line beside our guest, and he was muttering something about spare
change.
In the theater, our friends endured the movie in mute stupefaction.
When the lights came up, they fled like cockroaches into the night.
Next came the review in Variety.
Quote, Ronald Shusett and Steven Pressfield, we hope these are not their real names for their
parents' sake.
When the first week's grosses came in, the flick barely registered.
Still, I clung to hope.
Maybe it's only tanking in urban areas.
Maybe it's playing better in the burbs.
I motored to an edge city multiplex.
A youth manned the popcorn booth.
How's King Kong Lives?
I asked.
He flashed thumbs down.
Miss it, man.
It sucks.
I was crushed.
Here I was, 42 years old, divorced, childless, having given up all normal human pursuits
to chase the dream of being a writer.
Now I finally got my name on a big-time Hollywood production starring Linda Hamilton.
What happens?
I'm a loser, a phony.
My life is worthless, and so am I.
My friend Tony Keppelman snapped me out of it by asking if I was going to quit.
Hell no.
Then be happy, he said.
You're where you wanted to be, aren't you?
So you're taking a few blows.
That's the price of being in the arena and not on the sidelines.
Stop complaining and be grateful.
That was when I realized I had become a pro.
I had not yet had a success, but I had had a real failure.
Next, let's take a look at something I call For Love of the Game.
To clarify a point about professionalism,
the professional, though he accepts money, does his work out of love.
He has to love it, otherwise he wouldn't devote his life to it of his own free will.
The professional has learned, however, that too much love can be a bad thing.
Too much love can make him choke.
The seeming detachment of the professional,
the cold-blooded character to his demeanor,
is a compensating device to keep him from loving the game so much that he freezes in action.
Playing for money, or adopting the attitude of one who plays for money,
lowers the fever.
Remember what we said about fear, love, and resistance.
The more you love your art, calling, enterprise,
the more important its accomplishment is to the evolution of your soul,
the more you will fear it,
and the more resistance you will experience facing it.
The payoff of playing the game for money is not the money,
which you may never see anyway, even after you turn pro.
The payoff is that playing the game for money
produces the proper professional attitude.
It inculcates the lunch pail mentality,
the hardcore, hard-head, hard-hat state of mind
that shows up for work despite rain or snow or dark of night
and slugs it out day after day.
The writer or entrepreneur is an infantryman.
He knows that progress is measured in yards of dirt
extracted from the enemy one day, one hour, one minute at a time,
and paid for in blood.
The artist or entrepreneur wears combat boots.
He looks in the mirror and sees G.I. Joe.
Remember, the muse favors working stiffs.
She hates prima donnas.
To the gods, the supreme sin is not rape or murder, but pride.
To think of yourself as a mercenary,
a gun for hire implants the proper humility.
It purges pride and preciousness.
Resistance loves pride and preciousness.
Resistance says,
show me a writer or entrepreneur who's too good
to take job X or assignment Y,
and I'll show you a guy I can crack like a walnut.
Technically, the professional takes money.
Technically, the pro plays for pay.
But in the end, he does it for love.
Now let's consider what are the aspects of the professional.
The first is, a professional is patient.
Resistance outwits the amateur with the oldest trick in the book.
It uses his own enthusiasm against him.
Resistance gets us to plunge into a project
with an over-ambitious and unrealistic timetable for its completion.
It knows we can't sustain that level of intensity.
We will hit the wall.
We will crash.
The professional, on the other hand,
understands delayed gratification.
He is the ant, not the grasshopper.
The tortoise, not the hare.
Have you heard the legend of Sylvester Stallone
staying up three nights straight
to churn out the screenplay for Rocky?
I don't know, it may even be true.
But it's the most pernicious species of myth
to set before the awakening writer or budding entrepreneur
because it seduces him into believing
he can pull off the big score
without pain and without persistence.
The professional arms himself with patience,
not only to give the stars time to align in his career,
but to keep himself from flaming out
in each individual work.
He knows that any job,
whether it's a novel or a kitchen remodel,
takes twice as long as he thinks
and costs twice as much.
He accepts that.
He recognizes it as reality.
The professional steals himself
at the start of his project,
reminding himself that it is the Iditarod,
not the 60-yard dash.
He conserves his energy.
He prepares his mind for the long haul.
He sustains himself with the knowledge
that if he can just keep those huskies mushing,
sooner or later the sled will pull into Gnome.
The professional seeks order.
When I lived in the back of my Chevy van,
I had to dig my typewriter out
from beneath layers of tired tools,
dirty laundering, and moldering paperbacks.
My truck was a nest, a hive,
a hellhole on wheels whose sleeping surface
I had to clear each night
just to carve out a foxhole to snooze in.
Professionals cannot live like that.
They are on a mission.
They will not tolerate disorder.
They eliminate chaos from their world
in order to banish it from their minds.
They want the carpet vacuumed
and the threshold swept
so the muse may enter
and not soil her gown.
A professional demystifies.
A pro views her work as craft, not art.
Not because she believes art
is devoid of a mystical dimension.
On the contrary,
she understands that all creative endeavor is holy,
but she doesn't dwell on it.
She knows if she thinks about that too much,
it'll paralyze her.
So she concentrates on technique.
The professional masters how
and leaves what and why to the gods.
Like Somerset Maugham,
she doesn't wait for inspiration.
She acts in the anticipation of its apparition.
The professional is acutely aware
of the intangibles that go into inspiration.
Out of respect for them,
she lets them work.
She grants them their sphere
while she concentrates on hers.
The sign of the amateur
is over-glorification of
and preoccupation with the mystery.
The professional shuts up.
She doesn't talk about it.
She does her work.
Continuing the characteristics of a professional,
the professional acts in the face of fear.
The amateur believes
he must first overcome his fear,
then he can do his work.
The professional knows
that fear can never be overcome.
He knows there is no such thing
as a fearless warrior
or a dread-free artist or entrepreneur.
What Henry Fonda does,
after puking into the toilet
in his dressing room,
is to clean up and march out on stage.
He's still terrified,
but he forces himself forward
in spite of his terror.
He knows that once he gets out
into the action,
his fear will recede
and he'll be okay.
A professional accepts no excuses.
The amateur,
underestimating resistance as cunning,
permits the flu to keep him
from his chapters.
He believes the serpent's voice
in his head that says
mailing off that manuscript
is more important
than doing the day's work.
The professional has learned better.
He respects resistance.
He knows if he caves in today,
no matter how plausible a pretext,
he'll be twice as likely
to cave in tomorrow.
The professional knows
that resistance is like a telemarketer.
If you so much as say hello,
you're finished.
The pro doesn't even pick up the phone.
He stays at work.
The professional plays it as it lays.
My friend the hawk and I
were playing the first hole
at Prestwick in Scotland.
The wind was howling out of the left.
I started an eight iron
thirty yards to windward,
but the gale caught it.
I watched in dismay
as the ball sailed hard right,
hit the green going sideways,
and bounded off into the cabbage.
Son of a bitch,
I turned to our caddy.
Did you see the wind take that shot?
He gave me that look
that only Scottish caddies can give.
Well, you've got to play the wind now,
don't you?
The professional conducts his business
in the real world.
Adversity, injustice,
bad hops and rotten calls,
even good breaks and lucky bounces,
all comprise the ground
over which the campaign must be waged.
The field is level,
the professional understands,
only in heaven.
A professional is prepared.
I'm not talking about craft,
that goes without saying.
The professional is prepared
at a deeper level.
He is prepared each day
to confront his own self-sabotage.
The professional understands
that resistance is fertile and ingenious.
It will throw stuff at him
that he's never seen before.
The professional prepares mentally
to absorb blows and to deliver them.
His aim is to take what the day gives him.
He is prepared to be prudent
and prepared to be reckless,
to take a beating when he has to
and to go for the throat when he can.
He understands that the field
alters every day.
His goal is not victory.
Success will come by itself
when it wants to,
but to handle himself,
his insides,
as sturdily and as steadily as he can.
Next, a professional does not show off.
A professional's work has style.
It is distinctively his own,
but he doesn't let his signature
grandstand for him.
His style serves the material.
He does not impose it
as a means of drawing attention to himself.
This doesn't mean that the professional
doesn't throw down a 360 tomahawk jam
from time to time
just to let the boys know
he's still in business.
Next, a professional dedicates himself
to mastering technique.
The professional respects his craft.
He does not consider himself
superior to it.
He recognizes the contributions
of those who have gone before him.
He apprentices himself to them.
The professional dedicates himself
to mastering technique,
not because he believes technique
is a substitute for inspiration,
but because he wants to be in possession
of the full arsenal of skills
when inspiration does come.
The professional is sly.
He knows that by toiling beside
the front door of technique,
he leaves room for genius
to enter by the back.
A professional does not hesitate
to ask for help.
Tiger Woods is the greatest golfer
in the world.
Yet he has teachers.
He has worked with Butch Harmon
and Hank Haney.
And Tiger doesn't endure this instruction
or suffer through it.
He revels in it.
It's his keenest professional joy
to get out there on the practice tee
with his teachers
to learn more about the game he loves.
Tiger Woods is the consummate professional.
It would never occur to him
as it would to an amateur
that he knows everything
or can figure everything out on his own.
On the contrary,
he seeks out the most knowledgeable teacher
and listens with both ears.
The student of the game knows
that the levels of revelation
that can unfold in golf,
as in any art or enterprise,
are inexhaustible.
A professional distances herself
from her instrument.
The pro stands at one remove
from her instrument,
meaning her person,
her body,
her voice,
her talent,
the physical,
mental,
emotional,
and psychological being
she uses in her work.
She does not identify
with this instrument.
It is simply what God gave her,
what she has to work with.
She assesses it coolly,
impersonally,
objectively.
The professional identifies
with her consciousness
and her will,
not with the matter
that her consciousness
and will manipulate
to serve her art or enterprise.
Does Madonna walk around the house
in cone bras
and stainless steel bustiers?
She's too busy planning D-Day.
Madonna does not identify
with Madonna.
Madonna employs Madonna.
Another aspect of the professional
is a professional
does not take failure
or success personally.
When people say an artist
or an entrepreneur
has a thick skin,
what they mean is not
that the person is dense
or numb,
but that he has seeded
his professional consciousness
in a place
other than his personal ego.
It takes tremendous strength
of character to do this
because our deepest instincts
run counter to it.
Evolution has programmed us
to feel rejection
in our guts.
This is how the tribe
enforced obedience,
by wielding the threat
of expulsion.
Fear of rejection
isn't just psychological,
it's biological.
It's in our cells.
Resistance knows this
and uses it against us.
It uses fear of rejection
to paralyze us
and prevent us,
if not from doing our work,
then from exposing it
to public evaluation.
I had a dear friend
who had labored for years
on an excellent
and deeply personal novel.
It was done.
He had it in the mailing box,
but he couldn't make himself
send it off.
Fear of rejection
unmanned him.
The professional
cannot take rejection
personally
because to do so
reinforces resistance.
Editors are not the enemy.
Critics are not the enemy.
Resistance is the enemy.
The battle is inside
our own heads.
We cannot let
external criticism,
even if it's true,
fortify our internal foe.
That foe is strong
enough already.
A professional
schools herself
to stand apart
from her performance,
even as she gives
herself to it
heart and soul.
The Bhagavad Gita
tells us we have a right
only to our labor,
not to the fruits
of our labor.
All the warrior
can give is his life.
All the athlete
can do is leave
everything on the field.
The professional
loves her work.
She is invested
in it wholeheartedly,
but she does not forget
that the work
is not her.
Her artistic self
contains many works
and many performances.
Already,
the next is percolating
inside her.
The next will be better
and the one after that
better still.
The professional
self-validates.
She is tough-minded.
In the face of indifference
or adulation,
she assesses her stuff
coldly and objectively.
Where it fell short,
she'll improve it.
Where it triumphed,
she'll make it better still.
She'll work harder,
she'll be back tomorrow.
The professional
gives an ear
to criticism,
seeking to learn
and grow.
But she never forgets
that resistance
is using criticism
against her
on a far more
diabolical level.
Resistance enlists
criticism to reinforce
the fifth column of fear
already at work
inside the artist
or entrepreneur's head,
seeking to break her will
and crack her dedication.
The professional
does not fall for this.
Her resolution
before all others
remains,
no matter what,
I will never let
resistance beat me.
A professional
endures adversity.
I had been in Tinseltown
five years,
had finished nine screenplays
on spec,
none of which had sold.
Finally,
I got a meeting
with a big producer.
He kept taking phone calls
even as I pitched my stuff.
He had one of those
headset things
so he didn't even have
to pick up a receiver.
The calls came in
and he took them.
Finally,
one came that was personal.
Would you mind,
he asked,
indicating the door,
I need some privacy
on this one.
I exited.
The door closed behind me.
Ten minutes passed.
I was standing out
by the secretaries.
Twenty more minutes passed.
Finally,
the producer's door opened.
He came out
pulling on his jacket.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
He had forgotten
all about me.
I'm human.
This hurt.
I wasn't a kid either.
I was in my forties
with a rap sheet of failure
as long as your arm.
The professional
cannot let himself
take humiliation personally.
Humiliation,
like rejection
and criticism,
is the external reflection
of internal resistance.
The professional
endures adversity.
He lets the bird crap
splash down
on his slicker,
remembering that it
comes clean
with a heavy-duty hosing.
He himself,
his creative center,
cannot be buried
even under
a mountain of guano.
His core is bulletproof.
Nothing can touch it
unless he lets it.
I saw a fat,
happy old guy
once in his Cadillac
on the freeway.
He had the A.C.
going,
pointer sisters on the CD,
puffing on a stogie.
His license plate read,
dues paid.
The professional
keeps his eye
on the donut
and not on the hole.
He reminds himself
it's better to be
in the arena
getting stomped
by the bull
than it is to be
up in the stands
or out in the parking lot.
A professional
self-validates.
An amateur
lets the negative opinion
of others unman him.
He takes external
criticism to heart
allowing it to trump
his own belief
in himself
and his work.
Resistance loves this.
Can you stand
another Tiger Woods story?
With four holes to go
on the final day
of the 2001 Masters,
which Tiger went on
to win completing
the all four majors
at one time slam,
some chucklehead
in the gallery
snapped a camera shutter
at the top
of Tiger's backswing.
Incredibly,
Tiger was able
to pull up
in mid-swing
and back off the shot.
But that wasn't
the amazing part.
After looking daggers
at the malefactor,
Tiger recomposed himself,
stepped back to the ball,
and striped it
310 down the middle.
That's a professional.
It is tough-mindedness
at a level
most of us
can't comprehend,
let alone emulate.
But let's look
more closely
at what Tiger did,
or rather
what he didn't do.
First,
he didn't react
reflexively.
He didn't allow
an act that by all rights
should have provoked
an automatic response
of rage
to actually produce
that rage.
He controlled
his reaction.
He governed
his emotion.
Second,
he didn't take it
personally.
He could have perceived
this Shutterbug's act
as a deliberate blow
aimed at him individually
with the intention
of throwing him
off his shot.
He could have reacted
with outrage
or indignation
or cast himself
as a victim.
He didn't.
Third,
he didn't take it
as a sign
of heaven's malevolence.
He could have
experienced this bolt
as the malice
of the golfing gods
like a bad hop
in baseball
or a linesman's
miscall in tennis.
He could have groaned
or sulked
or surrendered
mentally to this
injustice,
this interference,
and used it
as an excuse
to fail.
He didn't.
What he did do
was maintain
his sovereignty
over the moment.
He understood
that no matter
what blow
had befallen him
from an outside agency,
he himself
still had his job
to do the shot
he needed to hit
right here,
right now.
And he knew
that it remained
within his power
to produce that shot.
Nothing stood
in his way
except whatever
emotional upset
he himself
chose to hold
on to.
Tiger's mother,
Kultita,
is a Buddhist.
Perhaps from her
he had learned
compassion
to let go of fury
at the heedlessness
of an overzealous
shutter clicker.
In any event,
Tiger Woods,
the ultimate professional,
vented his anger
quickly with a look,
then recomposed himself
and returned
to the task at hand.
The professional
cannot allow
the actions of others
to define his reality.
Tomorrow morning,
the critic will be gone,
but the writer
will still be there
facing the blank page.
Nothing matters
but that he keep working.
Short of a family crisis
or the outbreak
of World War III,
the professional shows up
ready to serve the gods.
Remember,
resistance wants us
to cede sovereignty
to others.
It wants us
to stake our self-worth,
our identity,
our reason for being
on the response
of others
to our work.
Resistance knows
we can't take this.
No one can.
The professional
blows critics off.
He doesn't even hear them.
Critics,
he reminds himself,
are the unwitting
mouthpieces of resistance
and as such
can be truly cunning
and pernicious.
They can articulate
in their reviews
the same toxic venom
that resistance itself
concocts inside our heads.
That's their real evil.
Not that we believe them,
but that we believe
the resistance
in our own minds
for which critics
serve as unconscious
spokespersons.
The professional
learns to recognize
envy-driven criticism
and to take it
for what it is,
the supreme compliment.
The critic hates most
that which he would
have done himself
if he had had the guts.
A professional
recognizes her limitations.
She gets an agent.
She gets a lawyer.
She gets an accountant.
She knows she can only
be a professional
at one thing.
She brings in other pros
and treats them
with respect.
The professional
A professional
reinvents himself.
Goldie Hawn
once observed
that there are only
three ages
for an actress
in Hollywood.
Babe,
D.A.,
and Driving Miss Daisy.
She was making
a different point,
but the truth remains.
As artists
or entrepreneurs,
we serve the muse,
and the muse may have
more than one job
for us over our lifetime.
The professional
does not permit himself
to become hidebound
within one incarnation,
however comfortable
or successful.
Like a transmigrating soul,
he shucks his outworn body
and dons a new one.
He continues his journey.
A professional
is recognized
by other professionals.
The professional senses
who has served his time
and who hasn't.
Like Alan Ladd
and Jack Palance
circling each other
in Shane,
a gun recognizes
another gun.
Let's continue our look
at aspects of the professional
with a concept
I call
You Incorporated.
When I first moved
to Los Angeles
and made the acquaintance
of working screenwriters,
I learned that many
had their own corporations.
They provided
their writing services
not as themselves,
but as loan outs
from their one-man businesses.
Their writing contracts
were FSO,
for services of
themselves.
I had never seen this before.
I thought it was pretty cool.
For a writer
to incorporate himself
has certain tax
and financial advantages.
But what I love about it
is the metaphor.
I like the idea
of being myself
incorporated.
That way I can wear
two hats.
I can hire myself
and fire myself.
I can even,
as Robin Williams
once remarked
of writer-producers,
blow smoke up
my own ass.
Making yourself
a corporation
or just thinking
of yourself that way
reinforces the idea
of professionalism
because it separates
the artist
doing the work
from the will
and consciousness
running the show.
No matter how much abuse
is heaped on the head
of the former,
the latter takes it in stride
and keeps on trucking.
Conversely,
with success,
you the writer
or you the entrepreneur
may get a swelled head,
but you the boss
remember how to take
yourself down a peg.
Have you ever worked
in an office?
Then you know about
Monday morning status meetings.
The group assembles
in the conference room
and the boss
goes over
what assignments
each team member
is responsible for
in the coming week.
When the meeting breaks up,
an assistant prepares
a worksheet
and distributes it.
When this hits your desk
an hour later,
you know exactly
what you have to do
this week.
I have one of those
meetings with myself
every Monday.
I sit down
and go over my assignments.
Then I type it up
and distribute it to myself.
I have corporate stationery
and corporate business cards
and a corporate checkbook.
I write off corporate expenses
and pay corporate taxes.
I have different credit cards
for myself
and my corporation.
If we think of ourselves
as a corporation,
it gives us a healthy
distance on ourselves.
We're less subjective.
We don't take blows
as personally.
We're more cold-blooded.
We can price our wares
more realistically.
Sometimes,
as Joe Blow himself,
I'm too mild-mannered
to go out and sell.
But as Joe Blow Incorporated,
I can pimp the hell
out of myself.
I'm not me anymore.
I'm me incorporated.
I'm a pro.
Next,
a critter that keeps coming.
Why does resistance
yield to our turning pro?
Because resistance
is a bully.
Resistance has no strength
of its own.
Its power derives
entirely from our fear of it.
A bully will back down
before the runtiest twerp
who stands his ground.
The essence of professionalism
is the focus upon the work
and its demands
while we are doing it
to the exclusion of all else.
The ancient Spartans
schooled themselves
to regard the enemy,
any enemy,
as nameless and faceless.
In other words,
they believed that
if they did their work,
no force on earth
could stand against them.
In The Searchers,
John Wayne and Jeffrey Hunter
pursue the war chief Scar,
who has kidnapped
their young kinswoman
played by Natalie Wood.
Winter stops them,
but Wayne's character,
Ethan Edwards,
does not slacken his resolve.
He'll return to the trail
in spring, he declares,
and sooner or later,
the fugitive's vigilance
will slacken.
Here's the quote,
Ethan,
Seems he never learns
there's such a thing
as a critter
that might just keep coming on.
So we'll find him in the end,
I promise you that,
just as sure as
the turning of the earth.
A pro keeps coming on.
He beats resistance
at its own game
by being even more resolute
and even more implacable
than it is.
Let's conclude our look
at aspects of the professional
with something I call
no mystery.
There's no mystery
to turning pro.
It's a decision brought about
by an act of will.
We make up our minds
to view ourselves as pros,
and we do it.
Simple as that.

Part 3
This opening quote comes from ancient Athens, a pamphlet called The Cavalry Commander.
Quote,
I'd like to start off by talking about something I call Angels in the Abstract.
The next few segments are going to be about those invisible psychic forces that support
and sustain us in our journey toward ourselves. I plan on using terms like muses and angels.
Does that make you uncomfortable? If it does, you have my permission to think of angels in the
abstract. Consider these forces as being impersonal as gravity. Maybe they are. It's not hard to
believe, is it, that a force exists in every grain and seed to make it grow? Or that in every kitten
or colt is an instinct that impels it to run and play and learn? Just as resistance can be thought
of as personal, I've said resistance loves such and such or hates such and such, it can also be
viewed as a force of nature as impersonal as entropy or molecular decay. Similarly, the call to growth
can be conceptualized as personal, a demon or genius, an angel or a muse, or as impersonal like the tides
or the transiting of Venus. Either way works as long as we're comfortable with it. Or if extra
dimensionality doesn't sit well with you in any form, think of it as talent programmed into our genes by
evolution. The point for the thesis I'm seeking to put forward is that there are forces we can call
our allies. As resistance works to keep us from becoming who we were born to be, equal and opposite
powers are counterpoised against it. These are our allies and angels.
Next, approaching the mystery. Why have I stressed professionalism so heavily in the preceding segments?
Because the most important thing about art or enterprise is to work. Nothing else matters except
sitting down every day and trying. Why is this so important? Because when we sit down day after day
and keep grinding, something mysterious starts to happen. A process is set into motion by which,
inevitably and infallibly, heaven comes to our aid. Unseen forces enlist in our cause.
Serendipity reinforces our purpose. This is the other secret that real artists and entrepreneurs know
and that wannabe artists and entrepreneurs don't. When we sit down each day and do our work,
power concentrates around us. The muse takes note of our dedication. She approves. We have earned favor
in her sight. When we sit down and work, we become like a magnetized rod that attracts iron filings.
Ideas come. Insights accrete. Just as resistance has its seat in hell, so creation has its home in heaven.
And it's not just a witness, but an eager and active ally. What I call professionalism someone
else might call the artist's code or the warrior's way or the entrepreneur's method. It's an attitude
of egolessness and service. The knights of the round table were chaste and self-effacing,
yet they dueled dragons. We're facing dragons too. Fire-breathing griffins of the soul whom we must
out-fight and outwit to reach the treasure of our self and potential and to release the maiden who is
God's plan and destiny for ourselves and the answer to why we were put on this planet.
Invoking the Muse
The quote from Xenophon that opens this session comes from a pamphlet called The Cavalry Commander,
in which the celebrated warrior and historian prefers instruction to those young gentlemen
who aspired to be officers in the Athenian Equestrian Corps. He declares that the commander's
first duty, before he mucks out a stable or seeks funding from the Defense Review Board,
is to sacrifice to the gods and invoke their aid. I do the same thing. The last thing I do before I sit
down to work is say my prayer to the muse. I say it out loud in absolute earnest. Only then do I get down
to business. In my late twenties, I rented a little house in Northern California. I had gone there to
finish a novel or kill myself trying. By that time, I had blown up a marriage to a girl I loved with all
my heart, screwed up two careers, blah, blah, etc., all because, though I had no understanding of this
at the time, I could not handle resistance. I had one novel nine-tenths of the way through and another
at ninety-nine hundredths before I threw them in the trash. I couldn't finish them. I didn't have
the guts. In yielding thusly to resistance, I fell prey to every vice, evil, distraction, you name it,
mentioned heretofore, all leading nowhere, and finally washed up in this sleepy California town
with my Chevy van, my cat Moe, and my antique Smith Corona. A guy named Paul Rink lived down the
street. Look him up. He's in Henry Miller's Big Sur and the Oranges of Hieronymus Bosch.
Paul was a writer. He lived in his camper, Moby Dick. I started each day over coffee with Paul.
He turned me on to all kinds of authors I had never heard of, lectured me on self-discipline,
dedication, the evils of the marketplace, but best of all, he shared with me his prayer,
the invocation of the muse from Homer's Odyssey, the T.E. Lawrence translation.
Paul typed it out for me on his even more ancient than mine, Manuel Remington. I still have it.
It's yellow and parched as dust. The merest puff would blow it to powder.
In my little house, I had no TV. I never read a newspaper or went to a movie. I just worked.
One afternoon, I was banging away in my little bedroom that I had converted to an office
when I heard my neighbor's radio playing outside. Someone in a loud voice was declaiming,
to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States.
I came out. What's going on? Didn't you hear my neighbor said? Nixon's out. They got a new guy in
there. I had missed Watergate completely. I was determined to keep working. I had failed so many
times and caused myself and people I loved so much pain thereby that I felt if I crapped out this time,
I would have to hang myself. I didn't know what resistance was then. No one had schooled me in the
concept. I felt it, though, big time. I experienced it as a compulsion to self-destruct. I could not
finish what I started. The closer I got, the more different ways I'd find to screw it up.
I worked for 26 months straight, taken only two out for a stint of migrant labor in Washington State,
and finally one day I got to the last page and typed out the end. I never did find a buyer for
that book or the next one either. It was ten years before I got the first check for something I had
written and ten more before a novel, The Legend of Bagger Vance, was actually published. But that
moment when I first hit the keys to spell out the end was epical. I remember rolling the last page out
and adding it to the stack that was the finished manuscript. Nobody knew I was done. Nobody cared.
But I knew. I felt like a dragon I'd been fighting all my life had just dropped dead at my feet and
gasped out its last sulfuric breath. Rest in peace, you son of a bitch. The next morning I went over to
Paul's for coffee and told him I had finished. Good for you, he said, without looking up. Start the next
one today. Invoking the Muse Part Two
Before I met Paul, I had never heard of the muses. He enlightened me. The muses were nine sisters,
daughters of Zeus and Mnemosyne, which means memory. Their names are Cleo, Erato, Thalia,
Terpsichore, Calliope, Polyhymnia, Euterpe, Melpomene, and Urania. Their job is to inspire artists.
Each muse is responsible for a different art. There's a neighborhood in New Orleans where the
streets are named after the muses. I lived there once and had no idea. I thought they were just
weird names. Here's a quote from Socrates in Plato's Phaedrus on, quote, the noble effect of
heaven-sent madness. The third type of possession and madness is possession by the muses. When this
seizes upon a gentle and virgin soul, it rouses it to inspired expression in lyric and other sorts of
poetry and glorifies countless deeds of the heroes of old for the instruction of
posterity. But if a man comes to the door of poetry untouched by the madness of the muses,
believing the technique alone will make him a good poet, he and his sane compositions never reach
perfection, but are utterly eclipsed by the performances of the inspired madman.
The Greek way of apprehending the mystery was to personify it. The ancients sensed powerful
primordial forces in the world. To make them approachable, they gave them human faces.
They called them Zeus, Apollo, Aphrodite. American Indians felt the same mystery but rendered it in
animistic forms. Bear, teacher, hawk, messenger, coyote, trickster. Our ancestors were keenly cognizant
of forces and energies whose seat was not in this material sphere but in a loftier, more mysterious
one. What did they believe about this higher reality? First, they believed that death did not
exist there. The gods are immortal. The gods, though not unlike humans, are infinitely more powerful.
To defy their will is futile. To act toward heaven with pride is to call down calamity.
Time and space display an altered existence in this higher dimension. The gods travel, quote,
swift as thought. They can tell the future, some of them. And though the playwright Agathon tells us,
quote, this alone is denied to God the power to undo the past, unquote. Yet the immortals can play
tricks with time, as we ourselves may sometimes, in dreams or visions. The universe, the Greeks
believed, was not indifferent. The gods take an interest in human affairs and intercede for good
or ill in our designs. The contemporary view is that all this is charming but preposterous.
Is it? Then answer this. Where did Hamlet come from? Where did the Parthenon come from? Where did
nude descending a staircase come from?
Next, Testament of a Visionary. A quote from the visionary poet William Blake.
Eternity is in love with the creations of time. William Blake was, so I understand,
one of those half-mad avatars who appear in flesh from time to time. Savants capable of ascending for
brief periods to loftier planes and returning to share the wonders they have seen. Shall we try to
decipher the meaning of the verse? What Blake means by eternity, I think, is the sphere higher than this
one, a plane of reality superior to the material dimension in which we dwell. In eternity, there's no
such thing as time, or Blake's syntax wouldn't distinguish it from eternity, and probably no
space either. This plane may be inhabited by higher creatures, or it may be pure consciousness or spirit,
but whatever it is, according to Blake, it's capable of being, quote, in love, unquote. If beings inhabit
this plane, I take Blake to mean that they are incorporeal. They don't have bodies, but they have a
connection to the sphere of time, the one we live in. These gods or spirits participate in this
dimension. They take an interest in it. Eternity is in love with the creations of time means to me
that in some way these creatures of the higher sphere, or the sphere itself in the abstract,
take joy in what we time-bound beings can bring forth into physical existence in our limited material
sphere. It may be pushing the envelope, but if these beings take joy in the, quote, creations of time,
unquote, might they not also nudge us a little to produce them? If that's true, then the image of the
muse whispering inspiration in the artist's ear is quite apt, the timeless communicating to the time
bound. By Blake's model, as I understand it, it's as though the Fifth Symphony existed already in that
higher sphere before Beethoven sat down and played da-da-da-dum. The catch was this. The work existed
only as potential, without a body, so to speak. It wasn't music yet. You couldn't play it. You
couldn't hear it. It needed someone. It needed a corporeal being, a human, an artist, or more precisely
a genius in a Latin sense of soul or animating spirit, to bring it into being on this material
plane. So the muse whispered in Beethoven's ear. Maybe she hummed a few bars into a million other
ears, but no one else heard her. Only Beethoven got it. He brought it forth. He made the Fifth Symphony
a creation of time which eternity could be in love with. So that eternity, whether we conceive of it as
God, pure consciousness, infinite intelligence, omniscient spirit, or if we choose to think of
it as beings, gods, spirits, avatars, when it or they hear somehow the sounds of earthly music,
it brings them joy. In other words, Blake agrees with the Greeks. The gods do exist. They do penetrate
our earthly sphere. Which brings us back to the muse. The muse, remember, is the daughter of Zeus,
father of the gods, and memory, mimosony. That's a pretty impressive pedigree. I'll accept those
credentials. I'll take Xenophon at his word. Before I sit down to work, I'll take a minute and show
respect to this unseen power who can make or break me. Invoking the Muse Part 3
Artists have invoked the muse since time immemorial. There is great wisdom to this. There is magic to
effacing our human arrogance and humbly entreating help from a source we cannot see, hear, touch, or
smell. Here's the start of Homer's Odyssey, the T.E. Lawrence translation. That's Lawrence of Arabia.
O Divine Poesy! Goddess, daughter of Zeus, sustain for me this song of the various-minded man who,
after he had plundered the innermost citadel of hallowed Troy, was made to stray grievously
about the coasts of men, the sport of their customs good and bad, while his heart, through
all the seafaring, ached with an agony to redeem himself and bring his company safe home. Vain hope
for them, the fools, their own witlessness cast them aside, to destroy for meat the oxen of the
most exalted sun, wherefore the sun-god blotted out the day of their return. Make this tale live for us
in all its many bearings, O Muse! This passage will reward closer study. First, Divine Poesy. When we
invoke the Muse, we are calling on a force not just from a different plane of reality, but from a holier
plane. Goddess, daughter of Zeus. Not only are we invoking divine intercession, but intercession on the
highest level, just one removed from the top. Sustain for me. Homer doesn't ask for brilliance
or success. He just wants to keep this thing going. This song. That about covers it. From the
Brothers Karamazov to your new venture in the plumbing supply business. I love the summation of
Odysseus' trials that comprises the body of the invocation. It's Joseph Campbell's hero's journey in a
nutshell, as concise a synopsis of the story of every man as it gets. There's the initial crime,
which we all inevitably commit, which ejects the hero from his homebound complacency and propels him
upon his wanderings. The yearnings for redemption, the untiring campaign to get home, meaning back to
God's grace, back to himself. I admire particularly the warning against the second crime, quote,
to destroy for meat the oxen of the most exalted son, unquote. That's the felony that calls down
soul destruction. The employment of the sacred for profane means. Prostitution, in other words,
selling out. Lastly, the artist's wish for his work, quote, make this tale live for us in all its many
bearings, oh muse. That's what we want, isn't it? More than make it great, make it live. And not from
one angle only, but in all its many bearings. Okay, we've said our prayer. We're ready to work. Now what?
The magic of making a start. This is a quote from W. H. Murray, the Scottish Himalayan expedition, quote,
Concerning all acts of initiative and creation, there is one elementary truth, the ignorance of
which kills countless ideas and splendid plans. That the moment one definitely commits oneself,
then providence moves too. All sorts of things occur to help one that would not otherwise have
occurred. A whole stream of events issues from the decision, raising in one's favor all manner of
unforeseen incidents and meetings and material assistance, which no man would have dreamed would
have come his way. I have learned a deep respect for one of Goethe's couplets, quote,
Whatever you can do or dream you can, begin it. Boldness has genius, magic, and power in it. Begin it now,
unquote. Did you ever see Wings of Desire, Wim Wender's film about angels among us?
City of Angels with Meg Ryan and Nicolas Cage was the American version. I believe it. I believe there
are angels. They're here, but we can't see them. Angels work for God. It's their job to help us,
wake us up, bump us along. Angels are agents of evolution. The Kabbalah describes angels as bundles
of light, meaning intelligence, consciousness. Kabbalists believe that above every blade of grass is an
angel crying, grow, grow. I'll go further. I believe that above the entire human race is one super angel
crying, evolve, evolve. Angels are like muses. They know stuff we don't. They want to help us. They're on
the other side of a pane of glass, shouting to get our attention. But we can't hear them. We're too
distracted by our own nonsense. Ah, but when we begin, when we make a start, when we conceive an
enterprise and commit to it in the face of our fears, something wonderful happens. A crack appears
in the membrane, like the first craze when a chick pecks at the inside of its shell. Angel midwives
congregate around us. They assist as we give birth to ourselves, to that person we were born to be,
to the one whose destiny was encoded in our soul, our demon, our genius. When we make a beginning,
we get out of our own way and allow the angels to come in and do their job. They can speak to us now,
and it makes them happy. It makes God happy. Eternity, as Blake might have told us,
has opened a portal into time, and we're it.
The magic of keeping going. When I finish a day's work, I head up into the hills for a hike.
I take a pocket tape recorder because I know that as my surface mind empties with a walk,
another part of me will chime in and start talking. Things like the word leer on page 342. It should be
ogle. Or you repeated yourself in chapter 21. The last sentence is just like the one in the middle of
chapter 7. That's the kind of stuff that comes. It comes to all of us every day, every minute.
These paragraphs I'm speaking now were dictated to me yesterday. They replace a prior, weaker opening
to this segment. I'm unspooling the new improved version now, right off the recorder.
This process of self-revision and self-correction is so common that we don't even notice. But it's a
miracle, and its implications are staggering. Who's doing this revising anyway? What force is
yanking at our sleeves? What does it tell us about the architecture of our psyches that without our
exerting effort or even thinking about it, some voice in our head pipes up to counsel us and counsel
us wisely on how to do our work and live our lives? Whose voice is it? What software is grinding away
scanning gigabytes while we, our mainstream selves, are otherwise occupied? Are these angels? Are they
muses? Is this the unconscious? The self? Whatever it is, it's smarter than we are. A lot smarter.
It doesn't need us to tell it what to do. It goes to work all by itself. It seems to want to work. It
seems to enjoy it. What exactly is it doing? It's organizing. The principle of organization is built into
nature. Chaos itself is self-organizing. Out of primordial disorder, stars find their orbits,
rivers make their way to the sea. When we, like God, set out to create a universe, a book, an opera,
a new business venture, the same principle kicks in. Our screenplay resolves itself into a three-act
structure. Our symphony takes shape into movements. Our plumbing supply venture discovers its optimum chain
of command. How do we experience this? By having ideas. Insights pop into our heads while we're shaving
or taking a shower, or even, amazingly, while we're actually working. The elves behind this are smart.
If we forget something, they remind us. If we veer off course, they trim the tabs and steer us back.
What can we conclude from this? Clearly some intelligence is at work, independent of our conscious
mind, and yet in alliance with it. Processing our material for us and alongside us. This is why artists
and entrepreneurs are modest. They know they're not doing the work themselves. They're just taking
dictation. It's also why, quote, non-creative people hate, quote, creative people. Because they're jealous.
They sense that artists and writers and entrepreneurs are tapped into some grid of energy and inspiration
that they themselves cannot connect with. Of course, this is nonsense. We're all creative.
We all have the same psyche. The same everyday miracles are happening in all our heads, day by day,
minute by minute. Okay, let's continue with a story I call Largo. In my 20s, I drove tractor trailers for
a company called Burton Lines in Durham, North Carolina. I wasn't very good at it. My self-destruction
demons had me. Only blind luck kept me from killing myself and any other poor suckers who happened to
be on the highway at the same time. It was a tough period. I was broke, estranged from my wife and my
family. One night I had this dream. I was part of the crew of an aircraft carrier. Only the ship was
stuck on dry land. It was still launching its jets and doing its thing, but it was marooned half a mile
from the ocean. The sailors all knew how screwed up the situation was. They all felt it as a keen and
constant distress. The only bright spot was there was a marine gunnery sergeant on board nicknamed Largo.
In the dream, it seemed like the coolest name anybody could possibly have. Largo. I loved it.
Largo was one of those hardcore senior non-coms like the Burt Lancaster character,
Warden, in From Here to Eternity. The one guy on the ship who knows exactly what's going on.
The tough old serge who makes all the decisions and actually runs the show.
Largo. But where was Largo? I was standing miserably by the rail when the captain came
over and started talking to me. Even he was lost. It was his ship, but he didn't know how
to get it off dry land. I was nervous finding myself in conversation with the brass and couldn't
think of a thing to say. The skipper didn't seem to notice. He just turned to me casually and said,
quote, what the hell are we gonna do, Largo? I woke up electrified. I was Largo. I was the salty old
gunny. The power to take charge was in my hands. All I had to do was believe it. Where did this dream
come from? Plainly, its intent was benevolent. What was its source? And what does it say about the
workings of the universe that such things happen at all? Again, we've all had dreams like that. Again,
they're common as dirt. So is the sunrise. That doesn't make it any less a miracle.
Before I got to North Carolina, I worked in the oil fields around Bures, Louisiana.
I lived in a bunkhouse with a bunch of other transient geeks. One guy had picked up a paperback
about meditation in a bookstore in New Orleans, and he was teaching me how to do it. I used to go out to
this dock after work and see if I could get into it. One night, this came. I was sitting cross-legged
when an eagle came and landed on my shoulders. The eagle merged with me and took off flying so
that my head became its head and my arms its wings. It felt completely authentic. I could feel the air
under my wings as solid as water feels when you row in it with an oar. It was substantial. You could
push off against it. So this was how birds flew. I realized that it was impossible for a bird to fall
out of the sky. All it would have to do is extend its wings. The solid air would hold it up with the same
power we feel when we stick our hand out the window of a moving car. I was pretty impressed with this
movie that was playing in my head, but I still had no idea what it meant. I asked the eagle, hey, what
am I supposed to be learning from this? A voice answered silently, you're supposed to learn the
things that you think are nothing, as weightless as air, are actually powerful, substantial forces,
as real and as solid as earth. I understood. The eagle was telling me that dreams, visions,
meditations such as this very one, things that I had till now disdained as fantasy and illusion,
were as real and as solid as anything in my waking life. I believed the eagle. I got the message. How
could I not? I had felt the solidness of the air. I knew he was telling the truth. Which brings us back
to the question, where did the eagle come from? Why did he show up at just the right time to tell me
just what I needed to hear? Clearly some unseen intelligence had created him, giving him form as
an eagle so that I would understand what it wanted to communicate. This intelligence was babying me
along, keeping it simple, making its point in terms so clear and elementary that even someone as
numb and asleep as I was could understand.
Now, let's look at life and death. Remember the movie Billy Jack starring Tom Laughlin?
The film and its sequels have long since decamped to cable, but Tom Laughlin is still very much around.
In addition to his movie work, he's a lecturer, an author, and a Jungian school psychologist,
whose specialty is working with people who have been diagnosed with cancer.
Tom Laughlin teaches and leads workshops. Here's a paraphrase of something I heard him say.
The moment a person learns he's got terminal cancer, a profound shift takes place in his psyche.
At one stroke in the doctor's office, he becomes aware of what really matters to him. Things that 60
seconds earlier had seemed all-important suddenly appear meaningless, while people and concerns that
he had until then dismissed had once taken on supreme importance. Maybe he realizes working this
weekend on that big deal at the office isn't all that vital. Maybe it's more important to fly cross
country for his grandson's graduation. Maybe it isn't so crucial that he have the last word in the
fight with his wife. Maybe instead he should tell her how much she means to him and how deeply he has
always loved her. Other thoughts occur to the patient diagnosed as terminal. What about that gift he had
for music? What became of the passion he once felt to work with the sick and the homeless? Why do these
unlived lives return now with such power and poignancy? Faced with our imminent extinction, Tom Laughlin
believes all assumptions are called into question. What does our life mean? Have we lived it right?
Are there vital acts we've left unperformed, crucial words unspoken? Is it too late? Tom Laughlin draws a
diagram of the psyche, a Jungian-derived model. It looks something like this. It's a large circle
called the self and inside it is a smaller circle labeled the ego. Then outside all of them is a space
called the divine ground which interpenetrates the self. The ego, Jung tells us, is that part of the
psyche that we think of as I, our conscious intelligence, our everyday brain that thinks, plans, and runs the
show of our day-to-day life. The self with a capital S as Jung defined it is a greater entity which includes the
ego but also incorporates the personal and collective unconscious. Dreams and intuitions come from the
self. The archetypes of the unconscious dwell there. It is, Jung believed, the sphere of the soul. What
happens in that instant when we learn we may soon die, Tom Laughlin contends, is that the seat of our
consciousness shifts. It moves from the ego to the self. The world is entirely new viewed from the self.
At once we discern what's really important. Superficial concerns fall away, replaced by a
deeper, more profoundly grounded perspective. This is how Tom Laughlin's foundation battles cancer.
He counsels his clients not just to make that shift mentally but to live it out in their lives.
He supports the housewife in resuming her career in social work. He urges the businessman to return to
the violin. He assists the Vietnam vet to write his novel. Miraculously, cancers go into remission.
People recover. Is it possible, Tom Laughlin asks, that the disease itself evolved as a consequence of
actions taken or not taken in our lives? Could our unlived lives have exacted their vengeance upon
us in the form of cancer? And if they did, can we cure ourselves now by living these lives out?
Next, I'd like to talk about the ego and the self. Here's what I think. I think angels make their home
in the self while resistance has its seat in the ego. The fight is between the two. The self wishes to
create, to evolve. The ego likes things just the way they are. What is the ego anyway? Since this
is my program, I'll define it my way. The ego is that part of the psyche that believes in material
existence. The ego's job is to take care of business in the real world. It's an important job. We couldn't
last a day without it. But there are worlds other than the real world, and this is where the ego runs
into trouble. Here's what the ego believes. 1. Death is real. The ego believes that our existence
is defined by our physical flesh. When the body dies, we die. There is no life beyond life. 2. Time
and space are real. The ego is analog. It believes that to get from A to Z, we have to pass through B,
C, and D. To get from breakfast to supper, we have to live the whole day. 3. Every individual is
different and separate from every other. The ego believes that I am distinct from you. The twain
cannot meet. I can hurt you, and it won't hurt me. 4. The predominant impulse of life is self-preservation.
Because our existence is physical and thus vulnerable to innumerable evils, we live and act out of fear and
all we do. It is wise, the ego believes, to have children to carry on our line when we die,
to achieve great things that will live after us, and to buckle our seat belts. 5. There is no God.
No sphere exists except the physical, and no rules apply except those of the material world.
These are the principles the ego lives by. They are sound, solid principles. Now, here's what the self
believes. 1. Death is an illusion. The soul endures and evolves through infinite manifestations.
2. Time and space are illusions. Time and space operate only in the physical sphere, and even here
don't apply to dreams, visions, transports. In other dimensions, we move swift as thought and inhabit
multiple planes simultaneously. 3. All beings are one. If I hurt you, I hurt myself. 4. The supreme emotion
is love. Union and mutual assistance are the imperatives of life. We are all in this together. 5. God is all there is.
Everything that is, is God in one form or another. God, the divine ground, is that in which we live and
move and have our being. Infinite planes of reality exist, all created by, sustained by, and infused by,
the Spirit of God. Next, I'd like to talk about experiencing the self. Have you ever wondered why the
slang terms for intoxication are so demolition oriented? Stoned, smashed, hammered? It's because
they're talking about the ego. It's the ego that gets blasted, waxed, plastered. We demolish the ego
to get to the self. The margins of the self touch upon the divine ground, meaning the mystery, the void,
the source of infinite wisdom and consciousness. Dreams come from the self. Ideas come from the self.
When we meditate, we access the self. When we fast, when we pray, when we go on a vision quest,
it's the self we're seeking. When the dervish whirls, when the yogi chants, when the sadhu mutilates
his flesh, when penitents crawl a hundred miles on their knees, when Native Americans pierce themselves
in the sun dance, when suburban kids take ecstasy and dance all night at a rave, they're seeking the
self. When we deliberately alter our consciousness in any way, we're trying to find the self. When
the alcoholic collapses in the gutter, that voice that tells him, I'll save you, comes from the self.
The self is our deepest being. The self is united to God. The self is incapable of falsehood. The self,
like the divine ground that permeates it, is ever growing and ever evolving. The self speaks for the
future. That's why the ego hates it. The ego hates the self because when we see our consciousness in
the self, we put the ego out of business. The ego doesn't want us to evolve. The ego runs the show
right now. It likes things just the way they are. The instinct that pulls us toward art is the impulse
to evolve, to learn, to heighten and elevate our consciousness. The ego hates this because the more
awake we become, the less we need the ego. The ego hates it when the awakening writer sits down at the
typewriter. The ego hates it when the aspiring painter steps up before the easel. The ego hates
it when the budding entrepreneur starts to open a venture. The ego hates it because it knows that
these souls are awakening to a call and that that call comes from a plane nobler than the material one
and from a source deeper and more powerful than the physical. The ego hates the prophet and the
visionary because they propel the race upward. The ego hated Socrates and Jesus, Luther and Galileo,
Lincoln and JFK and Martin Luther King. The ego hates artists and innovators because they are the
pathfinders and bearers of the future. Because each one dares, in James Joyce's phrase,
to forge in the smithy of my soul the uncreated conscience of my race. Such evolution is life
threatening to the ego. It reacts accordingly. It summons its cunning, marshals its troops. The ego
produces resistance and attacks the awakening artist.
Fear. Resistance feeds on fear. We experience resistance as fear. But fear of what? Fear of the
consequences of following our heart. Fear of bankruptcy. Fear of poverty. Fear of insolvency.
Fear of groveling when we try to make it on our own and groveling when we give up and come crawling
back to where we started. Fear of being selfish. Of being rotten wives or disloyal husbands. Fear of
failing to support our families. Of sacrificing their dreams for ours. Fear of betraying our race,
our hood, our homies. Fear of failure. Fear of being ridiculous. Fear of throwing away the education,
the training, the preparation that those we love have sacrificed so much for that we ourselves have
worked our butts off for. Fear of launching into the void. Of hurtling too far out there. Fear of
passing some point of no return beyond which we cannot recant, cannot reverse, cannot rescind,
but must live with this cocked up choice for the rest of our lives. Fear of madness. Fear of insanity.
Fear of death. These are serious fears. But they're not the real fear. Not the master fear. Not the mother
of all fears that's so close to us that even when we verbalize it we don't believe it. Fear that we will
succeed. That we can access the powers we secretly know we possess. That we can become the person we
sense in our hearts we truly are. This is the most terrifying prospect a human being can face because
it ejects him at one go, he imagines, from all the tribal inclusions his psyche is wired for and has been
for 50 million years. We fear discovering that we are more than we think we are. More than our parents,
children, teachers think we are. We fear that we actually possess the talent that our still small
voice tells us. That we actually have the guts, the perseverance, the capacity. We fear that we truly
can steer our ship, plant our flag, reach our promised land. We fear this because if it's true,
then we become estranged from all we know. We pass through a membrane. We become monsters and monstrous.
We know that if we embrace our ideals, we must prove worthy of them. And that scares the hell out of us.
What will become of us? We will lose our friends and family who will no longer recognize us. We will wind
up alone in the cold void of starry space with nothing and no one to hold on to. Of course, this is
exactly what happens. But here's the trick. We wind up in space, but not alone. Instead, we are tapped into an
unquenchable, undepletable, inexhaustible source of wisdom, consciousness, companionship. Yeah, we lose
friends, but we find friends, too, in places we never thought to look. And they're better friends,
truer friends, and we're better and truer to them. Do you believe me?
I'd like to talk about something now called the authentic self. Do you have kids? Then you know
that not one of them popped out as tabula rasa, a blank slate. Each came into this world with a
distinct and unique personality, an identity so set that you can fling stardust and great balls of
fire at it and not morph it by one micro dot. Every kid was who he was. Even identical twins,
constituted of the exact same genetic material, were radically different from day one and always would be.
Personally, I'm with Wordsworth, who said in his poem, Intimations of Immortality, quote,
Our birth is but a sleep and a forgetting. The soul that rises with us, our life's star,
hath elsewhere had its setting, and cometh from afar. Not in entire forgetfulness, and not in utter
nakedness, but trailing clouds of glory do we come from God, who is our home, unquote. In other words,
none of us are born as passive generic blobs waiting for the world to stamp its imprint on us.
Instead, we show up possessing already a highly refined and individuated soul. Another way of
thinking of it is this. We're not born with unlimited choices. We can't be anything we want to be.
We come into this world with a specific personal destiny. We have a job to do, a calling to enact,
a self to become. We are who we are from the cradle, and we're stuck with it. Our job in this lifetime is
not to shape ourselves into some ideal we imagine we ought to be, but to find out who we are already
and become it. If we were born to paint, it's our job to become a painter. If we were born to raise and
nurture children, it's our job to become a mother. If we were born to overthrow the order of ignorance
injustice in the world, it's our job to realize it and get down to business.
Territory versus hierarchy. In the animal kingdom, individuals define themselves in one of two ways.
By their rank within a hierarchy, a hen in a pecking order, a wolf in a pack, or by their connection to a
territory. A home base, a hunting ground, a turf. This is how individuals, humans as well as animals,
achieve psychological security. They know where they stand, the world makes sense. Of the two
orientations, the hierarchical seems to be the default setting. It's the one that kicks in automatically
when we're kids. We run naturally in packs and cliques. Without thinking about it, we know who's the
top dog and who's the underdog. And we know our own place. We define ourselves instinctively,
it seems, by our position within the schoolyard, the gang, the club. It's only later in life,
usually after a stern education in the University of Hard Knocks, that we begin to explore the
territorial alternative. For some of us, this saves our lives. Next, the hierarchical orientation.
Most of us define ourselves hierarchically and don't even know it. It's hard not to. School,
advertising, the entire materialist culture drills us from birth to define ourselves by others' opinions.
Drink this beer, get this job, look this way, and everyone will love you. What is a hierarchy,
anyway? Hollywood is a hierarchy. So are Washington, Wall Street, and the Daughters of the American
Revolution. High school is the ultimate hierarchy. And it works. And upon that small,
the hierarchical orientation succeeds. The cheerleader knows where she fits, as does the dweeb in the chess
club. Each has found a niche. The system works. There's a problem with the hierarchical orientation,
though. When the numbers get too big, the thing breaks down. A pecking order can only hold so many
chickens. In Massapeco High, you can find your place. Move to Manhattan, and the trick no longer works.
New York City is too big to function as a hierarchy. So is IBM. So is Michigan State.
The individual in multitudes this vast feels overwhelmed, anonymous. He is submerged in the
mass. He's lost. We humans seem to have been wired by our evolutionary past to function most comfortably
in a tribe of 20 to, say, 800. We can push it maybe to a few thousand, even to five figures. But at some
point it maxes out. Our brains can't file that many faces. We thrash around, flashing our badges of
status. Hey, how do you like my Lincoln Navigator? And wondering why nobody gives a damn. We have
entered mass society. The hierarchy is too big. It doesn't work anymore. Now I'd like to talk about
the artist and the hierarchy. For the artist to define himself hierarchically is fatal. Let's examine
why. First, let's look at what happens in a hierarchical orientation. An individual who defines
himself by his place in a pecking order will, one, compete against all others in the order,
seeking to elevate his station by advancing against those above him while defending his place against
those beneath. Two, evaluate his happiness, success, achievement by his rank within the hierarchy,
feeling most satisfied when he's high and most miserable when he's low. Three, act toward others
based upon their rank in the hierarchy to the exclusion of all other factors. Four, evaluate his every move
solely by the effect it produces on others. He will act for others, dress for others, speak for others,
think for others. But the artist cannot look to others to validate his efforts or his calling.
If you don't believe me, ask Van Gogh, who produced masterpiece after masterpiece and never found a
buyer his whole life. The artist must operate territorially. He must do his work for its own sake.
To labor in the arts for any reason other than love is prostitution. Recall the fate of Odysseus' men
who slew the cattle of the sun, quote, their own witlessness cast them away, the fools,
to destroy for meat the oxen of the most exalted sun, wherefore the sun god blotted out the day of
their return, unquote. In the hierarchy, the artist faces outward. Meeting someone new, he asks himself,
what can this person do for me? How can this person advance my standing? In the hierarchy,
the artist looks up and looks down. The one place he can't look is that place he must. Within.
The definition of a hack. I learned this from Robert McKee. A hack, he says, is a writer who
second guesses his audience. When the hack sits down to work, he doesn't ask himself what's in his
own heart. He asks what the market is looking for. The hack condescends to his audience. He thinks he's
superior to them. The truth is he's scared to death of them, or more accurately, scared of being authentic
in front of them. Scared of writing what he really feels or believes, but what he really thinks is
interesting. He's afraid it won't sell. So he tries to anticipate what the market, a telling word, wants,
then gives it to them. In other words, the hack writes hierarchically. He writes what he imagines
will play well in the eyes of others. He does not ask himself, what do I myself want to write? What do I
think is important? Instead, he asks, what's hot? What can I make a deal for? The hack is like the
politician who consults the polls before he takes a position. He's a demagogue. He panders. It can pay
off being a hack. Given the depraved state of American culture, a slick dude can make millions
being a hack. But even if you succeed, you lose. Because you've sold out your muse, and your muse is
you, the best part of yourself, where your finest and only true work comes from. I was starving as a
screenwriter when the idea for The Legend of Bagger Vance came to me. It came as a book, not a movie.
I met with my agent to give him the bad news. We both knew that first novels take forever and sell
for nothing. Worse, a novel about golf, even if we could find a publisher, is a straight shot to the
remainder bin. But the muse had me. I had to do it. To my amazement, the book succeeded critically
and commercially better than anything I'd ever done, and others since have been lucky too. Why?
My best guess is this. I trusted what I wanted, not what I thought would work. I did what I myself
thought was interesting and left its reception to the gods. The artist can't do his work
hierarchically. He has to work territorially.
The Territorial Orientation
There's a three-legged coyote who lives up the hill from me. All the garbage cans in the
neighborhood belong to him. It's his territory. Every now and then, some four-legged intruder tries to
take over. They can't do it. On his home turf, even a peg-legged critter is invincible. We humans have
territories too. Ours are psychological. Stevie Wonder's territory is the piano. Arnold Schwarzenegger's is the
gym. When Bill Gates pulls into the parking lot at Microsoft, he's on his territory. When I sit down to
write, I'm on mine. Now, what are the qualities of a territory? One, a territory provides sustenance.
Runners know what a territory is. So do rock climbers and kayakers and yogis. Artists and
entrepreneurs know what a territory is. The swimmer who towels off after finishing her laps feels a
hell of a lot better than the tired, cranky person who dove into the pool 30 minutes earlier.
Two, a territory sustains us without any external input. A territory is a closed feedback loop.
Our role is to put in effort and love. The territory absorbs us and gives it back to us in the form of
well-being. When experts tell us that exercise, or any other effort requiring activity, banishes
depression, this is what they mean. Three, a territory can only be claimed alone.
You can team with a partner, you can work out with a friend, but you only need yourself to soak
up your territory's juice. Four, a territory can only be claimed by work. When Arnold Schwarzenegger
hits the gym, he's on his own turf. But what made it his own are the hours and years of sweat he put
in to claim it. A territory doesn't give, it gives back. And five, a territory returns exactly what you
put in. Territories are fair. Every erg of energy you put in goes infallibly into your account. A
territory never devalues. A territory never crashes. What you deposited, you get back dollar for dollar.
What's your territory? The artist and the territory. The act of creation is by definition
territorial. As the mother-to-be bears her child within her, so the artist or innovator contains her
new life. No one can help her give it birth, but neither does she need any help. The mother and the
artist are watched over by heaven. Nature's wisdom knows when it's time for the life within to switch
from gills to lungs. It knows down to the nanosecond when the first tiny fingernails may appear.
When the artist acts hierarchically, she short-circuits the muse. She insults her and pisses her off.
The artist and the mother are vehicles, not originators. They don't create new life. They
only bear it. This is why birth is such a humbling experience. The new mom weeps in awe at the little
miracle in her arms. She knows it came out of her, but not from her. Through her, but not of her.
When the artist or innovator works territorially, she reveres heaven. She aligns herself with the
mysterious forces that power the universe and that seek through her to bring forth new life. By doing
her work for its own sake, she sets herself at the service of these forces. Remember, as artists and
innovators, we don't know diddly. We're winging it every day. For us to try to second-guess our muse the
way a hack second guesses his audience is condescension to heaven. It's blasphemy and sacrilege. Instead,
let's ask ourselves like that new mother, what do I feel growing inside me? Let me bring that forth,
if I can, for its own sake and not for what it can do for me or how it can advance my standing.
Here's the difference between territory and hierarchy. How can we tell if our orientation is
territorial or hierarchical? One way is to ask ourselves, if I were feeling really anxious,
what would I do? If we would pick up the phone and call six friends, one after the other, with the aim
of hearing their voices and reassuring ourselves that they still love us, we're operating hierarchically.
We're seeking the good opinion of others. What would Arnold Schwarzenegger do on a freaky day?
He wouldn't phone his buddies. He'd head for the gym. He wouldn't care if the place was empty,
if he didn't say a word to his soul. He knows that working out all by itself is enough to bring him
back to his center. His orientation is territorial. Here's another test. Of any activity you do,
ask yourself, if I were the last person on earth, would I still do it? If you're all alone on the planet,
a hierarchical orientation makes no sense. There's no one to impress. So if you'd still pursue that
activity, congratulations, you're doing it territorially. If Arnold Schwarzenegger were the
last man on earth, he'd still go to the gym. Stevie Wonder would still pound the piano. The sustenance
they get comes from the act itself, not from the impression it makes on others. I have a friend who's
nuts for clothes. If she were the last woman on earth, she would shoot straight to Givenchy or Saint-Laurent,
smash her way in and start pillaging. In her case, it wouldn't be to impress others.
She just loves clothes. That's her territory. Now, what about ourselves as artists,
innovators, and entrepreneurs? How do we do our work, hierarchically or territorially?
If we were freaked out, would we go there first? If we were the last person on earth,
would we still show up at the studio, the rehearsal hall, the laboratory?
The Supreme Virtue
Someone once asked the Spartan King Leonidas to identify the supreme warrior virtue
from which all others derived. He replied, contempt for death. For us as artists and entrepreneurs,
here in that statement, failure, contempt for failure is our cardinal virtue. By confining our
attention territorially to our own thoughts and actions, in other words, to the work and its demands,
we cut the earth from beneath the blue-painted, shield-banging, spear-brandishing foe.
The Fruits of Our Labor When Krishna instructed Arjuna
that we have a right to our labor but not to the fruits of our labor, he was counseling the warrior
to act territorially, not hierarchically. We must do our work for its own sake, not for fortune or
attention or applause. Then there's the third way proffered by the Lord of Discipline, which is beyond
both hierarchy and territory. That is to do the work and give it to him. Do it as an offering to God.
Here's the quote from the Bhagavad Gita.
Give the act to me, purged of hope and ego, fix your attention on the soul, act and do for me.
The work comes from heaven anyway, why not give it back? To labor in this way, the Bhagavad Gita tells us,
is a form of meditation and a supreme species of spiritual devotion. It also, I believe, conforms
most closely to higher reality. In fact, we are servants of the mystery. We were put here on earth
to act as agents of the infinite, to bring into existence that which is not yet but which will be
through us. Every breath we take, every heartbeat, every evolution of every cell, comes from God and
is sustained by God every second, just as every creation, invention, every bar of music or line of
verse, every thought, vision, fantasy, every dumbass flop and stroke of genius comes from that infinite
intelligence that created us and the universe in all its dimensions, out of the void, the field of
infinite potential, primal chaos, the muse. To acknowledge that reality, to efface all ego,
to let the work come through us and give it back freely to its source, that, in my opinion,
is as true to reality as it gets. Portrait of the Artist
In the end, we arrive at a kind of model of the artist's world or the entrepreneur's world,
and that model is that there exist other, higher planes of reality about which we can prove nothing,
but from which arise our lives, our work, and our art. These spheres are trying to communicate with
ours. When Blake said eternity is in love with creations of time, he was referring to those
planes of pure potential which are timeless, placeless, spaceless, but which long to bring
their visions into being here, in this time-bound, space-defined world. The artist and the innovator
are the servants of that intention, of those angels, of that muse. The enemy of the artist and the
innovator is the small-time ego, which begets resistance, which is the dragon that guards the gold.
That's why an artist or an innovator must be a warrior, and like all warriors, artists and innovators
over time acquire modesty and humility. They may, some of them, conduct themselves flamboyantly in
public. But alone with the work, they are chaste and humble. They know they are not the source of
the creations they bring into being. They only facilitate. They carry. They are the willing
and skilled instruments of the gods and goddesses they serve.
And finally, the artist's life. Are you a born writer? Were you put on earth to be a painter,
a scientist, an apostle of peace? In the end, the question can only be answered by action.
Do it, or don't do it. It may help to think of it this way. If you were meant to cure cancer,
or write a symphony, or crack cold fusion, and you don't do it, you not only hurt yourself,
even destroy yourself, you hurt your children, you hurt me, you hurt the planet. You shame the
angels who watch over you, and you spite the almighty who created you and only you with your
unique gifts for the sole purpose of nudging the human race one millimeter farther along its path
back to God. Creative work is not a selfish act or a bid for attention on the part of the actor.
It's a gift to the world and every being in it. Don't cheat us of your contribution.
Give us what you've got.
