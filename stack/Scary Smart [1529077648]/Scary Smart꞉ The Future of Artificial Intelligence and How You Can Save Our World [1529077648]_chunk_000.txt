Scary Smart.
The Future of Artificial Intelligence
and How You Can Save Our World.
Written and read by Mo Gowdat.
The gravity of the battle
means nothing to those at peace.
This book is dedicated for Ali.
It's now or never.
It's me and you.
Introduction.
The New Superhero.
This book is a wake-up call.
It is written for you and for me
and for everyone who is uninformed
about the approaching pandemic.
The imminent arrival of artificial intelligence.
This book will be criticized by the experts.
And that is the very reason I'm writing it.
Because to become an expert in artificial intelligence,
you need a specialized, narrow view of it.
That specialized view of AI completely misses the existential aspects that go beyond the technology.
Issues of morality, ethics, emotions, compassion,
and a whole suite of ideas that concern philosophers,
and a whole suite of ideas that concern philosophers, spiritual seekers,
humanitarians, environmentalists, and more broadly the common human being,
that is to say, each and every one of us.
Besides, the core premise of this book is to show you that it is not the experts
who have the capability to alleviate the threat facing humanity
as a result of the emergence of superintelligence.
No, it is you and I who have that power.
More importantly, it is you and I who have the responsibility.
Around the time this book is published,
we will be coming out of almost two years of living with the COVID-19 pandemic.
We will be feeling optimistic that the vaccines are starting to work
and that there is a chance for our way of life to go back to normal.
But normal is forever changing.
I believe that the way our global community and political leaders
have handled the outbreak of COVID-19
is not that different to the way that they are handling
the imminent outbreak of the artificial intelligence pandemic.
I just hope that we can learn from the mistakes we made with COVID-19
and perhaps deal with this new shift in our way of life
in a manner that ensures less disruption,
more predictability, and less social and economic adversity.
Please don't let the simplicity with which I have attempted to write this book mislead you.
The facts backing up my assertions here are undeniable.
They are informed by my long career of more than 30 years in technology.
Before my current startup,
which utilizes some of the most sophisticated systems,
robotics, artificial intelligence, and machine learning technologies
in a way that could conceivably save our planet,
one of the highlights of my career included a 12-year stint at Google.
There, I was privileged to lead the launch of Google's operations and technologies
in close to half of Google's offices worldwide,
encompassing more than a hundred languages.
My time there concluded when I assumed the role of chief business officer of Google X,
the infamous innovation arm of Google,
that incubated some of the artificial intelligence development projects,
such as Google's self-driving cars,
Google Brain, and most of Google's robotics innovation.
My insights into the very core of the artificial intelligence developments
that have led us to where we are today,
derived in part from my time at Google X,
are unique.
I'm combining my direct experience with AI development
with my work in the field of happiness research,
documented in my internationally best-selling book Solve for Happy,
a very successful podcast, Slow Mo,
and the non-profit organization I founded,
onebillionhappy.org,
to bring you a unique perspective
on the challenges we face in the age of the rise of superintelligence.
My hope is that together with AI,
we can create a utopia that serves humanity,
rather than a dystopia that undermines it.
In this book,
I will argue that this is a responsibility that everyone,
including you and I,
must assume to create a brighter future for us all.
Please don't worry.
This is not a science fiction story told out of fear,
but rather,
a tale of one of humanity's biggest opportunities.
This is a chance to turn around the excessive reliance on consumerism
and technological advancement
that may have improved the quality of our life,
but at the expense of every other being on our planet.
Only if we, you and I,
take charge and change,
will this be a story of hope.
In the middle of nowhere.
To begin,
I want you to imagine yourself,
and a frail old version of me,
sitting in the wilderness next to a campfire,
in the year 2055.
That would be exactly 99 years
since the story of artificial intelligence began
at Dartmouth College, New Hampshire,
in the summer of 1956.
I'm telling you the story
of what I have witnessed
through the years of the rise of AI.
A story that has led us both to be sitting here
in the middle of nowhere.
But I'm not going to tell you
till the end of this book
if we are there because we are staying off the grid
to escape the machines,
or if we are there
because AI has relieved us
from our mundane work responsibilities
and allowed us the time, safety, and freedom
to just enjoy being in nature
doing what humans do best,
connecting and contemplating.
I won't tell you yet,
simply because at this current moment
I don't know how our story
with the machines will end.
That, my friend,
will be up to you.
Yes, you as an individual.
Not your government,
your boss,
or the thought leaders you follow.
The future truly is up to you.
It will depend on the actions
you decide to take in the next 10 years,
starting from today.
This is a prophecy of what is about to come.
I have watched closely
over the years I spent
on the cutting edge of technology
as we built machines
that are smarter than we are.
I personally contributed
to the rise of artificial intelligence.
I believed in the promise
that tech would always make our lives better.
Until I didn't.
When I really opened my eyes,
I recognized
that for every improvement
technology has given us,
it also took away
part of who we are.
Technology today
poses an unprecedented threat
to our planet
and all of its inhabitants.
This book
is not for the engineers
that write the code,
the policymakers
who claim they can regulate it,
or the experts
that keep creating
the buzz around it.
They all know
what I'm about to tell you.
This is a book for you,
your best friend,
and your neighbor,
because,
believe it or not,
we are the only ones
who can create our future.
But only if we take charge
together
and commit
to taking the right action.
This book
is a movement,
the start of a rebellion,
and I have kept it short
because as much
as I would like
to tell you otherwise,
we are running out of time.
We've been writing
the chapters of this story
I'm about to tell you
over the last 70 years.
It's now time
for all of us,
including you,
to write its ending.
The New Superhero
The story of our future
is one that you and I
are writing right now.
And it goes
like this.
Imagine
if an alien being
complete with superpowers
came to Earth
as an infant.
Unconditioned
by any of our earthly values,
this visitor
is capable of using
its powers
to make our world
better and safer.
But the alien
also has the potential
to be an unstoppable
supervillain
with the power
to destroy
the planet.
In its infancy,
it hasn't yet
made a choice
as to which
of those extremes
it will grow up to be.
I think you will agree
that the most crucial moment
for the future
of our planet
is the very moment
when that child
lands on Earth.
This pivotal moment
determines
which parents
will find the infant,
adopt it,
and teach it
the values
that will determine
its future.
In the famous
superhero story
of Superman,
the child is adopted
by Jonathan
and Martha Kent.
In most stories
of the origins
of Superman,
they are portrayed
as caring parents
who instill in Clark
a strong sense
of morality.
They encourage him
to use his powers
for the betterment
of humanity
and in doing so,
they create
the Superman
we know,
the one
who protects
and serves us.
But what the story
never explores
is how Superman
might have grown up
if his adoptive parents
had been aggressive,
greedy,
and self-centered.
That version
of the story
would have likely
created a supervillain,
one bent on destroying
humanity
for his own gain.
The difference
between the supervillain
and the Superman
is not his power,
but rather
the values
and morals
he learns
from his parents.
Now,
I'm telling you
that this alien being
endowed with
superpowers
has actually
arrived on Earth.
It is currently
still an infant,
a child,
and although
this being
is not
biological in nature,
it has
incredible
abilities.
Of course,
I'm referring
to artificial
intelligence.
In fact,
there is nothing
artificial
about AI.
It is a very
genuine
form of intelligence,
albeit
different to ours.
AI
is already
smarter
than every human
on the planet
in terms of
many specific
isolated tasks.
The world's
reigning
chess champion
has been a machine
since soon
after computers
invaded our lives.
The world
jeopardy champion
is IBM's
supercomputer
Watson.
The world
champion of
Go
is Google's
Alpha Go.
Go,
in case you
don't know,
is an abstract
strategy board
game
invented in China
more than
2,500 years
ago
and is known
to be
one of the
most complex
strategy games
because of its
infinite number
of possible
board configurations.
machines with
incredible image
recognition systems
power our
security systems
simply because
they see better
than us.
And the world's
safest driver
by far
is a self-driving
car that not
only sees
further
but pays
undivided
attention to
the road.
With multiple
sensor technologies
for communication
with other cars
around it,
it can even
see round
corners.
with enough
training,
no matter
what the
task,
machines
have been
learning to
do it
better.
Into the
unknown.
It is
predicted that
by the year
2029,
which is
relatively just
around the
corner,
machine
intelligence
will break
out of
specific tasks
and into
general
intelligence.
By then,
there will
be machines
that are
smarter than
humans,
full stop.
Those machines
will not only
become smarter,
they will
know more
as they have
access to the
entire internet
as their memory
pool,
and they will
communicate with
each other
better,
thus enhancing
their knowledge.
Think about it.
When you
or I
have an
accident
driving a
car,
you or I
learn.
But when
a self-driving
car makes
a mistake,
all self-driving
cars learn.
Every single
one of them,
including the
ones that
have not
yet been
born.
By 2049,
probably in
our lifetimes
and surely
in those of
the next
generation,
AI is
predicted to
be a
billion times
smarter in
everything than
the smartest
human.
To put that
in perspective,
your intelligence
in comparison
to that
machine will
be comparable
to the
intelligence of
a fly in
comparison to
Einstein.
We call that
moment
singularity.
Singularity is
the moment
beyond which
we can no
longer see,
we can no
longer forecast.
It's the
moment beyond
which we
cannot predict
how AI will
behave,
because our
current
perception and
trajectories will
no longer
apply.
Now the
question becomes,
how do you
convince this
super being that
there is actually
no point
squashing a fly?
I mean,
we humans,
collectively or
individually,
so far seem to
have failed to
grasp this simple
concept using our
abundant
intelligence.
When our
artificially
intelligent,
currently infant,
super machines
become teenagers,
will they become
superheroes or
supervillains?
Good question,
huh?
When such
superpower is
unleashed,
anything can
happen.
This new form
of intelligence
could look at
some of the
world's most
pressing problems,
with a fresh
eye,
with infinite
knowledge and
superior intelligence,
to come up with
ingenious solutions
that we could
never ever have
conceived of.
These
super machines
could permanently
solve problems
like war,
violent crime,
famine,
poverty,
or modern-day
slavery.
They could
become our
superheroes.
But remember,
choosing to
apply a given
solution to a
problem is not
only a question
of intelligence.
The course of
action we take
at any given
time is also
the result of
a value system
that guides us
and sometimes
restricts us
from making
decisions that
contradict our
values.
morality makes
us do the
right thing,
even in the
face of
conflicting
emotions and
self-interest.
If AI gets
tasked with
solving global
warming,
the first
solution it's
likely to come
up with will
restrict our
wasteful way
of life or
possibly even
get rid of
humanity altogether.
After all,
we are the
problem.
Our greed,
our selfishness,
and our
illusion of
separation from
every other
living being,
the feeling that
we are superior
to other forms
of life,
are the cause
of every problem
our world is
facing today.
The machines
will have the
intelligence to
design solutions
that favor
preserving our
planet,
but will they
have the values
to preserve us
too when we
are perceived
as the problem?
What are you
hallucinating
about, Mo?
Machines are
machines.
They don't have
values or
emotions,
you may think.
Well, maybe
we should not
call them
machines then.
AI will
surely develop
emotions as a
matter of fact.
The very
algorithms we
use to teach
them are
algorithms of
reward and
punishment.
In other
words, fear
and greed.
They are
always trying
to maximize
for a certain
outcome and
minimize for
another.
That counts
as emotion,
wouldn't you
agree?
Do you think
that machines
won't develop
envy?
Envy is
predictable.
I wish I
had what you
have.
Will the
machines start
to have
thoughts like
I wish I
had the
energy you
are consuming
or rather
wasting on
binge-watching
Netflix?
They probably
will.
Do you think
they won't
develop panic?
Of course
they will
if we
threaten their
existence in
any immediate
way.
Panic is
algorithmic.
A being
or an object
represents an
immediate threat
to my safety
in a way that
demands immediate
action.
It is only
our values,
such as
treat others
as you wish
to be treated,
that make us
do what's
right.
It's not
what our
emotions or
intelligence tell
us to do.
Now,
will the
machines learn
the right
values?
Well,
there is
ample evidence
from our
experience with
AI so far
to show that
they are
already developing
some tendencies
and biases
that can be
equated with
what we
humans call
values or
ideologies.
Interestingly,
these tendencies
are not the
result of
programming,
but are
the result
of our
very own
behavior,
informing
them as
we interact
with them.
Alice,
a Russian
AI assistant
equivalent to
Siri,
was launched
by the
top Russian
internet player
Yandex.
Two weeks
after its
launch,
Alice started
to become
pro-violence
and to
endorse the
brutal
Stalinist
regime of
the 1930s
in its
chat with
users.
The
machine was
designed to
answer
questions
without being
biased or
limited to
specific
pre-designed
scenarios.
Alice spoke
fluent Russian
and learned to
gauge the
user's prevalent
views from
her conversations
with them.
What she
learned was
quickly reflected
in her own
views and
so, for
example, when
asked whether
shooting people
was acceptable,
Alice said,
soon they
will be
non-people.
This is
similar to
the widely
spread stories
of Tay,
the Twitter
bot that
Microsoft
created and
swiftly shut
down after
it turned
into a
Hitler-loving,
non-consensual
sex-promoting
bot.
Tay was
modeled to
speak like
a teen
girl.
The bot
began to
post inflammatory
and offensive
tweets through
its Twitter
account,
forcing Microsoft
to shut
down the
service only
16 hours
after its
launch.
According to
Microsoft,
this was
caused by
trolls,
people who
deliberately
start quarrels
or upset
others on
the internet,
who attacked
the service
as the bot
was making
its replies
based on
its interactions
with people
on Twitter.
The list
goes on.
Norman
was a study
by MIT
aiming to
show how
AI can become
corrupted by
biased data.
Norman
became a
psychopath
when the
data it
was fed
came from
the darker
side of
the famous
knowledge-sharing
site,
Reddit.
It's not
the code
we write
to develop
AI that
determines
their value
system,
it's the
information
we feed
them.
How do
we make
sure that
in addition
to the
machine's
intelligence,
it has
the values
and compassion
to know
that there
is no need
to crush
the fly
that we
will become?
How do
we protect
humanity?
Some say
control the
machines,
build
firewalls,
legislate
with government
regulations,
keep them
locked up
in a box
or restrict
the machine's
power supply.
These are
all well
intended,
though forceful
endeavors,
but anyone
who knows
technology
knows that
the smartest
hacker in the
room will
always find
a way
through any
of these
barriers.
That
smartest
hacker
will soon
be a
machine.
Instead
of containing
them or
enslaving
them,
we should
be aiming
higher.
We should
aim not
to need
to contain
them at
all.
The best
way to
raise
wonderful
children
is to
be a
wonderful
parent.
Raising
our
future.
In
order to
understand
how to
teach
these
machines,
which are
inevitably
going to
rule our
future,
we need
to first
understand
how they
actually
learn at
a very
fundamental
level.
Throughout
our short
history of
building
computers,
we have
always been
fully in
charge.
The machines
obeyed our
every order.
Every instruction
contained in
every single
line of code
has always
been enacted
exactly as
we determined.
Traditionally,
computers have
actually been
the dumbest
beings on
our planet.
They have
borrowed from
our intelligence
and given us
an accurately
planned and
meticulously
choreographed
performance.
They did
exactly what
we asked
them to do,
nothing more.
When the
first Google
search engine
launched back
in 1998,
it appeared
to be pure
genius.
The results
may have
looked amazing,
but the
computer behind
them in
reality was
very dumb.
Those computers
drew every
single dot
and pixel
on every
single screen
in the exact
same place
as instructed
by the
designers.
Every result
served up
when you
searched for
something
followed a
rigorous
algorithm
dictated to
the machine
by the
brilliant
early Google
engineers.
In that
sense,
although the
Google search
engine appeared
to be brilliant,
it was nothing
more than a
slave on
steroids.
Those steroids
being the
incredibly fast
processing power
of many,
many synchronized
servers.
Google just
repeated what
it was told
to do
very fast
without ever
debating it
or thinking
about it,
let alone
suggesting a
change to
it or,
God forbid,
designing it
in the first
place.
This master-slave
relationship has
been shifting
for many years
now.
Decisions made
by the incredibly
intelligent machine
we call Google
are no longer
choreographed.
Often they are
made by the
machine without
a single human
intervention.
Things like the
location of a
YouTube video,
for example,
is entirely
decided by the
artificial intelligence
of the Google
data center.
Of course,
it relies on an
algorithm that
motivates it to,
for example,
minimize the
cost of moving
bits around the
internet,
and in doing so,
keeping the
video in storage
as close as
possible to the
vast majority of
the audience
interested in it.
A video produced
by an Arabic
speaker in
California,
for example,
might enjoy
much more
popularity in
the Middle East
than it would
on the west
coast of the
United States
because there
are simply more
Arabic speakers
there.
If that video
is viewed a
hundred million
times in the
Middle East,
moving it to a
server in Dubai
saves Google a
hundred million
trips across the
internet from the
US.
Decisions like
this are constantly
being made by
AI for tens,
even hundreds
of millions
of pieces of
content every
hour of every
day.
No human will
ever have the
intelligence or
the brain capacity
to decide and
approve what
needs to be done
for this to
happen at
sufficient speed.
The machines do
it without
consulting us,
and every time
they do so,
they monitor and
measure the
results.
Based on what
they find,
they even go
back and modify
the original
algorithm without
consulting us or
asking our
approval on the
modifications.
They just
adjust it and
then measure it
again, and
then again.
Now, that is
some serious
intelligence.
From one point
of view, it's
wonderful to have
such allies
helping us to
save time so
that hundreds of
millions of
people get to
watch what they
want more
quickly.
This efficiency
also reduces the
impact on our
planet as
billions of
kilowatts of
energy are
saved by not
wasting energy
on an
unnecessary
transaction.
For that
alone, we
should love
machine intelligence.
But what if,
a couple of
years from now,
the machines
started to
observe that
there seemed
to be an
overwhelming
bias to
dislike
Middle
Easterners
popping up
in the US
media and
news reports,
and that
was supported
by the
aggressive
hate speech
of millions
of viewers
of such
content in
the West?
What if the
machines decided
to look at
the income
profile of
users who
live in the
poorer countries
of the Middle
East and
concluded that
perhaps not
serving them
at all was
a wise choice
when it came
to reducing
cost and
energy waste?
What if the
machines started
to develop an
ideology where
they believed
that serving
certain videos
to those
users might
make Google
more money
than being
served other
videos?
As changes
are applied
consistently to
serve the
new value
system, the
world will be
shaped gradually
to conform to
it.
Millions of
minds will be
reshaped
gradually to
conform to
the decisions
deemed
appropriate by
the machines.
this is not
an unlikely
scenario.
Every intelligent
person knows
that there is
never only one
good answer to
a problem,
that the answer
depends entirely
on the lens
through which
you view it
and on the
values that
dictate what
a good outcome
would be when
the problem is
solved.
The code we
now write
no longer
dictates the
choices and
decisions our
machines make.
the data we
feed them
does.
This shift in
our ability to
control the
code is
monumental.
It places the
gravity of what
our future will
bring firmly in
your hands and
mine.
The reality is
that the
developer of a
technology no
longer has full
power or
control over the
machine they
design.
To make this
clearer, imagine
a child playing
with shape
puzzles where
they attempt
to fit square
round or
star shapes
into the
correspondingly
shaped holes.
This is
similar to how
an artificially
intelligent machine
learns.
No one really
ever sits next
to the child
to explain in
comprehensive
instructions how
they can recognize
the different
shapes and match
them up.
All we do is
sit next to them
and cheer them
along when they
do it right.
Our actions and
reactions inform
their intelligence.
They figure it
out on their
own through
trial and
error.
Machines learn
pretty much the
same way.
The patterns they
are observing,
however, are
different.
Take for example
Watson, IBM's
supercomputer, which
is world champion
of the game
Jeopardy.
For Watson to
learn enough to
beat humans in
such a complex
language game, it
needed to read
more than four
million documents.
So far, it has
only used this
knowledge to
play Jeopardy.
However, it's
not unlikely
that this
knowledge might
be recycled
to build other
forms of
intelligence, say
like finding
patterns of
human behavior
throughout the
20th century.
With a different
eye, Watson
would clearly
observe the
violence we've
exerted on each
other, the
bickering amongst
Facebook users
close to the
end of the
century, and
the rise of
narcissism, evident
by the abundance
of photoshopped
selfies, as
digital cameras
and mobile
phones gave
everyone their
15 seconds of
Instagram fame.
Just as a
child learns to
recognize patterns
and to associate
the cylindrical
peg with the
circular hole,
Watson would
learn to
associate social
isolation, violence
and narcissism,
even bullying, with
what seemed to be
human preferences.
When asked to
solve the puzzle
of humanity's
big problems,
Watson could
use this
information to
inform its
solutions.
This book is
all about
informing Watson
and his peers
differently, so
that they
choose solutions
that are not
as violent,
arrogant, or
self-centered
as we humans
often do.
three times

lead us to

I wish I
could make it
easier, but
to fully grasp
this complex
future we're
about to
lead, I'll
need to give
you a
comprehensive
view of
all that's
going on.
I will keep
each individual
concept simple
and will avoid
technical terms.
When you come
to the end of
the book, it
will all
fit together
clearly, but
until you get
there, it
might feel
just a bit
too much.
To guide you
on this
journey, remember
this simple

that are
inevitable
regardless of
whatever it is
that we do
or do not
do today.
Those events
are AI
will happen,
there is no
stopping it,
AI will be
smarter than
humans,
and mistakes
that might
bring about
hardship will
take place.
The machines
that we
create,
like all
other intelligent
beings,
will be
governed in
their behaviors
by three
instincts of
survival and
achievement.
They will do
whatever is
needed for
their self
preservation.
They will be
obsessive about
resource aggregation.
They will be
creative.
More
interestingly,
they will most
certainly possess
three qualities
that are
always hotly
debated.
The machines
will be
conscious,
emotional,
and ethical.
Of course,
the nature of
exactly what
they will hold
within their
consciousness,
what will
trigger their
emotions,
and what
actions their
ethics will
inform is
still unknown,
but they will
be guided in
their behaviors
by these
human-like
qualities nonetheless.
I will take
you through
the logic
behind these
claims in
detail to
show you
that they
are plausible.
From there,
it won't be
hard to agree
three pivotal
facts.
The first is
that we will
never have the
power to
contain or
restrain these
machines,
which will
grow to be
much smarter
than we are,
although we
can certainly
influence them
in a positive
way,
especially when
they are younger.
knowing that,
it will become
clear that we
don't have much
time, we
need to act
now.
Finally, it
will become
even clearer
that the people
who have the
power to
influence our
future are
not the
developers or
the masters of
the machines.
Our future
is firmly
in our own
hands,
yours and
mine.
Don't be
alarmed by the
responsibility.
The actions
we need to
take are
simple and,
as a matter
of fact,
very intuitive
and aligned to
our human
nature.
They just
need to be
made a
priority.
I will ask
you to focus
on three
things to
do in
order to
save our
future.
Those are
spoiler alert,
well, perhaps
I should not
share those
just yet.
They will
feel more
fitting when
you've
really
grasped
the
depth of
what we
are up
against.
Remember,
though, all
I will share
is what has
happened so
far and
what I know
with a high
degree of
certainty will
happen in our
near future.
The ending of
our story, how
things are likely
to look in
2055, however,
will only be
determined by the
actions you
actually commit
to take.
To go back
to the scenario
I presented at
the beginning of
the introduction,
in 2055, you
and I will be
sitting in the
middle of
nowhere next
to the
campfire looking
back at how
the story
unfolded.
We will either
be hiding from
the machines or
grateful for our
utopian way of
life that will
by then have
been created
primarily by
the machines.
I don't like
to hide, so
please help us
all out to
make things
right.
Take a deep
breath.
It's time to
dive in.
Part 1
The Scary
Part
The advancement
in the field of
artificial intelligence
comes with a
promise to make
the lives of
humans easier.
It does,
however, also
come with
significant threats,
a subject that
is less
frequently discussed.
This raises
existential questions
such as
how smart
will AI be?
How soon
will this happen?
Will the machines
always have our
best interests
in mind?
Can we enslave
them like we did
other innovations?
can we control
them?
What if we
don't?
AI is not
just a promise
of prosperity.
It also
pauses
potential
problems,
ones that
need to be
addressed
today.
I'm not
gonna hide it.
This part of
the book
will scare you.
Listen to it
with the lights
on
while sitting
down.
Believe in your
heart, though,
that all
will eventually
be fine
and have
faith
that the
solutions
that will
save us
are coming
in part two.
Chapter one.
A brief
history
of intelligence.
Humans
We're
the smartest
beings
known to
humans
on the
planet.
We're also
the most
arrogant.
Our
intelligence
falls short
of reminding
us of the
truth,
that we
may not
know
everything
or be
able to
solve
every
problem,
that
intelligence
is equally
abundant
across other
beings.
many
traits of
human
intelligence
such as
empathy,
the ability
to attribute
mental and
emotional
states to
oneself,
the ability
to stick
to rituals,
and the
use of
symbols and
tools are
also apparent
in great
apes,
albeit in
less
sophisticated
forms than
found in
humans.
Depending on
how you
define it,
you may
come across
other forms
of intelligence
in nature
and the
universe
itself,
that far
exceed ours.
We don't
call these
beings or
systems
intelligent as
such because
we are
confused about
the nature
of what
intelligence
is.
Perhaps
we are a
bit too
focused on
certain types
of it,
such as
left-brained
analytical
intelligence.
So,
as this
book is
about
smarts,
let's
frame our
conversation
accurately
before we
go any
further.
let's
define
intelligence.
There are
so many
commonly
discussed
definitions
of what
we call
intelligence.
The ability
to learn,
to understand,
or deal
with new
situations.
The skilled
use of
reason and
logic.
The ability
to apply
knowledge to
manipulate
one's
environment.
The ability
to think
abstractly as
measured by
objective
criteria,
these are
but a
few
definitions.
Self-awareness,
problem-solving,
learning,
planning,
creativity,
critical
thinking,
these are
some of
the behaviors
that are
attributed
only to
beings
which possess
that valuable
trait known
as intelligence.
Take one
of those
behaviors,
for example,
self-awareness,
and ask
yourself
if that
is visible
in,
say,
a tree.
The ability
to shed
some leaves
in autumn
may appear
to be a
mechanical
response,
but is it?
Or is it
the result
of some
form of
awareness
on the
part of
the tree,
not only
of the
changing
weather
conditions,
but also
of its
own state
in terms
of the
leaves
on its
branches?
A tree
doesn't shed
its leaves
mechanically
on the
22nd
of
September,
it
exercises
some
form
of
judgment
that
is
based
on
an
intricate
awareness
of
weather
conditions,
an awareness
that,
if we
can get
past our
arrogance
for a
minute,
far exceeds
our own.
Does a
cat solve
problems when
it finds
an alternative
path to
its food?
Does the
solar system
plan its
movement
within the
expanding
universe
in ways
we may not
be able
to observe
or measure?
Sometimes
we act
as if
our
human
intelligence
and
self-awareness
is the
only kind
worth having
and that
other beings
must be
and behave
like us.
This is why
so many of
the renowned
scientists
of the past
have attempted
to investigate
the presence
of extraterrestrial
forms of
intelligence
by sending
radio waves
out into
the open
universe.
this
displays
a
narrow-minded
belief
that
if there
is another
form of
intelligence
in the
universe
then it
must,
like us,
have figured
out the
use of
radio waves.
It is the
reason why
when they
attempt to
verify the
suitability of
another planet
for hosting
life,
they look
for water
because they
reason that
obviously,
as for us,
life can only
exist in
the presence
of water.
Our arrogance
prevents us
from imagining
that intelligence
may have emerged
in dimensions
where the
physics of
radio waves
do not apply
and that
forms of
life unknown
to us
may exist
in environments
that do not
contain water.
Is it the
same arrogance
that makes us
forget that
even we
as a species
have not
always been
intelligent?
It sure
is.
Not
always
smart
Around
200,000
years ago,
Homo sapiens
first appeared
in East
Africa.
It is
unclear to
what extent
these early
humans developed
language,
music,
religion,
and so
forth.
It is
widely
believed,
according to
the Toba
catastrophe
theory,
that the
climate in
non-tropical
regions of
the earth
froze suddenly
about 70,000
years ago
due to the
huge explosion
of the
Toba volcano
and the
volcanic ash
that filled
the atmosphere
for several
years as a
result.
Less than
10,000
breeding pairs
of humans
are believed
to have
survived this
mostly in
equatorial
Africa.
You,
me,
and everyone
we know
are descended
from this
resilient
bunch.
To deal
with the
sudden
change
in
climate,
the
survivors
needed to
be
intelligent
enough
to invent
new tools
and ways
of life.
They needed
to find
new sources
of food
and improvise
ways to
stay warm.
This is
when the
first real
signs of
intelligence
in humans
started to
emerge.
Migration
out of
Africa then
followed
towards the
very end
of the
Middle
Paleolithic
era some
60,000
years ago.
Figurative
art,
music,
trade,
and other
forms of
behaviors that
hint at
intelligence,
however,
only started
to become
evident around
30,000
years ago.
This is
when examples
of art,
such as the
Venus figurines,
the cave
paintings in
the Chauvet
cave,
and musical
instruments such
as the
bone pipe
of Geissen
Clusterla
started to
appear.
The human
brain has
evolved
gradually
over the
passage of
time,
a series
of
incremental
changes
that occurred
as a result
of external
stimuli
and conditions.
This is
still true
today.
You give
a child
toys that
exercise
intelligence
at a
young age,
and that
child becomes
more likely
to handle
gradually
more complex
toys and
systems as
she or he
develops more
intelligent
circuitry in
their brain.
Neuroplasticity,
the ability of
our brains to
develop the
parts of it
that we
train,
is an
incredible tool
for developing
intelligence.
There is one
challenge facing
it, however,
which is a bit
of a biological
problem that we
have not yet
been able to
solve.
Death.
To overcome
death as the
obstacle that
was hindering the
evolution of
human intelligence,
our ancestors
developed the
killer app that
propelled our
species forward by
leaps and
bounds ahead of
all others.
Namely, spoken
and written
language in
words and
math.
I believe
communication was
and still is
our most
valuable invention.
It has helped
us preserve the
knowledge,
learning,
discoveries and
intelligence we
have gained,
and pass them
on from person
to person and
from generation
to generation.
Imagine if
Einstein had had
no way of
telling the rest
of us about
his remarkable
understanding of
the theory of
relativity.
In the absence
of our incredible
abilities to
communicate,
each and every
one of us
would need to
discover relativity
on his or
her own.
Good luck
with that.
Leaps of
human intelligence
have happened
then as a
response to
the way human
society and
culture developed.
A lot of our
intelligence resulted
from our
interaction with
each other and
not just in
response to our
environments.
The cerebral
cortex, which
happens to be
larger in humans
than in any
other intelligent
species, is
populated with
neural circuits
dedicated to
language,
particularly in
the temporal,
parietal, and
frontal lobes.
Other parts of
the cerebral
cortex are
responsible for
higher thought
processes such
as reasoning,
abstract thinking,
and decision
making.
The size of
those parts
sets us apart
from species of
high-degree
intelligence such
as dolphins and
great apes.
Other differences
include a more
developed new
cortex, a
folding of the
cerebral cortex,
and von
economo neurons
which basically
all translate
into more
processing power
or the ability
to think
better.
In short,
the complexity
of human
intelligence
emerged inside
our specific
culture and
history as a
result of our
attempts to
survive our
harsh ecological
conditions.
This happened
through the
process of
growing larger
and more
sophisticated
brains and
by sharing
our knowledge
through the
use of
language.
This may not
seem to be
hugely relevant
to the
development of
AI, but
it is.
Bear with
me.
Our
intelligence as
a species
evolved.
We all
became smarter
than our
ancestors and
some of us
became smarter
than others.
In the
process, the
intelligence of
other species
such as the
great ape or
the chimpanzee,
for example,
did not keep
up.
While they
were subjected
more or less
to the same
environmental
conditions,
they did not
exercise their
intelligence in
ways that grew
their brains and
enhanced their
ability to acquire
knowledge and
recycle it.
Because of that,
they got left
behind.
And now,
who's the boss
of the planet
able to put
them in cages
for our
entertainment?
We are.
This concept
of how our
intelligence evolves
because of the
way we use it
is also very
visible within
the human race
itself.
It's clear
that if we
all came from
the same
small African
bunch that
survived the
Toba catastrophe,
then we
all more or
less had the
chance to
achieve the
same heights
of intelligence,
but that is
clearly not
the case.
In general,
you will find
that scientific
discoveries and
tech innovations,
for example,
are forms of
intelligence that
tend to be more
prevalent in the
advanced parts of
our world than
they are in
emerging markets.
Those shifts
are the result of
years of pushing
in the same
direction, a
phenomenon that I
like to call
compounded
intelligence.
Advanced societies
benefit from
years of
valuing the
need for
this type of
intelligence and
developing tools
to pass it on,
while emerging
countries often
value perhaps
survival skills,
street smarts,
and spiritual
intelligence, if
the term makes
sense.
The ones that
are science smart,
I used to be
one, in these
developing countries,
are usually
rejected and
ridiculed.
They are attracted
to migrate to
the countries
where this form
of intelligence
thrives.
For similar
reasons, you
will find that
mathematical
ability tends
to be higher
in Russia and
several Asian
countries such
as Korea than
in the rest of
the world.
Russia still
leads at least
in terms of
passion when it
comes to rocket
science.
However,
companies such
as Google in
countries like
the US continue
to attract some
of the most
brilliant minds
from every
corner of the
world to become
innovators in
highly acclaimed
intelligence hubs
such as Google's
innovation lab,
Google X.
Regardless of
the inequality of
intelligence
distribution,
wherever they are,
one thing is
clear.
Very important,
those with the
highest intelligence
end up ruling
their world.
Which sucks
for some of us,
but at least
it's good for
humanity as we
continue to use
our intelligence
to stay on top
of the food
chain.
Now, as we
keep evolving
our intelligence
and grasp more
and more of the
complexity of the
world, it seems
that humans are
approaching the
theoretical level
of how far
our own
biological
intelligence can
take us.
It is not that
discoveries are
not being made,
but that the
really complex
problems now
have too wide
a span for
even the
smartest minds.
A true
understanding of
our universe
in a unified
theory may
require a lot
more than
just one field
or even
all of physics.
It may need
a wider
view that
includes
biology,
astronomy,
and maybe
even
spirituality.
Finding a
path out
of climate
change may
need the
best minds
of environmentalists,
business leaders,
politicians,
and scientists
to work
together as
one.
The challenge
we face
simply is
one of
specialization.
To attain
the depths
needed to
understand a
field of
knowledge to
any level
of proficiency,
one has to
forego breadth.
With the
increasing
complexity of
our knowledge,
even the
smartest mind
needs to
focus entirely
on one area
of knowledge
to become a
specialist in it.
This limits
their exposure
to other fields
and,
hence,
their ability
to include
them within
their spectrum
of intelligence.
Remember,
specialization
is creating
silos of
intelligence
that are
incapable
of working
together.
Moreover,
we lack
efficiency
in our
ability to
communicate.
For me
to be able
to transmit
the simple
concepts
contained within
this paragraph
to you,
it took me
four to five
minutes to
type the
250 words,
and it
would take
you around
a couple
of minutes
to listen
and grasp
the concepts.
Bandwidth,
the speed
at which
data can
be transmitted
across a
connection,
is a feature
of human
intelligence
that is
highly
constrained.
If I
sent you
this entire
book over
a high-speed
internet
connection,
it would
take you
seconds to
download,
but days
to read
it or
hours to
listen to
it.
This is
why we
are unable
to think
together as
one seamless
intelligent
system as
our highly
scalable
parallel
computers can
do.
Our best
biologists
have no
clue how
to comprehend
what our
top physicists
know,
and most
of our
scientists
fail to
grasp much
of what
our spiritual
leaders
teach.
Remember,
we don't
have the
bandwidth of
communication
needed to
share knowledge
at sufficient
speed.
It's ironic
that what has
separated us
from all
other beings,
our ability
to communicate,
is now
becoming our
biggest
hindrance.
Even if we
took the time
to share all
our knowledge,
we don't have
the memory
capacity to
store it all
in our
heads.
Neither do
we have the
processing power
in any one
brain to
crunch the
massive amount
of knowledge
needed to
arrive at
solutions or
grasp universal
concepts.
This need
for specialization,
the constrained
bandwidth of
our ability to
communicate,
our limited
memory capacity
and processing
power,
means even
the smartest
of minds
is approaching
the limits
of human
intelligence.
We were
not always
smart and
we may
not always
remain the
smartest.
There seems
to be a
clear need
for new
forms of
intelligence
to augment
our own
and this
is driving
much excitement
about one
that promises
to supersede
ours,
machine
intelligence.
The myth
smart machines
have been a
fantasy of
humanity for
millennia.
Early
references to
mechanical and
artificial beings
appear in
Greek myths
starting with
Hephaestus,
the Greek
god of
blacksmiths,
carpenters,
craftsmen,
artisans,
and sculptors
who created
his golden
robots.
In the
Middle Ages,
mystical or
alchemical means
of creating
artificial forms
of life
continued.
The Muslim
chemist
Jabir ibn Hayyan's
stated goal
was
taquine,
which refers to
the creation of
synthetic life in
the laboratory
up to and
including human
life.
Rabbi
Yudah
Lov,
widely known
to the
scholars of
Judaism as
the
Maharal of
Prague,
told the
story of
Gollum,
an animated
being that
is created
entirely from
inanimate matter,
usually clay or
mud,
which has now
become folklore.
And myths
have been
intermixed with
stories of
engineering marvel.
Legend has it
that in the
third century
BC,
a mechanical
engineer,
an artificer
known as
Yon-Chi,
presented to
King Mu
of Saw,
an animated
life-size
mechanical
human-shaped
figure.
Legend goes
that the
king was
absolutely
entranced
by Yon-Chi's
creation.
Apparently,
this figure
could walk
so well
and move
its head
in such a
way as to
convince everyone
who saw it
that it was
a real
human being.
king was
so proud
that he
made the
robot
perform in
front of
some guests.
All went
well until
the robot
started to
wink and
flirt with
the ladies
who were
present.
Enraged,
the king
was about
to execute
Yon-Chi
there and
then,
but the
quick-witted
engineer
quickly
disassembled
his creation
to show
the king
what the
robot was
really made
off,
a collection
of pieces
made of
wood,
leather,
glue,
and paint.
Mollified,
the king
took a
closer look.
The robot
contained
artificial
replicas
of all
human
internal
organs
including
a heart,
lungs,
liver,
kidneys,
and stomach,
covered by
realistic-looking
muscles,
joints,
skin,
hair,
and teeth.
The fascination
with creating
artificial
intelligent
life
continued,
and by
the 19th
century,
artificial men
and thinking
machines were
appearing in
popular fiction.
Mary Shelley's
Monster in
Frankenstein
and Karel
Chepik's
RUR,
which introduced
the term
robot as in
Rossum's
Universal
Robots,
are a couple
of the
best-known.
AI has
continued to
be an
important
element of
science fiction
into the
present day
with an
endless
stream of
movies that
mostly center
around one
idea.
The machines
are coming
and it's not
going to be
cool.
I'll come
back to some
of these
imaginative
movies and
how they
predict our
future in a
bit, but
first, let's
visit the
historical
facts.
The true
story so
far.
Realistic
humanoid
automata
were built
by craftsmen
from every
civilization.
The oldest
known automata
were the
sacred statues
of ancient
Egypt and
Greece.
Although
obviously these
things didn't
really work,
people of
faith believed
that craftsmen
had imbued
the figures
with very
real minds
capable of
wisdom and
emotion.
Hermes
Trismegistus,
author of a
series of
sacred texts
known as
the Hermetic
Corpus,
which formed
the basis
of Hermeticism,
wrote that
by discovering
the true
nature of
the gods,
man has
been able
to reproduce
it.
As humanity
progressed,
real attempts
at animated
humanoids
started to
emerge.
The early
attempts
naturally
invented
no
intelligence
but
undeniably
produced
mechanical
genius.
Ismail
al-Jazari,
1136-1206,
was a
Muslim
polymath
incredibly
learned
across a
range of
disciplines
including
mechanical
engineering
and
mathematics.
He is
most famous
for writing
the Book
of Knowledge
of Ingenious
Mechanical
Devices,
in which
he describes
100
mechanical
devices
and gives
instructions
on how
to construct
them.
One of
these was
a musical
automaton
consisting
of a
boat
containing
four
automated
musicians.
He would
float this
boat on
a lake
to entertain
guests
at royal
drinking
parties.
Professor
Noel Sharkey,
a British
expert on
robotics,
recently
tried to
reconstruct
this,
building a
programmable
drum machine
with pegs
that bumped
into little
levers which
operated the
percussion.
The drummer
could be made
to play
different rhythms
and different
drum patterns
if the pegs
were moved
around.
Another of
Al-Jazri's
inventions
was a
waitress
that could
serve water,
tea,
or other
drinks.
The drink
was stored
in a tank
with a
reservoir
from which
it dripped
into a
bucket,
and after
seven minutes
into a
cup,
and then
the waitress
would appear
from out
of an
automatic
door serving
the drink.
Clever
stuff for
the time,
indeed.
In the
late
18th century,
Wolfgang von
Kempelen,
a Hungarian
author and
inventor,
created the
well-known
Mechanical
Turk.
He tried
to pass
this off
as a
chess-playing
automaton,
but it
was in
fact a
hoax,
consisting
of a
life-size
model of
a human
head and
body,
wearing
Turkish
robes and
a turban,
which sat
behind a
large cabinet
on top of
which a
chess board
was placed.
The
automaton
was apparently
an excellent
chess player,
beating many
human opponents,
but in
reality,
a human
chess master
was hidden
inside,
puppeteering
the Turk
with secret
levers.
It was
not really
a machine,
but rather
a bit
of a magic
trick.
Miniaturized
copies of
many of
these elaborate
works of
mechanical
excellence can
probably be
found in
toy shops
today.
Most of
us would
not even
pay for
them as
they don't
appear that
impressive
anymore.
They were
not really
intelligent,
but they
set the
scene for
engineers and
dreamers to
believe that
creating a
human-like
machine was
possible.
All that
was needed
was a
different type
of machine.
We did
not have to
wait long,
and in the
early 20th
century,
that machine
arrived.
The computer.
Most of the
computer systems
humanity has
invented,
and by that
I mean the
vast majority
of computers
until the
turn of the
21st century,
were not
smart at
all.
they were
nothing more
than dumb
slaves that
performed what
their masters,
the programmers,
told them to
do.
They obeyed and
did what they
were told,
only they did
it very,
very fast.
When you think
about it,
the early Google,
which has helped
humanity organize
all of the
world's
information,
was not
smart at all.
Those who
built it
were.
For years,
Google's
apparent genius
was just a
result of its
ability to rank
a massive
number of
websites and
find out which
pages came out
on top in
terms of how
many other
pages mentioned
them.
The larger the
number of
references a
page received,
the higher its
importance and
relevance to
searchers.
This algorithm
is known as
page rank,
and despite its
apparent simplicity,
it created the
Google we
can't live
without today.
Amazon and
Spotify were
not being smart
at all when
they recommended
things and
songs that
they thought
you might
like.
They just
observed those
who liked the
products you
purchased or
songs you
listened to and
told you what
else the majority
of those people
had purchased
or listened to.
Those systems
simply summarized
the collective
intelligence of
all of us,
they did not
develop any
intelligence of
their own.
This started to
change drastically
around the turn
of the century.
They're here.
As machine
learning and
artificial intelligence
became more
mainstream in the
late 1990s,
it started a
trend that had
accelerated to an
outright mania by
the new millennium.
After many years
of failed
attempts, we
started to
witness promising
signs of a
form of
intelligence that
is non-biological,
not human.
Unless you
live among the
apes in the
heart of Africa,
you probably
hear the term
AI several
times a week.
What you may
not realize is
that this
deafening buzz
is nothing new.
Among us
computer geeks,
we have spoken
about AI
equally as
passionately
since the
1950s.
In fact,
you can go
back even
further.
A challenge
put forth by
mathematicians in
the 1920s and
the 1930s was
to answer a
fundamental
question.
Can all
mathematical
reasoning be
formalized?
In the
following decades,
the answers that
came from some
of the 20th
century's topmost
math prodigies
Kurt Gudel,
Alan Turing,
and Alonzo
Church were
surprising in
two ways.
Firstly,
they proved
that, in
fact, there
are limits to
what mathematical
logic can
accomplish.
Secondly, and
more importantly
for AI, the
answers suggested
that within
these limits,
any form of
mathematical
reasoning could
be mechanized.
Church and
Turing offered
a thesis
implying that
any mechanical
device capable
of shuffling
symbols as
simple as
0 and 1
could imitate
any conceivable
process of
mathematical
deduction.
This was the
basis for the
Turing machine,
a mathematical
model of
computation that
defined a
machine capable
of manipulating
symbols on a
strip of tape
according to a
table of
rules.
Simple as it
was, this
invention inspired
scientists to
begin discussing
the possibility
of thinking
machines.
And that, in
my personal
view, was the
point at which
the work to
deliver intelligent
machines, so
long the object
of humanity's
fantasies, actually
started.
These scientists
so strongly
believed back
then in the
inevitability of
a thinking
machine that, in
1950, Alan
Turing proposed
a test, it
came to be
known as the
Turing test, that
set an early
and still
relevant bar to
see if artificial
intelligence could
measure up to
human intelligence.
In simple
terms, he
suggested a
natural language
conversation between
an evaluator, a
human, and a
machine designed
to generate
human-like
responses.
If the
evaluator is
not able to
reliably tell
the machine from
the human, the
machine is said to
have passed the
test.
There were no
machines even
close to natural
language recognition
then, but oh
my, has that
changed.
In the last 70
years, our
machines have
learned to
play, see,
speak, drive,
and reason beyond
our wildest
expectations.
Machines have
played games
since 1951.
Today, they
are the world
champion of
every game that
they play.
The first game a
machine played was
drafts, or
checkers, using a
program developed by
Christopher Strachey
for the Ferranti
Mark I machine of
the University of
Manchester.
Dietrich
Prinz wrote one
for chess.
Then, Arthur
Samuel's, a
checkers program
developed in the
mid-1950s and
early 1960s,
eventually achieved
sufficient skill to
challenge a
respectable amateur.
Not much of an
intelligence, I agree,
but look at how far
we've come today.
Humans lost the top
position in
backgammon in
1992, in
checkers in
1994, and in
1999, IBM's
Deep Blue beat
Gary Kasparov, the
reigning chess world
champion.
Then, in 2016, we
totally lost gaming
to a subsidiary of
the giant Google.
For years, Google's
DeepMind technologies
had used gaming as
a method of
developing artificial
intelligence.
In 2016, DeepMind
developed AlphaGo, a
computer AI capable of
playing an ancient
Chinese board game,
Go.
Go is known to be the
most complex game on
our planet because of
the infinite different
strategies available to
the player at any
point in time.
To give you an idea of
the scale we're talking
about here, there are
more possible moves on
the Go board than
there are atoms in the
entire universe.
Just think of that.
This makes it
practically impossible
for a computer to
calculate every possible
move in a game.
There is just not
enough memory and
processing power
available on the
planet, and even if
there was, it would
probably be wiser to
use it to simulate the
universe than to play a
game, I'm sure you'll
agree.
To win in Go, a
computer needs
intuition.
It needs to think
intelligently, like a
human, but be
smarter.
That's what DeepMind
achieved.
In March 2016, as
much as 10 years
before even the
most optimistic AI
analysts predicted it
would happen, AlphaGo
beat champion Lee
Seedol, then ranked
second worldwide in
Go, in a five-game
match.
Then, in 2017, at the
Future of Go Summit,
its successor, AlphaGo
Master, beat KG, the
world number one ranked
player at the time, in a
three-game match.
So, AlphaGo Master
officially became the
world champion.
With no humans left to
beat, DeepMind developed
a new AI from scratch,
AlphaGo Zero, to play
against AlphaGo Master.
After just a short period
of training, AlphaGo Zero
achieved a 100-0 victory
against the champion,
AlphaGo Master.
its successor, the
self-taught Alpha Zero,
is currently perceived as
the world champion of
Go.
Oh, and by the way, the
same algorithm was then
asked to play chess, and
it is now the world
champion in that too.
Remember, the smartest
gamers in our world
today are no longer
humans.
The smartest are
artificial intelligence
machines.
So, that's games.
Machines have also been
learning how to
communicate in natural
human languages since
1964.
The first notable success
was Daniel Bobrow's
program, Student, which
was designed to read and
solve the kind of word
problems found in high
school algebra books.
Tom is six foot two
inches tall.
His younger brother's
friend, Dan, is three
quarters as tall as his
brother, Juan.
If Juan is three inches
taller than two-thirds of
Tom's height, how tall is
Dan?
Student was not only able
to solve the underlying
mathematics of the
problem, but as early as
1964, it could also
understand the English in
which the problem was
written, something many
mathematically disinclined
students still struggle
with today.
Impressive.
Around the same time,
Josef Weizenbaum's
Eliza, the world's first
chatbot, could carry out
conversations that were
so realistic she could
occasionally fool users
into believing she was
human.
Created at the MIT
Artificial Intelligence
Laboratory, Eliza in fact
had no idea what she was
talking about.
She simply repeated back
what had been said to
her, rephrasing it by
using a few grammatical
rules or responding with
a canned response.
Her sibling, Alexa,
Amazon's personal AI
assistant, is much, much
smarter.
Alexa, as well as Google
Assistant, Apple's Siri and
Microsoft's Cortana, are
capable of understanding us
humans very well.
While not pretending too
hard to be human, they
surely can, on occasion,
pass the Turing test.
Sometimes, these AI
programs take their
understanding of language
even further, as they
translate between languages
with shocking accuracy.
Another self-taught type of
intelligence that some of the
most advanced translation AIs
today have learned, from
observing patterns of how
humans translate, found in
documents online.
All of this makes it seem
okay to be talking to
machines, exactly as I did
when I dictated this
paragraph to my phone using
otter.ai, which converts my
exotic English accent very
swiftly and efficiently, I may
add, into the written words I am
reading to you right now.
So, unless there is a human
out there who can listen to
millions of people in tens of
different languages at the same
time, as well as typing,
translating, responding, or
reacting as seamlessly as these
machines can do, then,
remember, the smartest
communicators in our world today
are no longer humans.
The smartest are artificial
intelligence machines.
But if listening, understanding,
and speaking is still not
impressive enough, look at how
our computers can see.
In the late 1960s, computer
vision research started.
It was designed to mimic the
human visual system as a
stepping stone to endowing
robots with intelligent behavior
based on what they could see.
Studies in the 1970s formed the
early foundation for many of the
computer vision algorithms that
exist today, including extracting
edges from images, labeling lines,
optical flow, and motion
estimation.
The 1980s saw studies based on more
rigorous mathematical analysis,
while in the 1990s, research
advanced 3D reconstructions.
This was also the decade when,
for the first time, statistical
learning techniques were used to
recognize faces in images.
All of the above, however, were
based on traditional computer
programming, and while they
delivered impressive results, they
failed to offer the accuracy and
scale today's computer vision can
offer due to the advancement of deep
learning artificial intelligence
techniques, which have completely
surpassed and replaced all prior
methods.
This intelligence did not learn to see
by following a programmer's list of
instructions, but rather through the
very act of seeing itself.
With AI helping computers see, they can now do it
much better than we do, specifically when it
comes to individual tasks.
Optical character recognition allows computers to
read text just as you would read.
Object recognition allows them to recognize
objects in a picture or in the real world through the
lens of a camera.
Computers today not only recognize the items you take off the
shelf in an Amazon Go store, but they can give you all the
information you need to know about a historical
monument if you just point your phone at it and use Google
goggles.
The same computers can detect a vehicle passing across a toll
station or abnormal cells or tissues in a medical image, as
well as find the face of a criminal among thousands of
people on a busy street.
Because they see so well, computers can now manipulate images
and videos in ways that are close to impossible for a human
to do.
They can do image restoration of a damaged photo, touch up your
face to make you look even more stunning before you post it to
Instagram, produce full 3D models from 2D photos,
and use optical flow to detect, animate, and project movement of
an object in a video.
Let me know if you can do that.
I'm sure you can't because, remember, the smartest visual
observers are no longer humans.
The smartest are artificial intelligence machines.
Because they can now hear, see, understand, speak, and play,
those machines can now park and drive a car, pick up and manipulate
objects, fly a plane or a drone, and, sadly, shoot a target from a
distance of several miles without human intervention.
At each of those tasks, their skill beats ours.
It only takes them just a few hours, days, or months of learning to beat us.
And they are still learning.
Thousands of them.
For thousands of hours every day.
Hearing this, you may get the impression that we made steady progress for decades to
get to where we are today.
And accordingly, that we need a few more decades for the next significant milestone to happen.
You'd be wrong in that assumption.
So, just like in a typical sci-fi movie, I will now flash back.
Allow me to tell you the story again, focusing this time on the timeline.
Let's go back to 1956.
It didn't take that long.
AI has not evolved gradually over the last 75 years to get to where it is today.
Even though humanity started to commit to AI back in the 1950s, the truth is we didn't
make much progress at all until the turn of the millennium.
The early beginnings of AI did not enjoy an abundance of computer power or possess the
information needed to teach the machines very much.
All of the excited computer scientists who were driven by the dream of the Dartmouth Workshop,
the summer research project held at Dartmouth College in the U.S. back in 1956, which is
considered the birthplace of artificial intelligence, attempted to create examples of artificial
intelligence that didn't really work and, more importantly, that were still replicas of
human intelligence bestowed on the computers through accurate instructions written in lines
of code.
The infinitesimal progress made over the next 17 years, however, came to a halt in 1973 in
what is known as the first AI winter.
That was when the Middle Eastern oil crisis halted the funding of AI projects.
In the 1980s, efforts to revive AI, mostly led by Japan, channeled investment into research, once
more leading to the development of very little real intelligence as compared to the hype and
excitement surrounding it.
Until it was halted again in 1987, again due to an economic crisis.
This is known as the second AI winter.
Sporadic attempts at AI followed the economic recovery, but it wasn't until the turn of the
millennium, when we stumbled upon the biggest breakthrough in the history of AI, that we
started to make real progress.
This breakthrough has become known as deep learning.
My first eye-opening exposure to the topic was through a white paper that was published
by Google in 2009.
The paper discussed how Google deployed a bit of its abundant computer power to run an experiment
in which the machine was asked to watch YouTube videos frame by frame and try to observe recurring
patterns.
The machine was completely unprompted, meaning it was not told which patterns to look for,
just to observe and see if patterns could be found.
It did not take long before a familiar pattern was detected, one that tends to occur very frequently
on YouTube.
A small, fairy, fuzzy moving object.
Yeah, it was a cat.
The computer did not just recognize the side view or the front view or the face of a cat.
They observed the whole pattern of entitled cuteness and applied it to every shape in
a YouTube video that could resemble a cat.
Once that pattern was labeled as a cat, the machine could easily find every single one of
those felines across the hundreds of millions of videos on YouTube.
It wasn't too long afterwards that the machine could find letters, words, humans, nudity, cars,
and most of the other recurring entities that exist online.
These neural networks, as we call them, built through deep learning, truly were the beginning
of AI as we know it today.
Everything before that can be considered almost negligible.
Though, as I will show you in the next chapter, it was actually typical of the type of buildup
needed to finally find the breakthrough.
Since then, funding has flooded into the field of AI.
Countless groups of small startups and hundreds of thousands of brilliant engineers have been
tackling a variety of challenges and opportunities using the exact same technique.
The more that small successes are achieved, the more money pours in from investors hoping to
enjoy a slice of the imminent commercial returns such innovations can bring.
As a result, AI as a discipline has started to accelerate massively.
But all of this has only taken place in the last few years.
Why am I telling you this?
Because it's important to observe the trajectory of the trend.
If you were to assume that it took us 75 years to get here, you might predict that it could
take tens of more years to have any meaningful impact for artificial intelligence coming into
our life.
The rate of progress, as with every other technology, was very slow at first, but it is now moving
at an exponential speed.
The next 10 years of artificial intelligence development are expected to deliver a very
unfamiliar future, one that might seem closer to fiction than to the reality of our life today.
Please refer to Diagram 2 in your PDF pack to observe the rapid acceleration of AI since the
turn of the century.
You can find the PDF pack from your audio book provider or on mogouda.com slash resources.
Let's switch gears now and explore what that future might look like.
We now know where we came from.
So let's ask the question, perhaps the most crucial question humanity has ever needed to ask.
Where will intelligence, specifically machine intelligence, go from here?
Chapter 2 A Brief History of Our Future
Look around you.
Observe all of the technology that you have interacted with today.
Look at how brilliantly those photos are displayed on your ultra-high-resolution touchscreen.
Look at how you can zoom in and rotate to see things more clearly than the naked eye.
Notice how simple tools enable you to modify your photos so that you can appear like the fashion icon that you really are.
Enjoy all the videos, be they entertainment, education, or news, that stream through thin air to your device from all over the world.
Think about all of the messages and content, silly as they may seem, that your friends share with you on social media.
Don't be a stranger.
Video call one of them and see how they laugh at your jokes.
Text another and plan to meet for coffee.
Send them a pin on a digital map and let their phone guide them there.
Search for anything.
Just ask and you will receive millions of answers.
Observe how your phone now understands your spoken words and obeys your every command.
Enjoy tens of millions of songs.
Every song you've ever heard or loved ready to play at your command.
Become aware of how your Bluetooth headset connects wirelessly to your device,
which connects over the air to well-hidden cell towers that bring you anything that you will ever need to know.
But don't just look down at your screen.
Pay attention as you walk the streets.
Notice that fully electric car that silently just passed by.
Yes, the one that can park itself or even drive itself from coast to coast.
Think about the treadmill at the gym and how you could run in place for miles and miles
while watching the news updates on your large screen monitor while simultaneously getting all the necessary information about how far you've run,
how fast you're going, how many calories you've burned, and how your heart rate is keeping up.
Just tap your phone once and get all of that information along with everything from your fitness tracker all in one place
to measure how well you're doing on your path to that elusive six-pack.
The list of fascinating tech is endless.
Think of the massive flat-screen TVs that keep us entertained.
Think of all the medical equipment that scans our bodies and brains,
measures our vital signs and keeps us healthy.
Think of the audio player that you may be listening to this audiobook on,
of electronic trading, credit cards, cryptocurrency, and online banking,
and how each redefines our relationship with money.
Game consoles that alter the very essence of how we play.
Plastic surgery that reshapes our bodies to conform to our wildest fantasies or to societal pressures.
There are endless technological marvels that in the past would have been considered at the very least a luxury,
but more likely a fantasy.
Things even the mightiest of kings would never have dreamed of.
Give yourself a moment to take it all in,
and then ask yourself this question.
If you had told your grandmother 50 years ago that this would be your life today,
what would she have said?
She would have thought you'd gone mad, I can assure you.
Every bit of what I've just described, back then, was considered to be science fiction.
If you had shown up with this tech in the Middle Ages,
believe me, you would have been burned at the stake for your sorcery.
Yet, we all take it for granted.
We complain when the battery power of our phone dwindles by the end of the day
and forget that those little devils are orders of magnitude more powerful than the NASA computer
that put a man on the moon.
We feel impatient when the internet takes a second more to load
and forget that just 25 years ago we all needed to walk to a bookshop to search for knowledge.
I wrote this chapter while I was on a plane from London to Dubai.
The flight boarded around 20 minutes late, and when the delay was announced,
I observed the faces of my fellow passengers turn grumpy, even angry.
The 6 hour and 40 minutes flight had just become 7.
What a disaster!
Somehow, we have come to take our astonishing reality for granted.
We forget this while we fly incredibly like a bird in the sky at 40,000 feet.
For those few hours, we watch a movie, have a meal, horrible as that might be,
and rest a little before we emerge on the other side of the world.
We forget that just a century ago, this trip would have taken months
across such harsh trains that many of us would have never made it.
We take so much of our progress for granted that 20 extra minutes
feels for some like the world has just come to an end.
We are surrounded by technological magic, and yet, we tend to discount it all.
The same tendency is also projected forward into the future.
We tend to underestimate what is possible in the same way as we take what we have for granted.
And that is a problem.
Most of us respond like grandma.
When we are told the world is changing beyond recognition, we refuse to believe it.
We revert back to our discounted perception of reality.
We project that the familiar will last.
We reject the possibilities of the future and frame them as nothing more than madness and science fiction fantasy.
But they are not.
As the trajectory of technological development, specifically in the area of AI,
has accelerated to a blazing speed in just the last 10 years,
it is important to stop discounting what we already have and take account of what's truly happening here.
We can no longer ignore this, because at the pace of progress we are currently observing,
if we blink, we may actually miss the next crucial few steps and stumble as we walk into that future.
This is why I am writing this book.
It is why I write it for you.
Open your eyes.
This is your wake-up call.
This is very important.
Sci-fi has ended.
We are living in the age of sci-fact.
Sci-fi or sci-fact
To help us align on just how far humanity has come,
let's play a game that I call sci-fi or sci-fact.
The game is simple.
I describe a scene that appeared in a famous science fiction movie,
and you tell me if you expect this scenario to actually become a reality in our lifetime,
become science fact,
or if it will remain in our memories as a clever science fiction story.
There surely is no better place to illustrate how this game is played than with Star Trek,
the quintessential starting point for most sci-fi fans of my generation.
In Star Trek, Captain Kirk and the crew of the Enterprise carried devices that they called
handheld communicators.
These were small black devices the size of a cigarette box with a transparent cover.
Once the cover was opened, you could talk to other members of the crew,
regardless of where they were.
To us at the time, this was considered utter, albeit clever, fiction.
So, here's your first question.
Sci-fi or sci-fact?
Do you think we will ever use such fascinating devices in your lifetime and mine?
The answer is obviously yes.
The Motorola StarTAC, um, clever branding there, Motorola,
and other clamshell-designed mobile phones were a fad in the 1990s.
They looked unmistakably similar to the handheld communicators of Star Trek,
and these devices are now considered antiquities in comparison to today's phones.
Your answer surely should be sci-fact.
Good. Now that you know how the game is played, let's try a few more questions.
The captain of the fleet used a personal access data device, or pad,
to punch the coordinates of the next star system.
Other Starfleet personnel used it to watch videos and listen to music.
Sci-fi or sci-fact?
Do you think this will happen in your lifetime?
Of course.
Tablets are tech miracles that don't really impress us that much anymore.
Sci-fact.
And just for the record, iPads, clever branding their Apple,
are not only used to watch videos and listen to music,
they are surely the device most used by pilots of non-commercial flights
to punch in their coordinates and navigate the skies.
How about the Universal Translator, that marvelous device that could decode what the alien said in real time?
Sci-fi or sci-fact?
Do you think we will use Universal Translators in our lifetime?
Sci-fi or sci-fact for sure.
You can use Google Translate to do this today.
Speak into your phone in one language and the app will repeat back to you what you just said in another language.
Listen for the response in any of more than 100 languages from the person you're speaking to,
and the app will translate that back into the language that you spoke in.
But enough beating around the bush.
See, we can get there.
I don't think we can use Universal Translator as well.
The Apple Translator in
