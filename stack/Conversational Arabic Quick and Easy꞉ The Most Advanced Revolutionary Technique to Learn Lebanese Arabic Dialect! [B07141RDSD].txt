About myself
For many years I struggled to learn Spanish
and I still knew no more than about 20 words.
Consequently, I was extremely frustrated.
One day I stumbled upon this method
as I was playing around with word combinations.
Suddenly, I came to the realization
that every language has a certain core group of words
that are most commonly used
and simply by learning them
one could gain the ability
to engage in quick and easy conversational Spanish.
I discovered which words those were
and I narrowed them down
to 350
that, once memorized,
one could connect
and create one's own sentences.
The variations were and are infinite.
By using this incredibly simple technique,
I could converse at a proficient level
and speak Spanish.
Within a week,
I astonished my Spanish-speaking friends
with my newfound ability.
The next semester,
I registered at my university
for a Spanish-language course
and I applied the same principles
I had learned in that class.
Grammar,
additional vocabulary,
future,
and past tense,
etc.
To those 350 words
I already had memorized
and immediately,
I felt
as if I had grown wings
and learned how to fly.
At the end of the semester,
we took a class trip
to San Jose, Costa Rica.
I was like a fish in water
while the rest of my classmates
were floundering
and still struggling
to converse.
Throughout the following months,
I again applied
the same principle
to other languages,
French,
Portuguese,
Italian,
and Arabic,
all of which
I now speak proficiently
thanks to this
very simple technique.
This method
is by far
the fastest way
to master quick
and easy
conversational language skills.
There is no
other technique
that compares
to my concept.
It is effective.
It worked for me
and it will work
for you.
Be consistent
with my program
and you too
will succeed
the way
I
and many,
many others have.

Introduction
to the program
People often
dream about
learning a foreign language
but usually
they never do it.
Some feel
that they just
won't be able
to do it
while others
believe
that they don't
have the time.
Whatever your reason is,
it's time
to set that aside.
With my new method,
you will have
enough time
and you will not fail.
You will actually
learn
how to speak
the fundamentals
of the language
fluently
in as little
as a few days.
Of course,
you won't speak
perfect Lebanese
dialect
at first
but
you will certainly
gain
significant
proficiency.
For example,
If you travel
to Lebanon,
you will
almost
effortlessly
be able
to engage
in basic
conversational
communication
with the locals
in the present tense
and
you will
no longer
be intimidated
by culture shock.
It's time
to relax.
Learning
a language
is a valuable
skill
that
connects
people
of multiple
cultures
around the world
and you now
have the tools
to join them.
How does
my method
work?
I have taken
27 of the
most commonly
used languages
in the world
and distilled
them
350
most frequently
used words
in any language.
This process
took
three years
of observation
and research
and during
that time
I determined
which words
I felt
were most
important
for this method
of basic
conversational
communication.
In that time
I chose
these words
in such a way
that they were
structurally
interrelated
and that
when combined
form sentences.
Thus
once you succeed
in memorizing
these words
you will be able
to combine
these words
and form
your own
sentences.
The words
are spread
over 20
tracks.
The words
will also
combine
easily
in sentences
for example
enabling
you to
ask
simple
questions
make
basic
statements
and
obtain
a rudimentary
understanding
of others'
communications.
In fact
there are
just
nine
basic
words
that will
effectively
build
bridges
enabling
you
to speak
in an
understandable
manner.
Please see
building
bridges.
I have
also
created
memorization
made easy
techniques
for this
program
in order
to help
with the
memorization
of the
vocabulary.
Please
also see
reading
and
pronunciation
of Arabic
accents
in order
to gain
proficiency
in the
reading
and
pronunciation
of the
Arabic
language
prior
to
starting
this
program.
My book
is mainly
intended
for basic
present tense
vocal
communication
meaning
anyone
can easily
use it
to get
by
linguistically
while
visiting
a foreign
country
without
learning
the entire
language.
With
practice
you will
be 100%
understandable
to native
speakers
which is
your aim
one
disclaimer
this
is not
a grammar
book
though
it does
address
minor
and essential
grammar
rules
therefore
understanding
complex
sentences
with
obscure
words
in Arabic
is beyond
the scope
of this
book.
People
who have
tried this
method
have been
successful
and by
the time
you finish
this book
you will
understand
and be
understood
in basic
conversational
Arabic.
This is
the best
basis
to learn
not only
the Arabic
language
but
any
language.
This is
an entirely
revolutionary
no-fail
concept
and your
ability
to combine
the pieces
of the
language
puzzle
together
will come
with great
ease
especially
if you
use this
program
prior to
beginning
an Arabic
class.
The Lebanese
Arabic
Dialect
Lebanese
Arabic
is a
Levantine
dialect.
The term
Levantine
derives
from
Levant
which is
the geographical
region of
the eastern
Mediterranean
that
encompasses
Cyprus
Lebanon
Syria
Israel
Palestine
Jordan
and the
Hatay
province
of southern
Turkey.
Several
languages
are spoken
in the
Levant
one of
which
is
Lebanese
Arabic.
Lebanese
Arabic
descends
from the
traditional
Arabic
language
though
there are
many variables
that affected
the development
of the
language.
Most
Lebanese
people speak
the language
and Arabic
remains its
written form.
Despite
past attempts
by some
to make
an alphabet
system
using
Latin
letters
some
people
view
Lebanese
as
merely
a
dialect
of
Arabic
while
others
accept
the
language
as
unique.
Either
way
the
word
connotations
vary
in both
languages
as do
their
syntax
and
vocabularies.
Lebanese
Arabic
uses a
bit
of
Turkish
and
Aramaic
vocabulary
and a
little
French.
In
general
keep in
mind
that
Lebanese
Arabic
is not
an
official
language
but
rather
a
colloquial
dialect
spoken
in
Lebanon.
Track

There
is
no
doubt
that
the
moment
you
succeed
in
memorizing
these
350
required
words
you
will
establish
the
best
foundation
for
becoming
fluent
in
the
Lebanese
Arabic
dialect.
The
only
catch
though
is
the
memorization
since
memorization
is not
easy
for
many
people.
However,
the
purpose
of this
audio book
is to
overcome
the
memorization
obstacle.
Each
track
begins
with a
vocabulary
box.
Below
every
box
there
are
sentences
formed
from
the
set
of
words
which
you
have
just
learned.
For
each
following
track
you
will
come
to
a
new
set
of
words.
The
sentences
below
that
will
be
formed
from
these
words
that
you
have
just
learned.
Along
with
words
you
have
also
encountered
on
previous
tracks
or
pages
if
you
are
following
along
with
the
paperback
or
e-book
version.
After
listening
to
this
audio
book
several
times
before
you
know
it
you
will
realize
that
you
have
developed
the
ability
to
easily
and
correctly
create
your
own
sentences
and
phrases
in
Egyptian
dialect.
Repeat
every
track
until
you
have
mastered
it
perfectly
by
using
this
method
of
constant
repetition.
You
will
easily
succeed.
the
technique
of
constant
repetition
has
been
tried
and
proven
to be
an
extremely
effective
way
to
learn
anything,
be it
driving,
playing
sports,
or
memorization.
if
you
think
about
it
everything
we
have
ever
learned
from
the
moment
we
were
born
was
by
the
use
of
the
constant
repetition
technique.
This
simple
technique
is
guaranteed
to
achieve
perfection
and
the
audiobook
will
make
the
memorization
aspect
of
this
book
a piece
of cake.
additionally
this
audiobook
has
proved
extremely
efficient
in
mastering
the
correct
pronunciation.
If
this is
your
first
time
listening
to
the
audiobook
it's
highly
recommended
that
you
can
follow
along
with
the
hard
copy

Arabic
Pronunciations
Please
master
the
following
page
in
Arabic
pronunciation
prior
to
starting
the
program.
Kha
For
Middle
Eastern
languages
including
Arabic
Hebrew
Farsi
Pashto
Urdu
Hindi
etc.
and also
German
to
properly
pronounce
the
kh
or
ch
is
essential
for
example
Khaled
a
Muslim
name
or
Hanukkah
a Jewish
holiday
or
Nacht
night
in German
The
best way
to
describe
kh
or
ch
is to
say
ka
or
ha
while at
the same
time
putting your
tongue
at the
back of
your throat
and
blowing air
it's
pronounced
similarly
to the
sound
that you
make
while clearing
your throat
please remember
this
whenever you
come across
any word
containing
kh
in this
program
ghin
the
Arabic
gh
is
equivalent
to
the
g
in
English
but
its
pronunciation
more
closely
resembles
the
French
r
rather
than
g
pronounce
it
at the
back
of
your
throat
the
sound
is
equivalent
to
what
you
would
make
when
gargling
water
gha
is
pronounced
more
as
gha
rather
than
gha
in
this
program
the
symbol
for
ghin
is
gh
so
keep
your
eyes
peeled
ain
is
pronounced
as
a
pronounced
deep

back
of
your
throat
rather
similar
to
the
sound
one
would
make
when
gagging
ha
is
pronounced
as
ha
pronunciation
takes
place
deep
at
the
back
of
your
throat
and
for
correct
pronunciation
one
must
constrict
the

of

you
may
notice
that
the
composition
of
some
of

might
sound
rather
clumsy
this
is
intentional
these
sentences
were
formulated
in
a
specific
way
to
serve
two
purposes
to
facilitate
the

memorization
of

and
to
teach
you
how
to
combine
the
words
in

to

than
making

keep
in

that
this
is
not
a

these

as

Conclusion
Congratulations
You have completed all the tools needed to master the Lebanese Arabic dialect
And I hope that this has been a valuable learning experience
Now you have sufficient communication skills to be confident enough to embark on a visit
To Lebanon
Impress your friends and boost your resume
So good luck
This program is available in other languages as well
And it is my fervent hope that my language learning programs will be used for good
Enabling people from all corners of the globe and from all cultures and religions
To be able to communicate harmoniously
After memorizing the required 350 words please perform a daily 5 minute exercise by creating sentences in your head using these words
This simple exercise will help you grasp conversational communications even more effectively
Also once you memorize the vocabulary on each track follow it by using a note card to cover the words that you have just memorized
And test yourself and follow that by going back and using this same note card technique on the tracks you studied during the previous days
This repetition technique will assist you in mastering these words in order to provide you with the tools to create your own sentences
Every day use this no card technique on the words that you have just studied
Everything in life has a catch
The catch here is just consistency
If you just open the book and after the first few tracks of studying the program you put it down then you will not gain anything
If you consistently dedicate a half hour daily to studying as well as reviewing what you have learned from previous days
Then you will quickly realize why this method is the most effective technique ever created to become conversational in a foreign language
My technique works
For anyone who doubts this technique all I can say is that it has worked for me and hundreds of others
Note from the author
Thank you for your interest in my work
I encourage you to share your overall experience of this book by posting a review
Your review can make a difference
Please feel free to describe how you benefited from my method or provide creative feedback on how I can improve this program
I am constantly seeking ways to enhance the quality of this product
Based on personal testimonials and suggestions from individuals like you
Thanks and best of luck
