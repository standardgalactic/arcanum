welcome to the active podcast where we will present short digestible segments clipped from
the active inference lab weekly live streams if you like what you hear and you want to learn more
check out the entire live stream at the active inference lab youtube channel the link to the
live stream is provided in the episode description after cutting last week's episode i decided that
i'm throwing out my podcast introduction script at least while we continue to discuss scripts so by
now you probably know that i'm blue knight and this week we're going to discuss the same paper
we talked about last week a variational approach to scripts as usual daniel is going to scaffold
our discussion enjoy oh again maybe what would you summarize this or i'm also just curious like
when you present it to different contexts or audiences so when you're in front of audience a versus b
let's say what are two different ways that you talk about what you're doing so yes my name is
i'm one of the authors on the paper along with axel constant maxwell ramsted and carl friston i'm a
first year phd student in quebec and i'm working in cognitive computing i i mean i tend to present
it pretty straightforwardly to anyone because it's it's very simple it's essentially just saying that
um we behave in ways that are predictable because our cognition about the world and our position in the
world is also predictable through a bayesian framework most of our cognition is not perfect but
then that definitely bayesian and so the beauty of active inference is that it gives us a way to
model the different ways in which our cognition can be slightly biased or um let's say not classically
logical but definitely following a gradient of optimization towards x and this x is like minimization of
uh free energy so through the scripts that are both um let's say simple and more formal so scripts that are
um weaker so semantic fields and stronger so behavioral links between some of the semantic elements
we can essentially predict the behavior and the thought process of anyone as long as we have
information about their position in the world cool and if i could just build a little bit on that
it's kind of like the scripts are archetypes or patterns that play out on landscapes and that's kind of like
water on a landscape and the landscape in this case is like a landscape of affordances a field of affordances
that's things that we've talked about but it's also potentially quantitatively a landscape of free
energy minimization or there are entities that we can model as if they're doing optimization in a
variational bayesian framework on some landscape that we're also inferring about as investigators and then
just like water on the landscape there might be a marsh where there's a lot of ways to go and it's
not quite clear it's very flat there might be other parts that are like the grand canyon where if you're
in the canyon you're totally in the canyon and if you're not you're totally not and so that would be
like a very strong script in the grand canyon and then a marsh or like a floodplain would be like a
weak script so that's one dimension and then the other dimension which we're going to come back to
is this internalist versus externalist so we'll get to that in a second but that's another
dimension about how active inference can integrate scripts let's talk about these two dimensions of
script variability now just you know so much more about scripts than us um where are some
examples of some of scripts that people might recognize or where has this been an especially
contentious debate or is there a difference between field a and field b like a disagreement that
stems from one having an externalist perspective and one having internalist perspective
well it's it's not so much in disagreement it's just that um depending on what your paradigm is
you'll tend to focus on externalism and another paradigm you'll tend to focus on internalism like
for instance behaviorism could never have gone to an internalist perspective because it literally
tries to evacuate anything that happens inside cognition it's like what's the input and the output so this
would be fundamentally externalist um social uh social studies will tend to to move through externalist
perspectives because they don't necessarily also have access to what the perception from the individual
is of a certain of a certain fact all you have is movements of demographics and and how these movies
manifest in the world so of course it's never as simple as that there's always internalist elements and
externalist conceptions and externalist conceptions elements and internalist conceptions but it's
it's where you tend to focus in our paper we're showing that active inference allows us to bring both
together because the generative model is a model of you and the world and the beauty of this is through
the work of axel constant and samuel we can see that the world also has a model of you so we have
this dual connection that's possible through internalism and externalism um the good example
of an external script is institutions uh you you you have to go through certain um passages in order
to get something you have to have a passport to go to another country and any uh an internalist script
is well how do i want to dress up for something tonight do i know what to wear am i going to wear
something it's it's it's probable that i'll get in the club if i wear xyz and there's some clubs that
would stop me from going into the club if i don't wear the proper clothes this is both an internal
script that i have as an expectation of what the club will allow me to do given xyz the weak script is
we have some clusters of categories so um i know that some colors go with some things i know that some
words are appropriate in some places and some words are not appropriate in other places but i don't
necessarily know the order of the words or i don't necessarily know the order of the colors or like
i can wear pink up here and yellow down here or yellow and pink there's no necessary order or structure
to what i have to do so long as i stay within these clusters a strong script is when you go to a wedding
there's a series of events that will happen only one person wears white etc etc so like it's way
stricter as to where each element of the semantic clusters happen to fall both in time and in space
cool thanks for that rj my name is rj corday uh i'm in new york and i'm currently researching
organizational dynamics intelligence analysis and narrative warfare uh thank you for that explanation
uh because i i i when i first read the paper i was thinking that it's not so much disagreement as
much as it is uh the way that the priors that different fields are using when they're approaching
the subject and the subjects that they're studying so like when i thought about it was like externalist
weak maybe is like io psychology where it's a strong function of the organizational culture it's much
but and then maybe external it's external is strong um would be closer to maybe maybe in the realm
of geopolitics where it's looking at like procedures after after regime changes so yeah
yep and also the way um i've thought about this like internalist and externalist is that there's
very little disagreement on what is for example people can say yes there's a virus particle that
consists of lipids and protein and their society and people are moving around but then somebody who
writes a review paper from the perspective of a protein biologist they're going to focus on the
proteins and so it shouldn't be too surprising that because of their regime of attention and their
knowledge affordances they're going to recommend some type of molecular binding agent whereas somebody
who studies it from the sociological perspective knows that the proteins exist but then they're going
to highlight different features and therefore going to make different recommendations it would just be
off key if somebody wrote a sociological review paper and then went into a conclusion about
a protein binding molecule so that's something that we need to really understand that we're all at the
same table but it's our different perspectives that can either divide or integrate us now
yes so what you're bringing is really important is the salience of causal links so the beauty of
vector inference is that it allows us to draw um causal chains right or at least what we believe is the
inference in in regard to the causal chains where you come from defines what is salient in order to get
to a goal so that's why scripts are not just like a point here and you get there however you want
right that's that would be a very very very weak version of the script and anyone who is in the mark
of blanket of where anyone tries to get to this point that's that's a very weak script but a strong
script is well in order to get to this point there's x element that is salient um as you said earlier if if
someone comes from a different field and tells you no no the important causal chain is through
externalist things it doesn't matter what's inside your mind that's behaviorism right they would say
it doesn't matter what you think what happens is if you don't do it you won't go through and
internalists will be well it doesn't matter if you go through what matters is how you act into the world
but um you're right in pointing out that if you're we're all at the same table we have to realize that
they're both of these things are kind of true what really matters is how they causally interact to get
to um a final product a final point great point and here's something to add on that is within active
inference we talk about causal inference uh the latent causes in the world as our hypotheses about the system
and so if one person hypothesizes that there's a causal link and somebody else says i think it's
not as important as you think it is or i think something else is more important then what we can
say is instead of getting into an inference duel we can get into an active inference collaboration
where we say great well given your hypothesis about the causal network in mind what's the optimal
experiment that we can do and optimal experimentation entails an ethical structure nobody says well my
optimal experiment is that we're going to move a thousand people to mars and we're going to test
them with this device that's not it's not tractable and it's not within our affordances and it's not
ethical so then we can say that's actually not in the distribution of experiments we're going to consider
we're going to downweight that family of experiments and so we can come to the table and ask what is
going to be the most informative experiment that we can collaborate on specifically to reduce our uncertainty
about our shared world our shared niche interesting stuff now that's exactly right like we can come up
with new models of governance through this by understanding that it doesn't have to be a zero
sum game it can literally be a productive game where we're just optimizing through the the world of
possibles that overlap and that are meaningful for everyone involved so if you could model i'm being
i'm being a little optimistic here but if you could model everyone's scripts and we could model a shared
understanding of what would be a um a desired state of the world which would be like rg we we have this g
then we can find the policies that optimize for um our our sets of constraints that's just that's just
beautiful right there we hope you enjoyed this episode stay tuned for next time where we're gonna
