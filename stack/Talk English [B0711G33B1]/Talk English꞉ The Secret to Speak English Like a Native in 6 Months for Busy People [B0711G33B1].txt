Talk English.
The secret to speak English like a native in six months for busy people.
Written by Ken Chow.
Narrated by Scott P. Delaney.
Editor's Word.
Before having read the book, my expectations of its effectiveness were neutral.
I wasn't sure if the six-month plan that would be set forth by the author would be a realistic timeline for an individual's learning needs.
Regardless, I dove in with a completely open mind, and almost immediately came to realize that my doubts were unfounded.
The book's main promise was that it would provide its readers with a plan that would transform their broken English into fluent English.
After having read this piece, I can say without a doubt that the book went above and beyond its initial promise to deliver so much more.
Ken outlined a meticulously detailed regimen that not only explained everything one would have to do in order to improve his or her English,
including numerous original strategies and helpful tips,
but he also took on the role of an encourager, cheering his reader on throughout the whole read.
Certainly, this book went above and beyond to deliver much more than its original promise.
It delivered a lifestyle change.
The strategies that the author has outlined can be applied universally to any language,
and I would recommend this book to anyone who would like to improve his or her fluency in a foreign language,
most specifically, English, as this is what the author focuses on.
This is the book every English learner needs to read.
What sets this book apart from the myriad of others is the way in which the author connects with his reader.
From his words, you can absolutely feel the suffering he experienced as a result of his broken English
and the triumph that overwhelmed him when he finally succeeded at communicating fluently.
This book is thoughtful and inspiring, and its genuine tone will deeply touch its readers.

Forward
There are so many books, specifically help books, out on the market,
that one can get so overwhelmed with the selection.
This book, Catering to the English Language Fluency, is such a great book that there is no need to even scratch your head over the others.
Ken does an incredible job at making it easy to read and understand,
precise and specific in teaching you what to do to better your English,
and most important, he makes it personal.
With the personal touch, you can really fall deep into the emotions, the battles and the triumphs of Ken's journey.
He takes you into a place where you can really relate to him,
and that makes learning so much easier, and more fun.
I myself am not an American native.
I was born in the Czech Republic and came to the USA at the age of four with my parents.
Now, as a young child, I picked up the English language quite fast.
However, my parents did not.
As adults, of course, it's much more difficult to learn a second language,
let alone English, which is not that easy.
They took English as a Second Language courses at a local community college
and watched easy-to-understand TV shows,
which was all fine and helped them learn the language,
but if they had Ken's book at that time, back in the 1980s,
they really would have scored.
Ken is eager and excited to get this book in your hands.
He trusts that his tips and techniques will help you,
just as they did him.
I believe that you will find this book extremely valuable and helpful,
and hope you enjoy it as much as I did.

Benjamin Disraeli
A middle school dropout can?
Can you?
In a poor farming village in southern China,
a child was born.
In his childhood life,
he was hungry.
So hungry,
that even after over 30 years,
he still remembers the hunger he'd been through in vivid details.
There was no running water,
so he had to carry water home from a well
that was half a kilometer away,
using two buckets.
And he was seven years old.
The buckets of water were so heavy
that he couldn't walk straight.
At age seven,
he started to work in the fields
to plant,
cultivate,
and harvest crops.
At age seven,
he started to collect firewood for cooking.
At age seven,
he started to cook for the entire family,
using open fire.
There was no electric stove,
and he was lucky
if he got electricity for lighting once a week.
He started elementary school at age eight
and dropped out of middle school at age 13.
He moved to America with his family when he was 17.
He spoke no English,
went straight to high school,
and started to learn English
in classes called English as Second Language,
ESL classes.
Since he spoke no English,
English certainly wasn't his favorite subject.
At age 20,
he could speak some broken English.
Then he used a method
which I'm about to share with you
to improve his English fluency.
And six months later,
he turned his broken English
into fluent English.
In the following effortless practices,
he even turned his English
into an English
that people who didn't know him
thought was his native language.
Amazing, isn't it?
And here is the best part.
This country boy,
this middle school dropout,
started at 20,
for six months,
who successfully spoke English like a native,
has no special talent.
He's just an average person
you and I would see in the countryside.
He's just an average person
you and I would meet on the streets.
This middle school dropout
is talking right in front of you.
This middle school dropout
is me.
And yes,
I,
Ken Chow,
a country boy,
a middle school dropout,
an average man,
started at 20,
for six months,
can speak English like a native.
There is one sole purpose
I'm putting my humble background here.
Inspiration.
Because with a background like that,
and I can still make me speak English
like a native,
can you?
What I used to make me speak English
like a native
was my fluent English formula.
It's a formula I created,
improved,
and perfected.
Using the same formula,
I also made me speak
two other languages like a native.
If a country boy,
a middle school dropout,
an average man with no special talent,
started at age 20,
for six months,
can make him speak English like a native,
my friend,
yes,
you can.
Let's start the six-month journey today
to get your results.
To your success.
Ken Zhao.
We'll either find a way
or make one.
Hannibal.
Two.
From broken English
to fluent English.
When I was 20,
I could understand some English,
but not much.
My vocabulary was very limited,
my accent was very strong,
and I first thought in my language,
then translated into my own version of English
to speak to people.
The problem was,
people couldn't understand me.
In short,
my English was bad.
What kind of jobs could I get
if I could only speak
translated,
broken English
with a strong accent?
That inspired me
to start looking for opportunities
to improve my English fluency.
One day,
I watched an advertisement on TV
and saw an expert called
Fluent English Mr. Wang
who guaranteed English fluency.
He guaranteed that
if you were just starting
to learn English
and took lessons from him
for a year,
your English would be more fluent
than others
who'd learned English
for 10 years.
How amazing is that?
I thought.
But there was a problem.
Fluent English Mr. Wang
only offered to teach
one-on-one private lessons,
but I didn't have the money.
By the way,
a private lesson at the time
was $30 per hour.
I wondered
what Fluent English
Mr. Wang did
to get that kind of result,
but I didn't call him
because I thought
he wouldn't tell me anyways.
Then I thought,
if he can find a way to do it,
I can find a way to do it too.
So I started by reading books
from the library
on English fluency.
All of the books
I intentionally picked
were written by native speakers
because I thought
I should learn
from the native.
There were lots of words
I didn't know,
but I looked them up
in the dictionary.
After I read about 10 books,
I summarized all of the strategies
into a list of 10.
The strategies were something like
listen, listen, listen,
read, read, read,
use what you've learned,
build your vocabulary,
and so on.
I started applying
these strategies,
and I could understand
a little more English,
but the strategies
didn't make me speak
any better.
So I kept reading books,
and again,
all were written
by native speakers,
but they all said
pretty much the same things.
I kept reading and reading.
As far as I can remember,
I read a total
of about 60 books,
and again,
all of the books
I intentionally picked
were written
by native speakers,
and all of the books
said almost the same things.
The strategies
were ineffective,
so I tried
a different approach.
Instead of picking books
written by native speakers,
all the books
I picked this time
were written
by successful,
non-native English speakers
who had made
their English fluent.
I picked up
and read
about 10 of them.
To my surprise,
all the books
said the same things
as the 60 books
written by native speakers
except for one thing.
Repeat what you hear
again and again.
Repeat what you hear
again and again
wasn't mentioned
in any of the 60 books
written by native speakers
at all.
Out of the list
of 60 books
written by native speakers,
one was very useful.
This book
wasn't about
how to speak
fluent English.
Instead,
it was about
how to become successful,
written by Tony Robbins.
I came across that book
and wondered
for three seconds
of whether or not
to take it.
At the last moment,
I decided to take it
just to take a peek at it
in case there were
something useful.
To my surprise,
it turned out
to be a great book
on how to set goals
and how to become successful.
I summarized that book
and the 10 books
written by the successful
non-native English speakers
and came up
with one strategy,
a strategy I later named
My Fluent English Formula.
The Perfect Opportunity
I was 20 at the time,
living in the Brooklyn area
of New York City.
Every day,
I took the subway trains
to and from Manhattan.
The trip took 40 minutes
each way on the train.
The walk to the train station
from home took 12 minutes
and the walk from the train station
to work took 5 minutes.
All added together,
a round trip
took an hour and 54 minutes
each day.
That created
a perfect opportunity
for me.
I brought my walkman
with me while on the way
to work
and on the way home.
I normally listened
to English lessons
and sometimes songs,
but after I read
the last 10 books
written by non-native speakers
and worked out
my strategy,
I used the walkman
to try my new strategy.
Repeat what you hear
again and again.
Taking Action
During these round trips,
I first tuned in
to a news station.
It was NPR,
National Public Radio,
to listen to the news.
It worked very well
during the 12-minute walk
to the train station,
but once I entered
the train station,
the signal was lost.
When I got home at night,
I recorded the news
on a tape for the next day
so that I could listen
to it on the train.
After that,
I recorded fresh news
every night.
I started by whispering
the news,
but then I began
saying it louder.
New York subway trains
were as noisy as thunders,
and thanks to that,
the noise created
the perfect opportunity
for me to work
on my strategy,
and even the person
sitting next to me
couldn't hear
what I was talking about.
So I got to practice
the entire train ride
both ways.
In the beginning,
there were lots of words
I didn't understand,
but I repeated them anyway.
In the beginning,
the news was too fast for me,
but I repeated what I heard
even if I couldn't catch up.
Often when there was
a word or phrase
I couldn't say,
I would rewind the tape
and listen to it again.
This time,
I only listened to it.
If I still couldn't say it,
I would rewind the tape again
and listen again
until I could say it.
Then I would repeat
the new word or phrase
once,
twice,
three times,
until I could correctly say
the new word or phrase.
It helped a lot.
The next time I heard
that same word or phrase,
I could correctly say it.
Following through
Three months later,
I decided to record
my own speaking
to see how much
I had improved,
because I had heard
some people,
at least three
that I remembered,
saying that I spoke
good English.
So I wrote down
some daily conversational phrases
and recorded my voice
saying them.
To my surprise,
I did speak
what I wrote down
pretty fluently.
I could still hear
my accent,
but the accent
was much lighter.
Compared to other
ESL learners,
my English
was even better.
I got excited
about the results
and decided
to slightly adjust
my approach.
The first thing
I changed
was recording
the news
once a week,
listening and practicing
the same English
from native speakers
for a whole week.
In the beginning
of the week,
there was almost
always something
I couldn't say.
At the end of the week,
I'd mastered
speaking everything
on the whole tape.
I was even
almost able
to recite
everything on the tape,
including words,
sentences,
tones,
flow.
The next week,
I recorded
a new tape
and did the same thing
for the rest
of the week.
I did it for a month
and mastered
four tapes
of English
taught by native speakers.
On week five,
I went back
to practice
the previous
four weeks' English
with one tape
per day.
For the remaining
days of the week,
I practiced
the tapes
that I had
the hardest time with.
Within a month,
I'd mastered
speaking four tapes
of English
taught all
by native speakers.
Each tape
was 60 minutes long.
Four tapes
were 240 minutes
of English
taught by native speakers.
The result
Three months later,
As you may have guessed,
I recorded
my speaking again
and the results
were surprising.
My accent
was gone,
my voice
was clear,
my pronunciation
was correct,
and my flow
was smooth.
In other words,
my English
was fluent.
It was a total
of six months
that I had spent
practicing my English,
but the result
was overwhelming.
After talking
to a friend
on the phone
for a moment,
the friend
suddenly asked,
What did you do?
I said,
Huh?
What do you mean?
He said,
You're English.
It's good.
I could hear
the word
good
was coming
from his heart.
He said
the word
good
with a tone
that was so sincere
that I could feel
the energy
of his voice.
Two of my cousins,
both native speakers,
asked,
How come
your English
is so good,
but your brothers
and sisters
are not?
The Continuing Effort
I didn't just
stop there.
For the months
and years
that followed,
I continued
to use my strategy
when I found
opportunities,
even though
my situation
had changed.
Years later,
I developed
yet another strategy
I called
Open Throat,
which I'll talk
about in the next chapter.
When speaking English
with the Open Throat
strategy,
my English
sounds absolutely
100% native.
When my son
was in first grade,
he invited me
to read to his class
as a guest reader.
His teacher
was so upset
because I looked
like I couldn't
speak English,
which would mean
disaster to her class.
However,
his teacher
was absolutely
stunned
when I spoke.
I saw her eyes
widen for five seconds
followed by
a long smile.
She watched
quietly
as I inspired
her students
to enjoy the book
by talking
with 100% enthusiasm
and speaking
in 100% native English.
She then suddenly
jumped into action
by whipping out
her camera
and started
taking pictures.
She even interrupted
me by asking
if she could put
a picture
in her class newsletter.
She later asked
if I could participate
more to help her
in her class activities.
3.
How fluent?
One word.
Native.
This is a strategy
which I had later
developed
that brought my fluency
to the next level.
I called it
open throat.
When practicing,
open your throat,
talk with your diaphragm,
and bring the energy
from your stomach.
The energy flow
and the way
of speaking
make a huge difference.
To do this,
you must open
your throat,
let the air
flow through,
and talk with energy
from your stomach.
You should feel
your stomach tighten
when you talk.
So bring your energy
up all the way
from your stomach,
let the air flow
from your lungs
through your throat,
and talk with
your throat open.
After my daughter
joined her school
chorus class,
she told me
that her chorus teacher
taught the class
the following.
Open throat.
Have you ever seen
anyone sing
with their throat?
In other words,
singing like that
is called
singing with a chicken throat.
It's far from good.
How do you like that?
Are you too nervous
to speak English?
Are you too shy
to speak English?
Are you using
chicken throat
to speak English
because you're nervous
or shy?
Because you're afraid
you'll make mistakes
so others may laugh
at you?
Listen to me.
English is a foreign
language to you anyway.
Making mistakes
speaking a foreign
language is very normal.
Instead,
open your throat
to speak English.
Open your throat
and use
my fluent English
formula
to make you
speak English
like a native.
Do that
for six months.
And then,
when you speak
like me,
when you speak
English like a native,
and even native speakers
are scared of you,
who is going
to laugh at you?
It is in the moment
of decision
that your destiny
is shaped.

The formula
to make you
speak English
like a native.
Here is the formula.
It's called
My Fluent English
formula.
My Fluent English
formula
has three steps.
Step 1.
Set your goal.
Step 2.
Take action.
Step 3.
Follow through.
Step 1.
Set your goal.
Setting your goal
is deciding
what you want.
Congratulations!
You've already
decided what you want.
By getting this book,
you're very clear
that your step 1
is to speak English
like a native,
or at least
speak English fluently.
The word
decide
originates
from Greek
and means
to cut off from.
Once you've decided
on what you want,
that's it.
You cut off
from any other
possibility
and focus
only on what
you've decided on.
Decide what you want
is like setting
a target
for you to shoot at.
Clarity
is power.
The more clear
you are
on what you want,
the more precise
your brain
takes you
to your target.
You must know
exactly what you want
so that you know
exactly where to go.
When I used
my fluent English
formula
to learn
to speak English,
I decided
that I wanted
to speak
fluent English.
With the target
set in place,
I started working
to reach the target.
I worked
only on my
spare times,
but with a target
set in sight,
I aimed
at the target
and knew
exactly where
to go.
If you decide
to speak fluent
English,
go for it.
If you decide
to speak English
like a native,
go for it.
These are
very clear
targets.
Once you've
decided on
exactly what
you want,
it's critical
that you continue
focusing on
your target.
That's
focusing
on your target.
The key word
is focusing.
You haven't
shot any arrows
at your target yet.
Step one
is just
setting your target
in place.
In review,
your target
is what you want.
What you want
is your target.
With that in mind,
you're now ready
to take step two.
Step two
Take action
Once you have
set your target
in place,
you'll need
to take out
your bow
and arrows
and shoot
at your target.
Once you have
decided on
what you want,
you'll need
to get what
you want.
To get what
you want,
you'll have
to take action.
It does not
matter what
we can do.
It does matter
what we will
do.
After you
set your target,
in order to
get any result,
you'll have
to shoot
at your target.
Look at me
in these two
situations.
One
If I can
speak English
like a native
speaker,
I have a
college degree
in information
technology,
I have a
graduate degree
in space
studies,
I live
in the
United States
of America,
a free
society
where everything
is possible.
With all
of these
potential powers,
I can
do a lot
of things,
but if I
do not
do anything,
nothing will
happen.
Two
If I
speak
broken
English,
I don't
have money
for private
lessons,
I don't
have much
time to
learn English.
With all
of these
restrictions,
I can't
do a lot
of things
to speak
fluent
English,
but if I
will do
something to
speak fluent
English,
I will
still achieve
some fluency.
In fact,
with all
these
restrictions,
I did
something and
made me
speak English
like a
native.
It's not
what we are
capable of
that makes
things happen.
It's what
we will
do that
makes things
happen.
When I
was 20,
I knew
I wanted
to speak
fluent
English,
and I
took
action
to improve
my
English,
and I
did get
excellent
results.
My
action
got me
exactly
what I
wanted.
So take
action
to get
what you
want.
Literally,
get going
to get
what you
want.
I'll
show you
step-by-step
instructions
of what
action
to take.
Step
three.
Follow
through.
Once
you've
decided
on what
you
want,
and
you're
taking
action
to do
what
you
want,
keep
working
on it.
Follow
through
until you
succeed.
Making
you speak
English like
a native
is a job
that takes
more than
a day
to do.
Keep
taking
action
day-by-day
to get
there.
Start
small,
and keep
building
your
fluency
little
by
little,
day
by
day.
Let's
look at
this
example.
If you
want to
lift
300
pounds,
can
you
lift
300
pounds?
How
about
3
pounds?
Can
you
lift
3
pounds?
Yes.
You
can
start
by
lifting
3
pounds
a
day,
day
by
day,
every
day.
You
keep
increasing
the
amount
of
weight
little
by
little,
day
by
day.
Before
you
know
it,
what
seemed
impossible
before
is
already
possible.
You've
already
built
enough
muscle
to
effortlessly
lift
300
pounds.
When
I
started
to
improve
my
English,
I
started
by
taking
one
single
action.
The
next
day,
I
took
one
more
action.
I
kept
taking
the
same
action
day
by
day.
After
three
months,
I
had
already
built
enough
fluency
that
people
started
telling
me
that
my
English
was
good.
I
followed
through
by
building
my
fluency
little
by
little,
day
by
day.
After
another
three
months,
I
started
to
speak
what
seemed
impossible
before,
fluent
English.
If
you
build
your
fluency
by
just
one
percent
a
day
and
keep
building
on
it,
imagine
what
your
fluency
will be
like
six
months
later.
You
could
have
built
enough
fluency
to speak
English
that
seemed
impossible
before.
Let's
review the
MyFluent
English
formula.
The MyFluent
English
formula
has
three
steps.
Step
one.
Set
your
goal.
Step
two.
Take
action.
Step
three.
Follow
through.
Life
is
either
a
daring
adventure
or
nothing.

The
one
word
secret.
Now
that you
know
the
formula,
it's
time to
learn
what
to
do
to
speak
English
like
a
native.
Let's
take
a look
at
this.
You
want
to
learn
Kung
Fu
so
that
you
can

people.
You've
watched

You've
also
watched
how

people.
You
know
the
skills
you
need
to
know
to
beat
ten
people.
Now
you're
facing
ten
people.
Can
you
beat
them?
The
answer
is
obvious.
If
you
want
to
beat
ten
people,
just
knowing
how
will
not
let
you
beat
them.
In
order
to
beat
them,
you'll
have
to
practice
your
Kung
Fu.
You'll
need
to
build
up
your
muscles,
harden
stretch
your
legs,
aim
your
kicks.
You
need
to
get
your
mind
mentally
ready
and
your
bodily
mechanisms
physically
ready
to
beat
ten
people.
In
order
to
do
that,
what
you
need
to
do
is
one
word,
practice.
practice.
The
same
thing
applies
to
speaking
English.
If
you
want
to
speak
English
like
a
native,
just
knowing
how
to
speak
will
not
get
you
there.
You'll
have
to
practice
speaking
English.
I
mean
literally
practice
speaking
English
over
and
over
again.
You
need
to
open
your
throat,
relax
your
tongue,
loosen
your
muscles,
control
your
flow.
You
need
to
get
your
mind
mentally
ready
and
your
bodily
mechanisms
physically
ready
to
speak
English
like
a
native.
In
order
to
do
that,
what
you
need
to
do
is
one
word,
practice.
There
are
many
places
where
you
can
practice.
I
highly
recommend
you
use
all
of
them
whenever
possible.
On
the
train.
If
you
take
the
train
to
work,
congratulations,
I
hope
your
train
is
loud
so
you
can
follow
my
exact
footsteps,
because
if
your
train
is
too
quiet,
people
will
look
at
you.
When
I
practiced
on
the
train,
I
found
a
corner
seat
to
sit
down.
You
can
do
the
same.
Find
a
corner
seat
and
practice
your
English.
You
should
speak
out
loud.
You
should
not
whisper,
because
whispering
will
get
you
a
different
result,
and
that's
not
the
result
you
want.
In
this
digital
age,
you
are
lucky.
You
can
take
out
your
cell
phone,
put
on
your
headphones,
and
practice
just
like
you
would
on
the
phone.
The
person
sitting
next
to
you
will
think
you
are
talking
on
the
phone.
On
the
bus.
If
you
take
the
bus
to
work,
congratulations.
Your
bus
won't
be
too
loud,
so
it
won't
damage
your
hearing.
Still,
try
to
speak
like
you
normally
would,
because
whispering
will
get
you
a
different
result.
Whispering
will
train
your
tongue
and
lips,
but
will
not
train
your
throat,
your
diaphragm,
stomach,
tone,
volume,
and
airflow.
Remember,
though,
in order
to be
fluent,
you'll
have to
practice
in other
places
where you
can speak
out loud.
In
the
car.
This
is,
by far,
my
favorite
place
to
practice
my
English.
There
is a
lot
of
freedom
in
the
car,
and
you
can
go
full
throttle
when
practicing.
When
I
later
got
the
chance
to
practice
in
the
car,
I
practiced
everything
I
heard.
Since
the
car
was
much
quieter
than
the
train
and
no
one
was
sitting
next
to
me,
I
turned
up
the
volume
and
followed
what
I
heard
with
the
exact
same
tones,
exact
same
volumes,
exact
same
airflow,
exact
same
speed,
exact
same
expressions,
exact
same
everything.
In
addition,
I
got
to
use
my
hands
to
help
me
express
my
feelings.
I
always
closed
the
windows
so
that
people
on
the
street
wouldn't
be
able
to
hear
me.
Occasionally,
I
saw
people
on
the
street
looking
at
me
puzzled.
Today,
you're
lucky.
When
people
on the
street
look
at
you,
they
will
just
think
you're
just
talking
on
the
phone.
So,
in
short,
when
practicing
in
the
car,
phones,
exact
same
volumes,
exact
same
airflow,
exact
same
speed,
exact
same
expressions,
exact
same
everything
at
full
speed.
I
do
want
to
stress,
though,
it's
speaking
you should
go
full
speed
on,
not
driving.
So,
drive
safe.
At
home.
Do
you
cook
at
home?
I
know
I
do.
I
started
cooking
for
the
family
since
I
was
seven,
so
I'm
very
good
at
it.
I
even
taught
my
wife
how
to
cook,
since
she
never
cooked
before
she
married
me.
For
me,
cooking
normally
takes
10
minutes
for
breakfast
and
40
minutes
for
dinner.
That's
50
minutes
a
day.
When
doing
cooking,
your
brain
is
free,
and
it's
a
perfect
time
to
practice.
This
is
a
real
good
time
to
put
on
your
headphones
and
practice.
Outdoor
Outdoor
activities
such as
running,
jogging,
walking,
hiking,
and shopping
can also
be great
opportunities
for
practicing.
At
work
I
worked at
the
Boeing
company
for
two
years
where
I
often
worked
at
the
aircraft
building
factory.
The
factory
was
very
noisy,
and
everyone
must
wear
ear
plugs
in
the
assembly
areas.
I
used
this
as
an
excellent
opportunity
to
practice.
I
put
on
my
noise
cancelling
headphones
and
practiced
as
loud
as
I
wanted
and
no
one
could
hear
me.
Is
your
workplace
a
good
place
to
practice?
How
many
hours
do
you
work
a
day?
If
you
can
put
your
work
hours
to
good
use,
you
can
skyrocket
your
results.
Get
it
right,
baby.
The
successful
warrior
is the
average
man
with

Carefully
choosing
the
correct
materials
is the
key to
your
success.
The
materials
you
choose
determine
whether
you
will
speak
good
English,
bad
English,
right
English,
or wrong
English.
I
would
like
you
to
see
this
very
clearly.
The
pronunciations
of
British
English
and
American
English
are
different.
If
you
want
to
speak
like
a
native,
you
want
to
speak
like
a
native
of
what?
A
native
of
what?
You
can't
mix
the
two
accents
if
you
want
to
speak
like
a
native.
You
must
pick
only
one
to
learn.
Either
one
is
fine,
but
you
must
pick
one.
Pick
one,
stick
with
it,
and
leave
the
other
one
alone.
You
can
go
back
to
the
other
one
after
you
speak
one
like
a
native.
Before
you
speak
like
a
native,
focus
on
one.
In
other
words,
if you
want
to
learn
to
speak
British
English
like
a
native,
pick
all
materials
in
British
English.
Likewise,
if
you
want
to
learn
to
speak
American
English
like
a
native,
pick
all
materials
in
American
English.
Pick
one
language,
British
or
American,
and stick
with it.
There are
two boats
you can
catch.
Each boat
will get
you to
a different
destination,
but you
can only
sit on
one boat
at a
time.
So pick
a boat
and get
on it.
You want
to speak
English like
a native,
right?
Listen to
the
expert.
Pick
one.
You can
understand
the other
one perfectly
well,
but to
speak
like a
native,
you must
pick
one
and
only
one.
Remember
what
Bruce Lee
said?
Focus.
If
unfocused,
your
laser beam
is not
strong enough
to melt
snow,
but if
focused,
your
laser beam
is strong
enough to
cut
steel.
Take
three
seconds to
think of
which
accent to
learn and
then
continue
listening.
Now that
you have
chosen your
language,
it's time to
choose the
right materials.
Think of
it this
way.
If you
choose
materials in
which someone
is speaking
native English,
you'll learn
to speak
native English.
If you
choose
materials in
which someone
is speaking
incorrect
English,
you'll learn
to speak
incorrect
English.
If you
choose
materials in
which native
speakers are
speaking English
in real-life
situations,
you'll learn
to speak
real-life
English.
If you
choose
materials in
which native
speakers are
speaking English
in unrealistic
situations,
you'll learn
to speak
unrealistic
English.
I remember
listening to
a tape
which a
friend was
introducing a
friend to
another friend.
The conversation
was like
this.
Mr.
Wong,
this is
Mr.
Chen,
Bill Chen.
Mr.
Chen,
this is
Mr.
Wong,
Dan Wong.
How do
you do?
It's my
pleasure to
meet you.
Me too.
This
conversation
from an
old recorded
lesson was
perfectly correct
in English
grammar,
and the
people participating
in the
conversation
were native
English speakers.
However,
this is
wrong,
very wrong.
Native
English speakers
don't speak
this way.
This makes
people feel
awkward and
uncomfortable,
and the
atmosphere is
filled with
restrictions.
Essentially,
the conversation
would be
unnatural.
In the
real world,
the conversation
would be
like this.
Dan,
meet Bill.
How's it
going,
Bill?
How's
going,
Dan?
Notice the
how's
going,
but not
how's
it going.
This is
the actual
conversation
native speakers
use when
meeting new
people.
This is a
casual,
informal
conversation
that native
speakers feel
comfortable to
take part
in.
So,
if you have
lessons from
English
instructional
textbooks or
recordings that
are not
performed by
native speakers
speakers or
are not
about real
life situations,
put them
away.
Choose
something that
people actually
do use.
Choose these
materials.
All materials
performed only
by native
speakers.
All English
must be
naturally spoken
in real life
situations.
Pick all
materials in
one accent,
British English
English or
American
English.
Again,
learn one
language and
only one
language.
Either one
is fine.
Here are some
right materials
to use.
News.
Yes,
news.
Two good
examples are
BBC News and
NPR News.
These are real
life situations
reported to you
in direct,
clear,
and easy to
understand
English.
Learning
Sites
For British
English,
BBC Learning
is an
excellent choice.
For American
English,
Voice of America
Learning is an
excellent one.
Audio Story
Books
This is by
far my
favorite source.
Listen to
stories with
lots of
action.
There,
you can pick up
English vocabulary
words very
quickly.
Pick all
audio story
books written
by native
writers and
read by native
speakers.
You can get a
free copy of
an audio book
on Amazon.
Movies
With pictures,
movies are
easy to
understand.
Your choice
of your favorite
materials,
performed by
native speakers
in real-life
situations.
7.
This is your
right-hand
man.
When I
practiced my
English,
I didn't
spend a
dime.
I used
the Walkman
and a
pair of
cheap
headphones
that I
already
had.
Today,
you're
lucky.
You can
use your
cell phone
and a
pair of
cheap
headphones.
If you
drive a
car,
link up
your
cell phone
with your
car via
Bluetooth
and use
the speakers
of the
car.
If you
don't have
a cell
phone,
that's
fine.
You can
use an
MP3
player or
other
playing
devices.
When I
practiced my
English on
subway trains,
the subway
trains were
so loud that
I turned up
the volume in
order to
hear what
was playing.
I remember
so clearly
that I
turned the
volume up
to 10
and the
highest volume
on that
Walkman
was 10.
In
noisy areas,
a pair of
noise-canceling
headphones is
a good
choice since
turning the
volume up
too high can
damage your
hearing.
There are
two new
headphones
available today.
One is
over-the-ear
noise-canceling
headphones and
the other is
in-ear
isolation
headphones.
These
headphones are
good only
for noisy
areas.
It's best
to use
regular
headphones
or no
headphones.
Over-the-ear
noise-canceling
headphones filter
out what you
don't want to
hear and let
you hear what
you do want
to hear at
low volume.
The headphones
detect outside
noise and
generate sound
waves in the
opposite frequency,
flattening the
outside noise,
making it
inaudible to
you.
I own a
pair of
Audio-Technica
headphones I
bought on
Amazon.
These
headphones can
block off
about 70%
of background
noise, making
my audio clear
enough to keep
the volume low
even in noisy
areas.
I've also
checked out a
pair of high-end
Bose headphones
that were
described as
much better in
performance.
According to
the report,
the headphones can
block off about
90% of
background noise.
However, these
headphones cost
three times as
much as the
Audio-Technica
headphones.
I've also
tried a pair
of low-end
headphones that
a co-worker
had at
Boeing.
The price was
$30 cheaper
than my
Audio-Technica
headphones, but
the quality was
bad.
It only blocked
off about
40-50% of
background noise.
In-ear
isolation
headphones are
small, light,
and easy to
take with you.
They're good for
outdoor activities.
These headphones
are, by far,
cheaper than
over-the-ear
noise-canceling
headphones.
Make sure you
hear me.
Use these
noise-canceling
headphones or
noise-isolation
headphones only
if you absolutely
need them.
You can
practice much
better without
headphones or
with a pair
of regular
headphones because
you can speak
much better if
you can hear
what you say.
Nature has
placed mankind
under the
governance of
two sovereign
masters,
pain and
pleasure.
It is for
them alone to
point out what
we ought to do
as well as to
determine what
we shall do.
Jeremy Bentham

The Step-by-Step
Instructions
Let's make you
speak like a
native.
Let's review.
My Fluent
English Formula
has three
steps.
Step 1.
Set your
goal.
Step 2.
Take action.
Step 3.
Follow through.
Concerning all
acts of
initiative and
creation, there
is one
elementary truth,
that the
moment one
definitely commits
oneself, then
divine providence
moves too.
William Hutchinson
Murray
Let's do
Step 1.
Set your
goal.
If there is
only one thing
that you want
to take from
this book,
this is it.
Yes, this is
the single
most important
thing in this
entire book.
Let's continue.
Step 1.
Set your
goal.
Set a
solid goal,
a stone
goal,
an iron
goal,
a strong
goal,
a goal that
will get you
going,
a goal that
will push you
forward,
a goal that
will burn your
desire to make
you speak English
like a native.
There are two
effective ways to
set your goal,
inspiration and
desperation.
For me, it was
easy.
What kind of jobs
could I get if I
could only speak
translated, broken
English with a
strong accent?
That was it.
I didn't want to
work in a restaurant
doing labor work
for life.
My uncle already
found me a job
working as an
assistant chef in
the restaurant he
worked.
For me, it was
desperation.
If I don't do
anything about my
broken English, I'd
be doing labor work
for life.
But, if I improve
my English and
speak English
fluently, I'd be
doing office work
and live a much
more comfortable
life.
That was a small
reason, but it
was a strong enough
reason to push me
forward.
What is yours?
Here are some
examples of
inspiration.
I have a much
better background
than Ken.
If he can make
him speak English
like a native, I
can make me speak
English like a
native.
I will make me
speak English like
a native.
Let me take
action now.
If Ken, a
country boy, a
middle school dropout,
started at age 20,
for six months, can
speak English like
a native, I can
definitely speak
English like a
native.
I will make me
speak English like
a native in six
months, period.
Here are some
examples of
desperation.
If I keep
speaking English
like this, I'm
going to be doing
labor work for
life.
But, if I speak
English like a
native, I'm going
to live a
comfortable life.
If I don't speak
English like a
native, I'm never
going to get that
dream job.
But, if I speak
English like a
native, not only
will I get that
dream job, I'll
have enough money
to move out of
this apartment and
buy that house on
top of the hill.
For desperation, you
need to have two
parts to make it
work.
Part one, the
pain you have if
you don't speak
English well.
And, part two, the
pleasure you'll get
if you speak
English well.
When you have
these two parts, your
goal works extremely
well.
Use whatever you can
think of that will
inspire you.
Use whatever you can
think of that you
desperately need.
Write down your
goal.
Yes, write it
down.
Write down your
goal and put it
somewhere you can
see it very often.
Write down your
goal and look at it
as often as you
can.
I wrote down my
goals and placed
them on the ceiling
in my bedroom right
above my bed.
I also put a copy on
the wall beside my
bed.
I also put a copy on
my desk.
I also put a copy in
my wallet.
Put your goal in
places where you can
see them as often
as possible.
The point here is
for you to look at
your goal as often
as possible to
remind you that you
have a goal to
work on.
80-20
This is the golden
rule for success.
80% of your success
depends on your
goal and 20%
on your work.
Once again, if
there is only one
thing that you want
to take from this
book, this is it.
This is the single
most important thing
for your success.
If you have your
80%, there are lots
of different ways for
you to get there.
Without your 80%,
what are you going
to do your other
20% for?
A man got fired
from his company.
He got so mad that
he opened a company
to compete with the
company that fired
him.
The man set a
goal.
Then he worked
toward the goal,
and in just a few
short years, he beat
the company that
fired him.
His company today is
worth $112 billion.
The man's name is
Thomas Watson.
The company is IBM.
A man got fired from his
company.
He set a goal to open
his own business.
He sent an application
and a business plan to
a bank for a
£100,000 loan.
The bank asked him to
send 16 copies of his
plan.
He got excited and sent
16 copies of his plan.
He never heard from the
bank again.
So he called the bank.
This is the answer he
got from the bank.
We never wanted to lend
you the money.
We asked for 16 copies of
your plan to show our
employees what a dumb
plan is.
The man tried eight other
banks and all refused to
lend him money.
With a goal set in mind,
he tried the ninth bank,
and he got the loan.
The bank told him that
his plan was a very bad
plan, but the loan was
approved because the loan
officer was going to
retire in two weeks, so
whether or not he could
pay back the loan didn't
matter to him.
The man then set up his
business, and with a goal
in mind, he was incredibly
successful.
He paid back the loan in
full and sold his business
for £47 million.
The company that bought his
business was W.H.
Smith, the company that
fired him.
The man's name is Tim
Waterstone.
The business he opened is
the British bookstore
empire, Waterstones.
Let me say this again.
If there is only one thing
that you want to take from
this book, this is it.
Yes, this is the single
most important thing in
this entire book.
If you haven't read my
background yet, read it
now, because with a humble
background like that, and
I can still set a goal and
successfully made me speak
English like a native, tell
yourself this.
Yes, I can.
There was one simple reason
for me to set a goal that
pushed me forward to learn
to speak like a native.
The more reasons you can
find, the better.
If all you can find is just
one reason, that is enough.
Find a reason why you must
speak English like a native.
Not you want, not you need,
not you should, but you
must.
A reason so strong that you
must do it.
Find that reason now.
Then set your goal.
Deep within man dwell those
slumbering powers, powers that
would astonish him, that he
never dreamed of possessing,
forces that would revolutionize
his life if aroused and put into
action.
Orison Sweatmarden
Let's do step two.
Take action.
To speak English like a native,
you'll need to learn from the
native.
But how to learn from the
native is the key.
In this step, I'm going to
show you how.
Remember the kung fu example I
mentioned earlier?
If you want to be good at kung fu,
you're going to have to practice
kung fu.
If you want to be good at
English, you're going to have to
practice English.
So, how are you going to learn
from the native?
Practice.
I'm going to show you nine
actions to completely get rid of
your accent and make you speak
English just like a native.
So, have your MP3 player or your
cell phone ready.
Put on your headphones if you
need.

Just type either one of the links on
your web browser, and the native study
material will be automatically downloaded
to your computer.
Remember, download only one and leave
the other one alone.
Now, let's take action one.
Action one.
Listen and repeat at the same time.
Listen to this audio, and repeat what you hear
immediately.
I mean immediately, right at the moment you hear it.
I would like to stress the importance of this.
When you hear the beginning of a sentence, you repeat the beginning of a sentence.
When you hear the middle of a sentence, you repeat the middle of the sentence.
When you hear the end of a sentence, you repeat the end of the sentence.
Whenever you hear something, repeat that immediately.
In other words, repeat what you hear as quickly as you can.
What you're doing here is naturally building your fluency.
You're doing this to train your brain, your mouth, your tongue, your lips, your throat,
your lungs, your stomach, and everything you need to naturally speak English without first
translating it.
So just say what you hear immediately.
Let the meaning, the grammar, the vocabulary, and everything else build subconsciously.
In the beginning of your practice, if you hear words you don't know how to say, or words
that are hard to say, that's perfectly fine.
Just try to say the words, or just make some noise and move on.
Action 2.
Finish repeating the whole material.
Listen to and repeat the whole material from the beginning straight to the end.
If you have to pause it, pause it.
When you come back, keep going from where you've left off.
What you're doing here is building your flow, making you speak whole sentences instead of
just words.
So repeat whole sentences and the whole material from the beginning to the end.
Again, if you come across something you can't say correctly, or can't say at all, that's fine.
Just make some noise and move on.
Remember, even if there are words you can't say, keep on going forward.
Continue all the way to the end.
Action 3.
Record your voice.
Yes, record your voice practicing this piece of native study material.
This is crucial.
Do not skip this.
Now you know how to practice the repeating strategy, and you have already repeated this
material once.
At this point, you'll need to record your own voice repeating this same piece of material.
So find a recording device, such as your computer, another cell phone, or other recording device,
and record your voice.
By the way, you'll need to put on a pair of headphones to listen to the native study material
this time, so that you can record your voice clearly.
So listen to the native study material through your headphones this time.
Find a recording device, such as your computer, another cell phone, or other recording device,
and record your voice do the following.
Record your voice repeating the whole material from the beginning to the end.
Repeat everything you know how to say, and make some noise on everything you don't know
how to say.
Just do your best and keep on going forward.
Remember to keep going straight forward until you get to the end.
Save your voice file and leave it alone.
You will listen to it later.
Action 4.
Finish repeating the whole material all at once yet another time.
For the third time, listen to and repeat the same material from the beginning right to
the end.
You want to keep your flow going.
Repeat the full sentences and the whole material.
Repeat everything you know how to say, and make some noise on everything you don't know
how to say.
Just do your best and keep going forward until you reach the end.
Action 5.
Go back and repeat the words you can't say for as many times as you need.
Now that you have listened to and repeated this single file three times and you know the sentence
flow, it's time to listen to and repeat the same thing again.
Yet this time, immediately go back to the words you can't say.
Listen to them again and try to say them again.
Try to say them again and listen to them again.
Try once, twice, three times.
Try as many times as you need until you can say them correctly.
Action 6.
Finish repeating the whole material end times.
Now that you know how to say every word in this piece of native study material, it's time
to practice the whole thing again.
From the beginning to the end, practice saying what you hear for as many times as needed.
Be sure to practice the flow, the tones, the volumes, the expressions, the speed.
Try to practice everything.
Practice this piece of native study material for as many times as you need until you can say
it naturally.
Congratulations for getting this far.
Now it's time to record your voice again, repeating the same piece of native study material.
Take out your recording device and record yourself repeating the very same piece of material
you've been practicing.
Save your voice file.
Now it's time to compare your recordings.
Listen to the first recording first and then listen to the second recording.
How do you like your English in the beginning?
How do you like your English now?
Do you hear any improvement?
If you don't hear any improvement, that's fine.
This piece of native study material may not be a good fit for you, or you may be too good
for this piece of native study material.
Let's move on.
Take action 8.
If you do hear improvement, congratulations, you are speaking better than before.
Let's do even better than that.
Move on.
Is your English as good as the speaker?
If your English is as good as the speaker, good job.
You are beginning to speak like a native.
Keep up the good work.
Let's take action 8.

Let's do step three.
Follow through.
Keep doing step two.
This is step three.
Keep taking action one to eight.
This is how you follow through to get the results you've been waiting for.
Once a month, go back to the previous pieces of native study materials you've practiced before
and try to practice them again.
This is for your retention.
Go back to them and practice them again.
This will help your brain naturally memorize them and your bodily mechanisms naturally speak
them.
Here is something to get excited about.
By taking action one to eight, your brain will naturally process the pronunciation, grammar,
sentence flow, speed, tone, vocabulary, and everything you need to speak like a native
on whatever you practice.
As a result, you'll know exactly how to correctly pronounce English words.
You'll know exactly when to start, when to pause, and when to stop.
You'll know exactly what to say louder, and what to say softer.
You'll know exactly when to speak faster, and when to speak slower.
Just like native speakers would.
This step will bring you the results you've been waiting for.
If there is one word to describe this step, the word is persistence.
Keep building on top of what you've been building to achieve what you want.
By the way, here is a reminder.
Open throat!
That's it.
Follow through, and you will get there.
Reason guides but a small part of man, and the rest obeys feeling, true or false, and passion,
good or bad.
