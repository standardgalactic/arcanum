in the episode description i am blue knight the host and curator of this episode which is clipped
from live stream number 13.1 this discussion is based on the 2020 paper entitled integrating
cybernetic big five theory with the free energy principle a new strategy for modeling personalities
as complex systems by adam safran and colin de young the discussion will be facilitated by daniel
friedman who is going to start us off with a question you said that the characteristic
adaptations and life outcomes are exhaustive and so um that really is like we can partition them
into the adaptations are the things that the agent carries with them the synapses that have changed or
the scars they bear but basically what is not their surrounding and the life outcome is the niche
so then there's this stigma g where the agent is doing niche construction so this is from a different
non-active inference non-niche construction framework but finding resonances and finding uh concordances
here because that's kind of what we talk about is like the learning of agents and then the way that
influences their niche and then you had this idea of acting as if like the example with the person
who's um being forced by their niche to implement uh i'm a kind of person who says hello in this way or
things like that and then that also relates to what steven was saying earlier about drama
and about performance so maybe steven do you have a thought on that i am steven i'm in toronto and uh
the the the thing i like about what was mentioned here is how personality traits can be adapted
to context like someone's a salesperson if that was a useful example and then how that obviously starts
to then change your whole broader way of seeing things and one area i think might be interesting
and i've been there's the work of harry hest who's revisiting this the work of roger barker from the
60s we did a lot of work on behavior settings so he looked at a whole load of children across the u.s
and he looked at how their behavior was when they're in a school or in a cafe or different places
he found the difference in behavior between settings for the same child was bigger than the
difference in behavior between personalities of children i the same child was changing its behavior
radically based on the settings um and that that work kind of got lost but harry heft is sort of
been really pushing that again i think that can tie into this is maybe there's personality traits
i suppose you know how much stability there is but could behavior settings be kind of like
that kind of more dynamic version of personality traits and i think active influence it makes that
more possible to even have that conversation rather than the more sort of static psychometric
data which is kind of top down and kind of you just have to accept it feels like this is more you can
get in there and play with it a bit more in different directions thanks for sharing that stephen we'll go
colin and then anyone else who raises their hand
colin de young and i'm in minneapolis minnesota i'm a professor in the psychology department here at
the university of minnesota yeah so that's a really a really good point stephen which is that uh there is
there are differences that people have to specific situations that are distinct from their broad
patterns of consistency and personality and that's a long-running debate in personality psychology going
back to the to the late 60s um and the resolution to it basically is that yes there are these relatively
stable ways in which people respond to specific situations and that's what i'm trying to capture with
the idea of characteristic adaptations but then if you go across a bunch of character a bunch of
situations and you take the person's average there are also persistent averages that differ from person
to person and that would correspond to the trait so you can have both of these things in the same set
of data and will fleece and is a personality psychologist who has really been instrumental in
collecting the data to show this very basic feature of what are we measuring when we measure a
personality trait with something like a questionnaire where we're just asking somebody for this sort of
general impression of themselves and so what he's done is used experience sampling methods where you're
like you have somebody's smartphone and it you know pings them like five times a day and asks them like
how have you been acting for the last you know half an hour for the last hour and then you get them to rate
their behavior on a set of uh you know on a set of descriptions or categories what you see is that uh as you
said people have as much or even more variability within their own behavior as there is variability in terms of their
average behavior from person to person and yet nonetheless those averages are quite stable so if
you do this for one week you can get a whole you'll get a he calls them density distributions right you
basically just get uh you know and they're usually fairly normally shaped um and you do that for one week
you get this whole pattern so sometimes the person's acting very introverted sometimes they're acting
very extroverted you know it ranges um but there's there's a peak and that peak is very stable if you do it
again in another week so the person goes through another week of behavior and again they're
varying very widely in their behavior but if you look at their average level of that particular
behavior it's quite stable uh over time and so and then he's also shown that that correlates quite
highly with the ratings that we get from these general personality questionnaires so the questionnaires
really are tapping into this sort of general average tendency of specific behavior even though of
course the behavior itself varies widely from situation to situation and over time both due
to situational affordances and due to whatever is going on internally in terms of the goals that
the person is pursuing at that moment awesome let's go marco then adam hi i'm marco um i'm from
holland and used to work on active entrance in london but now i'm just um enjoying the progress
from the sidelines so someone mentioned steven mentioned the uh the kids in the classrooms in
the context and i think development might be also very interesting here because um personality might
be relatively stable across a lifetime but but i think hopefully we can agree that personality also
enriches um and in in that process of enrichment and i would also say empowerment um there's i think
you could say a shift between the balance of endogenous and exogenous influence on an agent's behavioral
adaptation or uh to its uh to its niches um and so there's a there's a change in the scope in which
the personality uh has a relatively large influence on the way they adapt and i guess i'm just asking
about thoughts on how you might picture that kind of process of how personality might actually in the
beginning um largely concern itself with how to engage with the world such that it might
internalize that which is normally co-op from the environment so normally you offload a lot of
stuff to behaviorally adapt which might explain the the variation due to environment but then over
time as it does so it internalizes certain heuristics certain patterns and policies and learn from
environments to kind of enrich its personality and then extend the scope uh of influence from their
personality um yeah i don't know if that makes sense but yeah cool thought adam and then anyone else
hi i'm adam i am based out of bloomington indiana uh i'm a postdoctoral researcher
uh so a few thoughts from before and then um some thoughts on marco's thoughts um so the fleece and
description of uh personality as a kind of uh density uh distribution um i think and the issue
of um the stability of personality and the variance of it um with within individuals across context which
is part of the reason the uh book that was this chapter was part of was called uh modeling persons
and situations but uh taking these ideas together uh we're kind of in the same territory uh that of
these fundamental questions in the free energy principle of like what is the ontological status
of a non-equilibrium steady state distribution bounded by a markov blanket um what's the granularity
over which we can find this this thing that we're identifying so it's your uh and so um
column will speak more to this but this idea of like there are ways of describing that
your degree of variability across context is itself something that can be stable and this could be
itself part of your personality um to uh now kind of loop back uh to what you were just describing marco um
i really like that idea um so it's like you're you're starting out
in a situation where through this interaction between you and this context um that you're
entering into in certain ways based on your own expectations and the expectations of
people in the environment and the structures that are there built up from this there's a certain
stability and then you both you uh
this stability um ends up shaping you um both just as a consequence of like this is the thing for you
to predict but also in the active inferential sense and as you're saying empowerment this is
what's going to help me get better purchase i'm reducing my uncertainty with respect to realizing the value
of uh existing and so this um idea that your personality being kind of um internalization of
structure and maybe at a certain stage almost like a kind of amortized inference um in terms of
uh which i got from you uh uh yeah i really like that idea a lot cool adam shannon hey i'm shannon crooks
i'm in south dakota so also in the snow but i'm based at the university of california in merced
um going on this developmental thread the idea that like when you're in a neonate in a body you're
literally relying on someone else's interoceptive states and biological states to regulate everything
about your interoceptive and biological states and then you're born and you're still kind of relying
on um that caregiver's interoceptive states or their behavior when they're holding you or coming
to comfort you um this i think could relate to what marco was saying about how your personality
develops so first if you have if a personality is something like a collection of effective states and
behaviors and an infant is completely sort of reliant on the environment and the social environment
to regulate its own personalities and as you grow through toddlerhood you slowly are able to
control this yourself like you can maintain your own body budget a little bit more um learn how to
how to get your own blanket if you're cold or like self-soothe and then you grow older and maybe you're
taught how to make music and learning that this is a new way that you can explore your personality or
create it but i feel like this can kind of connect if instead of looking or not instead of but in
addition to looking at averages but looking at like a time series of personality development over time
and like you could do at any point in time or at any range of time some sort of um like what would
be that the active reference model of your life in infancy and toddlerhood in you know rowdy teenage
years and as adult and you'll have you'll find these like steady trajectories at the same time
that was a bit rambling i hope someone can pick that up let me connect that to a few other points so
adam raised this question of what is the level of the thing or how do we identify things from
empirical data specifically so that we can use it in active inference type or free energy principle
type models do we use renormalization group or principle component analysis or some type of
adjacency matrix some type of markov blanket what are those things that we're actually going to be
modeling and that reminds me a lot of a theory called ant actor network theory by bruno latore and then
also on the ant wavelength colin was mentioning how there's so much variation within individuals but
also stable differences between and that reminded me a lot of my graduate school work with ant colonies
where day to day the variation across all the ant colonies was extreme if it was raining they would
do one thing if it was very dry versus if it had rained the day before those were massive determiners
of colony behavior however across days and even across years there were stable markers of colony
behavior and there were characteristic ways in which they responded to the environment so it is possible
to have a type of measurement and understanding of the system which my advisor established through long
term observation where you can actually model this development through time as well as within a population
which doesn't erase individual differences it actually is the framework by which individual
differences arise and then shannon just so beautiful with music being introduced like a thread of
personality and then that can be used to explore these regularities because i like what it mentions here
relatively stable parameters of cybernetic mechanisms the sort of those kind of dynamics i think that links
also to this idea of how that might change during our life and thinking about our lifetime
and one thing that i'm very interested in is is when trauma comes into play ptsd and other types of
situations and you know it's um it can really shift the state of someone and polyvagal theory kind of talks
to that where you've kind of got this sort of social co-regulation that we have as humans but we also have
our kind of primal kind of fight or flight or our gut sort of sort of fear um responses and how those things
are in a way they another type of like pattern behavior which becomes incredibly stable too stable like
you can shut down or you might get into rage but then over the period of the day or life the challenge
is they may it may be unregulated about when they appear so someone might sort of be a certain way and
then they flash into rage you know and then they come come back into and their personality is radically
different and i think this is so then there might be interesting to bring in that that that as a as a
kind of a what happens when that relatively stable state itself flips you know um so that the and it
might say your your mechanism might not be cognitive but it might be in that kind of um polyvagal system
yes the body influencing phase transitions in personality or behavior adam and then colin thanks
um yes i think uh colin should probably speak to what was just brought up in terms of like what
actually happens with people um but in terms of uh like a high level of abstraction um so yeah it seems
like there's this sense in which you can think of personality as a kind of core screening but it's
uh in a kind of renormalization and um in terms of it existing as a phenomenon and it's a and
epistemically it's a kind of core screening um afforded by this renormalization um this kind of
throwing away a variability as you form these higher level attracting states um that you can uh
ignore them uh within the scope of a certain type of modeling that you're engaging in
with respect to having certain objectives of trying to predict certain things
whether you're a personality modeler trying to predict someone else or trying to predict yourself
or whatever um the so within this um looking for this like optimal level of epistemic grip in
terms like the granularity of your description um this
you could describe these cybernetic control parameters as being
uh part of the causal uh process of what's responsible and then if you take the system
and you perturb it there's going to be like a range where like the order parameter changes
you can get these non-linear maybe phase shifts where the um you're now in a different regime and
it may look like a very different kind of person because the personality structure as this
stable attractor network um can then become destabilized
um and so that would be like a high level and college probably speak to like what actually
happens with people cool yeah colin go for it so you get these phase shifts in behavior but they're
often due to persistent sensitivities in the underlying mechanisms right so let's take um well so uh ptsd
okay um what you have there essentially is some kind of traumatic event uh is an intervention that
resets the sensitivity of the threat systems and so the that corresponds quite well to the big five
dimension that's labeled as neuroticism which is an old-fashioned word but in this context basically
just means sensitivity to all different kinds of negative emotion um and so obviously that's heightened
in ptsd and what that means fundamentally is that you've gone through some kind of traumatic event
that led to your your it wasn't just learning about a specific event right what it did was that it
reset the sensitivity of your threat system as a whole so now you are perceiving threats and
reacting with defensive negative emotion to much more minor situations than you would have previously
and of course even in terms of risk for ptsd we know that people who are higher in threat
sensitivity to begin with are more likely to develop ptsd so it's not like it comes out of nowhere
typically but nonetheless there's obviously this change and there was a recent really nice meta-analysis of
personality change following uh therapy and different types of psychotherapy whether it's
pharmaceutical or talk therapy or cognitive behavioral therapy all of these lead to changes
in personality and the the trait that changes the most as you might expect is reductions in neuroticism
right so uh what we're talking about here is the ability to shift these underlying parameters
that are not constantly manifest in the same way so when we say that somebody is high in trait anxiety
for example we don't mean that they're experiencing anxiety at every minute of every day at a high
level right we just mean that they're more likely to be anxious more intensely in more situations than
somebody who is low in trait anxiety but nonetheless then if we really want to understand the dynamics of
the system we need to understand those phase shifts from like feelings of safety to feelings of
anxiety at any given moment and i think that's what you're talking about but in order to understand how
that works for a given agent we also need to understand these persistent patterns of the
sensitivities that lead them to have these shifts in different situations at different degrees than
other agents very cool thank you we hope you enjoyed this episode stay tuned for next time where we're
going to have more discussions of this paper
