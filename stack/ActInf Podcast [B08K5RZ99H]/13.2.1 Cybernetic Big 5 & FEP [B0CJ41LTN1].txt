the episode description i am blue knight the host and curator of this episode which is clipped from
live stream number 13.2 this discussion is based on the 2020 paper entitled integrating cybernetic
big five theory with the free energy principle a new strategy for modeling personalities as complex
systems by adam saffron and colin de young daniel friedman is going to start us off and facilitate
this discussion one theme to return to is that by looking at the patterns and thinking about the
frameworks that span different systems of different levels of analysis we can think about like the
traits of organizations teams individuals organs cells so that's the multi-scale kind of complex
systems approach because we set out to look for patterns across systems and then that led to all
these interesting questions like would there be a big five for teams or how are the generative models
of individual personality related to the generative models or the generative processes underlying group
uh personalities and so pretty interesting things that we're coming to colin go ahead and then anyone else
uh colin de young and i'm in minneapolis minnesota um i'm a professor in the psychology department
here at the university of minnesota i'll just make one point in relation to this issue of uh you know
team dynamics and personalities at other scales um that's something that there are different ways to
approach it right so people have certainly psychologists have certainly studied uh what happens to teams
that have different characteristics of the individual members uh and so you can think of how do the
personalities of individual members of a team influence the success of the team um so for
example people having people high in openness on the team tends to uh make it more effective in
various ways and it seems to be because of the that's especially true for leaderless teams right so if
you have a it's not necessarily true if there's a clearly established kind of leadership structure in
the team but if you have leaderless teams then you know having people who are more sort of
cognitively flexible enables them to kind of organize themselves better so but i think that what we're
thinking about here is something a little bit different like is there a personality of a team
as a whole that might be more than the sum of its parts um and you know they're you're probably they're
probably going to be well you need to do a sort of parallel kind of research in terms of trying to
come up with a a comprehensive disc set of descriptors of the properties of teams and then
seeing if they varied systematically in the same way that people did with individuals and uh leading to
the big five but i guess one of my intuitions is that the highest level of the personality hierarchy
stability and plasticity which are also uh the most uh replicable across different languages when people
have done the kind of big five research so there's this very clear way in which uh what i think of as
the two fundamental properties of all cybernetic systems you know at least ones that have to be able
to function in an unpredictable and complex environment that is probably applicable at virtually uh any scale
even for something that might not be well it's a i think it's an interesting question whether something
like a team or a society is actually a cybernetic system itself or whether it is an emergent dynamic out
of a set of uh cybernetic systems interacting with each other but regardless i think you can
certainly describe the stability and plasticity of teams or even societies right you can describe
them in terms of how much they focus on and value uh the lack of disruption of their functioning versus
how much they value uh expansion and exploration and sort of dynamic growth cool that reminds me so much
of the ant research and do colonies have phenotypes or is it just the phenotypes of nestmates the
selection shape colony traits or is it just shaping the nestmates and they're duking it out so all these
multi-level systems we kind of can see these similarities so adam and then scott and then anyone else
hi i'm adam i am based out of bloomington indiana uh i'm a postdoctoral researcher
so in relation to what colin just said um correct me if i'm wrong but i believe in terms of like
cross-cultural like the robustness um like is it the stability and plasticity like this like that level
of granularity actually is what is the most broadly applicable in terms of like showing the least variation
like if you look at it in those two yes so in terms of the lexical research like starting from a specific
language and extracting descriptors and then doing the same kind of you know ratings and factor analytic
work the only truly universal solution that's been found is the two-factor solution and those factors
very closely resemble stability and plasticity okay so yeah so that would support the idea that like if
we're trying to do like a multi-scale personality story or a a quasi anthropomorphizing of of uh of
quasi agents or maybe we should just call them agents uh depending on our view that yes we will be most
likely to find stability and plasticity but um you know because like you basically grounded the big five
as part of cybernetic functioning and if any uh system like from an active inference perspective if
any like sustaining uh system is doing some kind of either explicit or implicit goal pursuit we actually
might find like even the big five itself like being surprisingly applicable although like as you're
saying like it's an empirical question and so like so i guess the idea is we actually do the research
program of this sort of derivation of factors and then with and then we should expect to find things
that might be uh shockingly like the big five in places where you might not expect them the best
analogy for that that's going on in science right now is uh over the last let's say 20 years people
have really started to take seriously the idea of personality and other species now i mean whether
personality is the right word there or you want some other one it doesn't really matter right you have
individual differences in psychological functioning of other species and so people have been doing
this attempting to come up with you know extensive sets of descriptors of other species and uh you
know ratings of them or coding based on you know video or observation or whatever and then looking to
see whether there are these similar patterns and most of the big five are identifiable uh or you know
fairly close analogs in other species and um the one that is the least commonly found is actually maybe
sort of uh you know proof of concept in a way because conscientiousness is the dimension that least
appears in other species something like conscientiousness and and in fact the only two
species where something close to that has appeared as its own separate dimension is in bonobos and
chimpanzees right and so you think like what really makes humans special well it's our ability to plan for
the distant future and to prioritize goals that aren't uh meet immediate or near immediate and to really
have these elaborate goal hierarchies and so it might not be surprising that it's only our
nearest evolutionary neighbors that have uh these kind of identifiable patterns that are uh that are
related to those abilities and that are separate from things just like you know how emotionally reactive you are
very interesting scott and then i think adam and then marco
thank you hello everyone my name is scott david i'm at the university of washington applied physics lab
where i'm the director of the information risk research initiative so that this is great this um
one of the things i thought was interesting is like you know what gets measured gets done
and what gets measured gets seen and so it's kind of interesting because we're coming it's like a bio
theory of everything kind of idea here and we're like wow this is really explanatory my recollection
is that quantum mechanics was just a calculation convention originally but it kind of works and we
kind of use it and even though we don't understand all of it it's kind of helpful that way so it's not
so much is it true but is it useful and it's this is broadly useful and so it's interesting in living
systems or cybernetic systems we start to get at these questions we ask what are we're it's like
we're using the turing test in a way it's too much hubris about our form of intelligence right and so
if we point our measurement instrument at a certain thing that's we're going to see if we point our
measurement instrument at human cognition human consciousness our sense of human consciousness
that's what we're going to see and so this is a great discussion there's no it's not a to me it's not
a truth finding thing but a a usefulness of the paradigm kind of issue one metaphor on the big
five and uh it's kind of like the big five continents that's what we have in the world as we have it and
so that is specifics that's related to history and that changes but the the principle is water and land
and so maybe in a different system a different sphere with a different type of water level you still
would have water and land but the actual number of big dimensions might be empirically seen to be
different so that's kind of an interesting thing um i think adam then marco then colin it's
interesting about um so conscientiously being less likely to generalize potentially across species or
systems because uh it seems like that makes some sense to me and that um in terms of you know
preserving uh goal hierarchy integrity as you're confronted with all these different like circumstances
but you want to maintain this overall like broadly applicable goal hierarchy that's um benefiting you
overall um in order for that to be the case you have to have a system capable of generative modeling with or
modeling with a certain degree of temporal depth and the policies is pursuing and counterfactual richness
such that it could actually get itself into trouble and get confused and go down like wrong paths and so
you wouldn't expect this for all systems you would expect this you need a certain degree of sophistication
even maybe sophisticated effective inference in order for you to really actually need something like
conscientiousness so that one actually might not generalize as much um the and relate to uh what
scott just said um there seems to be this yeah interesting combination it's like um realist versus
instrumentalist or it's like you can think of like this personality is almost like uh like the big five is
like an effective field theory over persons um where it's um a good approximate description um a useful
core screening but now the question i would have those but is it like just completely so there's a
sense in which it's it's modeler relative it's based in our interests but there's like another sense
in which it's like well um like what worked in evolution and like and it's like you don't have to
take the perspective of evolution but it's a we can all kind of converge on it it's like quasi objective
like it's one of many perspectives but it's a pretty you know darn good perspective or an important one to
keep in mind and so in that sense the big five actually might be carving nature at its joints in a really
powerful way and so i guess one more thing along those lines is um uh i think we good for
probably colin to talk about this since you discovered them uh which is the aspects um and so one thing i'm wondering is
uh so it's it seems like in a lot of studies when you do things at the level that so as a
correct me if i'm wrong but it's kind of um so under so the big five has this hierarchical structure
over them you'll have these two meta traits which we've been discussing of stability as shared variants
of um uh conscientiousness agreeableness and inverse neuroticism and plasticity as shared
variants of extroversion and openness but then underneath the big five um confidently that you'll
get if you like force if you'd like to have the water level uh go there's a downer up i'm i'm messing
up daniel's like analogy but you'll get um two and only two aspects underneath each of them and what's
interesting is they oftentimes kind of read as being at cross purposes with each other it's like
these are very different they're very different it's very different to be like industrious versus
orderly like these are very different ways of being in the world or if like you're neurotic
it's like very different to being like um withdrawing or being like more volatile and like reactive
like um and so i guess one thing i'm wondering is like both in doing um active inferential modeling of
persons and trying to suss out personality would it be better to actually in some ways focus on the
aspects in terms of finding joints there but also maybe across other cybernetic systems like
could there be more purpose uh purchase from the aspects um so in terms of this idea of uh of
continents and water and land i do think that there's a way in which uh you know stability and
plasticity are like the equivalent of of water and land so that pretty much any organism you're
going to be able to identify you know if there's any kind of individual variability which of course
there must be in order for evolution to proceed like so probably um you know if you take amoebas
for example they're not going to have a lot of different personality dimensions but nonetheless you
might find some that are a bit more uh of the same species that are a bit more exploratory and others
that are a bit more uh more cautious let's say so you know even at this very simple level you may get
this trade-off between uh do you do things that keep your functioning running uh without disruption or
do you do things that lead to greater uh expanse and uh discovery of new resources so those probably do
trade-off i would hope that when we're within a species though that the the big five are not
um like just the continents in other words they're not just a historical accident i think
that they actually reflect variation in parameters that have evolved and that are present in uh in
every you know intact organism of that species the issue though in terms of carving nature at its joints
it's just that the nature in this case is so complicated right so uh if you look at this is a
good figure actually that uh didn't put up to make this point which is that um when we draw these kinds
of hierarchical taxonomies of personality traits uh they are necessarily over simplifications especially
at the levels below the big five because we know that personality does not have simple structure
and what that means from a factor analytic perspective is that if you took the taxonomy
exactly literally that's depicted there you would say well for example uh no trait that is underneath
extroversion that's a subcomponent of extroversion can be related to any trait that is a subcomponent
of agreeableness right because there are no lines connecting them in that figure but in fact the pattern of
association and co-variation among more specific personality traits below the big five is considerably
more complicated than that would suggest and so for example assertiveness is negatively correlated with
politeness right so assertiveness is part of extroversion politeness is part of agreeableness
those are correlated with each other however it happens that the enthusiastic sort of sociable
component of extroversion is positively correlated with the other aspect of agreeableness which is compassion
and caring about other people and so you have two different components of extroversion correlating in
opposite directions with two different components of agreeableness and those end up canceling each
other out and so at the first at the other level you see no correlation between agreeableness and extroversion
uh essentially okay so this whole thing you know the structure it looks simple in the picture but uh you
know it's a lot more complicated uh the the lower down you go and so i would have you know i it seems to
me that this aspect level distinctions are important uh they have their they are supported by some
behavioral genetic research as well as some of my own research just at the phenotypic level um i think
that they're probably the most important distinction within each of the big five in terms of discriminant
validity in other words uh you often get things that are predicted differently at that level um so for
example uh politeness and compassion are the two aspects of agreeableness and well it turns out that
uh if you look at people's political orientation people who identify as more left-wing or liberal uh
score higher in compassion people who identify as higher in uh conservatism more right-wing
score higher in politeness right so conservatives are more polite liberals are more compassionate
well what happens when you go up to agreeableness you see no correlation with political attitudes which
people found surprising for a long time because it's you know issues around altruism and cooperation
seem very relevant to political issues and policy well so it turns out that that's because something
lower than the big five actually is associated with uh with political attitudes in opposite directions
so i definitely think that these lower levels of the hierarchy can be useful um you know there's less
the the evidence for the big five is remarkably extensive right whereas the evidence for that next
level down that i've worked on is much less extensive nonetheless you know again i think
there isn't just one way to carve this system up because the patterns of interrelatedness are so
complicated and i do think that these are useful uh useful sub-dimensions at any rate even if you could
focus on others so i'll i'll leave that there cool thanks we hope you enjoyed this week's episode
stay tuned for next time where we will have more discussions from this same live stream
