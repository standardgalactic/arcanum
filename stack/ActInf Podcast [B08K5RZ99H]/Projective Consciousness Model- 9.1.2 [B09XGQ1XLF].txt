welcome to the active podcast we will present short digestible segments clipped from the active
inference lab weekly live streams if you like what you hear and you want to learn more check
out the entire live stream at the active inference lab youtube channel the link to the live stream is
provided in the episode description my name is blue knight and i will be guiding you through this
podcast episode which is clipped from active lab live stream number 9.1 this discussion will be
loosely structured around the paper the projective consciousness model and phenomenal selfhood by
kenneth wilford daniel bennekin carl friston and david rodroff steven sellette is going to start
us off thinking about perspectival consciousness and daniel friedman will jump in to facilitate
the rest of the discussion well one thing i thought was interesting was this idea of perspectival
consciousness so this idea that when you're consciously taking a perspective on your situation
um which you normally might think of as seeing it but it could be some sort of embodied sense so i think
that was kind of important and there and how that differs from maybe the unconscious um dynamics that
are just going on that they don't necessarily deal with so it's somehow sitting i don't know if it's
sitting on top or sitting alongside it but there's there's somehow this perspectival piece that somehow
kicks in yeah and we often think about vision in talking about how active inference is to be
differentiated from let's just say a sensory relay model where you know photons come in your brain
categorizes them and makes an image and then you act and here it's like it's a generative model of
the world that you're experiencing that's why there's color and good resolution around the edges
and no blind spot and then it's like well then why do we see what appears to be coming from our eyes or
from a position that's right there and that's where we're going to come back to with a lot of these
questions about the projection itself and why we appear to be situated lee i'm lee i'm in london
uh um i'm just thinking about so the the discovery of perspective uh you know back in the in the
enlightenment and i was thinking well obviously you know if this is a sort of a more generic
theory of consciousness then um i was wondering if it connected perhaps to metzinger's idea of
transparent states so that uh you know the projective geometry would have always been there but
they would have been transparent and somehow you know in the process of the discovery of perspective
uh it became something that we were able to pay attention to more more consciously anyway just
a thought cool idea let me actually unpack that first what would you describe as the transparent
state because i don't know of that terminology specifically what is a transparent state here
so i think in metzinger's model so transparent states will be those states that we are that we
view the world through so we then we're in a stable we don't know that we're having a particular state
whereas he he contrasted to us a metro so an opaque state would be a state where we where we understand
that it's a um a sensory state if you know what i mean cool the transparent state it's kind of like
what is water the water we swim in it's like the water is transparent so when you look out yeah all
directions it's not being seen specifically yeah okay it's like you're looking through it you're looking
through it but you're not able to actually observe it as a state of of your as a state and embodied
state that you're having if you see what i mean yeah just to unpack this one bit for steven um it's
kind of like without a theory of air you could just look forever and you could just have any model could
replace this idea about what fills up space then there's this chemical theory of air and there have
been various chemical theories of air and whether there's four types of things and they mix or whether
it's protons and neutrons and different ratios and things like that and then once you have a theory
of air you could ask things like well what if i compressed all of the quote invisible stuff in this
room and all of a sudden it looks like blue or something it's like whoa it kind of is there there's
unique experiments there's unique predictions i'm taking something that was transparent in the niche
that actually was real ontologically real and then through attention and awareness and affordances
we're able to now like look at it so we've developed projective geometry and it's like whoa what if it
really were projective geometry all along but then now with the projective geometric tools we're coming
back to experience that and it's actually something that steven and i were talking about just this
weekend with um a little bit like what people's experiences of perspective have been in the past um
because there is those sometimes funny pictures um at least comical sometimes where it's like
a person's face and it looks like it's from a almost a cubist angle but it's like a renaissance
painting and there's probably so much to say from an art history perspective about the evolution and
the development of perspective but at the very least it seems like people throughout time have
been differentially excited by different types of representations of perspective people weren't doing
photo realistic charcoal drawings in a different era even if they could have had the um
technologies to do so so something's happening there with perspective and how it's changing the way that
we interact with the visual world cubism of course was shocking and uh when it came out and so now where
are we with perspective um there's a lot to say about that steven yeah i mean one of the things that's
interesting with like imagined feelings in space is that they can be kind of transparent so if you like
what's the energy of someone or if i imagine the energies of people around me it's like a quality
those qualities they don't like if you imagine something in space it doesn't become completely
opaque it's not like you can't see that you're in the room anymore you know so even if you're on stage
as an actor and you imagine that you're in a scene with a king and it's an empty stage and you start
to imagine the whole stage you it's still slightly transparent in relation to the physical
perceptive conscious physical space if that makes sense so those two things are kind of
interplaying yep yeah and and to bring that to the affordances in the field of affordances field
of consciousness it's like the generative model isn't just of what the video camera would see if it
were next to your head the generative model is actually generating this field of action that's
scaled geometrically so that things that are closer to you and better within reach are seemingly at
hand and things that are distant are seemingly distant and one example that steven and i were
talking about was like there might be an object on the other side of my monitor that i'd have to
kind of go around to reach and just right with a quick judgment it feels like something on the other
side of my monitor is actually further away than something that might be linearly closer um or further
away sorry but like i can reach it directly just by reaching my hand over i can reach two feet over
with my arm just grab it but the 18 inches linearly to the monitor i have to end up doing a 36 inch
route so it feels longer away so even within our at hand concepts and the way that we talk about what
is accessible or what is relevant these all have to do with the grasping and the comprehending and the
action distortion of a space so there's really a lot here about the perspectives that we take
and if we say there's one perspective and it's mine there's one perspective and it's my cultures or is it
hey we're all at this party and we're all going to have different perspectives of this party
okay which perspectives can hang which ones can't those are the kinds of discussions that you get to
there instead of is it right wrong the way i'm seeing it because you know not everyone's going to
see the party like you see it because no one's head is overlapping with your perception because
everyone's affordances and location are different for example sasha hi my name is sasha yeah i really
appreciated in this paper um the kind of connection um uh we're always talking about on this stream um
between uh you know taking in information and acting um and so it's this feedback loop of two things
and i really like this converting uh thinking about our space into thinking about the space of affordances
so that it's not just a you know a blank slate of information that uh you could access or not
but it's really what you are able to do with that information and how you're going to act on it
so i yeah i just thought that was a really nice connection and fits in very well with what we're
talking about and kind of builds up this um similar theme of how you're going to connect action and
perception cool and just one other example that that kind of uh made me think about it's like when
i'm dissecting an insect under a microscope um it's very small movements of the fingers but it in the
field of vision of a microscope will swing the forceps like you know 30 degrees so it'll be a a radical
motion under the microscope but it has the exact same embodiment feel as like swinging one's arm almost
as if what matters is how much i'm seeing my body move within a visual field and how radical of an
affordance it is like flailing my arm versus a more fine-tuned movement but a fine-tuned movement with
the arm is like one inch but that's represented by a certain number of degrees and that ends up being
like visually almost the same number of degrees that i can move the forceps so even though it's at a
different spatial scale because the attention and the affordances are down at that scale and i have the
visual um ability the umwelt to perceive at that smaller scale which couldn't be seen if it were
the naked eye it takes on a feeling like it's in the regular vision regular body world and then also
the uh forceps don't have nerves but they're sensitized so there's a lot to say and think about
there um a few questions that i just wrote down here just like these are of course perennial questions
there's they're not going to be answered in a couple minutes but what's exciting about studying
consciousness what do we agree on what do people agree on what do people disagree on and then also
what do people agree is unknown what are the known unknowns where might there be unknown unknowns and
then also to always return to what is active inference doing here what could it do here what could some
other theory do here what do you think shannon hey i'm shannon so your story about the forceps in
the microscope reminded me of the first example of like extended consciousness that i learned about
in a philosophy of mind class in undergrad and our professor was talking about divers um who are they're
not actually diving they're in a room and they're controlling a camera like on a little submarine that's
underwater and they start to feel like they are the submarine so much so that their body's actually
responding to the the pressure differences that they would experience if they were diving so if the
submarine comes up very fast they'll actually feel like they're experiencing the bends that would happen
if they were a diver coming up so fast i don't know if this is a true um story i've never looked it up but
it's very intriguing that your consciousness can be can be so extended that you end up having these
embodied effects that you perhaps could empirically measure if you if you were if you had some sensors
on on these people as they were experiencing these extended conscious moments cool lee um i was just going
to ask shannon um do you know whether that depends on whether the people controlling the remote
sub were have previously died as well so they kind of got the you know the embodied experience as part
of their model i think for that for specifically the bends it would or maybe they would have to know
about the bends because that's a very specific thing that doesn't happen to your body in any other case
yeah one thing that makes me think of is like uh the drop in a techno song when everything's building
and the tension's building but that's actually a cultural regime of affordance and different sub
genres of electronica or different people who are aren't familiar with electronica they might get
chills going down their spine it's like oh this is the sickest drop ever but somebody else might just
not be tuned into that regime of attention and therefore it's like okay wait what happened
why is it just why did the drums stop something like that so similarly it's like the diver
if they're part of this deep generative model and then they're they're emulating it or they're
simulating it somehow um this diving then they may have a deeply learned reflex about changing their
blood pressure let's just you know go with stock experiment being vaguely you know feeling true
just ish that you could if you're doing a first person shooter immersive video game your heart is
going to start pounding not because you need increased blood flow that's a psychological response
so trained psychological responses in increasingly immersive environments like ar and vr
will generate physiological responses and that is actually part of the thrill that was i mean there's
so much happening here and it doesn't really go into the ar vr here but like what if we unprojected
our projective geometry what would happen or what about these uh sort of alice in wonderland type
simulators for the ar and the vr where you reach you reach towards something but your arm moves twice
as fast or you reach towards something and your arm doesn't move you crash into stuff and it just
feels like you're like super disoriented or the glasses are flipped all of these transformations
are just super deep interventions into the structure of sense and action so there's a lot
that is now possible here with how we can on the fly remap these things in 1920 the cubists could
put a light on one side of the cube and draw it and then halfway through the drawing move the light
and get a different perspective and that was kind of cool like a mashup of perspectives
in one two-dimensional plane but now you could be experiencing like a lot more stuff happening and
the cube could be mutating it could be a hypercube and stuff like that it's kind of next level with
respect to our geometry and how it relates to our sense and action we hope you enjoyed this week's
episode stay tuned for next time we will have more discussions of the same paper outlining the
functional features of consciousness described by the authors
