this is the active podcast where we provide short clips from the active inference institute weekly
live streams if you're interested in hearing more of this material check out the entire live stream
at the active inference institute youtube channel the link to the live stream is provided in the
episode description my name is blue knight and this week we're going to continue discussing a
variational approach to scripts clipped from live stream number 10.2 daniel friedman is facilitating
our discussion starting off talking about scripts relationships and active inference keep listening
to find out where we end up i want to raise some new questions about scripts relationships and active
inference the first question is how might scripts of different kinds whether the strong weak internal
external or some other feature that people are wondering about how might they conceptualize of
social relationships so what might anybody think about um how would scripts conceptualize of social
relationships and then i'll just throw up the second question too which is how could active inference
add depths and tools or context to the social scripts concept
any thoughts from any domain are good steven i might be curious like to hear about from a practice
side how how do we bring these ideas and then make them like tangible and experienced
thank you hi i'm steven i'm based in toronto i think this is this is actually where this scale
question becomes kind of kind of becomes a challenge right because as we're trying to net map things
out um with social networks so there's a lot of social network or participatory inference mapping is
one process which is quite useful for looking at and trying to understand how we um relate to each
other's stories and experiences in our network but the question becomes is um how do we relate this
um this kind of perspective we try to take on stuff with the scripts we use and then come back to well
how much of those scripts are just manifestations of embodied inactive ecological behavior and we've kind
of reified them so i i suppose um it becomes this we we it's very much i think there's a kind of a um
um a situated um way that we we we kind of reenact or recapitulate this whole thing depending on the discussion
so you know like if you're all sitting around a table like in that board meeting where people are putting
together pictures of a puzzle they might be working with the scripts of how they should um assemble their perspectives and then you've got someone in a um who's performing in a ritual and it might be
a ritual and it might be much more about how they need to hold themselves as a person so i think
there's something quite interesting that this whole scripts thing raises in terms of of the scale question
and i suppose that's partly why you know maxwell sort of ends up working a lot in here as well because i think
it ties back to the question of well what scale is the script happening at and that has a big impact when you try to then
talk to people in a practice context because if you're working with a community or an organization or
strategic strategy levels doing strategic foresight they they may be having their own kind of um scripts
that shape their social practices in that kind of domain so i think this is this is kind of interesting
what you just said there reminds me of uh two people like looking at a river and they're seeing
different things they're seeing different scripts for the river there's no disagreement about what
the river is doing one person looks at it and says yep at the fork it goes left and the other person says
it goes with the flow and today it's going left and so in that sense um they're seeing different scripts
but they're not disagreeing about what actually is happening and so it's like there's multiple concepts that are
being projected onto the observables and then there's the story about those two people and how
they reconcile their perspectives by the riverbank and so yes the scripts concept does seem to apply
everywhere um but maybe to uh begin to chisel away at what isn't a script i would say a chair could be a
prop but i don't think a chair has a model where it is actually in agents doesn't have agency it's not an
active entity in the script though it can be mobilized by actors in a way that a prop can be
it can become enlivened but it isn't with a generative model of that situation rj my name
is rj corday uh i'm in new york and i'm currently researching organizational dynamics intelligence
analysis and narrative warfare yeah the chair the chair is an object that can be a part of a script
but but it i don't think it can it's not a script itself and it can't act out any scripts right
because it's not it's not an actor um uh uh unless maybe you know going out there it's like maybe if
it were a mechanical chair of some kind like a massage chair then it has a script that has been
encoded by by some other actor um but yeah i don't know sasha hi my name is sasha i'm also in california
and that was a plot twist with the massage chair uh but perhaps uh the ability to um
participate in a script does that does that imply that um you're able to respond differently in
different situations because uh a chair will always be chairing um but an individual or our
participate yeah participator in a script um they can change uh based on the context
and the kind of script that they're participating in so maybe that's a key aspect of uh being a
participator in a script steven yeah i think this chair is quite an interesting example and i suppose
like in theater they often work with masks and the mask i think they might be sort of bringing this back
to the bodies like there's there's something about the mask and identity and taking off a mask and
i haven't really thought about this before but i don't know say a throne compared to another chair
could the throne almost be coated with a mask you know i mean it starts to have an identity
and it's like you know so i mean a red nose is basically the smallest mask you can wear it's
basically become a clown but all this work and we don't tend to do much with masks if you go back to
sort of indigenous cultures everyone was working with masks you know um so something interesting in
is there something about the script which is about how we broadcast and receive through this part of
the body thanks rj bouncing off what steven's saying um so one one of the things when i first read the
paper i talked to you about this standard like immediately after reading the paper i think
was um that uh if you look at uh there's common rituals between north american indians nordic cultures
african like all over the place where where um what happens is there's there's it's either dances
something along those lines where you use animal masks and act out the scripts that those animals use it's
really important especially for you know like uh so i i brought up to you dan at one point the bear
uh in particular because a bear's animal that has a set of of scripts that you can identify
that it's using um and and if you don't have experience um you know knowing like reading their
behavior then you're more than likely going to get hurt or put yourself in a really dangerous situation
situation so like um park services in north america routinely make the point that almost all
negative bear encounters happen because people don't know how to interact with the bear they run
um they they're they're not doing the right behavior so even with like like a black bear they
play dead and so don't play don't play dead with a black bear because they're going to investigate
they want to figure out like okay easy you know easy meal they're they're they're they're curious
and they're going to go mess with you um so what what these rituals did was they gave young people
who hadn't had the experience yet an opportunity to see those scripts in action then before they may
have ever interacted with the animal they may be asked to play out that script take the place of the
bear wear the mask and and it gives you so acting out the script of the other person gives you a better
sense of or in this case the animal gives you a better sense of what it's like to be that animal
so um in that case like acting out those scripts that other people may be using or you know other
other active other actors would be using um you know actually is an advantage in the environment um
on you brought up the throne though and it's like yeah it's it's uh um well i i like i like the
presentation of it as a mask for a chair um but uh uh it's it's really important in denoting the
person who sits in this chair should be acting a certain way right and and when they don't it's a
joke right so i don't know i i was just thinking about like like a few things there there's uh
it's almost like there's a um a real advantage to understanding and then acting out the scripts of
others nice rj the hero with a thousand chairs as it were um i also didn't bring up wolves and i
wasn't praised for that so exactly oh wait blue so just kind of thinking about like the chair itself
is actually like supposed to act a certain way like you're supposed to do certain things with
the chair right and and i mean i i'm always telling my kids like that's for sitting you've
got the wrong end of you on the chair like so people get creative right like with the different
roles that a chair can play it can be like a step stool or it can be you know some piece of
gymnastic equipment and it's just it's just interesting to think about changing this script even for
a chair let alone the person that's sitting in a chair yeah it's like the setup for an improv scene
and yeah the different kinds of chairs are going to lend themselves to different scenes maybe with a
throne maybe they could enact a classical monarchy script or maybe it's a monty python it's a satire
or with certain kinds of chairs or in certain contexts you can enact a chivalry script and you can pull
the chair out for your colleague so there's all kinds of ways that um different props facilitate or
enable different scripts to play out and you can always do a mime like you can sort of act out a
uh digging or you can act out playing baseball but you do need the props our extended cognition to
actually do some of these scripts that involve our extended niche sasha um i just wanted to touch on
something stephen said uh that um you said today we don't do much with masks um
um i i guess i would disagree because it seems like uh a lot of us are doing a lot with masks
and um it's just yeah kind of obvious to think that um that's a prop that is going to change our
behavior in ways we might not even recognize and um yeah just important to think about um
how this uh new prop is changing human interaction and script and um behavior in ways that we don't
want or really expect uh a mask to change blue
so sasha didn't come right out and say it but i'm gonna like maybe point it at what you're saying maybe
not maybe i should get out of context but um i think that we do do a lot with masks like we are
right now using the biggest mask ever like people are totally different in like their online persona
like some people will hide behind a computer screen and act in ways that they would never ever behave
in real life right so they have this like mask up they can create this new persona and and go forward in
the world with that yep very true and with new props there's new scripts there's the one person's
wearing a mask but the other one isn't script there's the is that person wearing an n95 script
there's all these things that wouldn't have even made sense in 2019 so that's the sense making and
the cultural sense making and the tension and the friction when there's differences on opinion or
differences in behavior and it's about um not just estimates of state but actually uncertainty and
estimates about other people's uncertainty that this whole like recursive and embedded element of
active inference and it's about navigating the uncertainty of a situation not just maximizing
the state itself and that's something we'll return to for sure steven yeah i think this is
interesting when you start to put the mask so there's i suppose i was talking about you know playing
with the mask physically within the proximity of your face but yeah there's there's this kind of
mask out there but it in some ways it's become abstracted and um like it's it's almost not like
you can you put it on and put it off it's it's it's sort of almost part of the ecosystem that we've kind
of created which is maybe a little bit unhealthy because we don't um there's actually one really
interesting activity i did once there's a chap from rwanda who does healing work and he would get you to
put a mask on in front of your face and read a poem that was really personal and then you had to lower
the mask but it was like you were lowering the whole of your sort of masking identity and it left
you feeling this incredible rawness which is really interesting so i suppose um yeah there is this
tendency now that and i think even maybe more since the 1980s if i look back at videos of people in the 80s
on tv and that they're often a lot more nervous in front of the camera now people are used to putting
up a some sort of smiley face type of thing and presenting i think there's um there's there's something
quite interesting in that that might relate to this paper yeah i've been thinking about that too like with
the selfie new affordance of being able to add an arm's length look back not just with a disposable
camera and snap the pic and have the perspectival imagination of being at your arm's end but
actually seeing it in real time and then video chatting or live streaming where you can see your
own face during an interaction so it's like you're seeing the mask in real time and then that's sort of
like um i think it's a campbell quote or could be someone else but like if you think that you're rejecting
the mask that society gives you you're just wearing the mask of rejection everybody can see that it's
not exactly the quote but basically it's like you can't not play the mask game there has to be an
epithelium there has to be a facade there has to be an interface and so we're talking about designing
that interface because somebody who goes around saying no this is me this is me i have no mask this
is just what i am it's like right but there still is an external layer that's being presented right
and if someone says no i'm all me there's no external level it's like whoa big of true of
course but then it's not a helpful viewpoint for the world because we do need to interface
we need to send emotions reliably and receive emotions reliably and so um a lot there let's
continue with some of these fun questions what could be a fun or interesting social experiment
related to active inference whether it's something that we do like a little experiment or just daily
routine tweak or whether this is something that could be carried out with a larger scale
laboratory online or in a social setting rj i think i have um something i've been thinking
about that may relate to the prior one on network relationships um so uh uh my dog achilles uh he
usually wakes me up in the morning uh for for like the last year or so uh we go on a walk at like
5 a.m um and he is usually rearing ready to go on that walk so i never really had to worry about
an alarm clock he always you know he would always pawn me awake um and if i like there's no snooze
button on a dog it is you know he he's there until i wake up um but recently after thanksgiving um
so i have achilles and my parents have his brother socrates and socrates has been staying with us
so now socrates plays with him during the day wears him the hell out and uh ever since thanksgiving um
he doesn't wake up in the morning anymore he doesn't want to wake up he wants to sleep in
so he had a script that was present in the morning that he now no longer has and this has led to me
over sleeping almost every day because i'm not i don't have any script for for interacting with an alarm
clock in the morning anymore uh so uh one i think that uh you know going right back to the beginning
of like what is not a script and and where's the transparency on like on being able to look at look
at what these things actually look like i think um our wake up uh scripts is are are probably some of
the most transparent because they're the most consistent um and they're the most um uh you know
kind of there's not a lot of uh outside interaction with those scripts it's it's it's uh very much like
at the moment when you're waking up becoming conscious in the world so there's not a lot of
priors of them maybe your dreams etc um so i think it would be kind of a fun experiment to to have
people try to identify what it is their morning script actually is um identify where their first
network relationship is in that script right because maybe it's i know some people who wake up and
immediately go on their phone um uh or you know like so so then um uh try to see if they can't
pick out one part of that script that's not good for them that they don't like that's that's not
healthy um uh etc and then like you know bringing back to my question which i wanted to resolve last
last week was how do you identify the threshold events where you're able to change scripts i think
it would be a fun experiment to try to figure out like like what are the best methods for changing your
morning scripts which are definitely some of the most difficult to change good questions rj thank
you that um reminds me of somebody being asked what is your morning routine what's your bedtime routine
and i'm just projecting but a common response could be i don't have a morning routine it's like well
surely you do have a probabilistic distribution of places you wake up and how often you brush your
teeth even if it's zero percent but there's some distribution of routines there that's the script
it could be a weak script it could be a strong script but some people just brush off the question
no no i don't have a mask i don't have a routine it's like a way of not engaging with that but once
you recognize that it's about the interface and it can be a probabilistic interface just to say a
morning routine it doesn't need to be regimented it doesn't need to be externalist it also doesn't
need to be internalist we're moving beyond internalism and externalism as well as beyond
restrictive strong or loose weak we're taking all of those possibilities and now we're just thinking
yeah so what is your morning script set or maybe what what genre are your mornings um is it an emergency
movie is it a comedy and then also this question about the dependencies and to take it back to this
social network and the scripts it's like we often don't know all the dependencies until we do a
perturbation so like rj you didn't know about your lack of an alarm clock you know stimuli or script
until there was another script that changed in a non-human animal and then that had a cascading
failure in this network of dependent scripts so it revealed new relationships and dependencies
because of a manipulation and so that's very related to active inference on a few levels just to
provide one is we're always interested not just in coming to clarity on world states but actually
coming to clarity on which interventions or which experiments or perturbations would maximally inform
us while also remaining functional about those dependencies so then you could be um you know even
when the dog was still waking up early you could have been experimenting with earlier or later wake-ups
and maybe by uh bumping things by half an hour this way or another you would have discovered oh wait
without the dog i don't have a way to wake up or if the dog is tired then there's this other relationship
and nobody would connect the dog being tired to waking up early for most people especially if they
don't have a dog but in this case it could have been explored or actively inferred with um rightful
experimentation sasha um yeah that's really kind of funny about the morning routine because um yeah we of
course all have one but maybe it's uh not not very glamorous or uh effective and it just reminds me of
um these sort of uh glamorized morning routines of celebrities where like they spend um you know all
this time putting stuff on their face essentially and uh it kind of signals like i have the kind of
morning routine that i'm proud to tell other people about or should be uh you know a sensational youtube video
that other people envy um and so kind of changing yeah what a morning routine is or should be and
then also uh part of that whole like um kind of uh thinking about your morning routine is that it's
very solitary when in fact of course we wake up for other people or other creatures and that um we kind
of get sucked into someone else's script even before we know that we're part of it um like people who
wake up to take care of their kids like maybe they don't want to be waking up but you know um and then
how to use active inference in a way that um helps people modify their um morning script um in a way that i
i guess it just kind of reminds me of like biohacking and and um being very like uh focused on every
metric that you have so do you have to have all those metrics in order then to change your morning
script or like to optimize that or is there a way where active inference can help us get around that um
kind of uh self-measurement obsession that biohacking can veer off into um when it can be more focused on
just uh yeah the the performance and the human script that we're participating in good question
there sasha and it reminds me of just the imperatives in active inference being to reduce uncertainty and
to design optimal experimentation and so instead of um in this reward framework thinking we're going to
have the most rewarding morning thing it's going to set you up for the most productive day or it's
going to feel the best it's all about optimization most most most and here we're actually saying
yeah maybe we'll get there that'd be great but just where we are how could we reduce our uncertainty
like maybe every morning you wake up and you're not sure whether you're going to take mechanism a
of commute or b so how could we start by reducing uncertainty and decreasing anxiety about the coming
day increasing clarity and then asking not what is the optimal state but what's the optimal
experiment and policy that's within our scope of affordances not like waking up and instantly going
to the strange attractor of thinking that something could be a different way um we can focus on our
policies and then this beyond internalism and externalism it's just so critical because it's a
sort of the false dialectic of like worrying about oneself only and then disregarding systemic issues
versus getting extremely obsessed with systemic issues and then losing the sight of the affordances
that we do have and in the middle um is the compromised language but we're going to not just
be in the middle we're going to be all over the map and we're going to be able to dive into the
internalist thinking when we need it we're going to be diving into the externalist thinking when we
need it but we're always going to be able to return to the fullness of the niche and what's possible
and getting other people's perspectives on the issue so that's i think a a marked difference in active
inference we hope you enjoyed this week's episode and this series of discussions next week where we're
going to be moving on to a new paper so stay tuned
