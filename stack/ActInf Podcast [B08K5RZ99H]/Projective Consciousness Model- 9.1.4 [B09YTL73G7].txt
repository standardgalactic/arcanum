is provided in the episode description my name is blue knight and i will be guiding you through this
podcast which is clipped from active lab live stream number 9.1 this discussion will be loosely
structured around the paper the projective consciousness model and phenomenal selfhood
by kenneth williford daniel bennekin carl friston and david rojoff in today's episode stephen
sellette is going to start us off discussing perspectival consciousness and daniel friedman
will pick it up and facilitate this discussion about projective geometry when we started getting
into perspective painting and thinking about things that way you get this sense of how much
is it about us constructing cognition as a cultural way of being how much are we actually constructing
this relational phenomenal intentionality culturally and that then because in indigenous cultures you
see they think a lot more about shape shifting and the land being much more fluid and enfolded
um whereas we tend to have it much more linear and structured and straight-edged so there's there's some
question there about how much this consciousness becomes like a construct that we actually put on
the world yeah one um researcher who's done a lot there is the professor tanya lerman and collaborators
at stanford and she studies um like hearing voices in various uh cultures and so what is the difference
between a society that says hey the voices that you hear are your ancestors and they're telling you cool
stuff or it's a molecular thing and it's all random or it's bad voices that are actually getting into
your head that is going to be shading the experience of the people experiencing voices and so when we're
talking about consciousness what if one society they tell everyone and multi-generations it's completely
baked into their culture it's like yeah it's an illusion you know dennett topia everybody it's an
illusion and just the ideas that come to your head they're literally defined by being illusory
and you're basically just in this perpetual auto gaslighting scenario just don't worry about the
policies we're pushing on you just go with it and then another culture says actually the spark of
awareness is what should be followed even if it appears to disassociate from social norms that's
going to be a different outcome and so all of those different cultures could contain individuals
that are 100 convinced that they're right so being right isn't the same thing or thinking
you're right isn't the same thing as having an answer to the consciousness question
and yeah there's a lot of implications with how we actually are constructing our world and
our perspective so yeah i agree that was a really good point about how um it's like we're in feedback
we're doing niche modification for how we perceive and what affordances we have in the consciousness
space if you train up people in a insight meditation tradition since their children or something they're
going to have affordances in their consciousness uh it's another framework good or bad layer on top of
that with the judgment but they're depending on what people are taught about their consciousness
growing up that is going to color their experience and what affordances and what trajectories they take
later on um so very interesting stuff and i wonder like what the authors think about that or
how they conceptualize these issues so just to cover this projective geometry bit because they
write the concept of 4d four dimensional projective transformation is central to the model as it
yields an account of the link between perception imagination and multi-point of view action planning
so they're going to try to link some of the cool stuff like we've talked about in this action
perception loop we've asked where's imagination where is um imagination and speculation and all
these different things that we appear or experience engaging in and then also how do we square the circle
with the fact that we're so situated in our affordances yet we can also imagine things that
aren't seemingly uh related to our affordances like a city's grid it doesn't seem like it's tied
directly to my affordances of course in a traveling sense it is but not like it doesn't depend on where
i'm sitting in my building in a different city so geometry is about um the shape and the size of
things whereas topology is about how they're connected so in topology we talk a lot about nodes and
edges and about connectedness and structure whereas in geometry structures related to angles and sides
and edges and things like that and euclidean geometry is kind of like linear algebra is a specific uh case
of geometry where certain prerequisites are true like parallel lines don't intersect and the angles
of a triangle are 180 degrees there are non-euclidean geometries just like there are non-linear models
and non-euclidean geometries which is kind of like the out group to the exclusion of euclidean so it
includes a vast number of esoteric geometries and the way that you can move from some geometries to
other geometries is through a projection and that projection is called a map so it's kind of like
seeing the map that's in front of you it's like it's a map it maps your representation onto the territory
so this is like a map that maps one territory onto a different territory or one geometric projection
of a territory onto another so you could map between two different kinds of maps of the world you
can map between a flat one and a spherical one with certain distortions taken along and things like that
but the key mathematical features are that in the euclidean paradigm there aren't special points um
there aren't points at infinity it just is like a vast plane that doesn't end there's no horizon there
might be a angle of vision that you can't resolve below but there isn't a horizon in a flat plane
and then the art the origin is arbitrary in that every point you choose you could just say oh well
this is you know zero zero zero and the local neighborhood is exactly the same here as it is
everywhere else it's all square contrast it with non-euclidean geometries which are like
you can imagine though there are many non-euclidean types have features that include things like
special points or points at infinity like there is a ring of points at infinity and they're all
equally infinite far away there can be horizons there's um non-arbitrary origins all this kind of
stuff and they're basically going right the perspectival phenomenal space so our perspective
of what we're experiencing in a geometric understanding allows us to locate ourselves
and navigate in an ambient space that is nevertheless essentially euclidean so you can be in a 90 degree
room but you can be having this like wacky distorted hyperbolic experience of this 90 degree room and
kind of seamlessly integrating across that even if it was a bunch of cubes or connected you can climb
through it you can navigate in this euclidean world and measure the angles they're 90 degrees it's all
euclidean but your perception is still going to have this distorted effect where things closer to you
are um seemingly different than things further from you and that means that the angles as you look at
them unless you're in a very specific position will not look like 90 degrees look around the room you're
in even the corners don't look like 90 degrees um and they basically say because um the euclidean
space has no privilege points no points at infinity no horizon no non-arbitrary origin it very strongly
suggests that a non-euclidean frame must be operating with the help of sensory motor calibrations
to preserve the sense of invariance of objects across the multiple perspectives adopted and relate the
situated organism to the ambient euclidean space it's like put your hand on a 90 degree angle
you can pretty much feel from proprioception it's 90 degrees you look down it's not 90 degrees
feels normal everything's chill because we're experiencing this distortion of the euclidean space
okay i just concur with them that there's some functional attributes that
would point towards non-euclidean spaces but then every time like wait what in the how with geometry just
how is it giving us experience again i guess that's sort of the uh the question but uh yeah sasha
hi my name is sasha i'm also in california i think this is kind of trying to walk us through um
the possible you know points of view on uh consciousness that um not only does each individual
have a different perspective um necessarily in euclidean space um like we're all seeing it from different
locations let's say but that even the the mapping is different between individuals onto our own
non-euclidean you know projection of uh experience and so i think that's that's kind of many steps to
walk through to recognize how different um we see the world and how we can define this word perspective
so i think that is really uh an important aspect of understanding consciousness is uh where individual
perspective is baked into the whole process yep and it makes me think about like um let me see it
through your perspective or do you see it how i see it so we have visual metaphors for alignment and
then we have put you know walk a mile in someone else's shoes or put yourself in their shoes those are
embodied and active metaphors of understanding what else someone's experience is like and then what we're
saying here is um somehow we should integrate that how you see it and how you walk it together so that
your perspective is based upon both how you see it and the shoes that you're walking in so your actual
embedded extended body and how you walk in those shoes and there's people for whom they can't walk a
mile in any shoes so what are other metaphors that help us go beyond just simple walking to really
understand that more generally we're talking about like perception and action and that because
perception and action are linked in us in fact perspectively linked in us it's also that way in
someone else's so it's not just about coming to agreement with what they think or believe or state
they believe nor is it about specifically reenacting their action sequences which we wouldn't either
be able to do or wouldn't even have the same perspective on them as they do how are we going to
collaborate and so there's like a lot of interesting stuff and i would hope that this provides a little
bit more structure to sometimes discussions about everything from issues people disagree on to
accessibility how could we whether we um bring in projective geometry or not how could we just start
with the idea that everyone is going to have a unique perspective and then work for uh something
collective rather than get to this point where it's like well we disagree okay well now what um yeah
alex go ahead uh i hope i'm audible my name is alex i'm also in california uh this this brings up uh
it it reminds me of general relativity in a way um like conscious is some sort of uh fundamental it's a
if two folks are in different perspectives uh and they can observe the order of events occurring in
different ways or and if they can uh observe events uh occurring out of order based on their perspective
and a third remote uh thing that they're looking at uh maybe consciousness is the way of uh
uh self-observant uh of a larger system uh of a larger system when uh the system is
essentially a manifold uh uh uh the consciousness is the uh recognition of relativity in actual space
right um and this projective geometry seems to kind of be getting there um if we are unable to
observe the entire world and we're only able to observe from our perspective uh consciousness is the
recognition that that is an invariant across space and other agents uh should have the same
uh i don't know phenomena i i i really like this you said the recognition of general relativity is
consciousness and so in euclidean space it's like the invariant is angles gonna sum to 360 and this is
gonna work this way and the parallel okay so those are geometrical invariants but because the world is so
quintessentially perspectival and embedded and inactive actually the invariant is this relationship
of um action and perception and that you move in a apparently non-euclidean space
because the invariant is actually like the locus of what is generating awareness is um consciousness
and then the two examples that came to mind are first off you hear a noise with each ear at a
different um time and you hear your you know in the photons probably you know hit the lights at your
eyes at different times but also they see different things but you get a monocular perception from two
different eyes and you know but you can push one eye you can violate an expectation and you can see two
images but basically when it works it's binocular and then i was thinking of a concert where like
the base is on one side and the treble speakers are on the other and then it's like the group
they're actually hearing the events in a different order one person hears one note before the other
one and vice versa but especially locally that doesn't mean it's incoherent so what is happening
there that's kind of this group consciousness question and just thanks for bringing it to the general
relativity level because also with the general relativity um innovation it was a movement from a
cartesian newtonian euclidean all these things um movement towards like yeah maybe gravity isn't
like a non-linear force operating on a euclidean field but rather it is a non-euclidean distortion of
another thing and so there's really a lot to say there and then also there's like a lot of inroads
to quantum and consciousness whether it's hem uh hemorrhoff and penrose and about the work on
microtubules or whether it's just other more broader physics grounded theories there's so much
there about where quantum itself might fit in so a lot of points of contact there with non-euclidean
geometry perspective and um and then the fact that we don't overlap with any other system in terms of
our perspective and so then how do we take that and it's like well just like you can build a computer
in a world of general relativity can't we design information and sense making and attention systems
that work in a world where people have different perspectives i'd hope so steven
yeah i like this like really broadening the idea of relationships because i think what's really helpful
with this diagram is it and talking about the map as a way of projecting between types of spaces
rather than this idea of projections representations in the mind being projected on the world which
it's kind of the slight danger with that language you know because it gets used in that um in that
representational way if it's somehow the way that we engage a type of spatial arrangement almost bringing in
spatial cognition work but bringing it much more into the body um and i think this relates maybe some
of the work with harry heft he does some really interesting work in the world of spatial cognition
um and it'd be interesting to see his perspective on this yeah what you said about projection so that's
like in the psychotherapy it's like you're not seeing how it is you're projecting you're you know
you're you're um you're envisioning you're biased you're projecting onto the world you're projecting
that emotions onto them but it's like what if you start from hey it is a projection you are in a
projection you are the projection your experience is the projection of all these things that we're
talking about so it's like let's start from that point of view that you're not treating this person
like a robot you're assuming they're having emotions so you're engaged in this relational projection
that's intentional about your relationship so how could we connect for example optimism about the
relationship how you are going to map their facial expression onto your behavior not onto what do they
think but on how you're going to act in a certain situation that's a pretty uh different context so i
think that's like very uh interesting to bring the psychological projection the almost the psychotherapeutic
use of the term to geometric progression uh and i'm sorry geometric projection and then connecting
non-euclidean geometric projections to um general relativity and to control theory and about systems
design all these different things we hope you enjoyed this week's podcast stay tuned for next time
when we'll have one last discussion of this paper talking about the benefits of projective consciousness model
