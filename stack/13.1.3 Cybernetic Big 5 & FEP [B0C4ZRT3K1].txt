the episode description i am blue knight the host and curator of this episode which is clipped from
live stream number 13.1 this discussion is based on the 2020 paper entitled integrating cybernetic
big five theory with the free energy principle a new strategy for modeling personalities as complex
systems by adam saffron and colin de young marco lynn is going to start off this discussion about
the effects of trauma and meditation on the big five personality traits then daniel friedman is going
to jump in and facilitate so i think it's mentioned before by the two authors that that we could
uh validly see these complex systems as composed of uh different micro personalities distributed over
scale and levels um and vice and similarly for affect in in the sense written about uh by casper
has been others so um adam saffron adam also mentioned renormalization right so so i think
that ties in also to a lot of different things like stigma g or equilibration and i think perhaps
it's it's i had a thought or they wanted to share is maybe maybe um the clustering phenomenon of
personalities might be a natural consequence of something like renormalization or equilibration
if there already is a certain heterogeneity if there already is a certain kind of asymmetry
in a certain uh factors certain uh basic mechanisms of the cybernetic uh systems to shoot it throughout
uh then that naturally should cluster because then they are more likely to cooperate if it remains
heterogeneous and disordered or not co-organized uh then it's inefficient but then you have this thing
with trauma which i think would disrupt that process right because if you go back to the
components you pointed out interpretation goals and strategy then that's basically the key things
about a trauma right you're in a certain situation that just demands an extreme change in your
interpretational beliefs or models your goals for the particular situation and the extreme pressure
to have the right strategy to get out of it and i think maybe the the the the side effect right the
byproduct of that momentary extremeness is that it basically expands its influence and so it it
becomes hypersensitive by nature and so uh the ongoing the always ongoing process of equilibration of
everything co-regulating um becomes disrupted by that one participant the traumatic complex um if that
makes sense so instead of a lot of different personalities kind of equilibrating with each other
kind of polycentrically it becomes a monocentric equilibration lots of very interesting points
thank you blue and then adam
so just to kind of take the trauma aspect maybe to the other side of the spectrum and and just in
thinking about you know like our own perception of ourself right like so how we hold on to our own
like personality versus is it congruent with what others think of us so i'm thinking how does this
really relate to meditation in in meditation there's like the idea of getting rid of the
asmita right like that's the thing that builds the ego or like the construct of i so as we like
eliminate this like construct of i and also like staying in the moment right like we're not
necessarily trying to build an accurate predictive model in a meditation state so so when we have
this like it's like this dissolution of of like free energy or or or what is happening like in in the
meditative state um that can also bring about a drastic personality shift i think as we get get rid
of the eye and learn to be non-reactive as opposed to like traumatic reaction that's done non-linear
acceleration awesome adam and then marco then colin and then anyone else who wants to raise your hand
um hi i'm adam i am based out of bloomington indiana uh i'm a postdoctoral researcher
so uh let's try to address a couple of the threads it seems like a lot of the um principles of
personality uh in terms of their generality uh could be really interestingly modeled um actually
using things like ant colonies uh like in daniel's work um and you might even find interestingly like
even similar mechanisms at play so like in a recent paper starting to do active inferential modeling of
ant colony uh behavior uh decisions and foraging um daniel mentions like you know that there's like
uh the was it the foragers have more dopamine so you could see things like um the functional
significance of dopamine actually as its way of parameterizing a cybernetic system as being
potentially similar although potentially switching across scales where in the individual ants and maybe
even in the personality of the colony as a whole and uh there's would be actually this interesting
interplay between the personalities of individual ants and the personalities of colonies and this
interplay which might not be an exactly a one-for-one might actually even be a kind of um uh a
complementarity where certain characteristics being present on um this broader level this this more
encompassing markov blanket where the individuals are part of a superorganism or just the organism
um from the perspective of natural selection because the colonies that which is selected uh as daniel says
um but so the person out of the colony let's say um would then interface and interact with the
personality of uh uh the individuals of which it's composed and uh potentially in an entraining way
but potentially not um to loop around um you might even be able to uh at the level of of colony talk about
things like the affective tendencies that it's you know it's what is its what is the affect the valence
the emotions experienced by the colony as a whole in a given instance what is its um uh general mood
and then what are its patterns of mood across different situations it's and you might now
we're kind of going into what we more call personality territory and you could even think of
things like um to kind of bring in some of like marco's idea of the nature of trauma and this like
dynamic system sense like you could traumatize the colony and does it then at some point like
there you would expect some sort of like elasticity or um it's a term like history i don't know not that
but it would be you perturb it and then it it would have some sort of adaptive potential to come back
from the perturbation because that's what we're trying to do is uh keep existing in the way we are
and see some adaptive potential but you push it too far uh and then you might not get back this um
adaptive attracting structure you might get stuck in a different regime um and you could think of the
same things uh similar things this could be a way of describing things that happen within the
within uh individuals like so there's um
you can think of that maybe on multiple levels of abstraction but i'll stop for now thanks colin and
then marco go for it uh colin de young and i'm in minneapolis minnesota um i'm a
professor in the psychology department here at the university of minnesota so in terms of both this
discussion of what's going on in trauma and what's going on in meditation i think one of the
interesting things to think about again is the distinction between the personality traits and the
characteristic adaptations because in in both there's the capacity for both of them to be shifted
so marco was talking about the way in which in a traumatic event uh you are basically pre-existing
goals and interpretations and strategies are dramatically invalidated and that uh you know
then means that the system doesn't know how to pursue its goals in fact it may not even know what
its goals should be and obviously that's extremely disruptive and dysregulating and so one of the
challenges in the immediate of course is to figure out uh what you should be doing what strategies you
should be using but then there's also this capacity for that traumatic event uh to shift the underlying
sensitivities of the system to what is perceived as disruptive in future right to sensitize to to
the things that disrupt um and that is you know obviously an adapted response to say like if you're in
a dangerous environment you should become more sensitive to uh to danger and the traumatic event
just basically taught you that the world was a much more dangerous place than you thought that's part of
what is uh tragic about it right because you have this persistent sense that the world potentially is
much is much more dangerous even than it is or that you should experience it as being
but then you have the same kinds of dynamics going on in um in meditation where trying to reduce your
reactivity that's like trying to shift some of these basic parameters of the system so that you
you know react less easily you're disrupted less easily and then the kind of non-eye idea the
recognition of the the illusory nature of the eye what that's about is basically not being overly
attached to your model of yourself right because the model is the model it's not yourself so if you
are overly attached to your model then you have you're overly attached to your conscious understanding
of what your goals and your strategies are and what you're like and meditation is basically trying to
get you to recognize those ideas that you have a they're just a they're just your model they're not
actually the way that you are and b they're contingent on your situation and so you should be willing to
let them go as your situation changes and as things evolve and so it's essentially creating both a pattern
of greater flexibility in the capacity to adapt but then also the attempt to down regulate the negative
reaction to disruption right because if you have more confidence in your ability to adapt
then you should uh be less defensively reactive to disruptions because you can be confident that
you'll simply adapt to whatever the the new situation is thanks marco yeah thanks um yeah just
just uh piggybacking on that because that was really nice um yeah so so so my thoughts on meditation
and very good and important question i think um so so going back to the image of having all these
different distributed micro personalities or sub personalities i think meditation can be seen as
allowing them to manifest and arise as it often is called and manifest the expressions which are always
going on to also reach as it were the global workspace or consciousness or the conscious attention and so
what you're doing then effectively is broadening the collective of sub-agents or sub-personalities or
subsystems such that that equilibrative process improves because then you have a bigger scope a bigger
domain of possible inputs to an ongoing process of inference um and importantly this is then of
course without need for explicit modeling you don't need to explicitly label a certain um rashly or
verbally explicated belief right it's an exercise in in the in the deepest sense of it uh importantly
it's it's effectively a reflexive niche construction because meditation is systematically to basically
disattenuate to attenuate to attenuate external inputs you sit in a very neutral position you
you're in a calm environment external input is minimized and so all the inputs well it augments
the inputs that is endogenous coming from within which of course um is then going to translate or
transfer to normal waking states because those are all the endogenous or it concerns all the possible
indulges influences on your ongoing cybernetics and so it's it's it's a reflexive shift right
yeah so it's basically just a cybernetic game so from what i have seen my limited experience with
meditation and reading upon it it's it's all systematic cybernetic games it puts you in a
situation that that forces you to train the process to underlie cybernetics concerning the purely
reflexive which is of course beautiful because there's almost no opportunity for that
is an extremely exclusive state of being that exclusively uh forced you to attend to these
endogenous processes so it's kind of a cybernetics of the cybernetics if that makes sense great points
there it's why so much meditation begins with thankfulness and just to give actually one
behavioral example um let's think about the example of a circus elephant where when it's young it has a
heavy chain and it can't break away and then when it's older a simple thin rope can keep it
connected so at a first pass one might say um well why doesn't it just break away why doesn't it engage
in a policy of breaking away and the habits the e the priors over the policy the field of affordances
may not even include that as an option so if certain types of actions are down regulated so to speak by
100x before any evidence comes in then it's going to be interpreted within a prior that down regulates
or basically downweights the relevance or the likelihood of certain types of actions happening
but also there's this element of the preferences where it may through whatever mechanism it's not
an exact metaphor here the system kind of like a stockholm syndrome situation the system can actually
uh uh internalize a preference for certain states that may or may not be consciously available
during regular states of consciousness that lead into the implicit processing of everything within
a framework that results in behavior that's not aligned with something else which could be external
niche pressure or peer pressure or it could be disconcordant with one's own narrative of themselves
and then meditation is interesting to think about as far as isolating these different types of
parameters in the model and different kinds of meditation lots of different ways to do it adam it seems like
across varieties of meditation and why would you do such a thing um and ultimately like to bring back
marco's point about empowerment um it's you want to be more capable in some way having a better grip
on existence in a particular kind of way uh you want to be you have more you want to have um more degrees of
freedom uh with respect to the way you're engaging with the world and there's a sense in which you can
think of different types of meditation as either as allowing you to uh navigate through cybernetically
uh free energy free energy landscapes which can uh and and also adjust the nature of these landscapes
such that they are navigable so uh you can think of something like and to bring back in uh like
something like trauma or something like uh the elephant getting stuck you can think of this as like a
a getting stuck at a local optimum um of a potentially jagged free energy landscape and so if you can uh
let's say reduce the uh some emotional uh regulation capacity the ability to defuse from experience
and keep the gain on positive feedback group cycles of thought and emotion from getting as high as they
might uh you might be able to make the free energy landscape less jagged the differences from point to
point it's going to be uh you're not gonna have these wild swings and so this might give you greater
latitude with respect to pursuing more complex uh policies and actually i hope at some point we
start to discuss some of uh colin's work on well-being because i think it docks uh there's a lot
to be said there um but uh one thing uh on this one podcast colin was mentioning like you can think of one
of the benefits of mindfulness uh which is like in pursuing any kind of complex goal um there's going to be
a sort of trading off you're going to have to do against different things on on route there and so
if you can like temporarily uh let some of your character say adaptations slide um let some of your
uh policies like not be as important if they're if they're not being you think they ought to be
realized but they're not um within some sort of like hierarchical hierarchical policy selection
well then you can pursue uh you can hit targets you wouldn't uh otherwise you can meet your mountain
car you can get to the top of the mountain um in the mountain car problem um so yeah nice cool colin
and then anyone else i just wanted to set to point out that that's that's the essence of non-attachment
right you're not attached to particular policies and that means that you don't get hung up on a sub
goal when you should be shifting policies because what you are trying to pursue is some larger goal
there's sort of you know there's the stereotype of um meditation at the you know zen meditation for
example buddhist meditation that you're eliminating your goals right you have no desires but that's not
that is a that's a caricature right because it's not that you have no goals it's just that you're not
attached to particular low level goals you might be uh you know you probably remain attached to if
you're a good buddhist for example to eliminating suffering for all beings and so it's not like
you're not goal directed and you know you probably maintain maintain life by eating and things like
this it's just that you're not attached to the particular policies that you might be using uh to
achieve these higher level goals because goals are are just nested i mean there's a way in which
there's a goal but then the policy is also just a goal it's just there are nested goals all the way down
to the terminals which are specific motor operations or specific cognitive operations
and so non-attachment is basically becoming more flexible in which sub goals you are willing to
consider and to use very nice blue so i wonder if it's like it's more that it's not attachment to the
policy but that actually is the policy and it's not attachment to the specific generative or
predictive model i wonder if that's like because the policy is then the policy of non-attachment
to the model or ultimate model flexibility right so you could call it a meta policy
meta policy right and and so um and like secondly i wonder about uh you know the idea of staying in the
in the present moment is this like some kind of free energy equilibrium like and not necessarily
minimization but like if we take the generative model and the predictive model if we take like
the value to zero are we like is meditation like staying in the present moment just like this ultimate
state of of equilibrium in in free energy like infodynamics well interesting point about the hyper
prior the bayesian hyper prior and also that's why a lot of meditation processes involve rhythmic or the
cessation of other inputs because it allows the interoception potentially to proceed in a different way
isolation tanks or uh other altered states of consciousness so let's do adam and then marco
in terms of uh there's this one paper actually that just came out recently about a model of
meditation with respect to um the temporal depth and counterfactual richness of uh your generative
modeling uh that just came out i'll try to find that and send that um but i think that would speak
to this idea of staying in the present moment also this idea of staying in the present moment um
also makes me think of this uh mark was like kind of intimating that you can think of meditation as a
kind of uh like game task or almost like a kind of like uh maybe maybe play even uh but it's
this building capacity a building of capacity through relaxing some of your priors and so letting um
you to be uh informed by uh policies with respect to mental acts that you might not normally deploy
and you might not normally notice um what is entailed when you deploy certain types of mental acts so
things might come to mind uh that wouldn't normally uh that would place you now into a different state of
uh affective inference and so i think uh if we wanted to do uh modeling of this of something like
meditation uh we would want to use this sort of imaginative policy selection described by something
like sophisticated um affective inference and that would begin to get us there um one more thing i was
actually wondering with respect to meditation i've talked about this some with colin is uh above the
traits in the personality hierarchy you have these meta traits of stability and plasticity
and um stability is this shared variance over and uh colin actually uh named these um it's the
shared variance over neuroticism inverse neuroticism agreeableness and conscientiousness and plasticity
is the shared variance over extroversion and openness intellect and interestingly the stability seems to
be basically the inverse of the general psychopathology factor p um by and large um but i think thinking of
mindfulness and meditation with respect to um building capacities for both stability and plasticity
which um helping to uh basically place this so you can think of stability as your ability to follow
through on and protect your policies or characteristic adaptations and then plasticity would be your
tendency to form new characteristic adaptations so like whether um so let's say you do encounter trauma
um plasticity might be what makes the difference so stability would be how much it might make sense to
the degree to which you're actually traumatized like you're very stable something might you know
bounce right off you you're not traumatized but let's say you don't have a lot of plasticity
and that instability is compromised plasticity is the thing that would let you update and uh create
new strategies uh for being in the world and so they're kind of the state of dynamic tension in that
they can like pull at each other um but they're both ultimately synergistic in that like you're not
going to be particularly plastic unless you have this foundation of stability and you're not going
to be able to maintain your stability long unless you're metastable and so um part of with meditation
mindfulness i'm wondering if one way of thinking of it is it's part of what's actually really letting
you kind of like ride this optimum of balance stability and plasticity and that could be one way of
thinking about part of what um people get from it cool marco then call yeah that's amazing that
is a perfect setup yeah um i i also fully agree with this theme of complementarity right so
stability and plasticity sounds really resonates with uh plasticity sorry openness and focus which is a
big complementary uh yeah big polarity in meditation practices right so if open meditation and just feel
everything let it all come in etc focus meditation you know focus on one point one mantra um and that
has a bigger connection to the the more well-known complementarity or polarity of exploration
exploitation rights but it's not about the polarities per se it's it's always about the balancing them
off and for example sussex had also a nice paper on that it's not about perfect veridical representations
you can have some errors it's about how you balance everything off and so again we go back to the
idea notion that the meditation can be games where you effectively practice balancing that off because
that balance is not something you can explicitly verbalize it's intrinsically pre-verbal because you
can verbalize maybe the particular strategies or beliefs force ability or forplasticity but to balance
them off is more effective it's more flexible or fluid and so the another interesting maybe duality
that you can think of is also equilibriums and games or context right so in game theory you have an
equilibrium for a particular game or setting and so what you said earlier about equilibrium and staying
in the moment uh regarding meditation i think it's a very nice idea what adam already said is that
um by being in a particular game which is that meditative practice um you will naturally by free
energy minimization go to a particular kind of equilibrium but that necessitates change some
updates and those updates might actually mean that your equilibrium seeking behavior or your attractors
will be different in the other context so the underlying assumption is that these particular
changes in equilibriums or priors or attractors um are transferable so um yeah does that make sense
yeah cool thoughts colin i was just going to say a little bit more about stability and plasticity
um i think that those can be seen as the two fundamental uh needs of any cybernetic or active inference
system that exists in a complex or changing or unpredictable environment and so stability is in
some sense just the the most fundamental requirement because the system must be able to pursue its goals
effectively in order to be a cybernetic system right if it's an organism that's what it must have in
order to persist and even an artificial system in order to persist as the system that it is it must be
moving effectively toward its goals um but then if you have any degree of unpredictability in the
environment you can't just be satisfied with the same set of policies that you have at any given time
you're going to have to be able to update your policies generate new policies and so then immediately
in order to remain stable over time in a changing environment you also have to be somewhat adaptive or
plastic and so you have these uh inherent necessities for the capacity to maintain a stable order of goal
directed functioning and then the capacity to generate uh new components of the model right new
policies or even new goals or new interpretations of the of the situation that you're in and then those
so those are complementary but they can also they are also in dynamic tension as adam mentioned because
if you're massively exploratory it can be difficult to remain stable because you have so much new uh you
know information coming in um similarly if you are well i mean we've essentially already covered what
the the danger of being too inflexible and too unexploratory because you may work fine now but
as the environment changes as things change over time then you become unadapted to your situation
so stability and plasticity aren't opposite to each other right stability the opposite of stability is
instability the opposite of plasticity is rigidity you can be uh stable and plastic or stable and rigid
you can be unstable and plastic and unstable and rigid cool adam go ahead it seems like at some point
it could be good to discuss connections of narrative perspectives on personality because this idea of
um narrative is active inference and the work trying to be done there i think there could be like a rich
interchange because in some ways you can think of you know selves as centers of narrative gravity and
you can think of personality as styles and modes of narration and themes and motifs as you are this
semi-reliable narrator telling your story and making and enacting it and making it so to degrees
and this being a source of to the degree you have stability and plasticity
um this would be one source of it the ability of narratives to provide cross situational
inter-temporal common context and but also because of their richness to create this um rich this kind of
their combinatorics and rich representative capacity also being a source of plasticity and so um narrative
being a source of balance dynamic balancing this dynamic tension although the narrative itself can also not be
a source of balance but imbalance if the style of narratization um becomes problematic and so that
kind of mindfulness enters in there again where um it might like your usual styles of narrative
narratization you might let that go a bit you go um this is this is the way in which you go naive
based on your expectations um yep the stories provide the poles and the archetypes and then you can say
okay it's like goldilocks but for the internet of things or something like that and that gives you a
vocabulary to communicate and design you might need a very different story in a very different context
and kind of bring it back to trauma that might be all the difference between whether
you get stuck or you experience post-traumatic growth we hope you enjoyed this episode stay
tuned for next time where we're going to have more discussions of this paper
