Summary of The War of Art
Break Through the Blocks and Win Your Inner Creative Battles
By Steven Pressfield
By Fast Reads
Narrated by Anthony Pica
Executive Summary
Why do so many people struggle to pursue what they long to do?
Why are good intentions for beginning artistic endeavors
Often met with procrastination and self-sabotage
That leaves the would-be artist discouraged
And resentful of their innate urge to create?
In The War of Art, Steven Pressfield explores the reasons
Why so many people fail to live up to their creative potential
And explains what changes they need to make to achieve different results
Within this succinct and practical guide
Pressfield expresses his ideas in chapters as short as a few sentences
That leave the reader with a deeper understanding
Of the inner demons he must fight off in order to create
Calling this force resistance
Pressfield explores in minute detail
The way that it can derail the creator from his best intentions
And prevent his work from being actualized
By digging into his own personal battles
Overcoming the demon of resistance
Pressfield offers encouragement to the fledging artist
That hopes to create
But struggles to find the way forward within himself
No matter your calling in life
This simple book will give you pause
And force you to reflect on your own life's goals
And what stands in the way of you achieving them
Introduction
What I Do
Every writing day for Steven Pressfield
Starts with a carefully constructed routine
A ritual of lucky charms
And an invocation to the muse from the odyssey
That inspiration will come to him that day
To perform his task of writing well
After four hours of plugging forward with his work
Steven has made enough typos to indicate that he is fatigued
With that the writing is wrapped up for the day
Not to be thought of again until the next morning
Key takeaway
Overcoming resistance starts with a routine
And not taking one's own skills for granted
What I know
It's not the writing part that's hard
What's hard is sitting down to write
The difficulty of writing comes not from the challenge of knowing what to put on the page
But rather
Having the courage to sit down and do it
The reason for this difficulty is resistance
The unlived life
Most of us have two lives
The life we live
And the unlived life within us
Between the two stands resistance
We all have visions of who we might become
And who we wish to be
But few people take the necessary steps
To make these dreams come to fruition in their lives
It's easier to consider yourself a writer
Who doesn't write
Than to fight resistance to get started
An artist creates with the genius that God grants her
But a shadow is cast on that genius by resistance
This shadow may become powerful enough
To turn her from her creative endeavors permanently
Yet resistance need not cripple our lives
People diagnosed with terminal illness
Often find a will to thrive that they never knew they had
And you too have beat resistance to create your best work
Key takeaways
Listen to the small voice in your heart
Telling you to seek out your dreams
No matter the cost
Resistance will bury your every effort if you let it
Don't let it
Many activities that create meaning in our lives
Have the power to bring out resistance
Including the pursuit of any creative
Artistic endeavor
The launching of any business
A diet or health regimen
And any program designed to overcome
A negative characteristic or habit
To put it simply
Any act that seeks long-term growth over short-term gratification
Will be met with resistance
And will be difficult to overcome
Key takeaway
If anything is worth doing
You can assume you will encounter resistance
As you strive for it
Resistance is invisible
Though resistance cannot be understood through our senses
It can be felt as an energy field that radiates around the work we strive to do
Resistance is a negative force
Repelling and distracting us from the work we yearn to do
Resistance is internal
Resistance comes from within ourselves
Though we often wrongly assume that it comes from outside sources like our jobs
Spouses or other busy aspects of our lives
Key takeaway
Resistance is self-generated and self-perpetuated
To blame it on an outside force
Is to deny the root of the problem
Resistance is insidious
There is nothing that resistance won't tell you
To prevent you from doing your work
It has no qualms or conscious
And it is quick to double-cross you
When you agree to its conditions
If you believe the empty promises of resistance
Then you deserve what you get
Resistance is implicable
Resistance is like a virus
Programmed to accomplish one mission only
To turn you away from your work
There is no turning it from this end goal
Because this is its only nature
Resistance is impersonal
There is nothing personal about the way that resistance attacks your creativity
Rather, it is a force of nature that acts with indifference and objectivity
You are not being targeted
Key takeaway
Your anger at resistance is misdirected
Rather, be upset with yourself for allowing it to permeate your creativity
Resistance is infallible
Resistance can be used as a compass to gauge our inner yearnings
For whatever it is fighting against the most in our lives
Is what we need to pursue more passionately
Key takeaway
The more important something is for us to accomplish our work towards
The more resistance will seek to pull us away from it
Resistance is universal
It is not just artists striving to create that struggle with resistance
But rather every being with a body
Resistance never sleeps
Mastering resistance is a lifelong battle
For even the seasoned stage performer is overcome with nerves before every play
The battle to overcome resistance must be fought anew every single day
Resistance plays for keeps
Simple wounding or disabling our project is not enough for resistance
Instead, it aims to kill
It targets the priceless center of our being and tries to terminate it forever
A fight with resistance is to be waging a war to the death
Resistance is fueled by fear
The only strength that resistance has is given to it by us
Our fear of its potential is the only power that it needs to grow
Key takeaway
If you can master your fear of resistance, you can conquer it
Resistance only opposes in one direction
Resistance is not indiscriminate in the ways it obstructs your goals
Rather, it will only impede your work when you strive to move from a lower sphere of existence to a higher one
Resistance is most powerful at the finish line
The end steps of your project are the most opportune for resistance to intervene
As Odysseus was blown back to sea when he was within sight of his home
So resistance will give a final assault as you near the corner of your project
Key takeaway
Be alert for the final attack of resistance and stay strong through it
Resistance recruits allies
Resistance by definition is self-sabotage
But there's a parallel peril that must also be guarded against
Sabotage by others
It is a strange reality for a writer to face that often, as soon as she starts to achieve success
Those around her might begin to become unnecessarily critical of her progress
This is an attempt to sabotage
They see her progress as a threat to their own views of success and, like crabs in a bucket
Would rather keep her in the bottom of the pail with them than make an attempt to be free
Key takeaway
The best thing that an artist can do to others stuck in resistance is to be an inspiration
Don't take their negative responses to heart
They are simply resentful of your escape
Resistance and procrastination
Procrastination is an easy manifestation of resistance because, by putting off what you can do today until tomorrow
It prevents us from facing the reality that our work will never be done
Resistance and procrastination
Part 2
Without our knowledge or consent, procrastination can quickly become a habit
Slowly, the longing of our hearts is put off day after day until we reach our very deathbed
Key takeaway
You can change the direction of your life the very second you sit down and begin to work
Resistance and sex
Resistance has found a powerful ally in sex
Because sex provides immediate gratification
And can turn us away from our work that only promises reward long in the future
This power also reveals itself in activities like shopping, drugs, TV, alcohol and a hundred other easy distractions
Key takeaway
Understand your motivation for an easy thrill
Is it really love or a mindless distraction?
Resistance and trouble
Why is trouble such an effective form of resistance?
Because it's easier to distract yourself with problems of your own making than to finish the daunting task in front of you
Key takeaway
Banish all sources of trouble from yourself and harness the urge that longs for trouble into your work
Resistance and self-dramatization
It can be just as easy to gain attention from bad life decisions as from artistic success
But only one form provides you with the lasting pride
Hooking yourself up to a vicious cycle of self-dramatization
Is a perfect way to ensure that you will never get anything of real importance done
Resistance and self-medication
Oftentimes the medication we take to escape things like anxiety and depression
Are simply a way to escape the powers of resistance
Though depression is a real disease with deadly consequences
Attention deficit disorder, social anxiety disorder, and others were discovered not by doctors
But by copywriters and pharmacists eager to create a new market for their products
Key takeaway
Don't mislabel resistance as depression
Taking drugs to blot out a calling of your soul will not leave you fulfilled
Resistance and victimhood
Most of the work that doctors do on a given day is not health related
Simply because the majority of their patients aren't sick
But rather are self-dramatizing
Casting yourself as a victim of a medical ailment
Is a sure way to give in to resistance
And create yourself an excuse for not doing your work
Key takeaway
If you take pleasure in casting yourself as a victim of your situation
Come to terms with the fact that your work will never get done
Resistance and the choice of a mate
A person unable to face their own resistance
Often finds themselves with a mate that has mastered theirs
This is because it is easier to live vicariously through a partner
Than to master one's own deep-seated problems
But this isn't love
And it will not last
Key takeaway
You can't rely on someone else's health to soothe your own resistance
You must fight your own battle
Resistance and this book
This very book was almost beaten by resistance
Pressfield was reminded that he was a writer of fiction
Not self-help
And that the form of this book was all wrong for revealing the temperament of resistance
The power of this resistance almost prevented him from starting
But the unhappiness of not trying was greater than the fear of failure
And so he sat and wrote
Key takeaway
Even the pros must overcome resistance
Resistance and unhappiness
Resistance manifests itself as unhappiness
And a deep-seated discomfort for life
The would-be artist finds herself bored and restless
Turning to web surfing and alcohol to fill the void
Past a certain point
Resistance becomes depression
Aggression
And general dysfunction
It is the artist's responsibility to learn that healing will come from within
And that the distractions of a consumerist culture will never satisfy
Key takeaway
The unhappiness in your work isn't a fact of life
It's a fact of resistance
Resistance and fundamentalism
Those who will not govern themselves are condemned to find masters to govern over them
Human beings are not wired to function alone
But rather in groups with others
The despair that the modern individual feels
From being cut away from the familiar ties of the clan and village structure is real
Living with freedom is extremely difficult
It's entirely possible that humanity isn't ready for it yet
However, that doesn't mean that it's not worth the journey to find it
This book wouldn't have been written if living in freedom was easy
Key takeaway
As Socrates revealed
The individual can only be as free as their level of self-mastery
Resistance and criticism
Watching others start to live their own authentic lives
Can drive those left behind crazy
And extensive criticism towards their success is likely caused by resistance
If your own life has been fully realized
You will feel little need to criticize others
Key takeaway
Though most forms of resistance will harm only yourself
Criticism has the ability to hurt those around you
Resistance and self-doubt
Self-doubt doesn't have to be the enemy
Rather, it is a gauge of whether you are pursuing what you ought
If you need to ask if you are really a writer, then odds are you are
The problem comes when you are full of confidence for your innovations because the genuine creator is terrified
Resistance and fear
Scared of your project?
That's the best sign you will receive that it is something you need to do
Fear is an indicator that you are on the right path
Resistance often manifests itself as fear
Which explains why the projects that mean the most to us can be met with so much fear
To be a true professional, be sure to take on projects that will stretch you and put the fear of God in your heart
These are the projects that will make you who you are
Key takeaway
The more scared you are of the work in front of you, the more confident you can be that it needs to be done
Resistance and love
The opposite of love is indifference, not hate
If you don't feel strongly about a project or have resistance towards working on it, you will not find it within yourself the love necessary for it to succeed
Key takeaway
The more resistance to face about a project, the more joy you will get from the process and completion of it
Resistance and being a star
Only amateurs daydream of success
The professional puts in the work each day and finds that success, when it comes, is only a by-product
By concentrating on the work at hand, the professional becomes his own measurement of success
Resistance and isolation
Projects seem daunting to the amateur that must be undertaken alone
But the professional knows that he is never truly alone
As soon as we step away from those around us, our inner muse begins to lead us down the path
This path can rarely be shared with others for risk of compromising its integrity
But the professional will know when he is on it
Time will roll past in a wave and the creator will have little sense of solitude
For their own heads are so consumed with their own creation
Resistance and isolation
Part 2
Writers rarely feel lonely in the midst of their works because they are surrounded by the characters of their own making
Often times they appear more vivid and interesting to the writer than the people of their own lives
Even in non-fiction pieces, the writer has the joy of imagining the reader of his piece
And for this reason, will continue through his work with the sense of being in a room surrounded by kindred souls
Resistance and healing
In many cases, the pursuit of healing is a form of resistance
The athlete knows that he will play with pain
So why does the artist expect to be able to create without difficulty?
Healing can be an avoidance technique to stop the pain that comes from creation
That part of us is down too deep to be damaged by the situation of our lives
In fact, this piece of us only becomes richer through hardship
What needs healing are aspects of our personal lives
And these pieces of ourselves are not connected to other creation sides
We all need healing
That is understood
But don't fall under the assumption that you need healing before you can create
Key takeaway
Don't get lost in the pursuit of cures when you should be creating instead
Resistance and support
One of the best ways to encourage resistance in your creative field
Is to attend a workshop devoted to mastering it
What better way to avoid the real work?
Have the courage to say enough with lessons and practice
And to go for your dreams with wholehearted abandon
Key takeaway
Don't let the process of prepping get in the way of putting in the real work
Resistance and rationalization
Rationalization is resistance's right-hand man
Its job is to keep us from feeling the shame we would feel if we truly faced what cowards we are for not doing our work
Don't rationalize your procrastination or other reasons why you have yet to create what you are capable of
Rationalization is the worst form of lying to ourselves
Resistance and rationalization
Part 2
Resistance is often fear
But it tries to hide itself from us
So that we don't feel shame for our fears and change our behaviors
Rather it manifests itself as rationalization
So that we can be faced with plausible rational justifications for why our work remains untouched
Many if not most rationalizations are true
There will always be logical reasons to justify not doing your work
But that hardly matters
The greats of history have accomplished their best work under incredibly trying circumstances
And so can you if you let yourself
Key takeaway
Your rationalizations are never an excuse
Resistance can be beaten
The great works of history are proof that resistance can be beaten
The work in front of you might seem impossible
Until you remember that thousands have done it before you
And thousands will do it after you
Book 2
Combating resistance
Professionals and amateurs
Any artist whom has been defeated by resistance is still an amateur
The differences between the professional and the amateur
Are the differences between someone who plays for fun and who plays for keeps
While the amateur dabbles in his craft part-time
The professional is in it for the long haul
A professional
Pros don't set their schedule by when inspiration hits
Rather, they work each day in such a way to allow inspiration to come into their lives
Key takeaway
Build the foundation for inspiration into your routine
And it will come
What a writer's day feels like
The professional writer will feel annoying inside
Until he has time to be alone
And work on his craft
The chores of daily life just barely snatch his mind away from the work at hand
The writing work day begins as a hunt
The writer tromps through the woods in endless pursuit of the elusive hare
Whether the writer will find what he seeks is unknown
But it never prevents his feet from trudging forward
When the hunt meets success and the day's work is done
The writer has but a moment to relax
Before turning his mind to the tasks ahead tomorrow
Key takeaway
Know the difference between what is urgent and what is important
And always do what is important first
How to be miserable
In many ways, being an artist is similar to signing up for the Marines
Both require suffering, isolation, a lack of control over your own actions
And a life riddled with misery from self-doubt and despair
Yet, both the Marine and the artist must seek out misery
They must love it
Only out of such misery can beautiful works be created
Key takeaway
Learning how to be miserable is an invaluable skill for an artist to possess
We're all pros already
If you have a job that pays you a steady paycheck
You are already a pro
There are plenty of lessons that you can take from your professional life
And turn towards your professional artistic life instead
You show up every day
You show up no matter what
You stay on the job all day
You are committed over the long run
The stakes for you are high and real
You need to accept remuneration for your work
You don't over-identify with your job
Key takeaway
If you treat your art like your job, soon enough it will be
For the love of the game
Though the professional is happy to receive money for his work
Overall he works out of love
Resistance loves pride
And will try to convince you your work is not worthwhile without a paycheck
The professional knows better
A professional is patient
The amateur is undone by resistance with its own enthusiasm
Eager to jump into an overly ambitious project
The amateur burns out and crashes
The professional, in turn, works with delayed gratification
He puts in his work every day
And lives with the confidence that someday it will pay off
The professional experiences less burnout
And is confident enough to say no when the project doesn't fit his abilities
A professional seeks order
A professional has a mission to accomplish every day
And cannot tolerate disorder around his craft
By eliminating chaos from his work
He can banish it from his mind
A professional demystifies
A professional doesn't wait for inspection
But rather works within her craft day in and day out
It is the amateurs that are preoccupied with the mystery of artistic creation
A professional acts in the face of fear
A professional knows that fear can never truly be overcome
And instead chooses to work in the face of fear
Only by starting her work the professional knows will fear go away
A professional accepts no excuses
The amateur allows illness or circumstances to get in the way of their creation
While the professional understands that this is the temptation of resistance
He knows that giving in today makes it far harder to complete his work tomorrow
And because of this, he puts in his work day after day
A professional plays it as it lays
As a golf player knows that they need to play with, not against the wind
A professional knows that they must conduct their work within the realm of the real world
Good and bad conditions are entirely outside of their control
And instead the professional must learn to work within the realm that he has
A professional is prepared
Every day a professional confronts his craft
He is fighting off self-sabotage
This involves extensive mental preparation
To combat whatever resistance might throw at him
In the end, all a professional can master is himself
And he works towards this end every day
A professional does not show off
The style of a professional serves his material
It does not become a crutch for him to depend on
However, he is entirely allowed to change his style
Entirely when the moment calls for it
A professional dedicates himself to mastering technique
To the professional, mastering technique is not about substituting skill for inspiration
But rather, a way to add to his toolbox of skills
By working hard on technique, the professional knows that he is paving the way for genius to enter in
A professional does not hesitate to ask for help
The professionals always have something that they can learn from others
Even Tiger Woods had a coach for his entire professional golf career
Only amateurs think they know their craft well enough to go without advice
A professional distances herself from her instrument
And does not overly identify herself with it
She must give herself the distance from her tools to be able to assess them coolly
Impersonally and objectively
A professional does not take failure or success personally
The fear of rejection is a crushing fear that can be difficult to overcome
And resistance knows how to use it against us
If the amateur can somehow overcome the fear of creating their work
They will likely shy away from presenting it to the public
A professional knows not to take rejection personally
Critics are not the enemy
Resistance is
The only way to overcome resistance is to reveal her work for the world to see
Key takeaway
Rejection isn't personal
And it's not a sign of failure
It only means you had the audacity to try
A professional endures adversity
To become a professional
Rejection is bound to come your way at some point
Endure it
Fight through it
Your best work is yet to be made
Key takeaway
Don't take humiliation personally
It's only an external reflection of your internal resistance
A professional self validates
Only amateurs take external criticism to heart
Professionals have the tough-mindedness to understand the intrinsic value of their work
And to continue working towards it
No matter what distractions come their way
The professional is as focused on the task at hand
As Tiger Woods is in the final shot of a tournament
Key takeaway
Don't let resistance cede your sovereignty to another
You are in control of your own response
A professional recognizes her limitations
The professional will be the first to ask for help because she has a strong sense of her
own talents and weaknesses
A professional reinvents himself
The muse of every artist might have different roles for them during their lifetime
A true professional prevents themselves from getting caught into one manifestation of their talents
And rather explores the other paths that his talents can take him on
A professional is recognized by other professionals
A professional can recognize another professional on-site
Because he will always be able to tell who has served his time
You ink
Whether or not you incorporate yourself
It pays off to think of yourself as an organization
This mindset separates you from the professional and the personal
And allows you to maintain the integrity of your business
In the midst of success or criticism
Key takeaway
Leave the emotional work to your personal life
And maintain a rational business mindset for the rest
A critter that keeps coming
The professional can beat resistance because he is tenacious
He keeps coming back for more
Eventually beating resistance at its own game
No mystery
In short, there is no mystery to turning pro
It is a decision made through willpower
And the simple courage to show up every day
Book 3
Beyond Resistance
Angels and the Abstract
In this section, Stephen uses the narrative of Angels and the Abstract
To help visualize impersonal forces that impact our lives
These forces can be our allies and our greatest hindrances
When it comes to perfecting our crafts
The single most important part of creating art is to sit down every day and work at it
Only through grinding out work hour after hour can heaven start to come to our aid
Sitting down and getting to work forges us into a lightning rod that attracts ideas for farther projects
Invoking the muse
Never take advantage of where your inspiration comes from
Before he sits down every day to work, Stephen invokes the blessings of the muse of inspiration
Only then does he feel fit to begin
Writing takes incredible concentration and effort
Living in a house without radio, TV, and other distractions for weeks on end is still no guarantee that your work will be published
And even so, the writer must persevere
Invoking the muse, part 2
Invoking the muse, part 2
The way that the Greeks personified talent and inspiration was to create their gods and the muses
Native cultures around the world personified animals from the natural world
This may seem ridiculous to our modern sensitivities
But it's hard to explain the brilliant creations of past generations in any other way
Testament of a visionary
Eternity is in love with the creation of time
William Blake
The visionary William Blake understood the power of the muse and the magic of slowly working on a project for an infinite amount of time
As a muse whispers inspiration into our receptive ear of an artist
So does brilliance hit the craftsman that takes the time to understand their work
Invoking the muse, part 3
There is great humility in the artist who can reject the total power of their talents
And instead ask for help from those around them
Thinking that we can go about our creative endeavors alone is asking for ruin
The magic of making a start
Starting on a project is to invite the angels from heaven to come down to us and whisper their inspiration into our ears
When we get down to work, we get out of our own way and allow the angels around us to enter our lives and impart their wisdom
The magic of keeping going
The process of self-revision and self-correction is so important
Yet so common that it barely registers as important for us
However, at the end of a long work day, the artist might find whispers in his ear about the small, nuanced changes he should make the next day
The back of the artist's mind is always scanning
Organizing the creations of the day in an attempt to make them better
Is this the artist himself or the power of the muse?
The small voice certainly seems smarter than the artist
Largo
Dreams can signify powers within us that we never expected to be able to have
Stephen's dream about manning a ship with a captain named Largo
Electrified him to the idea that he had the power to take back control of his own life
We all have dreams like this
Telling us that our lives touch more than we can ever imagine
It's up to us to learn to interpret these dreams for the truths they reveal
Life and death
Sometimes the greatest works of our lives come when we realize we don't have much time
Faced with imminent extinction, we begin to question the meaning of our lives and the ways that we want them to be expressed
The woman diagnosed with cancer might finally start writing the book she had been dreaming of for years
Key takeaway
Sometimes the ending of our lives is the motivation we need to begin them
The Ego and the Self
Stephen believes that angels have settled themselves into the Self while resistance seats itself within the Ego
The internal power struggles of our lives remain between these two forces
Experiencing the Self
In contrast to the Ego, the Self is the deepest part of our being
It is the part of us that touches upon divine ground
Our best dreams and ideas come from this part of our spirit
And it's the part that we seek out through meditation and mindfulness
The Ego hates the Self and uses resistance to attack it
Fear
Resistance gorges itself on our fears of the consequences of following our hearts
It's the fear of failure, of waste, and of disappointment
But most importantly, it is the fear that we might succeed
That we might become the person that we sense in our hearts we truly are
Is the most terrifying reality that a human can face
Not the least because it thrusts us into the world as an individual and not as a tribe member
Key takeaway
Your greatest fear might be success itself
The authentic self
One look at very young kids is proof that the idea of being born with a blank slate is false
We all come into this world with our own personal talents and destinies to fulfill
It's up to us to devote our lives to the task of finding them
Territory vs. Hierarchy
We are all born into the hierarchical narrative and know where we fit in with the rest of our pack
Only later in life are some able to branch out enough to live by the territory model
And for those that find it, it can be enough to save their lives
All of modern society is set up to embrace the organization of a hierarchical orientation
However, this model is flawed and outdated because a hierarchy stops working after a community exceeds several hundred
In the age of mass society, this model is only serving to make us feel more lost and confused than ever
The artist and the hierarchy
For the artist especially, being designated into the hierarchical system is often fatal
This is because someone that must define themselves by their place in the pecking order
Needs to be in constant competition with those around him
And the level of his happiness and success will be directly connected to his rank
A hierarchical system forces the artist to look outward
Wondering what each person around him can do for him to advance his standing
And in doing so, he fails to look within
The definition of a hack
A hack is an artist that creates with his audience in mind
Not to soothe the longings in his heart
Being a hack can pay off big time financially, but often at the cost of the artist's integrity
And oftentimes, an artist will find that the work where he is most true to his inner longings
Is the most successful financially as well
The territorial orientation
The territorial orientation is a preferred one for the artist
Because it keeps them in competition only with themselves
A territory doesn't require external comparison
Or a constant evaluation of where your place is in the pack
Rather, it allows you to get a return on exactly what you put in
The artist and the territory
Both the mother and the artist act within a territory
Because they are fully responsible for what they are creating
And it is fully contained within them
A mother knows that she did not create the new life inside her
Rather, she is only a vehicle through which it has been nurtured
Likewise, an artist knows that they are not the originator of their works
But only the vessel that is used to bring it into the world
The difference between territory and hierarchy
You can know whether you are operating within a territorial or hierarchical framework
When you look to where you seek solace and trouble
If you turn towards others, you are within a hierarchy
But if you turn towards yourself and can rely on yourself
You are in a territory
Ask yourself
If I was the last person on earth, would I still create this art?
If so, you are operating within a territory
The supreme virtue
The supreme virtue for an artist is a contempt for failure
The fruits of our labor
A true artist understands that the origins of their work
Come not from themselves, but from a higher power all around them
The inspiration for their work comes from heaven itself
And it is only fitting that the artist gives it back
An artist must be willing to give his work back freely to the source
From which it came from
And give the heavens the credit for all of it along the way
Portrait of the artist
Put simply, the artist is a servant of the muses
And the enemy of the ego and resistance
An artist is a warrior
Fighting every day for their craft
Constantly overwhelmed with humility
That they have been granted the ability to work with it
An artist knows that she is only a vessel of the God she serves
The artist's life
How do you know if you should or shouldn't follow your calling towards the arts?
Remember, if you don't follow your true calling
You are hurting others as well as yourself
You shame the angels that watch over you and spite the God that created you
Key Takeaway
Creative work is not inherently selfish or a bid for attention
It's a gift to the world and everyone that takes part in it
Give what you can
