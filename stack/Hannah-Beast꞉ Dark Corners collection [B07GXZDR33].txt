Halloween, 1982
Please, Hannah, please come out with us tonight.
It won't be like before, we promise.
Please, please, please, please, say you'll be our friend again and come with us.
We'll get candy, so much candy,
whole pillowcases stuffed full of Kit Kats, peanut butter cups, Mars bars.
So much sugar, we won't sleep for a week.
Trust us, Hannah.
Come with us, Hannah.
It'll be a night you won't ever forget.
Halloween, 2016
There's no way you're leaving the house like that.
Amanda spoke in her flat, level, I'm the mom here tone,
doing her best to hide the shaking in her voice.
Really?
She wanted to scream.
Scream not in fury, but horror.
She wanted to run from the kitchen and hide in her bedroom,
slamming the door maybe, like she was the teenager.
Her skin prickled with cold sweat.
Her stomach churned.
She worked to steady her breathing as she made herself look at her daughter,
take in the whole grotesque costume.
It was like some hole had been ripped in time.
And Amanda was 12 years old again,
dressed in her lame cat burglar costume with a striped shirt and pillowcase money bag,
handing her mask over so that Hannah Beast's costume would be complete.
Thanks, Amanda Panda.
Aaron's face was painted blue with thick grease paint.
There was a black plastic eye mask held in place by elastic.
A pink feather boa.
A silver cape.
Topping it all off was a rainbow clown wig.
Jesus, how many rainbow clown wigs did the drugstore in town sell each Halloween?
The costume was spot on.
A near exact replica, with the exception of the face paint.
It was the wrong shade of blue and too thick.
The real Hannah Beast had worn makeup that was thin, patchy.
A dull pale blue that had made her look cyanotic.
This is totally unfair, Aaron said.
I thought you were going as a cat.
I'm a cat every fucking year, Mom.
This was a new thing for Aaron, the swearing all the time.
She'd never done it, back when Jim was here.
He wouldn't have stood for it.
But Amanda had decided to ignore it.
To ride it out and let Aaron blow off steam by dropping a few F-bombs here and there.
Take your battles, Amanda told herself.
And besides, didn't letting the swearing slide make her the cool mom,
as opposed to the uptight dad?
The dad who had walked out on them four months ago,
claiming Amanda was too distant, too walled off,
and he couldn't live his life with a woman he didn't know how to reach.
You know the rules, Amanda said to her daughter.
You are not going out like that.
Your rules suck and make no sense, Aaron said with disgust.
They're totally arbitrary.
Aaron always thought she could win an argument if she used big words.
Jim had often let himself be distracted or amused.
Not Amanda.
Amanda said nothing.
It's my last year of trick-or-treating, Aaron whined.
Next year, she'd be a freshman in high school.
Why do you have to ruin it?
Her voice broke a little bit, and Amanda thought Aaron might start crying.
She cried a lot lately, mostly while fighting with Amanda over perceived unfairnesses.
It had been so much easier when she was younger,
crying over a scraped knee or some hardship she'd endured at school,
not getting enough turns on the big slide,
or her teacher saying she hadn't shown her work properly on a math worksheet.
Then, all problems could be solved with a hug.
Give me one of your boa constrictor hugs, Mommy.
Real tight, like you'll never let me go.
And a trip to the ice cream shop,
where they'd split a cookie dough sundae with extra whipped cream.
Now, Amanda took in a breath, forced a smile.
That's my job.
Fun ruiner.
Aaron stared at her through her mask,
her eyes angry and a little desperate.
They could have been the real Hannah Beast's eyes.
Amanda, the eyes pleaded.
Amanda Panda, please, don't let them do this to me.
Amanda had to look away,
glancing over at the kitchen island,
where the pumpkin they'd bought last week at the farmer's market still sat,
uncarved.
Pumpkin carving had always been Jim's job,
a task he'd taken seriously,
downloading templates from the internet,
spending hours cutting out perfect cat faces,
witches flying on brooms,
and one year, a raven,
with intricate feathers and glowing eyes.
Go change,
Amanda told her daughter.
Now.
Aaron sighed dramatically.
Can you just explain why?
Can you be that fair?
Every year since she was in third grade,
Aaron had asked to go as Hannah Beast.
She'd seen the older kids doing it a handful each year,
and she'd heard the stories.
How the real Hannah Beast came back each year at Halloween,
came back with a box of matches in her pocket,
so you better look out,
better be careful,
better hope you didn't run into her.
She was a crazy ghost girl,
Hannah Beast was.
She'd killed in life,
and she'd kill again in death,
given half a chance.
But the stories were just that.
Stories.
Myths.
With pieces of truth hidden inside.
Over the years,
Aaron had seemed eager for these nuggets of truth.
But Hannah Beast was a real girl,
right?
Aaron would ask.
Yes.
Amanda would tell her.
A girl who died a long time ago.
Yes.
And she set a fire?
Amanda would nod,
always having to look away.
Yes.
She'd say,
the same reply she'd given hundreds of times,
beginning back when she was Aaron's age.
And the police first questioned her about it.
And people died?
Yes.
Did you know her, Mom?
Aaron would ask,
eyes wide and hopeful.
Did you know the real Hannah Beast?
No.
Amanda would say.
The lie so practiced it rolled off her tongue
in a loose and natural way.
I didn't know her at all.
But the stories were just that.
Stories.
Myths,
with pieces of truth
hidden inside.
She looked at her daughter now
in her blue face paint.
Thirteen years old,
gangly as a scarecrow.
Please, Mom.
Aaron said,
voice quiet and pleading now.
Seriously,
it's not fair.
At least tell me why.
Because,
Amanda said,
pausing for a moment to breathe
and keep her tone calm.
Because I said so.
Aaron shook her head
to express her utter contempt,
the bright rainbow wig slipping slightly.
She stomped off,
out of the kitchen
and up the stairs to her room,
slamming the door
with impressive force.
Amanda went into the living room
and sank down into the couch.
Eyes focused on the overflowing bowl
of brightly wrapped candy
in a plastic pumpkin bowl.
Aaron came downstairs
half an hour later,
face cleaned of blue makeup,
replaced by cat whiskers
drawn with eyeliner,
cherry red lipstick.
She wore black leggings,
a black hoodie,
and a headband
with furry black ears
gone mangy
from one too many Halloweens.
She had on her school backpack,
which would soon be stuffed
with candy,
popcorn balls,
and glow sticks
given out by the police officers
who were out in full force
each Halloween.
As if by sheer numbers,
they could ward off
what was coming.
The small army of Hannah beasts
the little fires
all over town.
Dumpsters,
trash cans,
vacant buildings,
the old salt shed.
And somehow,
they never managed
to stop
a stuffed effigy
of Hannah beast
from being hung
by a noose
from the town gazebo
each year.
Loth body
stuffed full of newspapers
and rags,
pillowcase face
painted blue,
rainbow wigs
stapled on,
pink boa
ruffling in the breeze
as the creepy doll
swung in circles
from the thick rope.
Aaron went straight
to the front door,
passing Amanda
in the living room
without a word.
There was a rapid fire knocking
and she flung the door open.
Her friends were gathered
on the front porch.
They must have texted Aaron
that they were there.
Two Hannah beasts,
Wonder Woman,
and a red devil
in a too tight,
too short dress.
Aaron walked out
and slammed the door
behind her,
but not quickly enough
to drown out
the first word
she spoke.
I fucking hate
my mother.
1982.
Please,
Hannah,
please
come out
with us tonight.
The three girls
cooed like
sweet little doves,
funny partridges,
as they stood
gathered outside
her first floor
bedroom window.
They knew better
than to come
to the front door,
deal with Daddy
and his fire-breathing
bourbon breath,
telling them
they weren't good girls.
They were trash,
little dipshit whores.
Girls like that,
they're going
straight to hell.
That's what Daddy said.
You stay away from them,
unless you want
to get burned.
Their porch light
was dark,
no smiling jack-o'-lantern
to greet trick-or-treaters,
no bowl of candy
waiting by the front door.
Hannah bit her lip,
looking through the screen
at the girls
gathered outside,
smiling in at her
from the shadows,
begging,
please,
please,
please.
It won't be
like before,
we promise.
Please say
you'll be our friend
and come with us,
they begged.
Hannah shook her head,
I'm not supposed to.
It was more than the fact
that her daddy
would skin her alive
if he caught her
going out with these girls.
It was that
she didn't trust them,
not one bit.
They'd given her
dog biscuits,
telling her they were
oatmeal cookies,
then barked out
their own laughs,
saying,
Hannah's a dog,
bow-wow dog face,
bow-fucking,
well.
Then she cried,
actually cried,
and they'd said
they were sorry,
sorry,
so, so,
sorry.
It was a joke,
just having a little fun
is all.
Some days,
they took her lunch money,
saying it was a tax
she had to pay,
and if she didn't pay it,
they wouldn't be
her friends anymore,
wouldn't let her sit
with them,
not ever.
Not like they did
all that much anyway.
Mostly,
she was greeted
with disgusted
snarls of,
go away,
Hannah.
The worst
was the time
they tried to turn her
into a real girl.
Trust us,
Mel said.
We'll make you pretty.
You want to be pretty,
don't you,
Hannah?
And they took her
to Katie's house,
where they made her
soak in a tub
full of
pretty girl bath salts
that made her
break out
in a hot rash
all over her body.
Then,
they coated her legs
with shaving cream,
and Mel shaved her
with a pink razor,
saying,
You've got quite
the pelt going on here,
Hannah.
What are you,
a wolf girl?
And Hannah
had bared her teeth,
laughed,
and said,
Maybe I am.
Maybe I'm going
to eat you up.
She gave them a growl
deep in her throat
and snapped her jaws
at Mel,
made like she was
going to bite her.
This had startled Mel,
or maybe she just
pretended to be startled.
Maybe she slipped
on purpose.
The next thing Hannah knew,
she was dripping blood
down her leg,
not like little
weeping dots,
but like a spring stream
that runneth over.
Fuck,
Mel said,
Sorry.
But then she smiled
ever so slightly,
and shot a quick glance
at Manda and Katie,
and Hannah knew
she wasn't sorry.
Not one bit.
Hannah still had the scar.
It's Halloween, Hannah,
Manda said now,
pleading.
She was dressed up
like a cat burglar
with a striped shirt
and watch cap,
a black mask,
and a pillowcase
with a huge dollar sign
drawn on the outside.
Katie was a girly clown,
a feather boa
draped around her shoulders.
And Mel,
she was some kind of
superhero space princess
with a silver dress,
tall black boots,
a silver cape,
a tiara,
and a big plastic laser gun
strapped to her back.
Don't you want candy?
Katie asked
as she stood
shoulder to shoulder
with Mel.
We'll get candy.
So much candy.
Whole pillowcases
stuffed full of Kit Kats,
peanut butter cups,
Mars bars.
So much sugar
we won't sleep
for a week,
Mel promised.
Then we can swap,
Manda said.
I know you love
peanut butter cups.
I'll give you
all of mine.
Hannah let herself
imagine it,
roaming the streets,
going door to door
with these girls,
opening her sack up
and watching the candy
fill it
until it was heavy,
so heavy
that it was hard
to carry,
bulging with chocolate,
lollipops,
wax lips,
candy she'd never
even heard of,
never even tried.
Come with us,
Mel said.
Come with us,
Katie begged,
an echo of Mel,
which was how
Hannah thought of her,
not a person
all her own,
just an echo.
Whatever Mel said,
Katie did.
Whatever Mel wore,
Katie wore.
She even brought
the same kind of
sandwich as Mel
to school each day,
peanut butter and fluff
with the crust cut off.
Hannah looked at Manda,
the only one
she half trusted.
She'd been to Manda's
house before,
spent the night
once even.
It had been
during February break
and the other girls
were away.
Hannah knew
this would never
have happened
if they'd been around,
if there'd been
even the slightest
possibility
that they'd find out.
Manda's house
was big
and beautiful.
Her parents
were real nice,
too.
They took Hannah
and Amanda
to the video store,
let them pick out
whatever they wanted.
then they stopped
at the grocery store
and bought a pan
of popcorn
that they cooked
on the stovetop,
pop, pop, pop,
and the foil over it
puffed up as it filled,
turning it into
a crinkly metallic mushroom.
She and Manda
made pink cupcakes
with purple sprinkles
and Manda's mom
wrapped the leftovers
up for Hannah
to take home.
Hannah stayed
in her clothes
at bedtime
and Manda's mom
was all like,
where's your nightgown,
sweetheart?
And Hannah said,
I forgot it.
When the truth was,
she didn't own one
at all.
Well, I'm sure
Amanda has something
you can borrow.
Let's go see.
Then,
Manda's mom
was opening
all the drawers
in her dresser
and going through
the closet
and making
a whole pile
of stuff
that she said
was either
too small
for Manda
or that Manda
never wore anymore.
Not just nightgowns,
but jeans
and a dress
and shirts
and this pair
of pink cowboy boots
that Hannah tried on
and they fit perfect,
like her feet
and Manda's
were the same shape
and everything.
Take them,
Manda's mother said.
Take all these things.
Amanda doesn't wear
any of it anymore.
Amanda looked
kind of surprised,
a little angry,
maybe even.
So Hannah said,
No, thanks.
I'll just borrow
the nightgown
for tonight.
Manda's mom
gave Manda a look
and Manda smiled
at Hannah
and said,
No,
you should take
all this stuff.
I was just gonna give it
to the Salvation Army
anyway.
Hannah went to sleep
that night,
curled up against Manda,
wearing her white
nightgown,
Manda's heavy comforter
on top of them
and it was the happiest
she'd ever been.
I love you,
Manda,
she said.
Manda Panda,
she added,
giggling the new name
into Manda's shoulder.
Go to sleep,
Manda said.
She wore Manda's
pleated acid-washed jeans
and lavender polo shirt
with the collar turned up,
the way Manda always wore it,
to school when they all
came back from the break
the next Monday.
And Mel had laughed,
then got all angry
and asked,
Amanda,
isn't that your shirt
and your jeans?
And Manda turned
bright red
and Hannah said,
yeah,
they are.
I stole them
when I was at her house.
Mel glared at Manda.
When was dogface
at your house?
And Manda,
she looked all frantic,
little drops of sweat
dotting her forehead.
I broke in,
Hannah said quickly.
Broke in
when no one was home.
Thieving little bitch,
Mel said.
Give them back,
right now.
Yeah,
go take them off
or we'll do it for you,
Katie said.
She took a step
closer to Hannah,
like she was going
to start ripping them off
right in the hall.
It's okay,
really,
Manda had said.
They're like a hundred years old.
They don't even fit.
Just let her.
It is not
fucking okay,
Mel snarled.
Manda hadn't said
any more.
And Hannah had gone
into the bathroom
and taken off the clothes
and put on her gym clothes
and worn those
all day instead,
her stinky t-shirt
and two tight shorts.
She'd fold in Manda's
clothes up neatly
and return them to her
during study hall.
Manda slipped them
into her book bag
without saying anything,
but she smiled
apologetically at Hannah.
When Hannah got home
from school that day,
she put the rest
of the hand-me-downs
in a kitchen garbage bag,
sealed it tight,
and hid them
in the bottom
of the trash bin
in the garage.
One of her chores
was rolling the bin
to the curb
every Friday night,
so she knew
it'd be gone soon,
and her daddy
would never know.
But the boots,
those lovely pink boots,
she kept those.
She knew better
than to wear them
to school.
She put them on
every day
when she got home
and danced around
in her bedroom,
imagining she was Manda,
and she lived
in a big house
with a big closet
full of clothes
she never wore
and sweet pink cupcakes
baking in the kitchen.
The real Manda,
just outside
her bedroom window,
smiled at her now,
held out her hand,
Come on,
she said.
Come trick-or-treating
with us.
It'll be so much fun.
Promise.
I,
I don't even
have a costume.
It's cool.
We'll make you one,
Mel said.
We'll give you
parts of ours.
Then Mel reached up,
untied her beautiful
silver cape,
and held it out.
It sparkled
in the streetlights.
Katie will give you
her wig,
Mel said.
But the wig is,
Katie started to protest.
Then Mel shot her a glance.
The boa, too,
Mel ordered.
Katie took off
the wig and boa
without question
and held them out
to Hannah.
Hannah lifted up
the screen,
wiggled her way
out the window.
It was only
when she dropped
to the ground
that she realized
she was wearing
the pink boots,
Manda's boots.
But no one
said anything.
No one seemed
to notice,
not even Manda.
Oh,
Hannah,
they all said,
putting their hands
on her,
patting her back,
stroking her hair
like she was
something truly great,
like their own
pet unicorn.
We are going
to have so much fun.
It'll be a night
you won't ever forget.
2016.
Amanda stood looking
out the living room window,
watching Erin
and her friends
saunter off
down the street.
They moved
so easily together,
bumping against each other,
moving the same way,
the same direction,
like a school of fish.
She'd walked
that way once
with Mel and Katie,
like they were
one being,
a three-headed beast,
finishing each other's
sentences,
breaking into
journey songs,
Don't Stop Believin'
and
Who's Crying Now?
It was just
past six now,
already full dark.
Amanda went out
onto the porch,
plugged in
the plastic glowing witch,
the strings
of tiny orange lights
wrapped around
the porch railings.
Putting up the lights
had been Jim's job too,
but Amanda had gone out
and bravely gotten up
on a stepladder,
wrapping them around
the posts.
But no matter
how she tried,
she couldn't get them
to come out even.
Being honest,
looks like shit, Mom,
Erin had said
with a shrug,
and she'd been right.
Amanda didn't even
attempt to do
the fake cobwebs
and dangling plastic spiders
Jim usually decorated
the porch with.
He loved Halloween.
Amanda hated it.
She shivered now,
looked down the street
at a group of small ghosts
and witches
headed her way
with their parents.
Amanda went in,
readied herself
with the giant plastic bowl
of chocolate bars
and lollipops.
Jim had dressed up
every year,
answering the door
dressed as a zombie,
a vampire,
a mummy.
Always a monster,
always something
slightly frightening.
The trick-or-treaters
had loved it.
Erin had always
made a show
of running away from him
as he chased her
around the house,
arms outstretched,
reaching for her
as she screamed
in mock horror.
Amanda had hidden
in the back of the house,
claiming she had
so much work
to catch up on
or a migraine
coming on.
Trick-or-treat!
The little crew
gathered on her porch
now called.
She forced a smile,
opened the door.
Oh my goodness,
what do we have here?
She said,
holding out the bowl.
A ghost,
two witches,
and...
What are you, sweetie?
The girl in the back
stepped forward
into the light.
She looked about
five or six years old.
I'm a chicken,
she said,
showing off
her cardboard wings
with yellow feathers
glued on.
She wore a yellow shirt,
all splattered in red.
And what a fine chicken
you are,
Amanda said.
I'm a dead chicken,
the little girl
said delightedly.
See my blood?
Oh my,
Amanda said.
The woman with them,
too young to be a mother,
surely,
must be an older sister,
or a babysitter,
maybe.
Gave her an apologetic,
you know how kids are,
smile.
Amanda spotted another group
coming down the street.
Older children,
one of them wearing
a rainbow wig.
Happy Halloween,
she said,
closing the door
on the small children,
wanting to lock it.
She went back
into the kitchen,
opened a bottle of Merlot,
and poured herself
a full glass.
The uncarved pumpkin
sat on the island,
taunting.
She took a good swig of wine,
caught a glimpse
of her reflection
in the dark window
over the sink,
a frazzled-looking woman
in jeans
and a black turtleneck,
dark circles
under her eyes.
She took another
long sip of wine,
feeling it warming her
from the inside out,
and turned toward
the pumpkin.
She could do this,
and wouldn't Erin
be surprised
when she got home
and saw the soft glow
of a grinning jack-o-lantern
decorating their porch?
See,
your old mom's
not such a Halloween
party pooper
after all.
Amanda opened drawers
and cabinets,
pulled out a large
carving knife
and a small
paring knife,
a big metal spoon,
a plastic bowl
for the guts,
and a baking tray
for the seeds,
because that's another
thing Jim had always done,
roasted the seeds
after sprinkling them
with cinnamon and sugar.
Erin loved them that way.
These,
she'd say,
holding a handful of seeds,
are the epitome
of fall.
Then she'd give
a coy grin,
clearly pleased with herself
for showing off
her vocabulary.
There was a knock
on the door.
Amanda set her glass
of wine down,
picked up the bowl
of candy,
and opened the door.
Not one,
but two
Hannah beasts
greeted her,
blue faces
leering,
smiling,
rainbow wigs
glowing.
Trick or treat,
they said.
Amanda took
a step back.
There was a third girl,
wearing a white lab coat
and big black
framed eyeglasses
just behind them.
She said,
Dumbasses,
you're supposed
to say boo.
That's what the real
Hannah beast said.
Amanda's breath
caught in her throat.
Say boo.
Say boo,
Hannah.
1982.
Say boo,
Hannah.
Mel instructed
as they stood
on their first porch,
holding open
their bags.
Hannah's face
itched
and felt tight
from the blue makeup
they'd put on,
left over from
Katie's clown kit.
She'd used up
all the white and red
on her own face,
and blue
was the only color
she had left.
So they coated
Hannah's face in it.
At first,
it had been greasy,
sticky,
as they rubbed it on.
Now,
as it dried,
it itched.
The old man
passing out candy
stared at her,
taking in her
rainbow clown wig,
feather boa,
and silver cape.
He asked,
And what are you
supposed to be?
She's a Hannah beast,
Mel crowed.
Say boo,
Hannah.
Say boo
and show the man
how scary you can be.
Boo,
Hannah said quietly.
The man shook his head.
Laughed.
The girls laughed too.
Hannah stood up taller,
rocked back on her heels,
and lunged forward
like a snake
about to strike.
Boo!
She screamed.
The old man jumped,
startled,
and he frowned,
muttered,
Crazy kid,
and closed the door
in their faces.
The girls squealed,
squealed with joy,
patted her on the back.
Nice job,
Hannah beast.
Holy shit,
did you see his face?
Hannah beast is scary.
Hannah beast is crazy.
Hannah beast is spectacular.
They ran down the sidewalk,
laughing.
All the other groups
of trick-or-treaters,
all the adults on porches,
turned to look their way.
The soles of Hannah's pink boots
clapped as loud
as a horse's hooves
along the sidewalk.
The boots look good on you,
Mando whispered in her ear,
her breath sweet with sugar.
They ran through the center of town,
past the park
where the Halloween party
for the little kids
had been earlier,
the park where tiny ghosts
and goblins and princesses
had bobbed for apples,
played pin the arm
on the skeleton,
and attacked a ghost piñata
strung up with heavy rope
from a beam in the center
of the white gazebo.
They ran and ran
until Mel stopped them
at a house
with a porch decorated
with Halloween lights,
several happy jack-o'-lanterns,
and a patchwork scarecrow
slumped in a chair.
They all crowded together
on the tiny front porch
with sloping floorboards,
shoulder to shoulder,
and it felt good.
So good to be bumping
against these girls,
laughing with them
under the Halloween wind chimes
hung above the front door,
little ghosts dancing,
banging into each other,
making music.
They were like those ghosts,
Hannah thought,
smiling up at them.
They knocked too loud
on the door,
sang out,
Trick or treat,
trick or treat,
and a woman answered,
held out a bowl of candy,
and said,
Happy Halloween.
A poodle danced
around the lady's feet,
barking in that
little yappy dog
kind of way,
a pink collar
with fake diamonds
glittering around its neck.
And the girls
didn't have to tell Hannah
this time.
She did it
without being asked.
She pressed forward,
stood on her tiptoes
to make herself taller.
She held up her arms,
cape flapping behind her,
got right in this lady's face,
and screamed,
Boo!
which made the poor lady
recoil
and scream a little.
And once she caught her breath,
she asked,
What is wrong with you?
The girls all laughed,
loud,
shrieking laughs.
She's Hannah Beast,
Mel said,
giggling.
That's what's wrong.
She can't help it,
Katie said.
She's crazy.
I'd bring your puppy
inside if I was you.
She might just eat it up.
And Hannah
bared her teeth
and growled.
The lady
pulled her dog inside,
slammed the door
in their faces.
The girls all laughed,
loud and shrieking laughs.
You're the real thing,
Hannah Beast,
Katie said,
twirling around her
like Hannah was the sun,
and she was just
a little planet
trying to get warm.
I am spectacular,
Hannah crowed to the night
as she flew down the steps,
the others following her now,
chasing her,
calling after her.
Come back,
slow down,
don't leave us.
We love you,
Hannah Beast.
2016.
Amanda cut the top
off the pumpkin
in six quick slashes,
lifted it off,
a neat little cap
with a curved stem.
She went to work
hollowing the thing out.
She hated the cold,
squishy feel
of the pumpkin's insides,
the guts,
as Erin called them.
She thought of that
long ago Halloween,
the week before,
actually,
when Mel had presented
her carefully laid out plan.
I think it's
totally brilliant,
but
are you sure
it'll work?
Katie asked.
Of course,
I'm sure.
She'll come with us.
She'll do what we say.
But don't you think
it's kind of...
Amanda hesitated.
Kind of what?
Mel snapped,
eyes daring Amanda
to continue.
I don't know.
Amanda bit her lip.
Think of all the trouble
she's going to get in.
Mel looked at her,
head cocked.
So?
Come on, Amanda.
It's not like
she doesn't deserve it.
Think about it.
Always pestering us
all the time,
being so fucking weird.
And don't forget
the bitch broke
into your house
and stole your old clothes,
Katie added.
She's probably like
all obsessed with you
or something gross.
Plus,
it will be hilarious
and you know it.
Amanda frowned.
What if she tells?
Amanda asked.
Mel laughed.
As if anyone
would believe her.
As if?
Katie repeated,
trying to copy
Mel's laugh.
Mel smiled.
It's the perfect plan.
Now,
Amanda topped off her wine,
told herself to stop it.
Stop thinking about that night.
Stop reliving every moment,
every terrible decision
she'd made.
Stop playing the
if-only game.
She trained herself well
over the years.
If you spend enough time
blocking something out,
build sturdy enough
walls around it.
And it's almost like
it didn't happen.
Except on Halloween.
One night each year,
it all came back
when the parade of Hannah's
showed up at her door,
when the life-size rag doll
dressed as Hannah Beast
was cut down
from the gazebo
in the center of town,
a noose around its neck.
Say boo, Hannah.
Now she picked up the knife
and started on the eyes
of the jack-o'-lantern.
Round eyes,
she decided.
Jim had always done
scary, slit eyes
with dramatic,
angry, arched eyebrows.
A frowning mouth
full of jagged,
dangerous teeth.
Her pumpkin
was going to be happy.
Cheerful.
She was finishing up
the second eye
when there was a knock
at the door.
Another round
of trick-or-treaters.
Supergirl,
a soldier,
two zombies,
and one Hannah Beast
who made sure
to say boo.
Amanda gritted her teeth
and held out the bowl.
She'd just started
on the nose
when there was another knock.
A Hannah Beast
and a vampire.
Trick-or-treat.
Boo.
This Hannah Beast
was collecting candy
in a red plastic gas can
with a hole
cut in the top.
Too goddamned
much.
Amanda stared
at the gas can
full of bright
candy wrappers.
Thought of saying something,
something adult,
like,
you've taken this
too far,
or,
don't you think
that's in poor taste?
But before she got
the chance,
the girl was gone.
Before she even
got to close the door,
another group
was coming up the walkway
toward the porch.
Jesus.
Why so many
Hannah Beasts
this year?
It had to be a record.
This time,
it was a boy
dressed as a Hannah Beast.
He was accompanied
by a girl
who looked to be dressed
as a prostitute
and another boy
in a long black trench coat
and a ski mask.
This Hannah Beast
had visible stubble
on his chin
under the thin blue makeup.
Boo.
He said,
voice bullfrog deep.
Fuck you.
Amanda said back
to him in her head.
She kept her lips
tightly pursed
so the words
wouldn't find their way out
and thrust the bowl
of candy
in the boy's direction.
He took a whole handful,
then was gone,
the others trailing
behind him.
Come back.
Slow down.
Don't leave us.
We love you,
Hannah Beast.
You're only supposed
to take one,
Amanda shouted at him.
He gave her the finger
behind his back,
not even bothering
to look at her.
Amanda closed the door,
refilled her wine.
The bottle was almost empty now
and went back
to the pumpkin.
She was further along with it
than she'd realized.
The nose was done
and had a delicate
triangle shape.
Now for the mouth.
A happy pumpkin
needed a big grin.
Some chunky teeth,
maybe.
Cheerful,
but not too goofy.
She picked up
the paring knife
and started
at the left corner
of the mouth,
working her way down,
doing a light line
at first,
just breaking the skin
to get the design
roughed out,
then going in deeper.
The pumpkin
was soon smiling
back at her.
Hello, you,
she said to it,
thinking,
won't Aaron be pleased?
Job well done,
mom.
A shadow
passed in front
of the kitchen window.
Amanda glanced up,
just in time
to see a figure
moving by
the living room window.
Someone in a cape
with a black eye mask
and a rainbow wig.
Fuck!
Amanda jumped back
off the kitchen stool,
the knife slipping.
She'd cut herself
at the base of the thumb.
There was blood
on the mouth
of the pumpkin,
covering its lower teeth.
Fuck!
Fuck!
Fuck!
There was a knock
at the door.
Trick or treat!
Voices called.
Amanda wrapped
a kitchen towel
around her hand,
went to the door.
A Hannah beast
and a slutty devil.
You're not supposed
to cross the yard,
she scolded.
You're supposed
to stay on the walkway.
Um,
we did,
said the girl devil.
You crossed the yard?
I saw you
from the kitchen.
It wasn't us,
the devil said
with a shrug.
Boo?
The Hannah beast
behind her said,
cautiously.
Fuck off,
said Amanda,
slamming the door
in their faces,
looking down
to see the blood
had soaked
through the towel.
1982.
They went
from house
to house
until her pillowcase
was heavy,
heavy like she really
did have a dead dog
inside it,
which was what the girls
were telling everyone
they met.
Hannah beast's a real monster,
that's for sure.
Be careful,
or she'll eat you up.
She's got a dead poodle
inside her bag.
She's gonna snack
on it later.
Yum,
yum,
yum.
You're doing so good,
Hannah.
We love you,
Hannah.
You're scaring the shit
out of the whole town,
Hannah.
This is your night,
the night of Hannah beast.
Say boo.
Boo,
boo,
boo.
They flew
through the town.
Manda was holding
her hand as they ran,
and Hannah's heartbeat
pounded in her ears.
Her face felt tight,
her head itched
under the rainbow wig,
but she was happy,
so happy.
The feathers of the boa
tickling her
as she ran,
the cape flying
out behind her,
everyone in town,
all the kids
from school,
they all saw her.
They saw her
with the other girls,
and they knew.
They knew
she was something special.
But now,
it was late,
nearly ten.
The streets were clear
of trick-or-treaters.
Porch lights
had been turned off.
They sat on the wooden floor
of the gazebo
in the park,
eating candy,
trading favorites.
Amanda didn't like
anything with nuts.
Mel hated
mounds bars,
which meant Katie
did too.
They gave Hannah
all their peanut butter cups,
didn't even make her
trade for them.
I should go home,
Hannah said,
even though she knew
Daddy would be sleeping
his bourbon sleep
until the alarm went off
at seven tomorrow.
No way,
not yet,
Katie said,
grabbing her arm.
We've got one more
special surprise,
Hannah,
Mel said.
What's that?
It's a scavenger hunt,
Katie explained.
Do you know what that is?
Amanda asked.
Sure,
I guess,
said Hannah,
thinking it sounded like
a thing from birthday parties,
even though she hadn't
been invited to a birthday party
since second grade.
It's where you follow clues,
gather objects,
and find a prize.
Like a treasure hunt?
She asked.
Yeah,
like a treasure hunt,
Katie said,
smiling,
bobbing her head.
Well,
what's the prize?
Mel laughed.
Think about the word
prize,
Hannah.
It's short for
surprise,
right?
And it wouldn't be a surprise
if we told you.
It's gonna be good,
Hannah,
Katie promised.
Something you'll
never forget.
Are you ready?
Mel asked.
Ready for the first clue?
I don't know,
Hannah said.
It's late,
and my dad,
if you don't wanna do it,
you don't have to,
Manda said.
Of course she wants to do it,
Mel said,
giving Manda a disgusted look.
Yeah,
Katie said.
You want the surprise,
don't you,
Hannah?
Hannah hefted her sack,
heavy with candy,
over shoulder.
Boo!
She howled at the top
of her lungs,
and the girls all laughed
and patted her on the back,
and she was the star
of the show.
It was the night
of Hannah Beast.
Hannah Beast unleashed,
that's what Mel said.
You can leave your candy
with me,
Manda said.
It'll be easier
without it,
and I'll keep it safe,
I promise.
Mel handed her
a piece of paper,
and Hannah squinted down
at it through the eye
holes of her mask.
You'll find me
in old man Jarvis's garage.
I'm made of metal,
I ring,
but I'm not a phone.
Hannah looked up
from the paper
to the others.
What are you waiting for?
Mel asked.
Go!
Hannah started off
running toward
old man Jarvis's place.
She looked back
and saw the girls
standing in the gazebo,
watching her.
Aren't you coming?
She called.
We'll meet you
at the end.
But how will I know
what to do?
Just follow the clues,
Katie said.
You can do it!
Yeah,
you can do anything,
shouted Mel.
You're Hannah Beast!
2016.
Amanda wrapped her hand
in gauze and surgical tape.
The bleeding
had finally stopped.
Fucking idiot.
She mumbled to herself.
She went back out
to the kitchen,
poured the last swallows
of wine into her glass.
She lit the votive
and dropped it
inside the pumpkin,
stepped back
to admire her handiwork.
The smiling face
leered back at her,
round eyes hopeful,
expectant,
a slack-jawed grin
giving the thing
a bewildered look.
Her stomach twisted,
the wine turning to acid.
Hannah.
It was Hannah's face.
Hello,
Amanda Panda.
Long time no see.
The air seemed
to go out of her.
The cut on the base
of her thumb
throbbed in time
with her heartbeat.
At that moment,
the power went out,
plunging the house
into darkness
and silence.
The wine glass
slipped out of her hand,
crashing onto
the tile floor.
1982.
I ring,
but I'm not a phone.
Hannah worked the clue
around in her brain
as she entered
Mr. Jarvis' garage
through the open door.
She squinted
in the darkness
as she walked around
the old Plymouth
parked there.
There were tools
hanging on the wall,
rakes and hoes
and shovels,
and a workbench
at the end.
She walked over to it.
I ring,
ring around the rosy.
She looked at the tools
on the bench
and the wall,
hammer,
saws,
screwdrivers,
wrenches.
None of you ring,
she said.
She bit her lip.
She could do this.
She had to do this.
Show them
that she wasn't a dummy.
Not like everyone
thought she was.
I'm Hannah Beast,
she whispered.
I can do anything.
Then,
like a miracle,
the power of Hannah Beast
brought miracles.
She saw it.
There on the shelf
above
was what she'd
come for.
An old brass cowbell.
It was sitting
on top of a crowbar.
She picked up the bell,
saw it had a note
tied to it.
She moved closer
to the window
and read the note
by the light
coming in from
Mr. Jarvis' front porch.
Ring me
for one
full minute.
No cheating.
Then take the crowbar
underneath
and go to the Blakeleys.
Use the crowbar
to pry open
the door
to the shed.
Inside,
look for something red.
Bring this note
with you.
Hannah stuck the note
in her pocket,
held on to the bell,
and started ringing it
and counting.
One,
two,
three.
She was at 55
when the front door
to the Jarvis' house
banged open
and Mr. Jarvis
came walking
stiffly toward
the garage
calling,
Who's there?
What the hell
is going on?
She started
counting faster.
55,
56,
57,
58,
59,
60.
She dropped the bell,
grabbed the crowbar,
and tore out
of the garage,
nearly running into
Mr. Jarvis
in the driveway.
Hey,
come back here.
He yelled.
But she did not slow,
did not turn.
She zigzagged her way
through backyards,
across the Caldwell's field,
and over to the Blakeleys.
The old wooden shed
was in their backyard,
along a split rail fence.
She tugged on the door handle,
but it was locked,
as the note had said.
So she slid the chiseled end
of the crowbar
between the door and frame,
pushing it in
as far as it would go.
Then she pulled
her full weight
behind it.
The old wood
on the door frame
cracked and splintered,
and the door flew open.
She laughed.
She was Hannah Beast.
No locks could stop her.
The red thing
was waiting for her
right in the middle
of the shed.
An old gas can
with a note
tied around the handle.
Use the crowbar
to smash out
the window of the shed,
then leave it behind.
Take the gas can
to the Caldwell's old barn.
Look for something
small and brass.
Keep all the notes
with you.
Without pausing to think,
she smashed out
the old single pane windows
with the crowbar,
then threw it
to the ground.
As she sprinted
across the yard,
lights came on
in the window.
A man shouted,
Stop right there!
But she didn't
even turn around,
just ran faster,
harder,
the wig bobbing around
on the top of her head,
the cape flying out
behind her.
Boo!
She screamed
as loud as she could.
2016.
What the fuck?
Amanda said,
blinking in the darkness.
All the background
noises of life
were gone.
The humming refrigerator,
the ice maker,
the furnace clicking on,
and fans starting.
She tried to remember
where the breaker box
was in the basement.
What you were even
supposed to do
to try to get
the power back on?
Flip a switch?
Change a fuse?
This had always been
Jim's department,
and she stumbled
forward,
stepping over the
broken glass
and spilled wine
toward the window,
saw it wasn't just
her house that was out.
It was the whole street,
the whole town,
maybe.
She didn't see
a hint of light
anywhere.
Amanda held still,
watching,
listening.
A siren
whined far off.
The girl screamed.
Someone laughed.
Amanda thought
she smelled smoke.
Her throat
grew tight.
The grinning jack-o-lantern
with the candle
sputtering inside
was now the only light
in the room,
filling the kitchen
with a fiery
orange glow.
The flickering eyes
were watching,
following her,
saying,
I know who you are.
I know what you've done.
I'm sorry,
she said out loud,
the words tumbling out
before she could stop them.
I didn't know
what would happen.
I should have stopped it,
but I had no idea.
None of us did.
I was young
and scared
and stupid.
Tears
filled her eyes.
Her throat
grew tight
as she tried
to keep down
the sob
she felt coming.
I'm sorry,
she said again.
Sorry for being
such a fucking coward.
The pumpkin only stared,
the hideous grin
seeming to grow wider,
more taunting.
She was not going
to be forgiven.
Not this easily.
1982.
Running.
Running.
Wind in her blue face,
blowing the cape back.
And the hair.
Oh, the hair.
The great rainbow
happy clown wig.
She's a wild thing.
Hannah Beast unleashed.
The gas can
bumped against her thigh,
the gas in it
sloshing around
like water
in an empty belly.
Her brain
buzzed from sugar,
from the high
being around
those girls
had given her.
And now?
Now she was
on a hunt,
a scavenger hunt,
and she was going
to get a prize,
a surprise,
something good,
something wonderful,
something that would
make the girls
love her even more.
Love her more,
more,
more.
Her heart
pounded as she ran,
felt like it was
going to explode
right out of her chest.
The barn was in sight,
a big old
leaning thing.
Miracle it was
still standing.
The Caldwells
were sleeping,
tucked safe
in their beds,
the lights in the
white farmhouse
all turned off,
too late
for trick-or-treaters.
Mr. and Mrs. Caldwell
had two kids,
little kids,
still in elementary
school,
fourth and fifth grade,
lucky little buggers.
Elementary school
wasn't like middle school,
where the halls
were long and dark,
and people jumped
out at you,
shoved you,
kicked you,
people left
horrible stuff
in your locker,
dog shit
in paper bags,
notes that said,
why don't you
just curl up
and die,
Hannah?
She entered the barn,
ducked into the shadows,
pausing to catch her breath,
trying to slow
her racing heart.
The barn was open
at one end
and had a hayloft
with a wooden ladder
leading up to it,
and it was still
full of old hay bales
from back when there
used to be cows
and horses.
There was a long
row of windows,
most with the glass
busted out.
The floor was dirt.
There was a broken tractor,
an old motorcycle,
engine parts,
kids' bicycles.
The barn smelled
like old wood,
grease,
and gasoline.
something brass.
How was she going
to find something
brass in here?
Needle in a haystack?
But they'd made it
easy for her.
So easy.
Too easy?
Did they think
she was that dumb?
Or were they
just being nice?
Nice, nice.
Nice as spice.
Manda Panda,
maybe,
but not the others.
Maybe Manda
had left this for her,
right where she
could find it.
Manda
was on her side.
Manda wanted her
to win,
to get the big
surprise of a prize.
At the other end
of the barn,
there was a dim glow.
A flashlight
turned on,
left on the floor.
And there,
in the beam
of the flashlight,
was an old
brass lighter
with a note
tucked underneath.
She picked up
the lighter,
opened it up,
and flicked it
to see if it worked.
The wheel
struck the flint,
and a flame
came to life.
Hannah knew
how to work lighters.
She sometimes
lit Daddy's cigarettes
for him
while he was driving.
Light me up,
Hannah Banana,
he'd say.
She'd pull a camel
out of his pack
and get it going
for him.
Take a few puffs
herself first,
just as it made
Daddy smile.
She picked up
the note.
You're almost done.
Take the three notes
and burn them
with the lighter.
Leave the ashes
in the barn.
Take the lighter
and gas can
and bring them
to the tallest oak tree
at the edge
of the yard.
We'll meet you there
and give you
your prize.
Hannah scrabbled
the notes
out of her pocket,
held them
with this final one,
and flicked
the lighter.
Watched the flames
swallow them up.
She held them
until her fingers
were hot
and she couldn't
stand it any longer.
Then she dropped them,
watched what was
left of the pages
sink
and flutter
to the floor
like burning moths.
Once they were down there
and had burned out,
she stomped on them
to make sure.
Didn't want to leave
anything smoldering,
not in this old barn.
The wind blew hard
outside,
rattling the glass
left in the windows.
She thought she heard
something up above her,
coming from the hayloft,
a board,
creaking like a sigh.
She pocketed the lighter,
picked up the gas can,
and headed out,
scanning the tree line,
looking for the tallest oak.
She didn't know her trees,
didn't know an oak
from a maple
from an ash,
especially now that
most of them
had their leaves off.
She headed for
the tallest tree
she could see,
walking across
the big yard,
through grass
that needed to be cut,
so long it was
like a hayfield.
She got to the tree
and looked around
for the girls.
Nothing.
Manda?
She called,
keeping her voice low,
not wanting to wake up
the Caldwells.
Mel?
Katie?
She was there
before them.
She'd been faster
than they thought
she'd be.
Wouldn't they be
impressed?
Hannah Beast
was fast.
Hannah Beast
was clever.
She stood next
to the tree,
fidgeting with the lighter.
It made her fingers
smell tangy
and metallic,
like raw metal.
She flicked it,
watched the flame.
They'd see her now
as they came,
see her
and know she had
the lighter.
She was like
the Statue of Liberty
with her torch.
She held it up high,
her eyes on the flame.
I got it.
I found it.
I win.
The acrid,
lighter fluid smell
filled her nostrils.
But there was
something else.
Another smell
behind it.
A campfire smell.
Smoke.
She smelled smoke.
She looked over
at the barn
and saw flames
curling out
through the windows,
reaching up
like long fingers
all the way
to the roof.
Her heart
jackhammered
in her chest.
Had she done this?
Had the paper
not been out?
No,
it had been.
She'd made sure.
She looked over
at the barn
and saw flames
curling out
through the windows,
reaching up
like long fingers
all the way
to the roof.
She stood,
frozen.
She thought of running,
but then the girls
would never find her.
So she stood
and watched
from her safe place
tucked behind
the thick old tree.
The lights
from the house
came on
and Mrs. Caldwell
came out,
screaming.
She tried to run
into the burning barn,
but Mr. Caldwell
was running now too,
grabbed her from behind,
stopped her.
There was another
sound too,
screaming,
high-pitched
and hysterical
from inside the barn.
Animals,
Hannah thought
at first.
There must have been
animals in there
after all.
A horse
or a cow?
A couple of pigs
maybe tucked away
in a dark corner.
Ben!
Brian!
Mrs. Caldwell
called.
She fought
against Mr. Caldwell,
kicking,
digging her nails
into his arms.
Let me go!
For God's sake,
Margaret!
He said,
you can't go in there!
Brian!
Ben!
She howled.
The langs
came over
from across the street.
The barn
was completely
engulfed
in flames now.
It seemed
to have taken
only a minute.
Mrs. Caldwell
was screaming,
sobbing,
hysterical.
And Mr. Caldwell
kept his arms
wrapped tight
around her.
More people came.
People from
down the street.
Sirens
started in the distance.
Too late now.
The VFD boys
with their pumper trucks
and miles of hose
could never save
that old barn.
Hannah watched
from behind the tree,
feeling like she was
watching some show
on TV,
not something
from her very own life.
The barn roof
caved in
with a terrible
cracking,
roaring sound.
And Mrs. Caldwell
sank to her knees,
howling
like she was
the one on fire.
Then Hannah
saw the girls,
her girls,
coming down the street,
twittering
and bobbing
like a flock
of birds.
They slowed,
all three staring
at the burning barn.
Amanda grabbed
Mel's shoulder,
leaned in,
said something
Hannah couldn't hear.
Then they all ran
to the sidewalk
in front of the barn,
to the group
of neighbors
gathered there.
Hannah stepped out
from behind the tree,
waving,
trying to get
the girls' attention,
not sure if she
should run to them
or wait
right where she was.
That was what
the note said,
to wait.
So that's probably
what she was
supposed to do?
Mr. Jarvis
was there
in the circle
of men
the girls
were talking
to?
The fire
was so loud
she could make
out only snippets.
I saw her,
she heard Mr. Jarvis
say.
Mr. Blakely
was there.
She heard,
gasoline.
A lady in a
fluffy turquoise
bathrobe,
it might have been
Mrs. Novak,
spoke to the
girls grimly.
Hannah heard
every word
this time.
Benjamin and
Brian were
sleeping in the
hayloft.
They do it
every Halloween.
Hannah looked
back at the fire,
showers of sparks
going up
and up
and away.
It was like
hell,
like what she'd
imagined hell
might be like,
that hot,
that smoky,
that loud.
Then Mel
turned toward
Hannah's hiding
place by the
tree,
pointed.
Her eyes
blazed with
the reflection
of the fire,
devil eyes.
There she is,
she shouted.
She did this.
Everyone
looked her way,
saw the gas
can by her feet,
the lighter
in her hand.
Katie
stared,
stunned,
slack-jawed.
But slowly,
she reached up
her hand
and pointed
to some
of the men.
They took a step
in Hannah's
direction.
Hannah looked
right at
Amanda,
her eyes
pleading.
Please,
say something.
Don't let them
do this to me.
Amanda was
crying now,
crying hard.
But she,
she began,
and Mel
clamped a hand
down on
Amanda's shoulder,
held tight
with a claw-like
grip that
would surely
leave a bruise.
Amanda looked
down at the
ground,
then back
to Hannah.
Yes,
that's her,
she said
through her tears.
That's
Hannah,
beast.
And Hannah,
she turned
and ran.
2016.
It had been
Mel
who'd set
the fire.
Amanda should
have stopped
her.
She should
have done
something,
actually fucking
stood up to her
for once.
Now,
as an adult,
she couldn't
believe how much
power Mel
had had over
her.
What had she
been so afraid
of?
Being shunned
from the lunch
table?
Having nasty
notes left
in her locker?
It all
seemed so
trivial,
compared to
what had
happened to
those Caldwell
boys,
what had
happened to
Hannah.
Over the
years,
Amanda had
told herself
that she
didn't think
Mel would
really do
it,
that she'd
been sure
it was just
another of
Mel's grand
schemes that
would come
to nothing.
Like the way
she said one
day they'd
go to the
mall and
hide in
the bathroom
with their
feet up
during closing
time.
Then they'd
sneak back
out and
have the
whole mall
to themselves.
And they'd
get skateboards
from the
sporting goods
store and
go up and
down the
mall,
eating all
the candy
they wanted
from the
sweet spot,
then play
Mrs. Pac-Man
all night
at the
arcade.
Mel would
go on
and on
about
everything
they'd
do that
night at
the mall.
But Amanda
knew it
would never
happen.
Amanda
had told
herself
the barn
fire would
be like
that.
So when
Mel came
sprinting out
of the
barn,
grinning
wildly,
saying she'd
done it,
Amanda was
sure she was
just fooling
around.
Until she
saw the
smoke.
She could
have run
in then,
tried to
put it
out,
or gone
and pounded
on the
Caldwell's
door and
told them
to call
the fire
department
quick.
She could
have done
something.
Instead,
she saw
the smoke,
the orange
glow of fire
from deep
inside the
barn,
and she
ran like
the coward
she was,
the coward
she would
always be.
She took
off right
behind Mel
and Katie.
They were
laughing,
giddy.
And hadn't
Amanda laughed
too?
Sure she
had.
It was
terrible,
but it was
also exciting
and crazy,
like nothing
she'd ever
done.
Thrilling.
They'd had
no idea the
Caldwell boys
were sleeping
up in the
hayloft,
the plan
was to
make people
think Hannah
had burned
down the
barn,
get her
in a little
trouble,
not have
the whole
town think
she was
a murderer,
not to
be
murderers
themselves.
The
pumpkin
watched,
smiling
stupidly
at her,
looking more
like Hannah
than ever.
I love
you,
Amanda
Panda.
Amanda
remembered
feeling Hannah's
warm breath
on her neck
the night
she'd
slept over.
snuggled up
against Amanda
in her twin
bed.
Go to sleep,
Amanda had
said that
night,
irritated that
Hannah was
there,
that she was
so pathetic
and desperate,
but also a
little thrilled
by the power
she had over
this girl,
this girl who
loved her so
completely,
who called her
Amanda Panda,
which was
incredibly stupid,
but kinda sweet.
Amanda had
hated it
and loved it
all at the
same time,
which was the
way she'd
felt about
Hannah,
wasn't it?
Amanda
wondered for
a moment
if Katie
or Mel
ever thought
about that
night,
about Hannah,
about those
boys in the
barn.
She hadn't
spoken to
either in
years,
couldn't even
bear to keep
up with them
on social
media.
No,
she thought.
Neither of
them ever
understood the
enormity of
what they had
done.
Neither of
them could.
The candle
flickered,
making the
pumpkin seem
to open his
eyes wider,
looking frightened,
desperate.
Please,
Amanda,
don't let them
do this to me.
Enough already,
Amanda said,
picking up the
carving knife,
digging it into
the pumpkin's
left eye,
determined to
change its
shape,
to make it
look less
Hannah-like.
In the
darkness and
silence,
she worked to
make the eyes
more triangular,
angrier,
more like one
of Jim's
devil-faced
pumpkins.
When she
finished with
the eyes,
she stepped
back.
It was no
good.
It just looked
like a furious
version of
Hannah leering
back at her.
You can't
make me go
away this
time,
she picked
up the
knife again,
thinking she'd
fix it,
change the
nose and
mouth,
banish
Hannah-beast
once and
for all.
She froze.
Sure,
she'd heard a
giggle from
somewhere behind
her,
deep in the
dark center
of the house.
She listened
hard,
and it was
not laughter
she heard this
time,
but the clip-clap
sound of boot
heels moving
across the floor,
the sound of her
old pink cowboy
boots,
the boots her
mother had
shamed her
into giving
to Hannah.
The boots
Hannah had
been wearing
that night.
The boots
look good
on you,
Hannah.
Hello?
She called.
She waited,
knife clutched
in her hand,
heart pounding
in her ears.
Hannah?
She asked,
choking out
the name.
The jack-o'-lantern
grinned,
seemed to give
her an evil
wink.
I'm right
here.
I have been
all along.
1982.
Sometimes the
best place to
hide was right
in plain sight.
She sat,
cross-legged
in the dark
gazebo,
right in the
middle of town,
the same spot
where she'd been
just hours before,
trading candy
with the girls,
taking all their
peanut butter cups.
The floor of the
gazebo was littered
with the wrappers
they'd left behind.
She sat for so
long,
her legs turned
to pins and
needles.
The sirens
went on
and on.
It seemed
everyone in town
was up and awake,
walking the streets,
talking.
They talked
over each other,
shouted across
the street
to friends
and neighbors.
Did you hear?
Did you hear?
Bad fire
at the Caldwells
place.
Both their
boys are dead.
They were
sleeping in the
barn.
It was that
Hannah Talbot
girl.
She came
to my house
tonight,
dressed all
crazy,
acting like
some kind
of animal,
threatened my
dog,
screamed right
in my face.
Mental,
that one is.
What was
that crazy
costume she
was wearing
anyway?
Said she
was some
kind of
beast.
She was
all over
town,
wicked girl
running wild,
broke into
the Jarvis's
garage,
stole a
crowbar,
used it to
get a gas
can from
the Blakely
shed,
busted up
the shed
while she
was at
it.
Then she
walked right
on over
to the
Caldwells
place,
soaked
that old
barn in
gasoline,
torched it.
Those poor
boys never
had a chance.
She
could tell,
of course,
she could
tell,
but who
was going
to believe
her?
Who ever
believed a
girl like
Hannah,
a girl
who'd been
caught with
a gas
can and
a lighter?
That's
her,
Amanda
had said.
That's
Hannah
Beast.
She was
still in
her costume,
now dirty,
stinking of
smoke and
gasoline.
Girls
like that,
they're
going
straight
to hell.
You
stay
away
from
them
unless
you
want
to
get
burned.
Her
face
itched,
didn't
feel like
her face
at all.
The wig
was on
crooked,
the cape
was torn.
She
looked up,
saw a
rope
dangling
down,
an old
piece of
clothesline
maybe,
looped
around the
overhead
beam.
The rope
that had
held the
ghost
pinata
earlier.
The little
kids had
swung at
it with
a stick,
the ghost
bobbing,
dancing in
circles until
it was hit
dead on,
torn open,
candy flying
out,
the little
kids all
pushing each
other,
scrambling to
collect the
most pieces.
Hannah stood,
reaching for
the rope,
hands shaking
a little.
She gave
it a tug,
like she
was ringing
an invisible
bell.
I ring,
but I'm
not a
phone.
The rope
was looped
over one
of the
rafters,
tied tight
with a
string of
knots.
She gripped
it with
both hands
and swung,
feet drifting
over the
refuse of
the evening,
the clear
cellophane
of Manda's
Smarties,
the bright
scraps from
Mel's
Tootsie Pops,
the wrappers
from all
those Hershey
bars Katie
had eaten.
She was
her own
pinata,
swinging.
The rope
held her
weight.
She climbed
up on
the low
wall of
the gazebo,
cape flapping
in the breeze
like she
really was
some kind
of superhero
about to
take flight.
The cowboy
boots were
slippery,
and she
had to lean
quite a bit
to reach
the center,
but she
kept her
balance.
She made
a careful
slipknot in
the rope.
Her hands
didn't feel
like her
hands at
all.
It was like
it was some
other girl,
like she
was watching
some other
version of
herself in
some far-off
place tie
the knot.
The ghost
of a girl,
a beast
of a girl.
Hannah
Beast
unleashed.
The real
Hannah was
home,
tucked up all
safe and warm
in her bed
like a good
girl,
right where
she belonged,
a girl who
wasn't going
to hell,
a girl who
had a best
friend named
Amanda,
who'd given
her a pair
of special
pink boots,
boots that
fit so
perfectly,
it was like
she and
Amanda were
one.
The candy
wrappers got
caught in
the breeze,
skittered across
the floor
below her,
empty and
forgotten.
Hannah
looped the
rope around
her neck,
over the
rainbow wig,
over the
pink boa.
She heard
the girl's
voices in
her head as
she jumped
off the
wall.
Hannah
Beast
takes
flight,
swinging,
flying,
legs dangling
over the
floor.
Say
boo.
2016
Amanda
held her
breath,
listening to
the footsteps
come up
behind her.
They were
real.
She was
sure of
it.
Not born
of paranoia
and too
much wine,
right?
She glanced
down at the
pumpkin,
her knife
now turning
the blocky
teeth into
pointed ones,
giving it
a vampire
grin.
Hannah
be a
real
monster,
that's
for sure.
Be
careful.
Or
she'll
eat
you
up.
Amanda
looked
up,
out
across
the
kitchen
at
the
window
over
the
sink,
and
saw
the
reflection
in
it.
The
dim
kitchen,
lit
only
by
the
candle
in
the
jack-o-lantern,
herself,
hunched
over before
it,
whittling
away,
and a
figure
behind
her,
a girl
with a
blue
face,
a bright
clown
wig,
a pink
feather
boa,
a silver
cape.
She blinked,
but it did not go away,
just came closer,
closer still.
I love you,
Amanda Panda.
She could hear
the creature
breathing as it
drew near,
could smell
smoke
and gasoline.
Amanda
could not
move,
could not
speak
or scream.
She was
twelve years
old again,
looking at
Hannah as she
stood with the
gas can by
her feet,
the lighter
in her hand,
staring
desperately
at Amanda.
Please,
please don't
let them
do this
to me.
But
Amanda
had only
pointed.
That's
her.
That's
Hannah
Beast.
Bill!
Hannah roared
in her ear,
right behind
her now.
Go away!
Amanda
screamed as
she spun.
They were the
words she and
the other girls
had said so
many times
to Hannah
when she
followed them
around like
some pathetic
dog at
school,
when she
sat down
at their
lunch table,
when she
showed up
at Amanda's
house,
wanting to
ride bikes,
wanting to
sleep over
again.
Why can't
you just
go away?
Amanda
plunged her
carving knife
deep into
Hannah Beast's
belly,
shouting,
go the
fuck away!
But the
creature did
not disappear
like smoke,
like the
ghost she
should have
been.
Amanda's
hands were
warm and
sticky with
blood.
Hannah Beast
looked down
at the
knife in
her belly,
slack-jawed,
stupid.
When she
looked up,
Amanda saw
her,
really saw
her,
and in that
moment she
realized Hannah
had won.
No!
Amanda
cried,
the word
a wailing
sob.
No,
no,
no!
Aaron
looked so
surprised,
so puzzled,
as she
reached down
and touched
the knife,
like she
couldn't
believe it
was real.
Amanda
could see
traces of
cat whiskers
beneath the
blue face
paint.
Mom?
Mom?
