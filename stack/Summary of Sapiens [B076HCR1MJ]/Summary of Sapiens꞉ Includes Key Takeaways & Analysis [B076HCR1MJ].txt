Executive Summary
Sapiens, A Brief History of Humankind
by Yuval Noah Harari
traces the history of Homo sapiens
from human evolution 2.5 million years ago
to the present day.
Harari tackles such fundamental questions
as what makes humans uniquely human
and whether or not human happiness
and well-being has increased
over the course of history.
In Part I, Harari explains
how humans evolved
from the great ape family.
Special emphasis is placed on the fact
that humans are animals
no different from chimpanzees
or fruit flies
and like all other animals
are subject to the laws
of biology and nature.
In Part I, Harari attempts to paint life
as a hunter-gatherer,
explaining a fundamental understanding
of prehistoric human life
is key to understanding human anxieties
and ambitions in the 21st century.
The Agricultural Revolution
and first chapter in human history
is tackled in Part II.
Harari discusses the rise of empires
and writing and focuses on the fact
that human brains are no more complex today
than they were 10,000 years ago.
Part III tackles the development of money
and economic systems,
as well as politics, religion,
and imperial desires.
In this section, Harari explains
culture is a powerful driving force
that has proven time and time again
to override the natural laws of evolution.
The final section of Sapiens
zooms in on the scientific revolution
and the 500-year period
of unprecedented growth
that has caused widespread change
around the globe.
Harari makes the argument
that history is moving
toward a single global empire
and the total collapse
of the family unit
and local community.
In the final chapter,
Harari speculates about a future
in which intelligent design
alters completely
who Homo sapiens are as a species.
Sapiens is humbling
and causes several moments of pause
to wonder how things
could have been different
and what the next chapter
of humankind could possibly be.
Part I.
The Cognitive Revolution
Chapter 1.
An Animal of No Significance
Biologists use the term species
to classify animals
that mate together
and successfully produce offspring
and genus
to describe species
that evolved
from a single common ancestor.
So although a horse
and a donkey
are not of the same species,
they share a common ancestor
and are thus members
of the same genus.
To classify different animals,
biologists use the Latin name
for the genus
followed by that for the species.
The Latin name for humans
is Homo sapiens
because humans are animals
from the genus or family
known as Homo.
Homo sapiens,
modern humans,
are members of a big family
known as great apes.
Our closest relatives
are chimpanzees.
Just six million years ago,
a single female ape
had two children.
One became a chimpanzee,
the other a human.
Scientists agree,
humans,
not just Homo sapiens,
first evolved
2.5 million years ago
in East Africa.
Approximately 500,000 years
after evolving
from the southern ape,
a group of humans
left East Africa
to settle North Africa,
Europe,
and Asia.
Each
of these geographic areas
has different
environmental conditions,
which is why
prehistoric humans
who settled
in different parts of the world
further evolved
into different species,
each with its own traits
and characteristics.
For example,
humans who migrated
to Europe
and Western Asia
evolved into
Homo neanderthalentesis,
Neanderthals,
while those
who settled
in Eastern Asia
evolved into
a species known
as Homo erectus,
upright man.
It is unknown
exactly how many
species of humans
lived at one time
or another.
The ancestors
of the modern human
did not exist
on a timeline,
one evolving
from the next,
but rather simultaneously,
evolving in order
to survive
in a particular environment.
Just as there are
several species
of dogs,
cats,
pigs,
or fish
at one time,
there were
many species
of humans.
Similarly,
as there are traits
and characteristics
that unite
all species of fish,
there are certain
defining characteristics
shared among
all Homo sapiens
and our extinct
Homo brothers
and sisters.
All species
of humans
have relatively
large brains,
which grew
over the course
of evolution
for reasons
still unknown.
Second,
all humans
walk upright
on two legs.
Walking upright
not only
freed human hands
to do things
like make tools,
but also resulted
in females
with narrower hips
and narrower
birth canals.
To accommodate
the challenge
of a narrow
birth canal,
female humans
give birth prematurely
when the heads
of babies
are supple enough
to squeeze
through the birth canal.
While cults
can trot shortly
after birth,
human babies
are born helpless.
This is why
humans are
such social animals.
It literally
takes a village
to raise a child.
In prehistoric times,
a single mother
could not leave
her helpless baby
to forage for food.
In order for
a human child
to survive,
the mother depended
on strong social ties
to her neighbors.
Further,
because humans
are born underdeveloped,
they have a greater
capacity for education
and socialization
than do infants
of other animals.
For two million years,
animals with the traits
that make humans
uniquely human
were of no greater
importance
than any other
animal species.
Just like all other animals,
prehistoric humans,
despite their tools
and capacity for education,
feared predators,
gathered plants,
and stalked
small animals.
Humans were not
on top of the food chain.
In fact,
they were smack dab
in the middle.
It was only
fairly recently,
400,000 years ago,
that humans
started hunting
while still being hunted
by larger game.
And only with the rise
of our own species,
Homo sapiens,
a mere 100,000 years ago,
have humans
climbed the food chain.
This transition
has not been smooth.
When other animals
slowly evolved
to climb the food chain,
so did the ecosystem
around them.
For example,
when lions
became deadlier,
their prey,
gazelle,
became faster.
This slow process
of evolution
gave lions
a certain self-confidence
and pride
in their power.
Homo sapiens,
on the other hand,
ascended so quickly
they did not have
the time and space
to evolve psychologically.
This is why humans
today are riddled
with fear
and anxiety.
One of the reasons
humans rose so quickly
on the food chain
is because they learned
to domesticate fire.
As early as 300,000 years ago,
Homo erectus
and Homo neanderthalentesis
were using fire daily.
Fire was a deadly weapon,
as well as a source
of light and warmth.
But fire was most important
for its cooking capabilities.
Humans are the only animals
that cook.
This is important
because cooking
kills germs and parasites
and makes it easier
to digest food.
Cooking significantly
cut down the time
a human needed
to spend looking for
and consuming food
each day.
For example,
chimpanzees spend
five hours a day
chewing raw food,
whereas humans
need only one hour
to consume
the same number
of calories.
Some scholars
theorize cooking
is responsible
for shortening
the human intestinal tract
and growing
the human brain.
This is because
both these systems
require a lot of energy.
When digesting
became easier
and quicker
due to consumption
of cooked food,
more energy
could be diverted
to the brain.
150,000 years ago,
Homo sapiens
evolved in East Africa.
They had smaller teeth
and jaws
than their human relatives,
but their brains
were bigger.
They looked
just like we do today.
Approximately 70,000 years ago,
Homo sapiens
began leaving East Africa
and spreading
to the Arabian Peninsula
and later
to all of Eurasia.
When this happened,
Homo sapiens
were living side by side
with other human species.
But something happened
that made the other humans
become extinct.
Two major theories
explain this phenomenon.
The interbreeding theory
states Homo sapiens
bred with other human species
like the mixing
of two dog species.
If this theory is true,
then today's Eurasia population
is not purebred sapiens,
but rather a mix
of sapiens
and Neanderthal.
Meanwhile,
Chinese and Korean populations
are a mix
of sapiens
and Erectus.
The more popular
major theory,
the replacement theory,
states Homo sapiens
could not successfully breed
with other human species.
Homo sapiens
either killed
their human relatives
in a mass genocide,
or drove them
to extinction
in the competition
for resources.
Whatever the cause,
the other human species
became extinct
and Homo sapiens
replaced
all other human species.
According to this theory,
all humans today
are pure sapiens
that can be traced
to a single mother
in East Africa
born 70,000 years ago.
This is important
because if the replacement theory
is true,
all humans today
have nearly identical
genetic information
and any racial differences
are negligible.
Whatever truly happened
is still a mystery.
What we know for sure
is that other human species
started disappearing
50,000 years ago
and the last human species,
the dwarf humans
of Flores Island,
died out just 12,000 years ago.
Key Takeaways
Prehistoric humans
were of not greater significance
than any other animal species.
Modern and prehistoric humans
share
1. large brains
2. ability to walk upright
3. use of tools
4. superior learning abilities
and 5. complex social structures
The domestication of fire
is responsible
for humans' rapid ascent
on the food chain.
All humans
likely share
a single maternal ancestor
born 70,000 years ago
in East Africa.
Chapter 2
The Tree of Knowledge
As of 30,000 years ago,
Homo sapiens
had invented boats,
oil lamps,
bows and arrows,
and needles for sewing.
It was also at this time
that humans
started practicing religion,
commerce,
and social stratification.
In the 40,000 years
after Homo sapiens
dominated all other human species,
there was a cognitive revolution
that made our 30,000-year-old ancestors
equally as intelligent,
creative,
and sensitive
as we are today.
How and why
the cognitive revolution occurred
remains a mystery.
Some scholars argue
accidental genetic mutations,
known as the Tree of Knowledge mutation,
changed the wiring
of sapiens' brains,
enabling humans to think
and communicate
in ways never before possible.
One consequence
of the Tree of Knowledge mutation
was the rise of a language
that is able to connect
a limited number of sounds
and signs
to an infinite number
of distinct
and often complex meanings.
Some believe human language
evolved as a way
to share information,
or in other words,
to gossip.
This theory holds ground
because Homo sapiens
are an inherently social species.
In order to survive
and reproduce,
humans need social cooperation.
Language,
and most specifically gossip,
is the most important element
of social cooperation.
With this development,
humans could discuss
who was to be trusted
and how to expand their groups.
Although the gossip theory
may sound silly,
one only needs to think
of how naturally gossip
comes to people
to realize it is very possible
language evolved
for this exact purpose.
While other animal species
have the ability
to communicate,
especially when it comes
to issues of food and danger,
human language is unique
for its capacity
to transmit information
about things
that do not exist,
such as legends,
myths,
gods,
and religions.
The ability to imagine
and discuss friction
not only on an individual
but also on a collective scale
uniquely affords Homo sapiens
the ability to cooperate
flexibly in large numbers.
The key to cooperation
on a large scale,
more than 150 individuals,
is the ability
to collectively believe
in a common fiction.
This is why myths
have always been
and always will be key
to the rise and survival
of all cooperative efforts,
from modern states
to archaic tribes.
The power to create
and convince other humans
of social constructs
or imagined realities
is what has allowed
vast groups of human strangers
to work together
toward common goals.
The imagined realities
that sapiens invented
resulted in diverse social patterns
known as culture.
The changes and developments
of culture
are what we call history.
In science,
human activity
prior to the cognitive revolution
is relegated to the field
of biology.
The cognitive revolution
marks the beginning
of history
or the study
of the development
of the animal species
known as Homo sapiens.
It is important
to realize, however,
that the cognitive revolution
does not exempt
human history
from biology.
Biology dictates
the behavior
and capacities
of humans,
just as it does
for all other animal species.
On an individual
and familial level,
humans are incredibly similar
to their ape cousins.
The differences
between humans
and other apes
are only evident
when groups of humans
reach more than 150 individuals,
a phenomenon
only possible
with the collective belief
in social constructs
and imagined realities.
Key Takeaways
The major development
in the cognitive revolution
was the ability
to transmit
larger quantities
of information
about the world
surrounding humans,
social relationships
between humans,
gossip,
and imagined realities,
myths,
legends,
religions,
gods,
states,
laws,
etc.
On an individual
and familial level,
human behavior
is very similar
to that
of other great apes.
The uniquely human ability
to collectively believe
in myths
allows strangers
to cooperate.
Chapter 3
A Day in the Life
of Adam and Eve
Hunter-Gatherer
was the identity
of Homo sapiens
for tens of thousands
of years
before humans
began farming
and herding.
The social
and psychological
characteristics
of modern humans
are the results
of hunter-gatherer history.
Everything,
from eating habits
to sexuality,
is predicated
on the hunter-gatherer
experience
and the way
pre-agricultural minds
interact with
the foreign environment
of post-industrial society.
For example,
the human proclivity
for gorging
on high-calorie,
low-nutrient sweets
can be traced
to a time
when human ancestors
ate entire trees
of ripe fruits
when they came
across them,
a win in the competition
for resources.
It is likely
that some ancient
hunter-gatherer societies
were communal
while others
were based
on monogamy.
Because Homo sapiens
are capable
of an infinite number
of imagined realities,
life for two neighboring
bands of humans
could be made
of different religions,
languages,
social structures,
rituals,
and habits.
It is for this reason
that there is no
natural way of life
for humans.
There are only
cultural choices.
While hunter-gatherer societies
were vastly different
from one another,
they did share
some similarities.
Most were comprised
of several dozen
or even several hundred
members of humans
and no other animals.
The only exception
is the dog,
which was domesticated
by humans
at least 15,000 years ago
for hunting,
fighting,
and alerting
their masters
to invasion.
Within a single band,
members knew
one another intimately
as friends
and relatives.
Bands competed
and fought
with one another
for resources
and also cooperated
by exchanging members,
trading luxury items,
forming political alliances,
and celebrating
religious festivals.
Bands of prehistoric humans
were nomadic
and traveled dozens
or hundreds of miles
based on changing seasons,
animal migration,
and plant cycles.
While humans only settled
on rare occasions,
when they did,
they usually set up
fishing villages
along seas and rivers.
Drying,
smoking,
and freezing food
further enabled
homo sapiens
to remain in one place
for longer periods of time.
Gathering was the main
activity for humans.
Hunting came second.
Humans not only foraged
for roots and berries,
but also for knowledge
about plants and animals,
as well as environments
and seasons.
Human ancestors
were great experts
and highly skilled peoples.
Survival required
great mental capacity.
Some scientists
even suggest
the size of the human brain
has actually decreased
since the time
when humans relied
on foraging for survival.
A varied diet
was responsible
for long, healthy lives
of in between 60 and 80 years.
It also helped
that foragers
rarely came in contact
with infectious diseases,
most of which
come from domesticated animals
or living in dense,
unhygienic settlements.
Prehistoric societies
believed in animism,
a worldview
in which all places,
animals,
plants,
and natural phenomena,
including spirits
and other unseen forces,
have awareness
and feelings
and are able
to directly communicate
with humans
through song,
dance,
talk,
and other rituals.
Animism
is local,
meaning a shaman
may communicate
with a single deceased elder,
but not a universal god.
And because prehistoric humans
had animist beliefs,
they did not imagine
a hierarchical,
universal order,
but instead believed
all entities
were equal
to one another.
Key takeaways
Humans today
experience anxiety
and fear
because biologically
humans still fear
being eaten.
There is no natural way
of life.
Prehistoric humans
had expert knowledge,
great mental capacity,
and were highly skilled.
Foragers
lived between
60 and 80 years
because they ate
a varied diet.
Prehistoric humans
viewed humans
as equal to,
not higher than,
other animals.
Chapter 4
The Flood
Prior to the
Cognitive Revolution,
humans exclusively lived
on Afro-Asian landmasses.
They lived in ecosystems
that evolved over millennia
in unique and distinct ways.
Homo sapiens, however,
would forever uproot
the unique biology
of Earth's distinct landmasses.
Australia
was the first part
of the outer world
invaded by sapiens.
Scholars are unsure
how exactly humans
achieved this feat,
but many believe
the 45,000 years-old
populations of Indonesia
were the first
seafaring peoples
to develop the skill
of building boats
capable of sailing
across oceans.
This event
was remarkable
because it was
the first time
Homo sapiens
or any other
large land mammal
crossed from Afro-Asia
to Australia.
This single event
is what allowed humans
to climb the food chain
and effectively
dominate planet Earth.
For the first time,
humans did not merely
adapt to a new environment,
they changed it.
When humans
landed on Australia,
they found a land
populated by marsupial mammals
that give birth
to helpless infants
nurtured with milk
in abdominal pouches
like kangaroos
and megafauna
like birds
twice the size
of ostriches.
Nearly all of these species
became extinct
shortly after
the arrival of humans.
scholars mostly agree
this is because
in other lands,
animals had
two million years
to adapt
to human predators
whose own hunting skills
slowly evolved
over millennia.
The sudden invasion
of humans
meant megafauna
on Australia
did not stand a chance.
This was a pattern
that would repeat
time and time again
in other outer world lands
like New Zealand,
the Americas,
and thousands of islands.
Humans were also
devastating
for new ecosystems
because as early
as 45,000 years ago,
sapiens practiced
fire agriculture
or the vast burning
of dense forests
to create open grasslands.
16,000 years ago,
Homo sapiens
were the first human species
to reach the Americas.
They arrived on foot
by way of the land bridge
connecting northeastern Siberia
and northwestern Alaska.
Within no more
than 2,000 years,
humans decimated
countless species
of unique flora
and fauna
across both
North and South America.
This first wave
of colonization
and the subsequent
mass extinctions
were the greatest
ecological disaster
to ever hit
planet Earth.
Key Takeaways
45,000 years ago,
humans built
ocean-faring boats
and sailed
from Afro-Asia
to Australia.
The arrival of humans
in Australia,
New Zealand,
and the Americas
caused mass extinctions
because the unique
flora and fauna
of these lands
did not have time
to adapt
to human predators.
Part 2
The Agricultural Revolution
Chapter 5
History's Biggest Fraud
The Agricultural Revolution
began approximately
10,000 years ago
in southeastern Turkey,
western Iran,
and the Levant.
First,
wheat and goat
were domesticated
and then peas and lentils.
Olive trees and horses
followed 5,000 years ago.
In other words,
the Agricultural Revolution
had a slow start.
But by 3500 BC,
90% of the plants
and animals
that feed modern humans
in the 21st century
were domesticated
by human ancestors.
In fact,
no new plant
or animal
has been domesticated
in the last 2,000 years.
At the same time,
Middle Eastern ancestors
began practicing agriculture.
So did humans
in China
and Central America.
The Agricultural Revolution
was no great leap
in brain power,
nor was it a feat
of great progress.
Homo sapiens brains
are the same now
as they were
a hundred thousand years ago.
Ancient hunter-gatherers
were great experts
with fantastic knowledge
of plants and animals.
They worked fewer hours
than we do today
and led generally stimulating
and satisfying lives.
The Agricultural Revolution
did not make things easier,
but in fact,
made life more difficult
and less satisfying.
Farmers were now reliant
on their crops
and faced disease,
starvation,
malnutrition,
not to mention
boring diets.
So how did
the Agricultural Revolution
happen?
Contrary to belief,
humans did not
domesticate plants
and animals.
Wheat, rice,
and potatoes
domesticated humans.
Over thousands of years,
humans made small changes
in their habits
that eventually led
to permanent settlements
in favor of nomadic lifestyles.
This largely has to do
with the way humans
accidentally spread wheat
by dropping small grains
and thus contributing
to its widespread growth.
As more wheat grew,
humans devoted
more and more time
to its cultivation
until there was little
to no time left
for hunting and gathering.
Wheat and similar crops
enabled humans
to multiply their populations
exponentially.
Whereas hunter-gatherer women
typically spaced out
their children
every three or four years,
farmer women
could have babies
every year.
But the subsequent populations
were not healthy.
Babies were deprived
of their mother's milk
and were instead
weaned on cereals.
These and similar practices
led to weaker immune systems
and shorter lives
marked by illness.
In essence,
the story of the
agricultural revolution
is one of keeping
more people alive
under worse conditions.
Nomadic humans
eventually changed
the genetic compositions
of the herds they hunted.
For example,
centuries of slaughtering
aggressive rams
and skinny females
bred a population
of submissive fat sheep.
Over time,
animals were domesticated
to provide food,
raw materials,
and muscle power.
The rise of farming
also gave rise
to the domestication
of animals,
as humans increasingly relied
on animals
to cultivate plants.
The agricultural revolution
began 10,000 years ago
with the domestication
of wheat.
Agriculture
made life more difficult
and led to disease,
starvation,
and malnutrition.
It is not a story
of progress,
but rather one
of keeping more people alive
under harrowing conditions.
Chapter 6
Building Pyramids
By the first century A.D.,
only one to two million
foragers remained.
In comparison,
a whopping 250 million farmers
now populated the planet.
Whereas hunter-gatherer societies
lived on several dozens
and sometimes many miles of land,
peasant farmers
had limited patches of fields
and small structures
made from wood,
stone,
or mud,
the house,
to call home.
When humans separated
themselves from nature
and their fellow human neighbors,
they became increasingly
self-centered
and possessive
of the area
they called home.
The agricultural revolution
also introduced
anxieties about the future.
Whereas hunter-gatherers
likely did not worry
about future events
out of their control
and were instead concerned
with what they would eat
that very day,
the seasonal cycle
of farming
and its inherent unpredictability
required long-term planning
and plenty of worry.
Stress associated with farming
became the foundation
of political and social systems.
From these permanent settlements
rose rulers
and elite classes
who lived off the fruits
of peasants'
back-breaking labor.
Forfeiting food surpluses
became the foundation
for everything
from politics and war
to art and philosophy.
For the majority of history
until the late modern era,
ninety percent of humans
were peasants
who tilled land
in order to feed the elite.
It is important
to remember history
as told in history books
is something that happened
to very few people.
The rest of the human species
was limited to the same doldrums
of farm work for millennia.
History shows
that times of greatest conflict
come at moments
of greatest wealth.
Therefore,
it is not food shortage
that causes wars,
but rather the inability
for mass cooperation
at such large scale.
Humans are hardwired
to cooperate with groups
of up to 150 people.
There has not been enough time
for human biology
to evolve
beyond the natural inclination
to live and work
among bands
of a few dozen individuals.
Empires, cities,
and the mass cooperation
they demand
are unnatural
to human biology,
which is still programmed
for roaming the savannah.
Nevertheless,
human imagination
moved at a much faster pace
than did human evolution.
Myths about gods,
states,
and stocks
persuaded thousands
and then millions
of strangers
to cooperate.
Between 3100
and 221 BC,
the entire lower Nile Valley
united as the first
Egyptian kingdom,
mega-empires
with many millions
of subjects,
and tens of thousands
of soldiers
arose in the Middle East,
40 million people
in China
united as the
Qin Dynasty,
and the Mediterranean
Basin united
as the Roman Empire,
which at its height
boasted a hundred million subjects.
It must not be forgotten
that cooperation,
especially at such large scale
as to unite an empire,
is seldom peaceful
and often coaxed
by force,
oppression,
and exploitation.
To function,
the leaders and subjects
of empires
and concentration camps alike
must believe
in an imagined order
in which social norms
are based
not on biology,
but rather
on the shared belief
in myths.
The American Declaration
for Independence
is, for example,
a manual for cooperation
predicated on myth.
It claims
a divine power,
God,
guarantees life,
liberty,
and the pursuit
of happiness,
and promises
if humans
act according
to the sacred principles
listed in the Constitution,
they will be able
to cooperate.
The universal principles
of life,
liberty,
and pursuit
of justice,
do not exist anywhere
except in the imagination
of an animal species
known as Homo sapiens.
An imagined order,
such as the American
Declaration of Independence,
is the only way
large numbers of humans
can cooperate effectively,
and yet imagined orders
are in constant danger
of collapse
because they are
completely dependent
upon myth.
Once people stop believing
in a particular myth,
it vanishes.
This is when coups occur,
or when children
discover Santa Claus
does not exist.
Therefore,
imagined orders
are safeguarded,
often with violence
and coercion.
When the majority
of Americans
change their imagined order
so that Africans
were no longer slaves,
but were now equal humans,
a bloody civil war
became necessary
to convince
the southern states
of this new order.
But violence
is not the only way
to sustain
an imagined myth.
Priests are one example
of true believers
whose unyielding faith
is a powerful tool
of persuasion
and cooperation.
Likewise,
if American presidents
and investors
did not truly believe
in the American state
and capitalism,
these myths
would have long ago
collapsed.
In order to persuade
people to believe
in an imagined order,
myth-makers
must never doubt
the imagined order
is objective fact
created by great gods
or laws of nature.
It is also imperative
to thoroughly educate
people on the principles
of the imagined order.
Fairy tales,
dramas,
paintings,
songs,
etiquette,
propaganda,
architecture,
recipes,
and fashion
are all tools
in the great program
of the imagined order.
The main factors
that prevent
the majority
of humans
from realizing
the order
that organizes
their lives
exists
only in their imagination
are as follows.
The imagined order
is embedded
in the real material world,
its shapes
our desires,
and is intersubjective,
meaning it exists
in the shared consciousness
of millions
of individuals.
Laws,
money,
gods,
and nations
are all
intersubjective
phenomenon.
Key takeaways
Humans
are biologically
programmed
to work
with no more
than 150 individuals.
This is why
empires and cities
of thousands
or millions
of people
are unnatural
and tend
to lead
to conflict.
In order
for thousands
of strangers
to cooperate,
they must share
beliefs
and imagined realities
or myths
about such things
as gods,
states,
and stocks.
Imagined orders
are safeguarded
through violence
and embedded
in the material world.
Chapter 7
Memory Overload
In the first
few thousand years
of the agricultural
revolution,
human social networks
remained relatively small.
For the more
than two million years
that humans
roamed the earth,
they never had
the need
to store information
more complex
than what they could
store in their brains.
But with the growth
of kingdoms
and empires
came the need
for taxes
and thus
mathematics.
The Sumerians
of southern Mesopotamia
were the first
to devise a system
of processing
and storing
that released
human social order
outside the human brain.
This system
is writing.
Writing uses
material signs
to store information.
The only writing
that survives
from Sumerian times
is clay tablets
related to accounting
and lists of words
copied over
and over again,
presumably
as exercises
for scribes
in training.
This early script
was partial script,
meaning it only conveys
partial meaning.
Mathematical symbols
and musician notation
are examples
of partial script.
Between 3000
and 2500 BC,
the Sumerian
partial script
developed into
a full script
and was used
to issue decrees,
record oracles,
and write
personal letters.
At around the same time
the Sumerians
started using cuneiform,
the Egyptians
developed hieroglyphics.
Soon after,
populations in China
and Central America
independently developed
other full scripts.
Not only did the people
of Sumer,
Egypt,
China,
and Inca
invent writing systems,
but they also developed
techniques for archiving,
cataloging,
and retrieving
written records.
There is even evidence
that schools
were established
to train
professional scribes,
clerks,
librarians,
and accountants
in topics
of data processing.
Around the 9th century BC,
an important development
was made
in the language
of numbers.
The Hindus
invented the partial script
of ten signs
to represent the numbers
zero to nine.
They are called
Arabic numerals,
however,
because when the Arabs
invaded India,
they adopted
and refined the system
before spreading it
throughout the Middle East
and Europe.
This writing system
of mathematical script
has become
the most popular language
in the world.
Key Takeaways
The Sumerians
invented writing
more than 5,000 years ago.
Ancient populations
of Sumer,
Egypt,
China,
and Inca
developed methods
for archiving,
cataloging,
and retrieving
written records,
as well as schools
for scribes
and accountants.
The system
of Arabic numerals
zero to ten
is the most popular
language in the world
today.
It has been used
since its invention
in the ninth century
by Hindus in India.
Chapter 8
There is no justice
in history
Large-scale human networks
from the agricultural
revolution
until today
are sustained
by imagined orders
of invented hierarchies
that are neither
neutral nor fair.
Few enjoy privileges
and powers
only possible
with the oppression
and discrimination
of many.
When the American
Declaration of Independence
was signed,
it placed white men
on the upper echelons
and relegated women,
blacks,
and American Indians
to the bottom rungs.
Those at the top
believed that they
had a God-granted right
to liberty and power,
while those at the bottom
did not.
It seems a strange phenomenon
that imagined hierarchies
and unjust discrimination
exist in all human societies.
Hierarchies dictate
how strangers
should treat one another
without needing to know people
on an individual basis.
But how do such hierarchies arise
and what accounts
for their differences?
In other words,
why did traditional
Indian societies
classify people
according to class,
Ottomans according to religion,
and Americans
according to race?
The answer lies
in accidental
historical circumstances
that are perpetuated
and refined
over generations
with the support
of myths.
Hierarchies
have no basis
in biology or logic,
and while hierarchies
based on different criteria
exist,
the gender hierarchy
remains consistent.
Biologically,
humans are divided
into males and females.
Men and women
are not biological.
They are social categories
built from cultural myths
in imagined human orders.
In other words,
sex is biological
and gender is cultural.
Masculine and feminine
are intersubjective,
meaning they are constantly
changing imagined realities
believed by many humans.
For example,
for the majority
of human history,
masculinity has been associated
with colorful
and flamboyant accessories,
i.e. wigs,
stockings,
and high heels
of European kings,
feathered headdresses
of American Indian chiefs,
silks and diamonds
of Hindu maharajas.
Yet,
in the twenty-first century,
such accessories
are considered effeminate.
While a person
is born
with his or her sex,
it takes a lifetime
to prove
one's manliness
or femininity.
Men,
in particular,
spend their lives
making sacrifices
and enacting rituals
in order to be accepted
as a man.
This is true
in most human societies,
as is the fact
that patriarchy
has been the norm
in almost all agricultural
and industrial societies.
The reason why
is still unknown.
There are a number
of theories
to suggest
why manhood
is almost universally
valued over womanhood.
Some theorize men
are biologically
stronger than women
and have therefore
monopolized manual labor
and taken control
of food supply.
But problems
with this theory
include the fact
that women are stronger
than men
when it comes
to resistance to hunger,
disease,
and fatigue,
and there is no
direct link
between physical strength
and social power.
Another theory
is based on male aggression.
While hormonal
and cognitive studies
show that men
are biologically
more aggressive
and violent
than women,
it does not make sense
that the ones
who wage war
must also be
the benefactors
of war.
A third theory
suggests that
in order to survive
and reproduce,
men evolved
to be ambitious,
aggressive,
and competitive
because they needed
to compete
for female attention.
Women,
on the other hand,
had their pick of men
and did not need
to compete,
but they did need
to rely on men
to help raise children.
Therefore,
the feminine gene
that survived
was submissive caretaker.
The problem
with this theory
is that humans
lived in bands
of a few dozen humans
for more than
two million years,
so why would women
necessarily
have been dependent
on men
as opposed
to networks
of women?
Further,
male competitiveness
in other animal species
such as elephants
and bonobo chimpanzees
leads to
matriarchal societies.
Considering the holes
in these theories
and the speed
at which gender roles
have suddenly changed
in the 21st century,
scientists are more
unsure than ever
as to why
the patriarchal system
has persisted
almost universally
in human history.
Biology enables,
culture forbids.
According to this mantra,
biology tolerates
a wide spectrum
of possibilities,
while culture
perverts biology
to dictate
what is natural
and what is forbidden.
For example,
some cultures
state homosexuality
is unnatural
and thus forbidden.
This is simply
not true.
Biology enables men
to enjoy sex
with other men.
From a biological perspective,
whatever is possible
is natural.
Nothing is unnatural.
A truly natural behavior
that goes against
the laws of nature,
i.e., man to photosynthesize,
simply cannot exist.
It's impossible.
What the Western world
uses as a basis
for natural and unnatural
is not biology,
but rather Christian theology.
Christian theology dictates
God created all living things
with organs and limbs
that have specific,
natural purposes.
In reality,
evolution has no purpose.
organs and limbs
are in constant flux
and their purposes
are constantly changing.
Mouths, for example,
originally appeared
on multicellular organisms
for the sole purpose
of taking nutrients
into their bodies.
Over the course of evolution,
mouths have developed
a multitude of other functions
outside their original
intended purpose.
Is it therefore unnatural
to speak or kiss?
Key Takeaways
Empires and nations
are only possible
when the many thousands
or millions of people
in them
collectively believe
in an imagined order
of invented hierarchies,
i.e.,
India's caste system.
In almost all cultures,
men are valued above women.
Scientists do not
understand why.
Whatever is biologically
possible is natural.
There are no unnatural behaviors,
only culturally forbidden ones.
Part 3
The Unification
of Humankind
Chapter 9
The Arrow
of History
Culture is a network
of artificial instincts.
These artificial instincts
are myths and fictions
that accustom humans
to think and behave
in certain ways
from birth.
The norms,
beliefs,
and values of a culture
are in constant flux
and transform
in response
to changes
in a culture's environment
through interaction
with other cultures
and as a result
of shifting internal dynamics.
Cultures change
because imagined orders
are inherently fraught
with internal contradictions.
The attempt
to reconcile
these contradictions
produces change.
An example
is the belief
in contradictory values
of equality
and individual freedom.
Equality
is only possible
at the expense
of individual freedom.
Contradictions
are not bad,
but they are required
for the human species
to be creative
and dynamic.
differences
force humans
to think,
re-evaluate,
and criticize.
They also mean
culture is driven
by tension
and conflict.
Cultures are
in constant flux,
but they do seem
to be heading
in the same direction
of singular unity.
Since the agricultural
revolution,
small cultures
have coalesced
into larger
and more complex
civilizations.
Around 10,000 B.C.,
Earth contained
many thousands
of isolated human worlds
that existed
independently
of one another.
By A.D. 1450,
close to 90%
of humans
were connected
by cultural,
economic,
and political ties
on the mega-world
of Afro-Asia.
The other 10%
could be found
in the Mesoamerican,
Andean,
Australian,
and Oceanic worlds.
Today,
the vast majority
of humans
share a single
geopolitical,
economic,
legal,
and scientific system.
Although this
global culture
is in no way
homogenous,
the humans
that operate
within it
are all closely
connected
and influenced
by one another.
The last few centuries
have imposed
global influences
on nearly all cultures.
If authentic
means something
that developed
independently
and is free
of external influences,
then there are
no authentic
cultures left
on planet Earth.
Ethnic cuisine,
for example,
is anything
but authentic.
Although Italian
pasta is characterized
by tomato sauce
and Indian curries
by chili peppers,
neither tomatoes
nor chili peppers
are native
to Italy
or India,
respectively.
Both
come from Mexico
and only reached
Europe and Asia
after the Spaniards
conquered Mexico.
Another example
is the characterization
of American Indians
riding horses.
There were no horses
in America
until the Europeans
brought them
in 1492.
American Indians
riding horses
is not authentic.
It is globalized
and modern.
Humans evolved
to think in terms
of us
and them.
Although humans
are the first
social animals
to cooperate
with strangers
and to be guided
by the interests
of the entire species,
imagined orders
still cause humans
to ignore
substantial parts
of the species.
In the first
millennia B.C.,
three universal
imagined orders,
economic and monetary,
political,
and religious,
arose,
enabling humans
to envision
an entire species
of us
governed by
a single set of laws.
Merchants
saw the entire
human species
as potential customers.
Conquerors
envisioned all humans
as potential subjects,
and prophets
saw all humans
as potential believers.
The ways
in which money,
empires,
and religion spread
define the united world
we inhabit today.
Key Takeaways
Humans and culture
have inherent contradictions
which led
to conflict
and change.
Cultures
are moving
towards worldwide
singular unity.
Imagined orders
cause people
to think
in terms of us
and them.
Chapter 10
The Scent
of Money
Money is an
intersubjective reality
that exists
in a cultural
shared imagination.
Money is important
because it enables
humans to quickly
compare the value
of different commodities,
make equal exchanges,
and conveniently
store wealth.
While coins
are the most
universally used
form of money,
money has materialized
in every form
from skins
to salt.
Today,
only an approximate
$6 trillion
of the $60 trillion
that exist
in the world
exists as coins
and banknotes.
The other 90%
exists only
on computer servers.
Money,
as a universal
medium of exchange,
is necessary
in a complex
commercial system.
Money is not
a material reality,
but rather
a psychological
construct
that converts
matter into mind.
Because humans
collectively believe
a $5 bill,
shells,
or cigarettes
have a particular value,
money is the human
world's most
universal
and efficient
system of mutual
trust.
Without trust,
there would be
no money,
and without money,
there would be
no commercial
system.
The trust that
created the complex
and long-term
economic system
is intrinsically
tied to networks
of political,
social,
and ideological
relations.
This is why
the dollar bill
says,
in God we trust,
and has the signature
of the U.S.
Secretary of the
Treasury.
We trust God
and the government,
and therefore
trust the U.S.
dollar as a form
of money that can
be converted into
goods and services.
The first money,
without inherent
biological value,
i.e.
Sumerian barley,
can be consumed,
was the silver shekel
used in 3rd
millennium B.C.
Mesopotamia.
Silver,
like gold,
has no inherent value.
It is a soft metal
that cannot be made
into tools,
and it certainly
cannot be consumed.
For all of human history,
silver and gold
have been culturally
valued as luxury goods
and status symbols.
The first precious metal
coins were made
around 640 B.C.
in western Anatolia.
Coins used around
the world today
owe their history
to these ancient
prototypes.
By the late modern era,
the entire world
used the same
monetary system,
based first
on gold and silver,
and later
on trusted currencies
such as the British
pound and the
American dollar.
This transnational
and transcultural
monetary zone
paved the way
for a global
economic and
political sphere.
Although humans
around the world
speak different
languages,
obey different leaders,
and worship
different gods,
they all agree
and trust
the same money.
Once trade
connects two areas,
the forces of
supply and demand
equalize the price
of goods,
essentially forcing
the two cultures
to trust that the
other believes
in the same money.
In other words,
if Indians
have no use
for gold,
but Europeans do,
the fact that
the Europeans
want gold
is enough
to make the
Indians value it.
Money is the
only system
of trust
capable of
bridging cultural
gaps and enabling
complete strangers
to cooperate
efficiently.
Money is based
on principles
of universal
convertibility,
meaning it can be
turned into anything
from loyalty
to knowledge
and universal
trust.
Although money
is undeniably
beneficial,
it is also evil
for the way it uses
the laws of supply
and demand
to usurp
and corrode
local traditions,
intimate relations,
and human values.
Key takeaways
Money is
intersubjective,
which means
it only exists
because millions
believe it exists.
Money is based
on a system
of mutual trust,
intrinsically tied
to political,
social,
and ideological
systems.
This is why
American money
says,
In God
We Trust.
A transcultural
monetary zone
based on trust
in a few
major currencies,
first gold
and silver,
now the American
dollar,
and British pound,
makes global
economies
and politics
possible.
Money is the
only system
that effectively
bridges cultural
gaps.
It also
erodes them.
Chapter 11
Imperial Visions
An empire
is a political
order with
flexible borders
that continually
seeks to expand
and which rules
over a significant
number of
distinct peoples
with different
cultural identities
and separate
territories.
Empires,
therefore,
unite diverse
ethnic groups
and ecological
areas and
thus enmesh
large segments
of the human
species and
planet Earth.
Empires are not
defined by their
origins or given
by their forms
of government,
but rather by
their cultural
diversity and
flexible borders.
Yet,
empires are
largely responsible
for reducing
human diversity
because they
pack together
numerous peoples
under a single
umbrella,
effectively stripping
unique identities.
The empire
has been the
most common
form of political
organization
for the last
2,500 years.
Empires are
typically stable
and only falter
when the internal
ruling elite
splits or
outsiders invade.
This does not
mean life
inside an empire
is always good.
Empires subjugate
certain populations
for generations
until unique
markers of
particular cultures
are all but
erased.
When an empire
topples,
its people are
taken over
by a new empire.
Generally,
they are
characterized by
war,
enslavement,
deportation,
and genocide.
Yet,
some of history's
greatest philosophy
and art
owe their
development to
the exploitations
of conquered
populations.
The world's
most commonly
spoken languages
are further
artifacts of
imperial conquests.
Humans,
like all other
social animals,
are inherently
xenophobic,
meaning they fear
strangers and
divide the
species into
categories of
us versus
them.
Yet,
when Cyrus
the Great of
Persia began
his imperial
conquest around
550 BC,
he claimed he
was doing so
for all of
humankind.
He sought to
be inclusive
and all-encompassing,
going as far as
helping Jewish
exiles in Babylon
return to their
home in Judea
and rebuild
their temple.
The imperial
vision of
governing a
singular global
humanity with
equal responsibility
to all people
was passed from
Cyrus and the
Persians to
Alexander the
Great,
Hellenistic
kings,
Roman empires,
Muslim caliphs,
Indian dynasts,
Soviet premieres,
and American
presidents.
Independent of the
Persian model,
empires sprouted in
Central America,
the Andean region,
and in China.
The idea of the
benevolent empire
has been used to
justify acts of
violence and
oppression for all
of history.
Ruling elites
tend to adopt
ideas,
norms,
and traditions
from certain
populations in
order to make
their imperial
visions universal
and inclusive.
In the imperial
United States,
for example,
an American
president with
Kenyan heritage
can eat Italian
pizza while
watching Lawrence
of Arabia,
a British epic
about the Arab
rebellion against
the Turks.
America was not
the first cultural
melting pot.
Imperial Rome
was as much
Greek as it was
Roman.
In other words,
empires absorb
bits of all
conquered peoples.
It is necessary
for the success
of empires,
however,
to coerce
populations into
giving up their
unique identities
in favor of a
new imperial
culture.
The process
of being accepted
as us
by the ruling
elites
takes decades,
sometimes centuries,
and is often
painful.
Conquered peoples
are forced to
give up their
local cultures
while being forbidden
to fully and
equally take part
in their new
world.
In some empires,
generations of
acculturation and
assimilation
eventually result
in the merging
of us and them
as the old elite
finally accepts
conquered populations.
In China,
for example,
over the course
of 2,000 years,
countless ethnic
and cultural
groups originally
identified as
barbarian were
integrated into
imperial Chinese
culture.
Although the
Han ruled from
206 BC to
AD 200,
90% of Chinese
today in the
21st century
self-identify and
are identified by
others as
Han.
The decolonization
process is another
example of
successful integration.
In the massive
colonization
programs of the
European empires,
billions of people
in Indian,
African,
Arab,
Chinese,
and Maori's
lands adopted
French,
English,
and Spanish as
their national
languages.
They also adopted
Western values
such as human
rights,
self-determination,
liberalism,
capitalism,
feminism,
and nationalism,
and use these
exact values to
assert equality
with and
independence from
their European
conquerors.
Although it is
tempting to point
to all empires as
bad, it is
necessary to
recognize nearly
all of today's
cultures in the
21st century as
imperial legacies.
Since 2000 BC,
the majority of
humans have lived
in empires.
This trend will
likely continue.
However,
the way history
is moving causes
many to predict
the rise of a
single global
empire.
Nationalism is
falling away in
favor of humankind
as its own
legitimate source
of political
authority.
Further,
global problems
like climate
change make it
more imperative
than ever for
all humans to
cooperate.
And although the
world is composed
of nearly 200
independent states,
almost none of
these states have
full autonomy.
They cannot
execute independent
economic policies,
declare and wage
wars, or even
run internal
affairs without
influence of
global markets,
interference of
NGOs, and
supervision of
global public
opinion and the
international
judicial system.
Increasingly,
global standards
of financial
behavior,
environmental
policy, and
justice dictate
how states act
and govern.
The global
empire will not
be run by a
particular state
or ethnic
group, but
rather by a
multicultural elite
held together by
a common culture
and common
interests.
Key
Takeaways
An empire is a
political order
with flexible
borders that
continually seeks
to expand and
which rules over a
significant number
of distinct cultural
identities and
separate territories.
empires use
violence to
conquer and
erase certain
cultural identities.
They do so
while absorbing
bits and pieces
of subjugated
cultures in
order to appear
inclusive.
When an empire
crumbles, the
imperial culture
still flourishes.
The imperial
vision is to
govern a single
global humanity
with equal
responsibility to
all people.
This vision of
the benevolent
emperor has been
used for millennia
to justify
violence.
The world is
moving toward a
single global
empire ruled by
multicultural elites.
religion is
defined as a
system of human
norms and
values founded
on a belief in
a superhuman
order.
The norms and
values established
by religion are
binding and
referred to for
moral and
behavioral standards.
They legitimize
widespread social
and political
orders by
espousing and
spreading a
universal superhuman
order.
As societies
grow, they
need superhuman
authorities to
unite differences.
Religion does
this by pointing
to an absolute
and supreme
authority for
the laws needed
to control
society and
maintain social
stability.
While Islam,
Buddhism, and
Christianity are
universal and
missionary, the
vast majority of
ancient religions
were local and
exclusive and
therefore unable
to legitimize
widespread social
and political
orders such as
empires.
Universal and
missionary religions
first rose in the
first millennium B.C.
Prior to the
agricultural revolution,
humans had
animus beliefs,
meaning they
regarded all
beings, from
humans to
ghosts and from
tigers to
berries, as
equals.
The agricultural
revolution meant
humans could no
longer regard the
plants and animals
they farmed and
herded as equals,
but rather as
property.
To gain control,
humans gave their
full devotion to
superhuman powers in
the form of
sacrifices and
rituals in
exchange for
mastery over
plants and
animals.
With the rise of
polytheism and
gods, humans'
worldview shifted to
consider the
world as a
relationship between
gods and
humans.
Humans now
believed devotion
and bad deeds
controlled the
entire ecosystem.
When it rained,
how much wheat
grew, and how
many sheep
begot lambs.
Polytheist
religions believe
in a single
supreme power,
devoid of
interests and
biases, and
therefore unconcerned
with the desires
and worries of
humans.
Humans, who try
to unite these
ultimate unbiased
powers, equally
embrace the good
and the bad,
sickness and
health, poverty
and wealth, life
and death, with
the goal of
reaching a state
of enlightenment,
in which desires
and fears are
viewed as
pointless and
ephemeral.
Because polytheistic
religions have
plurality at their
core, they tend to
be more open-minded
and tolerant than
monotheistic
religions.
This is why, when
polytheists conquered
empires, Egyptians,
Romans, Aztecs, they
did not convert their
subjects.
Conquered people were
required to respect the
gods of the empire,
empire, because these
gods legitimized the
empire's power, but
they were still allowed
to freely worship
local gods and
observe local
rituals.
The only exception
was the Roman
intolerance of
Christian monotheism.
To respect Roman
gods was to respect
the political order.
When the Christians
denied Roman gods,
the Romans persecuted
them for being
politically subversive,
not because of their
religious choices.
In general,
monotheists are much
more fanatical and
missionary than
polytheists.
This makes sense,
because at the core
of monotheism is a
belief that believers
are in possession of
the entire message of
the one and only God,
and that they are
therefore responsible
for discrediting all
other religions and
beliefs.
For two thousand years,
monotheists have
asserted their authority
by attempting to wipe
out the competition.
The bloody battles
worked.
Today, the vast
majority of Earth's
human population
outside East Asia
is monotheistic.
Polytheism was the
precursor for both
monotheistic and
dualistic religions.
Dualistic religions
are centered on the
opposing forces of
good and evil.
They solve the
monotheistic problem
of, if there is a
God, how can there
be so much evil in
the world, but
struggle with the
problem of order
and common law
by failing to
explain who makes
the rules.
The most well-known
was that of
Zoroastrianism,
which originated in
Central Asia between
1500 and 1000 B.C.
Zoroastrianism had a
major influence on
nearly all religions
of the Middle East
and Central Asia
until Christianity
conquered Rome and
Islam dominated Persia.
Dualism did not
disappear completely,
but was instead
absorbed by the
major monotheistic
religions.
One only need to
think of the
Christian devil.
Similarly, monotheism
adopted some
polytheistic facets.
Christian saints are
the most obvious
example.
However, the devil
and saints do not
fit with the
definition of
monotheism, which
is the absolute
belief in a single,
all-encompassing,
and all-powerful
God.
Yet, such
dichotomies justify
violent acts, such
as the Crusades and
jihad, in the name
of asserting good
over evil.
In this way, today's
monotheism is actually
syncretism, a
combination of
monotheism, all-powerful
God, dualism, devil,
polytheism, saints, and
animism, ghosts.
Not all religions
are based on gods.
Deoism, Jainism, and
Stoicism believe the
superhuman order is a
product of natural
laws and does not
have any more
authority than
humans, animals, and
plants.
The most well-known
natural law religion
is Buddhism, which
does not center on a
god, but rather on a
human who said
suffering arises from
craving.
The major Buddhist
question is,
suffering exists, how
do I escape it?
In contrast, the
major monotheistic
question is, God
exists, what does
he want from me?
In the last 300
years, theist
religions have
declined as natural
law religions have
spread.
Such natural law
religions include
liberalism, communism,
capitalism, and
nationalism.
Although these
beliefs are more
often referred to as
ideologies rather than
religions, they are
in fact a system of
human norms and
values founded on a
belief in a superhuman
order.
No different from
Christianity or
Buddhism.
In the same way that
Islam has the Quran,
communism has Karl Marx's
Das Kapital as its
religious text.
And just as
Christianity celebrates
Christmas, the U.S.
celebrates Independence
Day.
And just as
Christianity and
Islam have fanatical
missionary religions,
so is capitalism, whose
followers believe the
whole world would
prosper if only all
nations and peoples
converted to their
ideology.
While theist religions
worship gods, humanist
religions worship
Homo sapiens.
Humanists believe humans
are unique, sacred, and
fundamentally different
from all other animals.
There are three main
tenets of humanism,
liberalism, socialism,
and evolutionary
humanism.
Liberalism says humanity
is individualistic, and
that the individual
freedom of each
individual human is
most important.
In contrast, socialism
believes humanity is
collective, and that
equality within and
among all humans is
most important.
Evolutionary humanism, such
as Nazism, believes the
human species can
degenerate into
subhumans or evolve
into superhumans, and
that it is the
responsibility of elites
to protect humankind
from degenerating into
subhumans.
Liberalism reigns in
today's world.
The liberal political
injustice system is based
on the Christian belief
that each individual has
a free and eternal soul.
Though liberalism is key
to modern political
systems, science proves
genes and hormones
control humans, not
free will.
Key Takeaways
A religion is a system
of human norms and
values founded on a
belief in a superhuman
order.
Gods are a product of
the agricultural revolution
and changed humans'
worldview from one in
which all humans and
animals are equal to a
relationship between
gods and humans.
The reason the majority
of the world's population
is monotheistic is
because people who
believe in one and only
God use violence and
war to justify
obliterating the
competition.
Natural law religions,
like liberalism and
capitalism, are rising as
theism is declining.
Liberalism, which is a
humanist religion that
worships humans, not
gods, is based on the
Christian belief that each
person has a free and
eternal soul.
Liberalism is the basis of
modern political and
justice systems.
Chapter 13 The Secret of
Success
History is chaotic and
unpredictable.
Just as the early Romans
never could have predicted
that an esoteric eastern
sect known as
Christianity would one day
become the Roman state
religion, let alone the
most popular religion
worldwide, we cannot know
if China will conquer the
United States 50 years from
now.
Events that seem
impossible often realize
themselves in the future.
History, like politics and
markets, is a level two
chaotic system, meaning it
reacts to predictions about
it and therefore its future
cannot be accurately
predicted.
This is why it is
important to study history.
History teaches the present
is neither predictable nor
natural, and therefore the
future cannot manifest in an
infinite number of possible
forms.
Because history is chaotic
and the future is
unpredictable, it is
impossible to determine whether
or not the well-being of
humans has improved
throughout history.
There is no proof that
Christianity was the better
choice over Manichaeism,
because there is no objective
way to observe or analyze the
benefit of one over the
other.
Cultures define what is good or
beneficial differently from one
another.
If all the people in a
particular culture alter their
worldview, then what is good for
humankind also changes.
The study of cultures is often
approached through the lens of
memetics, in which cultural
evolution is based on the
replication of cultural
information units called memes.
Memes are like parasites or
viruses.
Cultural ideas live inside a
host's mind, spread to other
hosts, and continue to live and
spread after the host dies.
This process happens without
regard to human life, and often
at the cost of human life.
Some scholars disagree with the
concept of memetics, and
instead look to theories of
postmodernism, in which
discourse spreads through
cultures without regard for
human life.
Another popular theory is
referred to as game theory, and
takes the position that all
players are harmed, and yet the
behavioral patterns and
cultural views spread.
Memetics, postmodernism, and
game theory all share the view
that history does not move in a
direction that benefits the
well-being of humans.
History is the same as
evolution, in that it moves
forward with no special
consideration of humans, and
especially not of human
happiness.
And like evolution, individual
humans are both too ignorant and
too weak to be able to influence
or direct history to their
advantage.
Key Takeaways
History is a level-two chaotic
system, meaning it reacts to
predictions about it.
Therefore, the future cannot be
accurately predicted and can pan out
in an infinite number of ways.
The well-being of humans has not
improved over history.
History is out of human control and
moves forward without consideration of
human life or human happiness.
Part 4.
The Scientific Revolution
Chapter 14.
The Discovery of Ignorance
There has been unprecedented growth in
the last 500 years.
In the year 1500, there were
approximately 500 million humans on
Earth.
Since then, the human population has
increased 14-fold to 7 billion.
In the last half-millennium, humans
have gone to the moon, developed
vaccines, and perhaps most importantly,
learned how to end all life with the
atomic bomb.
The Scientific Revolution is
responsible for these remarkable
feats.
This process in human history was a
revolution because prior to its
advent in the 16th century, humans did
not believe they could have such
medical, military, and economic
powers.
Rulers invested money in priests and
poets with the goal of maintaining, not
increasing, their capabilities.
When scientists brought forth evidence that
they could, in fact, expand human
capability, rulers started investing in
scientific research.
The result is a feedback loop in which
political and economic institutions
invest money in research, which leads to
increased power and further resources to
reinvest in more research.
Modern science differs from all other forms of
knowledge in three ways.
the willingness to admit ignorance, the
use of observations and mathematics to
connect observations into comprehensible
theories, and the use of theories to acquire new
powers, often in the form of technology.
The scientific revolution is best understood not as a revolution of
knowledge, but rather as a revolution of
ignorance.
The greatest discovery of the scientific
revolution is that humans do not know the answers to the most important
questions.
This is in great contrast to the previous knowledge
traditions, which, based on religions like Christianity and Buddhism, assert gods and
priests are all-knowing and have access to all necessary
information through scriptures.
The willingness to admit human ignorance has advanced science, but it has also
presented challenges to society.
If there are so many gaps and unknowns in the myths that are supposed to hold
society together, then how can societies, communities, and countries
cooperate effectively?
In order to stabilize society, socio-political orders must either declare a
scientific theory as absolute truth, in the case of the Nazis, who claimed racial
policies were based on biological fact, or reject science completely, as does liberal
humanism, which states all humans are unique individuals deserving of equal rights, even
though there is no scientific basis to prove this ideal.
While earlier traditions relied on stories to generate theories, modern science uses
mathematics.
Although some aspects of nature, such as physics, can be reduced to neat
mathematics, others, like psychology, biology, and economics, are more complicated.
The development of statistics made it possible for scientists to learn more about these
fields, and to be able to make accurate predictions about such things as economic growth and the
spread of disease.
Knowledge is power.
It is no good unless it translates to utility.
The connection between science and technology is fairly recent.
Prior to the modern era, uneducated craftsmen invented most technology.
Today, states rely on scientists to develop new technology.
Nowhere is this more evident than in the development of weapons and military technology.
The marriage of the military with technology is another recent phenomenon.
Until the nineteenth century, military revolutions were organizational, not technological.
It took the advent of both capitalism and the industrial revolution to unite science,
industry, and military.
The idea of progress did not enter the minds of humans until the scientific revolution.
Humans believed that if the all-powerful God, be it Jesus, Muhammad, or the Buddha, could
not solve the world's problems, then neither could humans.
In fact, such myths as the Tower of Babel, the story of Icarus, and the story of Gollum,
taught humans that any effort to go beyond human limitations were fruitless and a general waste
of time.
But when people started admitting their ignorance and recognizing science could reveal answers,
progress became possible.
Today, the greatest goal of the scientific revolution is to defeat death itself.
We've already made progress.
In the last two centuries, the average life expectancy has grown from between 25 and 40 years
to 67 years worldwide and 80 years in the developed world.
This is why death and the afterlife are no longer the central question for a number of ideologies
that dominate the world today.
Neither feminism nor communism is concerned with life after death.
The only modern ideology to consider death is nationalism, which promises those who die
in service of their nation will be absorbed into the collective memory of the nation and its people.
Science is shaped by economic, political, and religious interests.
Governments, individuals, and institutions fund scientific research because they have a
believe the discoveries they finance will ultimately help achieve a political, economic, or religious
goal.
Although scientists may be aware of the political, economic, or religious interests that dictate
the scientific agenda, without these forces, scientific research would likely come to a halt.
It is important to recognize that ideology sets the agenda for scientific research and ultimately
makes the decision of what to do with the research.
Imperialism, and capitalism in particular, have been the ideological engines behind scientific
research over the past 500 years.
Key Takeaways
The scientific revolution is dependent upon a system of mutual enforcement among science, politics,
and economics.
Politics, economics, and religion dictate the scientific agenda.
The scientific revolution is a revolution of ignorance, not knowledge.
It was only possible once humans admitted scriptures, priests, and gods could not explain all the world's
phenomena.
Humans did not think nor care about progress until the scientific revolution.
The rise of Europe is a recent phenomenon.
Prior to the 16th century, there were no major European empires.
Western Europe had nothing to offer besides slaves and minerals, and Northern Europe was so desolate
it was left alone.
Over the course of 250 years, Western Europe became the master of the outer world, defined as the
two American continents and the oceans.
The only reason Europe conquered this feat and not Asia was because the people of Asia had no interest
in conquering distant lands.
By 1775, Asia already controlled 80% of the world economy.
There was no need to look for power elsewhere.
The balance of power shifted once European powers conquered the outer world.
The change ushered in a new global order and global culture.
Today, humans around the globe view everything from dress to politics and from medicine to economics
through a European lens.
Europe achieved this feat through the military-industrial-scientific complex, or the development of military technology
and logistical advances in order to conquer foreign nations and peoples.
Europe, and later the United States, conquered, and not the Chinese and Ottomans, because the
Chinese and Ottomans in the 19th century organized their societies in ways that did not necessitate
modern science and capitalism the same way European societies did.
Modern science and technology flourished alongside European imperialism because both the plant-seeking
biologist and colony-seeking naval officer approached the world through ignorance.
Previous emperors believed they were all-knowing, and therefore, when they conquered new lands,
they spread their own views.
While Europeans certainly spread their worldview, they set out with the goal of acquiring new lands
and new knowledge.
The discovery of America kicked off the scientific revolution in Europe.
It taught Europeans to rely on present observations and not past traditions.
However, it took imperial ambitions for modern science to develop.
In order to conquer and control the new American lands, the Europeans needed to learn everything about
the geography, climate, language, culture, and history of the new lands.
The discovery of America prompted geographers to draw new maps with blank spaces.
More and more Europeans looked at the blank spaces as destinations to conquer.
From these ambitions, the first global empires and trade networks formed.
These long-distance conquests were extraordinary, yet entirely unnatural.
Throughout the majority of human history, societies were focused on local conflicts and never considered
conquering distant lands.
The Romans began by conquering neighboring Etruria, and 400 years later, conquered enough neighboring
lands to encroach upon Britain.
The Savavids of Persia, Mughals of India, and Ottomans of Turkey certainly heard about the
Europeans' conquest.
They were, however, uninterested and made no attempts to compete with the Europeans.
KEY TAKEAWAY
European imperialism grew from the ignorance of the scientific revolution and the newfound
desire to acquire new knowledge.
Imperialism is inextricably linked to scientific inquiry.
The only reason Asian empires like the Ottomans, Safavids, Mughals, and Chinese did not compete
with the Europeans was because they had no desire to conquer distant lands.
CHAPTER 16 THE CAPITALIST CREED
For the majority of human history, the economy remained around the same size.
But with the advent of the modern era around the year 1500, global production of goods and services
grew at unprecedented rates. The entire economic system, banking in particular,
is built on the trust in an imaginary future. Prior to the pre-modern era, money could only
represent and be converted into actual goods and services that existed in real time. This view
limited money's potential for growth. However, once people agreed that money could represent future
goods and services that did not exist in the present, economies were able to grow.
This new kind of money is what is known as credit. Credit assumes future resources will be more
plentiful than present resources. In summary, credit enables building in the present with future money.
Although credit had been used in cultures dating back to ancient Sumer prior to the modern era,
humans did not trust in the future enough to regularly use credit. This was because humans tended to believe
the past had been better than the present and that the future would likely only get worse. This meant
people believed the total amount of wealth was limited and maybe even decreasing. Credit,
therefore, did not make much sense and was seen as risky. Without credit, new businesses could not be
financed and the economy could not grow. With the scientific revolution came the concept of progress.
Progress is only possible when humans admit their ignorance and invest resources in research in order to improve.
Over the last 500 years, humans have become increasingly trusting in the future. This trust has translated into credit,
which results in real economic growth. Growth further increases trust in an even better future,
which fuels the cyclical cycle of credit and growth. Adam Smith, in the late 18th century,
was the first to theorize that capitalism, an economic system in which individual profits are reinvested
for increased production, could lead to fast economic growth. It worked and has grown outside
itself to become an ethic all of its own. Fewer than 250 years later, humans refer to capitalism as a creed for
how to behave and how to think. Capitalists believed economic growth is the supreme good and that happiness,
justice, and freedom are dependent upon economic growth. The religion of capitalism has also influenced
the direction of the scientific revolution. When increased profits and production are the goal,
the scientific enterprises that get funded are those that will lead to economic growth. However,
capitalism goes against all natural laws, which dictate growth cannot continue indefinitely.
Nevertheless, economies continue to grow. The credit market is dependent upon economic factors
that increase production as well as political events. Capitalists believe capital should be free
in order to influence politics, but that politics should not influence capital. They favor lower taxes
and few government regulations and believe markets should be allowed to take their natural course without
political interference. The free market doctrine is the most common and popular form of capitalism.
However, free markets entirely devoid of political bias or influence are impossible. Capitalism is not
possible without trust in the future, and the possibility of a future in which one can trust is
entirely dependent upon political systems. When governments fail to regulate the markets properly,
trust is lost, credit dwindles, and the economy falls into a depression. This is what happened in 2007
when the U.S. housing bubble burst.
Key Takeaways
The entire economic system, banking in particular, is built on trust in an imaginary future. Capitalism goes
against natural laws that state growth cannot continue indefinitely. Free markets are not possible without
some degree of political influence. Chapter 17. The Wheels of Industry
The majority of human history was dependent upon the growth cycles of plants and the changing cycles of
solar energy. This is because the most readily available source of power was human muscle, which depended upon
plants and converted to metabolic calories. The industrial revolution introduced a new method of energy
conversion, the steam engine. In just a few decades, the steam engine revolutionized the world, production
changed forever, and mass and efficient mobility was now possible. Thereafter, humans became obsessed with the idea
that machines could be used to convert one type of energy to another. This craze culminated with Einstein's
20th century discovery that any type of mass could be converted into energy and literally exploded when the
first atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima. Learning how to harness and convert energy solved the number one problem
of slow growth, scarcity of raw materials. The more humans learn about harnessing raw materials, such as sun or wind,
the more sources of energy become available. The more energy available, the more productive humans can be.
This is why the industrial revolution is a second agricultural revolution. Over the past 200 years, machines have all
but taken over agriculture. Even animals are mass produced in factories. Animals, like humans, are complex
creatures with psychological and emotional landscapes as rich and diverse as those of humans. Yet they are treated
as cogs in machines. Dairy cows, for example, live their entire lives standing in a small enclosure hooked up to
machines through which they are fed and milked. In this way, their mouths and udders are just two parts of an
industrial machine. Humans who produce and consume animals and animal products are just like slave owners
and traders who do not believe African men and women had the same emotional and social needs as white Europeans.
Like slavery, the exploitation of animals is driven by economics and only possible through willful ignorance.
In order for a capitalist society to survive, it must continually increase production. In order for
production to increase, people must buy goods and services. Therefore, capitalism is only possible with
consumerism. In stark contrast to the Puritans, Spartans, and other cultures that saw frugality as the
greatest good, consumerism values the consumption of goods and services as the highest virtue.
For the majority of human history, consumerism was viewed as selfish, decadent, and morally corrupt.
But with the use of popular psychology, consumerism has persuaded people to believe indulgence is good
and frugality is oppressive. Shopping has become a favorite pastime and consumer goods have become
essential mediators in relationships. Even religious festivals have come to be defined by shopping.
In contrast to religions in which humans consistently fail to live up to the ideal,
the religion of capitalist consumerists make it possible for its followers to do what they are asked to do.
Whereas Christians are told to overcome cravings and restrain selfish interests so they reach
paradise in the afterlife, capitalist consumerists are taught to make more money and buy more things
in order to obtain paradise in their current life. Key Takeaways
The Industrial Revolution is a revolution of energy conversion.
Increased energy sources lead to increased human productivity. The exploitation of animals is only
possible because humans are willfully ignorant of the complex social and emotional landscapes of animals.
A capitalist society thrives when production continually increases. Therefore, in capitalist societies,
consumption is viewed as the highest virtue. Chapter 18 A Permanent Revolution
The Industrial Revolution liberated humans from their surrounding ecosystems and forever changed the planet.
Although resources have increased, natural habitats have been devastated. Humans are no longer controlled by natural
forces, but are instead subjugated to the forces of industry and government.
The highest values in modern industry are precision and uniformity. In order to obtain these values,
industry requires timetables and assembly lines, both of which have become a template for nearly all human activity.
Public transportation was one of the most important
means of spreading the system of timetables. If a factory worker needed to be at work at 8 o'clock,
his train needed to arrive by 7.55. If the train was a few minutes late, the workers' productivity would be compromised.
In order to ensure workers arrived on time, the local times across cities needed to be made uniform.
From this need grew national time dictated by an artificial clock, rather than local time determined by the sun.
In addition to industrial time, the Industrial Revolution introduced urbanization, the disappearance of the peasantry,
the rise of the industrial proletariat, the empowerment of the common person, democratization,
youth culture, and the disintegration of patriarchy. Each of these changes in human behavior and activity
is dominated by an overarching theme of state and market as a replacement for family and local community.
For more than two million years, through both the agricultural and cognitive revolutions,
human societies were built upon strong bonds between families and small communities.
But within 200 years, the Industrial Revolution paved the way for the state and market to take over the functions of the family.
The family was traditionally the welfare, health, and education system, as well as the construction industry, trade union, and pension fund.
The family and local community provided insurance, information, and safety.
Each of these responsibilities was handled using local traditions and economies of favors.
A person's survival and success was a communal effort, and most human needs were taken care of by the family and the community.
The government had very little involvement with the daily affairs of families and communities.
The Industrial Revolution caused the powers to shift from the family to the market.
States and markets saw that by weakening the traditional bonds of family and community, they could gain unprecedented power.
Their biggest weapon in this effort was to introduce the concept of the individual.
The Industrial Revolution presented the idealized notion that you can marry whomever you want and choose whichever job suits you,
because even if your family rejects you, the state will be there with food, shelter, education, health, welfare, and employment.
The benefits of being an individual come at a cost.
Individuals often feel alienated and lament a lack of strong family ties.
This is good for the state because states and markets of alienated individuals can easily intervene in the lives of their members
without fear that the disenfranchised populace will band together and resist the state.
In just two centuries, the deal between states, markets, and individuals has overrun millions of years of evolution
that has made humans biologically designed to live and think as community members.
This is perhaps the most extreme example of how culture, as a system of myths and artificial instincts
that accustom humans to think and behave in certain ways from birth, works to override biology and evolution.
Imagined communities have been important for humans for millennia.
These imagined communities are composed of millions of strangers who share some sort of imagined bond
that enables them to imagine they know one another.
These imagined communities, like Islam or ancient China, are tailored to national and commercial needs
and seek to fulfill emotional needs of their members.
As small, intimate communities have decreased, imagined communities have become increasingly important.
They are now largely responsible for fulfilling the emotional vacuum that has been left with the exodus of the strong family unit.
The nation, the imagined community of the state, and the consumer tribe, the imagined community of the market,
are the two greatest imagined communities today.
Both consumerism and nationalism are imagined realities that enable millions of people to imagine other members
of their shared state or market have the same past as well as common interests and a common future.
These intersubjective realities, like money and human rights, only exist in the collective imagination.
Examples of consumer tribes are Manchester United fans and vegans.
Members of these consumer tribes define themselves by shopping activities.
Manchester United fans buy jerseys and match tickets.
Vegans donate to PETA and buy organic vegetables.
They are defined by what they consume.
These consumer tribes are often more important than the imagined communities of nations.
For example, a German vegan may prefer to marry a French vegan rather than a German carnivore.
Key Takeaways
The industrial revolution drastically changed human behavior and activity and replaced the family and
local community with the state and market.
In order to gain power, states enforce the notion of the individual.
The state reasons that even if your family does not support your decisions,
the state will provide for your basic needs.
Culture can be even more powerful than biology and evolution.
In the absence of the strong family unit, imagined communities fulfill emotional needs.
The nation and consumer tribe are the strongest imagined communities in the 21st century.
It is worth contemplating whether humans today are happier than their ancestors.
Have the exponential growth of the economy and development of limitless energy made humans
better off than their hunter-gatherer forefathers?
Have the violent 700 years since the cognitive revolution made an overall positive impact on the world?
It is hard to tell, and the answers are usually given as ideological prescriptions.
Nationalists say political self-determination is the source of happiness, while capitalists believe
material abundance and enterprising self-reliance are the answers to widespread happiness.
But what proof is there for these claims?
None. Historians have avoided the question of how the events and phenomenon they study,
from politics to gender, from economics to society, and from food to clothing, influence human happiness.
Though they may not have studied it, most historians have the same vague preconception about human happiness.
Many believe that since human capabilities, often used to alleviate miseries and fulfill aspirations,
have increased throughout history, humans are happier.
However, one must recognize new aptitudes, behaviors, and skills do not necessarily translate to happiness,
nor do they make life better.
Some argue there is a reverse correlation between human capabilities and happiness,
meaning the more capable a person is, the less happy she is.
Evidence for this theory includes the way power corrupts and the fact that modern life is unnatural
and often opposed to the needs and desires of our biology, which evolved for life as hunter-gatherers.
A more nuanced view says that until the scientific revolution, there was no clear correlation between power and happiness,
and in fact, medieval peasants were likely worse off than their prehistoric hunter-gatherers.
But in the last few centuries, in which humans have made strides in medicine and seen a decrease in violence,
life has become generally easier for humans.
And yet, these leaps in well-being are recent, only coming to fruition in the twentieth century.
While the last fifty years have been a golden age for humanity,
it is impossible to know if the world has undergone a fundamental shift or is basking in a short period of bliss.
In recent decades, scientists have taken on the challenge of scientifically determining what makes people happy.
Are the modern material factors of health, diet, and wealth more important than the hunter-gatherer values of community, religion, and a bond with nature?
The scientific definition of happiness is subjective well-being and can be further defined as something a person feels within herself
and manifests as a sense of immediate pleasure or long-term contentment.
One popular study found that money brings happiness, but only up to a point,
and beyond that, money has little impact on a person's well-being.
Another study found community and family have a greater impact on a person's happiness than do money and health.
Studies such as these lead some to conclude that a poor and disabled person surrounded by a devoted family and warm community
will be happier than an alienated billionaire.
Such research also raises the possibility that the great improvement in material conditions in the last 200 years
was offset by the collapse of the family.
If this is true, the average person today is no happier than his ancestors from the 1800s.
The most important finding from these and other happiness studies
is that happiness is dependent upon the correlation between objective conditions and subjective expectations,
not on objective conditions alone.
For example, if you want a Ferrari and get a second-hand fiat, you will feel deprived.
But if you want a fiat and get a fiat, you will feel content.
Of course, prophets, poets, and philosophers have been touting this creed for millennia,
but it is important to understand just how big of a role human expectation has played in the history of happiness.
If the science is true and happiness is determined by expectation,
then mass media and the advertising industry may be causing the world's happiness to plunge.
Biologists believe the mental and emotional worlds of humans are shaped by biochemical mechanisms
that have evolved over millions of years.
The biologist says a person's happiness is not determined by external parameters,
such as salary or political rights,
but rather by a complex system of nerves, neurons, and synapses.
What makes people happy are not material things like a new car or events like losing weight,
but instead pleasant sensations within the body.
Biology dictates happiness stays relatively constant.
We experience fleeting moments of pleasure, but ultimately the line stays the same.
However, each person's happiness barometer is set differently.
Some people are biochemically programmed to be generally happy,
regardless of living in an alienating city, losing all her money, or being diagnosed with diabetes.
Others are cursed with an unhappy biochemistry that causes the affected individual to be generally depressed,
despite having the support of a tight-knit community and winning the lottery.
For a person whose biochemistry is set to gloomy,
getting the perfect job and buying a dream house will only provide fleeting moments of pleasure
before his biochemistry resets to doom and gloom.
If we accept the biological approach to happiness, then history is of minor importance.
History can change external stimuli, but it does not influence biochemistry.
However, a person's happiness does not merely boil down to his biochemistry-dictated disposition.
Happiness is also affected by cognitive and ethical factors.
The greatest influence is whether or not a person views his or her life, in its entirety, as meaningful and worthwhile.
Nietzsche perhaps said it best,
If you have a why to live, you can bear almost any how.
Although people throughout the ages have experienced the same biochemical pains and pleasures,
their experiences varied greatly.
This means that medieval peasants may have been generally happier than modern secular people
because the peasants believed their lives would lead to eternal paradise,
whereas modern secular people feel confronted with the dreadful conclusion that their lives are meaningless.
Key Takeaways
Humans of the 21st century are likely no happier than humans at any other time in history.
Happiness is largely based on the correlation between expectations and objective reality.
According to biology, a person's happiness stays relatively constant
and only experiences momentary flutters of intense pleasure and blips of deep unpleasantness.
Happiness is also determined by how meaningful a person views his or her life to be.
Chapter 20
The End of Homo Sapiens
Humans evolved under the same biological boundaries,
subject to the same natural laws as any other living organism.
But now, humans are transcending the laws of natural selection
and replacing them with laws of intelligent design.
There is no way to predict how far experiments will go.
Some say the scientific revolution will morph into a biological revolution
in which life is ruled by biological engineering,
cyborg engineering, and the engineering of inorganic life.
Biological engineering is defined as deliberate human intervention on the biological level.
One example is castration,
castration, which is performed on bulls to create oxen,
or on young boys in previous eras in order to preserve high-pitched singing voices.
Now, scientists use genetic engineering to do such extraordinary things as create glow-in-the-dark rabbits.
Experiments in genetic engineering raise a host of ethical, political, and ideological questions.
Some fear genetic engineering will be used to create superhumans that will subjugate natural Homo sapiens
or that cloning will be used by bio-dictatorships to create droves of soldiers and obedient workers.
Genetic engineering is, nonetheless, all around us.
Bacteria have been genetically engineered to produce biofuel,
and fungi have been engineered to make insulin for diabetics.
Geneticists aim not only to transform living species, but also to revive extinct animals.
One Harvard scientist claimed that with adequate funding, $30 million,
he could reconstruct Neanderthal DNA and implant it into a human woman,
thereby designing the first Neanderthal birth in 30,000 years.
Of course, scientists both dream and fear the day when they can intervene in the human genome,
designing the abilities, needs, and desires of Homo sapiens.
There is no doubt scientists have the ability to produce superhumans.
What stops them from doing so are ethical and political objections.
However, it is unlikely these barriers will exist forever,
especially if continued research means prolonged human life and increased cognitive abilities.
Another major technology with widespread implications is cyborg engineering.
Cyborgs are beings made of both organic and inorganic parts.
In a way, most modern humans are in one way or another cyborgs
because most people supplement some natural functions,
be it with eyeglasses or bionic hands.
Computers and mobile phones can even be considered part of our cyborg makeup
because they relieve our brains of data storage and processing.
Some scientists are working on projects to directly link the brain to the internet and to other brains.
Others are working to convert thoughts into audible words to read minds.
It is impossible to know what implications such achievements could have on human memory,
consciousness, and identity.
The third major technology with the potential to change human life
is the engineering of fully inorganic beings.
Examples include computer programs that learn and evolve independently of their programmers.
The Human Brain Project, for example, aims to reconstruct a human brain inside a computer
that can talk and behave in the same exact way as any human brain.
If the project succeeds, will this brain be a person?
It's interesting to contemplate.
These and other technologies point to a future in which transformations occur
not only in technology and organization, but also in human consciousness and identity.
These changes may be so important that Homo sapiens become something else altogether.
When this will happen or what it will mean is impossible to know.
And because our desires and needs may be changed,
perhaps the greatest question humans should ask themselves is not
what do we want to become,
but what do we want to want?
Key Takeaways
Intelligent design may fundamentally alter what makes humans human.
