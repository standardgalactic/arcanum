Looked at from a distance, the success of the American Revolution in throwing off the yoke of British rule
must have seemed nearly miraculous.
So miraculous, in fact, that forever afterward, the leadership of the revolution,
George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, Benjamin Franklin,
they would all seem like demigods walking on water toward the promised land of American independence.
Looked at more closely, what stands out about the revolution is how much of its success was wrapped up in its failures.
As general-in-chief of the revolutionary army, Washington actually stumbled from one defeat to another.
From 1775 to 1780, his continental army was often on the point of mutiny and disintegration.
Even in victory, only his own personal example prevented his officers and men from attempting a coup d'etat
against their provisional and incompetent government, the Continental Congress.
Had the French not intervened, first with financial credits and supplies, and then with troops and ships,
it is entirely likely that the whole revolutionary affair would have gone up in smoke.
On the other hand, it was precisely the Continental Army's multiple failures
which robbed it of the confidence and prestige necessary to make a coup into a real threat.
The Continental Congress may not have liked the prospect of its army losing as often as it did,
but those losses kept it too feeble to gather the strength it needed to turn and destroy its creator.
There were other failures, however, which did not have such silver linings.
First, the independent-minded habits of the colonies, which had led them to buck against the tightening of imperial rule by Britain,
also led them to buck against each other.
Few of them had ever engaged, as colonies, in anything that looked like cooperation.
If anything, by maintaining agents in London to lobby for their interests,
the colonies had always seen themselves in competition with each other for imperial favors,
and that attitude died hard.
The Continental Congress had been called into being in 1774
to act as a common front for the colonies' grievances,
but its effectiveness at getting them to work together was small.
A number of the North American colonies, despite sharing those grievances,
refused to send any representatives at all to the Continental Congress.
This at first included Georgia, but also, and permanently,
included the French-speaking Canadian provinces and the West Indian Island colonies.
They would never have created a united government at all
if the French had not refused to deal with a revolutionary movement that had no central government.
And the government the revolutionaries did create,
by adopting the Articles of Confederation in 1781,
made the word united in United States sound hollow.
Even then, the representatives of the states in the Confederation Congress
frequently behaved as though Congress existed only for the promotion of their own interests.
Deliberately framed to make sure that the Confederation could never invade the sovereignty of the states
the way British imperial policy nearly had,
the Confederation Congress had no power to impose national taxes,
to create a unified currency,
or even to keep the states from passing trade legislation that beggared each other.
Another failure that was not so thick with silver lining
concerned the colonial loyalists.
Although Americans dearly prize the image of Washington's ragged Continentals
suffering nobly in the snows of Valley Forge,
almost as many Americans took up arms in defense of the crown,
either in regiments of loyalists organized by the British Army,
or in loyalist militias in the South.
And they, not Washington's Continentals,
were the big losers at the end of the revolution.
Their properties were confiscated,
their leaders banished,
and between 60 and 80,000 of them
actually left America entirely
to start their lives over again
in Canada, the West Indies, or Britain.
What this did in political terms
was to dump the infant beginnings
of an anglicized elite in America
out of its cradle
and open up political leadership
to what one unhappy Boston loyalist
described as
fellows who would have cleaned my shoes five years ago.
In New York,
the proportion of farmers sitting in the state legislature
rose from 25% before the revolution
to 42% afterwards.
In Massachusetts,
the percentage rose to 47%.
In Georgia,
voting rights were open to all taxpayers,
not just,
as had been the case everywhere in the colonies
before 1776,
those who owned certain levels of property.
Americans,
who had formerly based their claims
to leadership on wealth or status,
now either left America entirely
or changed their tunes
and preferred to emphasize
how humble their birth had been.
A prime case of which was
Benjamin Franklin,
who, as we saw in the last lecture,
was a social climber
and intellectual climber
par excellence.
Franklin had been a loyalist
right up until 1775,
and at that point,
he prudently switched sides
to join the revolutionaries
and afterward composed
an autobiography
that relentlessly reminded his readers
that he was, after all,
a self-made man.
College education
in the new United States
also ceased to be
the private preserve of gentlemen.
And between 1776 and 1800,
16 new colleges were founded
to exhibit to the world
the perfection
which the mind of man
is capable of receiving
from the combined operation
of liberty, learning,
and the gospel upon it.
Well, this satisfied
the rank and file
who had fought for the revolution
and who only thought it fair
that they should now claim
the power to govern.
But it also meant
that power now fell
into the hands of people
who had precious
little experience
at using it,
and with even less experience
beyond their own
narrow cultural
or political boundaries.
And that, in turn,
was about to launch
a surprise
for those revolutionaries
who had supposed,
on the basis
of Whig political theory
and the example
of classical republicanism,
that once the rubbish
of corrupt imperial rule
had been swept aside,
a natural,
and they meant natural
in the enlightenment
sense of the word,
as something which reflected
the true realities
that sensation
communicates to the mind,
they believed that virtue
and virtuous leadership
and nature
and natural leadership
would step into place
and rule the new republic
as the ancient Roman republic
had been ruled
by its noble
and virtuous Senate.
And that, of course,
was not what happened.
The restless
new state legislatures,
complained New Jersey
Governor William Livingston,
do not exhibit
the virtue
that is necessary
to support
a republican government.
Indeed, they did not.
They reeked of trade.
They recklessly issued
unsecured paper money,
which they used
to pay off their debts.
They stripped churches
of public tax support.
They even took over
the powers
which had once belonged
to governors and judges
for themselves.
And these legislators
quarreled remorselessly
with each other
and within themselves.
Meanwhile,
on the fringes
of the new republic
hung the British in Canada
and the Spanish
across the Mississippi.
As a protest
over the treatment
of the loyalists,
the British refused
to send diplomatic
representatives
to the Confederation.
And they privately
financed the Indians
of the Northwest
to raid American settlements
along the frontier.
The Spanish
closed the Mississippi River
to American trade
in an effort
to strong-arm
the frontier counties
of Kentucky
and Tennessee
to submit
to Spanish rule.
If the Confederation
and the state legislatures
insisted on their
unsteady habit
of self-inflicted
political wounds,
then the whole notion
of an American republic
might fall in on itself.
And that,
in turn,
would be a setback
of colossal proportion,
not only for the idea
of Whig republicanism,
but for the Enlightenment's
fundamental notions
about human nature.
Perhaps the great problem
here was not
that the republican ideology
had been overconfident
about the possibilities
of success in America,
but that the wrong version
of republicanism
had held the upper hand
ideologically
for so long.
Now,
all English-speaking
Whig
republicans
in the 18th century
shared
certain
Whig essentials.
First of all,
they repudiated
tradition,
hereditary monarchy,
and aristocracy
as unnatural
and unreasonable.
Also,
they were all
suspicious of power,
seeing power
as the enemy
of liberty.
Third,
all of these
Whig republicans
believed fervently
in the supremacy
of reason
and in the realm
of politics,
the chief job
of reason
was the discernment
of natural law.
In some cases,
like the deists,
natural law
was almost
a replacement
for religion.
And not only
natural law,
but the pursuit
of natural rights.
Natural rights
which they held
to be fundamental
and universal
for all of humanity.
And then,
lastly,
all of these
Whig republicans
found their
chief inspiration
in the example
of republican Rome.
What divided them,
however,
was the split
in republican thinking
between classical
and liberal republicans.
And although
that split
was neither so wide
or so absolute
as it has
sometimes been portrayed,
it at least
represented
a profound
difference of attitude
between
American republicans.
And we can understand
how this worked out
in practical terms
after the revolution
by considering
the position
of three
of those
American republicans.
Thomas Jefferson,
Alexander Hamilton,
and James Madison.
Jefferson can,
I think with
some justice,
be described
very much
as a
classical
republican.
For Jefferson,
the necessary
glue
of a republican
society
was
virtue.
And virtue
was bound up
as it had been
for the English
Whigs of the 1690s
with the ownership
of land.
Land
represented
real
wealth.
Land
was the place
where work
and soil
combined
to produce
tangible prosperity.
And the discipline
required
to create
that prosperity,
to work
that land,
was itself
the best
reinforcement
of virtue.
Those who
labor in the
earth
are the
chosen people
of God
if ever he
had a chosen
people,
Jefferson wrote
in the 1780s.
On whose breasts,
or rather,
in whose breasts
he has made
his peculiar
deposit
for substantial
and genuine
virtue.
Well,
protecting
the independence
of landowners,
of those
who labor
in the earth,
was consequently
paramount
to Jefferson.
Because
dependence
produces
subservience
and venality,
suffocates
the germ
of virtue,
and prepares
fit tools
for the designs
of ambition.
only those
who owned
land,
only those
who worked
land,
could really
escape the
bonds of
dependence,
could only be
genuinely
independent.
Now,
this lethal
dependence
could take
one of two
forms.
It could come
as it had
in 1776,
from a corrupt
government,
which levied
taxes on
virtuous farmers,
and by levying
those taxes,
forced the
farmers into
debt.
Debt was
subservience.
Debt
implied
dependence.
Or,
dependence
could come
from a corrupt
elite,
who tempted
the virtuous
farmers to
spend themselves
into debt
in order to
buy luxuries.
Or it could
come from an
unholy alliance
of both,
to shift the
center of the
republic's economy
into manufacturing
baubles,
thereby drawing
farmers off the
land and into
the cities,
and reducing
them to cash
grubbing wage
earners who
would be just as
subservient to
their employers
as oppressed
taxpayers were to
corrupt officials.
Commerce and
manufacturing,
in Jefferson's
mind,
dealt in
treason,
stratagems,
and spoils.
It dealt in
illusory forms
of wealth.
Not land,
but loans,
interest,
mortgages,
bills of credit,
stock,
cash,
all of them
phony
and insubstantial.
Mere empty
signs of wealth
rather than the
real thing,
which was
land.
So,
said Jefferson,
while we have
land to labor,
then let us
never wish to
see our citizens
occupied at a
workbench or
twirling a
distaff.
For those kinds
of manufactured
goods,
let Americans
exchange their
agricultural abundance
with Europe.
And whatever is
lost by the
balance of trade,
well,
that will be made
up in happiness
and permanence
of government.
And let cities
be merely the
depots for those
agricultural goods
rather than seeing
cities turn into
manufacturing ant
hills where
wage laborers
basely and
supinely do as
their moneyed
masters tell
them.
The mobs of
great cities,
said Jefferson,
add just so much
to the support of
pure government
as sores due
to the strength
of the human
body.
When we get
piled upon one
another in large
cities as in
Europe, we
should become
corrupt as in
Europe and go
to eating one
another as they
do there.
However,
this agricultural
paradise of
Jefferson's had a
dark side.
And it was this
dark side which
bothered Alexander
Hamilton.
Since a nation
of landowning
yeoman might
very well make
for independence
but it also
might very well
make for
stagnation.
And what
Alexander
Hamilton wanted
most from
life was not
stagnation but
mobility.
Born in 1755
on the West
Indian island of
Nevis,
Hamilton was the
illegitimate son
of a ne'er-do-well
Scot who abandoned
the boy and his
mother when
Hamilton was ten
years of age.
At age 13 he
was apprenticed as
a clerk to the
merchant firm of
Beckham and
Kruger on St.
Croix.
And young
Hamilton's quickness
and vividness of
wit made so
great an impression
on a local
Presbyterian
missionary, Hugh
Knox, that Knox
raised the funds
needed to send the
boy to New York
City for an
education where
Hamilton entered
King's College,
now of course
Columbia University,
as a special
student in 1773.
Hamilton took
the lead in
student protests
against Britain
in 1775 and
was commissioned
in 1776 as
captain of an
artillery company.
He saw action
at one humiliating
continental defeat
after another and
suffered with the
army through one
humiliating delay
in supply after
another caused
by the quarreling
among the states
in the Continental
Congress.
He ended the
war as one of
George Washington's
aides and was
permitted to
practice law in
New York in
1782.
The war taught
Hamilton a number
of lessons, the
first of which was
not to put too
much trust in the
virtue of the
people.
It is not safe to
trust to the virtue
of any people,
Hamilton discovered,
since the same
stock of passions,
which generates a
hatred of tyranny
and oppression, can
just as easily lead
people to a
contempt and
disregard of all
authority.
It was not
virtue, said
Hamilton, but
power that
motivates people.
Men always love
power, Hamilton
wrote.
And while that
might not be
ideal, and in
fact, while that
might not be a
compliment to
Republicans,
nevertheless,
Hamilton observed
that was what
motivated people.
So the question
in a republic was
not about identifying
and protecting
virtue, or about
identifying and
protecting that
pastime, or that
livelihood, which
would automatically
promote virtue, but
rather about
identifying and
blunting power.
Unlike Jefferson,
Hamilton inherited
no wealth and no
land.
Quite the opposite.
his rise to fame
had begun in
commerce as a
clerk, and
continued that way
as a New York
City lawyer.
And not
surprisingly, he
dismissed the
classical
Republicans'
paranoia about
commerce and
cities and
manufacturing out
of hand.
The prosperity of
commerce, Hamilton
said, is now
perceived and
acknowledged to be
the most useful,
as well as the
most productive
source of national
wealth.
And Hamilton
pooh-poohed the
fears of Jefferson
as seeing ghosts
from bedsheets.
The often agitated
question, said
Hamilton, between
agriculture and
commerce has, from
indubitable experience,
received a decision
which has silenced
the rivalships.
The decision of
experience has proven
to the satisfaction of
their friends that
their interests, the
interests of
agriculture and
commerce, are
intimately blended and
interwoven.
So what if
commerce did not
produce or
require virtue?
Let's face it,
Hamilton said,
neither really did
agriculture.
So the solution was
not to be found in
suppressing one or
the other, but in
harnessing them both
to become a great
national team.
The trick, of course,
was in the
harnessing, because
that implied a
harnesser.
And the one thing
which was clear the
confederation government
was incapable of
doing was harnessing
together anything.
On the other hand,
a government strong
enough to harness
together agriculture
and commerce appalled
the Jeffersonians.
Since that not only
meant putting
agriculture and
the cheating
swindle of cash
on the same
plane, but it
would require
precisely the
kind and level
of taxes which
would enslave
the virtuous
farmer.
However, to
Hamilton, the
mechanic and
manufacturing arts
furnish the
materials of
mercantile
enterprise and
industry.
And that, in
turn, would arm
the American
Republic as a
whole with the
kind of economic
power which
would permit it
to resist the
encroachments of
the English or
the Spanish.
For that reason,
Hamilton belongs
pretty firmly in
the liberal
Republican column.
And also for
that reason,
Jefferson and
Hamilton became
the yin and
yang of the
revolutionary
generation.
Between them
stood James
Madison.
Born like
Jefferson,
to the landed
Virginia gentry
in 1751,
Madison graduated
from Princeton
in 1771.
Frail in health
and embarrassingly
underage in
appearance,
military service
in the revolution
was out of the
question for
Madison.
But he did
serve in the
Virginia legislature
and from 1780
to 1783 in
the Continental
Congress.
Most of his
early efforts were
aimed at guarding
Virginia's state
interests.
And he always
remained uneasy
at the prospect
of a powerful
national government.
His hope was
for a government
of classical
Republican virtue.
And he was
frank about his
desire for a
constitution whose
first aim would be
to obtain for
rulers men who
possess most wisdom
to discern and most
virtue to pursue
the common good
of society.
But Madison
had learned enough
at the hands of his
Calvinist mentors
at Presbyterian
Princeton.
He had learned not
to put too much
trust in the
spontaneous appearance
of virtue in
politics.
If men were
angels,
Madison remarked,
no government
would be necessary.
But men were
not angels,
even if they
were farmers.
And next,
in importance to
recruiting the
virtuous to
serve as rulers,
a constitution
was needed to
take the most
effectual precautions
for keeping
them virtuous
whilst they
continue to
hold their
public trust.
There is,
Madison admitted,
a degree of
depravity in
mankind which
requires a
certain degree
of circumspection
and distrust.
And nowhere
was the need
for that distrust
more evidently
on display
than in
the Confederation
Congress,
where the states
cheerfully obstructed
the levying
of even the most
modest import
duties and
defeated treaties
with foreign
powers on
little more
than whim.
Without being
a liberal
Republican at
heart,
Madison had
a liberal
Republican's
head.
And that
head told him
in the 1780s
that something
drastic needed
to be done
about the
Articles of
Confederation
or else the
American Union
would dissolve
and it wouldn't
matter how
virtuous American
farmers might
actually be.
Madison and
Hamilton got
their chance
in 1786
when a convention
called
at Annapolis
to settle
disputes over
river rights
between Virginia
and Maryland
broke down
and forced
the commissioners
including
Madison and
Hamilton
to blame
the breakdown
on the Articles
of Confederation
and to call
for a convention
of the states
to rewrite them.
The convention
however,
when it met
in Philadelphia
in May of 1787
took the bit
in its teeth
and instead
of rewriting
the Articles
junked them
completely
in favor of
writing an
entirely new
Constitution
that transformed
the Articles
awkward league
of independent
states
into a
federalized
union.
The Constitution
of 1787
is a remarkable
political document
for many
reasons.
Although like
the revolution
which made
it possible
some of its
most important
accomplishments
were the ones
it did not
make.
The most
important issue
at stake
was,
after the
Annapolis
convention,
establishing
a strong
workable union
that could
arbitrate
state conflicts
and give a
sense of
united national
identity to
the republic.
What was
noticeably
absent,
however,
was any
appeal
in the document
to the
classical
republican
appeals
to
virtue.
Instead,
the Constitution
of 1787
was a document
filled with
a series
of extremely
skeptical
compromises
whose chief
purpose was
plainly to
deal with the
effects of
power,
not to offer
sermons
on virtue,
but rather
to create
mechanisms
that would
play one
kind of
power in
the new
republic
off against
another.
The government,
for instance,
was divided
into three
branches,
executive,
legislative,
and judicial,
each of
which was
set to
watchdog
the other.
Within the
legislative branch,
power was
divided between
a House of
Representatives,
elected by
the people,
and a Senate
chosen by the
state legislatures,
while the
chief executive
officer, the
president, was
elected through
a two-stage
process, first
by a general
election, and
then by an
electoral college.
As Madison
explained, liberty
was best served
by contriving
the interior
structure of the
government so
that its several
constituent parts
may, by their
mutual relations,
be the means of
keeping each
other in their
proper places.
so where
virtue might
fail to
make people
cooperate,
self-interest
would not.
And so if
the self-interests
of the various
parts, not
only of the
government, but
of the republic
as a whole,
were set
carefully off
against each
other, then
the energy
that each
interest, devoted
to promoting
itself, would
prevent any
single one of
them from
obtaining control
over the
others.
There was
an echo
of this in
the Constitution's
provisions for
the economic
life of the
republic.
Or, rather,
the absence,
the almost
complete absence
of any
provisions for
regulating the
economic life
of the
republic.
Because the
new Constitution
did not, in
fact, articulate
any economic
policies or
preferences.
It merely
reserved to the
new federal
legislature, the
Congress, the
power to regulate
commerce with
foreign nations,
levy taxes and
tariffs, pass
bankruptcy laws, and
borrow money.
More important, it
clearly restrained
the states from
establishing their
own economic
policies.
Article 1,
Section 10 of
the Constitution
barred the
states from
issuing their
own money or
levying tariffs on
imports or
exports.
So far, in
fact, was the
Constitution, from
prescribing any
particular form of
public virtue, that
it managed not only
to say nothing about
how the economy
should be built, it
managed to avoid even
making any reference
to God or to
Christianity, unlike
Jefferson's
declaration.
And if Jefferson
had been a member of
the Philadelphia
Convention, he, quite
conceivably, could have
made a great deal of
grief for Hamilton and
Madison on all of
these points.
But Jefferson was not
there.
Jefferson was serving as
American minister to
France.
And Hamilton and
Madison both mounted an
effective media campaign
on behalf of the new
Constitution through a
series of 85 brief
articles they serialized in
the New York Papers, and
which was subsequently
known as the
Federalist Papers.
And by June of 1788,
the Constitution had
been ratified by the
necessary number of
states and become the
new law of the land.
When Madison finally
wrote to Jefferson in
October of 1787 to
describe the new
Constitution, Jefferson
was predictably
unenthusiastic.
I like much the
general idea, Jefferson
replied in December, but
the truth was that he
was not a friend to a
very energetic
government.
Well, energetic
government was
precisely what he was
now to witness in
action.
Thank you.
