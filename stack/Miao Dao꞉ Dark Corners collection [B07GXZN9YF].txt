One.
Hey there, boobs.
Like hyenas, they laugh.
Soon after her 13th birthday, brushing against her in the school halls, on staircases, and in the cafeteria as soon as she stepped inside.
At first, Mia thought it had to be an accident.
Accidents.
Not boys in her grade, which was 8th grade, but older boys.
Taller boys.
Boys whose names she didn't know.
Whose faces were not familiar to her.
Hi there, boobs.
How's it going?
In her confusion and embarrassment, Mia had no idea what the boys were saying.
She was too surprised at first to comprehend that they were brushing against her, colliding with her on purpose.
And there was the juvenile hyena laughter, sniggering and breathless.
Look at her.
Boobs.
Where are you going so fast?
Turning an astonished face upon them, and her tormentor's word delighted.
Betraying a glimmer of hurt, fear, embarrassment, mortification, and they only brayed louder.
One of them, the oldest, the tallest, dared to elbow Mia in the softest part of her chest, so that Mia cried out in pain, and the surprise of pain.
Excuse me, boobs.
Ninth grade boys whose names Mia didn't know, running through the 8th grade corridor, colliding with others and laughing uproariously as they fled.
Mia stood hunched against a row of lockers, stunned.
Her heart beat rapidly.
She could not comprehend what had happened so quickly.
Her chest, her small, tender breasts, ached where she'd been bumped.
Why were the boys singling out her?
Could they see in her face that her father had ceased to love her?
Went away cringing, eyes downcast.
She didn't cry, not the first time.
Too embarrassed to report the boys, too ashamed.
Mia reasoned, it will only make them hate me worse.
For there seemed a kind of anger in their faces as they swooped upon her.
They must have been lying in wait.
They must have known where Mia would be.
There was laughter and jeering, but something else Mia could not comprehend.
Resentment.
Anger.
But why?
Why anger at her?
And always, it happened so quickly.
Once, twice, three times in a single week.
The boys appeared out of nowhere, hooting with laughter, bumped against Mia, and were gone.
Other students, with whom they collided in their haste to escape, shouted after them.
At least one teacher noticed, but did not intervene.
Mia went away dazed each time.
She learned the name, the last name, of the loudest boy.
Dempster.
She remembered how other girls had been subjected to this sort of torment from boys like Dempster
in the past, and she tried not to notice.
Girls who slunk away self-consciously as a small gang of boys teased, jeered, laughed at
them, dared to brush against them or jostle them, while younger girls like Mia avoided even
looking at them, hoping to be spared.
And of course, they were spared.
At the time, that fierce, sidelong look the boys cast at certain girls, the more mature
girls, Mia was slow to realize that the same thing was happening to her now.
Often now, other girls avoided Mia.
Not her closest friends, but others.
Even her friend Janie seemed embarrassed for Mia, but made it a point to walk with Mia between
classes and into the cafeteria.
As one might accompany a very young, naive child, as if to protect her.
Not that Janie could protect Mia much, if the boys ganged up on her.
Janie herself was jostled roughly, jeered at.
After one of the assaults, when the boys emerged out of nowhere to collide with Mia, laughing at
her, chorting, chortling, boobs, as they ran away.
Mia sobbed to Janie.
I hate them.
What are they saying?
Boobs?
Reluctantly, Janie whispered in Mia's ear.
Boobs.
Of course, she'd known.
Should have known.
No more embarrassing word than boobs.
Mia felt her face heat with shame, just to think of it.
Boys often swore, said nasty things.
Fuck, shit, were frequent.
Asshole was frequent.
But boobs was a different sort of word.
Not a swear word.
Not obscene.
More of a comical word.
To make people laugh.
Hey there.
Boobs.
Yeah.
You.
Mia could not remember when she'd first learned of the wild kitties in the vacant lot
beside their house.
Possibly, she'd heard someone speaking of them.
Wild kitties who don't have homes.
Later, Mia would hear the more precise term.
Feral cats.
A colony of feral cats living in the dense underbrush on land no one seemed to own.
Called a cul-de-sac.
In the beginning, not many feral cats had lived in the cul-de-sac.
Eventually, their numbers increased.
It had become Mia's secret in the past year.
Stopping to visit the feral cats on her way home from school.
For her father disapproved of the cats.
And was particularly incensed that several persons in the neighborhood fed them regularly.
To him, they were dirty strays.
Diseased.
At risk for rabies.
Someone should call animal control.
Have them trapped and euthanized.
The word euthanize was chilling to Mia.
When she'd first heard it, she had not known what it meant.
And so asked her mother, but mispronounced the word.
Youth in eyes.
Oh, Mia.
I think you mean euthanize.
Her mother laughed at Mia.
Not meanly, but in a way to make Mia blush and want to run out of the room.
For years afterward, having to endure both her parents telling their friends how as a little girl,
Mia had mistaken euthanize for youth in eyes.
And wasn't that hilarious?
No, Mia thought.
Not funny at all.
And now, in the years since her father had left the house, left the family,
Mia was certainly old enough to know what euthanize meant.
Fancy term for murder.
Her father had objected to strays, trespassing on his property.
Even when the cats were, as Mia could see, very beautiful.
Sleek black, taffy colored, white with multiple markings.
Brindle cats, steel gray cats.
A thick furred orange tiger with a wonderful crooked plume of a tail.
Except, when you saw the cats close up, they were not usually so beautiful.
Their eyes were likely to be sticky with mucus.
Their fur matted and mangy.
Their bodies so thin that the impressive ribs showed through their fur.
Seen at close range, the orange tiger that looked so fierce from Mia's bedroom window
had bitten ears and one blind eye.
Oh, poor kitty.
In secret, Mia put out food for these cats at the back door of her house.
But the food was soon gobbled up by squirrels.
The feral cats were solitary hunters.
Sometimes Mia would glimpse one behind the house, nearly hidden in the dusk.
How slowly it moved.
Crouching, tensed, about to spring.
Scarcely breathing.
Mia would watch.
If she were a huntress, Mia thought, that was how she would move through the grass.
Yet, in the next moment, for no reason Mia could determine, the feral cat might bolt away,
disappear.
Calling, kitty, kitty, kitty, in a friendly voice made no difference.
The feral cats did not trust human beings, and so did not trust Mia.
If she were a huntress, Mia thought, that was how she would move through the grass.
Their backyard bordered the empty lot, and so feral cats often crossed warily through the property
on their way from and to the lot.
Mia would hear her father yelling at the cats,
dirty vermin, get the hell out of here.
It was not like Mia's father to be so excitable, usually.
Some terrible change had begun already back then.
Though Mia, one of the smartest and most perceptive students in her grade,
had somehow failed to perceive it.
Unless she'd perceived, but chosen not to acknowledge.
Just as she had perceived, yet failed to notice,
that Daddy had moved his things from the big upstairs bedroom
into the guest room at the rear of the house,
with its own door leading outside.
So that when her mother had told her the news,
that her father, who'd been away for twelve days,
traveling on business, she'd been told,
was moving permanently out of the house,
it was both like a crazed bat careening at her face,
something she couldn't duck in time,
and also like something she'd always known,
should have figured out.
As carefully, her mother said,
It has nothing to do with you, Mia.
Pausing then, drawing a shaky breath.
For Mama had been locked away in the bedroom much of the day,
while Mia was in school.
All that rainy afternoon locked away,
drinking dark wine that stained her teeth
and turned her breath sweet,
and now her words were slurred.
Mia had to lean forward to hear,
while trying not,
trying so hard not,
not to smell Mama's breath.
Repeating,
Nothing at all to do with you.
So that Mia thought,
Nothing.
Me.
Returning home one evening,
turning into the driveway,
in the time before he left,
Mia's father had been driving.
Mia's mother was in the passenger seat,
and Mia and the boys,
Randy and Kevin,
were in the bag.
Suddenly, her father accelerated,
as a blurred white shape,
slunk in front of the car.
Everyone,
except Daddy,
cried,
No, don't!
There came a muted thud,
an ear-piercing caterwaul.
But when Mia and her mother
searched for the creature,
they failed to find it.
Nor were there bloodstains
on the driveway,
or in the grass.
In the shrubbery beside the house,
in the backyard,
in a wooded area
beside their property,
no animal.
Mia's father insisted
that he'd only intended to
scare the goddamn thing,
hadn't hid it.
But Mia didn't believe him,
and went away weeping.
Crawled off to die,
all alone.
Boobs.
Wanting to text Janie,
so lonely,
just to say,
she wasn't sure.
Hate them.
Wish they were dead.
Where were you after school?
But Mia knew,
since sixth grade,
she couldn't exactly
trust Janie
not to share texts
or emails
with other friends.
And lately,
she sensed
how they talked about her,
felt sorry for her,
but maybe
laughed at her
behind her back.
Boobs.
But hadn't she perceived?
For months
before he'd moved
out of the house,
and everything in Mia's life
had started to feel
like walking on a floor
that begins to shift
and slide,
Mia had begun
to notice
that her father
was often distracted,
restless.
No sooner returning home
than he had to make
an urgent phone call.
Couldn't sit down
for dinner just then.
He complained of clutter
in the home,
but objected to Mia's mother
disturbing my things
where he'd flung them down.
Especially,
he disliked items
out of place
in the kitchen.
He could detect
if one of his Japanese knives
was just slightly askew,
for this might mean
that someone had been using it
who had no idea
how it should be used,
thus endangering
the razor-sharp blade.
Has someone been fooling
with my knives?
The question struck fear
in the hearts
of the children.
Though certainly,
none of the children
had touched
their father's
expensive Japanese knives.
Had Mama?
If so,
Mama wouldn't have failed
to return the knife
to its proper place
on the magnetized rod.
Mia did not like
to look at the dazzling knives.
The razor-sharpness
seemed to hurt her eyes.
But there was comfort
in the beautifully carved
ebony handles.
All that Mia had dared,
with no one to witness,
was to close her hand
around one of the knife handles
without removing it
from the magnetic rod.
A strange sensation.
The carved ebony
felt warm,
as if another person
had just been holding it.
When Mia's father
had returned
for the rest of his possessions,
he was furious
to discover
one of the expensive knives
missing.
He'd accused Mia's mother
of misplacing it,
and Mia's mother
had protested,
saying that he'd probably
misplaced it himself.
So Mia's father
had gone away,
for the last time,
in a mood of bitterness
and animosity.
When Mia had returned
from school that day,
last year,
this was the first thing
she'd noticed.
The glittering Japanese knives
gone from the kitchen.
where they'd hung,
now a terrible emptiness.
It was Mia's secret
from her mother, too,
visiting the feral cat colony,
for Mama would not
have approved.
Often now,
Mama was in an irritable mood,
on the phone,
sobbing,
or suddenly angry,
slamming the receiver
onto the hook,
scolding Mia's brothers
who bickered,
left their toys underfoot,
turned the TV up too high,
glaring at Mia,
who returned from school
suspiciously late.
Where the hell have you been?
Hanging out with...
who?
Mia's little brothers
were frightened.
Mama shouted at them,
which she had not
ever done before,
and told them,
go away,
you're giving me a headache.
Mia knew to keep her distance
from their angry mother.
Overhearing Mama
on the phone,
so distracted
and exhausted
by that bastard's lies,
can't sleep
without sleeping pills,
and can't get through the day
without antidepressants,
sometimes I think
I just...
want...
to...
die...
Mia was becoming
stealthy,
cunning.
She brought the cat's
water and food
from the refrigerator
her mother wasn't
likely to miss.
One day,
daring to take
lamb chops
from the freezer
originally purchased
for her father
and left behind
in a lower drawer
to leave on the ground
to defrost.
When she returned
from school
hours later,
the meat
was entirely gone.
Not even bones
remained.
Several cats
peered at Mia
suspiciously.
The more she looked,
the more cats
she saw,
all poised
to flee back
into the underbrush
if she made
a sudden move.
Kitties?
Don't be afraid.
I'm your friend.
Hiding behind
a fallen tree limb,
camouflaged
by desiccated leaves,
was the tiger cat
with a clouded eye,
bitten ears.
His sand-colored fur
was matted
and tufted.
Why would we trust you?
We don't trust you.
Suddenly she saw,
only a few feet away,
a skinny black cat
crouching in the grass
with amber eyes
of startling beauty
staring at her with,
it seemed,
a look of hope.
Until Mia made a move
as if to pet it
and the black cat
shrank away
baring its teeth.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I wasn't going
to hurt you.
But the skinny black cat
was gone.
The others were gone
in a heartbeat.
The cul-de-sac
was becoming a place
where people dumped things.
Amid the underbrush
and debris
were old rotted newspapers,
cardboard boxes
filled with trash,
broken bits of styrofoam
and plastic.
It seemed sad to Mia
that the feral cats
had to make their home
in such a place
with little protection
from cold weather,
rain,
and snow.
Wish I could bring you
home with me.
All of you.
At least now that
Mia's father was gone,
the cats would be safer.
Mia tried to take comfort
in this.
Mia,
let me look at you,
sweetie,
stand still.
That concerned smile,
assessing eyes.
Mia's mother would not dare
touch her,
would she not actually
bring the flat of her hand
lightly against Mia's chest?
No.
Wouldn't dare.
Mia steeled herself.
Do not touch me.
Her mother was surprised,
it seemed,
as if these past several months,
the past year,
in fact,
she hadn't been noticing Mia.
Too much else in her life now
as a single,
divorced mom
to distract her,
distress her.
Dating sites?
Was she actually?
Mia cringed to think so.
Most of her mother's attention
was channeled into fury,
like a laser beam.
That son of a bitch,
that bastard,
I trusted him,
and he lied.
Lied.
About money,
about the property,
about this girl
he's been seeing.
Matter-of-factly saying,
with not a clue
of how stiff,
how still Mia
was holding herself.
Next thing we know,
you'll have to wear a bra.
Yes,
I guess so.
After all,
you're thirteen.
Like a curse,
it sounded.
Thirteen.
Why on earth
are you looking at me like that?
What?
Mia twisted away
from her mother's hands,
weak hands
that could not keep her.
She'd been preparing
all that day
to tell her mother
about the boys at school.
She knew the term,
harassing.
But now?
No.
Thinking how when
she'd been a little girl,
and her body small
and smooth as a doll's,
and the nipples
on her chest so tiny,
you would hardly know
they were there.
Daddy had loved her.
Yes.
Should have known.
Staring at herself
in the bathroom mirror
naked,
which was a word
she hated.
Naked.
Staring with narrowed eyes
at her breasts.
Another word she hated,
though not so much
as she hated the word
boobs,
which were taking shape
as if of their own volition
against her wishes.
Fleshy,
soft-skinned,
pale,
with particular repugnance.
Mia stared at the small,
rosy nipples
she knew were meant
for a baby to suck.
Knowledge that filled her
with dismay.
Disgust.
Only a short while ago,
her chest had been thin
and flat as a boy's.
Her collarbone was still prominent,
and her skin pale
as white candle wax.
But unmistakably,
she was putting on weight.
Stomach and hips,
upper thighs,
and she was growing taller.
Taller?
She did not mind.
Taller would protect her
from the boys.
But gaining weight?
That,
Mia dreaded.
The worst thing
anybody could say
about a girl
was calling her fat.
Worse even than boobs
was the derisive
fat-ass.
All of the girls
shunned fattening foods,
or tried to.
Every girl Mia knew
was in terror
of gaining weight.
Still,
there were girls
not so thin
as other girls,
and there were girls
who were frankly
overweight.
Mia was still
slightly underweight,
according to online charts
she'd consulted.
But she wasn't
so thin as she'd been,
and there seemed to be
nothing she could do
about it.
Just as there was
nothing she could do
about hairs sprouting
in her underarms,
on her legs,
and between her legs.
Tried not to eat
fattening foods.
Tried not to eat
everything on her plate,
and not to have
second helpings.
No more sugar
on her cereal.
No more sugar-coated cereal.
No more whole milk.
Only non-fat milk.
And only non-fat yogurt.
The only good thing
about her father
leaving them,
and her mother
so agitated
and distracted,
Mia could skip
entire meals
without her mother
taking much notice,
and could get through
an entire day at school
not eating anything at all,
just drinking Diet Coke.
But then she was so hungry
when she got home,
she could not stop eating.
What she wished
was she could wake up
in her old body.
Flat chest,
flat hips,
smooth and hairless
as a doll's skin.
Dreaded,
daddy knowing,
any of it.
Especially how the guys
were teasing her,
tormenting her.
Ernie Dempster,
that was his name.
But there were others.
Just the way they looked
at Mia sometimes.
Even the nicer boys.
Maybe it was punishment
Mia deserved.
Not sure what she'd done,
but it had to be something.
So naive,
not realizing that
the contours of her body
were so visible
through her clothing.
Nothing she'd even
considered in the past.
It seemed to Mia unfair.
Her breasts
weren't really big yet.
The size of
medium-sized apples.
And maybe the boys
thought she was
good-looking.
Sexy.
If so,
Mia wasn't trying.
Couldn't help her face.
Hair.
In eighth grade,
maybe she was
mature for her age.
Why boys' eyes
snagged onto her.
Dreading to think
that her breasts
might continue to grow
to the size of her mother's.
Big,
heavy,
and spongy
like foam rubber.
Mia?
Are you even
listening to me?
Hello?
Mia's mother
snapped her fingers
in Mia's face,
exasperated.
What had mom
been saying?
Mia had no idea.
I was asking you.
Suddenly,
she could not
bear to be
around her mother,
running away
to hide in her room.
Undressing for bed,
eyes averted
from the mirror,
loose nightgown
like a sack,
and in bed,
lying on her right side
so that her tender,
fleshy breasts
were protected
by her arms,
and her arms
like folded wings,
hoping she would
dream of that
other
lost time.
In the underbrush,
a dark,
furry shape,
moving so swiftly
it is scarcely visible.
But if you stand
very still
and stare
long enough,
you will see
the feral cats
emerge,
wary,
watchful,
glittery eyes,
ears pricked
in alertness.
Learn to disguise,
camouflage,
hiding in
plain sight,
soon,
she'd perfected
her strategy.
Hide in plain sight.
At school,
slumping her shoulders,
hunching her shoulders
to make her chest
concave,
shielding her breasts
with her upper arms,
holding her books
against her chest
when she could,
when it didn't look weird,
in the corridors
between classes,
which was the dangerous
time when guys
could brush against her,
bump into her.
instead of wearing
her backpack,
carrying it in her arms
against her chest,
like a shield.
No more sweaters,
no t-shirts,
loose-fitting shirts
like boys' shirts,
not tucked into
her loose-fitting jeans.
Better yet,
a loose-fitting t-shirt
and over that,
a loose-fitting shirt.
Maybe,
over both,
a loose-fitting jacket.
Mia smiled.
The layered look.
So clever.
She had not the courage
or the nerve
to stare down the boys.
The feral cats
taught flight,
not fight.
As it happened,
other eighth-grade girls
were beginning to
mature as well.
One day,
you glanced up,
half of your friends
had boobs.
It wasn't just
physical maturity,
but behavior as well.
A way,
some girls
had of presenting themselves.
To be seen.
Admired.
Lipstick.
Even eye-makeup.
Eye-catching clothes.
Mia had no interest
in being eye-catching.
No lipstick for her.
Not only were her clothes
loose-fitting,
they were likely
to be dull,
drab colors.
Khaki.
Mud-brown.
Not bright-colored
sneakers with garish laces,
but the most ordinary
running shoes.
It was amazing to Mia
how other girls,
particularly older
high school girls,
so avidly sought
the attention of boys.
Some of these,
the very boys
who tormented Mia.
Why'd anyone want to
attract them?
Pierced ears,
pierced eyebrows,
noses,
upper lips.
Overnight,
it seemed,
many had tattoos.
Streaks of neon color
in their hair.
Very short skirts.
Halter tops like bras.
There were Jackie,
Dana,
Talia in eighth grade.
Girls who squealed
when boys collided with them
accidentally on purpose.
Teasing in the cafeteria,
in the parking lot
behind the school.
Girls who ran after boys
incensed and scolding,
thumping them
with their backpacks.
Girls who actually
wrestled with boys,
slapping and pummeling.
Mia shrank away,
not wanting even to be
a witness to such
stupid behavior.
And then,
one afternoon,
there was Janie,
of all people,
involved in a silly
confrontation
with a ninth grade boy
named Rocco.
And Janie running
to join her friends,
flush-faced
and eyes shining
with indignation.
What an asshole!
I hate him!
But Janie was so thrilled,
she could speak
of little else
but Rocco.
How pathetic,
Mia thought.
and how lonely
she was.
Thanks for asking,
but not great.
Pretty terrible,
in fact.
But I am not going
to kill myself
or anything crazy
like that.
Certainly I am not.
Wouldn't give that bastard
the satisfaction.
Anyway,
the kids are okay.
I want to think
they see through
their father's bullshit.
But at least my daughter
doesn't go to school
dressed like a hooker.
I mean,
at least.
Two.
Kitty?
Kitty,
kitty,
kitty.
It was the happiest
time in Mia's day,
visiting the colony
of feral cats
in the vacant lot
next door.
So little else
in Mia's life
she could depend upon
as she could depend
upon the feral cats
who might hide
from her in the underbrush
as she knew
were there.
And if she waited
long enough,
if she was patient
and quiet,
some of these
might appear.
Like a few neighbors,
Mia regularly
left food for the cats.
No matter how much,
it never seemed
to be enough.
The aluminum pie pans,
water bowls,
usually empty.
Mia supposed
that other animals
ate the food too.
Raccoons,
squirrels,
rodents.
She'd bought
a few packets
of dry food
for the cats,
but these were expensive.
To save money,
you had to buy
cat kibble in bulk,
in large bags.
But Mia couldn't
afford these.
If she took
too many leftovers
from the refrigerator,
her mother might
become suspicious.
Slipping out of the house
when no one could see her?
After school,
just before dusk,
was the best time.
She didn't want
her mother to know
that she was still
visiting the feral cats.
And she didn't want
her little brothers to know
they'd have followed her.
Mia recalled
how her father
had hated
the feral cats.
How he'd said,
half seriously,
that if he had time,
he'd set out traps
for them,
or poison.
The only good cat
is a dead cat.
Mia wanted to think
that he hadn't meant it,
exactly.
To Mia,
the feral cats
were consoling.
They kept their distance
in the underbrush,
wary and watchful.
But they did not react
in panic
when Mia spoke to them.
Calling,
kitty, kitty, kitty,
in a lowered voice,
was Mia's announcement
that she was there.
Unlike domesticated cats,
the feral cats
would never come
when called.
But eventually,
if you waited long enough,
several might appear.
Or rather,
if you waited long enough,
you would see cats
in the underbrush,
regarding you
with wary eyes,
and realize
that they'd been there
all along.
If Mia remained
very still,
patient and quiet,
the more adventurous cats
would approach
the food plate
she'd set down for them
and begin eating hungrily.
How happy
this made Mia.
Watching the beautiful
lithe creatures,
she forgot about school,
and she forgot her father.
Forgot boobs.
Once,
after school,
on a day when Mia
had avoided her friends,
or her friends
had avoided her,
she was waiting
for the feral cats
to appear
when a sensation
of extreme sleepiness
came over her.
And so she lay down
on the ground,
head resting
on her backpack,
and fell into
a light sleep.
This day,
in autumn,
approximately eight months
after Mia's father
had left the family,
just three weeks
since he'd shocked
Mia and her brothers
by announcing
that he'd been
transferred to Seattle,
and so wouldn't be
seeing them as often
as he'd have liked.
Not that he saw
Mia all that much.
Every third weekend,
or less.
She didn't miss him,
really.
Didn't think so.
It was harder
on the boys.
They missed their father.
Through closed eyes,
it seemed,
Mia could see
the feral cats
regarding her
from their hiding places.
A sleek black cat
lifting its head
to sniff.
A thick-furred tiger cat
squinting at her
with one good eye.
A mangy tortoiseshell
with a crooked tail.
A younger cat
with a predominantly
white coat
and glaring green eyes.
On the damp ground,
Mia lay very still,
keeping her eyes closed,
scarcely daring
to breathe,
wondering if the cats
understood that she
was their friend
and that they could
trust her.
Wondering if the cats
were communicating
with one another
about her,
and she could not
hear them.
Their silence
was uncanny,
like gauze
that shields,
protects.
The glittery eyes
moved over Mia,
suspicious,
wary.
She held herself
very still.
She would make
no sudden moves.
By degrees,
one of the feral cats
approached Mia,
the thick-furred tiger cat
with one-sided eye,
one blind eye.
Through her tight-shut eyes,
Mia could see,
or believe she could see,
the cat's single eye,
tawny as amber glass,
fixed upon her.
Slowly,
the cat approached,
slow and taut-muscled,
as if it were hunting.
So close now,
Mia could see
the bristling white whiskers,
the uplifted tail,
that looked as if
it had been injured.
I will not hurt you.
I love you.
Please let me pet you.
Slowly,
the cat approached,
slow and taut-muscled,
as if it were hunting.
Then,
Mia couldn't help it.
Her eyes opened
of their own volition,
and she saw
that the burly tiger cat
was within inches
of her face,
crouched low,
ears laid back
and teeth bared
in a soundless
warning snarl.
Don't.
Don't touch.
Mia sat up,
confused.
In an instant,
the feral cat
scrambled away,
vanished in the underbrush.
All the cats
had vanished
in that instant.
Mia was alone,
not certain at first
where she was,
shivering with cold,
clothes soaked through
from the damp ground
where she'd been lying
on rotted leaves.
There was her backpack
on the ground.
Vaguely,
she recalled
the desire to sleep
so strong
she could not withstand it.
How strange this was.
Nothing like this
had ever happened
to Mia before.
Her secret.
No one must know.
Her girlfriends
would tease her
or feel sorry for her.
It did not seem
to like her so much
lately.
Even Janie.
Her mother
would be furious.
Such asinine behavior.
Her father
would be disgusted
and wish never
to see her again.
And who could blame him?
Mia picked up
the backpack,
brushed at her
damp clothing.
It would appear
that she was alone
in the vacant lot.
And yet,
she felt the glittery
eyes upon her
invisibly.
Please trust me.
I am your friend.
But it was time
to leave.
The sky was darkening
with storm clouds.
And already,
there came a distant
rumbling sound,
as if from the
underside of the earth.
That night,
in her bed,
holding herself
very still,
as she'd held herself
still in the woods
in secret,
in cunning,
dreaming of making
herself small,
small and sleek
and deceptive
as a cat,
crawling into
the underbrush
to hide with
the feral cats
who were her
true friends
and companions.
The feral cat colony
was a labyrinthine
place,
like the interior
of a castle,
a place of refuge,
a warren,
small chambers
linked by small
doorways,
warm as the interior
of a beating heart.
And here,
Mia was able
to sleep
as she could not
sleep in her own bed,
for here she could
curl into a ball
among the others,
pressing against
their furry sides,
snug together
in this secret place
where there was
solace
and comfort
and protection,
as thunder
rumbled
far away
overhead.
3.
What do you think,
kids?
Like it?
Mia's mother
had had her hair cut,
styled,
lightened
to a brassy
gold color
that winked
and flashed
like a machete.
Mia was dismayed.
Her mother
looked
so young.
Nor did Randy
and Kevin
know what to think,
staring at their mother.
Was this glamorous,
grinning woman
Mama?
Ten months
had passed
since the father
had left them.
Mia never uttered
the word
Daddy
any longer.
The divorce
was said to be
final.
The father
had moved
to the West Coast.
Contact
between him
and Mia,
Randy,
Kevin,
was tenuous
and unreliable.
Mia's mother
had a new job,
real estate,
and a new car,
Prius.
She wore
designer jeans,
tight-fitting
suede trousers
and matching jackets,
high-heeled boots,
a fleece jacket,
a gorgeous
faux fox coat.
Her face
was heavily made up
as a face
on a billboard.
Her fingernails
that had been broken
and neglected
were now
meticulously filed
and polished.
She'd borrowed
money for the car
and for the clothes
and what she called
maintenance,
hair,
face,
nails.
But it was money
from a new friend
at a very low interest.
Recently,
Mia's mother
had been going out
on dates.
Mia couldn't imagine
anything more pathetic.
Her mother,
who had to be
in her late thirties
at least,
meeting men
on dating sites.
And soon then,
kids,
come here.
Mia,
come downstairs.
I'd like you to meet.
The name
was weird.
Mia hadn't understood
at first.
Later,
she would learn
it was Ferris.
As she would later
learn that
Ferris Locke
was a self-styled
entrepreneur
and consultant.
He had his own
startup company,
involved in some way
with the most advanced
computer technology.
How they'd met?
Oh,
this was comical.
Mia's mother
dissolved
into laughter
explaining,
something to do
with Match.com
and a misunderstanding
about a dinner date.
And Ferris Locke
grinned
and snatched up
her hand
and kissed it.
And Mia
could only scowl
in embarrassed silence.
Some things
feel like fate,
you know?
Destiny.
Mia's mother
was sober,
suddenly,
wiping at her eyes.
It's true,
but some things
are fate.
The universe
is predetermined,
living in the present tense
we can't see.
But when we look back
at our lives,
often we can.
In my own case,
Ferris Locke
spoke in a deep
baritone voice,
like a man on TV.
He wanted to think,
a man with a voice
like this
is to be trusted.
Ferris Locke's head
was big
and blunt
and near bald,
except for a fringe
of kinky,
grayish ginger hairs
at the base
of his skull.
His eyes
were unusually small,
wide set
in his broad face,
like the eyes
of a pit bull.
He had a mustache
and a wispy beard
that gave him
a rakish appearance
at odds
with his thick-set body.
Had to be older
than Mia's father
and not nearly
so good-looking,
though he had
a kindly-seeming smile.
Mia was trying
very hard
to like Ferris Locke.
Certainly,
she wanted to be
happy for her mother,
now that her mother
had a new friend.
But her face
felt stiff.
Her mouth
refused to smile.
Looming over her,
bearing his gums
in an eager smile,
Ferris Locke
asked Mia
which grade
she was in,
the most banal,
boring question
you could put
to anyone.
But Mia
did not roll
her eyes,
did not snigger
or scowl,
but tried to answer
politely
in such a lowered voice
that Ferris could not hear.
And Mia's mother
had to repeat
in a bright voice,
Eighth grade.
Ah,
eighth grade.
Well.
At this,
Mia did roll her eyes,
or nearly.
No.
Mia was determined
to be very good,
not to embarrass
her mother.
Yes,
it goes fast.
Time,
when you're a parent.
Mia's mother faltered.
Hadn't meant to say
exactly this,
but couldn't think
how to change the subject.
It seems like
the kids grow up
while you remain
the same.
The same age.
I know just
what you mean.
So true.
It was all
Mia could do
to keep from laughing
in the adults' faces,
each trying to impress
the other.
Why was her mother
teetering in ridiculous
open-toed high heels?
And what's-his-name
wearing a striped
purple shirt
of some
satiny,
glossy fabric
and ill-fitting
designer jeans
that looked brand new?
Every word
uttered by the two
of them was false,
phony.
Later,
Mia would recall
how Ferris Locke's
small,
beady eyes
fixed smiling
on her face
as her mother
was speaking,
as if not listening
to her mother
at all.
And then,
the small,
beady eyes
glanced downward
to Mia's
shapeless shirt,
to her legs
in jeans
and grimy
running shoes,
as if Ferris
was surprised
to learn that Mia
was an eighth
grade
and not
in a lower
grade,
that she was
at least
twelve or thirteen
and not younger.
For Mia
did not dress
like a girl
her age
or like a girl
at all.
Perplexed,
Ferris Locke
seemed,
bemused.
Still,
he didn't keep
asking his silly
questions,
as if he
respected Mia's
stiffness,
shyness.
Randy and Kevin
were shy also,
but flattered
by the adult
male's interest,
for it had been
a long time
since their father
had turned
such attention
upon them.
Ferris Locke
seemed wholly
sincere,
asking where
they went to school,
and if they
liked school,
which grades
were they in?
What did they
want to do
when they grew up?
And Ferris Locke
did seem to be
listening to them
as they answered
excitedly.
Mia thought,
don't fall
for it.
He's a phony,
just pretending
to care about us.
Though she had
to concede
it was touching,
the little boys
so eager
to receive
a stranger's
attention,
like a warm,
bright light
shining on
their faces.
As Mia's
mother looked
on,
her eyes
glimmering
with tears,
pathetic.
Mia didn't
want to think
how their
father would
sneer at
their mother's
new,
dear friend.
He would
disapprove of
their mother
seeing a man,
bringing a man
home,
introducing a man
to her children,
so soon after
the children's
father had
left.
Unfair,
but that's
how men were.
Mia was
beginning to
see.
Half-consciously,
she learned
to please
and placate
her father,
in order that
he would
smile at her,
and love her,
and not
ever
sneer at
her.
Or how
painful it
was to
see that
look come
into her
father's
face,
the subtly
uplifted
lip,
the cold,
mocking eyes
turned upon
some object
of disdain
and disapproval.
She learned
to dread
the sneering
faces of
boys,
quickly looking
away,
knowing she
must not
lock eyes
with them.
Anything
to do
with sex
provoked
the boys
to hyena
laughter,
as if
sex were
a threat
to them,
anything
to do
with softness,
tenderness,
boobs.
She learned
to dread
the sneering
faces of
boys,
quickly
looking
away,
knowing
she must
not
lock eyes
with them.
Still,
Mia's
brothers
seemed to
be getting
along very
well with
Ferris Lock.
Their faces
glowed as
they listened
to his
accounts of
whitewater
rafting in
Wyoming,
hang gliding
and bungee
jumping in
Australia,
mountain
hiking in
Peru,
hunting for
elk in
Montana,
shark fishing
in the
Florida Keys.
Exasperating
to Mia
to see
how eagerly
the boys
believed
these tales,
and even
Mia's mother
seemed willing
to overlook
the man's
boastfulness.
Mia's mother,
who claimed
to have
seen through
that bastard's
bullshit
in reference
to Mia's
father,
now falling
for this
bullshit
from a
man named
Ferris Lock.
Someday,
maybe,
we'll all
go on an
adventure
together.
How'd you
like that?
Ferris spoke
almost wistfully,
stroking his
wispy,
graying,
gingery beard.
But Mia
was already
slipping away,
heading upstairs
with the excuse
of homework.
No need
even to murmur
under her breath,
count me
out.
Here was
a surprise.
Ferris Lock
wasn't going
away.
Maybe not
such a surprise.
Mia's mother
seemed to like
Ferris so much.
She was seeing
him several times
a week.
No matter
that Mia
distrusted him,
Mia's mother
trusted him.
He's very
nice.
He's a
gentleman.
He's much,
much nicer
than any
other man
I've ever
met,
and that
includes
you-know-who.
He thinks
you kids
are terrific.
Isn't that
wonderful?
Said he'd
always wanted
to have kids,
and now he
can afford
them.
Mia gathered
that her
mother had
gone out
with other
men whom
she'd met
online,
and that
these dates
had not
turned out
so well.
But Ferris
Lock was
different,
somehow.
Repellent
to think of
her mother
having sex
with a man,
and certainly
with this
man.
But Mia
was beginning
to wonder
if she'd
been too
quick to
judge
Ferris
Lock.
Clearly,
her mother
did seem
happier since
she'd met
Ferris,
and being
happier,
she was nicer
to Mia
and her
brothers.
That was a
fact.
And maybe
Mia's mother
deserved to
be happy,
even if there
was something
pathetic in
Ferris Lock
providing happiness
for her.
Mia recalled
how her father
had often
interrupted her
mother,
or talked
over her,
as if not
hearing her.
Much of the
time,
he'd scarcely
listened to
her.
But Ferris Lock
listened to
her,
and seemed
intensely
interested in
whatever she
said.
He says
we're such
a beautiful
family.
His
actual
words,
beautiful.
If you
didn't listen
to their
actual
words,
Mia thought,
it was
maybe
not so
pathetic.
To
adults who
were maybe
lonely,
at any rate
not married
and not
young,
trying to,
well,
whatever they
were doing,
taking a
chance on
love,
once more.
Ferris Lock
didn't just
take Mia's
mother out.
Often he
took the
family out.
Dinner,
movies,
Treasure Island
Park.
When Mia
stayed home,
she felt a
pang of
jealousy,
envy,
wondering if
they missed
her,
hoping that
her mother
would call
her on her
cell phone,
just to
check how
she was.
But her
mother didn't
call,
and Mia had
too much
pride to
call her.
And
Ferris Lock
brought them
presents.
For the
boys,
a spaceship
video game
suitable for
younger boys.
Junior
astronaut.
For Mia,
an exquisite
little locket
on a silver
chain.
Authentic
mother of
pearl.
Reluctantly,
Mia thanked
Ferris.
Reluctantly,
Mia smiled.
Not that
she approved
of her
mother's
man-friend.
She did
not approve.
But still,
if her
mother had
to have
a man-friend,
Ferris Lock
wasn't the
worst.
Pray for
me,
Mia.
I want
so badly
for this
to work.
The words
spilled from
Mia's mother
with such
urgency,
Mia couldn't
scowl or
turn away
in embarrassment.
Or maybe,
after all,
it was all
what Mia
wanted.
Her mother
to be happy,
her brothers
to be happy.
At least,
not unhappy
as they'd
been.
Four.
And Mia
had her own
secret happy
time.
Except,
one afternoon
in late winter,
hurrying to the
feral cat colony
after school
and seeing to
her horror
that something
had happened.
Everything
had changed.
Seeing to
her horror
that the
underbrush
had been
cleared away
and the
partly thawed
earth were
heavy tire
tracks.
The aluminum
foil pie
plates and
plastic bowls
had been
crushed,
mangled.
Oh,
no.
Oh,
no.
Mia stood
unmoving,
unable to
comprehend.
The feral
cats were
gone?
It was as if
Mia had been
dealt a blow
to the chest
in the region
of her heart.
She heard her
breath come
quickly,
hoarsely.
Could not
believe it.
A sensation
of faintness
suffused her
body.
She was afraid
to give in
to tears.
If she began
crying,
she might not
be able to
stop.
That had
happened a few
times,
since Daddy.
not often,
not for a
while.
Crying,
giving in.
Mia had it
under control,
mostly.
But now?
No.
Someone in the
neighborhood must
have called
animal control.
Someone like
Mia's father,
who hated the
feral cats and
wanted them
destroyed.
In a trance,
Mia stood,
staring.
She could not
breathe at first,
waiting for
what?
A movement
in the
devastation?
A flash of
orange or
black or
white?
A muffled
cry?
Except for the
calls of birds,
it was very
quiet here.
Far away,
overhead,
a droning
aircraft.
If you
listened very
closely,
the sound of
wind in the
trees.
Kitty?
Kitty,
kitty.
The vacant
lot covered
an area of
about three
acres.
Much of the
land was
impassable,
dense with
trees,
underbrush.
Mia had
never ventured
far into
the woods.
She had to
wonder if
some of the
cats had
run away,
fled in
terror,
and were
hiding.
The
canny,
thick-furred
tiger with
just one eye
that had
approached
Mia when
she'd
fallen asleep.
The sleek
black cat
that kept
its distance
warily.
The slender
white cat
with marble-like
markings and
glaring green
eyes.
Surely one
of these
had escaped.
At least
one?
So badly
Mia wanted
to believe,
she'd begun
to tremble
with anticipation.
But it was
terrible to
see how a
heavy vehicle,
a bulldozer,
had been
driven into
the lot
from the
road,
flattening
and uprooting
bushes,
young trees,
brambles and
thistles,
creating a
kind of
primitive
roadway,
gouging
the earth.
There'd
been beauty
in the
uncultivated
land.
Now all
was broken,
ugly.
Mia felt
a pang
of sheer
rage for
the adults
who'd
perpetrated
such
cruelty.
It was
so unfair,
Mia thought,
so cruel.
The cats
were beautiful
creatures,
condemned
because they
were homeless.
It was
not their
fault that
they lived
in the
wild,
that they
had no
homes,
owners.
They'd
rarely left
their territory
except at
night.
They harmed
no one.
Few people
even knew
they existed.
And yet,
Mia thought
of how,
in the
derisive
world of
school,
such a
loss would
be ridiculed.
She would
be ridiculed.
It filled
her with
horror to
think of
the coarse
boys at
school who'd
tormented
her,
discovering
the vacant
lot,
the feral
cat colony,
and making
the cats'
lives miserable.
At least,
that had
not happened.
And at
least,
the boys had
stopped singling
out Mia.
Other girls
had caught
their eyes,
better-looking
girls,
more mature
girls.
Mia had
learned to
hide her
body from
the gaze of
predators as
the feral
cats had
learned to
hide,
disguise,
camouflage,
hiding in
plain sight.
How she
hated the
crude,
cruel boys.
Thinking of
them, she
felt her
heart begin
to beat
rapidly.
That
sensation of
being trapped,
jeered at?
She'd have
liked to be a
slender young
cat to escape
her tormentors.
Kitty?
Kitty,
kitty,
kitty,
in a
forlorn voice
calling as a
child might
do.
But she was
tired now
and feeling
hopeless.
Her feet
were wet,
she'd lost
her gloves,
her hands
were stippled
and bleeding
from thorns,
her breath
was beginning
to steam.
It was late
afternoon,
she had no
choice,
she'd have to
give up her
search.
A wave
of loss
swept over
her,
a feeling
of angry
despair.
And then
she saw,
what was
it?
A small,
dark body,
motionless
in tall
grasses?
To her
horror,
a cat's
body,
a corpse.
None of
the feral
cat she
recognized,
she didn't
think so.
A cat
twisted on
its side,
eyes open,
unseeing.
A cat
of about
medium size
with mangy
gray fur,
a stubby
tail.
It had
crawled into
the underbrush
to die,
Mia thought.
Maybe it had
been injured
by the
bulldozer.
Her eyes
welled with
tears,
spilled over
with tears.
Suddenly,
she was
sobbing.
Hate,
hate,
hate,
hate,
hate.
Whoever
had done
this?
Leaving
the ravaged
lot,
Mia
encountered
an older
woman in
a hooded
jacket,
trousers and
boots,
who was
just
arriving.
She'd
witnessed
the raid
of the
cat colony
by the
township
animal
control
unit that
morning,
she said.
She'd been
checking back
every few
hours to
see if there
were any
cats remaining
she might
rescue.
This had
to be
Gladys
Hansen,
one of the
neighbors who'd
fed the
feral cats
for years,
with whom
Mia's father
had had a
disagreement.
Bitterly,
Mrs. Hansen
told Mia that
another neighbor
had called the
township animal
control department
to arrange for
a raid on the
colony that
morning.
She'd hurried
over to try to
prevent them,
but arrived too
late,
and anyway,
they'd outnumbered
her.
There was
nothing I could
do but scream
at them.
They surrounded
the cats and
captured them in
nets,
Mrs. Hansen
said.
Then they
bulldozed the
underbrush.
A more
humane way
would have
been trapping
them,
but that
would require
too much
time.
If any
cats had
escaped the
nets and
were in
hiding,
they didn't
seem to
care if
they'd
injured
them or
killed
them.
And all
in the
name of
public
safety.
The
pretense is
that the
township is
doing this
for the
cats'
well-being
because cats
in the
wild sometimes
get feline
leukemia and
other illnesses.
But of
course,
all they're
going to
do is
euthanize
the cats.
They are
not going
to help
them,
not even
the kittens.
It's easiest
to kill
them all
and not be
bothered with
treating any
of them.
Feral cats
usually can't
be adopted,
but kittens...
Mrs. Hansen
paused,
breathing heavily.
Tears shone
in the woman's
eyes,
and Mia was
in dread of
seeing an
older woman
cry.
Those
beautiful
creatures
have as
much right
to live
as anyone,
as much
right to
live as
we do.
Politely,
Mia excused
herself.
The last
thing she
wanted to
do at
the moment
was commiserate
with another
person.
Returning
home,
she managed
to avoid
her mother,
who was on
the phone
speaking
animatedly,
with Ferris
Locke,
or with a
woman friend
about him.
Though later,
Mia's mother
knocked on
the door
of her
room,
to ask
her what
on earth
was wrong.
You scared
your brothers,
Mia.
They said
it looked
like you'd
been crying.
Well,
I am not
crying.
I'm doing
homework.
It was
true.
Mia lay
sprawled on
her bed,
her math
textbook and
notebook spread
about her.
Her mouth
was dry,
her heart
beat hard
in fury.
She had
not been
able to
calm her
rushing thoughts
since she'd
returned home.
Who had
taken the
time to
complain about
the feral
cats?
And why?
Out of pure
meanness?
Her father
would be
satisfied now
if he'd
known.
Mia stood
at her
window,
gazing out
into the
gathering
darkness.
Sometimes in
the past,
she'd seen
small,
fleeting figures
in the
grass.
Feral
cats?
So quickly
they appeared
and disappeared
she couldn't
be certain.
But now?
Nothing.
Soon,
Ferris
Locke
arrived
downstairs.
The jocular
booming voice
greeting
Mia's mother
and Randy
and Kevin
filled Mia
with a
sensation
of dismay.
It was
becoming
so familiar.
Is he
going to
move in,
Mom?
He's
here all
the time
now.
No,
Ferris
is not
going to
move in.
Not here.
Something
about Mia's
mother's
voice,
Mia hadn't
wanted to
hear more.
No,
no,
no,
no.
The evening
meal passed
in a haze
of misery
for Mia.
She could
not keep
from thinking
about the
feral cats
trapped in
nets.
She could
imagine
their terror.
And then?
The terrible
bulldozer,
the mangled
body lifeless
as debris,
resenting
Ferris Locke's
ebullience at
dinner that
jarred so
with her
mood.
She could
not concentrate
on the
conversation
such as
it was.
Ferris
spoke,
Mia's
mother
listened
adoringly,
Randy and
Kevin listened
adoringly.
Mia wondered,
what was
wrong with
her?
She'd
been hurt
to think
that her
brothers
had been
frightened
of her.
Aware that
Ferris was
asking her
something,
vaguely,
she replied.
She had a
math test
the next
morning.
She was
distracted
thinking about
it.
The kindly
gaze drifted
on to
Mia,
lingered
on Mia.
The mouth
smiled.
She could
not respond.
Her heart
was broken.
Mia?
Is
something
wrong?
Ferris
spoke
gently.
Mia
shrugged.
No.
She's
moody
all the
time.
She
doesn't
mean to
be rude.
It's
a phase
she's
going
through,
as people
say.
Mia's
mother
laughed
to show
that she
wasn't
concerned.
Ah,
yes.
Phases.
I remember
them well
when I was
Mia's age.
You were
never my
age.
Go away.
After
dinner,
as Ferris
and the
boys watched
a video
Ferris had
brought over,
Mia helped
her mother
clear away
dishes and
clean up
in the
kitchen.
The
magnetic
board,
where Mia's
father's
fancy
Japanese
knives had
been
displayed,
was
empty.
Mia's
eye was
drawn to
it,
waiting for
her mother
to scold
her for
being rude
to their
guest.
But her
mother only
said in
a lowered
voice,
please,
will you
just try,
Mia,
for my
sake?
You don't
have to
love him.
Love him?
Why would
I love
him?
Mia was
indignant.
If,
if Ferris
comes into
our lives
more
permanently.
More
permanently?
What does
that mean?
But Mia's
mother turned
away.
To keep
from crying?
To keep
from smiling?
As soon
as she
could,
Mia ran
upstairs.
From
below,
laughter
wafted to
her.
Family
laughter.
She did
not belong
in this
family.
It was
understood
that Ferris
Locke stayed
overnight on
evenings he
came for
dinner.
No one
seemed surprised
any longer.
Mia could
see that
Randy and
Kevin were
not dismayed,
but rather
relieved.
their
mother's
friendly,
flush-faced
friend wouldn't
be abandoning
them that
night.
Sleeping
together?
Disgusting.
Mia had a
difficult time
concentrating on
schoolwork.
Mia had a
difficult time
trying to
sleep.
When the
house was
still and
darkened and
it was nearing
1 a.m.,
Mia threw
on clothes,
located a
flashlight,
and made
her way
outside,
back to the
vacant lot.
It was
daring to
step outside
in the
night.
How surprised
her mother
would be,
and upset,
and embarrassed
if Ferris
Locke knew.
Fresh,
cold,
damp air.
Overhead,
a faint moon
like a half-closed
eye.
Mia felt a
stab of
excitement,
following the
flashlight beam,
shining light on
ugly,
gouged tire
tracks,
broken and
shredded
trees.
Somewhere
close by,
a hoot
owl called,
an eerie
floating cry
that made
hairs stir
on the
nape of
Mia's
neck.
Sharp,
pungent
smells of
thawing
earth,
rotted
leaves and
branches,
making her
careful way,
staring at
what the
flashlight
revealed,
that looked
so different
from daylight.
All color
seemed to
have been
bleached
away.
Here was
a twilight
world of
uprooted
trees,
gnarled
roots.
Her breath
steamed
faintly.
It had to
be below
freezing,
but Mia
had thrown
on only
jeans and
a light
jacket.
Silence.
The
hoot owl
had ceased.
Mia was
some distance
from the
roadway,
in an area
beyond the
devastation.
Here was
a twilight
world of
uprooted
trees,
gnarled
roots.
Then,
she heard a
faint mewing
sound from
a few yards
away,
almost inaudible.
In an instant,
she was alert,
hopeful.
She stooped,
peered.
Kitty?
Where are you?
On her hands
and knees,
Mia crawled
into the
underbrush,
awkwardly wielding
the flashlight,
lifted debris,
and was
astonished to
see in the
beam of light
a single,
small kitten,
ghostly white,
mucus-sticky
eyes enormous
in its face.
An adult
feral cat
would have
arched its
back,
bared its
teeth,
hissed,
and fled
an intruder.
But the
little white
kitten only
stared at
Mia and
mewed
piteously.
The sound
resembled
meow.
Like my
name,
Mia.
Mia managed
to capture
the kitten
that hissed
silently at
her and
made a
feeble gesture
as if to
scratch her
with its
miniature claws.
But Mia was
wearing gloves
and long
sleeves.
The kitten's
tiny claws
were harmless.
Mia laughed
in delight.
The kitten
weighed virtually
nothing in her
hand, a
squirming bit
of white
fluff, a
twitching tail,
eyes that
appeared to
be entirely
black, all
pupil.
The only
living creature
amid the
terrible
devastation.
And Mia
had rescued
it.
She would
bring the
stricken
kitten back
to the
house with
her.
There was
no question
about that.
She would
save its
life, for
clearly it was
starving, lost
without its
mother.
As soon as
Mia lifted
the kitten
to hold
against her
chest, it
ceased
struggling, but
continued to
make the tiny
bleeding sounds
as Mia
carried it
back to the
house.
Meow,
meow,
meow.
Poor kitty.
But you are
safe now.
Five.
That night,
it was revealed
to Mia in
a dream that
the true name
of the white
kitten was
Meow Dao,
and that it
was no accident
that Meow Dao
had come to
dwell with Mia
and sleep
beside her on
her bed.
The promise
was that from
that night,
Mia would
never be
alone.
Even when
Mia was away
from the house
and away from
the white
kitten, the
spirit of
Meow Dao
accompanied her,
and the
memory of
Meow Dao's
soft, feathery
white fur
and deep
purr and
eyes glittering
like black
marbles
remained with
her.
In school,
when Mia felt
awkward or
lonely or
self-conscious,
she would
only have to
recall Meow Dao
snuggling against
her in the
night, sleeping
against Mia's
arm or side
or sometimes
on Mia's
pillow to
feel secure,
safe,
loved.
Naively,
Mia had
hoped to
keep the
feral kitten
a secret
from her
mother.
But of
course,
within a
day or
two,
Mia's
mother discovered
the kitten
in Mia's
room,
where she'd
set down
bowls of
food and
water and
a makeshift
litter box
fashioned out
of sand and
bits of
dirt in a
closet.
Mia had
been trying
to clear the
kitten's eyes
of mucus
as well.
Mia!
This is one
of those
feral kittens,
isn't it?
You've brought
into our
house?
Mia's
mother was
more
exasperated
than angry.
She'd heard
about the
raid on
the feral
colony,
she said.
She'd heard
that the
animal control
unit had
arrived early
in the
morning,
before anyone
was aware
of what
was happening,
so that they
could clear
out the
underbrush
and take
away the
cats without
interference.
Did you
call them
mom?
Mia spoke
with barely
concealed
sarcasm.
She'd
picked up
the little
white kitten
to shield
it in her
arms from
her mother.
No,
I did
not.
I didn't
know anything
about it
until afterward.
Mia
supposed that
was so.
Her mother
wasn't the
sort of person
to complain
to the
township.
But I
think the
raid was
necessary.
The
feral population
was increasing.
Wildcats have
all sorts of
diseases that
can spread
to pets,
and they
have short
lifespans.
Not this
one.
I intend
to take
care of
Meow Dao
myself.
Mia's
mother didn't
quite hear.
Meow
what?
Meow Dao.
That's her
name.
You can't
take her
away from
me.
She
belongs
here.
Mia's
voice
lifted
stubbornly,
excitedly.
She determined
that Meow Dao
was female.
I don't
think so,
Mia.
This is
such an
unsettled
time in
our lives.
That's
why she
belongs
here.
If
your
father
knew.
Well,
he doesn't
have to
know.
He's
gone.
Mia
spoke
bitterly,
yet with
an air
of
satisfaction.
And
then,
there's
Ferris.
What has
Ferris got
to do
with it?
He
doesn't
live in
this
house.
He
doesn't
have
jurisdiction
over
me.
That's
ridiculous.
Boldly,
Mia
continued
to oppose
her
mother.
With
the
instinctive
cunning
of a
girl
of
thirteen,
she
understood
that her
mother was
faltering
out of
guilt.
She
must
not
falter
herself.
Finally,
Mia's
mother gave
in.
Mia
could
keep
the
kitten,
for the
time
being,
as long
as she
cared for
it and
was
responsible
for it.
Of course
I will
care for
Meow
Dao.
I love
her already.
love
was such
a
defiant
word.
Mia
saw
with
satisfaction
that
her
mother
winced,
just
perceptibly.
Well,
it will
have to
be taken
to a
vet.
It
will
need
shots.
Its
eyes
are
infected.
If
it's
a
female,
as you
seem
to
think,
it
will
need
to
be
spayed.
Mia's
mother
spoke
doubtfully,
as if
she might
rescind
her
permission
at
any
moment.
And
I
think
it
should
be
kept
in
the
basement,
not
in
your
room,
or
not
only
in
your
room.
That
won't
be
healthy
for
either
of
you.
Mia
murmured
in
agreement,
thinking,
Meow
Dao
will
sleep
with
me
every
damn
night.
See
if
you
can
stop
us.
Well,
it,
she,
is
very
beautiful,
despite
the runny
eyes.
So
small,
the
little
white
kitten
had
been
fearful
at
first
of
Mia's
mother's
raised
voice,
but
had
begun
now
to
relax
in
Mia's
arms,
flexing
her
tiny
claws
into
the
fabric
of
Mia's
sweater,
on
the
brink
of
purring.
But
when
Mia's
mother
reached
out
to
pet
the
feathery
soft
top
of
the
kitten's
head,
Meow
Dao
suddenly
hissed
at
her
and
swatted
at
her
hand.
Oh,
what?
Mia laughed.
The sight
of the
tiny
kitten
hissing
and
clawing
at
an
individual
so
much
larger
than
herself
was
comical.
The
alarmed
expression
on
Mia's
mother's
face
was
comical.
The
kitten
claws
were
much
too
small
to
break
the
surface
of
Mia's
mother's
skin.
But
quickly,
Mia said
that
Meow
Dao
hadn't
meant
it.
She's
just
nervous
around
anyone
else
but
me.
Mia's
mother
was
looking
chagrined,
wounded.
Well,
tell
Meow
whatever
her
name
is.
She's
on
probation
in
this
house.
Tell
her
that.
Six.
A
few
weeks
later,
Mia's
mother
and
Ferris
Locke
were
married.
A
small
private
wedding
ceremony,
not in
a church
but in
the local
courthouse
in the
office of
a
justice
of
the
peace.
Quasi
secret,
as Mia's
mother
wanted
it.
Now
you
kids
have
a
new
dad,
one
who
really
cares
about
you.
Was
this
so?
Mia
hated
to
think,
yes,
maybe,
for the
original
dad,
daddy,
had faded
from their
lives like
one of
those
sunsets
that
begins
slowly,
emblazoning
the sky
with a
fiery
light,
but ends
abruptly,
a sudden
dimming,
then out.
Mia's
father was
always promising
to fly
east to
spend some
time with
his children
he was
missing
like
crazy,
or suggesting
that the
children fly
to Seattle
to spend
some time
with him
and the
new
wife.
Except there
was never
the right
time convenient
for everyone.
for a
while,
Mia
had
haunted
the
new
wife's
Facebook
account,
fascinated
that the
new
wife,
with the
silly
name
DeeDee,
resembled
Mia's
mother as
she'd
looked,
judging
from
photos,
20 years
ago.
But she
lost
interest.
DeeDee
was just
too
boring,
posting
reports
of her
pregnancy.
And if,
when,
DeeDee
had a
baby,
was this
baby supposed
to be
Mia's
half-sister
or brother?
Mia's
lip
curled
in
disdain.
Embarrassing
as a
half-sibling
might be,
it was
more
embarrassing
that
Mia's
mother
was
getting
remarried.
Mia
couldn't
bring
herself
to
tell
her
friends
at
school.
One
more
reason
why
she
was
drifting
away
from
her
friends.
Or
maybe
her
friends
were
drifting
away
from
Mia.
Why
do you
need
them?
You
don't.
You
have
me.
Warm
against
the
side
of
Mia's
leg
or
her
arm,
sometimes
curled
up on
the
pillow
beside
her
head,
the
little
white
feral
kitten
slept
every
night
in
Mia's
bed.
Mia
would
have
been
lonely
with
her
mother
away
on
her
honeymoon,
a
week
in
Sarasota,
Florida,
on the
Gulf
of
Mexico,
except
for
Meow
Dao,
who
purred
even in
her sleep
to comfort
Mia.
Why do
you need
them?
You
don't.
You
have
me.
All this
while,
Meow Dao
was growing
rapidly.
Twice a day,
sometimes more
frequently,
Mia made
sure that
Meow Dao
was fed,
with cat food
purchased with
Mia's allowance.
Soon,
Meow Dao
was no
longer a
kitten,
but a
lean,
lithe,
sleek
young
cat,
with
wary
eyes,
pricked
up ears,
a
switching
tail.
Her
fur
was
snowy
white,
without
a
blemish,
no
stripes
or
spots
anywhere
on
her
body.
Like
the
interior
of
her
mouth,
the
pads
of
her
feet
were
pale
pink.
Her
whiskers
were
unusually
long
and
stiff,
like
the hairs
in
her
ears.
Soon,
Meow Dao
ceased to
use the
litter box
in Mia's
closet,
mewing to
be let
outside.
Mia was
sorry.
She'd hoped
that Meow Dao
would be an
indoor cat.
The
veterinarian
who'd
examined
Meow Dao
had strongly
advised this,
but it
soon became
impossible for
Mia to
restrain the
restless
young cat.
Mia
compromised
by putting
a collar
with an
ID tag
and a
little bell
around
Meow Dao's
neck
to
curtail
Meow Dao's
hunting.
But
Meow Dao
was always
slipping out
of the
collar
and
sometimes
brought
back to
the
house
for
Mia
little
gifts
of
prey,
mangled
mice and
birds,
frogs,
once even
a wounded
garter snake.
Often now,
Meow Dao
was gone,
sometimes for
hours,
and each
time Mia
was anxious
that she
wouldn't
return.
But
Meow Dao
always
returned.
Sleeping in
the crook
of Mia's
arm,
snuggling
against
Mia,
quiet
purring
deep in
Meow Dao's
throat was
consoling as
a lullaby.
But
sometimes
Mia
wakened
with a
start to
discover that
the warm
furry
figure was
gone.
At the
rear door
of the
house,
calling,
Kitty,
Kitty,
Kitty,
holding her
breath until
the white
cat appeared,
trotting to
her.
Rubbing
against
Mia's
legs,
butting
Mia's
legs with
her head,
purring,
Mia adored
the sleek
young white
cat that
belonged to
her.
She'd never
had a pet
before,
though she'd
wanted one
for years.
Her father
had joked
that he
preferred dogs
to cats,
but no animal
at all to
either dogs
or cats.
Randy and
Kevin had
pleaded for
a puppy,
but no.
Who would
do the
work?
We know
who would
do the
work.
M-O-M.
Mia's
mother had
laughed to
soften her
sharp words.
Mia noted
that Meow
Dao didn't
seem drawn
to anyone
else in
the family.
When her
little brothers
sighted
Meow Dao,
they eagerly
approached her,
but Meow Dao
coolly eluded
them.
No matter
how they
pleaded
with her,
she seemed
scarcely
to see
or to
hear them.
But if
they tried
to corner
her,
she bared
her teeth
and hissed
at them.
Don't
scratch
them,
Meow Dao.
They're
just children.
They don't
mean any
harm.
Meow Dao
allowed
Mia's mother
to feed
her,
sometimes
even to
stroke her
fur.
But
Meow Dao
never rubbed
against Mia's
mother's
legs or
purred audibly
in her
presence.
Pointedly,
Meow Dao
avoided
Ferris
Locke,
who stooped
over her
wanting to
tickle her
beneath the
chin.
Pretty
kitty?
What's
your name,
Meow Dao-y?
Ferris laughed,
as if the name
was ridiculous to
him,
unpronounceable
as a foreign
name.
Mia began to
notice.
When Ferris
entered the
house,
Meow Dao
slunk away.
If she'd been
purring and
pressing
against
Mia's
hand,
she went
very still
at the
sound of
the man's
jocular
voice.
Hello,
I'm
home.
Where is
everyone?
And
soon
disappeared.
Once,
Mia
happened to
see or
imagined she
saw the
man who
was her
stepfather
giving a
little kick
at Meow Dao
as she fled
past him
through a
doorway.
When Mia
opened her
mouth to
protest,
Ferris said
quickly,
Hey,
we're just
playing around,
Meow Dao-y
and me.
Soon after
this incident,
Meow Dao
stayed away
overnight.
Mia was
anxious,
searching outside
the house
calling,
Kitty,
kitty,
kitty.
Randy and
Kevin helped
Mia look for
Meow Dao.
Mia's mother
offered to
drive her
around the
neighborhood.
Only this
stepfather
seemed indifferent,
if not
ironic.
Cats run
away,
dear Mia.
This was
a feral
cat.
Cats have
no loyal
genes in
their bodies,
unlike dogs.
Tearfully,
Mia told
her mother
she thought
Ferris had
hurt
Meow Dao.
Maybe he'd
taken her
away somewhere,
left her
by the side
of the road.
She wouldn't
put it past
him to take
revenge on
Meow Dao
because
Meow Dao
didn't like
him.
That isn't
true,
Mia.
Ferris
wouldn't do
such a
thing.
He has
told me
he thinks
the cat
is a
great
beauty.
He just
wishes it
was more
civil to
him,
which is
what he
says about
you,
too.
Another
day,
and a
night,
and still
Meow Dao
was missing.
Mia rang
doorbells in
the neighborhood.
No one
had seen a
young white
cat.
If it
was one
of the
feral
cats,
it probably
just ran
away.
You can't
domesticate
them.
They're
wild like
chimpanzees,
and sooner
or later
they turn
against you.
Politely,
Mia listened
to such
remarks,
bit her
lower lip
to keep
from crying,
thanked
whoever it
was,
left her
name and
telephone
number
behind,
along with
the photo
of
Meow Dao
gazing up
at the
camera with
widened
eyes.
Certainly
is a
beautiful
cat,
people said,
though some
stared at the
photo,
frowning.
For was it
natural,
a snowy
white cat
with black
eyes?
Didn't
white cats
usually have
blue or
green eyes?
Of course,
Mia returned
to the vacant
lot several
times,
though knowing
it was probably
useless tramping
to the rear
of the property
and back again
through the
underbrush,
pleading,
Kitty,
Kitty,
Kitty,
Meow Dao,
oh please,
come back.
Nothing
Mia could
do,
she knew,
if Meow Dao
preferred to
live in the
wild and
not with
her.
Still the
ugly tire
tracks remained
in the
earth,
a turmoil
of uprooted
trees and
bushes,
a devastation
of storm
debris,
litter.
Even the
smells were
sharp,
unpleasant,
a sour
rotted
odor under
foot.
The
beautiful
feral
cats were
gone.
Mia would
have liked
to curl
up and
sleep with
the
feral
cats as
she'd
done
when
she'd
been
younger,
when the
feral
cats had
allowed
her,
or as
Mia had
dreamed of
sleeping with
the feral
cats but
had not,
actually.
Had she?
Mia stayed in
the vacant lot
for an hour
or more,
not wanting to
return home.
Through the
trees,
she could see
lighted windows in
the distance,
her own
house,
the houses
of neighbors.
How petty
human life
seemed to
her,
how banal.
Her mother
and the new
stepfather
were altogether
banal.
It frightened
Mia that
she disliked
them so,
for they were
all she had
of family,
now that
Meow Dao had
abandoned her.
If she could
run away as
Meow Dao had
run away.
But where
had Meow Dao
gone?
Mia felt a
clutch of
panic,
thinking that
just possibly
Meow Dao had
been taken in
by another
family,
another girl
Mia's age,
and slept
with this girl
on her bed
now,
and not with
Mia,
who loved
her so.
Not wanting
to think,
he has killed
her,
run her over
in the street,
poisoned her,
because she
didn't love him
as the rest
of us are
supposed to
love him.
7.
Soon after
the return
from the
honeymoon,
soon after
Ferris Lock
moved into
Mia's mother's
house,
it became
clear that
Ferris Lock
was Master.
Of course,
no one ever
called him
Master,
not even
Mia.
Though noticing
that now he
and her mother
were married,
Ferris wasn't
so,
would you call it,
gracious,
patient,
thoughtful,
willing to
listen as
he'd once
been.
A gentleman,
Mia's mother's
word.
For it seemed
that in any
discussion,
Ferris had to
get his way,
whether the
subject was
X, Y, Z.
He just
pretends to
listen to you,
Mom.
He just
lets you talk.
Of course,
Mia's mother's
new husband
wasn't as rude
and impatient
to her as
Mia's father
had been to
her.
But then,
he'd only been
her husband
for a few
weeks.
Nor did
Ferris seem
nearly as
interested in
Randy and
Kevin as
he'd once
been.
No time
for the
boys'
chatter,
impatient
when they
clamored for
his attention.
Don't you
two have
homework to
do?
I'm sure
you do.
He chided
Mia's mother
for spoiling
her sons.
He chided
the boys
for not
respecting
their mother.
With Mia,
he was more
circumspect,
cautious,
seeing the
expression in
Mia's face
of wariness
and disdain
for him,
the intruder
in the
household.
Now you
have a
stepdad,
you know
you are
protected.
Anything
anyone says
to you
does to
you.
Just let
me know,
honey.
Mia
bristled.
Honey?
Her
father had
sometimes
called her
this.
She'd
basked in
her father's
attention
like a
cat.
But not
Ferris
Locks.
And did
Ferris have
as much
money as
he'd
boasted
of before
the wedding?
This
wasn't so
clear.
The nature
of Ferris'
business was
mysterious,
unpredictable.
He didn't
seem to be
selling any
actual
product,
any computer
or electronic
device you could
see.
He didn't
seem to
own a
building,
a factory,
even a
suite of
offices.
He'd been
working out
of his
condominium in
a high-rise
building,
which he'd
subsequently
sold.
Vaguely,
he spoke of
profits,
losses,
fluctuations of
the market.
Yet he
owned,
or was,
a corporation.
For Mia had
seen mail
addressed to
Ferris Lock
Consultants,
Inc.,
but she had no
idea what this
could be.
And what did
consultant mean
anyway?
Couldn't anyone
be a consultant
on any subject?
When Mia asked
her mother about
Ferris Lock
Consultants,
Inc., her mother
had told her
irritably that it
was none of her
business.
Mia had the
impression that
her mother didn't
know much more
than Mia knew.
True, Ferris Lock
seemed to have
money.
He boasted that
he'd sold his
condominium for
more money than
Mia's mother's
house, four
bedrooms, was
worth.
He'd repaid
loans Mia's
mother had
taken out during
the months of
the divorce, as
well as her
legal fees.
How grateful
Mia's mother had
been for
Ferris's generosity.
Mia was
thinking her
mother might
have confused
gratitude for
love.
Eight.
Hate, hate,
hate them.
lying in wait
for another
girl after
school, the
Dempster boy and
two or three
others.
A girl who
wasn't Mia, but
this girl must
have known that
they were there
and avoided
them.
And there came
Mia, unwitting
and oblivious, and
even her loose
fitting clothes did
not spare her from
their derision,
vulgarity.
Panicked, Mia ran.
The boys hooted
with laughter,
pretended to be
pursuing her, but
soon lost interest,
making her way
home, hands over
her ears.
How Mia hated
their braying
laughter.
She had to be
grateful that they
didn't jostle
against her, actually
touch her, as
they'd done in the
past, grateful that
other, sexier
girls usually drew
their attention.
If she told her
mother, possibly
her mother would
drive to school to
pick Mia up, but
it was likely her
mother would also
insist upon speaking
to the school
principal, and Mia
would be questioned,
and Mia would be
forced to say that
she didn't know who
the boys were, didn't
know any of their
names, for if she
told on them, if she
uttered the name
Ernie Dempster, it
would only be worse
for her.
She knew.
Almost, Mia was
tempted, to tell
Ferris, stepdad,
protect you.
But no, not a good
idea.
Anything Mia did
would only involve
her in a way she
didn't want to be
involved, and
stepdad might offer
to pick her up from
school, and she
didn't want that.
Mia was unhappy,
missing Miao Dao,
it had been weeks
since the beautiful
white cat had
disappeared.
Mia's mother offered
to drive Mia to the
animal shelter to
bring home a rescue
cat, but Mia refused,
indignant.
I only want Miao Dao.
I told you, I love
her.
But Mia, she's gone.
We've looked
everywhere.
She might come back.
She knows where we
live.
If stepdad overheard,
he might say
insufferably,
Cats run away, Mia.
That's how cats are.
Especially that's how
feral cats are.
As if meaning to
console Mia, but
maddening her instead.
That's how assholes
are.
You said it.
In the night, Mia
awoke from dreams
of agitation and
loneliness, pursued
by jeering boys,
desperate to hide,
to squeeze herself
into, what was it?
Underbrush?
The devastated cat
colony?
Struggling to breathe,
Mia reached for Miao Dao
in the bed beside her
and woke despondent.
Miao Dao was not there.
But there was another
dream that came to
Mia sometimes.
A lovely dream
in which Miao Dao
came silently
to sleep in the
crook of Mia's arm
against her heart.
And then,
the most palpable
dream,
a dream of being
smothered by Miao Dao
clambering onto her
chest.
No longer the young,
slender,
white cat,
but a muscled,
mature cat,
with large paws
and sharp upright ears
like a fox's ears,
glittering black eyes,
and what a purr,
low guttural rumble
like a panther's.
Did you think
that I would leave you?
I would never leave you.
Have faith.
In an instant,
Mia wakened,
sitting up in bed,
confused and excited.
But another time,
Miao Dao had vanished.
Still,
in Mia's bed,
in the air about the bed,
a smell of wet earth,
rotted leaves and grass,
something dark and viscous,
like blood.
Nine.
Okay,
sweetie,
call me dad.
Smiling,
baring damp teeth,
not adding,
please.
His eyes lingering on her,
when she was feeling sad,
as if to console.
Not that Mia smiled back,
or remained in his view,
for very long,
no.
Yet,
the way he smiled at her,
as her brothers chattered,
signaling it was,
me and you,
and not the boys.
They hadn't a clue.
The way he winked,
a playful wink,
a half wink,
as Mia's mother spoke,
in a bright,
glib voice,
to which neither the stepdad,
nor Mia was listening.
Where's your locket,
sweetie?
The one I gave you.
How come you never wear it?
Did you lose it?
Stepdad,
pretended to pout.
Mia protested,
she hadn't lost the locket,
just didn't wear necklaces,
all that much.
Face warm,
confused feeling.
Was he calling her sweetie now?
As her father had,
but not for a long time.
Honey,
sweetie.
Had to be silly,
if not pathetic.
Mia felt comforted by such names,
beginning to see why her mother fell for Ferris Lock,
such kindness in his manner.
Following this,
Mia remembered to wear the locket,
at such times and in such places,
when Ferris was likely to notice.
Actually,
she'd been somewhat hurt.
Stepdad had thought she might have lost it.
Pretty,
murmured,
so that only Mia could hear.
Though Mia pretended not to hear.
Pretty necklace,
or
pretty Mia.
At school,
she had to be vigilant,
for when she chided herself,
you're just imagining it,
don't be ridiculous,
they are not looking at you.
Often,
she turned out to be mistaken.
In fact,
yes,
the jeering boys were looking at her.
Also on the street,
at the mall,
if she happened to be alone,
especially,
not with other girls,
whose laughter,
clothing,
makeup,
drew the attention,
of observers.
For other girls,
didn't mind so much,
or seemed actually to enjoy,
to bask in,
the attention of male strangers.
Though Mia's friends could be shocked,
offended,
when a guy or guys said something really crude,
gross,
obscene to them,
suddenly the attention wasn't so welcome.
But when Mia was alone,
no protection.
That sensation of eyes drifting onto her,
snagging on her like birds,
though she continued to wear shapeless t-shirts,
pullovers,
no skin-tight jeans,
like the other girls,
no.
As if the boys saw through Mia's disguise,
her desperation.
As predators can perceive a wounded animal,
very slightly limping,
trying to console herself,
they don't mean anything.
They don't mean anything.
It isn't personal.
Her body,
they were interested in.
Not Mia herself.
And so,
it was not personal.
Except today,
they call after her.
Mia!
Mia!
Mia!
Mia!
They know exactly who she is.
They are waiting for her.
As if the boys saw through Mia's disguise,
her desperation.
As predators can perceive a wounded animal,
very slightly limping.
Embarrassed,
ashamed,
walking quickly,
shoulders slumped,
head down.
Her heart is beating crazily.
Almost she feels that she will faint.
Cuts through an alley,
blindly running,
staggering.
Then,
at an intersection,
she finds herself crossing a street,
looking neither to the right,
nor to the left,
desperate to escape the boys.
There comes the sound of a horn,
very loud,
close by.
Mia panics,
freezes.
Watch where you're going!
An impatient,
male voice.
Mia manages to get to the curb,
before a wave of dizziness sweeps over her.
She is gripping a railing.
So important not to faint,
to fall.
Her breath comes swift and shallow,
and she has no idea where she is,
what time this is,
who has been pursuing her,
and why she is so frightened,
but why also the fear has begun to lessen.
Like a tourniquet,
being slowly unwound,
makes her way home,
where,
that night,
in her bed,
Miao Dao awaits her.
Ten.
Next morning,
news was a ninth grade local boy,
had died in what was being called a vicious assault.
The body was found in the early morning amid trash cans in an alley near his school.
Head wounds,
deep lacerations in the scalp,
throat violently slashed by some sort of clawed instrument or serrated knife.
The 15-year-old victim was believed to have bled out while desperately trying to crawl on his belly out of the alley to the street 20 feet away.
Like wildfire,
like wildfire,
this news spread through school.
Mia was as astonished as anyone,
hearing,
having to ask several times,
who was it?
No one in their class.
Last name,
Dempster.
Oh my God!
Who did it?
How did it happen?
When?
What was Ernie doing there,
in the alley?
As others marveled at the news,
shocked,
thrilled,
shaking their heads in awe,
Mia hung her jacket in her locker,
quietly.
No questions for anyone.
Afterward,
in her first class,
recalling the welcome surprise of the white cat snuggling beside her in the night.
How thrilled Mia had been that Meow Dao had returned,
wet-muzzled,
smelling of something dank,
earthy.
For no reason she could have said,
Mia smiled.
Is this kid somebody you knew,
Mia?
Mia's stepfather was frowning,
at the lurid headlines on the front page of the newspaper.
Mia shook her head.
No.
Sounds like he was practically decapitated.
Christ!
Mia's mother came to lean over Mia's stepfather,
in a way that offended Mia,
resting her arms on the man's shoulders,
nudging her chin alongside his head.
Mia saw that her stepfather didn't take much notice,
only continued reading.
Ernest Dempster,
15,
9th grade.
Not in your class, eh?
Mia shook her head.
No.
Did he belong to a gang?
Maybe that was it.
There aren't gangs in schools here.
Mia,
there aren't gangs at your school,
are there?
Or in the high school?
Mia shook her head.
No.
Maybe it was a pervert.
Picked up the kid,
slashed his throat.
Has to be something sick like that.
Glancing around for Mia.
But Mia had vanished from the kitchen,
silent as a wraith.
11.
For her 14th birthday,
a silver bracelet engraved,
Mia.
Birthday cake,
14 candles,
having to blow them all out,
shutting her eyes in the effort.
Mom had meant well,
mom always meant well.
Devil's food cake,
chocolate fudge frosting,
which was,
anyway,
used to be Mia's favorite frosting.
Glasses of wine for Mia's mother
and Mia's stepfather at dinner.
Glasses refilled.
Singing happy birthday to Mia,
adults and Mia's brothers,
and Mia's face burned with embarrassment,
an abashed sort of pleasure.
The bracelet was a joint present,
Mia's mother said.
She and Ferris had picked it out together.
Mia thought,
Daddy,
wouldn't have bothered.
Daddy wouldn't have had time.
Dreading the birthday for weeks,
wishing she could skip the birthday.
The last birthday she'd been happy
had been her 12th.
Wishing time would stop.
If her father returned now,
seeing Mia taller,
older,
what mom called,
filling out on top,
he'd be disgusted.
The stepfather urged Mia
to sip a half glass of wine.
Hadn't wanted to,
but always you had to give in.
Ferris kept coercing.
Easier to give in than to keep saying no.
Ferris never accepted no.
Mia winced at the strong,
tart taste of the wine at first,
but the second sip was easier.
Her tongue seemed to be warming,
thrumming.
Sensation of warmth in her throat,
chest,
slipping on the silver bracelet.
Ferris urging her to say thank you,
thank you with a kiss,
laughing as Mia shrank away,
sliding his arm around her waist
so she hadn't any choice.
Mia giggled,
uneasily.
Hot wine kiss,
a smudge of a kiss against her cheek,
somehow lurching in the direction of her mouth.
Her mouth!
So surprised,
she hadn't pushed him away,
just stood there.
If his fat tongue had tried to enter her mouth,
it had not.
She'd have been unable to keep it out,
and somehow,
she knew.
He must know that.
Mia's mother,
fussing with Kevin,
eyes averted.
The hand drifting across her hips,
light as a caress.
Not heavy.
In fact,
had her stepfather actually touched her?
It was like the kiss.
Couldn't be sure.
Electricity in that touch.
Hairs stirring on her arms,
and at the nape of her neck.
Stir.
Sadness.
Resignation.
Sudden fit of giggling.
Anger.
Daddy had abandoned her,
to the stepdad.
Mia?
Where are you running to?
Nowhere.
Upstairs.
Homework.
Meow-dow.
Mia is astonished,
too surprised at first to be upset.
Mia has just stepped into the bathroom,
is about to close the door.
Confused.
To see the door is being pushed open.
Not hard,
but firmly against her arm.
In the crack of the door,
the ruddy,
flushed face.
Hey,
sorry.
He's drunk.
He's laughing.
Can't be an accident,
Mia thinks.
The stepdad must have been watching for Mia to enter the bathroom in the upstairs hall,
close by Mia's room.
Must have moved swiftly.
Hadn't give Mia time to shut the door,
let alone lock it.
What
do you want?
Go away!
Mia's mouth is dry.
Mia's heart
hammers in her chest.
Away from the house,
Mia wears shapeless clothes.
But sometimes in the house,
the stepdad has seen her in just a t-shirt with jeans,
shorts,
his eyes crinkling at the corners,
lingering on her like crawling ants.
No plausible reason for Ferris Lock
to be using this bathroom
when there is a bathroom attached to the large bedroom he shares with Mia's mother,
which none of the children use.
In fact,
Mia has never seen Ferris Lock use this bathroom.
Mia is uneasy.
There has been a change in their relations.
After the smudged kiss on Mia's mouth
on the evening of her 14th birthday.
What Mia remembered afterward
is that the fat tongue
had tried to push into her mouth.
At the time,
she'd been too confused to know what was happening.
For in panic,
Mia had shut her jaws tight,
teeth tight.
Fear,
contending with disbelief,
outrage.
But my mother was three feet away.
My mother was right there.
He would not have done that
with mom right there.
Yet,
change is in the air.
He has changed.
Late winter,
dripping eaves,
gusting wind,
melting snow,
sudden splotches of sunshine,
a sense of wildness,
restlessness,
cries of spring birds.
Mia returning home
from field hockey practice,
Mia peeling off the shirt
she wears over her t-shirt,
Mia in shorts.
He
has seen
the stepdad
out of the corner of his eye.
But my mother
was three feet away.
My mother was right there.
Evenings,
at mealtimes,
something is different.
Stepdad is drinking
more than he used to,
beer,
mostly.
Often the stepdad
is resolutely
not looking
at Mia.
Where previously
he'd talked with Mia,
talked and laughed,
as he did with the boys.
Now,
not looking.
Though when he does,
he asks about
the silver bracelet.
Why aren't you wearing it,
Mia?
Haven't lost it,
have you?
His tone is both
bossy and wistful.
The bully
is always the one
who has been
hurt.
Mia's mother
urges her to wear
the bracelet
and the locket,
at least when
stepdad will notice.
Mia objects.
She doesn't wear
jewelry much,
especially a silver bracelet
that rattles
when she's typing.
Please,
Mia's mother begs.
Please try.
He's your husband,
not mine.
Mia doesn't know
whether to feel
relief or annoyance
or concern
or hurt.
The sudden alteration
in the stepdad,
swift as a blind
yanked down.
Even when Mia
remembers to wear
the bracelet
or the locket,
Ferris keeps his eyes
averted from her
and turns his attention
on Kevin and Randy,
who compete with each
other to impress him.
When he can't avoid
acknowledging Mia,
he is inanely polite.
Would you please
pass the salt,
Mia?
Thank you.
Mia wonders if her
mother notices
this excessive
politeness,
but decides no.
Her mother does
not notice.
To be a mother
with a new husband,
Mia thinks,
you must learn
to not notice
much.
A shock to Mia
when her mother
steps out of the room
and the stepdad
turns his hungry gaze
on Mia,
rushing like a dog
released from a kennel.
The boys don't matter.
The boys won't notice
how stepdad
is suddenly smiling
at Mia,
stroking his beard
in that way
Mia hates,
caressing himself,
tip of a fat pink tongue
glistening between
his lips.
Dirty girl.
Sure you are.
Think I don't know you?
Mia is astonished.
Mia looks away,
face burning.
And that night,
in the upstairs hall,
at Mia's bathroom door,
his skin seems coarser,
more flushed,
swollen nose riddled
with broken capillaries
that Mia has not
noticed before.
Stepdad mutters
an apology
that doesn't sound
very apologetic.
He said I was sorry.
Don't be so touching,
Mia.
Retreats to the adult's
bedroom at the farther
end of the hall.
Mia presses against
the door to hold it shut.
She is trembling,
disbelieving.
After using the bathroom,
Mia hurries to her room,
shuts the door,
but cannot lock the door,
thinking,
maybe it was an accident.
He wouldn't come into this room.
Not with Mia's mother
in the house.
Mia drags a chair
to the door,
positions it,
so that the door
can't be opened.
Each night,
Mia leaves her window
open a few inches,
even in cold weather.
for when she goes to bed,
if she lies very still,
after a while,
Miau Dao
might come to her,
silently,
through the window.
Not every night,
not most nights,
but Miau Dao
will only come at night,
and only when Mia
lies very still
beneath the covers,
breathing calmly
and evenly.
Her secret,
precious,
how the beautiful
white feral cat
uses her sharp claws
to climb up a tree
beside the house
and leaps from a limb
of the tree
to Mia's windowsill,
lowers her head,
pushes through
the narrow space
and into Mia's room.
With a muted little cry,
Miau,
the white cat
leaps onto the bed,
burrows beneath
the bedclothes,
presses against
the side of Mia's body.
Her purring
is thunderous.
Into the crevice
beneath Mia's arm,
Miau Dao's
hot breath,
the solace
of her soft,
thick fur,
quick-eating heart.
Mia smells
the sweet,
sour aroma
of damp blood
on the cat's breath,
for,
of course,
Miau Dao
is a huntress,
falling asleep
to the deep,
guttural purring
that takes on
the rhythm
of Mia's heart.
Sometimes Mia wonders,
is this
Miau Dao
she'd rescued
as a tiny kitten?
Hardly a year
has passed,
and Miau Dao
is a large cat,
still lithe,
but solid
and muscled,
weighing at least
twenty pounds.
Nothing kittenish
about the shining
dark eyes,
sharp,
glistening teeth,
steely claws.
Almost,
Mia thinks
that this
beautiful white
creature
isn't the
original
Miao Dao,
but another
who has taken
Miao Dao's place.
Your stepfather
murdered the kitten,
stomped her
to death
with his feet.
You know this,
or should.
I have been chosen
to take her place.
He will not
murder me.
Twelve
On the stairs
in the upstairs hall,
where it seems
he is always
lying in wait.
As he passes Mia,
passes close by Mia,
seeming not to mind
if Mia hears
his quickened breath,
trailing a hand
across her back,
just a touch,
small of Mia's back,
a phantom touch.
She flinches
from him,
sees that look
in his heated face,
suet-colored eyes
like flies,
alighting on something
rotted and delicious.
He makes her feel ashamed
just
being herself.
For Mia has become
strangely weak,
tentative,
telling herself
she is not afraid
of him,
the stepdad.
she is afraid
of her mother.
Afraid for
her mother.
Afraid that
her mother
will be devastated
if Mia tells her
what is happening.
Mia has overheard
sharp words
between her mother
and the new husband,
for the new husband,
Mia's mother
is learning,
is not so very
different from
the previous husband.
Mia doesn't
want to notice.
Mia doesn't
want to care.
Mia cared
too much
in the past
and doesn't
want to care
now.
In recent months,
since the honeymoon
in Sarasota,
Ferris doesn't
try so hard
to please
Mia's mother.
He is away
from home
more frequently.
His laughter
is often jarring,
mirthless.
Mia wonders
if something
has gone wrong
with Ferris Lock
Consultants, Inc.
She remembers
how anxious
her mother was
when her father
had first
become estranged
from them.
Worries about money,
about keeping
the house.
She wonders
if her mother
is beginning
to have such
worries again.
Wanting to
accuse her mother.
Why did you
marry him?
Why did you
bring a stranger
into our house?
And now,
does the stranger
own half our house?
Returning home
from school
to discover
in her room,
on her bed.
A magazine
that appears
to have been
casually dropped
onto the coverlet.
Hulp magazine,
with a naked,
ludicrously
big-breasted woman
on its cover.
Hot eye candy.
Mia laughs aloud.
This is so...
tacky.
Stupid.
Silly.
Gross.
With averted eyes,
Mia picks up
the magazine,
does not glance
through it
as the stepdad
wants her to.
Instead,
she quickly slips
the magazine
into her backpack,
goes downstairs,
takes care that
her mother doesn't
notice where she
is headed,
disposes of the
magazine in the
big green trash
container in a
corner of the
garage.
Not the recycling
bin for magazines,
paper,
where the magazine
might somehow be
discovered.
Another day,
Mia discovers in
her math textbook
small drawings
in red pencil.
Crude cartoon
drawings.
Female body?
Breasts?
She is astonished
that an adult man
would go to such
lengths to harass
her.
Take such time.
Rubbing at the
small red drawings,
trying to erase
them,
tearing pages.
Finally,
Mia scribbles over
the drawings with
a red pencil of
her own.
If anyone saw how
her math text has
been defaced,
they would be
utterly perplexed.
But then,
Ferris keeps his
distance,
avoids Mia,
misses dinner with
the excuse of a
business meeting.
Where is dad?
The boys ask their
mother.
When did her
brothers begin
calling stepdad
dad?
Mia wonders.
She is,
is not,
afraid of him.
All she has to
do is scream.
All she has to
do is run away.
All she has to
do is confess to
her mother how
he is harassing
her.
That look of
sick yearning,
resentment,
anger beneath.
Slack lips,
wet smile,
meat smile.
In the upstairs
hall where
suddenly he
appears again,
his shirt
falling open,
exposing the
rounded fatty
stomach covered
in gray hairs,
matted hair on
his chest,
nipples like
little buttons.
Male nipples.
Mia wants to
laugh wildly.
And another
time,
pushing open
the bathroom
door,
when Mia would
have sworn
Ferris wasn't
home.
Go away!
Leave me alone!
I hate you!
Red-faced,
the stepdad
mutters his
lame apology.
Sorry.
Clumsily backing
away,
guessing that
this time,
he has gone
too far.
As Mia has
gone too far,
past a point
of no return,
instead of
shrinking away,
as she has
in the past,
this time
declaring,
I hate you.
A relief,
Mia flees
the house,
across the
backyard,
into the
shadows at
the edge
of the
property,
into the
adjacent woods
where the
feral cats
once lived.
Meow-dow?
Are you
here?
Kitty-kitty!
Her voice is
hopeful,
pleading.
Here is a
mangled
landscape,
overgrown even
where the
bulldozer raised
trees and
underbrush,
and now trash
is being dumped
in the lot.
Rotted
newspapers,
plastic soda
bottles,
cans.
Bitterly,
Mia thinks,
what a loss.
The feral
cat's home
was raised
for this.
It is quiet
here.
No one knows
that Mia is
here.
If Mia stands
very still
and looks
carefully,
she can see
ghost cats
in the shadows
watching her,
warily.
I am your
friend.
I love you.
Out of the
shadows,
the beautiful
white-furred
cat appears,
the size of
a lynx,
big pod
with a plume
of a tail,
shiny,
dark marble
eyes fixed
upon Mia.
Here I am.
Did you think
that I had
abandoned you?
As Mia
stares,
Meow Dao
makes her way
through the
underbrush,
unerring,
scarcely
hesitating,
graceful as
a wraith.
Not daring
to breathe,
Mia leans
forward to
pet the cat.
But just
as she is
about to
touch Meow Dao's
head,
there is a
clumsy,
clattering
sound behind
her.
There comes
a loud
voice.
Mia?
Hey,
where are
you?
Ferris Lock
has followed
Mia into
her secret
place.
Mia is
stunned,
resentful.
In an
instant,
Meow Dao
has bounded
away and
is gone.
Ferris Lock
has been
drinking,
eyes like
crawling ants.
how Mia
hates him
and fears
him.
He is a
bully,
and yet
there is
something
weak,
yearning
about him,
stroking
his bearded
chin,
tugging at
the skimpy
hairs.
Mia can
hear him
breathing,
as if he
has become
winded.
This is
our secret,
hey?
Your mother
doesn't know
where you go
every night,
how you're
prowling out
here at night.
Just what
the hell
are you
doing,
Mia?
Meeting
a boyfriend
here?
Boys?
Stepdad
leers at
Mia.
He has
been advancing
upon her
and now
he stops,
calculating.
Should he
reach out?
Touch her?
Take hold
of her?
And if he
does,
what will
Mia do?
He knows
how quick
the girl
is,
how rapid
the reflexes
of a girl
of fourteen.
He knows
how she
can turn
against him,
scream at
him,
I hate
you,
must calculate
the risk
of terrorizing
her against
the possibility
of overpowering
her.
If he can
manage it,
he believes
that Mia
will cease
resisting
and give
in.
Yet,
it is quite
possible that
the concerned
stepfather
feels responsibility
for the
stepdaughter.
it is
possible that
he is
genuinely
bewildered.
For why
would a
fourteen-year-old
girl tramp
out here
into a
scrubby
woods?
What can
draw her
to this
desolate
place
gouged
with tire
tracks?
Litter.
All right,
Mia,
let's go
back home.
Stepdad
speaks
familiarly,
as if he
has the
right.
But Mia
shrinks
away,
muttering
she can
find her
own way
home,
thanks.
To
stepdad's
surprise,
Mia breaks
into her
run,
as a
defiant
child might,
ignores the
man calling
after her
as she
runs through
the woods,
along the
narrow path
through the
brambles.
Mia feels
the same
thrill as
when she's
on the
hockey field,
running with
a stick
gripped in
both hands,
out-distancing
her opponents.
stepdad is
left behind,
thwarted,
and panting.
Stepdad has
come into the
vacant lot
from the
street,
can't navigate
the path
through
brambles.
By the time
stepdad returns
to the house,
Mia is
upstairs in
her room,
thinking,
is it my
fault
that Ferris
lock has
so altered?
This past
year,
since he
has married
Mia's
mother and
moved into
their house,
now that
Mia is
fourteen and
older,
not a
child.
He has
become
crude,
obstinate,
scratching
roughly in
the area
of his
groin,
as if
unconsciously,
but then,
gradually,
with
unmistakable
crudeness,
when Mia has
no choice
but to
pass close
by him,
and the
simpering
sounds emitted
from his
mouth for
only Mia
to hear.
Dirty
girl,
Mia.
Playing
with Randy
and Kevin,
pretending to
be listening to
the boys
chatter,
then suddenly,
upstairs,
standing outside
Mia's room,
belt undone,
trousers open,
obscene motions
with his hand.
Mia is
utterly shocked,
taken by
surprise.
Her eyes
shift downward,
unable to
look away.
At first,
she is
stricken with
shame.
Then she
hears herself
laugh,
wild snort
of laughter.
What's that?
You've got
to be kidding!
Instantly,
the stepdad
ceases the
obscene motions,
flinches away
from Mia's
jeering eyes,
mortified.
so quickly
it has
happened.
Mia would
never have
expected this.
A thrill
of power,
that the man
can be
assaulted in a
way particular
to him,
his maleness.
She realizes,
the man's
power is to
intimidate,
to make you
ashamed,
but your
power over
him is the
power of
laughter.
for,
Mia sees,
it is
very funny.
The man's
penis,
the flabby
thighs of
the middle-aged
man,
the stubby
flesh between
the thighs
brandished as
a kind of
weapon,
but limp
now,
slack and
defeated,
laughable.
Mia slams
the door to
her room
shut,
not in
fear,
but in
laughter.
laughter,
13.
Bad
Mia.
As
Ferris
glumly
predicted,
she has
lost the
silver bracelet
engraved
with her
name,
reporting to
her mother
reluctantly,
guiltily,
after Mia
has enlisted
Kevin and
Randy to
help her
search for
the bracelet
upstairs and
downstairs,
with no
luck.
Mia's
mother is
stricken,
but Mia,
how on
earth could
you lose a
bracelet
with a
clasp
like that?
Mia shrugs
her shoulder,
no idea.
Did you
wear it
to school?
Mia
considers,
not sure.
If you
did,
it might
turn up
in the
lost and
found.
Did you
look there
yet?
Mia
frowns,
not yet.
Your
stepdad
will be
so
disappointed,
so upset
if he
finds out.
Mia
agrees.
Better
not tell
him.
Another
day,
alone in
the kitchen
together.
As if she
has just
thought of
it,
Mia's
mother lowers
her voice
to ask
Mia if
Ferris has
touched her
ever.
Mia is
stunned by
this question,
yet Mia has
no idea how
to reply.
realizing what
courage has
been summoned
by her
mother to
ask such a
mortifying
question,
Mia sees
the dread in
her mother's
eyes,
shakes her
head
mutely,
no.
No?
He hasn't
touched
Mia?
Or
threatened
to touch
her?
N-
No.
Eyes
averted,
voice
lowered.
Mia assures
her mother
that there
is nothing
to tell
her.
Mia's
mother
persists
fearfully.
Mia,
are you
sure?
Flushed with
anger,
Mia laughs.
I told
you,
Mom.
Sure.
has to
be a
coincidence,
for Mia's
mother and
Mia's
father are
not in
contact,
that Mia's
father calls
her the
following
day,
the first
call from
Mia's
father in
weeks,
and asks
her,
in a casual
way,
what it's
like to
live with
a new
dad.
And Mia
can't think
how to
reply,
that would
not incriminate
her mother,
or call
attention to
Mia's
unhappiness,
and worsen
their lives.
Mia understood.
Her father
does not
really want
her and her
brothers to
be happy
without him
in their
lives.
Though,
of course,
Mia's
father does
not really
want the
children of
his first
marriage in
his life
any longer,
for he
has a
new family
now.
New wife,
new baby,
girl.
Mia bites
her lip,
feeling a
stab of
jealousy that
her father
has a new
daughter
replacing her
mother.
Especially,
Mia's father
does not
want his
ex-wife
to be
happy
without him.
All this,
Mia knows.
It makes
Mia sad
to know,
but she
knows.
So,
assuring her
father that
the new
dad is
terrific,
and mom
a lot
happier,
now than
she'd ever
been before
in Mia's
memory.
At the
other end
of the line,
silence.
Mia's
words are
a rebuke,
an insult.
Stiffly,
Mia's father
murmurs,
Great news.
Just great.
Thanks.
Soon after,
the conversation
ends.
Mia has a
premonition.
It will be a
long time
before he
calls again.
Fourteen.
Stunning.
The animosity
between Mia
and the
adult man
legally related
to her
as her
stepfather.
The thrill
of it.
A greater
thrill,
because at
close range,
more intimate
than the
animosity
Mia felt
for her
tormentors
at school.
No one
torments
Mia at
school any
longer,
since the
death of
the Dempster
boy,
which has
never been
satisfactorily
explained.
Throat
slashed,
as if with
a large
serrated
knife,
a clawed
instrument.
Neither
weapon ever
found,
and no
suspects.
At Mia's
school,
people still
speak in
hushed voices
of the
death,
the
murderer.
Mia's
friend
Janie
has heard
from a
family friend
whose
brother-in-law
is an
officer on
the local
police force
that Ernie
Dempster may
have been
involved with
drugs,
selling drugs
at the
school,
and was
killed as
punishment,
or as a
warning.
No news
about the
kid with
his throat
slashed?
Farrah
sometimes asks
Mia at
mealtimes in
an ironic
voice.
The
mysterious
unexplained
death seems
to intrigue
him.
With Mia's
mother,
Randy,
Kevin looking
on,
listening,
Mia has
to report
that there
is no
news,
not that
she knows.
Ferris
makes a
tisking
sound,
as if,
in some
way,
the death
of Mia's
older classmate
is a
symptom of
something
gravely
wrong with
the culture
of youth
to which
his obstinate
stepdaughter
belongs.
Yes,
Ferris has
discovered that
the silver
bracelet is
missing.
And yes,
Ferris has
declared himself
bluntly and
curtly
pissed.
Stroking the
stupid,
wispy beard,
twisting his
mouth in a
grimace,
showing the
moist tip of
the snake
tongue,
just fleetingly,
so that no
one else at
the table will
see.
Only Mia.
My fault,
Mia thinks.
Dirty girl.
The tense,
drawn look in
her mother's
face reminds
Mia of the
tense, drawn
look in her
mother's face
at the time of
the divorce.
But now,
Mia's mother
tries to
disguise it
with makeup.
Not very
successfully.
Is Mia's
mother drinking
again?
Mia has
reason to
think so.
Secret
drinking.
But Mia
can guess.
If Ferris has
been out,
this means that
Ferris has been
drinking.
There is a
pretense of
business meetings,
conferences.
Ferris Lock
Consultants, Inc.
is primarily
an online
business,
Mia has
gathered.
Not sure if
it has an
office anywhere
except inside
Ferris Lock's
console computer,
now established
in the downstairs
guest room where
Mia's father
once slept.
His footsteps
on the stairs
after the house
has darkened.
His presence
outside Mia's
bedroom door,
as if the man
is brooding,
contemplating,
what he would
like to do
to her.
What he will
do to her.
When he can.
When she can't
stop him.
Soon.
Mia is fully
awake,
trembling.
She has dragged
a chair against
the door,
in such a way
to prevent it
being opened.
Beginning to
sweat with the
possibility that,
if he's drunk
enough,
Ferris will
repay her for
laughing at him.
The unforgivable
insult,
laughter,
a rebuke of
the maleness
of the man,
unbearable to
him.
If he is
determined enough,
Ferris can
push open the
door,
send the chair
flying.
If he is
angry enough,
insulted.
Mia can scream
for help,
of course.
Yet,
screaming for
help will only
madden Ferris.
If Mia's mother
comes to her,
Ferris will be
furious at her.
He has yet to
touch either of
them,
in anger or
impatience.
He has,
yet,
to discipline the
young boys,
though Mia can
see how at times
he would dearly
like to,
and possibly
will,
soon.
He is far
heavier than
Mia,
far stronger.
He has been
drinking,
which is a kind
of strength.
If he wishes,
he can force
himself into
the room,
and cause Mia
to scream in a
way she has
never screamed.
Dirty girl,
this is what
you like.
The boys at
school loved it,
that Mia was
terrified of them.
Ernie Dempster's
ecstatic face.
She'd seen the
face astonished
with a spattering
of blood,
the eyes
dulling.
Mia stands
very still in her
nightgown,
barefoot.
The window
has been left
open a crack
to let in
Miao Dao.
But it may be
one of those
nights that
Miao Dao does
not push her
way into the
room to sleep
beside Mia,
but remains
outside in the
woods.
If Mia wants
Miao Dao,
Mia may have
to seek Miao
Dao in the
woods.
Outside her
door,
Ferris has
moved on.
She is
fairly certain
that Ferris
has moved
on.
Thank God.
Perhaps she
imagined him
outside her
bedroom door.
She is
faint with
relief,
laughs
aloud.
Another
night,
and the
stepdad has
spared her.
Fifteen.
A raincoat
over the
nightgown,
feet thrust
into sneakers.
Mia is too
excited to go
to bed.
The air in
her room is
stultifying.
Slips from
the darkened
house,
runs across
the lawn,
through damp
tufted grass,
into the
shadowy wooded
lot next door,
where Miao Dao
and the other
feral cats
await her.
A hazy
night,
a night like
gauze,
mist.
Objects melt
together,
their boundaries
are unclear.
Mia is
thrilled to
be here.
Mia can
breathe here.
Mia is
very happy
here.
Mia wants
only to curl
herself up
here.
Mia would
like to
shrink to a
size not
much larger
than Miao Dao.
Mia will
burrow into
the underbrush.
She will be
protected by
the feral cats
who love her
and who would
never wish to
hurt her.
her.
Hey,
Mia!
A crude
chortling,
clumsy
stumbling
in underbrush.
A flashlight
beam jerks
over Mia,
blinding her.
Mia tries
to shield her
eyes with her
hands,
provoking
derisive laughter
in her pursuer.
She is in
despair.
Ferris has
followed her
to this secret
place and
defiled it.
She is sick
with dismay.
The feral
cats will
flee now.
Miao Dao
will never
appear out
of revulsion
for Ferris
Locke.
Ferris is
laughing at
her.
The look in
her face of
shock,
alarm,
mortification.
Ferris is
and
Ferris is
also irritable,
menacing.
His words are
slurred,
mean.
Where the fuck
are you going,
Mia?
Mia?
Jesus?
It's a jungle
here.
In this
beautiful,
quiet place,
the shock of
the man's
voice,
his heavy
footsteps,
panting breath.
He has
followed
Mia here.
How?
She is
certain that
he'd gone to
bed.
She was safe
from him that
night.
She is in
despair.
Ferris has
followed her
to this
secret place
and defiled
it.
Laughing
in cruel
delight,
for indeed
Ferris is
drunk and
wanting to
punish.
Little
bitch,
what the
fuck do
you think
you are
doing?
Rudely,
the blinding
light pokes
at Mia's
face,
at her
chest,
her belly,
drops to
her groin.
Ferris is
very close
to Mia now.
She seems
incapable of
running from
him.
She is
suffused
with
dismay,
regret.
She has
betrayed
Meow Dao
and the
feral cats.
Has she?
She has
led this
terrible person
into their
secret place.
Ferris grabs
at Mia.
She throws
off his
hand,
which is a
mistake,
for Ferris
is easily
angered.
He is
sensitive about
being respected,
disrespected.
Mia whimpers
in pain.
He has
struck her
face with
the back
of his
hand,
not on
purpose.
Unless...
Yes,
he has
struck her
on purpose.
His intention
is to
intimidate her,
overpower her,
reduce her
to terror,
so that he
can run
his hands
over her,
throw her
onto the
marshy ground,
and push
himself between
her legs,
defeat her.
You
goddamn
dirty
girl.
Out of
the shadows,
a flash
of white,
a white-furred
creature
leaping,
sharp teeth,
bared.
There is a
strangled
scream.
With both
hands,
the man
tries to
push away
the furious
creature that
has attached
itself to
his throat.
It is the
size of a
large cat,
or a
lynx,
snarling,
growling.
As Mia
stares in
horror,
Meow Dao
leaps down
from the
man's
shoulders,
releasing him
to stagger
blindly,
fingers pressed
against his
neck in a
futile effort
to stave the
outpouring of
blood.
But the
man is
helpless.
The man
falls heavily.
All his
strength is
draining from
him.
Mia is
transfixed.
Mia sees
but cannot
stop what
is happening.
The slashed
carotid
artery,
the geyser
of dark
blood.
Is there
a moon?
A clouded
moon?
The flashlight
has fallen
into the
underbrush
and is
lost.
Mia
whimpers
in fear.
Mia
laughs,
a wild
cry of
a laugh.
Mia
rouses
herself.
Mia
rouses
herself to
run toward
the darkened
house.
Mia has
been cunning.
She has
not locked
herself out
of the
house but
fixed the
lock so
that the
door,
stealthily
shut behind
her,
did not
lock.
How quiet
the house
is.
Like a
house in
a dream
or at
the bottom
of the
sea.
Only
Mia's
sharp
breathing,
pounding
of her
heart.
Must
call
911.
Emergency?
Ambulance?
In the
kitchen,
cumbling for
the phone
against the
wall,
hesitant to
switch on
the overhead
lights,
Mia is
shivering and
whimpering to
herself as a
small child
might,
in a state
beyond terror
of pure
emotion,
sensual,
near to
unbearable.
Oh,
Mia.
Mia has
been very
quiet,
she is
certain.
Yet
Mia's
mother has
awakened and
has come
downstairs into
the kitchen,
in her
night clothes,
wraith-like,
but unflinching
and determined,
as if Mia's
mother has
sensed a
seismic shift
in the
night,
the very
foundation
beneath the
house,
shuddering.
Mia's
mother switches
on a single
bright light
above the
sink.
This
single light
is all
that is
required,
for there
is Mia
at the
sink,
in a
trance,
eyes dilated,
wearing a
raincoat over
her nightgown,
running hot
water from
the faucet,
scalding hot
water,
desperate to
rinse the
razor-sharp
Japanese knife
to remove
all stains.
Give it
here,
Mia.
The knife
is taken
from her
fingers.
Mia has
failed to
wash it
thoroughly,
of course.
Blood
traces would
remain on
the blade
and on
the carved
ebony
handle.
Deftly,
Mia's
mother gives
the knife
another swipe
or two
beneath the
faucet,
then places
it in the
dishwasher,
which is
two-thirds
full of
dishes and
silverware.
No problem
for Mia's
mother to
rapidly punch
in the
controls.
Sanitize.
Extra
rinse.
Set the
dishwasher
thrumming.
returning
then to
the
upstairs
of the
darkened
house,
to their
beds,
preparing
for the
next day
and the
next.
In the
kitchen,
all surfaces
gleaming.
When they
are questioned,
as of course
they must be
questioned,
there is not
much useful
information to
impart.
An utter
surprise,
shock,
no possible
explanation.
Yes,
he'd been
drinking.
Yes,
he was
often away
until the
early hours
of the
morning.
No,
his wife
knew nothing
of his
financial
affairs.
Yes,
he did
seem to
have
enemies.
The wife
thought they
might have
been business
associates,
but she
wasn't
certain,
for he'd
kept such
information
to himself.
No,
the
stepdaughter
had scarcely
known him.
No need
or wish for
the family
to move to
another
house?
Why?
Whatever
had happened
to the
stepdad
had not
happened
in the
house.
Whatever
had happened
to the
stepdad
had not
happened
to her.
Which is
why Mia's
sleep is
a deep,
dreamless
sleep.
Which is
why,
close beside
Mia,
Meow Dao
sleeps through
the night.
And why,
through all
the years
of Mia's
adolescence,
Mia and
Miau Dao
will be
inseparable.
