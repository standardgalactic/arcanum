Sapiens. A Brief History of Humankind.
Written by Summary Station.
Narrated by Melissa Fabregas.
Chapter 1
200,000 years ago, Homo sapiens first came into existence.
They preceded many other types of Homo species, such as Neanderthals and Homo erectus.
These different species of Homo lived in various parts throughout the planet,
from Africa to North America.
These different species have different qualities that they each need for the area that they live in.
Those that live in hotter climates near the equator have darker skin.
And those that live in colder areas have thicker hair and less of a susceptibility to cold weather.
Chapter 2
Monkeys have been around for millions of years, and some of these evolved to walk upright.
They did so over thousands of years, due to the advantage doing so gave.
It allowed primitive man to run faster, and use its hands much more effectively so it could carry weapons,
just sticks and stones at the time, and so that they can start to use their fingers for more intricate tasks,
such as shaping tools.
The fact that these early men learned to use their fingers in articulate ways,
it meant they couldn't use brute force like most other animals that were competing for food.
Instead, they had to use intelligence to get food and survive.
This led to development of the brain.
Chapter 3
Neanderthals had a much larger skull and forehead than Homo sapiens of the modern day,
as they had a larger brain.
This larger brain allowed them to gain intelligence and learn from their surrounding very quickly,
working out where the best berries grew,
and during what times of the year hunting each type of animal was best.
They survived by all having extensive knowledge of the local area,
which types of plants thrived during which time of the year,
and where to go to eat during seasons and various weathers.
As each individual of a pack needed to have this knowledge to survive,
they had a bigger brain to store this information.
Their brains are larger than ours today,
as now we do not need to store so much information for survival.
Nowadays, every person in society has a specialty in knowledge,
and this is all they are required to know.
A banker will know a lot about finances,
but how to find food or create clothing isn't a skill they need to know.
And therefore, brain power isn't required to be able to maintain these skills all at once.
Another reason for a smaller brain is energy use.
A larger brain uses more energy,
and our brains already use 30% of the energy we consume.
So larger brains use more energy,
and so require more food to sustain it.
Those with larger brains would be better at finding food,
but would ultimately need to hunt and search more for food,
almost making this greater brain power not worth the advantages.
Chapter 4
Along with bigger brains,
Homo sapiens also evolved to walk upright.
As described before,
this has many advantages.
However, we evolved to do this much faster than our bodies could keep up with,
and so it had to make many changes quickly.
We developed wider shoulders and smaller hips,
all making walking on two legs easier.
One of the problems with this is that it leads to our heads
not being level with our bodies as we sleep.
This means we can develop bad neck and back pain from sleeping,
which can hinder ability to move and forage for food during the day.
Instead,
Homo sapiens learn to sleep with their arms under their heads
to make them more comfortable.
Nowadays,
we have pillows and beds to support us,
but before this,
most humans had to live with sore backs and necks most of the time.
We also evolved to have smaller hips.
This allowed us more freedom of movement when walking,
however,
had a negative consequence.
Smaller hips
meant that when mothers were giving birth,
the baby had less of a chance of survival.
As the birth rate was lowered,
people started having more children,
so that at least some would survive to grow up and carry on the species
and help the elderly forage and eat.
This had a consequence that was unexpected.
As more births took place to combat more infant mortality,
the number in the population rose,
leading to tribes needing to get more food in total.
As they needed more food,
they needed more of a population to collect the food,
and it created a vicious cycle of growing population
and high births to combat the high infant mortality.
Chapter 5
Across the globe,
different species of Homo thrived in various climates and conditions.
Homo sapiens were the latest of the Homos to develop,
and are currently the only current ones surviving.
But why is this?
The main reason for this
seems to be mating between the species.
Homo sapiens mated with the other species of Homo,
or wiped the groups out if they were a threat.
After a while,
the stronger, more adapted genes of the Homo sapiens
outlived the less specific ones of the original species,
making it so currently only about 1 to 5%
of the genes of people from the area
the original species lived in
are similar to that group.
The groups may have also been a threat to the Homo sapiens,
and so they simply killed them
to ensure they had pick of the best food and places to live.
Chapter 6
When we first developed,
humans were not at the top of the food chain
as we are now.
We were instead somewhere in the middle,
preying on smaller animals,
though being hunted by larger animals
that could easily kill weak and small humans.
They survived by scavenging the remains of animals
killed by lions and other predators
once they had finished eating all the meat they wanted.
We grew our way up the food chain
by communication with one another,
being able to work together
to take down a large animal to eat
and defend against the attacks of large animals.
Although this took a lot of time to happen,
it happened much quicker
than evolution allowed us to adapt to this.
As a result,
our minds are not particularly built
to act in certain social ways
that our society forms around us,
which is one of the reasons
for the high rate of mental illness
in modern society.
Chapter 7
Many people say humans dominate animals
because we are stronger and cleverer than them.
However, this is not the case.
If we were to be attacked,
no intelligence would save us
from a strong animal,
and we are actually
the top of the food chain
for one reason.
Our ability to conceive concepts
that do not really exist.
If a tribe all believes in a similar thing,
be it a god
or even believing the tribe is an entity
and not a random group of people,
it gives them common ground
to work together
and trust one another to communicate.
One of the biggest examples of this
is religion.
If all people believe in something
that is not real
and is only imagined,
that group of people
will be kinder
and communicate more,
making them a more cohesive group.
Another example is countries.
Country borders and names
do not really exist,
but they are given names
and areas by humans.
The only reason they exist
is because people believe
that they exist.
If people cease to believe
in gravity one day,
it would still be here
and function.
However,
if they cease to believe
in America,
the concept of America
would no longer exist
and it would just be
a mass of land.
Money is one of these
imagined things
that hold society together.
We can function together
as we pay others
to do services for us
and they pay us
to do them for them.
If people stopped
believing in money,
it would just be
worthless paper
and metal coins.
However,
it works as a concept
as so many people
believe in it
and are adamant
it is worth something.
Chapter 8
One big example
of created institutions
is Peugeot.
They were created
as a company
that was started
as its separate identity
and so if someone
had a problem
with the product
they produced,
they would sue
the company itself,
not the owners.
In reality,
Peugeot does not exist.
It is not a physical entity,
but it is treated
as though it is
so it can be sued
and taken to court.
This has been done
to many companies
in the past
and many
will be sued
in the future.
This principle
allows humans
to provide one another
with services
and products
that further our society
and ability
to conquer the world
so we can spread out
genes
as efficiently
as possible.
Chapter 9
This system
works well
to build a society
of people
that accept it
and do not destroy
the system
as the majority
does believe in it.
This creates
a stable
and useful system
for society
and teamwork.
Before these concepts
came into being,
the first ones
were very basic
but allowed tribes
to work together,
defend each other,
and hunt effectively.
If two tribes
near each other
had the same beliefs,
they may work together
or mate together,
creating a stable system
and a diverse population.
In this way,
humans climb to the top
of the food chain
by working together
and combining skills
and strengths
to dominate anything
that questioned
their power.
Chapter 10
By working together
and combining knowledge
of farming
and cultivation
of food,
the first farms
were created.
They found that
if they planted
certain plants
at certain times
of the year,
they would make
a harvest
at the same time,
and all kinds
of plants
could be grown
to provide food
all year round.
This led to the formation
of large farming communities
all working together
to create as much food
as possible
to feed everyone,
and also to provide
enough food
to last them
if one crop failed.
The workers worked
as hard as possible
to make sure
that this happened,
and everyone
in the new village
was expected
to work every day
and work hard
to make sure
food was in good supply.
Chapter 11
Unfortunately,
this had consequences
that the inhabitants
did not think of,
as they did not think
beyond the next year's harvest.
As everybody worked hard
to get the work done,
and they had more children
so that there were
more workers available,
villages became crowded.
These are the places
that the first real examples
of disease are seen.
Disease did obviously exist
before this time,
however not at this level.
The inhabitants
all lived in close proximity,
and so any disease
could be spread easily
between inhabitants,
and as they were all
working very hard,
their immune systems
were weakened
to the point of vulnerability.
The first inhabited villages
also had little
in the way of hygiene,
with many of them
just dumping waste
onto the floor
outside of homes,
as they did not know
that this created
a living condition
for diseases
and microbes to thrive.
Although the amount
of food had been increased,
living conditions
became gradually
worse and worse.
Disease was rife,
and villages were overcrowded
and not comfortable
to live in.
People had barely
the right amount of food
as the population
was so high.
Though evolutionarily,
this was ideal.
Our population
was increasing,
and our genes
were being spread
the most amount
possible by the large
birth rate.
And so naturally,
we fell into creating
and promoting
these conditions.
On a personal level,
we were in the most
uncomfortable time
in the history of man,
due to the fact
that everyone was starving
and worked
until they died.
an example of this
occurring in another animal
is in livestock.
They are bred to be eaten
and live short lives
until they are killed,
but they are at the
greatest number
that there ever
has been of them.
Evolutionary-wise,
they are a successful animal.
However,
they live in bad conditions
and are killed young
for food,
for a greater
and more dominant
evolutionary success.
humans were at this level,
however,
were not being eaten
as livestock is,
at this time,
and started to move
out of this phase
many,
many years after.
Chapter 12
One of the first places
to move away
from the structure
of large villages
of people helping
each other grow food,
a high death rate,
and uncomfortable lives,
was in what is now
Egypt.
The Egyptian Empire
was the first civilization
to grow into existence
in the world
from very small beginnings.
It all started
by the River Nile,
a large river
running through Egypt.
Every few months,
the river floods
onto its banks,
and the local farmers
had calculated
when it did this
by watching the cycles
of the moon
and could tell
when it was going
to happen next.
This was important
for them,
as when it flooded,
it made the soil
in their fields
where they grew food
very fertile
and easy to grow crops in.
This created
a large population
in this area,
and farming
was successfully
feeding them
until they created
a huge settlement.
This was around
3200 B.C.,
and the civilization
lasted until 30 B.C.,
where it fell
to the Romans
when being ruled
by Cleopatra.
Chapter 13
The Egyptian Empire's
beginning came
from this group
of settlements.
Many fought
to lead the large
amount of people
in the settlement,
as they would be
the person
that would ensure
everyone working
got the same amount
of food
and no one
was keeping
any extra
for themselves.
Those that led
did not have to work,
as it was their job
to ensure
that those that worked
did it well.
As these tribes
formed with leaders,
they looked to invade
and take over
other tribes
to ensure
that they had
the best land
and the best workers
possible.
This led to villages
extending into others,
and it formed
into one large area
full of many
thousands of people,
a large population
for the number
of people
that were alive
at the time.
This large group
was led
by one leader,
the Pharaoh.
Over time,
the Pharaoh
grew from the leader
of the small village
to the leader
of larger
and larger settlements,
until the point
where his reign
could not be questioned
by other settlements,
due to how large
the group of men
willing to fight
for him was.
Chapter 14
As this civilization
grew,
the power
of the Pharaoh
grew.
The inhabitants
of the ruled-over reign
believed the Pharaoh
to be the true leader
and that he deserved
to be in this position
of power,
when in fact
he does not,
and if all of the people
decided not to believe
in the power,
he would not be able
to do anything about it.
Then he would no longer
have any actual power.
No other animal
but humans
could believe
one person
has so much power
that they can control
such a large group,
and the Pharaoh himself
also believed this.
Many Pharaohs
claimed themselves
to be gods,
and were thus
treated as such.
Chapter 15
This gave rise
to another phenomenon
that is in place
now
that makes us
stronger as a group.
People began
to develop professions
and skills
specific to them,
and the exchange
of goods and services
for food
became a key part
of the society.
This led to not
everyone needing
to farm,
so the services
and foods
increased in quality,
as those that made
and grew them
were skilled
in only one area,
and so were
the best at it.
This made the need
for a thing
that the product
you create
can be exchanged for.
Money was the solution
to this.
Certain coins
meant that you
had given in
a certain amount
of food or services,
and could be exchanged
later on
for something
that you need
in the future.
Chapter 16
Money is one
of the most
important concepts
that created
the civilizations
that humans live in.
It made it equal
to provide services
and food,
so that it wasn't
just farmers
that were the highest
valued citizens.
Those that had
the most money
also were seen
as the highest
in society,
as they could afford
the most food
and whatever they wanted,
a concept that
didn't exist
before money.
This created
the hierarchy
that exists
to this day,
though is significantly
more complicated now.
There is no other
animal that even
comes close
to using money,
a thing we use
every day
without a single thought,
and it has been
a large player
in our society's
advancements.
Chapter 17
Art is the way
to easily see
Homo's way
of imagining
something that
is not there.
The first examples
of art come
from around
100,000
to 50,000
years ago.
They show things
that the people
around them
would have seen,
or situations
that could have
happened,
showing they could
recall events
that have happened
before as pictures
in their mind,
allowing them to
draw it on the
walls of caves
or rocks.
The first example
of art that is
created entirely
in the mind
of the Homo's
is a carving
of a woman
with the head
of a wolf-type
animal.
This clearly
did not exist,
however,
it was created
by man,
just from what
they could imagine
and possibly
what they believed
as a type of religion
or belief
of a group of people.
This is extremely
important as evidence
that Neanderthals
and other early
Homo species
thought in a similar
way to us.
This means we can
apply some aspects
of our thought process
to them
and have an idea
as to why they
did certain things
or how they dealt
with certain problems.
It also shows
how much we have
evolved over time,
with the difference
in this imagination
being very little
and visual differences
only being minimal
as well.
Chapter 18
In addition to imagination,
another key factor
led to our species'
dominance over the world,
and that is complex language.
Many animals have
some form of communication,
which could even be
classified as language.
They have sounds
that specify
certain dangers or foods,
and to initiate
mating and fights.
Some animals,
such as dolphins,
have very complex
communication systems,
and can convey
complex messages
and communicate
about things
they have not seen
or communicated
about before,
demonstrating some
kind of flexibility
in their language.
Humans evolved
beyond this simple system,
and can convey
information about
the world around us,
as well as us ourselves.
We can also discuss
things with one another,
which allows us
to combine ideas
to solve problems,
or make something
a lot better.
This advanced
our farming techniques,
and also child care
and protection
amongst a tribe,
before we started farming.
This advancement
made us better
and stronger as a team,
and so left us vulnerable
not only to other animals,
but also to the environment
and weather,
as they could work
together to stay warm
and look after crops
as best as possible.
Chapter 19
Currently there are
between 5,000
and 7,000 languages
in the world,
as different languages
developed in different
areas of the world.
Most languages
have roots in one area
that spread,
usually having the beginnings
of all of the languages
in one tribe of people.
There are some
that do not fit
in the so-called
language families
that originated
in their own areas
of the world.
This shows that the language
those that lived
at the beginning
of the time of farming
must have been
relatively complex.
Not as complex
as language is now,
however.
This is because language
can progress very quickly,
and so would have done
even hundreds
hundreds of thousands
of years ago.
Chapter 20
The best way we have
to study the culture
and behavior
of these tribes
of Homo species
and early Homo sapiens
is by looking at
recently discovered tribes
that lived in forests
and jungles
like the Amazon.
They have lived there
for hundreds of thousands
of years,
and have not expanded
into a large civilization
like the majority
of mankind,
and have instead
lived as they did
originally,
without much
in terms of social development.
When a new tribe
is found,
they are researched
before any contact
is made
to see how they behave,
so this information
can be used
in contrast
to these ancient
Homo species.
Many of these tribes
have been found
over the years,
and they have been
extremely diverse
in behavior.
Matriarchal
and patriarchal societies
have been found,
though most have a system
in which each member
of the tribe
is equal in importance,
as long as they contribute
something to the group.
This diversity
is important,
as it shows
that the original tribes
would have lived
separate lives
and developed
different cultures.
This could potentially
explain why
Homo sapiens
killed other
Homo species,
as they could not
understand their
culture and behavior.
We have to be careful
when making contact
with these people,
as they have not
developed an immunity
to diseases
that we can carry.
Chapter 21
Some of the actions
of these tribes
have surprised us.
In one tribe,
if a child annoys
an elder,
they can kill
that child.
This is not seen
as mean or unacceptable,
as the child is seen
to have to show
respect for everyone,
and rarely happens
as children learn
respect early.
It is common in tribes
to kill children
that are not needed,
or when there are
already too many children.
This keeps the population
at a level
where it can be fed,
and ensures growth
only when it can be sustained,
and not when it puts
the tribe at danger.
This sort of behavior
is best for sustaining
a small population,
and is thought to be
what the first tribes
would have done
to be able to survive
and evolve
to the point
our society is at today.
Chapter 22
One of the next biggest steps
in human development
after the agricultural revolution
was the industrial revolution.
This is the point
that most things
we could already do
by hand
required less effort,
and by using machines,
we ensured
better quality products.
This marked the shift
from rural to urban living,
and an increase
in life quality for some,
and a significant decrease
in quality for others.
Income started to grow
consistently,
and with it
population grew,
and has not slowed
since this time,
no matter the quality
of the year for harvest,
or other factors
that would have otherwise
affected population.
By 1830,
three improvements
were made in key technologies,
and this paved the way
for the industrial revolution.
The first of these
was textile manufacturing.
The loom increased
the average output
from one worker
by times 40,
allowing them
to make clothing
and other textiles
as quickly
and efficiently as possible,
driving down the price.
The second was steam power,
which was developed
to use a tenth
of the fuel
that had been used before,
so we became
more efficient
at powering machines
and factories
to do work
a human could not.
Iron making
was also increased
in efficiency,
so iron was stronger
and cheaper than ever.
This led to iron
being used
in many products,
and it became useful
in many situations.
chapter 23.
The industrial revolution
and these advancements
led to an increase
in the average
life expectancy
and lowered infant mortality
for a few reasons.
Firstly,
the price of food
was lowered
by the cheaper
and easier production
of it,
and so malnutrition
became much rarer
as it was common
before the revolution.
Clothing also
became much easier
to get hold of,
so illness from cold
became much rarer also.
Chapter 24.
The industrial revolution
also brought many negatives,
and many historians argue
that it was worse
for human society
and living conditions
than before.
The biggest problem
came from overcrowding
as a result
of the large expansion
of cities and towns.
This caused
a faster spread
of disease
as everyone
was in closer proximity.
This faster spread
caused many more people
to fall ill
and meant that
many families
had as many children
as possible,
so there was a chance
one of them
wouldn't die young
and could sustain
the family by working.
This also increased
the people's ability
to fight disease,
and across this time,
the human immune system
made the biggest jumps
in evolutionary history.
It also changed
the society
that many humans
were in.
A hierarchy
was established
that put people
at different levels,
so some had to do
the work
to sustain
the whole population.
However,
a select few
did not have to do
much work at all,
and instead
were in charge of
and paid others
to do the work
for them,
and it was these people
that profited
and lived the best lives
because of this.
This new social structure
was created
to ensure
that those that are working
are controlled
to do the tasks
they need to do
to ensure survival
of the whole population.
This social structure
relies on those
at the top
being honest,
while the rest
were working as hard
as they possibly could.
Unfortunately,
this was not the case.
All animals
are genetically inclined
to want to pass
on their genes,
and so those
at the top
found the money
and power
they possessed
made them more
attractive mates
to the opposite sex.
This led to them
passing on their genes
over poorer workers.
Because of this,
it became a power struggle
to see who would be
at the top
and reproduce the most,
a concept that had
been around
for a long time.
as long as tribes
had existed.
Now,
leadership and money
could be gained
on your own terms
and through hard work.
Chapter 25
Another aspect
of the human condition
that was brought out
especially by
the Industrial Revolution
was our ability
to kill one another
in new and exciting ways.
Guns and bombs
could be mass-produced
to be used in wars
and take lands
in other countries
so the empire
that existed
could expand faster
and more efficiently.
This increased
efficiency to kill
made natural selection
take a turn.
Instead of the best mate
being the one best
at finding food
and the toughest,
it is the person
who can handle
weapons the best.
This signifies
the change in society
started the human's ability
to wage war
and kill one another.
For a species
that's aim
is to pass
its genes along,
humans have developed
beyond defending
themselves to be the best
and moved on
to actively killing
others to become
the best.
We have advanced
to keeping the largest
distance possible
from our opponents
to kill them,
from spears
to guns,
and then
onto bombs
and planes
which can kill
as effectively
as possible.

To match
the written text,
it has also been omitted
from the audio production.
No content
is missing.
Chapter 27
On a positive note,
one of the biggest
advancements
in human history
has been the advancement
in writing.
It has allowed us
to track
all factors
in society
as well as
express ourselves
to others
and anyone we want.
Language was first
developed as a way
of recording
any monetary
transactions
between people
so that they could
be later checked
to make sure
both parties
held both parts
of their deal.
This type of writing
could not express
feelings or expressions,
and many civilizations
did not see a need
for this.
This slowly developed
across different civilizations
into the type of writing
that we know now
and use every day.
This became necessary
as it meant
information
concerning anything
could be expressed
across huge distances
and between
complete strangers.
Analysis
The human race
developed from
a complex background.
Different types
of Homo evolved
depending on the area
that they lived in.
Neanderthals developed
in the hotter
climates of the earth
and are adapted
best for this climate.
And other Homo's
are best suited
for the places
they are found
the most.
After millions
of years,
Homo sapiens
started to expand
over the globe,
mating
and killing
the local
Homo species
until it was
Homo sapiens
that dominated
the earth.
This can be seen
in those native
to different areas
of the earth now,
who possess
around 1-5%
of the genes
of those Homo's
from that area.
Once Homo sapiens
were spread
around the earth,
a variety of changes
happened
over many thousands
of years,
so they became
adapted to
finding food
and functioning
as a society.
Homo sapiens
moved from
the middle
of the food chain
to the top
as they possess
a skill
no other animal
does,
the ability
to imagine
concepts
and scenarios.
This means
that humans
can have
a common bond
with any other
person
without having
met them before,
just because
they believe
in the same God
or the strength
of the tribe.
Another advantage
the Homo sapiens
had was the ability
to communicate
through language
and writing.
Language allowed
humans to contact
and connect
with one another,
and this allowed
them to be more
caring to one another.
It also allowed
them to work together
and swap ideas,
so that advancements
were made quickly
with the help
of everyone.
Writing came along
after language,
and at first
was designed
to only be used
in matters of food
and land swapping
as a record
of what had happened
so people could not
lie to one another.
At this time,
it could not be used
to express feelings
or thoughts,
and so this developed
slowly across
many different cultures
who saw a need
for this.
This writing
has allowed humans
to share feelings
and, most importantly,
knowledge with one another,
so that information
can be expanded upon
by as many people
as possible.
There were two
important areas
in human history
that made us
to be like we are now
in societal terms,
and they are
the agricultural
and industrial revolution.
These two eras
are where our ability
to farm food
and industry
came from.
The first
was a gradual process
that happened
when humans
figured out the rate
which foods
and crops grew at
and how to look
after them properly.
The second
happened very quickly
when huge advancements
in steam power
allowed humans
to make iron
and textiles
at an increased rate.
Homo sapiens
have many advantages
when it comes
to being the most
dominant animal
on earth,
though individually
we are weak
and drop back down
to the middle
of the food chain.
Only through communication
and bonding
with others
can we truly
be as effective
at survival
as we have become
and originally were.
Thanks for reading.
