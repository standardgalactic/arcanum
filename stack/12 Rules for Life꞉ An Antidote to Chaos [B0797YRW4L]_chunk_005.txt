hell, that the difference is not worth discussing, and the opposite of hell is heaven. To place the
alleviation of unnecessary pain and suffering at the pinnacle of your hierarchy of value
is to work to bring about the kingdom of God on earth. That's a state and a state of mind
at the same time. Jung observed that the construction of such a moral hierarchy was
inevitable, although it could remain poorly arranged and internally self-contradictory.
For Jung, whatever was at the top of an individual's moral hierarchy was, for all
intents and purposes, that person's ultimate value, that person's God. It was what the person acted out.
It was what the person believed most deeply. Something enacted is not a fact or even a set of
facts. Instead, it's a personality. Or, more precisely, a choice between two opposing personalities.
It's Sherlock Holmes or Moriarty. It's Batman or the Joker. It's Superman or Lex Luthor. Charles Francis
Xavier or Magneto. And Thor or Loki. It's Abel or Cain. And it's Christ or Satan. If it's working for
the ennobling of being, for the establishment of paradise, then it's Christ. If it's working for
the destruction of being, for the generation and propagation of unnecessary suffering and pain,
then it's Satan. That's the inescapable archetypal reality.
Expedience is the following of blind impulse. It's short-term gain. It's narrow and selfish.
It lies to get its way. It takes nothing into account. It's immature and irresponsible.
Meaning is its mature replacement. Meaning emerges when impulses are regulated, organized,
and unified. Meaning emerges from the interplay between the possibilities of the world and the
value structure operating within that world. If the value structure is aimed at the betterment of
being, the meaning revealed will be life-sustaining. It will provide the antidote for chaos and suffering.
It will make everything matter. It will make everything better.
If you act properly, your actions allow you to be psychologically integrated now and tomorrow and
into the future, while you benefit yourself, your family, and the broader world around you.
Everything will stack up and align along a single axis. Everything will come together. This produces
maximal meaning. This stacking up is a place in space and time whose existence we can detect with our
ability to experience more than is simply revealed here and now by our senses, which are obviously limited
to their information-gathering and representational capacity. Meaning trumps expedience. Meaning gratifies
all impulses, now and forever. That's why we can detect it.
If you decide that you are not justified in your resentment of being, despite its inequity and pain,
you may come to notice things you could fix to reduce, even by a bit, some unnecessary pain and suffering.
You may come to ask yourself, what should I do today? In a manner that means, how could I use my time
to make things better instead of worse? Such tasks may announce themselves as the pile of undone paperwork
that you could attend to, the room that you could make a bit more welcoming, or the meal that could be
a bit more delicious and more gratefully delivered to your family.
You may find that if you attend to these moral obligations, once you have placed make-the-world-better
at the top of your value hierarchy, you experience ever-deepening meaning.
It's not bliss. It's not happiness.
It is something more like atonement for the criminal fact of your fractured and damaged being.
It's payment of the debt you owe for the insane and horrible miracle of your existence.
It's how you remember the Holocaust.
It's how you make amends for the pathology of history.
It's adoption of the responsibility for being a potential denizen of hell.
It is willingness to serve as an angel of paradise.
Expedience. That's hiding all the skeletons in the closet.
That's covering the blood you just spilled with a carpet.
That's avoiding responsibility.
It's cowardly and shallow and wrong.
It's wrong because mere expedience, multiplied by many repetitions, produces the character of a demon.
It's wrong because expedience merely transfers the curse on your head to someone else or to your future self
in a manner that will make your future and the future generally worse instead of better.
There is no faith and no courage and no sacrifice in doing what is expedient.
There is no careful observation that actions and presuppositions matter or that the world is made of what matters.
To have meaning in your life is better than to have what you want because you may neither know what you want nor what you truly need.
Meaning is something that comes upon you of its own accord.
You can set up the preconditions.
You can follow meaning when it manifests itself.
But you cannot simply produce it as an act of will.
Meaning signifies that you are in the right place, at the right time,
properly balanced between order and chaos, where everything lines up as best it can at that moment.
What is expedient works only for the moment.
It's immediate, impulsive, and limited.
What is meaningful, by contrast, is the organization of what would otherwise merely be expedient into a symphony of being.
Meaning is what is put forth more powerfully than mere words can express by Beethoven's Ode to Joy.
A triumphant, bringing forth from the void of pattern after pattern upon beautiful pattern,
every instrument playing its part, disciplined voices layered on top of that,
spanning the entire breadth of human emotion from despair to exhilaration.
Meaning is what manifests itself when the many levels of being arrange themselves into a perfectly functioning harmony,
from atomic microcosm to cell to organ to individual to society to nature to cosmos,
so that action at each level beautifully and perfectly facilitates action at all,
such that past, present, and future are all at once redeemed and reconciled.
Meaning is what emerges beautifully and profoundly,
like a newly formed rosebud opening itself out of nothingness into the light of sun and god.
Meaning is the lotus striving upward through the dark, late depths through the ever-clearing water,
blooming forth on the very surface,
revealing within itself the golden Buddha himself perfectly integrated,
such that the revelation of the divine will can make itself manifest in his every word and gesture.
Meaning is when everything there is comes together in an ecstatic dance of single purpose,
the glorification of a reality,
so that no matter how good it has suddenly become,
it can get better and better and better,
more and more deeply,
forever into the future.
Meaning happens when that dance has become so intense
that all the horrors of the past,
all the terrible struggle engaged in by all of life and all of humanity to that moment,
becomes a necessary and worthwhile part of the increasingly successful attempt
to build something truly mighty and good.
Meaning is the ultimate balance between,
on the one hand,
the chaos of transformation and possibility,
and on the other,
the discipline of pristine order,
whose purpose is to produce out of the attendant chaos
a new order that will be even more immaculate
and capable of bringing forth
a still more balanced and productive chaos and order.
Meaning is the way,
the path of life more abundant,
the place you live
when you are guided by love
and speaking truth
and when nothing you want
or could possibly want
takes any precedence over precisely that.
Do what is meaningful,
not what is expedient.
Rule 8
Tell the truth
Or, at least,
don't lie
Truth in no man's land
I trained to become a clinical psychologist at McGill University in Montreal.
While doing so,
I sometimes met my classmates on the grounds of Montreal's Douglas Hospital,
where we had our first direct experiences with the mentally ill.
The Douglas occupies acres of land and dozens of buildings.
Many are connected by underground tunnels
to protect workers and patients from the interminable Montreal winters.
The hospital once sheltered hundreds of long-term in-house patients.
This was before anti-psychotic drugs
and the large-scale deinstitutionalization movements of the late 60s
all but closed down the residential asylums,
most often dooming the now freed patients
to a much harder life on the streets.
By the early 80s,
when I first visited the grounds,
all but the most seriously afflicted residents had been discharged.
Those who remained were strange, much-damaged people.
They clustered around the vending machines,
scattered throughout the hospital's tunnels.
They looked as if they had been photographed by Diane Arbus
or painted by Hieronymus Bosch.
One day, my classmates and I were all standing in line.
We were awaiting further instruction
from the straight-laced German psychologist
who ran the Douglas clinical training program.
A long-term inpatient, fragile and vulnerable,
approached one of the other students,
a sheltered, conservative young woman.
The patient spoke to her in a friendly, childlike manner
and asked,
Why are you all standing here?
What are you doing?
Can I come along with you?
My classmate turned to me and asked, uncertainly,
What should I say to her?
She was taken aback, just as I was,
by this request,
coming from someone so isolated and hurt.
Neither of us wanted to say anything
that might be construed as a rejection or reprimand.
We had temporarily entered a kind of no-man's land
in which society offers no ground rules or guidance.
We were new clinical students,
unprepared to be confronted on the grounds
of a mental hospital by a schizophrenic patient
asking a naive, friendly question
about the possibility of social belonging.
The natural conversational give-and-take
between people attentive to contextual cues
was not happening here either.
What exactly were the rules in such a situation,
far outside the boundaries of normal social interaction?
What exactly were the options?
There were only two,
as far as I could quickly surmise.
I could tell the patient a story
designed to save everyone's face,
or I could answer truthfully.
We can only take eight people in our group,
would have fallen into the first category,
as would have,
We are just leaving the hospital now.
Neither of these answers
would have bruised any feelings,
at least on the surface,
and the presence of the status differences
that divided us from her
would have gone unremarked.
But neither answer would have been exactly true.
So, I didn't offer either.
I told the patient as simply and directly as I could
that we were new students,
training to be psychologists,
and that she couldn't join us for that reason.
The answer highlighted the distinction
between her situation and ours,
making the gap between us greater and more evident.
The answer was harsher
than a well-crafted white lie.
But I already had an inkling
that untruth, however well meant,
can produce unintended consequences.
She looked crestfallen and hurt,
but only for a moment.
Then she understood,
and it was all right.
That was just how it was.
I had had a strange set of experiences
a few years before embarking
upon my clinical training.
I found myself subject
to some rather violent compulsions,
none acted upon,
and developed the conviction,
in consequence,
that I really knew rather little
about who I was
and what I was up to.
So, I began paying much closer attention
to what I was doing
and saying.
The experience was disconcerting,
to say the least.
I soon divided myself into two parts,
one that spoke
and one, more detached,
that paid attention
and judged.
I soon came to realize
that almost everything I said
was untrue.
I had motives
for saying these things.
I wanted to win arguments
and gain status
and impress people
and get what I wanted.
I was using language
to bend and twist the world
into delivering
what I thought was necessary.
But I was a fake.
Realizing this,
I started to practice
only saying things
that the internal voice
would not object to.
I started to practice
telling the truth,
or, at least,
not lying.
I soon learned
that such a skill
came in very handy
when I didn't know
what to do.
What should you do
when you don't know
what to do?
Tell the truth.
So, that's what I did
my first day
at the Douglas Hospital.
Later,
I had a client
who was paranoid
and dangerous.
Working with paranoid people
is challenging.
They believe
they have been targeted
by mysterious
conspiratorial forces
working malevolently
behind the scenes.
Paranoid people
are hyper-alert
and hyper-focused.
They are attending
to nonverbal cues
with an intentness
never manifest
during ordinary
human interactions.
They make mistakes
in interpretation.
That's the paranoia.
But they are still
almost uncanny
in their ability
to detect mixed motives,
judgment,
and falsehood.
You have to listen
very carefully
and tell the truth
if you're going to get
a paranoid person
to open up to you.
I listened carefully
and spoke truthfully
to my client.
Now and then,
he would describe
blood-curdling fantasies
of flaying people
for revenge.
I would watch
how I was reacting.
I paid attention
to what thoughts
and images emerged
in the theater
of my imagination
while he spoke
and I told him
what I observed.
I was not trying
to control
or direct
his thoughts
or actions
or mine.
I was only trying
to let him know
as transparently
as I could
how what he was doing
was directly affecting
at least one person.
Me.
My careful attention
and frank responses
did not mean at all
that I remained
unperturbed,
let alone approved.
I told him
when he scared me
often
that his words
and behavior
were misguided
and that he was going
to get into
serious trouble.
He talked to me
nonetheless
because I listened
and responded honestly
even though I was not
encouraging
in my responses.
He trusted me
despite
or more accurately
because of my objections.
He was paranoid
not stupid.
He knew his behavior
was socially unacceptable.
He knew that
any decent person
was likely to react
with horror
to his insane fantasies.
He trusted me
and would talk to me
because that's how
I reacted.
There was no chance
of understanding him
without that trust.
Trouble for him
generally started
in a bureaucracy
such as a bank.
He would enter
an institution
and attempt
some simple task.
He was looking
to open an account
or pay a bill
or fix some mistake.
Now and then
he encountered
the kind of
non-helpful person
that everyone
encounters
now and then
in such a place.
That person
would reject
the ID he offered
or require
some information
that was unnecessary
and difficult
to obtain.
Sometimes,
I suppose,
the bureaucratic
runaround
was unavoidable
but sometimes
it was unnecessarily
complicated
by petty misuses
of bureaucratic power.
My client
was very attuned
to such things.
He was obsessed
with honor.
It was more important
to him than safety,
freedom,
or belonging.
Following that logic,
because paranoid people
are impeccably logical,
he could never
allow himself
to be demeaned,
insulted,
or put down
even a little bit
by anyone.
Water did not
roll off his back.
Because of his rigid
and inflexible attitude,
my client's actions
had already been subjected
to several restraining orders.
Restraining orders
worked best,
however,
with the sort of person
who would never
require a restraining order.
I will be
your worst nightmare
was his phrase
of choice
in such situations.
I have wished
intensely
that I could say
something like that
after encountering
unnecessary
bureaucratic obstacles,
but it's generally
best to let
such things go.
My client
meant what he said,
however,
and sometimes
he really did
become someone's nightmare.
He was the bad guy
in no country
for old men.
He was the person
you meet
in the wrong place
at the wrong time.
If you messed with him,
even accidentally,
he was going
to stalk you,
remind you
what you had done,
and scare
the living daylights
out of you.
He was no one
to lie to.
I told him the truth,
and that cooled him off.
My landlord
I had a landlord
around that time
who'd been president
of a local biker gang.
My wife,
Tammy,
and I lived
next door to him
in his parents'
small apartment building.
His girlfriend
bore the marks
of self-inflicted injuries
characteristic
of borderline
personality disorder.
She killed herself
while we lived there.
Denis,
large,
strong,
French-Canadian
with a gray beard,
was a gifted
amateur electrician.
He had some
artistic talent,
too,
and was supporting
himself making
laminated wood posters
with custom neon lights.
He was trying
to stay sober
after being released
from jail.
Still,
every month or so,
he would disappear
on a days-long bender.
He was one of those men
who have a miraculous
capacity for alcohol.
He could drink
fifty or sixty beer
in a two-day binge
and remain standing
the whole time.
This may seem hard
to believe,
but it's true.
I was doing research
on familial alcoholism
at the time,
and it was not rare
for my subjects
to report
their father's
habitual consumption
of forty ounces
of vodka a day.
These patriarchs
would buy one bottle
every afternoon,
Monday through Friday,
and then two on Saturday
to tide them over
through this Sunday
liquor store closure.
Denis had a little dog.
Sometimes,
Tammy and I
would hear Denis
and the dog
out in the backyard
at four in the morning
during one of Denis's
marathon drinking sessions,
both of them
howling madly
at the moon.
Now and then,
on occasions like that,
Denis would drink up
every cent he had saved.
Then he would show up
at our apartment.
We would hear
a knock at night.
Denis would be
at the door,
swaying precipitously,
upright,
and miraculously conscious.
He would be
standing there,
toaster,
microwave,
or poster in hand.
He wanted to sell
these to me
so he could keep
on drinking.
I bought a few
things like this,
pretending that I
was being charitable.
Eventually,
Tammy convinced me
that I couldn't
do it anymore.
It made her nervous,
and it was bad
for Denis,
whom she liked.
Reasonable,
and even necessary
as her request was.
It still placed me
in a tricky position.
What do you say
to a severely
intoxicated,
violence-prone,
ex-biker gang
president
with patchy English
when he tries
to sell his microwave
to you
at your open door
at two in the morning?
This was a question
even more difficult
than those presented
by the institutionalized
patient
or the paranoid
flayer.
But the answer
was the same.
The truth.
But you'd bloody well
better know
what the truth is.
Denis knocked again
soon after my wife
and I had talked.
He looked at me
in the direct,
skeptical,
narrow-eyed manner
characteristic
of the tough,
heavy-drinking man
who is no stranger
to trouble.
That look means
prove your innocence.
Weaving slightly
back and forth,
he asked,
politely,
if I might be interested
in purchasing his toaster.
I rid myself
to the bottom
of my soul
of primate dominance
motivations
and moral superiority.
I told him,
as directly
and carefully
as I could,
that I would not.
I was playing
no tricks.
In that moment,
I wasn't an educated,
anglophone,
fortunate,
upwardly mobile
young man.
He wasn't an
ex-con Quebecois biker
with a blood-alcohol
level of 0.24.
No,
we were two men
of goodwill
trying to help
each other out
in our common struggle
to do the right thing.
I said that he had told me
he was trying
to quit drinking.
I said that it would
not be good for him
if I provided him
with more money.
I said that he made
Tammy,
whom he respected,
nervous
when he came over
so drunk
and so late
and tried to sell me things.
He glared
seriously at me
without speaking
for about
fifteen seconds.
That was
plenty long enough.
He was watching,
I knew,
for any micro-expression
revealing sarcasm,
deceit,
contempt,
or self-congratulation.
But I had thought
it through carefully
and I had only
said things
I truly meant.
I had chosen
my words
carefully,
traversing
a treacherous swamp,
feeling out
a partially
submerged
stone path.
Denis turned
and left.
Not only that,
he remembered
our conversation
despite his state
of professional
level intoxication.
He didn't try
to sell me
anything again.
Our relationship,
which was quite good
given the great
cultural gaps
between us,
became even
more solid.
Taking the easy
way out
or telling the truth?
Those are not
merely two
different choices.
They are different
pathways through life.
They are utterly
different ways
of existing.
Manipulate the world.
You can use words
to manipulate
the world
into delivering
what you want.
This is what it means
to act politically.
This is spin.
It's the specialty
of unscrupulous
marketers,
salesmen,
advertisers,
pick-up artists,
slogan-possessed
utopians,
and psychopaths.
It's the speech
people engage in
when they attempt
to influence
and manipulate
others.
It's what university
students do
when they write
an essay
to please
the professor
instead of
articulating
and clarifying
their own ideas.
It's what
everyone does
when they want
something
and decide
to falsify
themselves
to please
and flatter.
It's scheming
and sloganeering
and propaganda.
To conduct
life like this
is to become
possessed
by some
ill-formed
desire
and then to
craft speech
and action
in a manner
that appears
likely,
rationally,
to bring about
that end.
Typical
calculated
ends might
include
to impose
my ideological
beliefs,
to prove
that I am
or was
right,
to appear
competent,
to ratchet
myself up
the dominance
hierarchy,
to avoid
responsibility
or its twin
to garner
credit
for others'
actions,
to be
promoted,
to attract
the lion's
share of
attention,
to ensure
that everyone
likes me,
to garner
the benefits
of martyrdom,
to justify
my cynicism,
to rationalize
my antisocial
outlook,
to minimize
immediate
conflict,
to maintain
my naivete,
to capitalize
on my
vulnerability,
to always
appear as
the sainted
one,
or,
this one is
particularly
evil,
to ensure
that it is
always my
unloved
child's
fault.
These are
all examples
of what
Sigmund Freud's
compatriot,
the lesser
known Austrian
psychologist
Alfred Adler,
called
life lies.
Someone
living a
life lie
is attempting
to manipulate
reality with
perception,
thought,
and action,
so that only
some narrowly
desired and
predefined outcome
is allowed to
exist.
A life lived
in this manner
is based,
consciously or
unconsciously,
on two
premises.
The first
is that
current knowledge
is sufficient
to define
what is good,
unquestioningly,
far into the
future.
The second
is that
reality would
be unbearable
if left to
its own
devices.
The first
presumption is
philosophically
unjustifiable.
What you are
currently aiming
at might not
be worth
attaining,
just as what
you are
currently doing
might be
an error.
The second
is even
worse.
It is valid
only if
reality is
intrinsically
intolerable
and,
simultaneously,
something that
can be
successfully
manipulated
and distorted.
Such speaking
and thinking
requires the
arrogance and
certainty that
the English
poet John
Milton's
genius
identified
with Satan,
God's
highest angel,
gone most
spectacularly
wrong.
The faculty
of rationality
inclines
dangerously
to pride.
All I
know
is all
that needs
to be
known.
Pride falls
in love
with its own
creations
and tries
to make
them absolute.
I have
seen people
define their
utopia and
then bend
their lives
into knots
trying to
make it
reality.
A left-leaning
student adopts
a trendy,
anti-authority
stance and
spends the
next 20
years working
resentfully to
topple the
windmills of
his imagination.
An 18-year-old
decides,
arbitrarily,
that she
wants to
retire at
52.
She works
for three
decades to
make that
happen,
failing to
notice that
she made
that decision
when she
was little
more than
a child.
What did
she know
about her
52-year-old
self when
still a
teenager?
Even now,
many years
later,
she has
only the
vaguest,
lowest-resolution
idea of
her post-work
Eden.
She refuses
to notice.
What did
her life mean
if that
initial goal
was wrong?
She's afraid
of opening
Pandora's
box where
all the
troubles of
the world
reside.
But hope
is in
there,
too.
Instead,
she warps
her life
to fit
the fantasies
of a
sheltered
adolescent.
A naively
formulated
goal transmutes
with time
into the
sinister form
of the
life-lie.
One 40-something
client told me
his vision,
formulated by
his younger
self.
I see
myself
retired,
sitting on
a tropical
beach,
drinking
margaritas
in the
sunshine.
That's not
a plan.
That's a
travel poster.
After eight
margaritas,
you're fit
only to
await the
hangover.
After three
weeks of
margarita-filled
days,
if you have
any sense,
you're bored
stiff and
self-disgusted.
In a year
or less,
you're pathetic.
It's just
not a
sustainable
approach to
later life.
This kind
of oversimplification
and falsification
is particularly
typical of
ideologues.
They adopt
a single
axiom.
Government
is bad.
Immigration
is bad.
Capitalism
is bad.
Patriarchy
is bad.
Then they
filter and
screen their
experiences and
insist ever
more narrowly
that everything
can be explained
by that
axiom.
They believe
narcissistically
underneath all
that bad
theory.
That the
world could
be put
right if
only they
held the
controls.
There is
another
fundamental
problem,
too,
with the
life lie,
particularly
when it
is based
on avoidance.
A sin
of commission
occurs when
you do
something you
know to
be wrong.
A sin
of omission
occurs when
you let
something bad
happen,
when you
could do
something to
stop it.
The former
is regarded
classically as
more serious
than the latter,
than avoidance.
I'm not so
sure.
Consider the
person who
insists that
everything is
right in her
life.
She avoids
conflict and
smiles and
does what she
is asked to
do.
She finds a
niche and
hides in it.
She does not
question authority
or put her own
ideas forward
and does not
complain when
mistreated.
She strives for
invisibility like a
fish in the
center of a
swarming
school, but a
secret unrest
gnaws at her
heart.
She is still
suffering, because
life is
suffering.
She is
lonesome and
isolated and
unfulfilled, but
her obedience and
self-obliteration
eliminate all the
meaning from her
life.
She has become
nothing but a
slave, a tool for
others to
exploit.
She does not
get what she
wants or needs,
because doing so
would mean speaking
her mind.
So, there is
nothing of value
in her existence
to counterbalance
life's troubles,
and that makes
her sick.
It might be the
noisy troublemakers
who disappear
first when the
institution you
serve falters
and shrinks, but
it's the invisible
who will be
sacrificed next.
Someone hiding
is not someone
vital.
Vitality requires
original contribution,
hiding also does
not save the
conforming and
conventional from
disease, insanity,
death, and
taxes.
And hiding from
others also means
suppressing and
hiding the
potentialities of
the unrealized
self.
And that's the
problem.
If you will not
reveal yourself to
others, you
cannot reveal
yourself to
yourself.
That does not
only mean that you
suppress who you
are, although it
also means that.
It means that so
much of what you
could be will never
be forced by
necessity to come
forward.
This is a
biological truth, as
well as a
conceptual truth.
When you explore
boldly, when you
voluntarily confront
the unknown, you
gather information and
build your renewed
self out of that
information.
That is the
conceptual element.
However, researchers
have recently
discovered that new
genes in the
central nervous
system turn
themselves on when
an organism is
placed, or places
itself, in a new
situation.
These genes code
for new proteins.
These proteins are
the building blocks
for new structures
in the brain.
This means that a
lot of you is still
nascent in the most
physical of senses,
and will not be
called forth by
stasis.
You have to say
something, go
somewhere, and do
things to get
turned on.
And, if not, you
remain incomplete, and
life is too hard for
anyone incomplete.
If you say no to
your boss or your
spouse or your
mother when it
needs to be said,
then you transform
yourself into
someone who can
say no when it
needs to be said.
If you say yes
when no needs to
be said, however,
you transform
yourself into
someone who can
only say yes,
even when it is
very clearly time
to say no.
If you ever wonder
how perfectly
ordinary, decent
people could find
themselves doing
the terrible things
the gulag camp
guards did, you
now have your
answer.
By the time no
seriously needed to
be said, there was
no one left capable
of saying it.
If you betray
yourself, if you
say untrue things,
if you act out a
lie, you weaken
your character, if
you have a weak
character, then
adversity will mow
you down when it
appears, as it
will inevitably.
You will hide, but
there will be no
place left to hide,
and then you will
find yourself doing
terrible things.
Only the most
cynical, hopeless
philosophy insists
that reality could
be improved through
falsification.
Such a philosophy
judges being and
becoming alike, and
deems them flawed.
It denounces truth
as insufficient, and
the honest man as
deluded.
It is a philosophy
that both brings
about and then
justifies the endemic
corruption of the
world.
It is not
vision as such, and
not a plan devised
to achieve a
vision, that is at
fault under such
circumstances.
A vision of the
future, the
desirable future, is
necessary.
Such a vision links
action taken now
with important,
long-term, foundational
values.
It lends action in
the present,
significance and
importance.
It provides a
frame limiting
uncertainty and
anxiety.
It's not vision.
It is instead
willful blindness.
It's the worst
sort of lie.
It's subtle.
It avails itself of
easy rationalizations.
Willful blindness is
the refusal to know
something that could
be known.
It's refusal to
admit that the
knocking sound means
someone at the
door.
It's refusal to
acknowledge the
800-pound gorilla in
the room, the
elephant under the
carpet, the
skeleton in the
closet.
It's refusal to
admit to error while
pursuing the plan.
Every game has
rules.
Some of the most
important rules are
implicit.
You accept them
merely by deciding
to play the game.
The first of these
rules is that the
game is important.
If it wasn't
important, you
wouldn't be playing
it.
Playing a game defines
it as important.
The second is that
moves undertaken
during the game are
valid if they help
you win.
If you make a move
and it isn't helping
you win, then, by
definition, it's a
bad move.
You need to try
something different.
You remember the
old joke.
Insanity is doing
the same thing over
and over while
expecting different
results.
If you're lucky
and you fail and
you try something
new, you move
ahead.
If that doesn't
work, you try
something different
again.
A minor modification
will suffice in
fortunate circumstances.
It is therefore
prudent to begin
with small changes
and see if they
help.
Sometimes, however,
the entire hierarchy
of values is
faulty and the
whole edifice has
to be abandoned.
The whole game
must be changed.
That's a revolution
with all the chaos
and terror of a
revolution.
It's not something
to be engaged in
lightly, but it's
sometimes necessary.
Error necessitates
sacrifice to correct
it, and serious
error necessitates
serious sacrifice.
To accept the truth
means to sacrifice.
And if you have
rejected the truth
for a long time,
then you've run up
a dangerously large
sacrificial debt.
Forest fires burn
out deadwood and
return trapped
elements to the
soil.
Sometimes, however,
fires are suppressed
artificially.
That does not stop
the deadwood from
accumulating.
Sooner or later,
a fire will start.
When it does,
it will burn so
hot that everything
will be destroyed,
even the soil in
which the forest
grows.
The prideful,
rational mind,
comfortable with
its certainty,
enamored of its
own brilliance,
is easily tempted
to ignore error
and to sweep dirt
under the rug.
Literary,
existential philosophers,
beginning with
Soren Kierkegaard,
conceived of this
mode of being
as inauthentic.
An inauthentic
person continues
to perceive and
act in ways his
own experience has
demonstrated false.
He does not speak
with his own voice.
Did what I want
happen?
No.
Then my aim
or my methods
were wrong.
I still have
something to learn.
That is the voice
of authenticity.
Did what I want
happen?
No.
Then the world
is unfair.
People are jealous
and too stupid
to understand.
It is the fault
of something
or someone else.
That is the voice
of inauthenticity.
It is not too far
from there
to
they should be
stopped
or
they must be
hurt
or
they must be
destroyed.
Whenever you hear
about something
incomprehensibly
brutal,
such ideas
have manifested
themselves.
There is no
blaming any of
this on
unconsciousness
either
or repression.
When the
individual lies,
he knows it.
He may
blind himself
to the
consequences
of his
actions.
He may
fail to
analyze
and
articulate
his past
so that
he does
not
understand.
He may
even forget
that he lied
and so be
unconscious
of that
fact.
But he
was conscious
in the
present
during the
commission
of each
error
and the
omission
of each
responsibility.
At that
moment,
he knew
what he
was up
to.
And the
sins of
the
inauthentic
individual
compound
and corrupt
the state.
Someone
power-hungry
makes a
new rule
at your
workplace.
It's
unnecessary.
It's
counterproductive.
It's
an irritant.
It removes
some of the
pleasure and
meaning from
your work.
But you
tell yourself,
it's all
right.
It's not
worth
complaining
about.
Then it
happens again.
You've
already trained
yourself to
allow such
things.
By failing
to react
the first
time.
You're a
little less
courageous.
Your
opponent,
unopposed,
is a
little bit
stronger.
The
institution
is a
little bit
more
corrupt.
The
process of
bureaucratic
stagnation and
oppression is
underway.
And you've
contributed by
pretending that
it was
okay.
Why not
complain?
Why not
take a
stand?
If you
do,
other people
equally
afraid to
speak up,
may come
to your
defense.
And if
not,
maybe it's
time for a
revolution.
Maybe you
should find a
job somewhere
else where
your soul is
less in
danger from
corruption.
For what
shall it
profit a
man if he
gain the
whole world
and forfeit
his soul?
Mark 8,
36.
One of
the major
contributions
of
Alexander
Solzhenitsyn's
masterwork,
the Gulag
Archipelago,
was his
analysis of
the direct
causal
relationship
between the
pathology of
the Soviet
prison-work-camp-dependent
state, where
millions suffered
and died, and
the almost
universal
proclivity of
the Soviet
citizen to
falsify his
own day-to-day
personal experience,
deny his own
state-induced
suffering, and
thereby prop up
the dictates of
the rational
ideology-possessed
communist system.
It was this
bad faith, this
denial, that
in Solzhenitsyn's
opinion, aided and
abetted that
great paranoid
mass murderer,
Joseph Stalin, in
his crimes.
Solzhenitsyn wrote
the truth, his
truth, hard
learned through
his own
experiences in
the camps,
exposing the
lies of the
Soviet state.
No educated
person dared
defend that
ideology again
after Solzhenitsyn
published the
Gulag Archipelago.
No one could
ever say again,
what Stalin did,
that was not
true communism.
Viktor Frankl,
the psychiatrist
and Nazi
concentration camp
survivor who
wrote the
classic man's
search for
meaning, drew
a similar
social-psychological
conclusion.
Deceitful,
inauthentic
individual
existence is
the precursor
to social
totalitarianism.
Sigmund
Freud, for
his part,
analogously
believed that
repression
contributed in a
non-trivial
manner to the
development of
mental illness,
and the
difference between
repression of
truth and a
lie is a matter
of degree,
not kind.
Alfred Adler
knew it was
lies that
bred sickness.
C.G.
Jung knew that
moral problems
plagued his
patience, and
that such
problems were
caused by
untruth.
All these
thinkers, all
centrally
concerned with
pathology, both
individual and
cultural, came
to the same
conclusion.
Lies warp the
structure of
being.
Untruth corrupts
the soul and
the state alike,
and one form of
corruption feeds
the other.
I have
repeatedly observed
the transformation
of mere
existential misery
into outright
hell by
betrayal and
deceit.
The barely
manageable
crisis of a
parent's terminal
illness can be
turned, for
example, into
something awful
beyond description
by the unseemly
and petty
squabbling of
the sufferer's
adult children.
Obsessed by the
unresolved past,
they gather like
ghouls around the
deathbed, forcing
tragedy into an
unholy dalliance
with cowardice and
resentment.
The inability of a
son to thrive
independently is
exploited by a
mother bent on
shielding her
child from all
disappointment and
pain.
He never leaves,
and she is
never lonely.
It's an evil
conspiracy forged
slowly as the
pathology unfolds
by thousands of
knowing winks and
nods.
She plays the
martyr, doomed to
support her son, and
garners nourishing
sympathy like a
vampire from
supporting friends.
He broods in his
basement, imagining
himself oppressed.
He fantasizes with
delight about the
havoc he might wreak on
the world that rejected
him for his cowardice,
awkwardness, and
inability.
And sometimes he
wreaks precisely that
havoc.
And everyone asks,
why?
They could know,
but refuse to.
Even well-lived
lives can, of course,
be warped and hurt
and twisted by
illness and
infirmity and
uncontrollable
catastrophe.
Depression,
bipolar disorder,
and schizophrenia,
like cancer, all
involve biological
factors beyond the
individual's immediate
control.
The difficulties
intrinsic to life
itself are
sufficient to
weaken and
overwhelm each of
us, pushing us
beyond our limits,
breaking us at our
weakest point.
Not even the best
lived life provides
an absolute defense
against vulnerability.
But the family that
fights in the ruins of
their earthquake-
devastated dwelling
place is much less
likely to rebuild than
the family made strong
by mutual trust and
devotion.
Any natural weakness
or existential
challenge, no matter
how minor, can be
magnified into a
serious crisis with
enough deceit in the
individual, family, or
culture.
The honest human
spirit may continually
fail in its attempts
to bring about
paradise on earth.
It may manage,
however, to reduce the
suffering attendant on
existence to bearable
levels.
The tragedy of
being is the
consequence of our
limitations and the
vulnerability to
finding human
experience.
It may even be the
price we pay for
being itself, since
existence must be
limited to be at
all.
I have seen a
husband adapt
honestly and
courageously while
his wife descended
into terminal
dementia.
He made the
necessary adjustments
step by step.
He accepted help
when he needed it.
He refused to deny
her sad deterioration
and in that manner
adapted gracefully to
it.
I saw the family of
that same woman come
together in a
supporting and
sustaining manner as
she lay dying and
gain newfound
connections with each
other, brother,
sisters, grandchildren
and father, as
partial but genuine
compensation for their
loss.
I have seen my
teenage daughter live
through the destruction
of her hip and her
ankle and survive two
years of continual
intense pain and
emerge with her
spirit intact.
I watched her younger
brother voluntarily and
without resentment
sacrifice many
opportunities for
friendship and social
engagement to stand
by her and us
while she suffered.
With love,
encouragement and
character intact, a
human being can be
resilient beyond
imagining.
What cannot be born,
however, is the
absolute ruin produced
by tragedy and
deception.
The capacity of the
rational mind to
deceive, manipulate,
scheme, trick,
falsify, minimize,
mislead, betray,
prevaricate, deny,
omit, rationalize,
bias, exaggerate, and
obscure is so
endless, so
remarkable, that
centuries of
pre-scientific thought
concentrating on
clarifying the nature
of moral endeavor
regarded it as
positively
demonic.
This is not because of
rationality itself as a
process.
That process can
produce clarity and
progress.
It is because
rationality is subject
to the single worst
temptation, to raise
what it knows now to
the status of an
absolute.
We can turn to the
great poet John
Milton once again to
clarify just what this
means.
Over thousands of
years of history, the
Western world wrapped a
dream-like fantasy about
the nature of evil around
its central religious
core.
That fantasy had a
protagonist, an
adversarial personality,
absolutely dedicated to
the corruption of being.
Milton took it upon
himself to organize,
dramatize, and
articulate the essence
of this collective
dream, and gave it
life in the figure of
Satan, Lucifer, the
light-bearer.
He writes of Lucifer's
primal temptation and
its immediate
consequences.
He trusted to have
equaled the most high if
he opposed, and with
ambitious aim against
the throne and
monarchy of God, raised
impious war in heaven
and battle-proud with
vain attempt.
Him, the almighty
power, hurled headlong
flaming from the
ethereal sky with
hideous ruin and
combustion, down to
bottomless perdition,
there to dwell in
adamantine chains and
penal fire.
Lucifer, in Milton's
eyes, the spirit of
reason, was the most
wondrous angel brought
forth from the void by
God.
This can be read
psychologically.
Reason is something
alive.
It lives in all of us.
It's older than any of
us.
It's best understood as
a personality, not a
faculty.
It has its aims and
its temptations and
its weaknesses.
It flies higher and
sees farther than any
other spirit.
But reason falls in
love with itself, and
worse, it falls in
love with its own
productions.
It elevates them and
worships them as
absolutes.
Lucifer is, therefore,
the spirit of
totalitarianism.
He is flung from
heaven into hell
because such
elevation, such
rebellion against the
highest and
incomprehensible,
inevitably produces
hell.
To say it again, it is
the greatest temptation
of the rational faculty
to glorify its own
capacity and its own
productions, and to
claim that in the face
of its theories, nothing
transcendent or outside
its domain need
exist.
This means that all
important facts have
been discovered.
This means that nothing
important remains
unknown.
But most importantly, it
means denial of the
necessity for courageous
individual confrontation
with being.
What is going to save
you?
The totalitarian says,
in essence, you must
rely on faith in what
you already know.
But that is not what
saves.
What saves is the
willingness to learn
from what you don't
know.
That is faith in the
possibility of human
transformation.
That is faith in the
sacrifice of the current
self for the self that
could be.
The totalitarian denies
the necessity for the
individual to take
ultimate responsibility
for being.
That denial is the
meaning of rebellion
against the Most High.
That is what
totalitarian means.
Everything that needs
to be discovered has
been discovered.
Everything will unfold
precisely as planned.
All problems will vanish
forever once the
perfect system is
accepted.
Milton's great poem
was a prophecy.
As rationality rose
ascendant from the ashes
of Christianity, the
great threat of total
systems accompanied it.
Communism, in particular,
was attractive not so
much to oppressed
workers, its hypothetical
beneficiaries, but to
intellectuals, to those
whose arrogant pride in
intellect assured them
they were always right.
But the promised utopia
never emerged.
Instead, humanity
experienced the
inferno of Stalinist
Russia and Mao's China
and Pol Pot's Cambodia,
and the citizens of those
states were required to
betray their own
experience, turn against
their fellow citizens, and
die in the tens of
millions.
There is an old
Soviet joke.
An American dies
and goes to hell.
Satan himself
shows them around.
They pass a large
cauldron.
The American
peers in.
It's full of
suffering souls
burning in hot
pitch.
As they struggle
to leave the pot,
low-ranking devils
sitting on the
rim
pitchfork
them back in.
The American
is properly
shocked.
Satan says,
That's where we
put sinful
Englishmen.
The tour continues.
Soon, the duo
approaches a
second cauldron.
It's slightly
larger
and slightly
hotter.
The American
peers in.
It is also
full of
suffering souls,
all wearing
berets.
Devils are
pitchforking
would-be escapees
back into this
cauldron as well.
That's where we
put sinful
Frenchmen,
Satan says.
In the distance
is a third
cauldron.
It's much
bigger and
is glowing
white-hot.
The American
can barely
get near it.
Nonetheless,
at Satan's
insistence,
he approaches
it and
peers in.
It is
absolutely
packed with
souls,
barely visible
under the
surface of
the boiling
liquid.
Now and
then,
however,
one clambers
out of the
pitch and
desperately
reaches for
the rim.
Oddly,
there are
no devils
sitting on
the edge
of this
giant pot,
but the
clamberer
disappears
back under
the surface
anyway.
The American
asks,
why are there
no demons
here to keep
everyone from
escaping?
Satan replies,
this is where
we put the
Russians.
If one
tries to
escape,
the others
pull him
back in.
Milton
believed that
stubborn refusal
to change
in the face
of error
not only
meant
ejection
from heaven
and subsequent
degeneration
into an
ever-deepening
hell,
but the
rejection
of redemption
itself.
Satan
knows full
well that
even if he
was willing
to seek
reconciliation
and God
willing to
grant it,
he would
only rebel
again because
he will not
change.
Perhaps it
is this
prideful
stubbornness
that constitutes
the mysterious
unforgivable
sin against
the Holy
Ghost.
farewell
happy
fields
where joy
forever
dwells.
Hail
horrors!
Hail
infernal
world!
And thou
profoundest
hell
receive thy
new
possessor,
one who
brings a
mind not
to be
changed by
place or
time.
This is
no afterlife
fantasy.
This is
no perverse
realm of
post-existence
torture for
political
enemies.
This is
an abstract
idea and
abstractions
are often
more real
than what
they represent.
The idea
that hell
exists in
some metaphysical
manner is
not only
ancient and
pervasive,
it's true.
Hell is
eternal.
It has
always existed.
It exists
now.
It's the
most barren,
hopeless,
and malevolent
subdivision of
the underworld
of chaos where
disappointed and
resentful people
forever dwell.
The mind
is its own
place and
in itself
can make a
heaven of
hell, a
hell of
heaven.
Here we
may reign
secure, and
in my choice
to reign is
worth ambition,
though in
hell, better
to reign in
hell than
serve in
heaven.
Those who
have lied
enough in
word and
action live
there, in
hell, now.
Take a walk
down any busy
urban street,
keep your eyes
open, and pay
attention.
You will see
people who
are there,
now.
These are the
people to whom
you instinctively
give a wide
berth.
These are the
people who are
immediately angered
if you direct
your gaze toward
them, although
sometimes they
will instead
turn away in
shame.
I saw a
horribly damaged
street alcoholic
do exactly that
in the presence
of my young
daughter.
He wanted,
above all,
to avoid seeing
his degraded
state
incontrovertibly
reflected in
her eyes.
It is deceit
that makes
people miserable
beyond what
they can bear.
It is deceit
that fills
human souls
with resentment
and vengefulness.
It is deceit
that produces
the terrible
suffering of
mankind,
the death
camps of
the Nazis,
the torture
chambers and
genocides of
Stalin,
and that even
greater monster
Mao.
It was deceit
that killed
hundreds of
millions of
people in
the 20th
century.
It was deceit
that almost
doomed
civilization
itself.
It is deceit
that still
threatens us
most profoundly
today.
The truth
instead.
What happens
if, instead,
we decide
to stop
lying?
What does
this even
mean?
We are
limited in
our knowledge
after all.
We must
make decisions
here and
now, even
though the
best means
and the
best goals
can never
be discerned
with certainty.
An aim,
an ambition,
provides the
structure necessary
for action.
An aim
provides a
destination,
a point of
contrast against
the present,
and a framework
within which
all things can
be evaluated.
An aim
defines progress
and makes
such progress
exciting.
an aim
reduces
anxiety,
because if
you have
no aim,
everything
can mean
anything
or nothing,
and neither
of those
two options
makes for
a tranquil
spirit.
Thus,
we have to
think and
plan and
limit and
pause it in
order to
live it all.
How, then,
to envision
the future
and establish
our direction
without falling
prey to the
temptation of
totalitarian
certainty?
Some reliance
on tradition
can help us
establish our
aims.
It is
reasonable to
do what
other people
have always
done, unless
we have a
very good
reason not
to.
It is
reasonable to
become educated
and work
and find
love and
have a
family.
That is how
culture maintains
itself.
But it is
necessary to
aim at your
target, however
traditional, with
your eyes wide
open.
You have a
direction, but
it might be
wrong.
You have a
plan, but
it might be
ill-formed.
You may have
been led
astray by
your own
ignorance, and
worse, by
your own
unrevealed
corruption.
You must
make friends,
therefore, with
what you don't
know, instead
of what you
know.
You must
remain awake
to catch
yourself in
the act.
You must
remove the
beam in
your own
eye before
you concern
yourself with
the moat in
your brothers.
And in
this way, you
strengthen your
own spirit so
it can tolerate
the burden of
existence, and
you rejuvenate
the state.
The ancient
Egyptians had
already figured
this out
thousands of
years ago,
although their
knowledge remained
embodied in
dramatic form.
They worshipped
Osiris,
mythological
founder of the
state and the
god of
tradition.
Osiris,
however, was
vulnerable to
overthrow and
banishment to
the underworld by
Set, his
evil, scheming
brother.
The Egyptians
represented in
story the
fact that
social organizations
ossify with
time and
tend towards
willful blindness.
Osiris would
not see his
brother's true
character, even
though he
could have.
Set waits,
and, at an
opportune moment,
attacks.
He hacks
Osiris into
pieces and
scatters the
divine remains
through the
kingdom.
He sends
his brother's
spirit to
the underworld.
He makes
it very
difficult for
Osiris to
pull himself
back together.
Fortunately,
the great
king did
not have to
deal with
Set on
his own.
The Egyptians
also worshipped
Horus, the
son of
Osiris.
Horus took
the twin
forms of a
falcon, the
most visually
acute of all
creatures, and
the still
famous hieroglyphic
single Egyptian
eye, as
alluded to in
Rule 7.
Osiris is
tradition, aged
and willfully
blind.
Horus, his
son, could
and would, by
contrast, see.
Horus was the
god of
attention.
That is not
the same as
rationality.
Because he
paid attention,
Horus could
perceive and
triumph against
the evils of
Set, his
uncle, albeit
at great
cost.
When Horus
confronts Set,
they have a
terrible battle.
Before Set's
defeat and
banishment from
the kingdom, he
tears out one of
his nephew's
eyes.
But the
eventually
victorious
Horus takes
back the
eye.
Then he does
something truly
unexpected.
He journeys
voluntarily to
the underworld and
gives the eye to
his father.
what does this
mean?
First, that the
encounter with
malevolence and
evil is of
sufficient terror to
damage even the
vision of a
god.
Second, that the
attentive son can
restore the vision
of his father.
Culture is always
in a near-dead
state, even
though it was
established by the
spirit of great
people in the
past.
But the present
is not the
past.
The wisdom of
the past thus
deteriorates or
becomes outdated in
proportion to the
genuine difference
between the
conditions of the
present and the
past.
That is a mere
consequence of the
passage of time and
the change that
passage inevitably
brings.
But it is also the
case that culture and
its wisdom is
additionally vulnerable
to corruption, to
voluntary, willful
blindness and
Mephistophelian
intrigue.
Thus, the
inevitable functional
decline of the
institutions granted
to us by our
ancestors is sped
along by our
misbehavior, our
missing of the
mark in the
present.
It is our
responsibility to
see what is
before our eyes
courageously and
to learn from it,
even if it seems
horrible, even if
the horror of
seeing it damages
our consciousness
and half-blinds
us.
The act of
seeing is
particularly important
when it challenges
what we know and
rely on, upsetting
and destabilizing
us.
It is the act of
seeing that informs
the individual and
updates the state.
It was for this
reason that Nietzsche
said that a man's
worth was determined
by how much truth
he could tolerate.
You are by no
means only what you
already know.
You are also all
that which you
could know, if
you only would.
Thus, you should
never sacrifice
what you could be
for what you
are.
You should never
give up the
better that resides
within for the
security you already
have, and
certainly not when
you have already
caught a glimpse,
an undeniable
glimpse, of
something beyond.
In the Christian
tradition, Christ
is identified with
the Logos.
The Logos is the
Word of God.
That Word
transformed chaos
into order at the
beginning of time.
In his human form,
Christ sacrificed
himself voluntarily
to the truth,
to the good,
to God.
In consequence,
he died and was
reborn.
The Word that
produces order from
chaos sacrifices
everything, even
itself, to God.
That single
sentence, wise
beyond comprehension,
sums up
Christianity.
Every bit of
learning is a
little death.
Every bit of
new information
challenges a
previous conception,
forcing it to
dissolve into chaos
before it can be
reborn as something
better.
Sometimes, such
deaths virtually
destroy us.
In such cases, we
might never recover,
or, if we do, we
change a lot.
A good friend of
mine discovered that
his wife of decades
was having an
affair.
He didn't see it
coming.
It plunged him into
a deep depression.
He descended into
the underworld.
He told me at one
point, I always
thought that people
who were depressed
should just shake
it off.
I didn't have
any idea what
I was talking
about.
Eventually, he
returned from the
depths.
In many ways, he's
a new man, and,
perhaps, a wiser
and better man.
He lost 40
pounds.
He ran a
marathon.
He traveled to
Africa and climbed
Mount Kilimanjaro.
He chose
rebirth over
descent into
hell.
Set your
ambitions, even
if you are
uncertain about
what they should
be.
The better
ambitions have
to do with the
development of
character and
ability, rather
than status and
power.
Status you can
lose.
You carry
character with
you wherever you
go, and it
allows you to
prevail against
adversity.
Knowing this,
tie a rope to a
boulder.
Pick up the
great stone,
heave it in front
of you, and
pull yourself
towards it.
Watch and
observe while you
move forward.
Articulate your
experience as
clearly and
carefully to
yourself and
others as you
possibly can.
In this
manner, you
will learn to
proceed more
effectively and
efficiently towards
your goal.
And, while you
are doing this,
do not lie,
especially to
yourself.
If you pay
attention to
what you do
and say, you
can learn to
feel a state of
internal division
and weakness
when you are
misbehaving and
misspeaking.
It's an embodied
sensation, not a
thought.
I experience an
internal sensation
of sinking and
division rather
than solidity and
strength when I
am incautious with
my acts and
words.
It seems to be
centered in my
solar plexus,
where a large
knot of nervous
tissue resides.
I learned to
recognize when I
was lying, in
fact, by noticing
this sinking and
division and
then inferring the
presence of a
lie.
It often took me a
long time to
ferret out the
deception.
Sometimes I was
using words for
appearance.
Sometimes I was
trying to disguise
my own true
ignorance of the
topic at hand.
Sometimes I was
using the words
of others to
avoid the
responsibility of
thinking for
myself.
If you pay
attention when
you are seeking
something, you
will move towards
your goal.
More importantly,
however, you will
acquire the
information that
allows your goal
itself to
transform.
A totalitarian
never asks,
what if my
current ambition
is an error?
He treats it
instead as the
absolute.
It becomes his
god for all
intents and
purposes.
It constitutes
his highest
value.
It regulates his
emotions and
motivational states
and determines
his thoughts.
All people
serve their
ambition.
In that matter,
there are no
atheists.
There are only
people who know
and don't know
what god they
serve.
if you bend
everything totally
blindly and
willfully towards
the attainment of
a goal and
only that goal,
you will never be
able to discover
if another goal
would serve you
and the world
better.
It is this that
you sacrifice if
you do not tell
the truth.
If, instead,
you tell the
truth, your
values transform
as you progress.
If you allow
yourself to be
informed by the
reality manifesting
itself as you
struggle forward,
your notions of
what is important
will change.
You will reorient
yourself,
sometimes gradually
and sometimes
suddenly and
radically.
Imagine,
you go to
engineering school
because that is
what your parents
desire,
but it is not
what you want.
Working at
cross purposes
to your own
wishes,
you will find
yourself unmotivated
and failing.
You will struggle
to concentrate
and discipline
yourself,
but it will not
work.
Your soul
will reject
the tyranny
of your will.
How else
could that be
said?
Why are you
complying?
You may not
want to disappoint
your parents,
although if you
fail, you will
do exactly that.
You may lack
the courage for
the conflict
necessary to
free yourself.
You may not
want to sacrifice
your childish
belief in parental
omniscience,
wishing devoutly
to continue
believing that
there is someone
who knows you
better than you
know yourself
and who also
knows all about
the world.
You want to be
shielded in this
manner from the
stark existential
aloneness of
individual being
and its attendant
responsibility.
This is all
very common
and understandable,
but you suffer
because you are
truly not meant
to be an
engineer.
One day,
you've had
enough.
You drop out.
You disappoint
your parents.
You learn to
live with that.
You consult
only yourself,
even though that
means you must
rely on your
own decisions.
You take a
philosophy degree.
You accept
the burden
of your own
mistakes.
You become
your own
person.
By rejecting
your father's
vision,
you develop
your own.
And then,
as your parents
age,
you've become
adult enough
to be there
for them
when they
come to
need you.
They win
too.
But both
victories had
to be purchased
at the cost
of the conflict
engendered by
your truth.
As Matthew
10.34
has it,
citing Christ,
emphasizing the
role of the
spoken truth.
Think not
that I have
come to send
peace on earth.
I came not
to send peace,
but a sword.
As you
continue to
live in
accordance with
the truth as
it reveals
itself to you,
you will have
to accept and
deal with the
conflicts that
mode of being
will generate.
If you do
so, you will
continue to
mature and
become more
responsible,
in small
ways, don't
underestimate
their importance,
and in
large.
You will
ever more
closely approach
your newer
and more
wisely
formulated
goals,
and become
even wiser
in their
formulation
when you
discover and
rectify your
inevitable errors.
Your conception
of what is
important will
become more
and more
appropriate as
you incorporate
the wisdom
of your
experience.
You will
quit wildly
oscillating and
walk ever
more directly
towards the
good,
a good you
could have
never
comprehended if
you had
insisted,
despite all
evidence that
you were
right,
absolutely
right,
at the
beginning.
If
existence is
good, then
the clearest
and cleanest
and most
correct
relationship
with it is
also good.
If existence
is not
good, by
contrast,
you're
lost.
Nothing
will save
you,
certainly
not the
petty
rebellions,
murky
thinking,
and
obscurantist
blindness that
constitute
deceit.
Is
existence
good?
You have
to take
a terrible
risk to
find out.
Live
in truth
or live
in deceit.
Face
the
consequences
and draw
your
conclusions.
This
is the
act of
faith
whose
necessity
was
insisted
upon
by the
Danish
philosopher
Kierkegaard.
You
cannot
know
ahead
of time.
Even
a good
example
is
insufficient
for proof
given the
differences
between
individuals.
The
success
of a
good
example
can
always
be
attributed
to
luck.
Thus,
you have
to risk
your
particular
individual
life
to find
out.
It is
this
risk
that the
ancients
described
as the
sacrifice
of
personal
will
to the
will
of
God.
It
is
not
an
act
of
submission,
at
least
as
submission
is
currently
understood.
It
is
an
act
of
courage.
It
is
faith
that
the
wind
will
blow
your
ship
to
a
new
and
better
port.
It
is
the
faith
that
being
can
be
corrected
by
becoming.
It
is
the
spirit
of
exploration
itself.
Perhaps
it is
better
to
conceptualize
it
this
way.
Everyone
needs
a
concrete
specific
goal,
an
ambition,
and a
purpose,
to
limit
chaos
and
make
intelligible
sense
of
his
or
her
life.
But
all
such
concrete
goals
can
and
should
be
subordinated
to
what
might
be
considered
a
meta
goal,
which
is
a
way
of
approaching
and
formulating
goals
themselves.
The
meta
goal
could
be
live
in
truth.
This
means
act
diligently
towards
some
well-articulated,
defined,
and
temporary
end.
Make
your
criteria
for
failure
and
success
timely
and
clear,
at
least
for
yourself,
and
even
better
if
others
can
understand
what
you
are
doing
and
evaluate
it
with
you.
While
doing
so,
however,
allow
the
world
and
your
spirit
to
unfold
as
they
will
while
you
act
out
and
articulate
the
truth.
This
is
both
pragmatic
ambition
and
the
most
courageous
of
faiths.
Life
is
suffering.
The Buddha
stated that
explicitly.
Christians
portray the
same sentiment
imagistically
with the
divine crucifix.
The Jewish
faith is
saturated with
its remembrance.
the
equivalence
of
life
and
limitation
is
the
primary
and
unavoidable
fact
of
existence.
The
vulnerability
of
our
being
renders
us
susceptible
to
the
pains
of
social
judgment
and
contempt
and
the
inevitable
breakdown
of
our
bodies.
But
even
all
those
ways
of
suffering,
terrible
as
they
are,
are
not
sufficient
to
corrupt
the
world,
to
transform
it
into
hell,
the
way
the
Nazis
and
the
Maoists
and
the
Stalinists
corrupted
the
world
and
turned
it
into
hell.
For
that,
as
Hitler
stated
so
clearly,
you
need
the
lie.
In
the
big
lie,
there
is
always
a
certain
force
of
credibility,
because
the
broad
masses
of
a
nation
are
always
more
easily
corrupted
in
the
deeper
strata
of
their
emotional
nature
than
consciously
or
voluntarily.
And
thus,
in
the
primitive
simplicity
of
their
minds,
they
more
readily
fall
victims
to
the
big
lie
than
the
small
lie,
since
they
themselves
often
tell
small
lies
in
little
matters,
but
would
be
ashamed
to
resort
to
large
scale
falsehoods.
It
would
never
come
into
their
heads
to
fabricate
colossal
untruths,
and
they
would
not
believe
that
others
could
have
the
impudence
to
distort
the
truth
so
infamously.
Even
though
the
facts
which
prove
this
to
be
so
may
be
brought
clearly
to
their
minds,
they
will
still
doubt
and
waver
and
will
continue
to
think
that
there
may
be
some
other
explanation.
For
the
big
lie,
you
first
need
the
little
lie.
The
little
lie
is,
metaphorically
speaking,
the bait
used by
the father
of lies
to hook
his
victims.
The
human
capacity
for
imagination
makes
us
capable
of
dreaming
up and
creating
alternative
worlds.
This
is
the
ultimate
source
of
our
creativity.
With
that
singular
capacity,
however,
comes
the
counterpart,
the
opposite
side
of
the
coin.
We
can
deceive
ourselves
and
others
into
believing
and
acting
as if
things
are
other
than
we
know
they
are.
And
why
not
lie?
Why
not
twist
and
distort
things
to
obtain
a
small
gain
or
to
smooth
things
over
or
to
keep
the
peace
or
to
avoid
hurt
feelings?
Reality
has
its
terrible
aspect.
Do we
really
need
to
confront
its
snake
headed
face
in
every
moment
of
our
waking
consciousness
and
at
every
turn
in
our
lives?
Why
not
turn
away
at
least
when
looking
is
simply
too
painful?
The
reason
is
simple.
Things
fall
apart.
What
worked
yesterday
will
not
necessarily
work
today.
We
have
inherited
the
great
machinery
of
state
and
culture
from
our
forefathers,
but
they
are
dead
and
cannot
deal
with
the
changes
of
the
day.
The
living
can.
We
can
open
our
eyes
and
modify
what
we
have
where
necessary
and
keep
the
machinery
running
smoothly.
Or
we
can
pretend
that
everything
is
all
right,
fail
to
make
the
necessary
repairs,
and
then
curse
fate
when
nothing
goes
our
way.
Things
fall
apart.
This
is one
of the
great
discoveries
of
humanity,
and we
speed the
natural
deterioration
of great
things
through
blindness,
inaction,
and deceit.
Without
attention,
culture
degenerates
and dies,
and evil
prevails.
What
you see
of a
lie
when you
act it
out,
and most
lies are
acted out
rather than
told,
is very
little of
what it
actually
is.
A
lie is
connected
to everything
else.
It
produces
the same
effect on
the world
that a
single drop
of sewage
produces
in even
the largest
crystal
magnum
of
champagne.
It
is
something
best
considered
live
and
growing.
When
the lies
get big
enough,
the whole
world
spoils.
But if
you look
close
enough,
the biggest
of lies
is composed
of smaller
lies,
and those
are composed
of still
smaller
lies,
and the
smallest
of lies
is where
the big
lie
starts.
It
is not
the mere
misstatement
of fact.
It
is instead
an act
that has
the aspect
of the
most serious
conspiracy
ever to
possess
the race
of man.
Its
seeming
innocuousness,
its trivial
meanness,
the feeble
arrogance
that gives
rise to
it,
the
apparently
trivial
circumventing
of
responsibility
that it
aims at,
these all
work
effectively
to
camouflage
its
true
nature,
its
genuine
dangerousness,
and its
equivalence
with the
great
acts
of evil
that man
perpetrates
and often
enjoys.
Lies
corrupt
the world.
Worse,
that is
their intent.
first,
a little
lie,
then several
little lies
to prop
it up,
after that
distorted
thinking to
avoid the
shame that
those lies
produce,
then a few
more lies to
cover up the
consequences of
the distorted
thinking,
then,
most terribly,
the transformation
of those now
necessary lies
through practice
into
automatized,
specialized,
structural,
neurologically
instantiated,
unconscious
belief and
action.
Then,
the sickening
of experience
itself,
as action
predicated on
falsehood,
fails to
produce the
results intended.
If you don't
believe in brick
walls,
you will still
be injured
when you run
headlong into
one.
Then,
you will curse
reality itself
for producing
the wall.
After that
comes the
arrogance and
sense of
superiority that
inevitably
accompanies the
production of
successful lies,
hypothetically
successful lies.
And that is
one of the
greatest dangers.
Apparently,
everyone is
fooled,
so everyone
is stupid
except me.
Everyone is
stupid and
fooled by me,
so I can get
away with
whatever I want.
Finally,
there is the
proposition.
Being itself
is susceptible
to my
manipulations,
thus it
deserves no
respect.
That's things
falling apart,
like Osiris,
severed into
pieces.
That's the
structure of
the person or
the state
disintegrating
under the
influence of
a malign force.
That's the
chaos of the
underworld emerging
like a flood
to subsume
familiar ground.
But it's not
yet hell.
Hell comes
later.
Hell comes
when lies have
destroyed the
relationship
between
individual or
state and
reality itself.
Things fall
apart.
Life
degenerates.
Everything
becomes
frustration and
disappointment.
Hope
consistently
betrays.
The deceitful
individual
desperately
gestures at
sacrifice,
like Cain,
but fails to
please God.
Then the
drama enters
its final
act.
Tortured
by constant
failure,
the individual
becomes bitter.
Disappointment
and failure
amalgamate
and produce a
fantasy.
The world
is bent
on my
personal
suffering,
my particular
undoing,
my destruction.
I need,
I deserve,
I must have
my revenge.
That's the
gateway to hell.
That's when the
underworld,
a terrifying
and unfamiliar
place,
becomes misery
itself.
At the
beginning of
time,
according to
the great
Western
tradition,
the word
of God
transformed
chaos into
being through
the act of
speech.
It is
axiomatic
within that
tradition that
man and
woman alike
are made
in the image
of that
God.
We also
transform
chaos into
being through
speech.
We
transform
the manifold
possibilities of
the future
into the
actualities of
past and
present.
To tell
the truth
is to bring
the most
habitable
reality into
being.
Truth
builds
edifices that
can stand
a thousand
years.
Truth
feeds and
clothes the
poor and
makes nations
wealthy and
safe.
Truth
reduces the
terrible
complexity of
a man to
the simplicity
of his
word so
that he can
become a
partner rather
than an
enemy.
Truth
makes the
past truly
past and
makes the
best use of
the future's
possibilities.
Truth is
the ultimate
inexhaustible
natural resource.
It's the
light in the
darkness.
See the
truth.
Tell the
truth.
Truth will
not come in
the guise of
opinions shared
by others as
the truth is
neither a
collection of
slogans nor
an ideology.
It will
instead be
personal.
Your truth
is something
only you can
tell based
as it is on
the unique
circumstances
of your
life.
Apprehend
your personal
truth.
Communicate it
carefully in
an articulate
manner to
yourself and
others.
This will
ensure your
security and
your life
more abundantly
now while
you inhabit the
structure of
your current
beliefs.
This will
ensure the
benevolence of
the future
diverging as
it might from
the certainties
of the past.
The truth
springs forth
ever anew
from the
most profound
wellsprings of
being.
It will keep
your soul from
withering and
dying while you
encounter the
inevitable tragedy
of life.
It will help
you avoid the
terrible desire to
seek vengeance
for that
tragedy, part
of the terrible
sin of being
which everything
must bear
gracefully just
so it can
exist.
If your life
is not what it
could be, try
telling the
truth.
If you cling
desperately to
an ideology or
wallow in
nihilism, try
telling the
truth.
If you feel
weak and
rejected and
desperate and
confused, try
telling the
truth.
In paradise,
everyone speaks
the truth.
That is what
makes it
paradise.
Tell the
truth, or
at least don't
lie.
Rule nine.
Assume that
the person you
are listening
to might know
something you
don't.
Not advice.
Psychotherapy is
not advice.
Advice is what
you get when
the person you
are talking
with about
something horrible
and complicated
wishes you would
just shut up
and go away.
Advice is what
you get when
the person you
are talking to
wants to revel
in the superiority
of his or her
own intelligence.
If you weren't
so stupid, after
all, you
wouldn't have
your stupid
problems.
Psychotherapy is
genuine
conversation.
Genuine
conversation is
exploration,
articulation,
and strategizing.
When you're
involved in a
genuine conversation,
you're listening
and talking,
but mostly
listening.
Listening is
paying attention.
It's amazing what
people will tell you
if you listen.
Sometimes, if you
listen to people,
they will even tell
you what's wrong
with them.
Sometimes, they will
even tell you how
they plan to fix it.
Sometimes, that helps
you fix something
wrong with
yourself.
One surprising
time, and this
is only one
occasion of many
when such things
happened, I was
listening to someone
very carefully, and
she told me within
minutes, A, that
she was a witch, and
B, that her witch
coven spent a lot
of its time visualizing
world peace together.
She was a long-time,
lower-level
functionary in some
bureaucratic job.
I would never have
guessed that she was
a witch.
I also didn't know
that witch covens
spent any of their
time visualizing
world peace.
I didn't know what
to make of any of
it, either, but it
wasn't boring, and
that's something.
In my clinical
practice, I talk
and I listen.
I talk more to
some people and
listen more to
others.
Many of the people
I listen to have
no one else to
talk to.
Some of them are
truly alone in the
world.
There are far more
people like that
than you think.
You don't meet
them, because they
are alone.
Others are
surrounded by
tyrants or
narcissists or
drunks or
traumatized people
or professional
victims.
Some are not good
at articulating
themselves.
They go off on
tangents.
They repeat
themselves.
They say vague
and contradictory
things.
They're hard to
listen to.
Others have
terrible things
happening around
them.
They have parents
with Alzheimer's
or sick children.
There's not much
time left over for
their personal
concerns.
One time a
client who I had
been seeing for a
few months came
into my office for
her scheduled
appointment, and
after some brief
preliminaries, she
announced,
I think I was
raped.
It is not easy to
know how to respond
to a statement like
that, although there
is frequently some
mystery around such
events.
Often alcohol is
involved, as it is in
most sexual assault
cases.
alcohol can cause
ambiguity.
That's partly why
people drink.
Alcohol temporarily
lifts the terrible
burden of self-consciousness
from people.
Drunk people know
about the future,
but they don't care
about it.
That's exciting.
That's exhilarating.
Drunk people can party
like there's no
tomorrow.
But, because there is a
tomorrow, most of the
time, drunk people also
get in trouble.
They black out.
They go to dangerous
places with careless
people.
They have fun, but they
also get raped.
So, I immediately
thought something like
that might be involved.
How else to
understand?
I think.
But that wasn't the
end of the story.
She added an extra
detail.
Five times.
The first sentence was
awful enough, but the
second produced
something unfathomable.
Five times.
What could that
possibly mean?
My client told me that
she would go to a bar
and have a few drinks.
Someone would start to
talk with her.
She would end up at his
place or her place with
him.
The evening would proceed
inevitably to its sexual
climax.
The next day she would
wake up uncertain about
what happened, uncertain
about her motives, uncertain
about his motives, and
uncertain about the world.
Miss S, we'll call her, was
vague to the point of
non-existence.
She was a ghost of a
person.
She dressed, however, like
a professional.
She knew how to present
herself for first
appearances.
In consequence, she had
finagled her way onto a
government advisory board
considering the
construction of a major
piece of transportation
infrastructure, even
though she knew nothing
about government, advising,
or construction.
She also hosted a local
public access radio show
dedicated to small
business, even though she
had never held a real job
and knew nothing about
being an entrepreneur.
She had been receiving
welfare payments for the
entirety of her adulthood.
Her parents had never
provided her with a minute
of attention.
She had four brothers, and
they were not at all good
to her.
She had no friends now, and
none in the past.
She had no partner.
She had no one to talk
to, and she didn't know
how to think on her own.
That's not rare.
She had no self.
She was instead a walking
cacophony of unintegrated
experiences.
I had tried previously to
help her find a job.
I asked her if she had a
CV.
She said yes.
I asked her to bring it to
me.
She brought it to our next
session.
It was 50 pages long.
It was in a file folder
box divided into sections
with manila tag separators,
the ones with the little
colorful index markers on
the sides.
The sections included such
topics as my dreams and
books I have read.
She had written down
dozens of her nighttime
dreams in the my dreams
section and provided brief
summaries and reviews of her
reading material.
This was what she proposed
to send to prospective
employers, or perhaps
already had.
Who really knew?
It is impossible to
understand how much
someone has to be no one
at all to exist in a world
where a file folder box
containing 50 indexed pages
listing dreams and novels
constitutes a CV.
Miss S knew nothing about
herself.
She knew nothing about other
individuals.
She knew nothing about the
world.
She was a movie played out
of focus, and she was
desperately waiting for a
story about herself to make
it all make sense.
If you add some sugar to
cold water and stir it, the
sugar will dissolve.
If you heat up that water,
you can dissolve more.
If you heat the water to
boiling, you can add a lot
more sugar and get that to
dissolve, too.
Then, if you take that
boiling sugar water and
slowly cool it, and don't
bump it or jar it, you can
trick it, I don't know how
else to phrase this, into
holding a lot more dissolved
sugar than it would have if
it had remained cold all
along.
That's called a
supersaturated solution.
If you drop a single crystal
of sugar into that
supersaturated solution, all the
excess sugar will suddenly and
dramatically crystallize.
It's as if it were crying out
for order.
That was my client.
People like her are the
reason that the many forms of
psychotherapy currently
practiced all work.
People can be so confused that
their psyches will be ordered
and their lives improved by the
adoption of any reasonably
orderly system of
interpretation.
This is the bringing together of
the disparate elements of their
lives in a disciplined manner.
Any disciplined manner.
So, if you have come apart at
the seams, or if you have never
been together at all, you can
restructure your life on
Freudian, Jungian, Adlerian,
Rogerian, or behavioral
principles.
At least then you make sense.
At least then you're coherent.
At least then you might be good for
something, if not good yet for
everything.
You can't fix a car with an axe,
but you can cut down a tree.
That's still something.
At about the same time I was
seeing this client, the media was
all afire with stories of
recovered memories, particularly
of sexual assault.
The dispute raged apace.
Were these genuine accounts of
past trauma?
Or were they post-hoc constructs,
dreamed up as a consequence of
pressure wittingly or unwittingly
applied by incautious therapists,
grasped onto desperately by
clinical clients, all too eager to
find a simple cause for all their
trouble?
Sometimes it was the former,
perhaps, and sometimes the latter.
I understood much more clearly and
precisely, however, how easy it might
be to instill a false memory into the
mental landscape as soon as my client
revealed her uncertainty about her
sexual experiences.
The past appears fixed, but it's not.
Not in an important psychological sense.
There is an awful lot to the past,
after all, and the way we organize it
can be subject to drastic revision.
Imagine, for example, a movie where
nothing but terrible things happen.
But in the end, everything works out.
Everything is resolved.
A sufficiently happy ending can change
the meaning of all the previous events.
They can all be viewed as worthwhile,
given that ending.
Now, imagine another movie.
A lot of things are happening.
They're all exciting and interesting.
But there are a lot of them.
Ninety minutes in, you start to worry.
This is a great movie, you think.
But there are a lot of things going on.
I sure hope the filmmaker can pull it
all together.
But that doesn't happen.
Instead, the story ends abruptly,
unresolved, or something facile and
cliched occurs.
You leave deeply annoyed and unsatisfied,
failing to notice that you were fully
engaged and enjoying the movie
almost the whole time you were in the
theater.
The present can change the past,
and the future can change the present.
When you are remembering the past,
as well, you remember some parts of it
and forget others.
You have clear memories of some things
that happened, but not others of
potentially equal import,
just as in the present you are aware
of some aspects of your surroundings
and unconscious of others.
You categorize your experience,
grouping some elements together
and separating them from the rest.
There is a mysterious arbitrariness
about all of this.
You don't form a comprehensive,
objective record.
You can't.
You just don't know enough.
You just can't perceive enough.
You're not objective either.
You're alive.
You're subjective.
You have vested interests,
at least in yourself,
at least usually.
What exactly should be included?
