Introduction
Yuval Noah Harari's book,
Sapiens,
is the macro-history,
big and long-term historical events,
of the development of Homo sapiens.
The book progresses generally
in a linear fashion.
However,
there are some pages
where it jumps across time periods
to connect similar phenomena.
It explains how the world
has come to be the way it is
by describing the various revolutions
that shaped the human history.
As an added advantage,
the book also reimagines the history
with a different turnout of events.
At the end of the book,
Sapiens gives a warning
that modern humans
have become gods
because they are capable
of starting new evolutionary paths
and end them as well.
This includes
our own historical path.
This book is based on facts
backed up by research,
but involves a bit of hypothesizing as well.
In the book,
Harari sometimes states
that an idea is simply a theory
and not yet proven.
However,
in some situations,
he states his opinions
as if they are absolute.
This book also contains exaggerations
that will benefit
from the reader's further scrutiny
and fact-checking.
Despite these drawbacks,
the book contains ample insight
that will satisfy those
who want to deeply understand
human history
from beginning to the end.
Harari also shares
his own feelings with the readers,
like the fact that
Guns, Germs, and Steel,
1997,
by Jared Diamond,
is one of his greatest inspirations
for writing the book.
According to him,
Jared's book taught him
that it was possible
to ask the big questions
and answer them through science.
Likewise,
Sapiens goes beyond
discussing mere historical facts.
He attempts to draw insights from it
to answer essential queries like
what is the differences
between Homo sapiens
and other species,
whether history has a direction,
if people became happier
throughout time,
and other fascinating topics.
It provides new perspectives
that give a more holistic understanding
of who we are as a species.
Sapiens was originally written in Hebrew
and published in Israel
in 2011.
It was translated into English
in 2014.
It has been translated
into more than
twenty languages so far
and has gained worldwide recognition
for being such an insightful book.
about the author
Yuval Noah Harari
is an Israeli historian
who was raised
by a non-religious
Eastern European family.
He first studied military
and medieval history
at Jerusalem's Hebrew University
from 1993 to 1998.
He received his doctorate
from the Oxford University
in 2002
under the guidance
of Professor Stephen J. Gunn.
He continued his postdoctoral studies
in history
as a fellow
of Yad Hanadev,
a philanthropic foundation
in Israel.
He now focuses
on world history
and macro-historical processes.
Aside from Sapiens,
Harari has published
several notable books
about history,
such as
Special Operations
in the Age of Chivalry,
1100 to 1550,
Renaissance Military Memoirs,
War, History, and Identity,
1450 to 1600,
The Ultimate Experience,
Battlefield Revelations,
and the Making of Modern War Culture,
1450 to 2000,

Coffee, and Authority,
Eyewitnesses,
and Flesh Witnesses
Speak About War,
1100 to 2000,
Homo Deus,
A Brief History of Tomorrow.
Harari has given
a free online course
titled
A Brief History of Humankind.
This course elaborated
on the information
given in the book.
More than 100,000 people
all over the world
enrolled for the course.
The Book at a Glance
Sapiens is a book
about the development
of Homo sapiens,
a term that means
wise man,
from being
an animal with
no significance
to
the animal
that became a god.
The book reviews
thousands of years
of history,
considers diverse
empires and cultures,
and relates them
in an engaging
and easy-to-understand manner.
Human history is complex,
and there are many things
we don't know about it
because of the lack
of artifacts
or other reliable evidence,
but the author says
that it can generally
be grouped
into three revolutions.
The Cognitive Revolution,
the Agricultural Revolution,
and the Scientific Revolution.
These three
has influenced
almost everything
about humankind.
We are currently
in the Scientific Revolution,
a period
that has turned us
into gods,
but at the same time
made us extremely
vulnerable
to our own selves.
The Cognitive Revolution
took place
70,000 years ago
when humans gained
the ability
to speak
and create myths.
This is supported
by the development
of larger-than-normal
brains in humans,
a result of using
fire to cook food.
Because of this increase
in intelligence,
humans surpassed animals
and outwitted
other human species.
They understood
their environment,
communicated the information
to others,
and collaborated
in tasks
that require
a large number
of individuals.
Eventually,
they eliminated
the human
and animal competition,
not because
they were fitter,
but because
they were smarter.
Other human species
became extinct,
and as people
dominated the land,
so did vast numbers
of the local flora
and fauna.
After a few thousand years,
Homo sapiens
topped the food chain.
Since this process
normally takes
millions of years,
the ecosystem
is not ready for it,
and the same
is with the Homo sapiens.
Thus,
these wise men
are anxious
and prone
to making mistakes,
with some of them
great enough
to affect
the course of history.
The agricultural revolution
occurred
ten thousand years ago,
when people learned
how to farm lands
and to
domesticate animals.
This caused them
to leave their
nomadic
and hunter-gathering ways
in favor of
semi-permanent
to permanent shelters.
These settlements
eventually grew
into cities,
towns,
and empires,
thanks to the
incredible ability
of common myths
to unite people.
Eventually,
conquests resulted
into smaller cultures
merging into
megacultures,
which inevitably
led to
one world culture.
It has also
fashioned the
economic systems
that supported
humankind's
speedy progress.
The scientific revolution
began five hundred
years ago
and is currently
ongoing.
It is spurred
by imperialistic
desires to know
more and to
conquer bigger
territory.
Capitalism,
a product of
the agricultural
revolution,
developed a
relentless pursuit
of profit,
spurring scientific
researches that
provide profitable
applications.
At the same time,
the improvement
of technology
bestowed endless
comforts upon
people who
developed cravings
for things they
don't really need.
Overall,
humankind is
wealthier and
more powerful
than at any
point in history,
but we are not
really as happy
as our ancestors.
We need to
think hard about
what we really
want so as to
avoid endangering
ourselves,
especially now
that we can not
only guide history,
but we can end
it altogether.
Part 1.
The Cognitive
Revolution
Chapter 1.
An Animal
of No Significance
Everything came
into being about
thirteen point five
billion years in the
distant past
during the Big Bang.
Only physics can
be used to
describe this
story.
Three hundred
thousand years
later, energy
and matter began
to form atoms
and molecules.
Chemistry relates
the story of
molecules and
molecular interactions.
Three point eight
billion years ago,
some molecules
collected to
build organisms
on the planet
Earth.
Biology narrates
the story of
organisms.
Seventy thousand
years ago,
organisms from
the species
Homo sapiens
formed much
more complex
structures we
now call
cultures.
History expresses
human cultures'
subsequent
development.
Human history
is influenced
by three
incredible
revolutions.
The Cognitive
Revolution that
took place
seventy thousand
years in the
past,
the Agricultural
Revolution set
at twelve
thousand years
ago,
and the
Scientific
Revolution,
a mere
five hundred
years ago.
This book
explains how
these revolutions
have affected
humans and
other organisms
on the planet.
Humans,
animals of the
genus Homo,
have existed
long before
history,
and they lived
with animals
for a long
time without
standing apart
from them.
Biologists
group and
name organisms
by their genus
and species.
animals are
from the same
species if
they mate
and give
birth to
offspring that
can bear
children.
We are
called Homo
sapiens,
of the genus
Homo,
meaning man,
and species
sapiens,
meaning wise,
and we belong
to the family
of great apes.
It is
believed that
six million
years ago,
a female ape
gave birth to
two daughters.
One became
the ancestor
of all
present-day
chimpanzees,
while the
other became
Homo sapiens'
grandmother.
Humans first
evolved in
Africa 2.5
million years
ago from a
previous genus
called
Astrolothopithecus,
or southern
ape.
Two million
years ago,
these early
humans left
Africa and
traveled to
Europe and
Asia.
Because of
the varying
conditions in
settlement places,
humans evolved.
Those in
Europe and
Western Asia
became Homo
Neanderthalinesis,
or Neanderthals,
man from the
Neander Valley.
Those in
Eastern Asia
became Homo
Erectus,
meaning upright
man.
Those on the
island of
Java in
Indonesia became
Homo
Solanesis,
man from the
Solo Valley.
Last but not
least, those
in Flores
Island became
Homo
Floricensis.
Of these,
Homo
Erectus
survived the
longest.
While these
humans were in
Europe and
Asia, the
ones left in
East Africa
continued to
evolve into
numerous species
such as
Homo
Rodolphinus,
man from
Lake Rudolf,
Homo
ergaster,
working man,
and eventually
Homo sapiens,
wise man.
As you can
see, human
evolution is
not linear.
From about
two million
years up to
ten thousand
years ago,
several human
species coexisted.
Humans have
large brains
compared to
their body
size, which
uses 25% of
the body's
entire energy
supply.
In comparison,
other apes
only need
8%.
This bigger,
energy-hungry
brain came
at a price.
Humans had
to spend
more time
getting food
and their
muscles
atrophied.
Despite this,
the human
brain has
proven to
be an
asset for
the Homo
sapiens.
Another thing
that worked
to our
advantage is
our ability
to walk
upright.
It freed
our hands,
so we were
able to do
more things
like signaling
and tool
production.
Again,
this had
some drawbacks.
Humans lost
their superior
vision, and
we can have
problems such
as stiff
back and
neck because
of our
extra-large
head.
Women have
more of the
burden.
An upright
gait requires
narrower hips,
but human
babies' heads
are bigger.
Because of
this,
evolution favored
earlier births
when their heads
are still supple.
Thus,
humans are
born helpless.
Unlike other
animals'
offspring.
The result of
this is that
humans became
social creatures
who take care
of each other.
Ancient humans
were at the
middle of the
food chain up
to 400,000
years ago,
and they
reached the
top 100,000
years ago.
Normally,
animals at the
top of a
food chain only
achieve the
feat after
millions of
years, while
humans reach the
peak comparatively
quickly.
Hence, the rest
of the food
chain, and the
humans likewise,
aren't used to
this.
Thus, we are
prone to making
bad decisions
throughout history.
The domestication
of fire,
estimated to start
from 800,000 to
300,000 years ago,
and cooking food,
may have enabled
humans to evolve
the big brain,
while eliminating
parasites, and
preparing food
permitted the
humans to eat
different types
of food.
It also allowed
a smaller
intestinal tract,
which allowed
the brain to
grow bigger.
Aside from
this, using
fire as a
weapon increased
humans' edge
over other
animals.
Even if early
humans learned
to use fire
for their benefit,
they were still
marginal creatures
around 150,000
years ago.
Scientists don't
know when
Homo sapiens
first evolved from
other human
types,
but they
agree that
150,000 years
ago, East
Africa was
populated by
them.
They also
agree that
70,000 years
ago, they
spread from
East Africa to
the Arabian
Peninsula and
to the Eurasia
landmass.
When Homo sapiens
reached Arabia,
most of
Eurasia was
already populated
by other
humans.
There are two
main theories of
how Homo sapiens
evolved.
The interbreeding
theory says that
sapiens bred with
Neanderthals, while
the replacement
theory states that
they kill them
off.
It's also possible
that a combination
of these two have
occurred.
Eventually, many
species of humans
have become extinct
except Homo sapiens.
The author says
that Homo sapiens
have settled so
rapidly in diverse
habitats, pushed
other species to
extinction, and
conquered the world
because of its
unique language.
Chapter 2.
The Tree of
Knowledge.
70,000 years
ago, Homo sapiens
left Africa for the
second time, but
this time they
drove all other
human species into
extinction.
In a short time,
sapiens reached
Europe and East
Asia.
They crossed the
sea and landed in
Australia 45,000
years ago.
The period between
70,000 to 30,000
years ago has seen
the invention of
boats, oil lamps,
needles, bows,
arrows, art
objects, and so
much more.
During this time,
the first concrete
evidence of
religion, commerce,
and social
stratification
appeared.
Most researchers
believe that these
accomplishments were
the product of new
ways of thinking and
communicating among
Homo sapiens.
This marks the
cognitive revolution.
They are not sure
why this happened, but
some believe that it's
caused by random
genetic mutations that
change the wiring of
the brain of Homo
sapiens.
This can be called the
Tree of Knowledge
mutation.
Although animals have a
form of language,
Homo sapiens' language
enabled them to
communicate, store, and
absorb a vast amount of
information about the
environment.
With this information, the
members of the tribe can
brainstorm and cooperate
with one another on
various tasks.
Gossip is another byproduct
of this unique language.
Because social cooperation
is essential for the
survival of Homo sapiens'
survival and
reproduction, individuals
needed to know about
their companions, such as
who is trustworthy and
who is not, who is an
enemy, who are mates,
etc.
Only Homo sapiens can
discuss things that are
not tangible, such as
fantasies, legends, myths,
deities, and religions.
The ability to talk about
fiction is unique in
Homo sapiens' language.
Fiction has allowed
Homo sapiens to imagine
things individually and
collectively.
Telling stories and myths
allowed numerous individuals
to cooperate in a variety
of ways.
Members of a coalition
spend time together and
help each other.
The number of members that
can be formed and
maintained has limits.
For a group to function
well, all group members
must know each other
well.
Chimps are unable to form
groups with more than
50 members.
As the number increases,
the social order decreases
and factions form.
The human groups can reach
around 150.
These groups are bonded by
interaction and
communication, which
includes gossip.
Beyond this number, it's
hard to maintain
cohesiveness from
communication alone.
Fortunately, humans
manage to work in groups
comprised of a thousand
members and beyond because
of common myths.
Thus, members of the same
state, religion, tribe, and
city can collaborate on the
same goal, even if they
haven't met each other
before.
This is because they can
agree on things like
religion, laws, justice,
nations, human rights, and
money, even if these things
only exist in their
collective imaginations.
These enabled people to
trade and to build
corporations.
Since the cognitive
revolution, humans existed
in the physical and
imagined reality.
As time went by, the
imagined reality became
powerful enough to affect
how people think and act.
How a group of people works
with each other can be
affected by changing the
stories that they believe
in.
As an example, the
French population changed
dramatically in 1789 when
they stopped believing in
the myth of kings' divine
rights and believed the myth
of the people's sovereignty
instead.
At the end of cognitive
revolution, Homo sapiens
were able to modify their
behavior rapidly when their
needs changed.
They didn't need to wait for
millions of years for a
genetic or environmental
change to happen.
Thus, they zipped past all
other humans and animal
species in their ability to
cooperate with each other.
Chapter 3. A Day in the
Life of Adam and Eve
According to evolutionary
psychology, our psychological
and social characteristics are
shaped during the pre-agricultural
era.
Even if modern technology has
increased our lifespan and gave
us access to more material
resources, we still have the
minds of a hunter-gatherer.
Thus, to understand things about
us like our eating habits,
sexuality, and conflict, it helps
to look back in history on how
things were thousands of years
ago.
For instance, craving high-calorie
foods are embedded in the DNA.
Food rich in calories used to be
rare and hard to find, so the
instinct to immediately consume
it is programmed into the genes.
Modern times have made food
readily available, but the
instinct has remained.
Thus, people are prone to
overeat.
Ever since the agricultural
revolution, humans didn't have a
predominant way of life.
There are vast cultural
differences, even among people
living under the same ecological
conditions, because of the ability
to create different imagined
realities, values, and norms.
Before the agricultural
revolution, Homo sapiens' tribes
were isolated from one another,
even though they participated in a
common activity every once in a
while.
They were nomadic, moving from place
to place to find food.
Tribe members were close to one
another, and though they didn't have
much privacy, they were also less
lonely.
They first learned to tame animals
by domesticating dogs 15,000 years
ago.
These dogs helped them to hunt food
and provide security.
Eventually, they managed to tame other
animals as well.
In places with plenty of food
supplies, the tribes settled seasonally
and sometimes permanently.
Food preservation techniques enabled
them to stay longer.
Fishing villages were one of the first
settlements, and they may have initiated
transoceanic journeys, such as the
invasion of Australia.
Ancient humans did not only forge food,
but knowledge as well.
They were more aware of their physical
environment as compared to us.
Contrary to common belief, they were
not unintelligent.
Currently, humans now know more than
what our ancestors 15,000 years ago
knew.
However, as individuals, our knowledge
is highly specialized into a few
things.
Thus, we have to rely on other
experts, whose knowledge are
likewise specialized.
Scavengers worked fewer hours in a
week compared to the modern humans,
and were fitter than modern humans,
too.
Thus, the author argues that we have
made a mistake when we turned away
from this way of life.
Aside from this, agriculture and
industry made it easier for people to
depend on one another to survive,
instead of being self-reliant like the
old times.
Researchers don't know much about
foragers' religion, but they theorize
that they were animists, who believed
that every plant, animal, place, and
natural phenomenon has feelings and
awareness.
They also did not know much about their
socio-political world, but fossils and
artifacts hint at how it might have been
years ago.
Chapter 4.
The Flood
Humans traveling across the sea and
arriving in Australia 45,000 years ago
is considered as one of the most
important expeditions.
It is the time when humans scaled the
food chain.
After a few thousand years, 23 out of
24 animal species in the continent
became extinct.
800 years ago, the Maures colonized the
New Zealand islands, and their arrival
also marked the disappearance of most of
the animals there.
Mammoths in Wrangell Island in the
Arctic Ocean were wiped out 10,000 years
ago when Homo sapiens spread over Eurasia
and North America.
This reveals that sapiens have a
destructive effect on the ecology of the
place they inhabit.
It is theorized that they burned forests to
create farmlands, thus contributing to mass
extinctions.
Because Homo sapiens learned to create clothes and
shoes against the winter, they could migrate to
colder places like Siberia, even if their bodies
were adapted to conditions in the African savannah.
They gradually reached the eastern United States,
the Mississippi Delta, Mexico, and Central
America, when the global temperatures rose and
glaciers, blocking their way, melted.
The settling of the humans in America represents the
most rapid invasion of a single species.
By 10,000 BC, Homo sapiens occupied the entire landmass of
America.
Within 2,000 years after their arrival, most of the
species in it were gone.
Other ecological disasters took place in almost every
island across the seas.
The first wave of extinction took place during the invasion of
the foragers, while the second wave of extinction came with the
spread of the farmers.
The third wave of extinction is currently being caused by
industrial activity.
During the cognitive and agricultural revolutions,
only the land animals were affected by human activities.
However, in our modern day, sea animals are also doomed because of
pollution and overuse of oceanic resources.
If this trend continues, the only survivors of the human flood will be
the Homo sapiens.
For 2.5 million years, Homo sapiens consumed food that grew without their
intervention.
They spread from East Africa to the Middle East, Europe, Asia, Australia, and
America, gathering plants and hunting animals.
That changed 10,000 years ago, when they began to manipulate plant and animal
species to gain more fruit, grain, and meat, which heralded the dawn of the
agricultural revolution.
The agricultural revolution rose independently in several parts of the
world.
Various plants and animal species were domesticated.
Goats, dogs, wheat, peas, lentils, olive trees, horses, grapevines, camels, cashew nuts, and more.
By 3,500 BC, the main wave of domestication halted.
Nowadays, 90% of calories come from what our ancestors have domesticated around
9,500 to 3,500 BC.
These are wheat, corn, rice, potatoes, barley, and millet.
Our minds are from hunter-gatherers, while our cuisine is from ancient farmers.
Not all plants and animals were suited for domestication, though, as agricultural
revolutions only occurred in places where sapiens have managed to domesticate the
flora and fauna.
Scholars have claimed that the agricultural revolution was a significant leap forward for
humanity because it produced more intelligent people.
However, there is no evidence that modern humans became more intelligent through time.
Ironically, the first few thousand years of the agricultural revolution made life harder
because it created more work, less time for leisure, and an increasing population that required
more food.
It also turned some individuals into elites that were pampered by workers.
These unfavorable conditions were not caused by people but some plant species that includes
rice, wheat, and potatoes.
The author claims that they domesticated Homo sapiens rather than the other way around.
Because human bodies were not adapted to farming, various ailments like slipped discs, hernias,
and arthritis plagued farmers.
Also, it forced them to settle and guard their farms, even if they can get better food through
hunting and gathering.
Agricultural village life did provide benefits, though.
It protected people from wild animals and harsh weather, and caused people to be less violent
to one another.
The agricultural revolution did not improve the life of the average person at first.
However, it did enable humans to gather more food per unit area.
Thus, the overall population increased exponentially.
Even if individuals were not really happier or healthier, they were able to pass on more genes.
Thus, the agricultural revolution can be considered as an evolutionary success, even if it was a trap.
Each generation didn't notice how things are becoming worse, because these changes were gradual.
They didn't see that becoming too dependent on wheat robbed them of nutrition, forced them
to work harder, and required them to guard their storehouses.
They didn't return to the old ways, because working on the farm took a lot of time.
They just thought that they are doing a good thing by making a lot of food.
In history, luxuries tend to become necessities that create new obligations.
When people learn to enjoy the new luxuries, they become dependent on them.
The agricultural revolution's evolutionary success, a greater population, was the cause for much
suffering inflicted upon humans and domesticated animals such as chickens, pigs, cattle, and sheep.
These animals are often treated cruelly.
Similar to Homo sapiens, even if the cattle are continuously bred and are successful evolutions,
it does not mean that they are happier.
Chapter 6. Building Pyramids
The agricultural revolution has created people who are greedy and who are alienated from nature and their fellow humans.
It has caused people to be stuck in places that are good for yielding crops, forcing them to stay on a mere 2% of the earth's surface.
This revolution became the time when worrying about the future became common.
Before this, people were rarely concerned, since they couldn't do much about it.
The advent of agriculture meant that people can do something about the future.
Thus, they gained more obligations.
Farming became the basis of large-scale social and political systems.
Unfortunately, the peasants did not achieve future economic security.
Elites and rulers lived off the surplus food the farmers produced and gave back very little.
Food surplus and transportation technology enabled people to live together in large villages,
which grew into towns, cities, and kingdoms.
These alone were not enough to make them live together effectively, though.
An imagined order must be made to make thousands of people believe in the same ideas for them to understand one another,
and work towards the same goals.
To make people believe in an imagined order, it should not be admitted that it's imaginary,
but an objective reality dictated by the laws of nature or by the gods.
It should also be incorporated in education and to everything that people encounter.
To fairy tales, songs, architecture, fashion, political propaganda, etc.
It's quite difficult for people to realize that the imagined order is indeed imaginary because
it is reflected upon material reality.
It shapes desires, and it exists in an inter-subjective reality
that it is maintained by several thousands of people.
The myths surrounding us and making up our lives influence a lot of what we believe in and what we do.
A lot of people spent their lives building pyramids of varying names, sizes, and shapes,
depending on the culture, even if they were not sure why they did so.
To change the imagined order, it should be replaced by an even more powerful order,
and that is why there is no way out of it.
Breaking down the prison walls simply means escaping into the yard of a bigger prison.
Chapter 7 Memory Overload
Sapiens' social order is imagined so they can't preserve the information by embedding it in the DNA
and passing it to their children.
Because of this, they need to consciously make efforts to preserve the social order
by sustaining laws and customs.
Empires generated vast amounts of information,
which went far beyond what individuals can memorize.
Thus, humans searched for a way to keep information
so they do not become dependent upon individual brains
and the answer to their problem.
Writing
Aside from storing information,
writing was invented to record numbers because
human brains did not evolve to handle numbers well.
It is much more suited for remembering
It is much more suited for remembering
zoological, botanical, social, biological, and typographical information
because of Sapiens' evolutionary history.
To overcome the problem of storing large amounts of data,
including numbers,
the Sumerians invented writing between 3,500 through 3,000 BC.
Writing changed man's thought process
and has enabled us to keep records and think categorically.
It has preserved information beyond what the mind can retain
and the genes can encode.
The first Sumerian historical texts
were limited to figures and facts.
They are economic documents detailing things like
property ownership, tax payments, and debt accumulation.
This is because writing consumed a lot of time
and there were only a few who could read.
Sumerian writing started out as a partial script
that could not fully express their language
but dealt with limited functions
such as recording figures and performing calculations.
Gradually, more signs were added to it
until it evolved into a full script
also known as a cuneiform script.
Since then, more documents were written.
Aside from the Sumerians,
different cultures invented their own system of writing.
They also found ways to achieve,
catalog, process, and retrieve records.
Because of writing,
Homo sapiens began to think differently.
They learned how to think beyond free association
and think categorically.
They also gained the ability to handle numbers.
Chapter 8
There is no justice in history
Humans have organized themselves in networks
requiring mass cooperation
by creating scripts and imagined orders.
These orders were not fair
because they divided people into groups
that were ranked in a hierarchy.
The top levels had power and privileges
while those on the bottom were oppressed and discriminated.
Examples include the caste system of India
and racial discrimination in America.
The imagined hierarchies are put in place
by dominant people
to preserve their position in society.
To make people accept these structures,
mythology, laws, and assumptions are quoted.
The hierarchical ranks are deliberately separated from each other
to keep everyone in their proper place.
Intermarriages are prohibited
and the rise of status of a low-ranking individual
almost never happens.
Hierarchies tend to create vicious cycles
that can go on for hundreds or even thousands of years.
For instance,
Americans imported the blacks from Africa
because they were cheaper and fitter.
These slaves were often treated harshly
and labeled as an inferior race.
This made them rebellious,
prompting the whites to set discriminatory laws
to control them.
Due to these laws,
the slaves grew poor
and remained uneducated.
The people developed cultural prejudices about them,
leading to more discriminatory laws
and dire conditions for the blacks.
There is also inequality among the genders.
Historically,
men were treated better than women,
with some cultures
even considering wives
as the property of their husbands.
Men dominated ruling positions
while women were not allowed to vote
for a long time.
A few theories have attempted
to explain this gender inequality.
One says that men have evolved
to be more dominant than women
because those who are not strong enough
get killed off more easily.
Also,
their greater power meant
that they were better
in manual labor
such as plowing and harvesting.
Thus,
they were in control of the food supply,
giving them a political clout.
They could easily
have forced women
into submission as well.
This is problematic
because physical power
does not always translate
to social power.
The elderly
often has authority
over those in their twenties,
even if the latter
are physically more capable.
rulers were often
not the strongest
or most violent,
but possessed
great social skills.
Again,
scholars are not sure
as to why most societies
are patriarchal
and dominated by men,
but the good thing is
that women
are now treated
more equally.
part three,
the unification
of mankind.
Chapter nine,
the arrow of history.
All human cultures
have inconsistencies
within them.
For example,
the medieval Europe
believed in Christianity
and chivalry.
People throughout the world
struggle to reconcile
with the terms
liberty and equality
ever since
the French Revolution.
Contemporary Americans
are divided between
Democrats and Republicans.
This is not something
really bad
because they make people
think critically
and encourage creativity
and dynamism
in the culture.
Scholars used to think
that cultures are static,
but they eventually realize
that they constantly change.
The changes may be due
to the environment
or the influence
of an invader.
However,
sometimes it can happen
without these two factors.
Overall,
cultures are moving
towards unity.
For example,
there used to be
thousands of separate
human worlds on Earth
during 10,000 BC,
but they dwindled
in number
by 1450 BC.
At that point,
90% of humans
lived in one mega world,
Afro-Asia.
The remaining 10%
was divided
among four worlds.
The Mesoamerican world,
Central America
and portions
of North America,
the Andine world,
most of Western
South America,
the Australian world,
Australia,
and the Oceanic world,
islands in the
Southwest Pacific Ocean.
The Afro-Asia world
gobbled up
the Mesoamerican world
in 1521
when the Spanish
invaded the Aztec Empire
and the Oceanic world
where Ferdinand Magellan
circumvented the globe.
The Andine world
was defeated
in 1532
when the Spanish
conquistadors
toppled the Inca Empire.
The British
colonized Australia
in 1788.
Fifteen years later,
they settled
in Tasmania.
Thus,
all human worlds
were brought into
the Afro-Asian
sphere of influence.
The first millennium
B.C.
has witnessed
the development
of three
potentially
universal orders.
The Economic
Monetary Order,
the Political
Imperial Order,
and
the Religious Order.
Merchants,
conquerors,
and prophets
believed
that they could bring
the entire human race
under the same set
of laws that would
apply to everyone
wherever they may be
in the world.
The last few centuries
have led to the growth
of empires
and the intensification
of trade,
which have contributed
to increasing levels
of global unification.
The next chapter
tells the readers
how each of these orders
has influenced history.
Chapter 10
The Cent of Money
People used to border
goods,
which presented problems
because of several reasons.
Traders had to constantly
adjust their exchange rates,
items being traded
were sometimes unwanted,
and many material goods
were hard to transport.
To solve these issues,
money was invented.
The first kinds of money
to be used
were cowrie shells,
barley,
and metallic coins.
These were easier
to handle
compared to
random items.
With the exception
of barley,
the coins and shells
do not have
a physical value
to them.
Barley can be eaten,
but they contained
an imagined value
that is trusted
by those
who use them,
and this value
was convertible
to a list
of other things.
Because money
required people's trust,
rulers and authorities
made sure
that the money
that their people used
was usable.
Counterfeiting money
resulted in severe
punishments
to deter cheaters.
People from different
religions and cultures
learned to use
various kinds of money.
This resulted
in the worldwide
acceptance of money.
Nowadays,
most of the people's money
is purely intellectual,
with only 10%
existing in
physical form,
and 90%
in electronic form.
Despite this,
complex commercial networks
and dynamic markets
thrive.
The author claims
that money has become
the apodge
of human tolerance.
Ironically, though,
it has also caused
people to be heartless.
People have learned
to sacrifice
priceless values
like loyalty
and empathy
for the sake of money,
and the things
that can be bought
by it.
Chapter 11
Imperial Visions
An empire
is a political order
ruling over
a vast number
of people
with distinct
cultural identities
and territories.
It has
flexible borders
and a potentially
unlimited appetite.
The world has seen
many empires
throughout history.
The Chinese
Quin Dynasty Empire,
the Roman Empire,
the Akkadian Empire,
the Persian Empire,
the Aztec Empire,
and the British Empire
are some of them.
For the past
2,500 years,
empires have been
the most common form
of political organization
and were instrumental
in gathering
small cultures
and turning them
into bigger cultures.
Although there are
many disadvantages
of being conquered,
there are also
advantages.
The blending
of empires
often starts
a new culture.
This includes
architecture,
music,
art,
cuisine,
governance,
etc.
The imperial cycle
starts with a small group
establishing a big empire.
Along with this
is the forging
of a culture.
The Roman Empire
created the
Greco-Roman culture.
The Arab Caliphate
upheld an Arab
Muslim culture.
And the European
empires paved the way
for the Western culture.
The imperial culture
is adopted
by the subjects.
Thus,
the conquered
take up their
conquerors' language,
laws,
political ideas,
religions,
etc.
Although the subjects
tried to behave
like their masters,
they were considered
inferior
and treated
unfairly.
This led them
to demand
equal status
in the name
of common
imperial values,
Roman values,
Muslim values,
nationalism,
socialism,
human rights,
and so on.
After some time,
the empire's founders
lost their power
and the control
got transferred
to a multi-ethnic elite.
Despite the
dissolution
of the empire,
the imperial culture
continues to develop.
Thus,
the Ilyranians,
Gauls,
and Punic
continue the Roman culture,
the Egyptians,
Iranians,
and Berbers
keep the Muslim culture
alive,
while the Indians,
Africans,
and Chinese
maintain the Western culture.
Most of what we believe
is part of our own culture
was forced upon us
by other empires
that conquered
our ancestors.
As a whole,
we are now moving
towards one global empire.
There are numerous issues
that can only be
tackled effectively
when countries cooperate.
Issues such as
global markets,
global warming,
and human rights
require one
collective entity,
which may require
one world government.
Chapter 12
The Law of Religion
Religion is a system
of human values
and norms
that are based
on a belief
in a superhuman order.
Many say
that religion
divides people,
but it is actually
the third unifier
of mankind
aside from
empires and money.
It has two characteristics
that enable it
to unite
distinct groups
of humans
over a large territory.
It is believed
to be universal,
or always true
everywhere,
and missionary,
that it should be spread
to everyone.
The agricultural revolution
occurred along
with a religious revolution.
It is theorized
that when people
learned how to
control nature,
they invented gods
to help them
control it more
when they fail.
This led to the rise
of polytheism.
It's interesting
that polytheism
is more tolerant
of multiple beliefs,
even if it is
considered as less
enlightened
than the beliefs
people have today.
For polytheism,
there is a god
for everything,
and people can worship
any god they want.
This changed
when some religions
like Christianity
and Islam
decided that
one god
is above the rest.
Because they believed
that they knew
the ultimate truth,
they discredited
the belief
in other gods
and other imposed
violence
for over 2,000 years.
They also turned
the local gods
and goddesses
into saints
from their religion.
Buddhism is a religion
that does not
promote worship,
but instead advocates
the liberation
of man from suffering.
According to Buddhist belief,
the mind naturally
craves more,
and all suffering
arises from this craving.
The Buddha
prescribed guidelines
to help people
achieve enlightenment,
a reminder that
even if people
claim that Buddhism
is not a religion,
it still tells people
what to do
and believe.
The past 300 years
have witnessed
an increasing
secularism in the world.
This included
the progression
of ideologies
that are based
on natural law
such as communism,
nationalism,
capitalism,
and Nazism.
These are not
usually known
as religions,
but authors
consider them
as such
because they are
still systems
of values
and norms
founded on a belief
in a superhuman order.
Humanist religions
are those
that are said
to worship man.
The author says
that these arose
from monotheism.
Liberal humanism
believes
that humanity
resides in each individual,
homo sapiens,
and that people
should protect
to the core
and freedom
of each individual.
Socialist humanism
argues
that humanity
is collective
and thus
it's imperative
to protect equality
within the entire
homo sapiens species.
Evolutionary humanism
claims that humanity
is a mutable species
that might evolve
into superhumans
or degenerate
into subhumans.
Thus,
evolution should be
safeguarded
and de-evolution
prevented.
Nazis upheld
evolutionary humanism
and they fought
human rights,
communism,
and liberal humanism
to improve
the entire species
and prevent
its degeneration
into extinction.
They exterminated
many people
for this.
Thus,
it became taboo.
However,
even if exterminating
inferior kinds of people
is shunned,
many are still eager
to create superhumans.
Liberal,
political,
and judicial systems
are based on the belief
that a soul
must be protected.
However,
science has not found
any evidence
of the existence
of a soul so far.
The author ends
this chapter
wondering how long
the wall dividing
biology from law
and politics
can stand.
Chapter 13
The Secret of Success
Commerce,
empires,
and universal religions
gradually brought
virtually all sapiens
into a global world.
We can't say for sure
why they turned out
that way,
but we can study
a few things.
Describing how
something happened
involves recreating
the series of events
that led from
one instance to another.
Describing why
something took place
means finding
causal connections
that resulted
in this specific
series of events
and not others.
Some scholars
provide deterministic
explanations
to events
based on
biological,
ecological,
or economic
forces,
but most of them
are skeptical
of such theories.
They say that
the more that you
know about history,
the harder it may be
for you to explain
why one outcome
transpired
and not a different
one.
History cannot be
explained deterministically
because of its complexity,
and it cannot be
predicted as well
because many forces
are involved.
What seems obvious
in hindsight
is near impossible
to predict beforehand.
There are two kinds
of chaotic systems.
Level 1 is
not affected
by predictions
about it.
Example,
the weather
is not influenced
by weather forecasts,
while Level 2
is influenced
by predictions
about it.
For example,
reports about oil prices
will affect
the stock market.
History and politics
are second-order
chaotic systems.
Despite its
unpredictable nature,
history is still
worth studying,
not to determine
what will happen,
but to deepen
our understanding
of the present
situation
and our acceptance
of possibilities.
History is directed
by powerful,
impersonal dynamics
that are beyond
humans.
There is no evidence
that history
is benefiting humans
or humans'
well-being
over time.
The spread of cultures
is compared
to the spread
of an infectious disease.
It's still a question
as to whether history
will benefit
Homo sapiens
collectively.
Part 4.
The Scientific Revolution
Chapter 14
The Discovery
of Ignorance
The scientific revolution
began in Europe
approximately 500 years ago.
During this time,
humanity's impact
grew tremendously,
and, as of now,
we have achieved
an unparalleled progress.
The human population
grew 14-fold,
production 240-fold,
and energy consumption
115-fold.
We have circumnavigated
the Earth,
reached the Moon,
learned about microorganisms,
and defeated the diseases
that they cause.
Among the numerous events
of this period,
what the author considers
the most crucial
is the detonation
of the atomic bomb
in July of 1945
at Alamogordo, New Mexico.
Now, humans have
the capability
not only to affect history,
but to end it.
Supporting this revolution
is a feedback loop
powered by the mutual
reinforcement of science,
economics, and politics.
Economic and political
institutions fund research,
while science gives
new powers
to obtain new resources,
with some of these
being reinvested
to research.
Modern science
is different
from previous kinds
of knowledge
because of the
following traits.
The admittance
of not knowing,
the focus on observation
and mathematics,
and the acquirement
of new powers.
Science assumes
humankind does not
know the answers
to the important
questions in life,
while religion assumes
that they are
already known,
and all the answer
to these are absolute.
Previous cultures
and belief systems
created their theories
from traditions
and stories,
while science
formulated its theories
with observations
and mathematics.
It seeks to go beyond
what is previously known,
and, when necessary,
change them
to make them
more accurate.
At the time
of the Industrial Revolution
and the creation
of the capitalist system,
science,
industry,
and military technology
came together.
War provided the impetus
to create
more powerful weapons
and more reliable defenses,
sparking a lot
of scientific discoveries.
Scientific research
can thrive
only when supported
by an ideology
or religion.
Science justifies
the expenses
of the research,
and the ideology
determines
what to do
with the discoveries.
Chapter 15
The Marriage
of Science
and Empire
The West
dominated the last
one hundred years
because the Chinese
and Persians
lacked the myths,
values,
sociopolitical,
and judicial structures.
The European
imperialists
traveled across oceans
to seize new territory
and knowledge,
and discovering America
was the turning point
of the scientific revolution.
This sparked
their drive
to conquer
and explore.
The Spaniards,
headed by Pizarro
and Cortes,
committed genocide
within South America,
wiping out
the Aztec Empire.
Between 1750
and 1850,
Europe conquered
large areas
of Asia.
In 1950,
Western Europe
and the U.S.
increased
their global
production.
This has been
attributed
to their military
industrial
scientific complex,
a powerhouse
fueled by
the ideology
of exploration.
The exploration
missions of
James Cook,
Christopher Columbus,
Ferdinand Magellan,
and others
are more than
attempts
to expand
territory.
They also
brought back
important scientific
discoveries,
such as cures
for previously
incurable
illnesses,
translations
of hieroglyphics,
and Charles
Darwin's
theory of
evolution.
This new
knowledge has
led to a vast
array of
applications
that are now
benefiting
humankind.
The conquests
themselves are
based on
cleverness,
where they took
advantage of
their visitors,
and their
cluelessness of
what's happening
around them.
Even if the
conquerors were
fewer than
they conquered,
they had
superior technology
and acted
strategically.
Thus,
they were able
to conquer
the land
swiftly.
The author
claims that
Europe was
once on an
equal footing
with India,
China,
and the
Middle East,
in terms of
knowledge and
technology,
but the latter
did not have
the passion
for exploring
the unknown.
Because of
their drive
to discover
and conquer,
they learned
more things,
created more
technology,
which ultimately
gave them
more power
over the
rest of
the people.
Chapter
Sixteen
The Capitalist
Creed
The scientific
revolution is
funded by
capitalism.
The per capita
production skyrocketed
when capitalism
began.
Previously,
GDP increased
at a steady
pace because of
demographic expansion
and settlements
on new lands,
which changed
when humans
invented
credit system.
Credit allows
people to
borrow money
because we
believe that
the future
will be better
than today.
Thus,
opportunities can
open up if
people build
things in the
present using
the money which
they believe they
will make in the
future.
This is influenced
by the scientific
revolution and the
idea that progress
is possible.
people learned
that good
things can
come with
inventions,
discoveries,
and developments.
This created
trust in the
future that
there will be
better resources
and thus it
is okay to
borrow what
can be paid
later.
In the
pre-modern
economy,
there is
little trust
in the
future and
thus little
credit is
available,
which leads
to slow
growth and
less trust
in the future
until the
cycle is
repeated.
In contrast,
the modern
economy has
given much
trust in the
future,
enabling much
credit,
which opens
up opportunities
for fast
growth and
even more
trust.
Adam Smith
mentioned in
The Wealth of
Nations that
increasing private
profits is the
basis for
increasing
collective wealth.
However,
this only works
for the profits
that are not
hoarded but
reinvested in
new production.
When one
becomes richer,
one can help
everybody,
and hence
greed could be
good.
Capitalism is
about capital
or resources
invested in
production.
In the
pre-modern
economy,
production is
geared towards
profits in a
one-way process.
On the other
hand, the
modern economy,
production and
profits are
linked in a
cycle.
Production
creates profits,
which is
reinvested in
production,
leading to
additional
profits.
It is
religion that
says economic
growth is
essential because
freedom, justice,
and happiness need
a growth in the
economy.
European
imperialism was
likewise financed
by capitalism as
it is based on
credit rather than
taxes, and it is
guided by
capitalists who
want to receive
something in
return for their
investments.
Aside from that,
many important
events like the
Britain-China
Opium War,
Egypt paying off
its debt for the
Suez Canal, and
Greece's liberation
from Turkey are
influenced a lot by
capitalism and
politics.
Chapter 17.
The Wheels of
Industry
Everything
used to be
governed by
manpower and
animal power,
which was
determined by
food, which is
dependent on
photosynthesis.
Basically, humans
were limited to
what was available
to them.
When they learned
to convert energy
into another type
of energy, more
specifically, heat
into movement,
things changed a
lot.
The Industrial
Revolution has been
all about energy
conversion.
This started from
the invention of
the steam engine,
a device that
enabled speedy
transportation and
textile manufacturing.
Gunpowder led to
the development of
improved artillery and
electricity, and has
enabled us to do
things that have
never been done
before, even if we
don't understand it
that much yet.
As humans learn to
harness and convert
energy effectively,
they exploited
previously inaccessible
collections of raw
materials and
transported them to
distant locations.
They were also able
to invent and
discover completely
new materials.
Besides this, their
machines produced
numerous items and
perform a lot of
work without being
tired.
The author considers
the Industrial
Revolution as the
Second Agricultural
Revolution, because
machines have been
heavily applied in
agriculture.
agriculture, tractors
performed farmers'
duties, fields and
animals yielded more
products, food storage
and transportation
became more
convenient.
Although this created
an abundance of food
for humans, it has
oppressed all the
other species.
Since the modern
capitalist economy needs
to constantly increase
production to maintain
itself, it also
acquired a need for
consumers, which gave
birth to consumerism.
Thus, people were
made to buy stuff they
don't really need and
things that can even
harm them at times.
Like religion, people
are promised good
things when they follow
the capitalist
consumerist ideal, but
the truth is, only the
greedy rich can benefit,
while the poor remains
enslaved to the system of
needing more and buying
more.
Chapter 18, A
Permanent Revolution
The Industrial Revolution
has liberated humankind
from its dependence on
the environment.
Today, there are seven
billion sapiens all
around the planet, while
animals do not even come
close to this number.
The progress of humankind
came at the price of
nature.
Ecosystems are
manipulated and at times
destroyed to fulfill the
wants and needs of
humans.
However, despite the
seemingly dire conditions
of the planet today,
humans cannot kill it, but
only change it.
The planet has existed for
billions of years.
When an asteroid killed
off dinosaurs, it led to
the survival of mammals.
Modern times saw drastic
modifications, humans are
no longer dependent on the
cycles of nature.
Instead, they go by
industrial time, which
sometimes makes them wake
up and sleep at unnatural
hours.
Other examples include
urbanization and the
decrease of the peasantry,
the emergence of the
industrial proleterate, the
disintegration of patriarchy,
and the rise of youth
culture.
One major upheaval is the
collapse of the family and
local community.
For the past two centuries,
the Industrial Revolution
provided the market new
powers and the state new
means of transportation and
communication.
It also gave the government
people like social workers,
policemen, teachers, and
clerks.
These factors gave the
government the ability to
take over the family and
community's role in keeping
the peace, making
decisions, and dictating
what the people should
follow.
International violence has
dropped as well.
After the collapse of
empires, the independent
states are no longer
interested in war.
Even among the Arabs, there
have been no massive wars
aside from the Gulf War.
In Africa, only a few
countries have invaded each
other.
This is explained by the
following factors.
The price of war rose
dramatically, using weapons
like nuclear bombs meant
collective suicide, and the
war profits declined
accordingly.
Today, wealth is composed of
human capital, socioeconomic
structures, and technical
knowledge, while peace became
lucrative.
Trading, rather than war, has
become more profitable.
Lastly, nowadays, the elite in
the world are mostly peace-loving,
unlike the rich in the past
ages.
Chapter 19.
And they lived happily ever
after.
The last five hundred years have
transformed the world into a
single historical and ecological
unit.
Humans as a whole now enjoy an
incredible amount of wealth and
potentially limitless energy.
Politics, social orders, daily
life, and ways of thinking have
transformed radically.
However, the author claims that we
are not really happy as a
species.
This is because happiness is
dependent not on external
factors, but on internal
factors.
Satisfaction with what is currently
present is more important than
getting more of what is wanted.
Expectations play a part, too, and
because people are exposed to
high standards, they may feel bad
about not being as beautiful, rich,
or smart as the media tells them
they should be.
Happiness is determined by a system
of neurons and biochemical, which
seem to be programmed to maintain
happiness levels to be fairly
constant.
Thus, even if good things are
happening, it can provide a brief
sensation of happiness, but it does
not make humans happier.
One result of our historical
development is that we now have in
our hands ways to alter our
biochemistry.
The study of the human mind made us
realize that we have the
psychological means of making
ourselves feel what we want to
feel.
A meaningful life can provide
satisfaction even during tough
conditions, while a meaningless life
is difficult regardless of how
comfortable the person is.
Thus, a person can choose his or her
own meaning, even if it can be
considered as a self-delusion.
Buddhism offers a way out of
delusion by giving the advice to
know oneself well, and to ignore both
feelings and external circumstances.
The author observes that so far, our
understanding of history failed to make
us learn what influences people's
happiness and suffering.
Chapter 20.
The End of Homo Sapiens
It is only until recent times that
sapiens were capable of breaking free
from biologically determined limits.
Although we have previously learned how
to go beyond these limitations through
selective breeding of animals, we now
know about life at the cellular and
nuclear levels, and because of this, we
could do so much more.
We could now design creatures according
to our tastes by manipulating stem
cells and genes.
Aside from genetic engineering, we are
now becoming better at cyborg engineering.
We are programming robots and using
robotic components to supplement our own
capabilities.
Devices like retina implants, biotic arms,
and other gadgets are replacing
defective biological parts, which makes
us wonder if we can make a complete
cyborg eventually.
It's also possible that we may create
an inorganic life that can undergo its
own evolution, turning us into a god of
sorts.
Despite breathtaking jumps in our evolution,
there may be some features that remain.
For example, the wealthy elite may create
further inequality through biological and
medical engineering, but we cannot predict
that yet.
There may come a point of the singularity when
all the meanings we ascribe to the world will
lose their relevance.
We could also be replaced by our very own
creations like rebellious Frankenstein.
The author leaves us with this haunting
quote, that we should not ask what we want
to become, but what do we want to want?
There is nothing more dangerous than being
dissatisfied and irresponsible gods who don't
know what they want.
Conclusion
Homo sapiens have a mind-boggling long history
before it, 13.5 billion years since the start of
everything, 3.8 billion since the emergence of
organisms on the planet, 2.5 billion years since the
evolution of homo humans, and 200,000 years since
homo sapiens first evolved in Africa.
It took a long time and tremendous
transformations to create us and the world we
have today.
The question is, do we still have time in the
future, especially now that we are becoming a
danger to ourselves?
Our collective accomplishments have liberated us
from our dependence on nature, which has shaped us over
millions of years.
We have become the dominant species on the planet,
and have harnessed virtually all natural resources from
the environment.
Also, we have learned to create new materials and
energy.
This could lead to future progress or our inevitable
destruction.
Perhaps looking back at everything that has happened
before our time will make us truly wiser.
Hopefully, we or our future generations will leave the
planet a better place than before.
Takeaways
Homo sapiens are just one species of humans which
evolved from the great apes.
Homo sapiens dominated over other human species because
of one crucial evolutionary advantage, a bigger and
smarter brain.
Our ability to communicate, transmit information, and
believe in myths or ideas not based on reality has led us to
be more cooperative with one another.
Our cooperation has led us to do more things that other humans and
animals were not able to do.
Many truths, we believe, are in fact myths, religion, money, human rights, laws, social
structures, and more.
But they are still important and they do hold societies together.
Wars and conflicts can be considered as incompatibilities in myths, and because money functions the
same for almost all cultures, it serves as a unifier among people.
The scientific revolution represents the time when Homo sapiens realized that we don't know
everything, but we can explore the unknown.
And finally, Homo sapiens can now destroy itself, but it can upgrade itself too.
Thus, it needs to be more responsible about its decisions.
