How to Consciously Design Your Ideal Future
Written by Benjamin P. Hardy
Performed by Philip Church
Introduction
This book
is a compilation of several articles I've
written and published at Thought Catalog.
The order of the content
has been rearranged, making the message
cohesive and comprehensive.
The purpose of this book is
to radically adjust your perspective of
yourself and life.
Not only will your worldview be challenged
in these pages, but also your daily
behaviors and the way you approach your goals.
I wrote these articles
between June and December of 2015.
This was not an easy
time of my life. Despite
my wife and I both being graduate students,
we had taken into our home three foster
children, ages 4, 6, and 8.
We love these kids
as our own, but the sheer challenge has
been humbling and crushing,
often bringing us to our knees
in search of answers.
I wondered if taking on such a responsibility
would get in the way of my dreams to become
a professional writer.
To my surprise, the responsibility
of caring for four people was a wake-up call.
I could no longer
wait for tomorrow to pursue my dreams.
I had to take advantage of the little time I had
while the kids were in school
today.
It may seem counterintuitive,
but consciously engineering
difficulty into your life
may be exactly what you need.
If you're not being challenged
and growing, chances are
you're stagnating and declining.
As momentum-based beings,
if we are in a state of decline,
all areas of our lives suffer.
To increase my own personal commitment
to my dreams,
in the fall of 2015,
I quit my university job
and made writing my full-time work.
This was my personal point of no return.
No longer would I spend my waking hours
completing other people's agendas.
When you make a decision,
the universe conspires to make it happen.
The act of jumping in with both feet
utterly exposed my nakedness.
I was forced to quickly improve,
to take risks,
and to become more
than I currently was.
You are never pre-qualified
to live your dreams.
You qualify yourself
by doing the work,
by committing,
even over-committing,
to what you believe you should do.
I wrote this book for myself,
and these pages are things
I'm trying to learn
so I can personally improve
my own life.
If what I've written
also helps and inspires you,
all the better.
I challenge you to look
beneath the words
to the underlying principles
and truths.
Behind every principle
is a promise.
Part 1
Organizing your life
to make happiness,
health,
and success automatic.
1.
Your life may be more
off course than you think.
Despite turbulence
and other conditions
keeping airplanes off course
90% of flight time,
most flights arrive
in the correct destination
at the intended time.
The reason for this phenomenon
is quite simple.
Through air traffic control
and the inertial guidance system,
pilots are constantly
course correcting.
When immediately addressed,
these course corrections
are not hard to manage.
When these course corrections
don't regularly happen,
catastrophe can result.
For example,
in 1979,
a passenger jet
with 257 people on board
left New Zealand
for a sightseeing flight
to Antarctica and back.
However,
the pilots were unaware
that someone had altered
the flight coordinates
by a measly 2 degrees,
putting them 28 miles east
of where they assumed to be.
Approaching Antarctica,
the pilots descended
to give the passengers
a view of the brilliant landscapes.
Sadly,
the incorrect coordinates
had placed them
directly in the path
of the active volcano
Mount Erebus.
The snow on the volcano
blended with the clouds above,
deceiving the pilots
into thinking
they were flying
above flat ground.
When the instruments
sounded a warning
of the quickly rising ground,
it was too late.
The plane crashed
into the volcano,
and everyone on board died.
An error of only
a few degrees
brought about
an enormous tragedy.
Small things,
if not corrected,
become big things,
always.
This flight
is an analogy
of our lives.
Even seemingly
inconsequential aspects
of our lives
can create ripples
and waves of consequence,
for better or worse.
How are you piloting
your life?
What feedback
are you receiving
to correct your course?
How often do you
check your guidance system?
Do you even
have a guidance system?
Where is your destination?
When are you
going to get there?
Are you currently
off course?
How long have you
been off course?
How would you know
if you are
on the right course?
How can you
minimize the turbulence
and other conditions
distracting your path?
Organizing your life
I don't think
I'm alone
in being slightly
scattered and sloppy
about certain areas
of my life.
Life is busy.
It's hard to keep
everything organized
and tidy.
And maybe you don't
want to have
an organized life.
But moving forward
will require
far less energy
if you remove
the excessive baggage
and tension.
Everything in your life
is energy.
If you're carrying
too much,
whether that's physical
or emotional,
your progress
will be hampered.
In his book
The Seven Habits
of Highly Effective People,
Stephen Covey explains
that some things
are important
and some things
are urgent.
Most people spend
their life
prioritizing urgent
and shallow activity,
e.g. answering emails,
putting out proverbial fires,
and just day-to-day stuff.
Very few people
have organized
their lives
to prioritize
almost exclusively
important and deep activity,
e.g. learning,
health,
relationships,
travel, and goals.
No one cares
about your success
more than you do.
If you're not
a meticulous accountant
about the important
details of your life,
then you aren't
responsible enough
to have what you say
you want.
So how do you
organize your life?
Environmental Energy
Is your living space
cluttered and messy
or simple and neat?
Do you keep stuff
like clothes
you no longer use?
If you have a car,
is it clean
or just another place
to keep your clutter
and garbage?
Does your environment
facilitate the emotions
you consistently
want to experience?
Does your environment
drain or improve
your energy?
Financial Energy
Do you have
unnecessary debt?
Do you know
how many dollars
you spend each month?
Do you know
how many dollars
you make each month?
Are you making
as much money
as you'd like to be?
What's holding you
back from creating
more value
in other people's lives?
Most people
don't track
their expenses.
But if they did,
they'd be shocked
how much money
they waste
on stuff like
eating out.
I'll be honest.
As a creative
and right-brained person,
administrative
and logistical details
bog me down.
I procrastinate
and avoid them.
But this lackluster
behavior is holding
me back
from the very goals
I'm trying
to accomplish.
Until I can hone
in on my finances,
I won't have
a healthier financial
life,
regardless of my income.
Until I take
complete responsibility
of my finances,
I'll always be
a slave to money.
And so will you.
Relational Energy
Are your relationships
the most meaningful
and enjoyable
part of your life?
Do you spend
enough time
nurturing the relationships
that really matter?
Do you maintain
toxic relationships
that no longer
serve you?
Are you authentic
and honest
in your relationships?
Like money,
most people's
relationships
are not organized
in a conscious
manner.
But with something
so critical,
we should take
better stock
of our relationships.
Health Energy
Do you eat
with the end in mind?
Are you conscious
of and in control
of the foods
you put in your body?
Does the food
you eat improve
or worsen
the other areas
of your life?
Does your body
reflect your highest ideals?
Is your body
as strong and fit
as you want it to be?
Are you healthier
now than you were
three months ago?
Health is wealth.
If you're bedridden,
who cares how organized
the other areas
of your life are?
It's so easy
to put our health
on the side,
like foregoing sleep,
over-consuming stimulants,
and making poor
eating habits.
But little things
become big things.
And eventually,
everything catches up.
Spiritual Energy
Do you have a sense
of purpose in life?
Have you come to terms
with life and death
in a way you resonate with?
How much power
do you have
in designing your future?
When you organize
your spiritual life,
you become clear
on what your life
is about.
You become clear
on what you stand for
and how you want
to spend each day.
You develop conviction
for what really matters
to you
and what is
a distraction.
No matter how well-defined,
everyone has a moral system
governing their behavior.
Most people believe
in being honest
and good people.
But until you organize
your spiritual life,
you'll experience
internal conflict
when acting contradictory
to your values
and vision.
Time
How much of your time
do you feel
in complete control of?
Is your time
being wasted
on things
you don't intrinsically enjoy?
Are the activities
you spend your time doing
moving you
toward your ideal future?
Are you spending
most of your time
furthering your own agenda
or someone else's?
What activities
should you remove
from your life?
How much time
do you waste each day?
What would your
ideal day look like?
What activities
could you outsource
or automate
that take up your time?
Until you organize
your time,
it will disappear
and move quickly.
Before you know it,
you'll wonder
where all the time went.
Once you organize
your time,
it will slow down.
You'll be able
to live more presently.
You'll be able
to experience time
as you want to.
You'll control
your time
rather than
the other way around.
Stop what you're doing
and get organized.
Getting organized
and conscious
of your present circumstances,
e.g. your environment,
finances,
relationships,
purpose,
and time
puts you in a position
to build toward
the future you want.
The fastest way
to move forward
in life
is not doing more.
It starts with
stopping the behaviors
holding you back.
If you want
to get in shape,
you'll make more progress
by stopping
your negative behaviors
than starting good ones.
So before you
start exercising,
purge the junk food
from your diet.
Until you stop
the damage,
you'll always be
taking one step forward
and one step backward.
Before you focus
on making more money,
reduce your spending.
Detach yourself
from needing more
and become content
with what you have.
Until you do this,
it doesn't matter
how much money you make.
You'll always spend
what you have
or more.
This is a matter
of stewardship.
Rather than wanting
more, more, more,
take proper care
of what you currently have.
Organize yourself.
Dial it in.
Your life is a garden.
What is good planting
if you don't prepare
the soil
and remove the weeds?
Why do most people
stay stuck?
They never organize.
They try adding more
or being more productive
or taking a different approach.
So before you hustle,
get organized.
Plan and invest
in your future.
The best time
to plant a tree
was 20 years ago.
The second best time
is now.
Chinese proverb.
Taking these
foundational areas
of life
and organizing them
is essential
to creating
your ideal future.
Very few people
consciously plan
and design their life.
It's actually startling
how few Americans
are investing
in their future.
But you have
complete power
over the details
of your life
the moment you decide
you're worthy
of that power.
That decision
is manifest
in tangible behaviors
like fixing
or removing
troubled relationships
and saying no
to activities
that are nothing more
than a waste
of your time.
You get to decide
right now.
If you fail to plan,
you are planning
to fail.
Benjamin Franklin.
Your vision
should be based
on your why,
not so much
your what.
Your why
is your reason.
Your what
is how that
is manifest.
And your what
can happen
in a ton
of different ways.
For example,
my why
is to help people
get clarity
on the life
they want to live
and to help them
achieve their goals
as quickly as possible.
My what
could be blogging,
parenting,
being a student,
going out to dinner,
and several other things.
Too many people
think creating a vision
is about nailing down
exactly what they want
in the next 20 years.
The problem
with this mega-long-term
approach to goal-setting
is that it actually
slows your potential.
Instead of having
a preset plan
of what he wants to do,
Tim Ferriss executes
on three- to six-month
experiments
that he's currently
excited about.
He told Darren Hardy
in an interview
that he has no clue
what the outcome
of his experiments
might be.
So there's no point
in making long-term plans.
He has no clue
what doors will open up,
and he wants to be
as open to the best
possibilities.
But his why
never changes.
Invest in your future
When you choose
to forego
momentary gratification
in order to have
an enhanced future,
you are investing
in your future.
Most people fail
to do this successfully.
Most people don't
purposefully invest
in their finances,
relationships,
health, and time.
But when you invest
in yourself
and in your future,
you ensure
your future-present
moments will continue
to get richer
and more enjoyable.
Thus your life
will continue
getting better
and more in line
with your ideal vision.
Track important metrics.
When performance
is measured,
performance improves.
When performance
is measured
and reported,
the rate of improvement
accelerates.
Thomas Monson
Getting organized
and investing
in your future
are futile
if you're not tracking.
In regards to
the most important
areas of your life,
you need to be on top
of what's going on.
Tracking is difficult.
If you've tried
it before,
chances are
you quit
within a few days.
Research has
repeatedly found
that when behavior
is tracked
and evaluated,
it improves
drastically.
If you're not
tracking the key
areas of your life,
then you're probably
more off course
than you think.
If you were to be
honest with yourself,
you'd be stunned
how out of control
things have become.
As J.M. Barrie,
author of Peter Pan,
has said,
the life of every man
is a diary in which
he means to write
one story and writes
another,
and his humblest hour
is when he compares
the volume as it is
with what he vowed
to make it.
The cool part is,
once you get organized,
make a plan,
and start tracking,
desired change
happens quickly.
The areas I'm
personally tracking
are my income
and expenses,
the amount of new
email subscribers
I get each month,
every minute of my life,
through a simple planner,
my key relationships,
daily progress
toward my few goals,
my weight,
muscle mass,
and body fat percentage
each month.
You can track
whatever priorities
you have,
but I can absolutely
promise you that
once you do,
your conscious awareness
of these things
will increase.
Your ability to control
these things
will enhance.
Your confidence
will wax strong,
and your life
will become
simpler.
You'll be living
a simple yet organized
and refined life.
You'll be responsible,
which, put another way,
is freedom.
Prayer and Meditation
to Reduce Noise
I have so much
to do today
that I'm going to
need to spend
three hours in prayer
in order to be able
to get it all done.
Martin Luther
There's a lot of emphasis
on hustle these days.
Hustle, hustle, hustle.
But all the hustle
in the wrong direction
isn't going to help you.
Yes, by hustling
you can fail often,
fail fast,
and fail forward.
However,
as Thomas Merton
has said,
people may spend
their whole lives
climbing the ladder
of success
only to find
once they reach the top
that the ladder
is leaning against
the wrong wall.
This happens
way too often.
We get caught
in the thick
of thin things.
Far too late
do we realize
that in our mad rush
we were pursuing
someone else's goals
instead of our own.
But spending
a large chunk
of time in prayer
and or meditation
does more than
provide clarity
to what you're doing.
These things
open up your mind
to possibilities
you can't get
while busy.
For example,
a few days ago
I spent the entire
morning praying,
thinking deeply,
listening to
inspirational music,
and writing
in my journal.
A few hours
into this process
an idea came to me
that is absolute gold.
I also got insights
regarding important
relationships
during that time,
which when those
insights came in
I immediately sent out
emails or texts
to those people.
Amazing collaborations
and mentorships
were the resultant
outcome.
But there's more.
Your thoughts
are incredibly powerful.
They actually govern
not only you
but those around you.
Think about it.
If you think positively
about the people
you're around
their lives are better.
This is why people
send positive energy
or pray for other people.
It actually makes
a difference.
Your thoughts
create endless ripples,
even waves,
of consequence
all around you.
While praying
and or meditating
for a large portion
of time,
the level of your
thoughts will elevate.
And interesting things
will begin happening.
If you're uncomfortable
with the idea
of miracles,
you can think of it
as luck.
Whatever you call it,
when you spend
large portions
of time every day
in deep reflection mode,
luck strikes.
Stuff happens
that is completely
outside of your control
for your benefit.
For instance,
during my deep dive
into my mind and soul,
one of my favorite authors
came across my blog.
He retweeted
one of my articles
and reached out to me.
If you're skeptical
of these ideas,
give it a try.
Why do you think
the majority
of the world's
most successful
have rituals
such as these?
There is a higher realm
you can tap into
that unlocks
limitless possibilities.
The only thing
holding you back
from those things
is your mind.
Move toward your goals
every single day.
How many days
go by
where you did nothing
to move toward
your big goals?
Probably too many.
Life is busy.
If you don't
purposefully carve time
out every day
to progress
and improve,
without question,
your time
will get lost
in the vacuum
of our increasingly
crowded lives.
Before you know it,
you'll be old
and withered,
wondering where
all that time went.
You pile up
enough tomorrows
and you'll find
you are left
with nothing
but a lot
of empty
yesterdays.
Harold Hill
After you've
gotten yourself
organized,
made plans,
started tracking,
and gotten into
the habit
of prayer meditation,
taking action
and hustling
will be automatic.
It's good practice
to do these kinds
of things
at the beginning
of your day
before your
willpower depletes.
If you don't,
it simply will
not get done.
By the end
of your day,
you'll be exhausted,
you'll be fried,
there will be
a million reasons
to just start tomorrow
and you will
start tomorrow,
which is never.
So your mantra
becomes,
the worst comes first.
Do that thing
you've been needing
to do,
then do it again
tomorrow.
If you take
just one step
toward your big goals
every day,
you'll realize
those goals
weren't really far away.
It's really easy
to get off course
in life.
Like airplanes,
we constantly need
to make course
corrections.
But we can ensure
we get where
we want in life
by organizing ourselves,
planning for our future,
tracking our progress,
heightening our mindset,
and hustling.
Do this long enough
and you'll be shocked.
Go!
Two.
Eight things
every person
should do
before 8 a.m.
Life is busy.
It can feel impossible
to move
toward your dreams.
If you have
a full-time job
and kids,
it's even harder.
How do you move forward?
If you don't
purposefully carve time
out of every day
to progress and improve,
without question,
your time will get
lost in the vacuum
of our increasingly
crowded lives.
Before you know it,
you'll be old
and withered,
wondering where
all that time went.
As Harold Hill said,
you pile up
enough tomorrows
and you'll find
you're left with
nothing but a lot
of empty yesterdays.
Rethinking Your Life
and Getting Out
of Survival Mode
This article
is intended
to challenge you
to rethink
your entire
approach to life.
The purpose
is to help you
simplify
and get back
to the fundamentals.
Sadly,
most people's lives
are filled to the brim
with the non-essential
and trivial.
They don't have time
to build toward
anything meaningful.
They are in
survival mode.
Are you in
survival mode?
Like Bilbo,
most of us
are like butter
scraped over
too much bread.
Unfortunately,
the bread is not
even our own,
but someone else's.
Very few have
taken the time
to take their lives
into their own hands.
It was social
and cultural
to live our lives
on other people's terms
just one generation ago.
And many millennials
are perpetuating
this process
simply because
it's the only worldview
we've been taught.
However,
there is a growing
collective consciousness
that with a lot
of work and intention,
you can live
every moment of your life
on your own terms.
You are the designer
of your destiny.
You are responsible.
You get to decide.
You must decide.
Because if you don't,
someone else will.
Indecision
is a bad decision.
With this short
morning routine,
your life will
quickly change.
It may seem like
a long list,
but in short,
it's really quite simple.
Wake up.
Get in the zone.
Get moving.
Put the right food
in your body.
Get ready.
Get inspired.
Get perspective.
Do something
to move you forward.
Let's begin.
1.
Get a healthy
7-plus hours of sleep.
Let's face it,
sleep is just as important
as eating
and drinking water.
Despite this,
millions of people
do not sleep enough
and experience
insane problems
as a result.
The National Sleep Foundation,
NSF,
conducted surveys
revealing that
at least 40 million Americans
suffer from more than
70 different sleep disorders.
Furthermore,
60% of adults
and 69% of children
experience one or more
sleep problems
a few nights or more
during a week.
In addition,
more than 40% of adults
experience daytime sleepiness
severe enough
to interfere
with their daily activities
at least a few days
each month.
With 20% reporting
problem sleepiness
a few days a week
or more.
On the flip side,
getting a healthy amount
of sleep is linked to
increased memory,
longer life,
decreased inflammation,
increased creativity,
increased attention
and focus,
decreased fat
and increased muscle mass
with exercise,
lower stress,
decreased dependence
on stimulants
like caffeine,
decreased risk
of getting into accidents,
decreased risk
of depression,
and tons more.
Google it.
The rest of this article
is worthless
if you don't make sleep
a priority.
Who cares if you wake up
at 5 a.m.
if you went to bed
three hours earlier?
You won't last long.
You may use stimulants
to compensate,
but that isn't sustainable.
In the long run,
your health will fall apart.
The goal needs to be
long-term sustainability.
2. Prayer and meditation
to facilitate clarity
and abundance.
After waking from a healthy
and restful sleep session,
prayer and meditation
are crucial for orienting
yourself toward the positive.
What you focus on expands.
Prayer and meditation
facilitate intense gratitude
for all that you have.
Gratitude is having
an abundance mindset.
When you think abundantly,
the world is your oyster.
There is limitless opportunity
and possibility for you.
People are magnets.
When you're grateful
for what you have,
you will attract more
of the positive and good.
Gratitude is contagious.
Gratitude may be
the most important key
to success.
It has been called
the mother of all virtues.
If you start every morning
putting yourself in a space
of gratitude and clarity,
you will attract the best
the world has to offer
and not get distracted.
3. Hard physical activity
Despite endless evidence
of the need for exercise,
only one-third of American
men and women
between the ages
of 25 to 64 years
engage in regular
physical activity
according to the
Center for Disease Control's
National Health
Interview Survey.
If you want to be
among the healthy,
happy, and productive
people in the world,
get in the habit
of regular exercise.
Many people go
immediately to the gym
to get their body moving.
I have lately found
that doing yard work
in the wee hours
of the morning
generates an intense
inflow of inspiration
and clarity.
Whatever your preference,
get your body moving.
Exercise has been found
to decrease your chance
of depression,
anxiety, and stress.
It is also related
to higher success
in your career.
If you don't care
about your body,
every other aspect
of your life
will suffer.
Humans are holistic beings.
4. Consume 30 grams
of protein
Donald Lehman,
professor emeritus
of nutrition
at the University of Illinois,
recommends consuming
at least 30 grams
of protein for breakfast.
Similarly,
Tim Ferriss,
in his book
The 4-Hour Body,
also recommends
30 grams of protein
30 minutes after waking.
According to Mr. Ferriss,
his father did this
and lost 19 pounds
in one month.
Protein-rich foods
keep you full longer
than other foods
because they take longer
to leave the stomach.
Also, protein keeps
blood sugar levels steady,
which prevents spikes
in hunger.
Eating protein first
decreases your white
carbohydrate cravings,
which are the types
of carbs that get you fat.
Think bagels,
toast, and donuts.
Mr. Ferriss makes
four recommendations
for getting adequate protein
in the morning.
Eat at least 40%
of your breakfast calories
as protein.
Do it with two or three
whole eggs.
Each egg has about
six grams of protein.
If you don't like eggs,
use something like
turkey bacon,
organic pork bacon,
or sausage,
or cottage cheese.
Or you could always
do a protein shake
with water.
5. Take a cold shower.
Tony Robbins starts
every morning
by jumping into
a 57-degree Fahrenheit
swimming pool.
Why would he do
such a thing?
Cold water immersion
radically facilitates
physical and mental wellness.
When practiced regularly,
it provides long-lasting
changes to your body's
immune, lymphatic,
circulatory,
and digestive systems
that improve
the quality of your life.
It can also increase
weight loss
because it boosts
your metabolism.
A 2007 research study
found that taking
cold showers routinely
can help treat
symptoms of depression
often more effectively
than prescription medications.
That's because
cold water triggers
a wave of mood-boosting
neurochemicals
which make you feel happy.
There is, of course,
an initial fear
of stepping into
a cold shower.
Without a doubt,
if you've tried this before,
you've found yourself
standing outside the shower
dreading the thought
of going in.
You may have even
talked yourself out of it
and said,
maybe tomorrow,
and turned the hot water
handle before getting in.
Or maybe you jumped in
but quickly turned
the hot water on.
What has helped me
is thinking about it
like a swimming pool.
It's a slow, painful death
to get into a cold pool
slowly.
You just need to jump in.
After 20 seconds,
you're fine.
It's the same way
with taking a cold shower.
You get in,
your heart starts beating
like crazy.
Then, after 20 seconds,
you feel fine.
To me,
it increases my willpower
and boosts my creativity
and inspiration.
While standing with the cold water
hitting my back,
I practice slowing my breath
and calm down.
After I've chilled out,
I feel super happy
and inspired.
Lots of ideas start flowing
and I become motivated
to achieve my goals.
6.
Listen to,
read,
uplifting content.
Ordinary people
seek entertainment.
Extraordinary people
seek education
and learning.
It is common
for the world's
most successful people
to read at least
one book per week.
They are constantly learning.
I can easily get through
one audiobook per week
by just listening
during my commute to school
and while walking on campus.
Taking even 15 to 30 minutes
every morning
to read uplifting
and instructive information
changes you.
It puts you in the zone
to perform at your highest.
Over a long enough period of time,
you will have read
hundreds of books.
You'll be knowledgeable
on several topics.
You'll think and see
the world differently.
You'll be able to make
more connections
between different topics.
7.
Review your life vision.
Your goals should be written down,
short-term and long-term.
Taking just a few minutes
to read your life vision
puts your day
into perspective.
If you read your
long-term goals every day,
you will think about them
every day.
If you think about them
every day
and spend your days
working toward them,
they'll manifest.
Achieving goals
is a science.
There's no confusion
or ambiguity to it.
If you follow
a simple pattern,
you can accomplish
all of your goals,
no matter how big they are.
A fundamental aspect
of that is writing them down
and reviewing them
every single day.
8.
Do at least one thing
toward long-term goals.
Willpower is like a muscle
that depletes
when it is exercised.
Similarly,
our ability to make
high-quality decisions
becomes fatigued over time.
The more decisions you make,
the lower quality they become,
the weaker your willpower.
Consequently,
you need to do the hard stuff
first thing in the morning,
the important stuff.
If you don't,
it simply will not get done.
By the end of your day,
you'll be exhausted.
You'll be fried.
There will be a million reasons
to just start tomorrow.
And you will start tomorrow,
which is never.
So your mantra becomes,
the worst comes first.
Do that thing you've been
needing to do.
Then do it again tomorrow.
If you take just one step
toward your big goals
every day,
you'll realize those goals
weren't really far away.
Conclusion
After you've done this,
no matter what you have
for the rest of your day,
you'll have done
the important stuff first.
You'll have put yourself
in a place to succeed.
You'll have inched
toward your dreams.
Because you'll have done
all these things,
you'll show up better in life.
You'll be better at your job.
You'll be better
in your relationships.
You'll be happier.
You'll be more confident.
You'll be more bold
and daring.
You'll have more clarity
and vision.
Your life will shortly change.
You can't have mornings
like this consistently
without waking up
to all that is incongruent
in your life.
Those things you despise
will meet their demise.
They'll disappear
and never return.
You'll quickly find
you're doing the work
you're passionate about.
Your relationships
will be passionate,
meaningful,
deep,
and fun.
You will have freedom
and abundance.
The world and the universe
will respond to you
in beautiful ways.
3.
Humans are holistic systems.
Your physical health
affects everything.
Human beings are holistic.
When you change a part
of any system,
you simultaneously
change the whole.
You can't change a part
without fundamentally
changing everything.
Every pebble of thought,
no matter how inconsequential,
creates endless ripples
of consequence.
This idea,
coined the butterfly effect
by Edward Lorenz,
came from the metaphorical
example of a hurricane
being influenced
by minor signals,
such as the flapping
of the wings
of a distant butterfly
several weeks earlier.
Little things
become big things.
When one area
of your life
is out of alignment,
every area
of your life suffers.
You can't compartmentalize
a working system.
Although it's easy
to push certain areas,
like your health
and relationships,
to the side,
you unwittingly infect
your whole life.
Eventually and always,
the essentials
you procrastinate
or avoid
will catch up
to your detriment.
Conversely,
when you improve
one area of your life,
all other areas
are positively influenced.
As James Allen wrote
in As a Man Thinketh,
when a man makes
his thoughts pure,
he no longer desires
impure food,
we are holistic systems.
Humanity as a whole
is the same way.
Everything you do
affects the whole world
for better or worse.
So I invite you to ask,
am I part of the cure
or am I part of the disease?
Coldplay
Stop consuming caffeine.
Although people think
they perform better
on caffeine,
the truth is
they really don't.
Actually,
we've become so dependent
on caffeine
that we use it
to simply get back
to our status quo.
When we're off it,
we underperform
and become incapable.
Isn't this absurd?
With healthy eating,
sleeping,
and exercise,
your body will naturally
produce far more
and better energy
than caffeine
could ever provide.
Give it up
and see what happens.
You will probably get
withdrawal headaches,
but after a few days,
you'll feel amazing.
Stop consuming refined sugar.
If you stop consuming sugar,
your brain will radically change.
Actually,
study after study
is showing that
refined sugar
is worse for our brains
than it is for our waistlines.
According to Dr. William Cota Martin,
refined sugar
is nothing more than poison
because it has been depleted
of its life forces,
vitamins,
and minerals.
Refined sugar
has now been shown
to make us cranky,
make us make rash decisions,
and make us stupid.
Again,
like caffeine,
if you stop eating
refined sugar,
you will experience
some negative withdrawals.
But like any good habit,
the effects of this
will be seen
in the long run.
What would your health
be like a year from now
or five
if you were completely
refined sugar-free?
Fast from all food
and caloric beverages
24 hours
once per week.
One day,
24-hour,
food fasts
are a popular way
to maintain health and vigor.
Fasting leverages
the self-healing properties
of the human body.
Radical health improvements
occur when the digestive system
is given rest
and the organs
get ample time to repair
and heal themselves.
A regular practice
of fasting
can improve
digestive efficiency,
increase mental clarity,
increase physical
and mental vigor,
remove toxins,
improve vision,
give a general feeling
of well-being.
Like all the other habits,
fasting gets easier
with practice.
I've been fasting
for years
and it's one of the best things
I have done for my health.
Fasting is also
one of the most
recognized techniques
in religious
and spiritual practices.
I also use fasting
to get spiritual clarity
and refinement.
Honestly,
I could go on for hours
about this one.
Give it a try.
You'll never be the same.
Consume a tablespoon
of coconut oil
once per day.
Coconut oil
is one of the healthiest foods
on the planet.
Here are seven reasons
you should eat coconut oil
every single day.
It boosts HDL,
good cholesterol,
and simultaneously
blocks LDL,
bad cholesterol buildup.
It has special fats
that help you burn
more fat,
have more energy,
and maintain healthy weight.
It fights aging
and keeps you looking
and feeling young.
It reduces fever
and acts as an anti-inflammatory.
It is antibacterial
and thus wards off
possible illnesses.
It improves memory
and cognitive functioning,
even for people
with Alzheimer's.
It can boost testosterone
for men
and balance healthy hormones
level for both men
and women.
Coconut oil
is a healthy alternative
to caffeine.
Eating a small amount
will give you a shot
of energy
without the side effects.
Buy a juicer
and juice a few times
per week.
Juicing is an incredible way
to get loads of vitamins
and nutrients
from fruits and vegetables.
These nutrients can
help protect against
cardiovascular disease,
cancer,
and various inflammatory diseases,
guard against
oxidative cellular damage
from everyday cellular maintenance
and exposure
to chemicals and pollution.
There are several approaches
you can take to juicing.
You can reset your body
by doing a 3-10 day juice cleanse,
or you could simply
incorporate juice
into your regular diet.
I do both from time to time.
I always feel enormously
better after juicing,
especially when I get
lots of intense greens
like kale into my system.
Drink 64 to 100 ounces
of water per day.
Human beings
are mostly water.
As we drink
healthy amounts of water,
we have smaller waistlines,
healthier skin,
and better functioning brains.
Actually,
as we drink enough water,
it's safe to say
we're better in every way.
It's a no-brainer.
If you're not drinking
the healthy amount
of water each day,
you should critically assess
your priorities in life.
Floss your teeth.
About 50% of Americans
claim to floss daily.
My guess is
that's a large overestimate.
Either way,
the benefits of flossing
are incredible.
Doing so daily
prevents gum disease
and tooth loss.
Everyone gets plaque,
and it can only be removed
by flossing
or a deep cleaning
from your dentist.
Plaque buildup
can lead to cavities,
tooth decay,
and gum disease.
If left untreated,
gum disease can be
a risk factor
for heart disease,
diabetes,
and a high body mass index.
Yes,
not flossing
can make you fat.
Not only that,
but it greatly
reduces bad breath.

Ordinary people
seek entertainment.
Extraordinary people
seek education.
Ordinary people
seek entertainment.
Extraordinary people
seek education
and learning.
It is common
for the world's
most successful people
to read at least
one book per week.
They are constantly learning.
I can easily get through
one audiobook per week
by just listening
during my commute to school
and while walking on campus.
Taking even 15 to 30 minutes
every morning
to read uplifting
and instructive information
changes you.
It puts you in the zone
to perform at your highest.
Over a long enough period of time,
you will have read
hundreds of books.
You'll be knowledgeable
on several topics.
You'll think
and see the world differently.
You'll be able to make
more connections
between different topics.
True learning is difficult
and is more than
acquiring knowledge.
There is a difference
between knowing
and understanding.
You don't truly know
something until you've
experienced it,
until you can
explain it simply
and do it.
I could read every book
about building a computer,
but until I've actually
built a computer,
I don't really know.
Theory and lived experience
are two completely
different things.
So don't let your only
learning be that
from books.
Apply what you learn
from books
by actually doing stuff.
Make mistakes.
Have experiences.
Listen to audiobooks
on two times speed
while taking notes
in a journal
for 30 to 60 minutes
per day.
Generally,
I'd recommend reading
for 30 to 60 minutes
per day,
but lately,
I've been listening
to audiobooks
or podcasts
on my iPod
at two times speed
while taking notes
in a journal.
When you first try
listening at two times,
it's a little weird,
but you get used to it.
Then listening at normal
speed feels like
slow motion.
Neurologically,
when you listen
to something,
a different part
of your brain
is engaged
than when you
write it down.
Memory recorded
by listening
does not discriminate
important from
non-important information.
However,
writing creates
spatial regions
between important
and non-important
pieces of information,
allowing your memory
to target and ingrain
the important stuff
you want to remember.
Furthermore,
research has shown
the simple act
of writing something down
increases brain development
and memory.
It's becoming regular
for me to have
15 to 30 pages
of notes in my journal
every morning
during my 60 minutes
of audiobook listening.
Marry your best friend.
For all the productivity
and success advice
I've read,
shaped and marketed
for dozens of authors
in the last decade,
I've never really seen
someone come out
and say,
find yourself a spouse
who compliments
and supports you
and makes you better.
Ryan Holiday
Research done by economists
have found,
even after controlling
for age,
education,
and other demographics,
that married people
make 10 to 50% more
than single people.
Why would this be?
Being married
gives you a higher purpose
for being productive.
You're no longer
a lone ranger,
but have another person
who relies on you.
Marriage also smacks you
in the face
with what's really
important in life.
Sure,
hanging out
and partying
are fun,
but too many people
get stuck in this phase
and miss the meaning
that comes from
building a life
with someone.
You will never find
a better personal
development seminar
or book
than marriage.
It will highlight
all of your flaws
and weaknesses,
challenging you
to become a better person
than you ever
thought possible.
Stop consuming the news
or reading the newspaper.
Although the amount
of warfare and deaths
by human hands
are reducing globally,
you will not get
that message
watching televised news
or reading the newspaper.
On the contrary,
these media outlets
have an agenda.
Their goal is to appeal
to your fears
by inflating extreme cases,
making them seem normal
and commonplace.
If they didn't do so,
their viewership
would plummet,
which is why
Peter Diamandis,
one of the world's experts
on entrepreneurship
and the future
of innovation,
has said,
I've stopped watching TV news.
They couldn't pay me
enough money.
You can get
high-quality news
curated from Google News.
When you detox
from the toxic filth
that is public news,
you'll be startled
as your worldview
becomes radically
more optimistic.
There is no
objective reality.
Instead,
we live in perceived realities
and are thus responsible
for the worldview
we adopt.
5.
Expanding your time
You can't have it all.
Every decision
has opportunity cost.
When you choose
one thing,
you simultaneously
don't choose
several others.
When someone says
you can have it all,
they are lying.
They are almost certainly
not practicing
what they preach
and are trying to sell
you on something.
The truth is,
you don't want it all.
And even if you did,
reality simply
doesn't work that way.
For example,
I've come to terms
with the fact that
I want my family
to be the center
of my life.
Spending time
with my wife
and three foster kids
is my top priority.
As a result,
I can't spend
12 or 15 hours a day
working like some people
and that's okay.
I've made my choice.
And that's the point.
We all need to choose
what matters most to us
and own that.
If we attempt
to be everything,
we'll end up being nothing.
Internal conflict
is hell.
Although the traditional
view of creativity
is that it is unstructured
and doesn't follow rules,
creativity usually occurs
by thinking inside
the proverbial box,
not outside of it.
People flex
their creative muscles
when they constrain
their options
rather than broaden them.
Hence,
the more clearly defined
and constraining
your life's objectives,
the better.
Because it allows you
to sever everything
outside those objectives.
Almost everything
in life is a distraction.
You cannot overestimate
the unimportance
of practically everything.
Greg McEwen
Almost everything
is a distraction
from what really matters.
You really can't put
a price tag on certain things.
They are beyond
a particular value to you.
You'd give up everything,
even your life,
for those things.
Your relationships
and personal values
don't have a price tag,
and you should never
exchange something
priceless for a price.
Keeping things
in proper perspective
allows you to remove
everything non-essential
from your life.
It allows you to live
simply and laser-focused,
and to avoid
dead-end roads
leading nowhere.
Five minutes
is a lot of time.
When you have
five minutes of downtime,
how do you spend
that time?
Most people use it
as an excuse
to rest or laze.
By lazing for
five-minute breaks
each day,
we waste
25 minutes daily.
That's 9,125
minutes per year,
25 times 365.
Sadly,
my guess is
we're wasting
far more time
than that.
I was once told
by my 9th-grade
English teacher
that if I read
every time I had
a break,
even if the break
was just for a minute
or two,
that I'd get a lot
more reading done
than expected.
She was right.
Every time I finished
my work early
or had a spare moment,
I'd pick up a book
and read.
How we spend
our periodic
five-minute breaks
is a determining factor
to what we achieve
in our lives.
Every little bit
adds up.
Why can we justify
wasting so much time?
Yesterday is more
important than today.
The best time
to plant a tree
was 20 years ago.
The second best time
is now.
Chinese proverb.
Our present circumstances
are a reflection
of our past decisions.
Although we have
enormous power
to change the trajectory
of our lives
here and now,
we are where we are
because of our past.
While it's popular
to say the past
doesn't matter,
that simply is not true.
Today is tomorrow's
yesterday.
What we do today
will either enhance
or diminish
our future-present moments.
But most people
put things off
until tomorrow.
We thoughtlessly
go into debt,
forego exercise
and education,
and justify
negative relationships.
But at some point
it all catches up.
Like an airplane
off course,
the longer we wait
to correct,
the longer and harder
it is to get back
on course.
Time is absolutely
marvelous.
We get to anticipate
the experiences
we want to have,
which is often
more enjoyable
than the experiences
themselves.
We get to have
the experiences
we long for.
And then we get
to remember
and carry those
experiences with us
forever.
The past,
present,
and future
are uniquely
important and
enjoyable.
Go to bed early
and rise early.
According to
countless research
studies,
people who go to
bed and rise
early are better
students.
Harvard biologist
Christoph Rondler
found that early
sleep risers
are more proactive
and are more
likely to anticipate
problems and minimize
them efficiently,
which leads to being
more successful
in the business.
Other benefits
of going to bed
and rising early,
backed by research,
include
being a better
planner,
being holistically
healthier as
individuals,
getting better
sleep,
more optimistic,
satisfied,
and conscientious.
Waking up early
allows you to
proactively and
consciously design
your day.
You can start
with a morning
routine that sets
the tone for
your whole day.
You show self-respect
by putting yourself
first.
In your morning
routine,
you can pray,
meditate,
exercise,
listen to or read
inspiring content,
and write in your
journal.
This routine
will give you
a much stronger
buzz than a
cup of coffee.
Decide where
you'll be in
five years
and get there
in two.
How can you
achieve your
ten-year plan
in the next
six months?
Peter Thiel
There is always
a faster way
than you
originally conceive.
Actually,
goal-setting
can slow your
progress and
diminish your
potential if
you rely too
heavily upon it.
In an interview
with Success
Magazine,
Tim Ferriss said
that he doesn't
have five or
ten-year goals.
Instead,
he works on
experiments or
projects for a
six-to-twelve-week
period of time.
If they do
extremely well,
the possible
doors that
could open
are endless.
Tim would
rather play to
the best
possibilities than
get stuck on
one track.
He says this
approach allows
him to go
drastically farther
than he could
ever plan for.
Have no more
than three items
on your to-do
list each day.
When you
shift your life
from day-to-day
reactivity to
one of creation
and purpose,
your goals
become a lot
bigger.
Consequently,
your priority
list becomes
smaller.
Instead of
doing a million
things poorly,
the goal
becomes to do
a few things
incredibly,
or better yet,
to do one
thing better
than anyone
else in the
world.
If you have
more than
three priorities,
then you
don't have
any.
Jim Collins
So instead
of trying to
do a million
small things,
what one or
two things
would make
the biggest
impact?
Dan Sullivan,
founder of
Strategic Coach,
explains that
there are two
economies,
the economy
of hard work
and the economy
of results.
Some people
think hard work
is the recipe.
Others think
about the most
efficient way
to get a
desired result.
Tim Ferriss,
in his book
The 4-Hour Body,
explains what he
calls minimum
effective dose,
MED,
which is simply
the smallest dose
that will yield
a desired result
and anything past
the MED
is wasteful.
Water boils
at 100 degrees
Celsius
at standard
air pressure.
It is not
more boiled
if you add
more heat.
What is the
fastest way
to get
your desired
outcome?
Fast from the
Internet
24 hours
once per week.
Your body
gets an
intervention
when you fast.
Your mind
and relationships
could use one
too.
Unplug yourself
from the matrix.
If you haven't
caught on already,
human beings
are highly
addictive creatures.
We love our
coffee,
sugar,
and internet.
And these
things are all
great,
but our lives
can be far
more enhanced
by using
these tools
in wisdom.
The purpose
of the
Internet Fast
is to reconnect
to yourself
and your loved
ones.
So you probably
shouldn't do it
the same day
you do your
food fast,
because eating
is one of the
strongest ways
to form bonds.
You'll be
blown away
by how much
more connected
you feel to
your loved ones
when you can
give them
your undivided
attention.
It may even
feel awkward
for a while
having a
real-life
conversation
without looking
at your
phone
every three
minutes.
Say no
to people,
obligations,
requests,
and opportunities
you're not
interested in
from now on.
No more yes.
It's either
hell yeah
or no.
Derek Sivers
You're 20
seconds of
daily courage
will most
consistently
involve
saying no
to stuff
that doesn't
really matter.
But how
could you
possibly say
no to
certain
opportunities
if you
don't know
what you
want?
You can't.
Like most
people,
you'll be
seduced by
the best
thing that
comes around,
or you'll
crumble under
other people's
agendas.
But if you
know what
you want,
you'll have
the courage
and foresight
to pass up
even brilliant
opportunities,
because ultimately,
they are
distractors from
your vision.
As Jim Collins
said in
Good to Great,
a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity is
irrelevant if it
is the wrong
opportunity.
Give at least
one guilt-free
hour of
relaxation per
day.
In our quest
for success,
many of us
have become
workaholics.
However,
relaxation is
crucial for
success.
It is akin to
resting between
sets at the
gym.
Without resting,
your workout
will be far
less than it
could have
been.
Foolishly,
people approach
their line
times like a
workout without
rest breaks.
Instead,
they take
stimulants to
keep themselves
going longer
and longer.
But this isn't
sustainable or
healthy.
It's also bad
for productivity
and creativity
in the short
and long run.
Check your
email and
social media
at least 60
to 90 minutes
after you
wake up.
Most people
check their
email and
social media
immediately upon
waking up.
This puts
them in a
reactive state
for the remainder
of the day.
Instead of
living life on
their own terms,
they'd rather
respond to
other people's
agendas.
Hence the
importance of
having a solid
morning routine.
When you wake
up and put
yourself,
not other people
first,
you position
yourself to
win before
you ever
begin playing.
Private victory
always precedes
public victory.
Stephen Covey
Make the first
few hours of
your morning
about you
so that you
can be the
best you
can for
other people.
My morning
routine consists
of prayer,
journal writing,
listening to
audiobooks and
podcasts while
I work out,
and taking a
cold shower.
After I've
had an epic
morning and
I'm clear on
the direction
of my day,
I can utilize
email and
social media
for my benefit
rather than
detriment.
Make a few
radical changes
to your life
each year.
Reinvent
yourself every
year.
Novelty is
an antidote
to monotony.
Jump into
new pursuits
and relationships.
Try things
you've never
done before.
Take risks.
Have more
fun.
Pursue big
things you've
been procrastinating
for years.
In the past
year, my wife
and I went
from having
no kids to
having three
foster kids
ages four,
six, and
eight.
I've started
blogging.
I quit my
job and started
writing full-time.
I completely
changed my
diet.
I've changed
my entire
daily routine.
Without question,
this year has
been the most
transformative
year of my
life.
It's taught me
that you can
change your
whole life
in one year.
I plan on
changing my
whole life
for the better
every year.
Spend five
minutes creating
outlines in
advance.
This will
save you
hours.
In his
book,
Essentialism,
Greg McKeown
explains a
method he
uses to save
time and
enhance creativity.
Hours or
even days
before jumping
into a
creative activity,
he spends
just three
to four
minutes creating
an outline.
Once the
outline is
built, he
walks away
from it.
When he
starts into
his project,
the outline
triggers a
flood of
information
getting him
quickly into
the zone,
rather than
having to
mentally generate
all the
information he
needs from
scratch.
I, too,
use this
method in
my writing.
I design
writing sessions
for the sole
purpose of
creating outlines.
With a pile of
outlines already
structured, I
can often return
and write
several articles
in a single
session.
Without the
outlines, I
can often lose
motivation and
focus after just
one.
I've even used
this approach in
outlining the
contents of
entire books.
I take a blank
sheet of paper and
write all the
chapters that would
be in a book.
With that framework
in place, I can
brain dump and get
a solid first draft
in no time.
Focus is today's
IQ.
We live in the
most distracted
era of human
history.
The Internet is a
double-edged sword.
Like money, the
Internet is neutral.
And it can be used
for good or bad
based on who
uses it.
Sadly, most of us
are simply not
responsible enough
for the Internet.
We waste hours
every day staring
idly at a screen.
Millennials are
particularly prone
to distractions on
the Internet.
but nowadays,
everyone is
susceptible.
Our attention
spans have shrunk
to almost nothing.
Our willpower
has atrophied.
We've developed
some really bad
habits that often
require extreme
interventions to
reverse.
There's a growing
body of scientific
evidence suggesting
the Internet,
with its constant
distractions and
interruptions, is
turning us into
scattered and
superficial thinkers.
One of the
biggest challenges
to constant
distraction is that
it leads to
shallow, rather
than deep
thinking.
And shallow
thinking leads
to shallow
living.
The Roman
philosopher Seneca
may have put it
best 2,000 years
ago.
To be everywhere
is to be nowhere.
In his book
Deep Work,
Rules for Focused
Success in a
Distracted World,
Cal Newport
differentiates deep
work from shallow
work.
Deep work is
using your skills
to create something
of value.
It takes thought,
energy, time,
and concentration.
Shallow work is
all the little
administrative and
logistical stuff.
Email, meetings,
calls, expense
reports, etc.
Most people aren't
moving toward their
goals because they
prioritize shallow
work.
The ability to
perform deep work
is becoming
increasingly rare
at exactly the
same time it is
becoming increasingly
valuable in our
economy.
As a consequence,
the few who
cultivate this skill
and then make it
the core of their
working life will
thrive.
Cal Newport

No other success
can compensate for
failed relationships.
Do something kind
for someone else
daily.
Have I done any
good in the world
today?
Have I helped
anyone in need?
Have I cheered up
the sad and made
someone feel glad?
If not, I have
failed indeed.
Has anyone's
burden been lighter
today because I was
willing to share?
Have the sick and
the weary been
helped on their
way?
When they needed
my help, was I
there?
Will L. Thompson,
Music and Text.
If we're too busy
to help other
people, we've
missed the mark.
Taking the time
to spontaneously,
as well as planned,
helping other
people is one of
the greatest joys
in life.
Helping others
opens you up to
new sides of
yourself.
It helps you
connect deeper
with those you
help and humanity
in general.
It clarifies what
really matters in
life.
As Thomas
Monson has
said,
never let a
problem to be
solved become
more important
than a person
to be loved.
That would
truly be a
failure.
Say thank you
every time you're
served by someone.
It's amazing when
you meet someone
who is expressively
and genuinely
grateful.
It's amazing
because frankly,
it's rare.
I remember one
day while working
as a busser of
a restaurant as a
teenager.
Every time I
went by a certain
table, whether I
was refilling waters,
bringing food,
anything, the
kid at the
table, no more
than 20 years
old, graciously
said, thank you.
I even heard him
from close proximity
saying it to all the
other employees when
they stopped by his
table.
This experience had a
dramatic impact on
me.
It was so simple what
he was doing, yet so
beautiful.
I instantly loved this
person and wanted to
serve him even more.
I could tell by how he
looked in my eyes when
saying thank you that
he meant it.
It came from a place
of gratitude and
humility.
Interestingly, one
study has found that
saying thank you
facilitated a 66%
increase in help
offered by those
serving.
Although altruism is
the goal, don't be
surprised as your
habit of graciously
saying thank you
turns into even more
to be thankful for.
Say I love you three
plus times a day to
the most important
people in your life.
According to
neuroscience research,
the more you express
love, like gratitude,
the more other people
feel love for you.
Sadly, people are
taught absurd mindsets
about being vulnerable
and loving in
relationships.
Just this morning,
my wife and I had to
coax and prod our
three foster kids to
say one nice thing
about each other and
to say they loved each
other.
It took several
minutes for our
eight-year-old foster
boy to muster the
strength to say he
loved his sister.
Yet all of our kids
constantly berate and
belittle each other.
You know the feeling
when you want to say
I love you but hold
back.
What a horrible feeling.
Why do we hesitate
to express our love?
Why do we hesitate
to connect deeply
with others?
This may be strange,
but if you tell your
friends and family you
love them, they'll be
blown away.
I once knew a
Polynesian missionary
who told everyone he
loved them.
It was clear he was
sincere.
I asked him why he
did it.
What he told me changed
my life.
When I tell people I
love them, it not only
changes them, but it
changes me.
Simply by saying the
words, I feel more
love for that person.
I've been telling people
all around me I love
them.
They feel treasured
by me.
Those who know me have
come to expect it.
When I forget to say it,
they miss it.
The bitterest tears
shed over graves are
for words left unsaid
and deeds left undone.
Harriet Beecher Stowe
Genuinely apologize
to people you've
mistreated.
People make mistakes
several times every
single day.
Sadly and hilariously,
much of the time we
act like kids and blame
our mistakes on
external factors.
Research has found
that people who don't
openly and often
apologize experience
higher levels of
stress and anxiety.
You don't need that
pent-up energy in your
life.
Make amends and let
it go.
It's not your choice
if people choose to
forgive you.
Make friends with
five people who
inspire you.
You are the average
of the five people
you spend the most
time with.
Jim Rohn
Who you spend time
with is incredibly
important.
Even more fundamental
is what types of
people are you
comfortable around.
your comfort level
is one of the
clearest indicators
of your character.
Are the people you
enjoy being around
inspiring or degrading,
hardworking,
or lazy?
What kinds of
beliefs do your
friends have?
What kinds of goals
are they pursuing?
How much money
do they make?
What does their
health look like?
All of these things
dramatically impact you,
and it is one of the
most painful experiences
in the world to
become uncomfortable
around people who
have long been your
friends?
When you grow and
evolve and long for
more, you'll begin
seeking a different
crowd to surround
yourself with.
Misery loves company.
Don't let them hold
you back.
Move on, but never
detach from the love
you have for those
people.
Be spontaneously
generous with a
stranger at least
once per month.
Life isn't all about
what you can achieve
or acquire.
It's more about who
you become and what
you contribute.
Interestingly, research
done at Yale has
found that people
are instinctively
cooperative and
generous.
However, if you
stall and think
about being helpful
or generous, you're
less likely to do
it.
And the longer you
wait, the likelihood
of you being helpful
diminishes.
So be spontaneous.
When you get the
wild thought of
buying the person's
food in the car
behind you, just
do it.
Don't think about
it.
If you're driving
down the road and
see someone with
car trouble off to
the side, just do
it.
Don't think about
it.
When you want to
say I love you to
a loved one, just
do it.
Don't think about
it.
Paralysis by
analysis is dumb.
And Malcolm
Gladwell explains
in Blink that
snap decisions are
often far better
than well-thought-out
ones.
Write and place a
short, thoughtful
note for someone
once per day.
The messages of
handwritten letters
impact deeper and
are remembered longer
than electronic
messages.
There is no
comparison to this
traditional form of
conversation.
Handwritten messages
are so powerful that
people often keep
these notes for a
long time, sometimes
a lifetime.
Jack Canfield has
taught that writing
three to five
handwritten notes per
day will change your
relationships.
In our email world, it
can seem inefficient to
handwrite and mail a
letter, but relationships
aren't about efficiency.
Not only will
handwriting letters
change your
relationships, it will
change you.
Research has shown that
writing by hand
increases brain
development and
cognition more than
typing can.
Consequently, the
things you write will
be seared into your
own memory as well,
allowing both you and
the recipient to
reflect back on
cherished moments.
Writing handwritten
notes spices up your
relationships, adding
an element of fun.
It's exciting placing
kind and loving notes
in random places for
your loved ones to
find.
Put a note under the
windshield wipers of
your loved one's car to
find after a hard day's
work.
Hidden, wait till
they come out and
watch them from across
the street.
You'll see their eyes
light up and smile
spread.
Other fun places
include in the fridge,
in the closet, on the
computer keyboard, in
their shoe, in their
wallet, the mailbox,
anywhere that makes the
experience a surprise.
Become good friends
with your parents.
Many people have
horrible relationships
with their parents.
I once did myself.
Growing up can be
tough and sometimes our
parents make horrible
decisions that negatively
impact us.
However, my parents
have become my best
friends.
They are my confidants.
I turn to them for
wisdom and advice.
They understand me like
no one else.
Biology is a powerful
thing.
Although I don't see
things the same way my
parents do, I love them
and respect their
viewpoints.
I love working out with
my dad and talking
about big ideas with my
mom.
I couldn't imagine not
being close to them.
If your parents are
still around, rekindle
those ties or increase
the flame.
You'll find enormous joy in
those relationships.
Eat at least one meal
with your family per day.
If possible, eat a sit
down meal with your
loved ones daily.
It doesn't matter if
it's breakfast, lunch,
or dinner.
We've become so high
paced in the world that
everything we do is on
the go.
We've forgotten what it
means to just be with
our loved ones.
Eating together creates
a sense of community
like nothing else.
Teens who have fewer
than three family dinners
a week are 3.5 times
more likely to have
abused prescription drugs
and to have used
illegal drugs other than
marijuana, three times
more likely to have
used marijuana, more
than 2.5 times more
likely to have smoked
cigarettes, and 1.5 times
more likely to have
tried alcohol, according
to the CASA report.
Never forget where you
came from.
It's easy when you
achieve any level of
success to believe you
are solely responsible
for that success.
It's easy to forget
where you came from.
It's easy to forget all
the sacrifices other
people have made to get
you where you are.
It's easy to see yourself
as superior to other
people.
Burn all your bridges and
you'll have no human
connection left.
In that internal cave of
isolation, you'll lose
your mind and identity,
becoming a person you
never intended to be.
Humility, gratitude,
and recognition of your
blessings keeps your
success in proper
perspective.
You couldn't do what
you have without the
help of countless other
people.
You are extremely lucky
to be able to contribute
in the way you have.

Think and Grow Rich
Define what wealth and
happiness mean to you.
Be everything to
everybody and you'll be
nothing for yourself.
John Rushton
No two human beings are
the same, so why should
we have one standard of
success?
Seeking society's standard
of success is an endless
rat race.
There will always be someone
better than you.
You'll never have the time
to do everything.
Instead, you recognize
that every decision has
opportunity cost.
When you choose one thing,
you simultaneously don't
choose several others.
And that's okay.
Actually, it's beautiful
because we get to choose
our ultimate ideal.
We must define success,
wealth, and happiness in
our own terms because if
we don't, society will for
us and we will always fall
short.
We'll always be left
wanting.
We'll always be stuck
comparing ourselves and
competing with other
people.
Our lives will be an
endless race for the next
best thing.
We'll never experience
contentment.
Change the way you think,
feel, and act about
money.
Most people have an
unhealthy relationship
with money.
It's not necessarily
their fault.
It's what they were
taught.
In order to change your
financial world, you need
to alter your paradigm and
feelings about money.
Here are some key beliefs
the most successful people
in the world have.
In a free market economy,
anyone can make as much
money as they want.
Your background, highest
level of education, or IQ,
is irrelevant when it
comes to earning money.
The bigger the problem
you solve, the more
money you make.
Expect to make lots of
money.
Think big.
$100,000, $500,000, or
why not $1,000,000?
What you focus on expands.
If you believe in scarcity,
you'll have little.
If you believe there is
unlimited abundance,
you'll attract abundance.
When you create
incredible value for
others, you have the
right to make as much
money as you want.
You're not going to be
discovered, saved, or
made rich by someone
else.
If you want to be
successful, you have to
build it yourself.
When you develop a
healthy relationship, you
will have more.
You won't spend money on
the crap most people
waste their money on.
You'll focus more on
value than price.
$1 is a lot of money.
I was recently in
Walmart with my mother-in-law
buying a few groceries.
While we were in the
checkout line, I pointed
an item out to her I
thought was interesting.
Honestly, can't remember
what it is anymore.
What stuck out to me is
that she said,
$1?
That's a lot of money.
Why this surprised me is
that my in-laws are not
short of money.
Actually, this happened
while we were on a
family trip, 30-plus people,
at Disney World, the whole
thing being paid for by
them.
Understanding the value of
$1 is the same as coming
to appreciate the value
of time.
To thoughtlessly spend
$1 may not seem like a
big deal, but it actually
is.
That frivolous spending
compounded over a long
enough time could be
millions.
And the truth is, most
millionaires are self-made,
80% being first-generation
rich and 75% being
self-employed.
Not getting paid hourly
challenges you to take
more responsibility for
every minute and every
dollar.
Consequently, a great
majority of millionaires
are extremely frugal, or
at least highly mindful,
with their money.
Retirement should never
be the goal.
To retire is to die.
Pablo Casals
The most powerful way to
punch someone in the face
is to aim a foot behind
their face.
That way you have full
momentum and power when
you make contact.
If you aim only for the
face itself, by the time
you reach it you'll have
already begun slowing down.
Thus your punch will not
be as powerful as you
intended it to be.
Retirement is the same
way.
Most people planning for
retirement begin slowing
down in their 40s and
50s.
The sad part is, as
momentum-based beings,
when you begin to slow
down, you start a hard-to-
reverse decaying process.
Research has found that
retirement often increases
the difficulty of mobility
and daily activities,
increases the likelihood of
becoming ill, and
decreases mental health.
But retirement is a
20th century phenomena.
And actually, the
foundations undergirding
this outdated notion
make little sense in
modern and future
society.
For instance, due to
advances in health care,
65 is not considered
old age anymore.
When the social security
system was designed,
the planners chose age
65 because the average
lifespan was age 63 at the
time.
Thus the system was
designed only for those
who were really in need,
not to create a culture of
people being supported by
others' labor.
Furthermore, the perception
that people over 65 can't
provide meaningful work no
longer makes sense either.
Retirement became a thing
when most work was manual
labor, but today's work is
more knowledge-based.
And if there's anything
lacking in today's society,
it's wisdom, which people
in their later years have
spent a lifetime refining.
Retirement should never be
the goal.
We are fully capable to work
in some capacity until our
final breath.
My 92-year-old grandfather,
Rex, was a fighter pilot in
World War II.
In the past five years, he
has written three books.
He goes to bed every night
at 8 p.m. and wakes up
every morning at 4.30 a.m.
He spends the first 2.5 hours
of his day watching
inspirational and
instructional content on
television.
He then eats breakfast at
7 a.m. and spends his day
reading, writing, connecting,
and serving people, and even
doing physical labor around
his son's, my dad's, house.
He even walks around his
neighborhood proselyting his
faith and asking random
strangers how he can help
them.
I have no intention of
stopping or slowing down.
Contrary to popular belief,
humans are like wine and get
better with age.
You earn as much money as
you want to.
Most people say they want
to be successful.
But if they really wanted to,
they'd be successful.
I used to tell people,
I wish I played the piano.
Then someone said,
no, you don't.
If you did, you'd make the
time to practice.
I've since stopped saying
that because he was right.
Life is a matter of
priority and decision.
And when it comes to money,
in a free market economy,
you can make as much money
as you choose.
The question is, how much
money do you really want
to make?
Instead of vegging on social
media day after day,
year after year, you could
spend an hour or two each
day building something of
value, like yourself.
In the book, Think and Grow
Rich, Napoleon Hill invites
readers to write down on a
piece of paper the amount
of money they want to make
and to put a timeline on it.
This single act will challenge
you to think and act in new
ways to create the future
of your wanting.
For example, despite growing
up so poor that for a time
his family lived in their
Volkswagen van on a
relative's lawn, Jim Carrey
believed in his future.
Every night in the late
1980s, Carrey would drive
atop a large hill that
looked down over Los Angeles
and visualize directors
valuing his work.
At the time, he was a broke
and struggling young comic.
One night in 1990, while
looking down on Los Angeles
and dreaming of his future,
Carrey wrote himself a check
for $10 million and put in
the notation line for acting
services rendered.
He dated the check for
Thanksgiving 1995 and stuck
it in his wallet.
He gave himself five years
and just before Thanksgiving
of 1995, he got paid
$10 million for Dumb and
Dumber.
Earning money is moral.
For better or worse,
humans are holistic.
Even the human body does
best when its spiritual and
physical sides are
synchronized.
People's bodies perform
best when their brains are
on board with the program.
Helping your mind to believe
what you do is good,
noble, and worthwhile in
itself helps to fuel your
energies and propel your
efforts.
Rabbi Daniel Lapin
I know so many people who
genuinely believe making
money is immoral and that
people with money are evil.
They believe those who seek
profits force those weaker
than them to buy their
products.
Money is not evil, but neutral.
It is a symbol of perceived
value.
If I'm selling a pair of shoes
for $20 and someone decides to
buy them, they perceive the
shoes to be worth more than
the $20 or they wouldn't buy
them.
I'm not forcing them to buy my
shoes.
It's their choice.
Thus, value exchange is win-win
and based purely on perception.
Value is subjective.
If you offered that same person
$20 for the shoes they just
bought, they probably wouldn't
sell them.
They see them as worth more
than $20.
But what if you offered $30?
They still might not sell them.
There is no correct price for
goods and services.
The correct price is the
perceived worth from the
customer.
If the price is too high, the
customer won't exchange their
money for it.
We are extremely lucky to live
in a society with a system of
money.
It allows us to borrow, lend,
and leverage.
Our ability to scale our work
would be enormously limited in
a bartering and trading system.
Earning money is a completely
moral pursuit when it is done
with honesty and integrity.
In fact, if you don't feel
moral about the work you're
doing, you should probably
change your job.
When you believe in the value
you provide so much that you
are doing people a disservice by
not offering them your
services, you are on track to
creating colossal value.
Our work should be a reflection
of us.
It's always their choice whether
they perceive the value in what
we're offering or not.
Save 10% or more of your
income.
I would have saved 10%
automatically from my paycheck
by direct deposit into a
savings account earning the
best possible interest
compounded daily.
I would have also disciplined
myself to deposit 10% of any
additional money from gifts,
refunds, or other earned
income.
I would have bought a small
house outright with the money
I had saved.
Instead of renting an
apartment for over 30 years,
I would have found a job that
I loved and devoted my life to
it.
At least you could be happy
even if you were not where you
wanted to be financially.
Hope this helps someone out
there.
D.
Laurencer.
Tithing yourself is a core
principle of wealth creation.
Most people pay other people
first.
Most people live above their
means.
In total, American consumers
owe $11.85 trillion in debt,
an increase of 1.4% from last
year,
$918.5 billion in credit card
debt,
$8.09 trillion in mortgages,
$1.19 trillion in student loans,
an increase of 5.9% from last
year.
The U.S. Census in 2010
reported that there were
234.56 million people over the
age of 18 years old,
suggesting the average adult owes
$3,761 in revolving credit to
lenders.
Across the average household,
American adults also owe $11,244
in student loans, $8,163 on
their autos, and $70,322 on
their mortgage.
Simply switching to home-brewed
coffee will save you an average
of $64.48 per month, or $2 per
day, or $773.80 per year.
By putting the savings into a
mutual fund with average earnings
of 6.5% interest and reinvesting
the dividends into more mutual
funds over a decade, the $64.48
saved every month would grow into
$10,981.93.
Tithe or give 10% of your income
away.
One gives freely, yet grows all the
richer.
Proverbs 11, verse 24
Many of the wealthiest people in the
world attribute their healthy
financial life and abundance to
giving some of it away.
Most people are trying to accumulate
as much as they can.
However, a natural principle of
wealth creation is generosity.
As Joe Polish has said, the world
gives to the givers and takes from
the takers.
From a spiritual perspective,
everything we have is gods or the
earths.
We are merely stewards over our
possessions.
When we die, we don't take our money
with us.
So why hoard it?
As you give generously and wisely,
you'll be stunned by the increases
in your earning potential.
You'll develop traits needed for
radical wealth creation.
Buy a small place rather than rent.
Unless you live in a big city,
which many of you do,
I'm baffled how many people pay
outlandish amounts on rent each
month.
When my wife and I moved to Clemson
to begin graduate school, we did a
lot of front-end work to ensure we'd
be able to buy a home.
What's shocking is that our mortgage
payment is far less than most of our
friends' rent payments.
By the end of our four years here in
Clemson, we'll have earned several
thousand dollars in equity and even
more in appreciation.
Conversely, many of our friends are
simply dumping hundreds of dollars
into someone else's pockets every
month.
Paying rent is like working hourly.
You get money while you're on the
clock.
When you're not on the clock, you get
no money.
Earning equity is like having residual
income.
Every month you pay down your
mortgage, you actually keep that
money.
So you're not spending to live like
most people do.
You're living for free while saving.
Often earning an appreciation.
Invest only in industries you are
informed about.
Warren Buffett doesn't invest in
technology because he doesn't
understand it.
Instead, he invests in banking and
insurance.
He's not a tech guy.
He invests in what he understands.
Yet so many people invest in things
they don't understand.
I've made that mistake.
I once invested several thousand
dollars in an overseas rice
distribution.
Although the investment sounded
incredible on paper, it's turned out
to be a disaster.
I didn't have the understanding to
make an informed decision.
I put my trust in someone else's
hands, and no one cares about your
success more than you do.
From now on, I'm going to responsibly
invest in things I can make informed
decisions on.
Create an automated income source
that takes care of the fundamentals.
We live in unprecedented times.
It has never been easier to create
automated income streams.
No matter your skill set and
interests, you can put a business in
place that runs 24-7 even while you're
sleeping, sitting on the beach, or
playing with your kids.
An entrepreneur is someone who works
for a few years like no one will,
so they can live the rest of their
life like no one else can.
If you want to free up your time and
energy for the things that matter
most, either invest in stuff you're
informed on, e.g. real estate,
businesses, mutual funds, or create a
business that doesn't require you, e.g.
create an online educational course
about something you're passionate about.
Have multiple income streams.
The more the better.
Most people's income comes from the
same source.
However, most wealthy people's income
comes from multiple sources.
I know people with hundreds of income
streams coming in each month.
What would happen if you set things up
so you were getting income from five
or ten different places each month?
What if several of those were
automated?
Again, with a few short years of
intentional and focused work, you can
have several income streams.
Part 2.
Developing the ability to consciously
design your ideal future.
8.
This is how you train your brain to get
what you really want.
Approximately six months ago, I got
serious about my goal to become a
professional writer.
I had written an e-book and was anxious
to know how to traditionally publish it.
I decided literary agents would be my
best source of advice.
After all, they know the publishing
industry back and forth, or so I thought.
After talking to five to ten different
agents about their coaching programs,
it became apparent my questions would
need to be answered elsewhere.
One particular conversation sticks out.
In order to even be considered by
agents and publishers, writers need to
already have a substantial readership,
i.e. a platform.
I told one of the agents my goal was to
have 5,000 blog subscribers by the end
of 2015.
She responded,
That would not be possible from where
you currently are.
These things take time.
You will not be able to get a publisher
for three to five years.
That's just the reality.
Reality to who?
I thought as I hung up the phone.
Never ask advice from.
In his book, The Compound Effect,
Darren Hardy said,
Never ask advice of someone with whom
you wouldn't want to trade places.
As I pondered this quote,
I realized I was asking the wrong
types of people for advice.
I needed to turn to people who had
actually walked where I wanted to walk.
Anyone can provide nebulous theory.
We spend our entire public education
learning theory from people who have
rarely walked the walk.
As Jack Black said in School of Rock,
Those who can't do, teach.
Similarly, there is an endless supply of
content being published every day by
people who rarely practice the virtues
they preach.
Contrary to theory, which cannot get you
very far in the end,
people who have actually been there
provide practical steps on what you need
to do, e.g. here are the five things
you should focus on and forget everything else.
Why You Need to Know What You Want
This is a fundamental irony of most people's lives.
They don't quite know what they want to do
with their lives, yet they are very active.
Ryan Holiday
Most kids go to college without a clue
why they are there.
They are floating along waiting to be told
what to do next.
They haven't seen or thought enough to know
what their ideal life would look like.
So how could they possibly know how to distinguish
good advice from bad?
Conversely, people who know what they want in life
see the world differently.
All people selectively attend to things
that interest or excite them.
For example, when you buy a new car,
you start to notice the same car everywhere.
How does this happen?
You didn't seem to notice that everyone
drove Malibus before.
Our brains are constantly filtering
an unfathomable amount of sensory inputs.
Sounds, smells, visuals, and more.
However, most of this information
goes consciously unrecognized.
Our focused attention is on what we care about.
Thus, some people only notice the bad
while others see the good in everything.
Some notice people wearing band shirts
while others notice anything fitness-related.
So when you decide what you want,
it's like buying a new car.
You start seeing it everywhere,
especially your news feeds.
What are you seeing everywhere?
This is perhaps the clearest reflection
of your conscious identity.
The Magical Things That Happen
When You Begin Paying Attention
How can you achieve your 10-year plan
in the next 6 months?
Peter Thiel
Wherever it is you want to go,
there is a long and conventional path.
And there are shorter,
less conventional approaches.
The conventional path is the outcome
of not paying attention.
It's what happens when you let other people
dictate your direction and speed in life.
However, once you know what you want
and it intensely arouses your attention,
you will notice simpler and easier solutions
to your questions.
What might have taken 10 years
in a traditional manner
takes only a few months
with the right information and relationship.
When the student is ready,
the teacher will appear.
Mabel Collins
When I decided I was serious
about becoming a writer,
the advice from the literary agents
couldn't work for me.
I was ready for the wisdom of people
who were where I wanted to be.
My vision was bigger
than the advice I was getting.
Around this same time
and out of nowhere,
I came across an online course
about guest blogging.
It must have popped in my news feeds
because of my previous searching.
I paid the $197,
went through the course,
and within two weeks
was getting articles featured
on multiple self-help blogs.
Within two months of taking the course,
I wrote a blog post that blew up.
Tim Ferriss has said,
One blog post can change your entire life.
This principle holds true
of anything you do.
One performance,
one audition,
one interview,
one music video,
one conversation.
Thus, the focus should be on quality
rather than quantity.
Two months after being told
it would take three to five years
to have a substantial following,
I was there.
When you know what you want,
you notice opportunities
most people aren't aware of.
You also have the rare courage
to seize those opportunities
without procrastination.
Courage doesn't just involve saying yes.
It also involves saying no.
But how could you possibly say no
to certain opportunities
if you don't know what you want?
You can't.
Like most people,
you'll be seduced by the best thing
that comes around.
But if you know what you want,
you'll be willing to pass up
even brilliant opportunities
because ultimately,
they are distractors
from your vision.
As Jim Collins said
in Good to Great,
a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity
is irrelevant
if it is the wrong opportunity.
Once-in-a-lifetime opportunities,
i.e. distractors,
pop up every day.
But the right opportunities
will only start popping up
when you decide what you want
and thus start selectively
attending to them.
Before you know it,
you'll be surrounded
by a network you love
and by mentors
showing you the fastest path.
Conclusion
Ralph Waldo Emerson
once said,
Once you make a decision,
the universe conspires
to make it happen.
This quote is completely true.
Once you know what you want,
you can stop taking advice
from just anyone.
You can filter out
the endless noise
and hone in on your truth.
Eventually,
you can train your conscious mind
to only focus on
what you really want in life.
Everything else
gets outsourced
and forgotten
by your subconscious.
Decide what you want
or someone else will.
You are the designer
of your destiny.
What will it be?

Mental creation
always precedes
physical creation.
Your vision
of who you want to be
is your greatest asset.
Create the highest,
grandest vision
possible for your life
because you become
what you believe.
Oprah Winfrey
No matter where you are
right now,
you can have
any future you want.
But one thing
is for certain,
what you plant,
you must harvest.
So please plant
with intention.
Mental creation
always precedes
physical creation.
The blueprint
you design in your head
becomes the life
you build.
Don't let society
tell you
how your house
should look.
You are an artist
and a creator.
Your life can be
exactly how you want it,
whether or not
it's considered
a mansion by others.
Home is where
your heart is.
Who you are
determines
what you can have.
There's a parable
of a wealthy parent
who hesitated
giving their unwise child
an inheritance,
knowing it would
undoubtedly be squandered.
The parent said
to the child,
All that I have
I desire to give you,
not only my wealth
but also my position
and standing among men.
That which I have
I can easily give you,
but that which I am
you must obtain
for yourself.
You will qualify
for your inheritance
by learning
what I have learned
and by living
as I have lived.
I will give you
the laws and principles
by which I have acquired
my wisdom and stature.
Follow my example,
mastering as I have mastered,
and you will become
as I am
and all that I have
will be yours.
Going through the motions
is not enough.
There isn't a checklist
of things you must do
to be successful.
You have to fundamentally
change who you are
to live at a higher level.
You must go from
doing to being
so that what you do
is a reflection
of who you are
and who you're becoming.
Once you've experienced
this change,
success will be natural.
After you become
a millionaire,
you can give
all of your money away
because what's important
is not the million dollars.
What's important
is the person
you have become
in the process
of becoming a millionaire.
Jim Rohn
I fully realize
that my future
is bright and powerful.
Free will
is a tricky subject.
Both spiritually
and psychologically,
the whole notion
is complex
and conflicting.
Do we really have free will?
To what extent
do we determine
the outcomes
of our lives?
The majority
of psychological theories
would suggest
that human beings
do not have free will,
but rather
that we are nothing more
than the clashing
of genes and environment.
No room
for consciously deciding
either of those things.
In similar fashion,
many religious philosophies
promote a God
hardly worthy of worship,
who despite having
the power
to save all,
predetermines
a select few,
leaving the rest
to spend eternity
tortured without explanation
or reason why.
Clearly,
internal wisdom
discerns both
of these ideas
as wrong,
if not radically incomplete.
But is our ability
to act
absolutely independent?
Surely not.
If I were to jump
off my back porch
in attempts of flying,
I would most certainly
be acted on
by gravitational forces.
Indeed,
there are constraints
on our freedom
to act.
However,
the flexibility
of those constraints
is proving
to be quite malleable.
We can consciously
change our environments,
and science
is even coming to grips
with the fact
that we can manipulate
our genetic expression.
Our free will
is contextual,
yet we have the power
to manipulate
the context,
including our beliefs
about that context.
And thus,
we have limitless options
regarding the course
our lives take.
In the movie
The Adjustment Bureau,
the main character
David Norris,
played by Matt Damon,
learns about a hidden
society of angels,
known as the Adjustment Bureau,
who ensure every person's life
goes according to
the plan.
According to David's plan,
he isn't supposed
to be with Elise,
a woman he feels
an innate
and deep connection toward.
The members
of the Adjustment Bureau
do all they can
to ensure David
and Elise's paths
don't cross.
But with a touch
of luck
and dogged determination,
David decides
he's going to have Elise
regardless of what
the plan dictates.
After risking everything
to have the person
he loves,
David inspires a member
of the Adjustment Bureau
who then takes David's case
to the chairman,
the creator
of each person's plan.
David's determination
and love
inspire even the chairman,
who then makes
David and Elise's plan
blank.
The film closes
with the following narration
by one of the members
of the Adjustment Bureau.
Most people live life
on the path
we set for them,
too afraid
to explore any other.
But once in a while,
people like you
come along
who knock down
all the obstacles
we put in your way.
People who realize
free will
is a gift
you'll never know
how to use
until you fight for it.
I think that's
the chairman's real plan.
That one day,
we won't write the plan.
You will.
Brilliant things
begin to happen
when you take extreme
ownership over your life.
When you're in complete
alignment with yourself,
you find that God
has given you the power
to choose for yourself.
And if you so choose,
that God will help you
along your way.
Matured at this stage,
you don't need to wonder
or worry about
how your future
will turn out.
Instead,
you are completely confident
about certain realizations.
These realizations,
which you decide,
although not yet manifested,
have already happened.
Thus,
they are as real
as anything else.
Your life then becomes
the natural unfolding
of something
you've consciously created
in your mind.
Choose to have faith
in something bigger
than yourself.
Skepticism is easy.
In the timeless book
Think and Grow Rich,
Napoleon Hill explains
that a fundamental principle
of wealth creation
is having faith,
which he defines
as visualization
and belief
in the attainment
of desire.
As he famously said,
whatever the mind
can conceive and believe,
the mind can achieve.
If you don't believe
in your dreams,
the chances of them
happening are slim to none.
But if you can come
to fully know
the things you seek
will occur,
the universe will conspire
to make it happen.
According to Hill,
see page 49
of Think and Grow Rich,
here's how that works.
Faith is the starting point
of all accumulation
of riches.
Faith is the basis
of all miracles
and mysteries
that cannot be analyzed
by the rules of science.
Faith is the element
that transforms
the ordinary vibration
of thought
created by the finite
mind of man
into the spiritual equivalent.
Faith is the only agency
through which
the cosmic force
of infinite intelligence
can be harnessed
and used.
Faith is the element,
the chemical,
which when mixed
with prayer
gives one direct
communication
with infinite intelligence.
Like expressing love,
in our culture
many have become
uncomfortable
with ideas like faith.
Yet to all of the best
business minds
in recent history,
faith was fundamental
to their success.
Make a bucket list
and actively
knock items off.
Most people
have it backwards.
They design their ambitions
around their life
rather than designing
their life
around their ambitions.
What are the things
you absolutely
must do
before you die?
Start there.
Then design your life
around those things.
Or as Stephen Covey
explained in
The Seven Habits
of Highly Effective People,
begin with the end
clearly in mind.
I have so much
to do today
that I'm going to need
to spend three hours
in prayer
in order to be able
to get it all done.
Martin Luther
Spending a good
chunk of time
at the beginning
of your day
in prayer and meditation
brings clarity
and perspective.
These activities
help you distinguish
the subtle signal
from the pervasive noise
all around you.
Almost everything
in life
is a distraction.
If you don't
put yourself
in a place
of clarity
and perspective
at the beginning
of each day,
you may spend
your entire day
on activities
taking you
in the wrong direction.
Prayer and meditation
also facilitate
radical insights
and inspiration.
During my morning
prayer and meditation,
I've gotten ideas
about articles to write
and people to reach out to.
Not only that,
but during my prayer
and meditation,
I visualize and decide
the best approach
to achieve my objectives,
often involving
reaching out to people
I don't know.
As a result,
I have intense levels
of confidence
and momentum
when I attack my day.
Spend your first
ten minutes
of the day in prayer.
Gratitude,
laughter,
and this question.
The first ten minutes
of your day
are without question
the most important.
They set the tone
for how the rest
of your day will be.
They reflect how you
will show up
to the world.
Will you be proactive
or reactive this day?
Will you be in a hurry
or purposeful?
Will you be guided
and inspired
or tossed to
and fro
with every email,
phone call,
interruption,
and distraction
that comes your way?
Will you be in control
of your time
or will time
be in control of you?
Will you be a leader
or a victim?
Will you take risks
or play safe?
Will you attract
abundance
or scarcity?
Will you be the recipient
of luck and miracles
or disappointment
and disaster?
Will you move toward
or away from
your hopes and dreams?
Robin Sharma,
author of
The Leader Without a Title,
spends the first
ten minutes of his day
praying,
laughing,
and asking himself
the question,
If this was the last day
of my life,
how would I spend it?
This question helps Sharma
ensure his day is spent
precisely how he feels
it should be.
My first ten minutes
are spent in prayer,
deeply expressing gratitude
for everything
in my present
and future life.
Additionally,
I visualize myself
achieving my day's
top priorities
and asking God
to elevate my performance
in everything I do.
When I walk away
from these ten minutes,
I know I'm in a position
of abundance and power.
I know I've become
a magnet for
incredible possibilities
and that the work
I'll do this day
will exceed
my natural abilities.
Pray and meditate
morning,
midday,
and night.
In a recent interview
at the Genius Network
Mastermind event,
Joe Polish asked
Tony Robbins
what he does
to get focused.
Do you meditate?
What do you do?
Joe asked,
I don't know
that I meditate.
I don't know
that I want to meditate
and think about nothing,
Tony responded.
My goal is clarity.
Instead of full-on meditation,
Tony has a morning routine
that includes
several breathing exercises
and visualization techniques
that get him
to a state of clarity
and focus.
For me,
I use prayer and pondering,
my version of meditation,
as the same vehicle.
Whatever your approach,
the goal should be
clarity and focus.
What do you want
to be about today?
What few things matter most
during the next 24 hours?
I've gotten the best results
as my morning prayer
and meditation
are motivational,
my afternoon prayer
and meditation
are strategic,
and my evening prayer
and meditation
are evaluative
and educational.
Spend 5-10 minutes
each day
visualizing
where you want to be.
Michael Phelps
visualized himself
winning races
every night
before going to bed.
Jim Carrey
visualized himself
becoming a successful actor.
Amazingly,
research has found
that visualization
is nearly as effective
as actually practicing
the behaviors
we seek to perform.
My wife and I
recently started visualizing
what our lives
will be like
two years from now
when we're done
with graduate school.
After we put the kids to bed,
we read an uplifting book
for 10 minutes,
then we spend
two minutes
visualizing
our future.
After we spend
two minutes
visualizing our futures,
we discuss
what we saw.
It's actually
a lot of fun
and has brought us
closer together.
If you're going
to be partners,
why not co-create
your future together?
To me,
it's the best way
to remain aligned
and not move
in opposite directions.
Mental creation
always precedes
physical creation.
When visualizing
your future,
don't visualize
what you think
may happen.
Rather,
visualize what you
want to happen.
As Abraham Lincoln
masterfully stated,
the best way
to predict your future
is to create it.

Your Daily Journal
The Gateway
to Your Future
The life of every man
is a diary
in which he means
to write one story
and writes another.
And his humblest hour
is when he compares
the volume
as it is
with what he vowed
to make it.
J.M. Barrie,
author of Peter Pan
You know exactly
what you want in life,
but you can't seem
to get there.
You have all these resolves.
You're going to get healthy.
You're going to write
that book.
You're going to be
more present
with your loved ones.
You're going to start
that home-based business.
You're going to learn
another language.
You're going to be
more patient and happy.
You're going to get
out of debt.
You're going to be
more organized.
You're going to be
a better friend.
You're going to overcome
bad habits.
But the problem is
doing these
is really hard
and it gets harder
every day.
Some days
it seems more realistic
to just give up entirely.
The whole
taking one step forward
and one or two steps
backward pattern
is getting old.
You've been telling yourself
for a long time
today is the day
only to fall into
old ways
before the day
or if you're lucky
the week is spent.
When there's a gap
between who you are
and who you intend
to be
you are incongruent
and unhappy.
You're torn
mentally exhausted
and regretful.
You always
slightly feel
like a fraud
to yourself
and probably
to the people
around you.
Conversely
Gandhi has said
happiness
is when what you think
what you say
and what you do
are in harmony.
The need
for a powerfully
transformative
keystone habit.
If you try
to tackle
everything wrong
in your life
you'll quickly
burn out
and quit.
It's happened
many times before.
Life is super busy.
You don't have
time to focus
on a thousand
different areas
of your life
to change.
That's exhausting
and frankly
not helpful.
More effective
than microscopically
analyzing your
sabotaging behaviors
is nailing down
a keystone habit
which tightly locks
all of your
other habits
in place.
Without the keystone
everything falls apart.
In his book
The Power of Habit
Charles Duhigg
describes keystone habits
as small changes
or habits
that people introduce
into their routines
that unintentionally
carry over
into other aspects
of their lives.
A person might
start exercising
once per week
and unknowing
begins eating better
and being more
productive at work.
She begins
smoking less
and showing more
patience with her
colleagues
and loved ones.
She uses her
credit card less
feels less stressed
and has increased
motivation toward her goals.
The ingrained patterns
in her brain
reform
and she becomes
an entirely
different person
all because
she started exercising
once per week.
You acquire
one of these habits
and everything
in your life
can change.
Keystone habits
spark a chain reaction
of other good habits
and can rapidly
alter every aspect
of your life.
journal every day.
Journaling daily
is the most potent
and powerful
keystone habit
you can acquire.
If done correctly,
you will show up
better in every area
of your life.
Every area.
Without question,
journaling has by far
been the number one
factor to everything
I've done well
in my life.
The problem is,
most people have
tried and failed
at journaling
several times.
It's something
you know
you should do
but can never
seem to pin down.
After you read
this post,
you'll never want
to miss another
day of journaling
again.
Here's why.
Journaling
optimizes
your creative
potential.
Most people
live their lives
on other people's
terms.
Their days
are spent
achieving
other people's
goals
and submitting
to other people's
agendas.
Their lives
have not been
consciously organized
in such a way
that they command
every waking
and sleeping
moment of their
life.
Instead,
they relentlessly
react at every
chance they get.
For example,
most people wake up
and immediately
check their phone
or email.
In spare seconds,
we hop on Facebook
and check the news feed.
We've become
addicted to input.
Or in other words,
we've become addicted
to reactively being
guided by other
people's agendas.
On the other hand,
Josh Waitzkin,
author of The Art of
Learning,
wakes up and
immediately writes
in his journal
for 30 minutes.
He does this
because while
he's been sleeping,
his subconscious
mind has been
brewing,
scheming,
problem-solving,
and learning.
So when Josh
wakes up,
he rushes to
a quiet place
and engages
in a bust of
intellectual
and creative flow.
I recently wrote
about the importance
of morning routines.
If I were to
rewrite that post now,
I'd include my journal.
I've been doing
this the past few weeks
and it's reframed
my entire approach
to life.
Additionally,
I've never
before had
so many
creative ideas
crystallize.
Creators focus
on outputs
rather than
the general
populace
who focus
on inputs.
In their free
moments,
creators utilize
their subconscious
breakthroughs.
Their days are
filled with
creative bursts,
making them
incredible at
their craft.
If you want
to have more
creative flow
in your life,
stop checking
your social media
and email so much.
Check them
once or twice
per day.
Detach from
the addiction
to numb
your mind
and escape
reality.
Instead,
get lost
in the creative
projects you've
always wanted
to do.
Journaling
accelerates
your ability
to manifest
your goals.
As part
of your
morning creative
burst,
use your journal
to review
and hone
your daily
to-do list.
Review and hone
your life vision
and big picture
goals.
As you read
and rewrite
your goals
daily,
they'll become
forged into
your subconscious
mind.
Eventually,
your dreams
and vision
will consume
your inner
world
and quickly
become
your physical
reality.
Journaling
creates a
springboard
for daily
recovery.
People struggle
drastically
to detach
from work.
More now
than ever,
we fail
to live
presently.
Our loved
ones are
lucky to
experience
a small
percentage
of our
attention
while they're
with us.
However,
utilizing your
journal
can curb
this mismanagement.
At the end
of your workday,
reopen your journal
and review
your to-do list
from that day.
If your morning
journal session
was excellent,
you'll have
likely gotten
everything done
you intended
to do.
Private victories
always precede
public victories.
Journal sessions
are your post-work
reflection time.
Account to yourself
what you got
done that day
and what needs
to be moved
to tomorrow.
Write the things
you learned
and experienced.
Lastly,
direct your subconscious
by writing about
things you want
to focus on
tomorrow.
As you put work
behind you
for the evening,
your subconscious
will be preparing
a feast for you
to consume
during your next
morning's
creative and
planning session.
This end-of-the-workday
journal session
need not be as long
as the morning session.
Greg McKeown,
author of Essentialism,
recommends writing
far less than you
want to,
only a few sentences
or paragraphs at most.
This will help you
avoid burnout.
A primary objective
of this session
is to mentally
turn off work mode.
Just as in
physical training,
you need to rest
and recover
between work days
in order to get
stronger.
Use this session
to completely
unplug and detach
from work.
This is your time
to recover
and be present
with your loved ones.
There is more
to life than work.
The higher quality
your recovery,
the more potent
and powerful
your creative sessions
will be.
Journaling generates
clarity and congruence.
This keystone habit
has so much power.
By journaling
in the morning
and evening,
you'll quickly see
the incongruencies
in your life.
You'll see crystal
clearly what needs
to be removed
and what should be
included in your life.
Journaling is a
beautiful and powerful
facilitator of
self-discovery.
My own journaling
is how I've come
to form my sense
of identity
and path in life.
Not only will you
have more clarity
about your path in life,
but journaling
improves your ability
to make small
and large decisions
along the way.
On the pages
of your journal
will be the future
world you are
creating for yourself.
You are the author
of your life's story.
You deserve to be happy.
You have the power
to create
whatever life
you want.
As the designer
of your world,
it is detailed
as you desire.
Journaling clears
your emotions.
Several research studies
have found that
writing in your journal
reduces stress.
These benefits include
reducing scatter
in your life,
increased focus,
greater stability,
deeper level of learning,
order, action,
and release,
holding thoughts still
so they can be changed
and integrated,
releasing pent-up thoughts
and emotions,
empowerment,
bridging inner thinking
with outer events,
detaching and letting go
of the past,
allowing you to
re-experience the past
with today's adult mind.
When you are in an
intensely emotional mood,
journaling can help you
more fully experience
and understand
those emotions.
After you've vented
on the pages of your journal,
you'll quickly find a release.
Objectivity will return
and you'll be able
to move forward.
Without a journal,
intense emotional experiences
can be crippling
for hours,
days,
and even years.
However,
an honest and inspired
journal session
can be the best
form of therapy,
quickly returning you
better and smarter
than you were before.
Journaling ingrains
your learning.
Humans are bad
at retaining information.
We forget most
of what we read and hear.
However,
when you write down
the things you've learned,
you retain them
far better.
Even if you never re-read
what you've written,
the simple act
of writing something down
increases brain development
and memory.
Neurologically,
when you listen to something,
a different part of your brain
is engaged
than when you write it down.
Memory recorded
by listening
does not discriminate
important
from non-important information.
However,
writing creates
spatial regions
between important
and non-important
pieces of information,
allowing your memory
to target
and ingrain
the important stuff
you want to remember.
Furthermore,
the act of writing
allows your subconscious mind
to work out problems
in unique ways,
intensifying the learning process.
You'll be able
to work out problems
and get insights
while you ponder
and write about
the things you're learning.
Journaling increases
your gratitude.
Even if you start
a journal session
in a bad mood,
the insight writing brings
has a subtle way
of shifting your mind
towards gratitude.
When you start writing
what you're grateful for,
new chambers of thought
open in the palace
of your mind.
You'll often need
to put your pen down
and take a few
overwhelming breaths.
You'll be captivated
not only by the amazing
things in your life,
but by the awe
and brilliance
of life in general.
As part of your
morning and post-work
journaling sessions,
be sure to include
some gratitude
in your writing.
It will change
your entire life orientation
from scarcity
to abundance.
The world will increasingly
become your oyster.
Gratitude journaling
is a scientifically
proven way
to overcome
several psychological challenges.
The benefits
are seemingly endless.
Here are just a few.
Gratitude makes you happier.
Gratitude makes other people
like you.
Gratitude makes you healthier.

your decision-making.
Gratitude increases
your productivity.
Journaling unfolds
the writer in you.
I became a writer
through journaling.
While I was on a
mission trip, I wrote
in my journal for
one to two hours per
day.
I got lost in flow
and fell in love
with the writing
process.
If you want to
become a writer one
day, start by
journaling.
Journaling can help
you develop strong
writing habits,
help you discover
your voice, clear
your mind, and
crystallizes your
ideas.
Get closer to the
10,000 hours Malcolm
Gladwell says are
required to become
world-class in what
you do.
Produce gems you
could use in your
other writing.
Journaling records
your life history.
I started journaling
in 2008 after reading
an article about the
importance of journal
writing.
In the article, the
author described how
much journaling had
changed her life.
She said that after
all these years, she
now has 38 recorded
volumes of personal
and family history.
After finishing that
article, I have never
stopped writing in my
journal.
In my family room on a
bookshelf are 20-plus
journals filled with my
thoughts and experiences.
I am certain they will
be cherished by my
ancestors as I have
cherished the writing of
my loved ones who have
passed on.

Reframing Your
Perceptual Reality

Gratitude
The Mother
of All Virtues
Gratitude is the
cure-all for all
the world's problems
It has been called
the mother of all
virtues by the
Roman philosopher
Cicero
When you practice
gratitude
your world changes
There is no
objective reality
All people perceive
reality as they
selectively attend
to things that are
meaningful to them
Hence some people
notice the good
while others
notice the bad
Gratitude is having
an abundance mindset
When you think
abundantly
the world is your
oyster
There is limitless
opportunity and
possibility for you
People are magnets
When you're grateful
for what you have
you will attract more
of the positive
and good
Gratitude is contagious
Psychological research
has found that
people who practice
gratitude consistently
report a host of
benefits
Physical
Stronger immune
systems
Less bothered by
aches and pains
Lower blood pressure
Exercise more and
take better care of
their health
Sleep longer and
feel more refreshed
upon waking
Psychological
Higher levels of
positive emotions
More alert, alive,
and awake
More joy and
pleasure
More optimism and
happiness
Social
More helpful,
generous, and
compassionate
More forgiving,
more outgoing
Feel less lonely
and isolate
Gratitude may be the
most important key to
success.
It has been called
the mother of all
virtues.
Gratitude during
difficult times
Psychological research
has found time and
again that gratitude
can help you during
challenging and
difficult times.
In fact, Dr. Robert
Emmons, one of the
world's leading
authorities on
gratitude, argues
that gratitude is
not only helpful in
getting through
difficult times, it is
essential.
It's important to
realize that you can
be grateful without
actually feeling
grateful.
Sometimes, life just
sucks, and it
doesn't feel good, but
you can still focus on
the good, and
eventually, your
feelings will follow.
What you focus on
expands.
Also, the goal of
gratitude is not to
ignore or deny the
pain or difficulty you
are experiencing.
Rather, the goal is to
acknowledge it and
reframe your story about
your pain and
difficulty.
As my wife always
says, crisis plus
times equals humor, and
the sooner you can
laugh, the less serious
the crisis.
It can take a few
days to reframe our
story or experience.
The sooner, the
better.
13.
There is no way to
happiness.
Most people are
chasing happiness.
They believe it's on
the other side of
success.
That you must first
do or have something
before you can be
happy.
Sean Acker, a
prominent scholar on
the science of
happiness, explains that
most parents, teachers,
leaders, and people in
general believe the
following about
happiness.
If I work harder, I'll
be more successful.
If I'm more successful,
then I'll be happy.
The problem with this
approach, Acker says, is
that it's scientifically
broken and backwards.
Every time your brain
has a success, you
change the goalpost of
success.
For example, you get
good grades, now you
need better grades.
You made a good
income, now you need a
bigger income.
Every time you hit a
target, the target moves.
Thus, if happiness is on
the opposite side of
success, your brain never
gets there, we've pushed
happiness over the
cognitive horizon as a
society, says Acker.
But our brain works in the
opposite order.
If you can be positive and
happy in the present, you'll
actually show up better in
life.
Thus, happiness is what
actually leads to success,
not the other way around.
Stop trying to pursue
happiness.
You'll never get there.
Instead, deploy strategies
that will increase your
brain positivity now.
When your brain is
positively positioned, you
have an increased flow of
dopamine, which makes you
happier and increases all
the learning centers of your
brain, e.g. creativity,
problem solving, etc.
Scientifically, the following
behaviors have been found to
create lasting positive
changes to your brain
functioning.
Write down three new things
you're grateful for each day.
This will change your
selective attention toward
the positive in the world
rather than the negative.
Journaling about one
positive experience you've
had that day allows you to
relive it.
Exercising every day teaches
you that your behaviors
matter and that they
dramatically impact you and
those around you.
Meditating each day helps
you overcome the cultural
ADHD of constant distraction.
It helps you focus on what's
really important.
Random or conscious acts of
kindness every single day.
This could be as simple as
sending a kind email to
someone, smiling, or giving
a compliment.
By spending just two minutes
per day on each of these
activities for 21 days, you
can rewire your brain toward
the positive.
As a result, you will live
from a more optimistic and
creative approach.
There is no way to
happiness.
There is no way to
happiness.
Happiness is the way.
Thich Nhat Hanh.
Most people believe they
must first have something,
e.g. money, time, or love
before they can do what they
want to do, e.g. travel the
world, write a book, start a
business, or have a romantic
relationship, which will
ultimately allow them to be
something, e.g. happy,
peaceful, content, motivated,
or in love.
Paradoxically, this have-do-be
paradigm must actually be
reversed to experience happiness,
success, or anything else you
desire.
First, you be whatever it is you
want to be, e.g. happy,
compassionate, peaceful, wise,
or loving.
Then you start doing things from
this space of being.
Almost immediately, what you are
doing will bring about the things
you want to have.
We attract into our lives what we
are.
For example, Scott Adams, the
creator of the famous comic
series Dilbert, attributes his
success to the use of positive
affirmations.
Fifteen times each day, he wrote
the sentence on a piece of
paper, I, Scott Adams, will
become a syndicated cartoonist.
The process of writing this
fifteen times a day buried this
idea deep into his subconscious,
putting Adams' conscious mind on
a treasure hunt for what he
sought.
The more he wrote, the more he
could see opportunities before
invisible to him.
And shortly thereafter, he was a
highly famous syndicated
cartoonist.
It couldn't not happen.
I personally apply a similar
principle, but write my goal in
present tense.
For example, rather than saying,
I will become a syndicated
cartoonist, I write, I am a
syndicated cartoonist.
Writing it in the present tense
highlights the fact that you are
being who you want to be, which
will then inform what you do, and
ultimately, who you become.
It's never as good as you think it
will be.
One of the enemies of happiness is
adaptation, says Dr. Thomas
Djilovic, a psychology professor
at Cornell University, who has
studied the relationship between
money and happiness for over two
decades.
We buy things to make us happy,
and we succeed, but only for a
while.
New things are exciting to us at
first, but then we adapt to them,
Djilovic further states.
Actually, savoring the
anticipation or idea of a desired
outcome is generally more
satisfying than the outcome
itself.
Once we get what we want, whether
that's wealth, health, or
excellent relationships, we adapt
and the excitement fades.
Often, the experiences we're
seeking end up being underwhelming
and even disappointing.
I love watching this phenomena in
our foster kids.
They feel like they need a certain
toy or the universe will explode.
Their whole world revolves around
getting this one thing.
Yet once we buy the toy for them,
it's not long before the joy fades,
and they want something else.
Until you appreciate what you
currently have, more won't make
your life better.
It's never as bad as you think it
will be.
Just as we deceive ourselves into
believing something will make us
happier than it will, we also
deceive ourselves into believing
something will be harder than it
will.
The longer you procrastinate or
avoid doing something, the more
painful in your head it becomes.
However, once you take action, the
discomfort is far less severe than
you imagined.
Even to extremely difficult things
humans adapt.
I recently sat on a plane with a
lady who has 17 kids.
Yes, you read that correctly.
After having eight of her own, her
and her husband felt inspired to
foster four siblings whom they
later adopted.
A few years later, they took on
another five foster siblings whom
they also adopted.
Of course, the initial shock to the
system impacted her entire family.
But they're handling it.
And believe it or not, you could
handle it too.
If you had to.
The problem with dread and fear is
that it holds people back from
taking on big challenges.
What you will find, no matter how
big or small the challenge, is that
you will adapt to it.
When you consciously adapt to
enormous stress, you evolve.
You have enough already.
In an interview at the annual
Genius Network event in 2013,
Tim Ferriss was asked,
With all of your various roles,
do you ever get stressed out?
Do you ever feel like you've
taken on too much?
Ferriss responded,
Of course I get stressed out.
If anyone says they don't get
stressed out, they're lying.
But one thing that mitigates that
is taking time each morning to
declare and focus on the fact that
I have enough.
I have enough.
I don't need to worry about
responding to every email each
day.
If they get mad, that's their
problem.
Ferriss was later asked during the
same interview,
After having read the four-hour
workweek, I got the impression
that Tim Ferriss doesn't care
about money.
You talked about how you travel
the world without spending any
money.
Talk about the balance and
ability to let go of caring
about making money.
Ferriss responded,
It's totally okay to have lots of
nice things.
If it is addiction to wealth,
like in Fight Club, the things
you own end up owning you, and
it becomes a surrogate for things
like long-term health and
happiness, connection, then it
becomes a disease state.
But if you can have nice things
and not fear having them taken
away, then it's a good thing,
because money is a really valuable
tool.
If you appreciate what you
already have, then more will be a
good thing in your life.
If you feel the need to have more
to compensate for something
missing in your life,
you'll always be left wanting,
no matter how much you acquire
or achieve.

Rapid Goal Achievement
How you set up the game is more
important than the game itself.
People may spend their whole lives
climbing the ladder of success
only to find, once they reach the
top, that the ladder is leaning
against the wrong wall.
Thomas Merton
Too many people are playing the
wrong game, a losing game from the
onset, and it hurts like hell.
It's how you ruin your life without
even knowing it.
More important than playing the game
is how the game is set up.
How you set up the game determines
how you play, and it's better to win
first, then play.
How does this work?
Start from the end
and work backwards.
Rather than thinking about what's
plausible, or what's expected,
or what makes sense,
start with what you want.
Or as Covey put it in Seven Habits,
begin with the end
clearly in mind.
Once that's nailed down,
then dictate the daily,
weekly, monthly, and yearly
behaviors that will facilitate that.
Jim Carrey wrote himself
a $10 million check.
Then he set out to earn it.
He won the game first,
then played.
So can you.
Become unstoppable at setting
and achieving your goals
and experiments.
You can achieve any goals you want,
no matter how big.
Seriously.
There is no right or wrong way
to approach goal setting,
but science confirms
that certain approaches
are better than others.
Here's what you need to know.
The more clearly to find your goal,
the more likely you will achieve it.
Write it down in detail.
Write it again.
Write it 15 times every day
and in present tense,
e.g. I am the President
of the United States.
Make your goal public
to add some positive pressure.
Give your goal a timeline.
According to Parkinson's law,
people fill the time
allotted to them.
So if you have a lot of time,
you'll waste it.
If you have a short amount of time,
you'll get to it.
According to psychological research,
it takes 66 days
to form a habit.
So,
do your goal every day
for two months.
Then it will take care of itself
and stop requiring
so much willpower.
Although common wisdom
would suggest
having long-term goals,
projecting your future
more than a few years
is little more than guesswork.
Actually,
to live at the razor's edge
of his potential,
Tim Ferriss doesn't have
long-term goals.
Instead,
he does three- to six-month
experiments,
which he puts
all of his energy into.
He has no clue
what doors may open
as a result of these experiments,
so why make long-term plans?
He'd rather respond
to the brilliant
and best opportunities
that arise,
taking him in now
unforeseen directions.
I've recently adopted
Ferriss's concept
of doing short-term experiments.
This has changed
my approach to my work.
For example,
a few months ago,
I stumbled upon
a personal development article
that had been shared
over one million times
on social media.
I decided to perform
an experiment
to attempt creating
an article that would
also get one million shares.
The result was
a nearly 8,000-word article
called
50 Ways Happier,
Healthier,
and More Successful People
Live on Their Own Terms.
Although the article
wasn't shared a million times,
the results were profound
and unexpected.
An editor at Time
asked if they could
syndicate the article.
Additionally,
the article brought
several thousand new readers,
including some of my heroes,
and subscribers to my blog.
Lastly,
it brought on
several new coaching clients.
That was just
one short experiment
that took a week
to perform.
Experiments are a fun way
to pursue goals
because they allow you
to get innovative and bold.
Because experiments
are short-term
and thus relatively low-risk,
they should be moonshots.
Why play small?
So take your goal
and 10 times it.
Make it audacious
and even absurd.
If it doesn't excite
and even scare you,
you're playing too small.
If you 10 times your vision,
don't neglect 10 times
in your effort,
which means overestimating
what would be required
to achieve your goal.
What's the worst
that could happen?
You waste a few months
and learn a lot
while doing it?
Do something every day
that terrifies you.
A person's success in life
can usually be measured
by the number
of uncomfortable conversations
he or she
is willing to have.
Tim Ferriss
But you don't have
to constantly
be battling your fears.
Actually,
Darren Hardy has said
that you can be a coward
99.9305556%
of the time
to be exact.
You only need
to be courageous
for 20 seconds
at a time.
20 seconds of fear
is all you need.
If you courageously
confront fear
for 20 seconds
every single day
before you know it,
you'll be in a different
socioeconomic
and social situation.
Make that call.
Ask that question.
Pitch that idea.
Post that video.
Whatever it is
you feel you want to do,
do it.
The anticipation
of the event
is far more painful
than the event itself.
So just do it.
And end
the inner conflict.
In most cases,
your fears
are unfounded.
As Seth Godin
has explained,
our comfort zone
and our safety zone
are not the same thing.
It is completely safe
to make an uncomfortable
phone call.
You are not going to die.
Don't equate the two.
Recognize that
most things
outside your comfort zone
are completely safe.
Start Before You're Ready
In a recent interview
with Success Magazine,
Marie Forleo
told Darren Hardy
that one of the keys
to becoming successful
is starting
before you feel ready.
Get experience.
Make mistakes.
Stop thinking about it.
Throwing yourself
into the fire
is the fastest way
to learn
and adapt to something.
You're immediately
exposed and naked.
You're forced
to quickly learn
on your feet.
But most people
hide until they feel ready,
which is far after
they should have started.
Perfectionism
leads to procrastination
and often never
doing or trying.
Paralysis
by analysis.
No more analyzing.
Learn as you go.
Then,
your learning
will have concrete context
rather than
abstract guessing.
You'll never feel ready.
You get ready
through engaging
in an activity,
by getting your hands dirty,
not by thinking about it.
Every day
you say no
to your dreams.
You might be pushing
back your dreams
a whole six months,
a whole year.
That one single day,
that one day
you didn't get up,
could have pushed
your stuff back
I don't know how long.
Eric Thomas
in Unbroken
Make your bed
first thing in the morning.
According to
psychological research,
people who make
their bed in the morning
are happier
and more successful
than those who don't.
If that's not enough,
here's more.
71% of bedmakers
consider themselves happy,
while 62% of non-bedmakers
are unhappy.
Bedmakers are also
more likely
to like their jobs,
own a home,
exercise regularly,
and feel well-rested,
whereas non-bedmakers
hate their jobs,
rent apartments,
avoid the gym,
and wake up tired.
Crazy, right?
Something so simple.
Yet,
when you make your bed
first thing in the morning,
you knock off
your first accomplishment
of the day.
This puts you
in a mindset of winning.
Do it.
It only takes 30 seconds.
Make one audacious
request per week.
What do you have to lose?
Rainmakers generate revenue
by making asks.
They ask for donations.
They ask for contracts.
They ask for deals.
They ask for opportunities.
They ask to meet with leaders
or speak to them
over the phone.
They ask for publicity.
They come up with ideas
and ask for a few minutes
of your time to pitch it.
They ask for help.
Don't let rainmaking
deter you from your dream.
It's one of the barriers
to entry.
And you can overcome it.
Once you taste
the sweet victory
of a positive response,
you'll not only become
comfortable with it,
you might even enjoy it.
But making asks
is the only way
to bring your dream
to life.
Ben Armand
I got into graduate school
way after applications
were due
because I asked.
I've gotten free
NBA tickets
by asking a few players
I saw at a hotel.
I've gotten my work
published on high-tier
outlets because I ask.
Very few things in life
are just randomly
given to you
as an adult.
In most cases,
you need to earn it
and or ask for it.
Yet there are many
opportunities currently
available to everyone
if they would muster
the courage and humility
to ask.
The entire crowdfunding
industry is based
on making asks.
Start making bold
and audacious asks.
What's the worst
that could happen?
They say no.
What's the best
that could happen?
When you don't ask,
you lose by default.
And you'll never know
the opportunities
you missed out on.
Don't sell yourself short.
Ask that beautiful girl
on a date.
Ask for that raise
or big opportunity
at work.
Ask people to invest
in your idea.
Put yourself out there.
You'll be blown away
by what happens.
If your goals are logical,
don't expect luck
or the like.
You need to aim beyond
what you are capable of.
You need to develop
a complete disregard
for where your abilities end.
If you think you're unable
to work for the best company
in its sphere,
make that your aim.
If you think you're unable
to be on the cover
of Time magazine,
make it your business
to be there.
Make your vision
of where you want to be
a reality.
Nothing is impossible.
Paul Arden
Most people's goals
are completely logical.
They don't require
much imagination.
They certainly
don't require faith,
luck, magic,
or miracles.
Personally,
I believe it's sad
how skeptical
and secular
many people are becoming.
I find great pleasure
in having faith
in the spiritual.
It provides context
for life
and meaning
for personal growth.
Having faith
allows me to pursue
that which others
would call absurd,
like walking on water
and transcending death.
Truly,
with God,
all things are possible.
There's absolutely
nothing to fear.
Leverage your position.
No matter how small
your wins along the way
are,
leverage your position.
You have a high school diploma?
Leverage your position.
You know a guy
who knows a guy
who knows a guy?
Leverage your position.
You get an article
featured on some
unknown blog?
Leverage your position.
You have $100?
Leverage your position.
Sadly,
most people
can't stop looking
at the other side
of the fence.
They fail to realize
the brilliant possibilities
currently available to them.
This is bad stewardship.
There are people
you already know
who have information
you need.
There are people
you already know
who have capital
you can use.
There are people
you already know
who can connect you
with people
you should know.
Instead of wanting more,
how about you utilize
what you already have?
Until you do,
more won't help you.
Actually,
it will only continue
hurting you
until you learn
to earn something
for yourself.
It's easy to want
other people
to do it for you,
but real success comes
when you take
ownership of your life.
No one else cares
more about your success
than you do.
Your current position
is ripe with
abundant opportunity.
Leverage it.
Once you gain
another inch of position,
leverage it for
all it's worth.
Don't wish for more.
Wish you were better.
And soon enough,
you'll find yourself
in incredible positions
and collaborating
with your heroes.
Success is based
on choice.
Success is based
on having and maintaining
a motivation
worth fighting for.
It's based on believing
what others might
call a fantasy.
It's based on
leveraging your position
and maintaining
the momentum
of every step you take.

How to create
enormous value
in the work you do
You have every advantage
to succeed.
It's easy to talk about
how hard our lives are.
It's easy to talk about
how unfair life is
and that we got
the short end
of the stick.
But does this kind
of talking
really help anyone?
When we judge
our situation
as worse than
someone else's,
we are ignorantly
and incorrectly
saying,
You've got it easy.
You're not like me.
Success should come
easy to you
because you haven't
had to deal
with what I've
gone through.
This paradigm
has formally become
known as the
victim mentality
and it generally
leads to feelings
of entitlement.
The world owes you
nothing.
Life isn't meant
to be fair.
However,
the world has also
given you everything
you need.
The truth is,
you have every advantage
in the world
to succeed
and by believing
this in your bones,
you'll feel an enormous
weight of responsibility
to yourself
and the world.
You've been put
in a perfect position
to succeed.
Everything in the universe
has brought you
to this point
so you can now shine
and change the world.
The world
is your oyster.
Your natural state
is to thrive.
All you have to do
is show up.
Competition is the enemy.
All failed companies
are the same.
They failed
to escape competition.
Peter Thiel
Competition is extremely
costly to maximum
product reach
and wealth creation.
It becomes a battle
of who can slightly
outdo the other
for cheaper and cheaper.
It's a race to the bottom
for all parties involved.
Instead of trying
to compete with other
people or businesses,
it's better to do
something completely novel
or to focus on
a tightly defined niche.
Once you've established
yourself as an authority
over something,
you can set your own terms
rather than reactively
responding to the competition.
Thus, you want to
monopolize the space
in which you create value.
Competing with others
leads people to spend
every day of their lives
pursuing goals
that aren't really
their own,
but what society
has deemed important.
You could spend
your whole life
trying to keep up
but will probably
have a shallow life.
Or, you can define
success for yourself
based on your own values
and detach yourself
from the noise.
If you need permission
to do something,
you probably shouldn't
do it.
My father-in-law
is a highly successful
real estate investor.
Throughout his career,
he's had hundreds of people
ask him if they should
go into real estate.
He tells every one of them
the same thing,
that they shouldn't do it.
In fact,
he actually tries
talking most of them
out of it,
and in most cases,
he succeeds.
Why would he do that?
Those who are going
to succeed
will do so regardless
of what I say,
my father-in-law told me.
I know so many people
who chase whatever
worked for other people.
They never truly decide
what they want to do
and end up jumping
from one thing to the next,
trying to strike quick gold.
And repetitively,
they stop digging
just a few feet
from the gold
after resigning
the spot is barren.
No one will ever
give you permission
to live your dreams.
As Ryan Holiday has said,
in the obstacle is the way,
stop looking for angels
and start looking for angles.
Rather than hoping
for something external
to change your circumstances,
mentally reframe yourself
and your circumstances.
When you change
the way you see things,
the things you see change.
Wayne Dyer,
You are enough.
You can do whatever
you decide to do.
Make the decision
and forget what everyone else
says or thinks about it.
Don't seek praise.
Seek criticism.
As a culture,
we've become so fragile
that we must combine
honest feedback
with 20 compliments.
And when we get feedback,
we do our best
to disprove it.
Psychologists call this
confirmation bias,
the tendency to search for,
interpret,
favor,
and recall information
that confirms
our own beliefs
while giving excessively
less consideration
to alternative possibilities.
It's easy to get praise
when you ask family and friends
who will tell you
exactly what you want to hear.
Instead of seeking praise,
your work will improve
if you seek criticism.
How could this be better?
You will know
your work has merit
when someone cares enough
to give unsolicited critique.
If something is noteworthy,
there will be haters.
As Robin Sharma,
author of
The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari,
has said,
haters confirm greatness.
When you really start showing up,
the haters will be
intimidated by you.
Rather than being a reflection
of what they could do,
you become a reflection
of what they are not doing.
The world gives to the givers
and takes from the takers.
From a scarcity perspective,
helping other people
hurts you because
you no longer have the advantage.
This perspective
sees the world
as a giant pie.
Every piece of the pie you have
is pie I don't have.
So in order for you to win,
I must lose.
From an abundance perspective,
there is not only one pie,
but an infinite number of pies.
If you want more,
you make more.
Thus,
helping others
actually helps you
because it makes the system
as a whole better.
It also builds relationships
and trust and confidence.
I have a friend,
Nate,
who is doing some really
innovative stuff
at the real estate investing
company he works for.
He's using strategies
that no one else is using,
and he's killing it.
He told me he considered
keeping his strategies
a secret
because if other people
knew about them,
they'd use them,
and that'd mean
less leads for him.
But then he did the opposite.
He told everyone
in his company
about what he was doing.
He has even been giving
tons of his leads away.
This has never been seen
before in his company.
But Nate knows
that once this strategy
no longer works,
he can come up
with another one.
And that's what leadership
and innovation
is all about.
And people have come
to trust him.
Actually,
they've come to rely on him
for developing
the best strategies.
Nate makes pies
for himself
and several other people.
And yes,
he is also the top selling
and highest earning
in his company.
It's because he gives the most
and doesn't hoard his ideas,
resources,
or information.
Create something
you wish already existed.
Many entrepreneurs
design products
to scratch their own itch.
Actually,
that's how loads
of problems are solved.
You experience a difficulty
and create a solution.
Musicians and artists
approach their work
the same way.
They create music
they'd want to listen to,
draw paintings
they'd want to see,
and write books
they wish were written.
That's how I personally
approach my work.
I write articles
I myself would want to read.
Your work
should first and foremost
resonate with yourself.
If you don't enjoy
the product of your work,
how can you expect
other people to?
Don't look
for the next opportunity.
The perfect client,
perfect opportunity,
and perfect circumstances
will almost never happen.
Instead of wishing
things were different,
why not cultivate
what's right in front of you?
Rather than waiting
for the next opportunity,
the one in your hands
is the opportunity.
Said another way,
the grass is greener
where you water it.
I see so many people
leave marriages
because they believe
better relationships
are out there.
In most cases,
these people start
new relationships
and end them the same
way the previous
relationship ended.
The problem isn't
your circumstances.
The problem is you.
You don't find
your soulmate.
You create your soulmate
through hard work.
Don't wish it was easier.
Wish you were better.
Don't wish for less problems.
Wish for more skills.
Don't wish for less challenge.
Wish for more wisdom.
Jim Rohn
Don't wait to start.
If you don't purposefully
carve time out every day
to progress and improve,
without question,
your time will get lost
in the vacuum
of our increasingly
crowded lives.
Before you know it,
you'll be old and withered,
wondering where
all that time went.
As Harold Hill has said,
you pile up enough
tomorrows,
and you'll find
you were left with
nothing but a lot
of empty yesterdays.
I waited a few years
too long to actively
start writing.
I was waiting for
the right moment
when I'd have enough time,
money,
and whatever else
I thought I needed.
I was waiting until
I was somehow qualified
or had permission
to do what I wanted
to do.
But you are never
pre-qualified.
There is no degree
for live your dreams.
You qualify yourself
by showing up
and working.
You get permission
by deciding.
Life is short.
Don't wait for tomorrow
for something
you could do today.
Your future self
will either thank you
or shamefully defend you.
Don't publish too early.
At age 22,
Tony Hsieh,
now CEO of Zappos.com,
graduated from Harvard.
When Tony was 23 years old,
six months after
starting Link Exchange,
he was offered
$1 million for the company.
This was amazing to Tony
because less than
a year before,
he was stoked
to get a job at Oracle
making $40,000 per year.
After much thought
and discussion
with his partner,
he rejected the offer,
believing he could
continue to build
Link Exchange
into something bigger.
His true love
is in building
and creating.
A true pro gets paid
but doesn't work
for money.
A true pro
works for love.
Five months later,
Shea was offered
$20 million
from Jerry Yang,
co-founder of Yahoo.
This blew Tony away.
His first thought was,
I'm glad I didn't
sell five months ago.
However,
he held his cool
and asked for a few days
to consider the proposal.
He would make this decision
on his terms.
He thought about
all the things he would do
if he had all that money,
knowing he would never
have to work
another day in his life.
After reflecting,
he could only devise
a small list
of things he wanted.
A condo,
a TV and built-in
home theater,
the ability to go on
weekend mini-vacations
whenever he wanted,
a new computer,
to start another company,
because he loves the idea
of building
and growing something.
That was it.
His passion and motivation
wasn't in having stuff.
He concluded
that he could already
afford a TV,
a new computer,
and could already go
on weekend mini-vacations
whenever he wanted.
He was only 23 years old,
so he determined
a condo could wait.
Why would he sell
LinkExchange
just to build
and grow another company?
A year after Tony
rejected the $20 million
offer,
LinkExchange exploded.
There were over
100 employees.
Business was booming,
yet Shea no longer
enjoyed being there.
The culture and politics
had subtly changed
in the process
of rapid growth.
LinkExchange
was no longer Shea
and a group of close friends
building something
they loved.
They had hired
a bunch of people
in a hurry
who didn't have
the same vision
and motivations they had.
Many of the new employees
didn't care about
LinkExchange
or about building
something they loved.
Rather,
they just wanted
to get rich quick,
purely self-interested.
So he decided
to sell the company
on his terms.
Microsoft purchased
LinkExchange
in 1998
for $265 million
when Shea was
25 years old.
A similar concept
emerged
in a conversation
I recently had
with Jeff Goins,
best-selling author
of The Art of Work.
I asked his advice
about publishing
a book I want
to write
and he said,
wait,
don't jump the gun
on this.
I made that mistake
myself.
If you wait
a year or two,
you'll get a 10 times
bigger advance,
which will change
the trajectory
of your whole career.
Here's how it works.
With 20k email subscribers,
a writer can get around
a 20 to 40k
book advance.
But with 100 to 200k
email subscribers,
a writer can get around
a 150 to 500k
book advance.
Wait a year or two
and change the trajectory
of your career
and life.
This isn't about
procrastination.
It's about strategy.
Timing,
even a few seconds,
could change
your whole life.
If you can't solve
a problem,
it's because you're
playing by the rules.
There is nothing
that is a more
certain sign
of insanity
than to do
the same thing
over and over
and expect the results
to be different.
Albert Einstein
Convention is where
we're at.
Breaking convention
is how we'll evolve,
which requires
a gargantuan quantity
of failure.
If you don't have
the grit to fail
10,000 times,
you'll never invent
your light bulb.
As Seth Godin has said,
if I fail more
than you do,
I win.
Failure is something
to be prized
and praised.
Failure is feedback.
Failure is moving forward.
It's conscious
and exerted effort
towards something
you've never done before.
It's incredible.
The person
who doesn't make mistakes
is unlikely
to make anything.
Paul Arden
Your work
should be a performance.
The cool part
about poetry
is that to most poets,
how their poems
are performed
is just as important,
if not more important,
than what is actually said.
In a similar way,
when you go
to an event
or to hear a speech,
you're usually
going to see the speaker,
not hear
what they have to say.
You already know
what they have to say.
No matter
what type of work
you are in,
it will be better received
if you see it
as an art form.
You are performing
for an audience.
They want you
just as much
as they want your work,
often more.
You get to decide
how it works.
Ryan Holiday,
author of
The Obstacle is the Way,
explains what he calls
the moment,
which every skilled creative
has experienced.
The moment
is when your eyes
are opened
to the mechanics
and behind the scenes
of your craft.
Until you have this moment,
it all seems like magic to you.
You have no idea
how people create
what they create.
After you have this moment,
you realize that
everything is done
by a person intentionally,
creating a particular experience.
I was recently watching
Lord of the Rings
and it dawned on me
that those movies
would be completely different
if they weren't directed
by Peter Jackson.
Completely different.
Every shot,
every set,
the lighting,
the costumes,
how the characters
and landscapes look,
and how the whole film
feels and is portrayed.
It all would have looked
and felt completely different
based on the experience
a different director
was trying to create.
Thus,
there is no right
or wrong way.
Rather,
it's about doing things
your way.
Until you experience
this moment,
you'll continue attempting
the correct or best way
to do things.
You'll continue copying
other people's work.
But if you persist,
you'll become disillusioned
to those who were
once your idols.
They are people
just like you and me.
They've just made a decision
to create in their own way.
The idea of imitation
will become abhorrent,
freeing you
to create as you see fit.
You'll emerge
with your own voice
and original work.
You'll be less troubled
about how your work
is received
and more focused
on creating something
you believe in.
The music you listen to
determines your success
in life.
Without music,
life would be a mistake.
Friedrich Nietzsche
One study found
that the type of music
you listen to
affects how you
perceive neutral faces.
If you listen to sad music,
you're more likely
to interpret people
being sad.
By listening to positive music,
you're more likely
to see happy faces,
which will influence
how you interact
with people.
Listening to moderate
noise level
makes our mental processing
slightly more difficult,
which leads us
to utilize more creative
methods of problem solving.
When that music
is ambient,
we can delve deeper
into the wellsprings
of neural creativity.
Other research found
that your music preference
reflects your personality type.
For example,
they found that
classical music fans
tend to have
high self-esteem,
are creative,
introvert,
and at ease.
And that chart pop fans
tend to have
high self-esteem,
are hardworking,
outgoing,
and gentle,
but are not creative
and not at ease.
Science highlights
the fact that
in some cases,
silence is not golden.
For instance,
listening to classical music
enhanced the visual attention
of stroke patients,
while listening to nothing
at all worsened attention.
Other research found
that cyclists
who listened to music
required 7% less oxygen
than those listening
to nothing.
Indeed,
music can literally
change our entire energy,
emotion,
and motivation
in an instant.
It's a powerful
and beautiful tool.
You can also use music
as a trigger
for optimal performance.
For example,
Michael Phelps
had a routine
he did religiously
before each swimming event
involving music.
He's not alone.
Many athletes
use music before events
to trigger relaxation
from the pressure
and even to psych themselves up.
When asked by Time magazine
about his use of music
prior to races,
Phelps said it kept him focused
and helped him
tune everything out
and take one step
at a time.
When asked about
the kind of music
he listens to,
he answered,
I listen to hip-hop and rap.
Interestingly,
research has found
that high-tempo music
like hip-hop
can create strong arousal
and performance readiness.
Other evidence finds
the intensity
of the emotional response
can linger long
after the music has stopped.
So while Phelps
is in the water swimming,
he's still hyped
from his hip-hop.
Lastly,
research has found
that the types of music
we listen to
impact our level
of spirituality.
This last point
is particularly important to me.
Spirituality heavily
influences everything I do,
from how I interact
with my family
to what and how I write
to how I develop
and pursue my goals.
In order to be
spiritually aware,
I've stopped listening
to music with negative
tones and lyrics.
I usually listen
to classical new wave stuff
like Enya
and ambient electrical stuff
like Ryan Farish.
I also have some
electro dubstep stuff
that gets my creativity flowing.
The following songs
are ones I've listened to
on repeat while writing.
Club Soda
by Ghostland Observatory.
Echoes by Digitalism.
Da Hype by Junior Jack.
This cover of Ellie Goulding
is also highly repeatable.
Fragile by Daft Punk.
Rain by Black Mill.
The Morning Room by Helios.
Dive by Tycho,
Whole Album.
More on the ambient electro side.
Anything Tycho is good.
Lick It by Cascade and Skrillex.
Icy E-Mix.
Ambient electro.
Discipleship by Teen Days.
Most of Teen Days is good.
Also really love Morning House.
Modern Driveway by Luke Abbott.
Zoinks by Session Victim.
Hopefully something in there
is enjoyable
and just distracting enough
to blow up
your creativity bubbles.

Self-acceptance
is the counterintuitive way
to become the best version
of yourself.
Jeremy Piven,
the actor famous for his roles
in Entourage
and Mr. Selfridge,
was recently interviewed
by Success Magazine.
In the interview,
he mentioned that
as an actor,
the only way to get work
is to audition
for specific roles.
There's just no way around
that tried and true ritual.
The challenge for most actors
and actresses?
They get in their own way.
It doesn't matter
how much homework
they've done for the audition.
It doesn't matter
how talented they are.
If they are so set
on getting a part,
they fail at one
of the key aspects
of auditioning,
being present,
which is the essence
of flow.
Thus,
they come across
as desperate
and scattered,
and it manifests
in lackluster performances
before an auditioning committee.
It was only
when Piven quit worrying
about the outcome
that he was able
to audition successfully.
He came across
more natural
and spontaneous.
He quit trying to be
what he thought
others wanted him to be
and instead
allowed his art
to be a gift
without attached contingencies.
If he didn't get the gig,
either they didn't get it
or it just wasn't
the right fit.
He could then move on
to the next audition
without overanalyzing
his performance.
This shift in approach
and motivation
allowed him to get
the jobs he always wanted.
Piven is not alone.
For the first six seasons
of American Ninja Warrior,
not a single person
completed all of the stages.
However,
Isaac Caldiero
recently became
the first American Ninja Warrior.
In previous years,
Caldiero said
he put too much pressure
on himself to succeed.
However,
this year,
he just wanted to have fun
and see what happened.
In a similar vein,
trying to create
a particular outcome
while showing affection
to loved ones
can pull you
from the now
and come off
as inauthentic.
People can sense
phoniness,
especially when it comes
to love.
As Leo Buscaglia,
world-renowned researcher
and speaker on love,
has said,
Love is always bestowed
as a gift,
freely,
willingly,
and without expectation.
We don't love
to be loved.
We love
to love.
It's so easy
to forget
that the work we do,
although enjoyable to us,
isn't completely
about us.
Our work
is for and about
the people
we are providing it for.
As Seth Godin has said,
a generous gift
comes with no transaction
foreseen
or anticipated.
Yet Godin continues,
In most families,
even the holidays
are more about
present exchange
than the selfless act
of actually giving a gift.
So how do we live
our lives
without obsessing
over a specific outcome?
How do we live
authentically
and allow life
to unfold organically?
And how do we let
love
rather than reward
be our primary motivation
for everything we do?
Focus on your behavior
and not the outcome.
People often say,
If you want to be happier,
lower your expectations.
Recent research
supports this notion.
I've always had trouble
with this idea.
It always seemed to me
to justify
permanent mediocrity.
I don't think
Jeremy Piven
has low expectations
for his acting,
nor do I believe
Isaac Caldero
expects to fail.
Although low expectations
may be related
to happiness,
they are also related
to low performance.
Conversely,
high expectations
increase performance.
Both of these expectations
form what appears
to be
a self-fulfilling prophecy.
So how do we wrap
our brain
around these
contradictory suggestions?
Do we forget
the outcome
or do we set
high goals
for ourselves?
Research has found
that expectations
in one's own ability
serves as a better
predictor
of high performance
than expectations
about a specific outcome.
In his book
The Personal MBA,
Josh Kaufman explains
that when setting goals,
your locus of control
should target
what you can control,
i.e. your efforts,
instead of results
you can't control,
e.g. whether
you get the part.
Expect optimal performance
from yourself
and let the chips
fall where they may.
The organic output
will be your highest
quality work,
which is the true reward.
Put most simply,
do what is right,
let the consequence follow.
Move beyond self-esteem
Care about what
other people think
and you will always
be their prisoner.
Lao Tzu
When people try
expressing their creativity,
their self-esteem
is often a reflection
of the outcome
of their work.
Was it good?
we ask ourselves.
If it's not,
we get down on ourselves.
This is the essence
of self-esteem,
our subjective evaluation
of our own worth.
It is highly ego-focused
and an unhealthy
rollercoaster experience.
Thus,
when we experience
difficulty or failure,
our self-esteem plummets.
When we succeed,
it skyrockets.
In this way,
our emphasis
on our self-esteem
radically hinders
our ability
to achieve flow.
The idea
that self-esteem
is important
has become
a dogmatic assumption
by people
in Western
and highly individualized
cultures.
But Roy Baumeister,
one of the world's
most prominent psychologists,
argues self-esteem
causes more problems
than it solves
and a waste of time
in the pursuit
of health and well-being,
Baumeister argues.
Rather than obsessing
about how you feel
about yourself,
you can move
beyond self-esteem
into a state
of self-acceptance.
To accept yourself
unconditionally
means to accept yourself
even if no achievements
or approvals are met.
There is no rating
of the self.
According to
psychological research,
not accepting yourself
can result in embarrassment,
feelings of inadequacy,
anxiety,
and depression.
None of these feelings
are helpful
to achieving flow.
Some may argue
that self-acceptance
means you're okay
with mediocrity.
On the contrary,
you can accept
who you are
while still striving
for more.
And that's
the entire point.
Self-acceptance
allows you
to actually embrace
where you are
on the path.
You live in the moment
because come what may,
you are enough
and you have enough.
You are blessed
beyond measure.
Be grateful
for what is.
Self-acceptance
and gratitude
are similar concepts.
Gratitude
is the appreciation
and acceptance
of what is,
whereas ingratitude
is an underappreciation
of what is
and a longing
for what's perceived
to be missing.
Having a deep
sense of gratitude
not only allows you
to live in the moment,
but can actually
intensify
and enhance the moment.
For example,
Dr. Robert Emmons
explains that
connecting more deeply
with your body
by seeing it
as a brilliant gift
can help you
be more present
as you touch,
see,
smell,
taste,
and hear,
evoking enhanced
consciousness
and sensation.
For me,
I use prayer,
meditation,
and journal writing
to deepen my gratitude
and live more presently.
Having done this
consistently
for several years now,
I've learned to see
everything in my life
as a gift.
Every moment is gold.
From this space,
I can enjoy the moment
for what it is
without respect
for what it might become.
Thus,
flow becomes natural
and easy.
Conclusion
Flow is an optimal
conscious state
where you feel
and perform
at your highest level.
You become
completely absorbed
in what you're doing,
pure presence.
Everything else
in the world
falls away
into utter insignificance
as your sense of self
dissolves
into a higher realm
of connection.
Every action you perform
flows seamlessly
into the next.
You live 100% unscripted
and in the moment.
To make flow
a regular
and fluid experience
in your life,
let go of your attachments
to specific outcomes.
This does not mean
you don't have goals
or ambitions.
Rather,
these ambitions
don't define you.
And more importantly,
they don't consume your mind
while you perform.
Flow is also facilitated
by accepting fully
who you are
and the work
you feel inspired to do.
Hold nothing back.
Be bold and vulnerable.
Take risks.
Trust in your higher power
with whom you are
fully connected.
Lastly,
embrace gratitude
by living fully.
Feel and connect
to the moment.
This moment is priceless.
Don't waste it
by wishing it was
something else.
It is a gift.
It is your moment.
