this is the active podcast we provide short segments and outtakes taken from the active
inference lab weekly live streams if you like what you hear in this podcast and you want more
of this material check out the entire live stream at the active inference lab youtube channel
the link to the live stream is provided in the episode description my name is blue knight and
this week we're going to continue discussing a variational approach to scripts daniel friedman
is facilitating our discussion and this episode is a light warm-up synthesizing everything that
we've learned about scripts so far so one question since many of you were here last week is what is
something that you thought about differently after our conversation last week and so while people are
raising their hand um i just really like this way of thinking about scripts and genres for our
encounters and at the life trajectory level and at the sort of sub scene level what genre are we
drawing our scripts from rj my name is rj corday uh i'm in new york and i'm currently researching
organizational dynamics intelligence analysis and narrative warfare uh so after last week's
conversation uh what i ended up really thinking about is what happens when we lose our scripts
so it seems like scripts are are um a framework for representing like like how we how we move through
these complex social interactions um so what happens when say like in the spanish inquisition where it was
a process by which they were actively trying to remove scripts that people had um what happens in the
absence of them uh when we tear them away so that that's that's i've been thinking about that a lot
last week interesting question blue i've been thinking really a lot about um like the transparency
of active inference versus like other types of like deep learning and how they're kind of a black box and
really what rj uh had said last week about how active inference is more like a blanket of black boxes
i thought that that was pretty cool and i've been like kind of you know twirling that around in my
head for for the last week cool and it's almost like um if the sentence oh go ahead sasha
hi my name is sasha i'm also in california um uh kind of the opposite of rj over the last week i've
been thinking uh what's not a script um and can there be an absence of a script because um we're
we're just as apt to follow another set of directions as we are um the cultural set of
directions that we get for interactions so um that's been kind of uh vexing because it's similar
to the problem with um thinking about free energy and active inference that once you see it then you
wonder like what's not in that category and um how do we kind of draw the correct boundaries around
uh the definitions of these terms because yeah once you see scripts you really see it around
around you in every situation yeah to your point there sasha it's like if a first time ever social
experience or a very ritualized one if the scripts concept can include both of those as well as the
internalist and externalist concept it's kind of like how many grains of sand in a heap like how
reproducible or how strong does the pattern of a social encounter have to be before we're going to
deem it script of a certain kind blue so to kind of to piggyback on what you and sasha was saying like
i've been thinking about like is maybe everything is a script like is a chair a script really like i mean
a chair has like a set role and like a thing we do with it or it can you know take on a new like
script so like what what about all of these like objects in our everyday society really like once you
once you see a script like what is not a script like i i have a hard time like you know unfolding that
well it's like the wood is chairing you know the chair is a noun but it's a it's a process and it was
built and it will eventually not be a chair and so while it's chairing we can draw a blanket you know put a
seat cover on it and use it in the functional interface of being a chair and so especially
when things become um sufficiently compartmentalizable or interfaceable so that they have a functional way
of dealing with them instead of just getting lost in the becoming and unbecoming of chairs
we can start to think all right well yes that is happening but also there's this stable pattern
that i can sit on that's why we're calling it a chair and so it's like this emergence of
reproducible function and pattern out of continual becoming and unbecoming and so that is to the
point with a lot of discussions about the markov blanket or the priston blanket whatever it ends up
being in these questions about ergodicity as well like does everything by virtue of having inputs and
outputs is everything going to be under this umbrella or is this kind of umbrella only going to be over
things that have um input output relationships of some type over some spatial or temporal scale steven
hi i'm steven i'm in toronto and uh i think this also made me think about where sense making comes in
um and how this approach to scripts it kind of it helps extend the active inference work with deontic cues
you know they talk about the traffic lights and a lot of other things in the models and this starts to
extend these sort of top down cues um into narratives and stuff like that but there's still
the the more existential kind of participatory sense making and the kind of existential sense making
processes which are maybe um they're still open to sort of somehow integrate with this more scripted
kind of way of making sense of the world so i think that's that's something that i'm interested in in
where do they start to sort of mesh or override each other in different ways cool all right let's go to
the next warm-up question how could a different idea of scripts relate to how we regulate the behavior of
ourselves and others so depending on how somebody thinks about scripts how might they be likely to
treat their own behavior differently and how might they be likely or willing to engage in different
kinds of regulations of other people's behavior so let's just say that there's some prop in a script
so something like a artifact or an object so just like to rj's example about wanting to uproot a script
so then you could say well you can't use this symbol or you can't use this combination of words
or we're not allowing anything from this genre of script and we're gonna know it because it's gonna
have this style and um so depending on how we formalize these scripts maybe in order to regulate
other people's deployment of scripts we might take very specific um sub components like a certain set
of words or an artifact and then say well this is or isn't ruled in rj uh yeah so so on this um uh one
one thing uh going going back to the last question just what you kind of uh uh stole the words out of
my mouth what i wanted to say which was is a uh uh is a chair a script for wood um but uh i i also want
to note like on this is i i got to have a conversation yesterday with eric sap from public
democracy and a lot of the stuff they've been doing uh as i mentioned to you before dan is like um using
like traditionally what would be used for for advertising uh for for for like public good so
what they've done in one case was was be able to uh use the same tools that they would use to target
advertising to um uh target recent people who have very recently picked up a heroin addiction
um looking at their their behaviors online be able to figure out that that they're that they've
recently picked up this addiction or that they were very likely had and then give them on rants
toward treatment at the time when they are most likely um uh able to to move toward accepting those
types of treatments they're not they're not very deep into the addiction yet so um i brought up scripts
to him uh and we we talked a little bit about it and it seems like their look at it it's like yeah
it's it's almost like one if if you can give people the idea um that um they're using these scripts and
that they can change them and that they're creating them in real time uh or or adapting to them in real
time then um you kind of have the self-awareness that can kind of help you um uh moving down like
toward we talked about radicalization last week like if you're aware of of of the scripts that are in
the space maybe you can you can be self-aware when you're using them uh so i think that's one
thing and then um in addition like recognizing when you're about to hit a threshold where you're
about to like start using a script rather than just some behavior which kind of ties to what sasha
was saying is like at what point do we call something a script so i'm i'm not sure but but
anyway yep um it reminds me of the gateway idea like gateway drug or gateway website or gateway meme
whatever it is it's like using that metaphor it's like whoa if you go through the gateway if
you pass through you're not coming back it's all downhill from there well that's one script it's a
narrative for how you could proceed through different types of experiences but could there be
a sort of like visitation metaphor it's like hey you're gonna visit this landia and then your
family's still going to be waiting for you and they all want you to become uh safe and come home
for example and then that could be a tractor that takes some of the same setup it's a similar genre
at least in the beginning of the movie but then it goes a different way and so that definitely is a
is a nice point there we hope you enjoyed this week's episode stay tuned for next time when we're
going to talk about scripts relationships and active inference
