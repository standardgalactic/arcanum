Welcome. Two lectures back, we looked at the revolutions of agriculture and iron in Africa.
One way of defining a revolution might be to say that it changes the scope of possibility.
It changes the range of potential.
And one way of assessing the outer limits of the range of possibility is to look at an extreme case.
To ask just how far could the changes go?
This brings us to ancient Egypt.
There's nothing quite like ancient Egypt.
The subject certainly could be the focus of an entire teaching company course, and lo and behold, it is.
That will be the last commercial I do for another course, but it's a good one.
Now, although Egypt lies outside of our course's self-assigned area of coverage, that is sub-Saharan Africa,
Egypt's history, and really even more relevant, I think, today, the greatly varying approaches to Egypt's history
have played such vivid roles in interpretations, in controversies about world history and about African history
that we simply cannot ignore it.
So this will be one of our discursions beyond sub-Saharan Africa.
For nearly 3,000 years, the lower Nile Valley in Egypt,
despite numerous dynastic changes, something like 30 different dynasties,
despite the fact that people talk about the Old Kingdom, the Middle Kingdom, the New Kingdom,
for something like 3,000 years, ancient Egypt demonstrated, displayed,
an essential, a basic political and cultural continuity.
That's rather incredible.
If you compare that longevity with Rome, or the longevity of the age of the American nation, for instance,
it dwarves it.
Egypt's achievements in art, literature, science, perhaps above all in architecture,
continue to astound us.
Now, the ultimate basis, however, of the Egyptian wonder
was an incredible leap in agricultural productivity along the Nile.
The key to that, of course, was the annual flood of the Nile.
Atop the rich deposits of silt,
comparatively limited amounts of labor
could yield previously unthinkable amounts of agricultural wealth.
The people who produced that wealth
were peasant farmers.
In this course, I will simply use the term peasant
to refer to small-scale farmers.
You know, we pay so much attention
to the spectacular things coming out of Egypt,
the splendors of it, and understandably so,
usually associated with the elites,
if not the pharaohs, at least the thinkers,
the mathematicians, the architects,
the creators of these wonders,
that we perhaps are in some danger of overlooking
the people who, almost literally, in this sense,
were at the base of the pyramid,
in this case, the social pyramid.
Peasant farmers produced this enormous agricultural wealth.
They were poor, obviously not because they weren't producing much,
but because the surplus which they produced
was, of course, regularly siphoned upwards
through taxation.
And here again, the particular characteristics
of a river and environment made a difference.
The Nile River Valley, the populated portions
of the Nile River Valley,
of course, comparatively, actually quite by any standard,
very narrow.
It also is a river which is quite navigable,
upstream and down.
Prevailing winds blow upstream,
so you can take those to move up.
The river flow, on the other hand,
of course, obviously is downstream.
Now, the narrowness of that valley
and the navigability of the river
meant that it was possible
for the pharaoh's agents,
the scribes and the tax collectors,
to reach these producers,
these peasant producers,
on a very regular basis.
In fact, I'm sure,
to many peasants,
it was an overly regular basis.
After all,
every phase of the agricultural cycle
was, in a sense,
regulated or monitored,
perhaps is the better word,
by these agents,
the bureaucrats, basically,
of the Egyptian state.
Quotas, in essence,
were set for peasant producers
based on the size
or the scale
of the annual Egyptian flood.
And therefore,
producers were assigned
a particular level of surplus
which they were expected to produce.
and the consequences
of not producing it
were usually,
at the very least,
corporal punishment.
So, the siphoning of this
and the geographical factors
which made it possible
to siphon this surplus
is ultimately what underlay
these grand projects
which we still find
so captivating.
Now, perhaps surprisingly,
Egypt, in its heyday,
did not, in fact,
employ iron tools
but it certainly
had metallurgy.
It made extensive use
or people made extensive use
of copper
and eventually bronze tools.
Bronze is an alloy
of copper and tin.
And its expertise
in metallurgy
is shown also,
of course,
in the legendary
Egyptian gold.
Such was Egypt's prosperity
and the resultant
population increase
that it is possible
that at the kingdom's height
half of all people
living in Africa
resided here.
Half the people
on the continent
may have been
part of ancient Egypt
at its height.
Now, the idea of civilization
and related questions
of the origin
of civilization
have embroiled Egypt
in controversy
for a very long time
precisely because
it seems to embody
so much of the very concept
of civilization.
I'm going to take
a slight personal
digression here.
I rarely use
the term
civilization.
I'm not terribly
comfortable
with it.
To me,
it's a word
that is so laden
with the possibilities
of misunderstanding
and frankly,
one often loaded
with what could only
be called
bias
that I often
find it
unuseful.
I think that
all too often
the dichotomy
between
civilization
versus
barbarism
or civilization
versus
savagery
is equated
with
a dichotomy
essentially
between
us
and them.
Who are the
civilized?
Well, obviously
we are.
What are they like?
Well, obviously
they are uncivilized.
They are barbaric
and what have you.
Now, I want to
quickly add here
that this is not
simply, you know,
some sort of
politically correct
attack on
the western world
although I think
what I just mentioned
has a history there.
I don't think I have
to go into
great depth
to suggest
that there are
certainly people
in the world today
who see themselves
as the repository
of civilization
and see
the western world
as the repository
of savagery.
So, it's not
exclusive to
one place
or one time
one culture
this us-them
civilized
versus uncivilized
kind of dichotomy.
just to extend
that problem
I have with it
a little bit further
suppose we extended
the term
civilization
just a bit
and talked about
civilized behavior
for instance.
Take a country
in Europe
Germany
and again
this is not an effort
to pick on
any particular place.
Germany has been
the home
of people
like Bach
Goethe
Einstein
creators of
fantastic
achievements
in culture
and science
and literature
products
many would say
of the highest
of civilizations.
Germany
of course
also produced
Adolf Hitler
it produced
the Holocaust
where does that
leave us
in terms of
the relationship
or analysis
of the relationship
between civilization
and civilized behavior?
Again
I'll
take it a bit
further personally
most
I've spent
more time
in one particular
part of Africa
than any other
and that's the area
of southern Zambia
dominated by
Tonga peoples
Tonga speaking peoples.
Now
the Tonga
historically
did not
build pyramids
they did not
have literacy
and yet
in terms of
my own experiences
I've certainly
encountered
a wealth
and abundance
of behavior
I can only
call civilized
from that
kind of culture
from those
people.
Okay
enough
from my
personal digression
there may be
ways to take
some of the
you know
some of the
emotions
some of that
that tilt
one way or the
other out of a
concept of civilization
if we go to a
source like
you know
the encyclopedia
of the social
sciences
and look up
civilization
we'll get
something that
is a much
I think
more useful
kind of
objective set
of criteria
that they are
using
to
define
the
very concept.
In its most
literal sense
civilization
for instance
refers to
the presence
of cities.
Do we have
urban life?
Do people
live
were cities
of some
size
emergent?
Did they
develop there?
Literacy
obviously
a characteristic
that many
would point
to
in a more
as I say
objective sense
or way
of defining
civilization
and some
may go on
to that
monumental
architecture
may figure
as a
criterion
for civilization
or an
extensive
and elaborate
division
of labor
some would
say.
I think
we ought
to back
up though
maybe
and just
mention
that the
prerequisite
for urban
life is
of course
agricultural
life.
Without
the agricultural
production
to feed
cities
civilization
in this
sense
is
impossible.
Now
was Egypt
the fount
of
western
civilization?
Was
Greece
possible
without
Egypt?
Was
Greece
fundamentally
different
from
Egypt?
Was
Greece
that some
would have
it
a copy
of
Egypt?
I must
say that
in entering
this
question
of the
relationship
between
ancient
Greece
and
ancient
Egypt
we are
entering
a bit
of a
minefield
here
and I
think
within a
few
minutes
you may
see
why.
Now
over
the
long
course
of
time
the
pendulum
in
the
western
world
has
certainly
swung
back
and
forth
a
number
of
times
in
terms
of
this
relationship
between
Egypt
and
Greece
and
when I
say
it
has
gone
from
contentions
that
Egypt
was
extraordinarily
important
as
an
influence
on
Greece
or
in
the
extreme
case
that
Greece
simply
amounted
to
an
echo
or a
copy
of it
to
contentions
that
Greece
was
something
fundamentally
different
and that
in fact
western
civilization
needs to be
traced back
to there
and stop
there.
That's
something
fundamentally
different
was represented
across the
Mediterranean
in ancient
Egypt.
Now
the pendulum
has swung
not only
over time
this
division
if you like
of approaches
to
Egypt's
role
in the
long
run
of
western
civilization
certainly
continues
today.
Consider
a couple
of
fairly
recent
publications.
Martin
Bernal's
multi-volume
work
entitled
Black
Athena
very
provocative
title
there
and as
you might
expect
he is
arguing
at some
length
and with
some
subtlety
that in
fact the
roots of
classical
Greek
civilization
were to
be found
in
Africa
and in
Asia.
Another
book by
Mary
Lefkowitz
largely
created or
assembled in
response to
Bernal and
others has
an equally
provocative
title.
It says
Not Out
of Africa
is the
title of
the book
so stressing
that in
fact the
course of
so-called
western
civilization
is something
quite
fundamentally
different
and that
Egypt
owed
relatively
little
excuse me
that Greece
owed relatively
little
to Egypt.
Now those
who would
support
Bernal's
position
that
Egypt
did owe
a great
deal to
excuse me
that Greece
did owe
a great
deal to
Egypt
do have
some
contemporary
by which
I mean
ancient
sources
that they
can turn
to
and one
of them
is
usually
considered
the father
of history
again in
the western
tradition
and that
is Herodotus
who not
only wrote
a great
deal of
history
about the
whole
ancient
world
but spent
some time
in Egypt
in about
450
BC
I just
quote him
for a
moment
here on
Herodotus
on
religion
he wrote
that the
names of
nearly all
the gods
came to
Greece
from Egypt
these
practices
and he's
referring to
religious
practices
then
and others
I will
speak of
later
were borrowed
by the
Greeks
from Egypt
now
here
is where
the modern
obsession
with
race
enters the
arena
a century
ago
prominent
American
scholars
went to
Egypt
they examined
Egyptian
crania
that is
skulls
and they
pronounced
that these
were
Caucasian
that they
were white
in other
words
in other
words
they were
making the
case
that
Egypt
the
fount
of
western
civilization
almost
by definition
therefore
was white
and now
we've
proved
it
in
1926
a
major
Egyptologist
published
a book
in which
he stated
flatly
that
the Egyptians
were part
of
his term
the great
white race
now
in more
recent decades
as you might
expect
a counter
argument
has
definitely
emerged
and it
goes something
like this
that Egypt
was not
just
African
it was
black
African
this has
become a
central
tenet
of some
strains
not all
of what
in the
last couple
of decades
has been
called
Afro
centrism
or Afro
centrism
one of the
founders
in a sense
although he
never called
himself that
of the
entire
approach
to Egypt
that that
represents
was the
Senegalese
scholar
from West
Africa
Sheikh
Ante
Diop
I'll
just give
you one
sentence
from him
or a
couple
of sentences
actually
that states
his conclusion
he published
a book
by the way
in the
late
1950s
called
The
African
Origin
of
Civilization
Myth
or
Reality
As you
can no
doubt
deduce
he certainly
answered that
it was
reality
The ancient
Egyptians
were Negroes
The moral
fruit of
their
civilization
is to be
counted among
the assets
of the
black world
Now you can
see from
that that
Jop and
his followers
not only
ascribe an
enormous influence
from Egypt
towards Greece
but an
enormous influence
from Egypt
towards the
rest of
Africa
in a sense
that the
ancient Nile
Valley
in Egypt
bears the
same
relationship
to African
civilization
as Greece
and Rome
would to
Western
civilization
So let
me try
to navigate
this
minefield
a bit
My own
view starts
with what I
might
presumptuously
call
some common
sense
It's important
to distinguish
between modern
Egypt and
ancient
Egypt
Today
Egypt
is seen
property
seen
as a
central
part
some
would say
the
central
part
of the
Arab
world
But the
full-scale
Arab
invasions
and permanent
occupations
of Egypt
did not
begin until
after the
Prophet Muhammad's
death in the
7th century
AD
This is a
thousand years
after
ancient Egypt's
fall
In general
people's skin
color
closer to the
equator
was darker
and farther
from it
lighter
This might
suggest that
Egypt's
original
population
was on
average
somewhere
between
the averages
in
central
Africa
and
central
Europe
Maybe
a phrase
like
people of
color
is more
useful
than
black
versus
white
Egypt
was at
a crossroads
of Africa
the Mediterranean
and
southwest
Asia
It is
reasonable
to expect
that peoples
of various
origins
live there
and indeed
the representations
out of
Egypt
and by that
I mean
the paintings
drawings
the sculptures
etc.
appear to
represent
a great
range
a great
variety
of what
modern
people
would call
races
Now
maybe most
important of
all
there's good
evidence
that people
in ancient
Egypt
did not
think
of racial
categories
in the way
that modern
peoples
have
that
conceptions
of
blackness
or whiteness
or of
the black
race
or white
race
were simply
not part
of their
lexicon
We run
therefore
the constant
risk of
imposing
classifications
on peoples
who didn't
necessarily see
things that
way
at all
I find
myself
in agreement
with
Eric
Gilbert
and
Jonathan
Reynolds
authors
of
another
recent
textbook
who
I'm
paraphrasing
but
they
say that
essentially
asking the
question
who were
the ancient
Egyptians
which I
would
amend
to say
asking
the
question
what
color
were the
ancient
Egyptians
reveals
more
about
ourselves
than the
answer
reveals
about
the
Egyptians
I'll
end this
section
by saying
that
Egypt
is
indisputably
part
of the
African
continent
that
does
not
require
divorcing
it
from the
Mediterranean
world
or the
world
of the
Near
East
these
are not
either
or
categories
they're
not
either
or
issues
Egypt
can
be
both
and
both
part
of the
African
world
and
part
of the
Mediterranean
world
as it
is part
of the
Arab
world
ok
now
to seek
a firmer
link
between
Egypt
and the
rest
of Africa
let's
look
upstream
let's
look
south
on the
Nile
river
let's
extend
our
Nile
purview
beyond
pharaonic
ancient
Egypt
and let's
move
into the
area
historically
known
as
Nubia
it's
now
the
northern
most
parts
of the
modern
country
of
Sudan
I'm
going to
turn
first
to the
findings
of
the
archaeologists
from the
University of
Chicago
led by
Bruce
Williams
who carried
out
certainly
the most
extensive
researches
in and
about
ancient
Nubia
that we
have seen
and began
to publish
these in
the late
1980s
years
now
what they
found
I'm going
to go
particularly
to their
very
earliest
findings
or I
should say
the findings
from the
very earliest
period that
they
surveyed
which ran
from
3800 BC
to
3100 BC
now I
mentioned
those dates
this is a
case where
chronology may
indeed really
make a
difference
here
3800 BC
leading up
to
3100 BC
3100 BC
is used
the conventional
date for
the start
of the
founding
of
the ancient
Egyptian
dynasties
now what
Williams and
his teams
found
they have
argued in
numerous
publications
through the
excavation
and exploration
for instance
of royal
tombs and
cemeteries
is what
in his
phrase
he calls
a lost
kingdom
called
Tasseti
or land
of the bow
again
well
upstream
of
ancient
Egypt
and
perhaps
most
important
of all
predating
it
Williams
argues
that
ideas
like
divine
kingship
in other
words
may
have
originated
further
into
Africa
than
previously
believed
and that
therefore
the movement
of ideas
like
divine
kingship
the notion
of the
state
building
impulse
if you
like
moved
from
the
south
and
into
Egypt
from
that
direction
now
as you
might
imagine
this
also
remains
controversial
as it
happens
after
3100
BC
as
Egypt
is
rising
these
very
areas
of
Nubia
that
Williams
was
excavating
fell
into
some
decline
still
there was
a revival
about
2000
BC
that
is
about
4,000
years
ago
a
major
kingdom
centered
at
Kerma
on
the
Nile
emerged
in
Nubia
Cush
as this
and its
successor
states
came to
be called
was
the
second
oldest
state
at least
in
Africa
if
Williams
is right
perhaps
the
third
oldest
state
in
all
of
Africa
over
a
period
of
2000
years
or
so
then
relations
between
Kush
and
Egypt
economic
relations
political
relations
cultural
relations
were
substantial
and they
were
complex
there
were
several
swings
of the
power
pendulum
Egypt
occupied
Kush
at
times
but
around
750
BC
the
Nubians
from
Kush
invaded
Egypt
and ruled
it
for nearly
a century
this is
the 25th
of the
30 or so
dynasties
in the
Egyptian
progression
and it's
usually called
the Nubian
dynasty
of
Egypt
in
some
ways
the
Kushites
showed
considerable
Egyptian
influence
they built
pyramids
for instance
they're not
on
quite the
size
of
the
Egyptian
ones
but
they're
most
impressive
nonetheless
their
kings
referred
to
themselves
as
pharaohs
their
religion
in a lot
of respects
was very
similar
and some
of the
named
deities
like
Amun
and so
forth
show up
in
the
Kushite
history
as well
in
other
respects
on
the
other
hand
Kush
was
quite
independent
it
developed
its own
alphabetic
script
and
this
script
is
actually
still
undeciphered
extremely
complex
script
which
differed
fundamentally
from
Egyptian
hieroglyphics
now
in the
centuries
leading up
to
the
modern
era
the birth
of Jesus
up to
1 AD
in the
early
centuries
BC
the capital
of
Kush
shifted
to the
south
within
Nubia
Nubia
and
came to
be
located
at
the
city
of
Meroway
between
the
Nile
and
the
Atbara
rivers
at the
junction
of
those
two
rivers
and
it's
here
that
we
do
find
one
of
our
old
revolutions
Meroway
became
an
iron
production
site
of the
first
importance
in
tracing
the
history
of iron
and
iron
working
throughout
Africa
one
scholar
called
it
the
Birmingham
of
central
Africa
given
Meroway's
very
wide
trading
contacts
it's
reasonable
to view
it
as an
important
center
for
iron
knowledge
diffusion
now
eventually
Meroway
appears
to have
declined
for instance
in the
production
of its
iron
partly
because
the
rather
limited
woodland
around
this
area
which
after
all
is
nearby
contingent
or
next
door
to
the
portions
of
the
Sahara
the
woodland
was
exhausted
and
the
woodland
was
particularly
important
in
creating
the
charcoal
which
produced
the
heat
which
allowed
the
smelting
of
iron
to
take
place
its
final
fall
though
actually
came
at
the
hands
of
Ethiopia
known
as
axum
then
when
King
Izana
conquered
it
and
spelled
an
end
to
Meroe's
old
iron
industry
we will
meet
King
Izana
again
in our
lecture
on
Ethiopia
a couple
of steps
down
the road
through
Cush
then
we find
a credible
link
between
ancient
Egypt
and
Africa
to
the
south
Cush
and
Egypt
influenced
one
another
Egypt
influencing
Cush
Cush
influencing
Egypt
Egypt
influenced
Cush
and Cush
in turn
had
effects
through
its
trading
links
with
Africa
to
the
south
in
essence
the
prosperity
of
old
Meroe
old
Cush
was
based
on
its
middleman
position
it
was
able
to
take
advantage
of
the
commerce
from
inner
Africa
to
the
south
and
the
Mediterranean
world
to
its
north
we
will
see
rather
quickly
other
so-called
middleman
trading
kingdoms
when we
look
in
lecture
10
at
the
rise
of
the
old
savannah
states
of
West
Africa
I'll
end
this
consideration
of
Egypt
and
Cush
by
quoting
the
eminent
historian
Roland
Oliver
of
the
University
of
London
on
Cush
who
concluded
that
it
was
indeed

the
prototype
of
the
later
states
of
the
sub

thank
you
