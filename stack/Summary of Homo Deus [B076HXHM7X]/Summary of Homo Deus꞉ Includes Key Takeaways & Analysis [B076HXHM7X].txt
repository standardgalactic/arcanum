Summary of Homo Deus
Includes Key Takeaways and Analysis
Written by Fast Reads
Narrated by Lisa Negron
Executive Summary
In his book, Yuval Noah Harari
hypothesizes a technocratic dystopian future
in which the religion of data
dominates the universe
and renders humans obsolete
and possibly extinct.
Homo Deus begins by presenting
the chief problem of the 21st century.
Now that humans have mostly resolved
the problems of famine, war, and plague,
which projects will humankind prioritize?
Harari argues the quest for immortality,
happiness, and divinity will follow.
To support this supposition,
Harari refers to the history of humankind,
placing focus on the 300-year-long history of humanism.
He does so not to predict the future,
but to make the point that the present as we know it today
was not inevitable.
It was only one of countless alternative futures that could have been.
Harari thus encourages readers to reorient their goals in the 21st century
to deliberately mold the coming decades and future centuries.
Part 1 of Homo Deus tackles the big question of what it means to be human
and questions whether humans are so different from other animals.
Part 2 examines the world manipulated and molded by humans.
This section places a critical lens on humanism,
the religion Harari argues shaped the modern world as we know it today.
The final part of Homo Deus paints a future
in which techno-religions prevail in lieu of the individual.
Part 3 comes full circle to state that from the perspective of dataism,
not only are humans no different from animals,
but they are also no more valuable than tomatoes or stones.
Their value lies in the data they contribute to the data flow of the universe.
Harari makes the further point
that neither democracy nor capitalism
will inevitably persist in the coming decades.
When these political and economic systems collapse,
what will take their place?
In a world where non-conscious algorithms
understand humans better than people know themselves,
what will society, politics, economics, and daily life look like?
And most chillingly, will humans still be relevant?
I. The New Human Agenda
Key Takeaway
Humanity's fight against famine, plague, and war
is coming to an end.
Up until recent decades,
famine, plague, and war
were the greatest and most insurmountable challenges facing humankind.
Advances in technology
and changes to global economics and politics
eradicated natural famines
and significantly decreased the rate of infectious disease.
They also broke the law of the jungle,
meaning war is no longer a persistent possibility.
In other words,
these inescapable death sentences
are now manageable challenges.
Key Takeaway
Key Takeaway
The old human agenda
will be replaced with the quest for immortality,
happiness, and divinity.
Now that famine, plague, and war
are demanding less attention,
immortality, happiness, and divinity
will likely become the new chief concerns.
Modern culture and science
view death as a technical problem to be solved
as opposed to an inevitability.
Many scientists and thinkers
already claim the goal of modern science
is to defeat death.
To do this,
scientists will need to re-engineer the human body.
When people are skeptical
about the possibility of an afterlife,
they become increasingly concerned
with happiness in their current lives.
This poses a problem, however,
as human biochemistry
is not designed for people
to be incessantly happy.
Pharmaceutical companies,
doctors, and even governments
have already begun
responding to this issue
with such psychiatric drugs
as Ritalin for hyperactive children
and antidepressants for ordinary sadness.
Implicit in the search
for immortality and happiness
is the desire to upgrade Homo sapiens
to Homo deus, or gods.
For thousands of years,
humans relied on external tools
to upgrade themselves.
In the future,
humans will upgrade themselves
with biological engineering,
cyborg engineering,
and the engineering
of non-organic beings.
Key Takeaways
Historians study the past
to be liberated from it.
Historians do not study the past
as not to repeat it,
but rather to examine possibilities
our ancestors never considered possible.
One's present world
looks and feels different
from that of past generations
because history leading up
to the present moment
shapes the technology,
politics, society,
thoughts, fears,
and dreams of today.
The historical narratives
we choose to tell
are important.
Consider how leaders
of social revolutions
rewrite history
to manipulate fears and dreams.
Marxists, for example,
refer to the history of capitalism
to espouse communism.
The predictions in this book
are presented to encourage discussion
about the current state of the world
and to consider how humans today
can take control
of the future for humankind.
The future envisioned by Harari
is based on a 300-year-long history
of humanism
in which the worship of humankind
became the chief religion.
However,
there is still opportunity
for the future to be reshaped
based on new goals and ideas
of the 21st century.
Part 1
Homo sapiens conquers the world.
Key Takeaway
Humans are the only animal species
to single-handedly change
global ecology.
The impact of humans
will be greater than that
of the asteroid
that caused the extinction
of dinosaurs.
That's because,
unlike natural phenomena
like ice ages
and volcanic eruptions,
humans are changing
the fundamental rules of nature.
humans have already begun
to askew natural selection
for intelligent design
and organic life
for inorganic forms.
They have transformed
the globe
from a patchwork
of distinct ecosystems
into a single ecosystem.
This change
began in the Stone Age
when Homo sapiens
emigrated out of East Africa
and hunted large mammals,
causing their near extinction
in a relatively short time.
The rate of change
has only accelerated since.
Key Takeaway
Humans deny the physical,
emotional,
and social needs
of animals.
The emotions
felt by animals
evolved over millions of years
and are similar
to those of humans.
The vast majority
of animals
on Earth today
are domesticated
by humans.
While it is tempting
to believe animal needs
are limited to survival
and reproduction,
science proves
the instincts,
drives,
and emotions
of animals
are similar
to those of humans.
Whereas 21st century humans
like ice cream
because their hunter-gatherer ancestors
gorged on sweet fruit
to maximize
their calorie intake,
domesticated pigs,
which are social
and intellectual
by nature,
can recognize
the unique squeals
of their offspring
and parents.
In a famous experiment
in which infant monkeys
were separated
from their mothers
and given the choice
of a metal dummy
with a milk bottle
or a soft cloth dummy
with no milk,
the monkeys
always chose
the cloth mother
despite its inability
to provide food.
These examples
demonstrate
that needs
which evolved
over millions of years
remain essential
in the present day
despite change conditions
to the external environment.
The mother-child bond
is one particularly strong
emotional need
and exists
in all mammals
and birds
and likely also
in reptiles and fish.
Yet the agricultural revolution
gave humans
the godlike agency
to deny vital needs
beyond mere survival
to domesticated animals.
Key Takeaway
Humans
first silenced animals
and then silenced gods.
This gave birth
to humanism.
Theist religions
justified
the superior position
humans took
over plants and animals
during the agricultural revolution.
Prior to the advent
of theism,
humans practiced
animist religions
in which humans
considered themselves
equal to
and in conversation
with plants,
animals,
and other aspects
of earth
including stones
and the sun.
When humans
domesticated plants
and animals,
they justified
their superiority
by sacrificing
animals to the gods
who in exchange
provided protection
and productivity.
The relationship
was once again
altered
at the dawn
of the scientific revolution
when humans
began silencing gods
in lieu of physics
and biology.
Humans
no longer
turned to gods
for answers
but to themselves
thus developing
a new religion
of humanism
and its successors,
liberalism
and communism
among others.
Key
Takeaway
Humans
and animals
have conscious minds.
Robots
cannot.
The mind
is a flow
of subjective
experiences.
Page 104
It's composed
of brief flashes
of sensations,
emotions,
and thoughts
that meld together
to create
a stream
of consciousness.
A person's
stream of consciousness
is characterized
by sensation
and desire.
While robots
can be programmed
to react
in certain ways,
the inorganic machine
does not itself
experience anything.
Most life scientists
today agree
that like humans,
mammals,
birds,
and at least
some reptiles
and fish,
experience a consciousness
based on sensation
and desire.
Current science,
however,
does not know
how biochemical reactions
in the brain
translate to subjective
sensations like pain
and love.
The more scientists
learn about the brain,
the less they understand
the mind.
Scientists face
the dilemma
if all sensations
are caused
by electrical activity
in the brain,
what is the mind?
Where does it exist?
and what purpose
does it serve?
Perhaps the better question
is whether the mind
exists.
Is it possible
the mind holds
moral and political value
but no biological function?
Key Takeaway
Humans dominate
not because of their
intelligence
and tool-making abilities,
but because of their
ability to cooperate
flexibly
in large numbers
of strangers.
Whereas bees and ants
cooperate in large numbers,
only humans cooperate
flexibly
in large numbers.
This means
when faced
with a new threat,
humans can creatively
reorganize
to target
a specific challenge.
While elephants
and chimpanzees
cooperate flexibly,
they do so
only with friends
and family.
Mass cooperation
among humans
is not based
on intimate relationships,
but uniquely
on shared beliefs
in imagined orders.
Because primates
cannot invent
and share
imagined stories,
their ability
to flexibly cooperate
is limited.
Imagined orders
are not limited
to religion.
They include
the U.S. dollar,
the E.U.,
and human rights.
Weaving together
a common network
of stories
is what gives
these imagined orders
meaning.
Part 2
Homo sapiens
gives meaning
to the world.
Key Takeaway
Imagined realities
are more powerful
than subjective
or objective realities.
The cognitive revolution
70,000 years ago
enabled homo sapiens
to create,
share,
and believe
fictional stories.
These stories
largely remained local
until the agricultural
revolution
60,000 years later.
Farming enabled humans
to crowd into cities
and protect
their mass societies
with expansive armies.
50,000 years later,
the invention
of writing
and money
enabled the development
of vast kingdoms.
Temples dedicated
to Sumerian gods
were the economic
and political center
of ancient Sumer,
just as modern brands
and corporations
are the focus
of modern cities today.
And just as Sumerian gods
did not exist anywhere
except in the imagination
of those who believed,
brands like Google
and Microsoft
are only imagined fictions.
Key Takeaway
The power of human organizations
is their ability
to force their fictional beliefs
on a submissive reality.
Page 170
Holy scriptures
work in the religious establishment
the same way
marks function
in the education system
and money works
in the economic system.
The bureaucracy
gains power
by declaring the authority
to proclaim scriptures,
marks,
or money
the definitive answer.
In the case of scripture,
the religious establishment
uses its holy scriptures
to persuade
not only individuals,
but also courts,
governments,
and businesses
to alter their realities
to act in concert
with what's written
in the scriptures.
Shared fictions
permit humans
to cooperate
on a large scale,
but only in service
of a fictional aim
or interest.
Like milk producers
that ignore
the emotional needs
of cows,
mass cooperation
shuns the social
and psychological needs
of the people
involved in the system.
One must continually ask,
is this the right aim
and the right way
to measure that aim?
For example,
if test scores rise 10%,
how can a school
be sure those test scores
are in fact
the best method
for measuring success?
More fundamentally,
what is meant
by success?
History isn't
a single narrative,
but thousands
of alternative narratives.
Whenever we choose
to tell one,
we are also choosing
to silence others.
Page 176
Key Takeaway
Science does not diminish
imagined realities
or come into direct conflict
with religions.
It strengthens them.
Computers and bioengineering
make it easier than ever
to shape reality
to match a desired fiction.
Religion is one such fiction,
created by humans
and defined by social function.
Religion is an all-encompassing story
that employs superhuman laws
and decrees to legitimize
human social structures.
Followers of Buddha,
Jesus,
Marx,
and Hitler
all aim for guidance
from a superhuman moral law.
These,
and all other religions,
share an insistence
that their religion
is the only true religion
and all others
are wrong.
Religion offers
a full explanation
of how things
are in the world
and provides its followers
a contract
with predetermined goals,
i.e.,
do not sin
and you will go to heaven.
This is markedly different
from spirituality,
an individual journey
in which a person
questions her beliefs
and moves
towards an unknown destination.
Therefore,
spirituality,
not science,
is the greatest threat
to religion
because it challenges
conventions.
Science and religion,
on the other hand,
enjoy a symbiotic relationship.
In many cases,
laboratories rely
on religious backing
and religiously dictated
ethical judgments
to justify
scientific research.
All religions
give ethical judgments
which are turned
into factual claims
and conflated
into practical guidelines
for how to live.
In the case of abortion,
for example,
devout Christians
make the ethical judgment
that human life
is sacred
and believe
as unequivocal fact
that the human life
begins at conception.
Science cannot refute
the ethical judgment,
but it can refute
the religious factual statement
with biological fact.
In these and other ways,
the history of science
is entristically tied
to religious beliefs.
Contrary to the common belief
that science and religion
are in opposition
because they are interested
in different truths,
science is chiefly
concerned with power
while religion
is preoccupied with order.
science seeks the power
to cure disease,
fight war,
and produce food,
whereas religion
desires order
to create and maintain
social structure.
Their interests,
therefore,
do not conflict.
It is this reason
the scientific revolution
could be born in Europe
during one of the most
hostile periods
of religious extremism
in human history.
Today,
science coexists
with the dominant religion
of humanism.
In the future,
it may rely
on a post-humanist religion.
Key Takeaway
Humans have given up meaning
in exchange for power.
The hallmark of modernity
is the trade of meaning
for power.
Pre-modern peoples
conducted their lives
with the belief
that their actions
played a specific role
in a great cosmic orchestra.
Modern culture
dispenses with the idea
of a cosmic plan
and shrugs the idea
of purpose.
If modernity has a motto,
it is
Shit Happens.
Page 200
Humans have the power
to curb famine,
plague,
and war.
But when asked
the meaning of this power,
the modern scientist
only shrugs.
Modernity is a constant drive
for power
in a meaningless world.
Key Takeaway
Scientific progress
and economic growth
work in concert
to propel modernity.
Science could not progress
until the advent of credit,
a system based on trust
in the future.
Whereas medieval plague
would cause peasants
to raise their eyes to God,
the Ebola outbreak of 2014
prompted investors worldwide
to buy shares
of pharmaceutical companies.
The modern economy
works so that
when a venture succeeds,
trust in the future
increases,
credit expands,
interest rates fall,
and entrepreneurs
raise more money
to develop
new technologies.
Whereas pre-modern humans
saw the economy
as a zero-sum game
and therefore relied
on religion
to redistribute resources,
modernity views
economic growth
as a necessity.
Economists say growth
is essential
because it raises
the standard of living
by encouraging
increased consumption,
stabilizes the economy
in a growing population,
and avoids violence
by preventing the dilemma
of whether to take
from the rich
to give to the poor.
Key Takeaway
Free Market Capitalism
is the New Religion
Nearly all modern religions,
ideologies,
and movements agree
the answer to happiness
is economic growth.
Growth is not a natural law,
but rather a product
of modern times.
While Turkey's Islamic president,
Rejip Tayyip Erdogan,
and India's Hindu prime minister,
Narendra Modi,
are favored for their
economic track record
and commitment
to continued growth,
the Ottoman sultans
and Indian maharajas
of past centuries
enjoyed successful
political careers
in absence
of economic growth.
While the religion
of free market capitalism
solves many ethical dilemmas,
it does so
at the cost
of other values,
most notably
family bonds.
Key Takeaway
Knowledge
is the only
inexhaustible resource.
It's necessary
for growth.
There are three kinds
of resources
in the world.
Raw materials,
energy,
and knowledge.
While raw materials
and energy
have a limited supply,
knowledge is infinite
and increases
the supply
of the other two.
When scientists
learn how to
efficiently harness
solar energy,
that knowledge
causes the energy
supply to grow.
The search
for new knowledge
is a modern pursuit.
In pre-modern times,
people believed
holy scriptures
provided all knowledge
and there was nothing
more to be learned
or discovered.
Therefore,
prior to the
scientific revolution,
humankind
was stagnant.
It was not until
the discovery
of ignorance
that humankind
could progress.
Key Takeaway
Ecological Collapse
is the Greatest Threat
to Modern Society
When ecology
breaks down,
the economy
will plummet,
politics will erupt
in chaos,
and the human
standard of living
will deflate.
One way
to reduce
the risk
of ecological collapse
is to slow
down progress.
However,
the religion
of economic growth
will not allow this.
Instead of tackling
the problem
at its source,
free market capitalism
says new products
should solve
the problem
of a destabilized
ecosystem
and endangered humanity.
In China,
for example,
instead of reducing
pollution,
air purification
systems are marketed
as luxury goods
to the wealthy.
There is no guarantee
that future progress
will stave off
economic stagnation
or ecological disaster.
If the ecological
apocalypse does occur,
the poor will suffer
more than the wealthy.
Further,
the rich may become
increasingly blasé
towards global warming
as advances in technology
isolate the privileged
from ecological disaster.
This is evident
in the policy
of the United States.
Despite being
the world's greatest polluter,
the U.S. refuses
to curb emissions
at the cost of growth.
Climate scientists
and world leaders agree
that to fail
to address climate change
is to gamble
the future of humankind.
However,
wealthy presidents
and CEOs
who refuse to adopt
climate change policy
do not believe
global warming
will affect them personally.
The fact that
these people
are in charge
is highly dangerous
and deeply worrisome.
Key Takeaway
Humanism
made it possible
for humankind
to flourish
under capitalism
because for humanists
feelings
give meaning
to one's life
and the world
around him.
In a capitalist world
where everything
including the courts
and police
are for sale,
social collapse
would seem inevitable.
Humankind,
however,
saved itself
and even flourished
by practicing
the religion
of capitalism
while also
worshipping humanity.
In humanism,
the authority of God
and the laws of nature
are replaced
by humans themselves.
Instead of referring
to the cosmos
for meaning,
humanists
turn inwards
to create meaning
for a meaningless world.
Page 221
Instead of relying
on holy books
for guidance,
humanists
refer to their feelings.
Humanists
consider murder bad
not because of the commandment
thou shalt not kill
but because murder
causes suffering.
Feelings not only
give meaning
to one's personal life
but also to social
and political processes,
aesthetics,
economics,
and education.
According to the humanists,
the voter knows best,
beauty is in the eye
of the beholder,
the customer is always right,
and students
should think
for themselves.
Above all,
humanists believe
if it feels good,
do it.
Key Takeaway
Knowledge
equals experience
times sensitivity
In medieval Europe,
knowledge was gleaned
using the formula
scriptures
times logic.
To answer a question
about the world,
a person would refer
to the scriptures
and then deduce
the logical answer.
In the scientific revolution,
the formula was updated
to empirical data
times mathematics.
Scientists gathered
empirical data
and used mathematics
to analyze
the collected data.
Now,
in the age of humanism,
one answers ethical questions
by observing gears
of collected inner experience
and using a honed sensitivity
to understand
her experiences.
The formula
knowledge
equals experience
times sensitivity
is applied
to one's perception
of everything
from wine
to war.
Wars of previous eras
revolved around gods,
kings,
generals,
and other heroes.
Today,
humanists are more concerned
with the experience
of the common soldier
through his eyes
and emotions.
Key Takeaway
There are three branches
of humanism,
all of which
are flawed.
Humanism
splintered,
as do all religions.
Orthodox humanists
or liberal humanists
believe each human
is a unique individual
with a singular inner voice
and idiosyncratic experiences.
Liberalism,
therefore,
believes
individual free will
should be
the chief authority
above state interests
and religious doctrine.
The problem
with liberalism
is that
if everyone's feelings
are valuable,
how does society
account for the hundreds
of differing
and contradicting opinions?
Liberalism
engenders
socialist humanism
and evolutionary humanism.
Socialism
does not emphasize
the uniqueness
of one's own experience,
as does liberalism,
but instead
considers how
one's actions
influence the experiences
of others
and how the society
in which a person
operates
influences her feelings.
Evolutionary humanism,
to which the Nazis
subscribed,
employs Darwin's theory
of natural selection
to argue for a superior race,
tribe,
or individual.
Throughout the 20th century,
communists
and authoritarian regimes
were toppled,
giving birth to democracies
in countries worldwide.
Techno-religions
are the only
plausible alternatives,
though they are not yet
fully realized.
Religious extremists,
like Islamic fundamentalists,
do not pose a threat
to liberalism
because their religious ideals
do not offer answers
to the technological questions
of the 21st century.
People may go on
believing Islam
and other traditional religions,
but history demonstrates
the future is not shaped
by backward-looking masses,
but instead
by small groups
of forward-looking thinkers.
Liberalism
may not persist forever.
We don't know
what will replace it,
but we can be assured
it won't be
medieval fanaticism.
Part 3
Homo sapiens
loses control
Key Takeaway
21st century science
undermines liberalism
because science disproves
the existence
of free will
and individualism.
Science and liberalism
are opposed to one another
because science
does not accept
the liberalist fact
that humans have free will
and that individual free will
is of vital importance.
Science cannot verify
John kiss Susie
because of free will,
but instead
says he did so
because of electrochemical
processes in the brain.
Our actions
are not free,
but rather determined
by algorithms
in the body.
In this way,
free will is yet
another imaginary fiction.
While a person
may feel
as if she has
free will
because she chooses
how to act upon
her desires,
what one must understand
is that her desires
are not freely chosen.
When Jane craves
chocolate
instead of a cucumber,
she cannot explain
why she wants
the chocolate.
Her biochemical processes
create a sensation
of wanting chocolate.
Why this happens
is unbeknownst to Jane.
This is important
because if animals,
including humans,
do not process
free will,
humans can use drugs,
genetic engineering,
and direct brain stimulation
to manipulate
and control
such complex desires
as love and fear.
Scientists are already
planting computer chips
in brains
to treat depression.
Key Takeaway
The individual self
is an imagined fiction.
There is no one individual.
Instead,
the brain
has a narrating
and an experiencing self.
They are not
mutually exclusive.
The narrative self
relies on the experiencing self
to tell its stories,
and the feelings
of the experiencing self
are shaped,
in part,
by the stories told
by the narrating self.
The narrating
and experiencing
selves
push and pull
at one another.
For example,
the narrating self
makes a New Year's resolution
to go to the gym.
When it's time
to go to the gym,
the experiencing self
sabotages
the narrating self
by not feeling
it wants to go
to the gym.
While people
identify
with the narrating self,
they are often ruled
by the experiencing self.
Because life sciences
tell us
there is no one
continuous individual self,
we must accept
that the individual self
is yet another
imagined fiction,
like gods
and nations.
The individual
is a myth
composed of
fleeting moments
processed
by biochemical
algorithms.
We already
use technology
that dispenses
of free will
and individualism.
We must now ask
whether the liberalists
pillars of democracy,
free market,
and human rights
can survive an age
without the myth
of the individual.
Key Takeaway
21st Century Developments
Will Render Liberalism
and Entire Classes
of Workers
Obsolete
In our current century,
humans are likely
to become useless
in the economic
and military spheres
as soldiers lose
their jobs
to drones
and workers lose
their value
to automation.
When humans
lose economic
and political value,
the story of liberalism
is difficult to sell.
If there is no
economic value
in the moral argument
for the individual,
what incentives
do governments have
to continue pushing
the liberalist narrative?
Humans
will thus cease
to have economic value
and will only be valued
when part of a collective
that benefits those
in power.
The few
who will be valued
for their uniqueness
will have been upgraded
to an elite class
of superhumans.
Artificial intelligence
can easily replace
human workers
because the modern workforce
is predicated
on specialization.
A machine
cannot perform
all human abilities,
but it can be programmed
with the algorithms
needed to perform
a specific job.
For this reason,
algorithms
will replace
the working class
and redirect power
to an increasingly
wealthy
and powerful elite.
Thus,
social and economic
equality
will be driven
ever further apart.
When thinking
about job creation
in the future,
humans are tasked
with inventing jobs
that they can do better
than algorithms.
Key Takeaway
21st century technologies
in which life sciences
merges with computer sciences
may overthrow
the liberalist idea
of the individual.
Fewer and fewer people
see themselves
as individuals
and more
as biochemical mechanisms
best monitored
and guided
by external algorithms.
The dissolution
of the individual
is already evident
in the realm
of medical technology.
Diabetics
carry sensors
that check
their blood sugar
and healthy people
wear armbands
that record
biometric data.
The collected data
is processed
by an external algorithm
which results
in advice
provided to the human
for how to improve
one's health.
The use
of such technology
is quickly becoming
a religious activity.
It is also
facilitating
the demise
of the individual
and the rise
of the self
as biochemical processes.
The way in which
people hand over
medical decisions
to algorithms
is likely to be transferred
to all other aspects
of life
from voting
to choosing a mate.
People already
elect to hand over
control
when they record
their daily lives
on social media
and maintain
a constant
internet connection.
Given the right
authorization,
Google could collect,
store,
and analyze
the totality
of a person's
collective experiences,
thereby knowing
a person better
than one understands
oneself.
Based on the information
learned through algorithms,
Google could suggest
not only which product
to buy
or at which restaurant
to eat,
but also for which
candidate to vote
and whom to marry.
The higher the success
rate of such algorithms,
the more people
trust them
and the more willing
they are to trade
their individualism
for the authority
of the algorithm.
In this way,
life sciences,
not computer technology,
weakens the notion
of the individual.
Eventually,
inorganic algorithms
will not merely advise
organic algorithms,
but will also merge
with them.
Key Takeaway
New techno-religions
will rise from laboratories
when liberalism collapses.
Techno-religions
will promise salvation
through algorithms
and genes
in the same way
socialism
promised salvation
through the steam engine
and electricity.
The most dangerous religions
are not bred
in the Bible Belt
or by the Islamic State,
but in Silicon Valley.
Here,
computer scientists
promise immortality
and happiness
through technology.
There are two categories
of techno-religions,
techno-humanism,
and data religion.
The former believes
Homo sapiens
are coming to their end
and should dedicate
their final days
to creating
Homo Deus.
These upgraded humans
will have enhanced
physical and mental
capabilities
that will enable them
to compete
with sophisticated algorithms,
while uncomfortable desires
will be downgraded
and controlled.
In the absence
of free will,
techno-humanists
seek to redesign
and control will.
The question
we must ask today
are which desires
and experiences
will techno-humanists
prioritize
and program?
The second techno-religion,
dataism,
is based on the idea
that all phenomena
and entities
share a common language
of data.
This means
everything from a symphony
to the flu virus
contributes data
to the universe
of data flows,
which can be analyzed
using one set
of concepts
and tools.
Dataism is attractive
because it unites
all sciences.
Musicologists,
economists,
and cell biologists
could in theory
understand one another
using the language
of data.
However,
under dataism,
the task
of processing data
will be assigned
to electronic algorithms,
not human scientists.
You may not agree
with the idea
that organisms
are algorithms
and that giraffes,
tomatoes,
and human beings
are just different methods
for processing data,
but you should know
that this is the current
scientific dogma
and it is changing
our world
beyond recognition.

Key Takeaway
The changes in the brain
the techno-humanist
envisions
for the second
cognitive revolution
are akin
to evolutionary changes
that occurred
in the brain
over millennia,
albeit
at an inorganically
accelerated pace.
By making
minute changes
to the brain
using genetic engineering,
nanotechnology,
and brain-computer interfaces,
researchers
hope to launch
a second
cognitive revolution
in which the new species
of Homo deus
will access
unprecedented experiences.
While this may
sound frightening,
the human brain
already adapts
in response
to its changing environment.
In the transition
from hunter-gatherer societies
to the agricultural revolution,
for example,
Homo sapiens'
acute sense of smell
was severely dampened
as humans
no longer needed
to sniff the wind
to find mushrooms
or their neighbors
to sense fear.
Instead,
they needed
to refocus
their energy
on the new demands
of mathematics,
reading,
and writing.
In the second
cognitive revolution,
the human brain
is likely to lose
other sensations
no longer needed
in the new environment
to make more space
for processing data.
For millions of years,
we were enhanced chimpanzees.
In the future,
we may become
oversized ants.

Key Takeaway
The danger with dataism
mirrors the downfall
of communism.
Centralized processing
does not work
as well as distributed processing
during times
of accelerated
technological change.
Economists apply dataism
to the economy
where communism
is interpreted
as a centralized
data processing system
and capitalism
is a distributed
data processing system.
In communist economies,
all data flows
to one central processor,
the government.
In this situation,
producers and consumers
do not communicate.
The price of bread
and the amount produced
is determined
by a central authority
and dictated to bakeries.
In contrast,
capitalism connects
the producer
directly with the consumer.
In the case of bread,
individual bakeries
decide how much bread
to produce
and what price
to charge,
while the consumer
decides how much bread
to buy
and if she will purchase
the bread
at the proposed price.
In this way,
free market capitalism
is propelled
by independent
yet interconnected
data processors.
Free market capitalism
prevailed over communism
in the Cold War,
not because it's
the more ethical option,
but because when
the central processor
of communism
made a mistake,
the consequences
were more dire
and less easily corrected
than were the mistakes
of a single node
in the capitalist machine.
Key Takeaway
Democracy may die
in an age
of accelerated technology.
Like economic systems,
political structures
can be discussed
in the language
of dataism,
where authoritarianism
is centralized processing
while democracy
is distributed
data processing.
Democracies
are the preferred
political structure today
because the political systems
of the 20th century
advanced more quickly
than technology did.
Thus,
politicians and voters
were able
to manipulate technology.
In an age
when technology
moves more quickly
than politics,
elections,
political parties,
and parliaments
may be rendered
inefficient
and obsolete.
Further,
we can learn
from previous times
in which central processing
was more efficient
than distributed processing,
such as in the Roman Empire,
and thus autocratic rule
was the preferred mode
of politics.
Democracies may once again
become inefficient
and fall out of fashion.
Dictatorships
and authoritarianism
of old
will not be the answer.
Like democracies,
they cannot process
the onslaught
of data.
Instead of leading,
they can only
administrate.
The new structures
that will inevitably
come to replace
democracies
and authoritarianism
are impossible
to predict.
It's equally difficult
to discern
who will build
and control
these new systems.
key takeaway
The dataist revolution
will be predicted
on function
and will replace
human feeling.
Dataism does not
care about humanism,
but it is not
anti-humanist either.
It takes the position
that the data
contributed by humans
is equal to the data
contributed by tomatoes
and sharks.
Data is purely functional
and does not take
human experience
into consideration.
It makes sense, then,
that humans try to prove
their individual value
by contributing
to the data flow
through blogging
and posting pictures
on Facebook.
Humans are fighting
to stay relevant
in a world
that is pushing them out
in a similar fashion
that carriage-pulling horses
were cast aside
with the introduction
of cars.
The dataist revolution
is unlikely to occur
in our lifetimes.
It will take time
for human behavior
to shift completely
from a human-centric
view of the world
to one with data
at the center.
When it happens,
computing power
will completely take over
the role of feelings.
This is already happening
when Facebook
and Google algorithms
analyze your data
input to determine
how you feel
and what you want.
It's important
to realize
that major algorithms,
like those used
by Facebook and Google,
are developed
by large teams.
No one individual
fully understands
how the algorithm
itself works.
As algorithms
become more sophisticated
and machine learning
becomes more advanced,
algorithms will develop
independently
of a human engineer.
key takeaway.
Dataism could manipulate
and possibly eradicate
Homo sapiens,
the same way humans
dominated and exterminated
animal species.
In many ways,
dataism threatens
to repeat human history
back onto itself.
Humans created
a global network
and considered
every aspect of the Earth
in relation to humans.
Humans made themselves
the most functional aspect
of the global network
and lauded themselves
with praise.
In doing so,
humans relegated
all other animal species
to a second class,
rebuffing them
for their inability
to perform
the same functions
as humans.
When dataism
reorganizes the system
so humans no longer
provide an essential function,
they too
may become extinct.
This view is only
a prediction
and not a prophecy.
If it comes true,
it will be because
a pan-science
based on data
has emerged.
Intelligence will have
become separated
from consciousness
and algorithms
will have understood
humans better
than they could ever
understand themselves.
