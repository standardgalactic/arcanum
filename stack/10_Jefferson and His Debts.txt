No other figure in American history, except Washington and Lincoln, stands closer to the
heart of America's national identity than Thomas Jefferson. He was the author of the
Declaration of Independence, and in that declaration he defined the spirit of the
American Revolution as an experiment in enlightenment, politics, and philosophy.
He was the second American, after Washington, to ascend to the level of a symbol of American liberty.
And his home in Virginia, Monticello, exists today as a kind of temple for that symbol.
Even Abraham Lincoln, who privately deplored Jefferson's example as a slaveholder, felt
compelled to genuflect publicly before Jefferson's example as the most distinguished politician
of our history. Yet Jefferson was also, in addition to being a politician and a symbol, a man of
extraordinary intellectual gifts and intellectual tastes. A man who liked to think of himself as
simply an American version of the Enlightenment's rational elite. A philosophe, to borrow the
French term, a virtuoso, to borrow the Italian one. Almost his entire life was lived in politics,
yet he had little love for the practical day-to-day grind of vote-getting and administration.
Science is my passion, he briefly remarked. Politics my duty. He served as the third president of the
United States from 1801 till 1809, but he served for more than twice as long as the president of the
American Philosophical Society. He claimed in 1812 that, when I was young, mathematics was the passion
of my life. And even as president of the United States, he dabbled industriously in anthropology,
meteorology, religion, and history. And of course, it was Jefferson who sponsored the first great scientific
expedition of the New Republic, Meriwether Lewis and William Clark's core of discovery, and their journey from 1804 to 1806
to map and catalog the North American continent from the Mississippi River to the Pacific.
When he was asked in 1771 to compose a list of basic books, Jefferson came up with 28 titles,
which spanned poetry, fiction, politics, history, philosophy, and the classics. He recommended Locke on the
conduct of the mind in search of truth, Montesquieu, Franklin on electricity, Epictetus, Seneca, a heavy dose of
the Scots, and even a textbook on physics and surgery. Forty years and a lifetime of book collecting later,
Jefferson's collection of 6,000 books became the core around which the Library of Congress was rebuilt
after the British burned the Capitol in the War of 1812. Jefferson even had the mannerisms we've come to
associate with an intellectual. Jefferson is a slender man, wrote the rough-hewn Pennsylvanian,
William McClay, who sat in the first Federal Congress and who had manifest opportunity to observe
Jefferson at close range. Jefferson is a slender man, has rather the air of stiffness in his manner.
His clothes seem too small for him. He sits in a lounging manner, on one hip commonly, and with one of his shoulders
elevated much above the other. His face has a scrawny aspect. His whole figure has a loose, shackling air.
He had a rambling, vacant look, and nothing of that firm collected deportment which I expected.
And yet, even though Jefferson was a poor public speaker, his informal conversation was invariably a revelation.
He scattered information wherever he went, McClay marveled, and some even brilliant sentiments sparkled from him.
In the largest sense, although Jefferson wrote only one full-length book in 1781, his Notes on the State of Virginia,
which appeared anonymously in a privately printed edition in 1785, and then was republished in Philadelphia in 1788,
Jefferson defined a classical Republican political philosophy, which stood over against the liberal Republicanism of Alexander Hamilton.
And which, in Jefferson's mind, went a long way towards excusing the atrocities of the French Revolution.
It was a philosophy which defined the role of government in the Republic, addressed the question of religion in an Enlightenment political regime,
and swerved fatally from a confrontation with slavery.
Jefferson's political philosophy was a force in his day, and it remains one in ours.
Thomas Jefferson was born on April 13, 1743, at the family plantation of Shadwell.
Because a fire destroyed Shadwell in 1770, and most of the 27-year-old Jefferson's papers with it,
painfully little survives of Jefferson's intellectual coming of age.
What we do know, however, is how much of that coming of age was connected to representatives of the Scottish Enlightenment.
His first tutor, a Church of England clergyman named William Douglas, was a Scot and a graduate of Glasgow and Edinburgh.
And when Jefferson arrived at William and Mary to begin his collegiate studies in 1760,
the college was in the hands of another Scot, William Small, whom Jefferson described as
a man profound in most of the useful branches of science, with a happy talent of communication,
correct and gentlemanly manners, and an enlarged and liberal mind.
The most immediate contribution Small made was not philosophical, but legal.
He introduced Jefferson to George Wythe, and Jefferson proceeded to study law under Wythe's tutelage in Williamsburg,
until he was admitted to the bar in 1767.
Two years later, Jefferson's elected to the House of Burgesses, as a protege of the Randolph and Pendleton families.
Jefferson's mother, by the way, was a Randolph.
He scored a minor sensation with the publication of an anti-imperial pamphlet in 1774.
Jefferson's summary view of the rights of British America.
And so, in 1775, he found himself sent to Philadelphia to sit in the Second Continental Congress,
a colonial lawyer, among other colonial lawyers.
Thereby hangs a tale, because up until the 18th century, law was hardly a profession at all.
Administration of the law was in the hands of appointed magistrates and justices of the peace,
who only rarely had any formal education in law.
And jury trials, well, those were pretty vanishingly rare.
Lawyers were, in general, not much more than gentlemen who happened to have a smattering of legal literacy.
In fact, in 17th century New England, professional lawyering was actually prohibited by statute.
However, as the British Empire awoke throughout the 18th century,
for the need to establish uniform laws and practices in the colonies,
so did the need for professional lawyers and for judges.
Even so, by 1775, there were only 45 practicing attorneys in Massachusetts.
One reason for the comparatively small number of lawyers was that law was not terribly lucrative by itself.
People who hoped to make money from law hoped really to do it through the opening law gave them to politics,
and through politics, to patronage and influence.
Another reason why lawyering did not take off at once in popularity was that,
in practice, criminal law was largely a matter of punishment for moral or religious offenses against a community,
or in probating wills.
It was not terribly involved with the protection of property,
and the punishments were almost always bodily and savage,
such as whippings and brandings.
The notion of institutional imprisonment for criminal violators
would not result in the construction of an American prison until the 1790s.
Civil law was not much more attractive as a pursuit,
for it was preoccupied with matters of inheritance and debt,
debt being the one thing which really could get you imprisoned.
The laws these lawyers debated sprang from two sources.
One was statute law.
In other words, law created by the colonial legislatures.
The other was British common law,
that vague mass of legal precedent and traditional procedure in British law,
which judges and magistrates interpreted and applied by their own lights,
without consultation with legislatures.
And up until the eve of the revolution,
it was common law proceedings which governed most of colonial law.
Judges and magistrates, not legislatures,
decided what was law and what was punishment.
But the American Revolution changed this.
Having thrown off British political rule,
Americans wondered why their courts should continue to operate by British common law.
The revolutionary saw no more wisdom in allowing a single man to rule by his own whim as king
than allowing magistrates and judges to rule by their whim in court.
And it did not help the reputation of common law that the prevailing common law textbook of the day,
Sir William Blackstone's Commentaries on the Laws of England,
which enjoyed a circulation of nearly 2,500 copies in America by 1776,
Blackstone tried to base common law on the sovereignty of the king.
So that did not create a more fragrant odor for common law in the nostrils of the revolutionaries.
If, in the new revolutionary and republican climate,
sovereignty resided in the people rather than the king,
then the place where law should be made was in the legislature,
and cast in the form of legislative statute rather than in judges' chambers citing common law.
If Blackstone hoped to make all law into the king's law,
the American tendency was to limit all law to legislative statute.
Jefferson never developed any significant law practice of his own.
He was involved in only 941 cases over seven years,
and he stopped practicing law altogether after 1776.
But the legal problems posed by common law about sovereignty,
inheritance, debt, and slavery
became the central problems of his life.
And no wonder.
Jefferson was born into a well-to-do family,
but his father died while he was in his teens,
and the terms of his father's will put all the power of his inheritance
into the hands of the will's executors.
Even permission to attend William and Mary
had to be obtained from his guardian, John Harvey.
He married Martha Wales in 1772,
only to lose her to complications of childbirth in 1782,
and never remarried.
But through his wife, Jefferson inherited some 11,000 acres of land,
and 135 slaves,
which he added to the 5,000 acres and 50 slaves
that came to him after the death of his mother in 1773.
This made Jefferson one of the biggest landowners in Virginia.
And by then, he was already well on his way
to designing and building that great mountaintop home
that he dreamt of as his great sanctuary,
Mounticello.
The problem was that his father-in-law's estate
had also arrived burdened with debt.
And the costs of building Mounticello
and the costs of the Virginia gentry lifestyle
gradually turned from pleasures
into inescapable burdens for Thomas Jefferson.
Wartime inflation during the Revolution
rotted the value of his property.
Twenty-two of his slaves ran off
to find freedom with the British.
By the end of his life,
he would be over $100,000 in debt.
And those debts enraged him.
Indebtedness threatened him with loss of control,
and fear of the loss of control
triggered staggering bouts of migraine
and bowel cramps for Jefferson.
It saddled him with the humiliation
of constantly bowing the knee to creditors,
to moneylenders,
to the merchants who supplied his books
and the importers who supplied his wines.
In Jefferson's mind,
only a nation of those who owned
enough property
freely to support themselves
without dependents,
only they could really
create a republic.
When debt-ridden farmers
in western Massachusetts
staged an uprising in 1786,
Jefferson frankly sympathized with them.
Can history produce an instance
of a rebellion so honorably conducted,
Jefferson asked?
God forbid we should ever be 20 years
without such a rebellion.
The tree of liberty must be refreshed
from time to time
with the blood of patriots and tyrants.
And maybe also the blood of creditors.
This resentment at the dependence
imposed by debt
took a more organized form
in a letter Jefferson wrote
to James Madison in 1789.
while Jefferson was still serving
as American minister to France.
Jefferson had enjoyed
a front-row seat in Paris that summer
for the outbreak of the French Revolution.
And the prospect of the French Revolution
alternately excited and appalled him.
Clearly, in Jefferson's mind,
the violence of the French Revolution
was due entirely to the way
a tiny elite of aristocratic families
had reduced most of France's population
to debt, squalor, and loss of land.
No creditor, Jefferson wrote.
And mind you,
in Jefferson's thinking,
creditors could just as easily be
bankers and merchants
as feudal aristocrats.
No creditor, he insisted,
can, by natural right,
oblige the lands someone occupies.
or the persons who succeed him
in that occupation
to the payment of debts
contracted by him.
And by performing
a series of actuarial calculations,
he informed Madison that,
by rights,
19 years
is the term beyond which
neither the representatives
of a nation,
nor even the whole nation
itself assembled,
can validly extend a debt.
perhaps it was only
coincidental
that the
19 years
he allotted
for the permissible run
of debts
was just one year shy
of the 20 years
he allotted
for permissible revolutions
and the bloody watering
of the Tree of Liberty.
It certainly blinded him
to the follies
of the French Revolution
as that revolution
was blowing up
around his ears
in Paris
in 1789.
The summer of the
French Revolution
began
with King Louis XVI
yielding to the demand
for a calling
of the National Assembly,
the Etat General.
That, in turn,
resulted
in the swift capture
of the Etat General's
leadership
by its most radical members,
by the seizure
of the king,
and by the imposition
of a somewhat
constitutional monarchy.
When the king
attempted to escape
he was recaptured
and then
tried
and executed
and after his death
a reign
of revolutionary terror
inspired by
Maximilian Robespierre
and his party,
the Jacobins,
swept over Paris
and over France.
To all
of the butcheries
and the terrorism
instituted
by the Jacobins,
Jefferson turned
a resolutely
blind eye.
He praised
the Jacobins
for their
resolution
to set fire
to the four corners
of the kingdom
and to perish
with it themselves
rather than
to relinquish
an iota
from their plan
of a total change
of government.
When Jefferson
returned to the United States
later in 1789
to become
the first Secretary of State
under President
George Washington,
Jefferson's adulation
for the French Revolution
continued without pause.
The Jacobins,
he said,
were the true
revolution spirit
of the whole nation.
And he found it
sickening,
sickening
that uncomprehending
Americans
like Washington
and Hamilton
call the French
barbarous
and inhuman
because when
justly incensed
they've made
examples of
two or three thousand
scoundrels
to rescue the liberties
of millions
of honest men.
By 1793
Jefferson was compelled
to admit
a little bit more
that in the struggle
which was necessary
many guilty persons
fell without
the forms of trial
and with them
some innocent.
But this was simply
the collateral damage
of revolution.
My own affections
had been deeply wounded
by some of the martyrs
to this cause
but rather than
it should have failed
I would have seen
half the earth
desolated.
Were there but
an Adam and an Eve
left in every country
and left free
it would be better
than it is now.
What the Jacobins
accomplished
in France
Jefferson hoped
that statute law
might accomplish
peacefully
in the United States.
And his political
philosophy seems
to have nothing
more substantial
to it than
an expectation
that virtuous citizens
by reason
of their virtue
could make government
almost unnecessary.
But instead
of the new constitution
rendering government
unnecessary
Jefferson was infuriated
to discover
that the old
fiscal policies
of indebtedness
and collection
were being reimposed
through statute
as designed
by the new
secretary of the treasury
Alexander Hamilton.
At the end
of the revolution
the United States
was catastrophically
in debt.
First to the French
and then to the Dutch
but also to
its own people.
Many
a fiscal crisis
during the revolution
had been averted
by individuals
stepping forward
to loan money
to the Continental Congress
or by merchants
and farmers
accepting Congress's
IOUs
for food
and supplies
for the armies.
One quick way
for the new
United States
to deal with
these debts
was to repudiate
them
and to wish
tough luck
to the Congress's
hapless creditors.
But Hamilton
was convinced
that a repudiation
of their revolutionary debts
would be
a terrible decision.
For one thing
many of the holders
of Congress's
IOUs
were ordinary
pensioners
veterans.
They were patriot
souls
who would now
be ruined
if the government
repudiated its debts.
But on a larger scale
repudiation
would be a signal
to foreign nations
that the United States
was an unworthy
debtor.
And in that case
supplies
of foreign credit
would dry up.
And without
that foreign credit
it would be impossible
for Americans
to overcome
a hundred years
of economic restriction
by the British
that had prevented
Americans
from developing
a commercial
manufacturing base.
So in a series
of three
great reports
to Congress
Hamilton recommended
with as much
persuasive power
as he could muster
a commitment
by Congress
to pay off
its revolutionary
debts
to build up
American manufacturing
to establish
a national bank
to fund
commercial development
and
in a display
of his belief
that only the federal
government
could pull
all of this off
the assumption
by the federal
government
of all of the
states
revolutionary
war debts
as well
and all
by statute.
Hamilton's plan
neatly captured
everything
likely to bring
on one of
Jefferson's
famous migraines.
It made debt
untouchable.
It put
manufacturing
and the money
lending
that manufacturing
required
in the driver's
seat of the
American economy.
And it guaranteed
that independent
farmers
would increasingly
find themselves
forced to bear
the burdens
not only of
indebtedness
enforced by statute
but of the taxes
the federal government
would levy
to fund
those debts
its own debts
acquired during
the revolution.
If a debt
is once contracted
by a farmer
Jefferson wrote bitterly
it is never paid
but by a sale.
Although Jefferson
was anything
but a typical
yeoman farmer
he increasingly
spoke as though
he was one
and as though
Hamilton was
trying through
the creation
of a cash
grubbing finance
aristocracy
to bring back
the British Empire
now look
to a single
and splendid
government
of an aristocracy
founded on
banking institutions
and moneyed
in corporations
under the guise
and cloak
of their favored
branches
of manufactures
commerce
and navigation
riding and ruling
over the plundered
and beggared
yeomanry
Jefferson predicted.
This mistrust
led to a massive
fracture
of the revolutionary
generation
into two hostile
political parties
the federalists
who enlisted
Washington
Hamilton
and John Adams
as their figureheads
and the hyphenated
Democratic Republicans
led by Jefferson
and Madison.
In time
this fracture
would be more
than political
it would come
to violence
In 1804
one of Jefferson's
most prominent
disciples
Aaron Burr Jr.
would maneuver
Hamilton
into fighting
a duel
and kill him.
Thomas Jefferson
was elected
president
in 1800
partly because
the Federalists
had quarreled
and divided
but also partly
because of slavery.
Slavery
has always
been the dog
in Thomas Jefferson's
manger
principally because
the author
of the proposition
that all men
are created equal
held
other human beings
in a very
unequal state
of bondage
but also because
on closer inspection
he actually
sold slaves
to pay off
debts
and conducted
a long-term
liaison
with a female
slave
Sally Hemings
who was herself
the offspring
of an illicit
master-slave union
in this case
Jefferson's
father-in-law
which means
by the way
that Sally
Hemings
was actually
Martha Jefferson's
half-sister
by blood.
He never
pretended
that he had
an excuse
for keeping
black slaves.
In his notes
on the state
of Virginia
in the 1780s
Jefferson admitted
that slaves
were as fully
entitled to liberty
as anyone else
and he trembled
at the prospect
of a slave revolt.
The almighty
has no attribute
which can take
side with us
in such a contest.
But at the same time
Jefferson's
own
fragile
independence
rested squarely
on the shoulders
of his slaves.
They
represented
the capital
he could liquidate
when the creditors
came knocking
and they
produced the goods
that paid
the creditors
at all other times.
Nor as it turned out
could he have been
president without them
either.
In order to
placate
the southern states
the Constitutional
Convention
in 1787
allowed
the southern states
to count
three-fifths
of their slaves
toward the calculation
of their electoral votes.
Without
those extra
electoral votes
Jefferson would have
lost the election
of 1800.
With it
he not only won
the presidency
but installed
a democratic
Jeffersonian ascendancy
which would
dominate the
American presidency
with but a few
interruptions
for the next
60 years.
had he been
more
of a practical
politician
than a
political philosopher
Jefferson
might have been
more successful
in dismantling
the structures
of finance
and manufacturing
created by
Hamilton
in the 1790s.
Well it was not
for lack of trying
but Hamilton
had
cannier
political
instincts
and he had
built better
than Jefferson
could dismantle.
and Hamilton
had as his
great second
the man
who would
become
Jefferson's
next nemesis
the Chief Justice
of the Supreme Court
John Marshall.
The manufacturing
economy
Hamilton
constructed
was ringed
by Marshall
with a series
of major
pro-commercial
judicial decisions
that kept
a frustrated
Jefferson
firmly at bay.
and after
Jefferson's
death
a death
that occurred
on the 4th
of July
1826
50 years
to the day
from the adoption
of his
Declaration
of Independence
Monticello
was seized
and sold
to pay
the debts
that only
Thomas Jefferson's
last breath
released him from.
