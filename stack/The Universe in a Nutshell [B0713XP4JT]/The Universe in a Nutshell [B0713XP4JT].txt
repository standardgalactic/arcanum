Random House Audiobooks presents The Universe in a Nutshell by Stephen Hawking.
Read for you by Simon Preble.
I hadn't expected my popular book, A Brief History of Time, to be such a success.
It was on the London Sunday Times bestseller list for over four years, which is longer than any other book has been, and remarkable for a book on science that was not easygoing.
After that, people kept asking when I would write a sequel.
I resisted because I didn't want to write Son of Brief History or A Slightly Longer Brief History of Time, and because I was busy with research.
But I've come to realize that there is room for a different kind of book that might be easier to understand.
A Brief History of Time was organized in a linear fashion, with most chapters following and logically depending on the preceding chapters.
This appealed to some readers, but others got stuck in the early chapters and never reached the more exciting material later on.
By contrast, the present book is more like a tree.
Chapters 1 and 2 form a central trunk, from which the other chapters branch off.
The branches are fairly independent of each other, and can be tackled in any order after the central trunk.
They correspond to areas I've worked on, or thought about, since the publication of A Brief History of Time.
Thus, they present a picture of some of the most active fields of current research.
Within each chapter, I've also tried to avoid a single linear structure.
In 1988, when A Brief History of Time was first published, the ultimate theory of everything seemed to be just over the horizon.
How has the situation changed since then?
Are we any closer to our goal?
As will be described in this book, we have advanced a long way since then.
But it's an ongoing journey still, and the end is not yet in sight.
According to the old saying, it is better to travel, hopefully, than to arrive.
Our quest for discovery fuels our creativity in all fields, not just science.
If we reached the end of the line, the human spirit would shrivel and die.
But I don't think we'll ever stand still.
We shall increase in complexity, if not in depth, and shall always be the centre of an expanding horizon of possibilities.
I want to share my excitement at the discoveries that are being made, and the picture of reality that is emerging.
I've concentrated on areas I've worked on myself for a greater feeling of immediacy.
The details of the work are very technical, but I believe the broad ideas can be conveyed without a lot of mathematical baggage.
I just hope I've succeeded.
I've had a lot of help with this book.
I would mention in particular Thomas Hertog and Neil Shearer, for assistance with the figures, captions, and boxes.
Anne Harris and Kitty Ferguson, who edited the manuscript, or more accurately, the computer files, because everything I write is electronic.
And Philip Dunn of the Book Laboratory and Moonrunner Design, who created the illustrations.
But beyond that, I want to thank all those who have made it possible for me to lead a fairly normal life and carry on scientific research.
Without them, this book could not have been written.

Chapter 1
A Brief History of Relativity
How Einstein Laid the Foundations of the Two Fundamental Theories of the Twentieth Century
General Relativity and Quantum Theory
Albert Einstein, the discoverer of the special and general theories of relativity, was born in Ulm, Germany, in 1879.
But the following year, the family moved to Munich, where his father, Hermann, and uncle, Jakob, set up a small and not very successful electrical business.
Albert was no child prodigy, but claims that he did poorly at school seemed to be an exaggeration.
In 1894, his father's business failed, and the family moved to Milan.
His parents decided he should stay behind to finish school, but he didn't like its authoritarianism, and within months he left to join his family in Italy.
He later completed his education in Zurich, graduating from the prestigious Federal Polytechnical School, known as the ETH, in 1900.
His argumentative nature and dislike of authority did not endear him to the professors at the ETH,
and none of them offered him the position of assistant, which was the normal route to an academic career.
Two years later, he finally managed to get a junior post at the Swiss Patent Office in Bern.
It was while he held this job that, in 1905, he wrote three papers that both established him as one of the world's leading scientists,
and started two conceptual revolutions.
Revolutions that changed our understanding of time, space, and reality itself.
Toward the end of the 19th century, scientists believed they were close to a complete description of the universe.
They imagined that space was filled by a continuous medium called the ether.
Light rays and radio signals were waves in this ether, just as sound as pressure waves in air.
All that was needed for a complete theory were careful measurements of the elastic properties of the ether.
In fact, anticipating such measurements, the Jefferson Lab at Harvard University was built entirely without iron nails,
so as not to interfere with delicate magnetic measurements.
However, the planners forgot that the reddish-brown bricks of which the lab and most of Harvard have built contain large amounts of iron.
The building is still in use today, although Harvard is still not sure how much weight a library floor without iron nails will support.
By the century's end, discrepancies in the idea of an all-pervading ether began to appear.
It was expected that light would travel at a fixed speed through the ether,
but that if you were travelling through the ether in the same direction as the light,
its speed would appear lower,
and if you were travelling in the opposite direction of the light,
its speed would appear higher.
Yet, a series of experiments failed to support this idea.
The most careful and accurate of these experiments was carried out by Albert Michelson and Edward Morley
at the Case School of Applied Science in Cleveland, Ohio, in 1887.
They compared the speed of light in two beams at right angles to each other.
As the Earth rotates on its axis and orbits the Sun,
the apparatus moves through the ether with varying speed and direction.
But Michelson and Morley found no daily or yearly differences between the two beams of light.
It was as if light always travelled at the same speed relative to where one was,
no matter how fast and in which direction one was moving.
Based on the Michelson-Morley experiment,
the Irish physicist George Fitzgerald
and the Dutch physicist Hendrik Lawrence
suggested that bodies moving through the ether would contract
and that clocks would slow down.
This contraction and the slowing down of clocks
would be such that people would all measure the same speed for light,
no matter how they were moving with respect to the ether.
Fitzgerald and Lawrence still regarded ether as a real substance.
However, in a paper written in June 1905,
Einstein pointed out that if one could not detect
whether or not one was moving through space,
the notion of an ether was redundant.
Instead, he started from the postulate
that the laws of science should appear the same to all freely moving observers.
In particular, they should all measure the same speed for light,
no matter how fast they were moving.
The speed of light is independent of their motion
and is the same in all directions.
This required abandoning the idea
that there is a universal quantity called time
that all clocks would measure.
Instead, everyone would have his or her own personal time.
The times of two people would agree
if the people were at rest with respect to each other,
but not if they were moving.
This has been confirmed by a number of experiments,
including one in which two accurate clocks
were flown in opposite directions around the world
and returned, showing very slightly different times.
This might suggest that if one wanted to live longer,
one should keep flying to the east
so that the plane's speed is added to the Earth's rotation.
However, the tiny fraction of a second one would gain
would be more than cancelled by eating airline meals.
In the theory of relativity, each observer has their own measure of time.
This can lead to the so-called twins paradox.
One of a pair of twins leaves on a space journey
during which he travels close to the speed of light,
while his brother remains on Earth.
Because of his motion, time runs more slowly in the spacecraft
as seen by the Earth-bound twin.
So on his return, the space traveller will find that his brother
has aged more than himself.
Although it seems against common sense,
a number of experiments have implied that in this scenario,
the travelling twin would indeed be younger.
A spaceship passes Earth from left to right
at four-fifths the speed of light.
A pulse of light is emitted at one end of the cabin
and reflected at the other end.
The light is observed by people on Earth and on the spaceship.
Because of the motion of the spaceship,
they will disagree about the distance the light has travelled
in reflecting back.
They must, therefore, also disagree about the time the light has taken,
according to Einstein's postulate,
that the speed of light is the same for all freely moving observers.
Einstein's postulate that the laws of nature
should appear the same to all freely moving observers
was the foundation of the theory of relativity.
So-called, because it implied that only relative motion was important.
Its beauty and simplicity convinced many thinkers.
But there remained a lot of opposition.
Einstein had overthrown two of the absolutes of 19th-century science.
Absolute rest, as represented by the ether,
and absolute or universal time, which all clocks would measure.
Many people found this an unsettling concept.
Did it imply, they asked, that everything was relative?
That there were no absolute moral standards?
This unease continued throughout the 1920s and 1930s.
When Einstein was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1921,
the citation was for important but, by his standard,
comparatively minor work also carried out in 1905.
It made no mention of relativity,
which was considered too controversial.
I still get two or three letters a week telling me Einstein was wrong.
Nevertheless, the theory of relativity
is now completely accepted by the scientific community,
and its predictions have been verified in countless applications.
A very important consequence of relativity
is the relation between mass and energy.
Einstein's postulate that the speed of light
should appear the same to everyone
implied that nothing could be moving faster than light.
What happens is that as one uses energy to accelerate anything,
whether a particle or a spaceship,
its mass increases, making it harder to accelerate it further.
To accelerate a particle to the speed of light would be impossible,
because it would take an infinite amount of energy.
Mass and energy are equivalent,
as is summed up in Einstein's famous equation,
E equals mc squared.
This is probably the only equation in physics
to have recognition on the street.
Among its consequences was the realization
that if the nucleus of a uranium atom
fissions into two nuclei with slightly less total mass,
this will release a tremendous amount of energy.
In 1939, as the prospect of another world war loomed,
a group of scientists who realized these implications
persuaded Einstein to overcome his pacifist scruples
and add his authority to a letter to President Roosevelt,
urging the United States to start a program of nuclear research.
This led to the Manhattan Project,
and ultimately to the bombs that exploded
over Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945.
Some people have blamed the atom bomb on Einstein
because he discovered the relationship between mass and energy.
But that's like blaming Newton for causing airplanes to crash
because he discovered gravity.
Einstein himself took no part in the Manhattan Project
and was horrified by the dropping of the bomb.
Einstein's Prophetic Letter to President Roosevelt in 1939
In the course of the last four months,
it has been made probable,
through the work of Joliot in France,
as well as Fermi and Szilard in America,
that it may become possible to set up a nuclear chain reaction
in a large mass of uranium,
by which vast amounts of power
and large quantities of new radium-like elements
would be generated.
Now it appears almost certain
that this could be achieved in the immediate future.
This new phenomenon would also lead to the construction of bombs,
and it is conceivable, though much less certain,
that extremely powerful bombs of a new type
may thus be constructed.
After his groundbreaking papers in 1905,
Einstein's scientific reputation was established.
But it was not until 1909
that he was offered a position at the University of Zurich
that enabled him to leave the Swiss Patent Office.
Two years later,
he moved to the German University in Prague,
but he came back to Zurich in 1912,
this time to the ETH.
Despite the anti-Semitism that was common in much of Europe,
even in the universities,
he was now an academic hot property.
Offers came in from Vienna and Utrecht,
but he chose to accept a research position
with the Prussian Academy of Sciences in Berlin,
because it freed him from teaching duties.
He moved to Berlin in April 1914,
and was joined shortly after by his wife and two sons.
The marriage had been in a bad way for some time, however,
and his family soon returned to Zurich.
Although he visited them occasionally,
he and his wife were eventually divorced.
Einstein later married his cousin Elsa,
who lived in Berlin.
The fact that he spent the war years as a bachelor,
without domestic commitments,
may be one reason why this period
was so productive for him scientifically.
Although the theory of relativity fitted well
with the laws that governed electricity and magnetism,
it was not compatible with Newton's law of gravity.
This law said that if one changed
the distribution of matter in one region of space,
the change in the gravitational field
would be felt instantaneously
everywhere else in the universe.
Not only would this mean
one could send signals faster than light,
something that was forbidden by relativity,
in order to know what instantaneous meant,
it also required the existence
of absolute or universal time,
which relativity had abolished
in favour of personal time.
Einstein was aware of this difficulty in 1907,
while he was still at the patent office in Bern.
But it was not until he was in Prague in 1911
that he began to think seriously about the problem.
He realised that there's a close relationship
between acceleration and a gravitational field.
Someone inside a closed box,
such as an elevator,
could not tell whether the box was at rest
in the Earth's gravitational field,
or was being accelerated by a rocket in free space.
Of course, this was before the age of Star Trek,
and so Einstein thought of people in elevators
rather than spaceships.
But one cannot accelerate or fall freely very far
in an elevator before disaster strikes.
If the Earth were flat,
one could equally well say
that the apple fell on Newton's head
because of gravity,
or because Newton and the surface of the Earth
were accelerating upward.
This equivalence between acceleration and gravity
didn't seem to work for a round Earth, however.
People on the opposite sides of the world
would have to be accelerating in opposite directions,
but staying at a constant distance from each other.
But on his return to Zurich in 1912,
Einstein had the brainwave of realising
that the equivalence would work
if the geometry of space-time was curved and not flat,
as had been assumed hitherto.
His idea was that mass and energy
would warp space-time in some manner yet to be determined.
Objects such as apples or planets
would try to move in straight lines through space-time,
but their paths would appear to be bent
by a gravitational field
because space-time is curved.
With the help of his friend, Marcel Grossmann,
Einstein studied the theory of curved spaces and surfaces
that had been developed earlier by George Friedrich Riemann
as a piece of abstract mathematics.
Riemann had had no thought
that it would be relevant to the real world.
Einstein and Grossmann wrote a joint paper in 1913
in which they put forward the idea
that what we think of as gravitational forces
are just an expression of the fact
that space-time is curved.
However, because of a mistake by Einstein,
who was quite human and fallible,
they weren't able to find the equations
that related the curvature of space-time
to the mass and energy in it.
Einstein continued to work on the problem in Berlin,
undisturbed by domestic matters
and largely unaffected by the war,
until he finally found the right equations
in November 1915.
He had discussed his ideas
with the mathematician David Hilbert
during a visit to the University of Göttingen
in the summer of 1915,
and Hilbert independently found the same equations
a few days before Einstein.
Nevertheless, as Hilbert himself admitted,
the credit for the new theory
belonged to Einstein.
It was his idea to relate gravity
to the warping of space-time.
It's a tribute to the civilised state
of Germany at this period
that such scientific discussions and exchanges
could go on undisturbed even in wartime.
It was a sharp contrast
to the Nazis twenty years later.
The new theory of curved space-time
was called general relativity,
to distinguish it from the original theory
without gravity,
which was now known as special relativity.
It was confirmed in a spectacular fashion
in 1919,
when a British expedition to West Africa
observed a slight bending of light
passing near the sun during an eclipse.
Here was direct evidence
that space and time are warped,
and it spurred the greatest change
in our perception of the universe
in which we live
since Euclid wrote his Elements of Geometry
around 300 BC.
Einstein's general theory of relativity
transformed space and time
from a passive background
in which events take place
to active participants
in the dynamics of the universe.
This led to a great problem
that remains at the forefront of physics
in the 21st century.
The universe is full of matter,
a matter warps space-time
in such a way
that bodies fall together.
Einstein found that his equations
didn't have a solution
that described a static universe
unchanging in time.
Rather than give up
such an everlasting universe,
which he and most other people
believed in,
he funched the equations
by adding a term called
the cosmological constant,
which warps space-time
in the opposite sense,
so that bodies move apart.
The repulsive effect
of the cosmological constant
could balance the attractive effect
of the matter,
thus allowing a static solution
for the universe.
This was one of the great
missed opportunities
of theoretical physics.
If Einstein had stuck
with his original equations,
he could have predicted
that the universe
must be either expanding
or contracting.
As it was,
the possibility
of a time-dependent universe
wasn't taken seriously
until observations
in the 1920s
by the 100-inch telescope
on Mount Wilson.
These observations
revealed that the farther
other galaxies are from us,
the faster they're moving away.
The universe is expanding,
with the distance
between any two galaxies
steadily increasing with time.
This discovery
removed the need
for a cosmological constant
in order to have
a static solution
for the universe.
Einstein later called
the cosmological constant
the greatest mistake
of his life.
However,
it now seems
that it may not have been
a mistake after all.
Recent observations,
described in Chapter 3,
suggest that there may indeed
be a small
cosmological constant.
General relativity
completely changed
the discussion
of the origin
and fate of the universe.
A static universe
could have existed forever
or could have been created
in its present form
at some time in the past.
However,
if galaxies are moving apart now,
it means that they must have been
closer together
in the past.
About 15 billion years ago,
they would all have been
on top of each other,
and the density
would have been very large.
This state was called
the primeval atom
by the Catholic priest
Georges Lemaitre,
who was the first
to investigate
the origin of the universe
that we now call
the Big Bang.
Einstein seems never
to have taken
the Big Bang seriously.
He apparently thought
that the simple model
of a uniformly
expanding universe
would break down
if one followed
the motions of the galaxies
back in time,
and that the small
sideways velocities
of the galaxies
would cause them
to miss each other.
He thought the universe
might have had
a previous contracting phase,
with a bounce
into the present expansion
at a fairly moderate density.
However, we now know
that in order
for nuclear reactions
in the early universe
to produce the amounts
of light elements
we observe around us,
the density must have been
at least 10 tons
per cubic inch,
and the temperature
10 billion degrees.
Further observations
of the microwave background
indicate that the density
was probably once
a trillion, trillion, trillion,
trillion, trillion, trillion,
one with 72 zeros after it,
tons per cubic inch.
We also now know
that Einstein's
general theory of relativity
does not allow
the universe to bounce
from a contracting phase
to the present expansion.
As will be discussed
in Chapter 2,
Roger Penrose and I
were able to show
that general relativity
predicts that the universe
began in the Big Bang.
So Einstein's theory
does imply that time
has a beginning,
although he was never
happy with the idea.
Einstein was even more
reluctant to admit
that general relativity
predicted that time
would come to an end
for massive stars
when they reached
the end of their life
and no longer generated
enough heat to balance
the force of their own gravity,
which was trying
to make them smaller.
Einstein thought
that such stars
would settle down
to some final state,
but we now know
that there are no
final state configurations
for stars of more
than twice the mass
of the sun.
such stars
will continue to shrink
until they become
black holes,
regions of space-time
that are so warped
that light cannot
escape from them.
When a massive star
exhausts its nuclear fuel,
it will lose heat
and contract.
The warping of space-time
will become so great
that a black hole
will be created
from which light
cannot escape.
Inside the black hole,
time will come
to an end.
Penrose and I
showed that
general relativity
predicted that time
would come to an end
inside a black hole,
both for the star
and for any
unfortunate astronaut
who happened
to fall into it.
But both the beginning
and the end of time
would be places
where the equations
of general relativity
could not be defined.
Thus the theory
could not predict
what should emerge
from the Big Bang.
Some saw this
as an indication
of God's freedom
to start the universe off
in any way
God wanted,
but others,
including myself,
felt that the beginning
of the universe
should be governed
by the same laws
that held at other times.
We have made some progress
toward this goal,
as will be described
in Chapter 3,
but we don't yet
have a complete understanding
of the origin
of the universe.
The reason
general relativity
broke down
at the Big Bang
was that it was not
compatible with
quantum theory,
the other great
conceptual revolution
of the early 20th century.
The first step
toward quantum theory
had come in 1900,
when Max Planck
in Berlin
discovered that
the radiation
from a body
that was glowing red hot
was explainable
if light could be emitted
or absorbed,
only if it came
in discrete packets
called quanta.
In one of his
groundbreaking papers,
written in 1905,
when he was at
the patent office,
Einstein showed
that Planck's
quantum hypothesis
could explain
what is called
the photoelectric effect,
the way certain metals
give off electrons
when light falls on them.
This is the basis
of modern light detectors
and television cameras,
and it was for this work
that Einstein
was awarded
the Nobel Prize
for Physics.
Einstein continued
to work on the quantum idea
into the 1920s,
but he was deeply disturbed
by the work
of Werner Heisenberg
in Copenhagen,
Paul Dirac
in Cambridge,
and Erwin Schrodinger
in Zurich,
who developed
a new picture
of reality
called quantum mechanics.
No longer
did tiny particles
have a definite
position and speed.
Instead,
the more accurately
one determined
a particle's position,
the less accurately
one could determine
its speed,
and vice versa.
Einstein was horrified
by this random,
unpredictable element
in the basic laws,
and never fully accepted
quantum mechanics.
His feelings
were expressed
in his famous dictum,
God does not play dice.
Most other scientists,
however,
accepted the validity
of the new quantum laws
because of the explanations
they gave
for a whole range
of previously
unaccounted-for phenomena,
and their excellent agreement
with observations.
They are the basis
of modern developments
in chemistry,
molecular biology,
and electronics,
and the foundation
for the technology
that has transformed
the world
in the last 50 years.
In December 1932,
aware that the Nazis
and Hitler
were about to come to power,
Einstein left Germany
and four months later
renounced his citizenship,
spending the last 20 years
of his life
at the Institute
for Advanced Study
in Princeton, New Jersey.
In Germany,
the Nazis launched
a campaign
against Jewish science
and the many German scientists
who were Jews.
This is part of the reason
that Germany
was not able
to build an atomic bomb.
Einstein and relativity
were principal targets
of this campaign.
When told of the publication
of a book entitled
100 Authors Against Einstein,
he replied,
Why 100?
If I were wrong,
one would have been enough.
After the Second World War,
he urged the Allies
to set up a world government
to control the atomic bomb.
In 1948,
he was offered
the presidency
of the new state of Israel,
but turned it down.
He once said,
Politics is for the moment,
but an equation
is for eternity.
The Einstein equations
of general relativity
are his best epitaph
and memorial.
They should last
as long as the universe.
The world has changed
far more
in the last hundred years
than in any previous century.
The reason
has not been
new political
or economic doctrines,
but the vast developments
in technology
made possible
by advances
in basic science.
Who better symbolizes
those advances
than Albert Einstein?
Chapter 2
The Shape of Time
Einstein's general relativity
gives time a shape.
How this can be reconciled
with quantum theory.
What is time?
Is it an ever-rolling stream
that bears all our dreams away,
as the old hymn says?
Or is it a railroad track?
Maybe it has loops
and branches,
so you can keep going forward
and yet return
to an earlier station
on the line.
The nineteenth-century author
Charles Lamb wrote,
Nothing puzzles me
like time and space,
and yet,
nothing troubles me less
than time and space,
because I never think of them.
Most of us don't worry
about time and space
most of the time,
whatever that may be,
but we all do wonder
sometimes
what time is,
how it began,
and where it is leading us.
Any sound scientific theory,
whether of time
or of any other concept,
should, in my opinion,
be based on the most
workable philosophy of science.
The positivist approach
put forward by
Karl Popper and others.
According to this way
of thinking,
a scientific theory
is a mathematical model
that describes and codifies
the observations we make.
A good theory
will describe
a large range of phenomena
on the basis
of a few simple postulates,
and will make definite predictions
that can be tested.
If the predictions
agree with the observations,
the theory survives that test,
though it can never be proved
to be correct.
On the other hand,
if the observations
disagree with the predictions,
one has to discard
or modify the theory.
At least,
that is what is supposed
to happen.
In practice,
people often question
the accuracy
of the observations,
and the reliability
and moral character
of those making
the observations.
If one takes
the positivist position,
as I do,
one cannot say
what time actually is.
All one can do
is describe
what has been found
to be a very good
mathematical model
for time
and say what predictions
it makes.
Isaac Newton
gave us the first
mathematical model
for time and space
in his Principia Mathematica,
published in 1687.
Newton occupied
the Luccasian chair
at Cambridge
that I now hold,
though it wasn't
electrically operated
in his time.
In Newton's model,
time and space
were a background
in which events
took place,
but which wasn't
affected by them.
Time was separate
from space
and was considered
to be a single line
or railroad track
that was infinite
in both directions.
Time itself
was considered eternal
in the sense
that it had existed
and would exist
forever.
By contrast,
most people thought
the physical universe
had been created
more or less
in its present state
only a few thousand
years ago.
This worried philosophers
such as the German thinker
Immanuel Kant.
If the universe
had indeed been created,
why had there been
an infinite weight
before the creation?
On the other hand,
if the universe
had existed forever,
why hadn't everything
that was going to happen
already happened,
meaning that history
was over?
In particular,
why hadn't the universe
reached thermal equilibrium
with everything
at the same temperature?
Kant called this problem
an antimony
of pure reason,
because it seemed
to be a logical
contradiction.
It didn't have
a resolution.
But it was a contradiction
only within the context
of the Newtonian
mathematical model,
in which time
was an infinite line,
independent of what
was happening
in the universe.
However,
as we saw in Chapter 1,
in 1915,
a completely new
mathematical model
was put forward
by Einstein,
the general theory
of relativity.
In the years
since Einstein's paper,
we've added a few
ribbons and bows,
but our model
of time and space
is still based
on what Einstein
proposed.
This,
and the following chapters,
would describe
how our ideas
have developed
in the years
since Einstein's
revolutionary paper.
It has been
a success story
of the work
of a large number
of people,
and I'm proud
to have made
a small contribution.
General relativity
combines the time
dimension
with the three dimensions
of space
to form what is called
space-time.
The theory incorporates
the effect of gravity
by saying that
the distribution
of matter and energy
in the universe
warps and distorts
space-time
so that it's not flat.
Objects in this space-time
try to move
in straight lines,
but because space-time
is curved,
their paths
appear bent.
They move
as if affected
by a gravitational field.
As a rough analogy,
not to be taken
too literally,
imagine a sheet
of rubber.
One can place
a large ball
on the sheet
to represent the sun.
The weight of the ball
will depress the sheet
and cause it
to be curved
near the sun.
If one now rolls
little ball bearings
on the sheet,
they won't roll
straight across
to the other side,
but instead
will go around
the heavy weight,
like planets
orbiting the sun.
The analogy
is incomplete
because in it
only a two-dimensional
section of space,
the surface
of the rubber sheet
is curved
and time
is left undisturbed
as it is
in Newtonian theory.
However,
in the theory
of relativity,
which agrees
with a large number
of experiments,
time and space
are inextricably
tangled up.
One cannot curve space
without involving
time as well.
Thus,
time has a shape.
By curving space
and time,
general relativity
changes them
from being
a passive background
against which events
take place
to being active
dynamic participants
in what happens.
In Newtonian theory,
where time existed
independently
of anything else,
one could ask,
what did God do
before he created
the universe?
As St. Augustine said,
one should not joke
about this,
as did a man
who said,
he was preparing
hell for those
who pry too deep.
It is a serious
question that people
have pondered
down the ages.
According to St. Augustine,
before God made
heaven and earth,
he didn't make
anything at all.
In fact,
this is very close
to modern ideas.
On the other hand,
in general relativity,
time and space
do not exist
independently
of the universe
or of each other.
They are defined
by measurements
within the universe,
such as the number
of vibrations
of a quartz crystal
in a clock
or the length
of a ruler.
It is quite conceivable
that time defined
in this way
within the universe
should have
a minimum
or maximum value.
In other words,
a beginning
or an end.
It would make no sense
to ask what happened
before the beginning
or after the end
because such times
would not be defined.
It was clearly
important to decide
whether the mathematical
model of general
relativity
predicted that
the universe
and time itself
should have
a beginning
or end.
The general prejudice
among theoretical
physicists,
including Einstein,
held that time
should be infinite
in both directions.
Otherwise,
there were awkward
questions about
the creation
of the universe
which seemed to be
outside the realm
of science.
Solutions of the
Einstein equations
were known
in which time
had a beginning
or end,
but these were all
very special
with a large amount
of symmetry.
It was thought
that in a real body,
collapsing under
its own gravity,
pressure or
sideways velocities
would prevent
all the matter
falling together
to the same point.
where the density
would be infinite.
Similarly,
if one traced
the expansion
of the universe
back in time,
one would find
that the matter
of the universe
didn't all emerge
from a point
of infinite density.
Such a point
of infinite density
was called
a singularity
and would be
a beginning
or an end
of time.
In 1963,
two Russian scientists,
Yevgeny Lifshitz
and Isaac Galaknikov,
claimed to have proved
that solutions
of the Einstein equations
with a singularity
all had a special
arrangement of matter
and velocities.
The chances
that the solution
representing the universe
would have this special
arrangement
were practically zero.
Almost all solutions
that could represent
the universe
would avoid
having a singularity
of infinite density.
Before the era
during which
the universe
has been expanding,
there must have been
a previous
contracting phase
during which matter
fell together
but missed colliding
with itself,
moving apart again
in the present
expanding phase.
If this were the case,
time would continue
on forever
from the infinite past
to the infinite future.
Not everyone
was convinced
by the arguments
of Lifshitz
and Galaknikov.
Instead,
Roger Penrose
and I
adopted a different
approach
based not on
a detailed study
of solutions
but on the global
structure of space-time.
In general relativity,
space-time is curved
not only by massive
objects in it
but also by the energy
in it.
Energy is always
positive
so it gives space-time
a curvature
that bends the paths
of light rays
toward each other.
Now consider
our past
light cone,
that is,
the paths
through space-time
of the light rays
from distant galaxies
that reach us
at the present time.
In a diagram
with time
plotted upward
and space
plotted sideways,
this is a cone
with its vertex
or point
at us.
As we go
toward the past,
down the cone
from the vertex,
we see galaxies
at earlier
and earlier times.
Because the universe
has been expanding
and everything
used to be
much closer together,
as we look back
further,
we're looking
back through
regions of
higher matter
density.
We observe
a faint background
of microwave
radiation
that propagates
to us
along our
past light cone
from a much
earlier time,
when the universe
was much denser
and hotter
than it is now.
By tuning receivers
to different frequencies
of microwaves,
we can measure
the spectrum,
the distribution
of power
arranged by frequency,
of this radiation.
We find a spectrum
that is characteristic
of radiation
from a body
at a temperature
of 2.7 degrees
above absolute zero.
This microwave
radiation
is not much good
for defrosting
frozen pizza,
but the fact
that the spectrum
agrees so exactly
with that of radiation
from a body
at 2.7 degrees
tells us
that the radiation
must have come
from regions
that are opaque
to microwaves.
Thus,
we can conclude
that our past
light cone
must pass through
a certain amount
of matter
as one follows
it back.
This amount
of matter
is enough
to curve space-time
so that the light rays
in our past light cone
are bent back
toward each other.
As one goes back
in time,
the cross-sections
of our past light cone
reach a maximum size
and begin to get
smaller again.
Our past
is pear-shaped.
As one follows
our past light cone
back still further,
the positive energy
density of matter
causes the light rays
to bend toward each other
more strongly.
The cross-section
of the light cone
will shrink to zero size
in a finite time.
This means
that all the matter
inside our past light cone
is trapped
in a region
whose boundary
shrinks to zero.
It's therefore
not very surprising
that Penrose and I
could prove
that in the mathematical model
of general relativity,
time must have a beginning
in what is called
the Big Bang.
Similar arguments
show that time
would have an end
when stars or galaxies
collapse under their own gravity
to form black holes.
We had sidestepped
Kant's antimony
of pure reason
by dropping
his implicit assumption
that time
had a meaning
independent of the universe.
Our paper,
proving time
had a beginning,
won the second prize
in the competition
sponsored by
the Gravity Research Foundation
in 1968,
and Roger and I
shared the princely sum
of $300.
I don't think
the other prize essays
of that year
have shown
much enduring value.
There were various reactions
to our work.
It upset many physicists,
but it delighted
those religious leaders
who believed
in an act of creation,
for here
was scientific proof.
Meanwhile,
Lifshitz and Kalatnikov
were in an awkward position.
They couldn't argue
with the mathematical theorems
that we'd proved,
but under the Soviet system,
they couldn't admit
that they'd been wrong
and Western science
had been right.
However,
they saved the situation
by finding a more general
family of solutions
with a singularity,
which weren't special
in the way
their previous solutions
had been.
This enabled them
to claim singularities
and the beginning
or end of time
as a Soviet discovery.
Most physicists
still instinctively
dislike the idea
of time
having a beginning
or end.
They therefore
pointed out
that the mathematical model
might be expected
not to be a good description
of space-time
nearer singularity.
The reason is
that general relativity,
which describes
the gravitational force,
is a classical theory,
as noted in Chapter 1,
and does not incorporate
the uncertainty
of quantum theory
that governs
all other forces we know.
This inconsistency
doesn't matter
in most of the universe
most of the time,
because the scale
on which space-time
is curved
is very large,
and the scale
on which quantum effects
are important,
is very small.
But nearer singularity,
the two scales
would be comparable,
and quantum gravitational effects
would be important.
So what the singularity theorems
of Penrose
and myself
really established
is that our classical region
of space-time
is bounded
to the past
and possibly
to the future
by regions
in which quantum gravity
is important.
To understand
the origin
and fate
of the universe,
we need
a quantum theory
of gravity,
and this will be
the subject
of most of this book.
An important step
in the discovery
of quantum theory
was Max Planck's
suggestion in 1900
that light
always comes
in little packets
he called quanta.
But while Planck's
quantum hypothesis
clearly explained
observations
of the rate of radiation
from hot bodies,
the full extent
of its implications
wasn't realized
until the mid-1920s
when the German physicist
Werner Heisenberg
formulated his famous
uncertainty principle.
He noted that
Planck's hypothesis
implies that
the more accurately
one tries to measure
the position of a particle,
the less accurately
one can measure its speed
and vice versa.
More precisely,
he showed that
the uncertainty
in the position
of a particle
times the uncertainty
in its momentum
must always be larger
than Planck's constant,
which is a quantity
that's closely related
to the energy content
of one quantum of light.
The Maxwell Field
In 1865,
the British physicist
James Clerk Maxwell
combined all the known
laws of electricity
and magnetism.
Maxwell's theory
rests on the existence
of fields
that transmit actions
from one place
to another.
He recognized
that the fields
that transmit electric
and magnetic disturbances
are dynamical entities.
They can oscillate
and move through space.
Maxwell's synthesis
of electromagnetism
can be condensed
into two equations
that prescribe
the dynamics
of these fields.
He himself derived
the first great conclusion
from these equations,
that electromagnetic waves
of all frequencies
travel through space
at the same fixed speed,
the speed of light.
Quantum theories
of systems such as atoms,
with a finite number
of particles,
were formulated
in the 1920s
by Heisenberg,
Schrodinger,
and Dirac.
Dirac was another
previous holder
of my chair in Cambridge,
but it still
wasn't motorized.
However,
people encountered
difficulties
when they tried
to extend quantum ideas
to the Maxwell Field,
which describes
electricity,
magnetism,
and light.
One can think
of the Maxwell Field
as being made up
of waves
of different wavelengths,
the distance between
one wave crest
and the next.
In a wave,
the field will swing
from one value
to another
like a pendulum.
According to quantum theory,
the ground state,
or lowest energy state
of a pendulum,
is not just sitting
at the lowest energy point,
pointing straight down.
That would have
both a definite position
and a definite velocity,
zero.
This would be a violation
of the uncertainty principle,
which forbids
the precise measurement
of both position
and velocity
at the same time.
The uncertainty
in the position,
multiplied by the uncertainty
in the momentum,
must be greater
than a certain quantity,
known as Planck's constant,
a number that's too long
to keep writing down,
so we use a symbol for it.
So,
the ground state,
or lowest energy state,
of a pendulum
does not have zero energy,
as one might expect.
Instead,
even in its ground state,
a pendulum,
or any oscillating system,
must have a certain
minimum amount
of what are called
zero-point fluctuations.
These mean
that the pendulum
won't necessarily
be pointing straight down,
but will also have
a probability
of being found
at a small angle
to the vertical.
Similarly,
even in the vacuum,
or lowest energy state,
the waves
in the Maxwell field
won't be exactly zero,
but can have small sizes.
The higher the frequency,
the number of swings
per minute of the pendulum,
or wave,
the higher the energy
of the ground state.
Calculations of the
ground state fluctuations
in the Maxwell
and electron fields
made the apparent mass
and charge
of the electron
infinite,
which is not
what observations show.
However,
in the 1940s,
the physicists
Richard Feynman,
Julian Schwinger,
and Shinichiro Tomonaga
developed a consistent
way of removing
or subtracting out
these infinities
and dealing only
with the finite
observed values
of the mass
and charge.
Nevertheless,
the ground state
fluctuations still
caused small effects
that could be measured,
and that agreed well
with the experiment.
Similar subtraction schemes
for removing infinities
worked for the
Yang-Mills field
in the theory
put forward
by Chenning Yang
and Robert Mills.
Yang-Mills theory
is an extension
of Maxwell theory
that describes
interactions
in two other forces
called the weak
and strong nuclear forces.
However,
ground state fluctuations
have a much more
serious effect
in a quantum theory
of gravity.
Again,
each wavelength
would have a
ground state energy.
Since there is no limit
to how short
the wavelengths
of the Maxwell field
can be,
there are an infinite
number of different
wavelengths in any
region of space-time
and an infinite amount
of ground state energy.
Because energy density
is, like matter,
a source of gravity,
this infinite energy density
ought to mean
there is enough
gravitational attraction
in the universe
to curl space-time
into a single point,
which obviously
hasn't happened.
One might hope
to solve the problem
of this seeming contradiction
between observation
and theory
by saying that
the ground state fluctuations
have no gravitational effect,
but this wouldn't work.
One can detect
the energy of ground state
fluctuations
by the Casimir effect.
If you place
a pair of metal plates
parallel to each other
and close together,
the effect of the plates
is to reduce slightly
the number of wavelengths
that fit between the plates
relative to the number
outside.
This means
that the energy density
of ground state fluctuations
between the plates,
although still infinite,
is less than the energy density
outside
by a finite amount.
This difference
in energy density
gives rise to a force
pulling the plates together,
and this force
has been observed experimentally.
Forces are a source
of gravity
in general relativity
just as matter is,
so it would not be consistent
to ignore
the gravitational effect
of this energy difference.
Another possible solution
to the problem
might be to suppose
there was a cosmological constant,
such as Einstein introduced,
in an attempt
to have a static model
of the universe.
If this constant
had an infinite negative value,
it could exactly cancel
the infinite positive value
of the ground state energies
in free space.
But this cosmological constant
seems very ad hoc,
and it would have to be tuned
to extraordinary accuracy.
Fortunately,
a totally new kind of symmetry
was discovered
in the 1970s
that provides
a natural physical mechanism
to cancel the infinities
arising from ground state fluctuations.
supersymmetry
is a feature
of our modern mathematical models
that can be described
in various ways.
One way
is to say
that space-time
has extra dimensions,
besides the dimensions
we experience.
These are called
Grassmann dimensions
because they're measured
in numbers
known as Grassmann variables
rather than
in ordinary real numbers.
Ordinary numbers commute.
That is,
it doesn't matter
in which order
you multiply them.
6 times 4
is the same
as 4 times 6.
But Grassmann variables
anti-commute.
x times y
is the same
as negative y
times x.
Supersymmetry
was first considered
for removing infinities
in matter fields
and Yang-Mills fields
in a space-time
where both
the ordinary number dimensions
and the Grassmann dimensions
were flat,
not curved.
But it was natural
to extend it
to ordinary numbers
and Grassmann dimensions
that were curved.
This led to a number
of theories called
supergravity,
with different amounts
of supersymmetry.
One consequence
of supersymmetry
is that every field
or particle
should have
a superpartner
with a spin
that is either
one-half greater
than its own
or one-half less.
Spin of Particle
All particles
have a property
called spin,
having to do
with what the particle
looks like
from different directions.
One can illustrate this
with a pack
of playing cards.
Consider first
the Ace of Spades.
This looks the same
only if you turn it
through a complete revolution
or 360 degrees.
It is therefore said
to have spin one.
On the other hand,
the Queen of Hearts
has two heads.
It is therefore
the same
under only half a revolution,
180 degrees.
It is said
to have spin two.
Similarly,
one could imagine
objects with spin three
or higher
that would look the same
under smaller fractions
of a revolution.
The higher the spin,
the smaller the fraction
of a complete revolution
necessary to have
the particle look the same.
But the remarkable fact is
that there are particles
that look the same
only if you turn them
through two complete revolutions.
Such particles
are said to have spin one-half.
The ground-state energies
of bosons,
fields whose spin
is a whole number,
zero, one, two, etc.,
are positive.
On the other hand,
the ground-state energies
of fermions,
fields whose spin
is a half number,
one-half, three-halves, etc.,
are negative.
Because there are equal numbers
of bosons and fermions,
the biggest infinities
cancel in supergravity theories.
Superpartners
All known particles
in the universe
belong to one of two groups,
fermions or bosons.
Fermions are particles
with half-integer spin,
such as spin one-half,
and they make up
ordinary matter.
Their ground-state energies
are negative.
Bosons are particles
with integer spin,
such as zero, one, two,
and these give rise to forces
between the fermions,
such as the gravitational force
and light.
Their ground-state energies
are positive.
Supergravity theory
supposes that every fermion
and every boson
has a superpartner
with a spin that is either
one-half greater than its own
or one-half less.
For example,
a photon,
which is a boson,
has a spin of one.
Its ground-state energy
is positive.
The photon's superpartner,
the photino,
has a spin of one-half,
making it a fermion.
Hence,
its ground-state energy
is negative.
In this supergravity scheme,
we end up with equal numbers
of bosons and fermions.
With the ground-state energies
of the bosons weighing in
on the positive side
and the fermions weighing in
on the negative side,
the ground-state energies
cancel one another out,
eliminating the biggest infinities.
There remained the possibility
that there might be smaller
but still infinite quantities
left over.
No one had the patience
needed to calculate
whether these theories
were actually completely finite.
It was reckoned
it would take a good student
two hundred years,
and how would you know
he hadn't made a mistake
on the second page?
Still, up to 1985,
most people believed
that most supersymmetric
supergravity theories
would be free of infinities.
Then suddenly,
the fashion changed.
People declared
there was no reason
not to expect infinities
in supergravity theories,
and this was taken to mean
they were fatally flawed
as theories.
Instead,
it was claimed
that a theory named
supersymmetric string theory
was the only way
to combine gravity
with quantum theory.
Strings,
like their namesakes
in everyday experience,
are one-dimensional
extended objects.
They have only length.
Strings in string theory
move through
a background space-time.
Ripples on the string
are interpreted
as particles.
String oscillations
In string theory,
the basic objects
are not particles,
which occupy
a single point in space,
but one-dimensional strings.
These strings
may have ends,
or they may join up
with themselves
in closed loops.
Just like the strings
on a violin,
the strings in string theory
support certain
resonant vibrational patterns,
or resonant frequencies,
whose wavelengths
fit precisely
between the two ends.
But while the different
resonant frequencies
of a violin's strings
give rise to
different musical notes,
the different oscillations
of a string
give rise to
different masses
and force charges,
which are interpreted
as fundamental particles.
Roughly speaking,
the shorter the wavelength
of the oscillation
on the string,
the greater the mass
of the particle.
If the strings
have grass mound dimensions,
as well as their
ordinary number dimensions,
the ripples will correspond
to bosons and fermions.
In this case,
the positive and negative
ground state energies
will cancel so exactly
that there will be
no infinities
even of the smaller sort.
Superstrings,
it was claimed,
were the TOE,
the theory of everything.
Historians of science
in the future
will find it interesting
to chart the changing
tide of opinion
among theoretical physicists.
For a few years,
strings reigned supreme
and supergravity
was dismissed
as just an approximate theory
valid at low energy.
The qualification,
low energy,
was considered
particularly damning,
even though in this context
low energies
meant particles
with energies
of less than a billion,
billion times
those of particles
in a TNT explosion.
If supergravity
was only a low energy
approximation,
it could not claim
to be the fundamental
theory of the universe.
Instead,
the underlying theory
was supposed to be
one of five possible
superstring theories.
But which of the
five-string theories
described our universe?
And how could string theory
be formulated
beyond the approximation
in which strings
were pictured as
surfaces with
one space dimension
and one time dimension
moving through
a flat background space-time?
Wouldn't the strings
curve the background space-time?
In the years after 1985,
it gradually became apparent
that string theory
wasn't the complete picture.
To start with,
it was realised
that strings
are just one member
of a wide class
of objects
that can be extended
in more than one dimension.
Paul Townsend,
who, like me,
is a member
of the Department
of Applied Mathematics
and Theoretical Physics
at Cambridge,
and who did much
of the fundamental work
on these objects,
gave them the name
P-brains.
That's P-dash-B-R-A-N-E-S.
A P-brain
has length
in P-directions.
Thus,
a P equals one brain
is a string.
A P equals two brain
is a surface
or membrane,
and so on.
There seems to be
no reason to favour
the P equals one string case
over other possible
values of P.
Instead,
we should adopt
the principle
of P-brain democracy.
All P-brains
are created equal.
All the P-brains
could be found
as solutions
of the equations
of supergravity theories
in ten or eleven dimensions.
While ten or eleven dimensions
doesn't sound much
like the space-time
we experience,
the idea was
that the other
six or seven dimensions
are curled up so small
that we don't notice them.
We're only aware
of the remaining
four large
and nearly flat dimensions.
I must say
that personally,
I've been reluctant
to believe
in extra dimensions,
but as I'm a positivist,
the question
do extra dimensions
really exist
has no meaning.
All one can ask is
whether mathematical models
with extra dimensions
provide a good description
of the universe.
We don't yet
have any observations
that require
extra dimensions
for their explanation.
However,
there is a possibility
we may observe them
in the Large Hadron Collider
in Geneva.
But what has convinced
many people,
including myself,
that one should take models
with extra dimensions
seriously,
is that there is
a web of unexpected
relationships
called dualities
between the models.
These dualities
show that the models
are all essentially
equivalent.
That is,
they are just
different aspects
of the same underlying theory,
which has been given
the name M-theory.
Not to take this
web of dualities
as a sign
we're on the right track
would be a bit like
believing that God
put fossils
into the rocks
in order to
mislead Darwin
about the evolution
of life.
These dualities
show that the five
superstring theories
all describe
the same physics
and that they're also
physically equivalent
to supergravity.
One cannot say
that superstrings
are more fundamental
than supergravity
or vice versa.
Rather,
they are different
expressions
of the same
underlying theory,
each useful
for calculations
in different kinds
of situations.
Because string theories
don't have any
infinities,
they're good
for calculating
what happens
when a few
high-energy particles
collide and scatter
off each other.
However,
they are not of much
use for describing
how the energy
of a very large
number of particles
curves the universe
or forms a bound
state,
like a black hole.
For these situations,
one needs supergravity,
which is basically
Einstein's theory
of curved spacetime
with some extra
kinds of matter.
It is this picture
that I shall mainly
use in what follows.
To describe how
quantum theory
shapes time and space,
it's helpful to
introduce the idea
of imaginary time.
Imaginary time
sounds like something
from science fiction,
but it's a well-defined
mathematical concept.
Time measured
in what are called
imaginary numbers.
One can think
of ordinary real numbers
such as 1, 2,
negative 3.5,
and so on,
as corresponding
to positions on a line
stretching from left
to right.
Zero in the middle,
positive real numbers
on the right,
and negative real numbers
on the left.
Imaginary numbers
can then be represented
as corresponding
to positions
on a vertical line.
Zero is again
in the middle,
positive imaginary numbers
plotted upward,
and negative imaginary numbers
plotted downward.
Thus,
imaginary numbers
can be thought of
as a new kind
of number
at right angles
to ordinary real numbers.
Because they are
a mathematical construct,
they don't need
a physical realization.
One can't have
an imaginary number
of oranges
or an imaginary
credit card bill.
One might think
this means
that imaginary numbers
are just a mathematical game,
having nothing to do
with the real world.
From the viewpoint
of positivist philosophy,
however,
one cannot determine
what is real.
All one can do
is find
which mathematical models
describe the universe
we live in.
It turns out
that a mathematical model
involving imaginary time
predicts not only effects
we have already observed,
but also effects
we have not been able
to measure,
yet nevertheless believe in
for other reasons.
So,
what is real
and what is imaginary?
Is the distinction
just in our minds?
Einstein's classical,
that is,
non-quantum,
general theory
of relativity
combined real time
and the three dimensions
of space
into a four-dimensional
space-time.
But the real-time direction
was distinguished
from the three
spatial directions.
The world line
or history of an observer
always increased
in the real-time direction,
that is,
time always moved
from past to future,
but it could increase
or decrease
in any of the three
spatial directions.
In other words,
one could reverse
direction in space,
but not in time.
On the other hand,
because imaginary time
is at right angles
to real time,
it behaves like
a fourth spatial direction.
It can therefore have
a much richer range
of possibilities
than the railroad track
of ordinary real time,
which can only have
a beginning or an end
or go around in circles.
It is in this imaginary sense
that time has a shape.
To see some of the possibilities,
consider an imaginary
time-space-time
that is a sphere,
like the surface
of the Earth.
Suppose that imaginary time
was degrees of latitude.
Then,
the history of the universe
in imaginary time
would begin
at the South Pole.
It would make no sense
to ask
what happened
before the beginning.
Such times
are simply not defined
any more than
there are points
south of the South Pole.
The South Pole
is a perfectly regular point
of the Earth's surface,
and the same laws
hold there
as at other points.
This suggests
that the beginning
of the universe
in imaginary time
can be a regular point
of space-time,
and that the same laws
can hold at the beginning
as in the rest
of the universe.
The quantum origin
and evolution
of the universe
will be discussed
in the next chapter.
Another possible behaviour
is illustrated
by taking imaginary time
to be degrees
of longitude
on the Earth.
All the lines
of longitude
meet at the North
and South Poles.
Thus,
time stands still there
in the sense
that an increase
of imaginary time
or of degrees
of longitude
leaves one
in the same spot.
This is very similar
to the way
that ordinary time
appears to stand still
on the horizon
of a black hole.
We've come to recognise
that this standing still
of real and imaginary time
either both stand still
or neither does
means that the space-time
has a temperature,
as I discovered
for black holes.
Not only does a black hole
have a temperature,
it also behaves
as if it has a quantity
called entropy.
The entropy
is a measure
of the number
of internal states,
ways it could be
configured on the inside,
that the black hole
could have
without looking any different
to an outside observer,
who can only observe
its mass,
rotation,
and charge.
The black hole entropy
is given by a very simple formula
I discovered in 1974.
It equals the area
of the horizon
of the black hole.
There is one bit
of information
about the internal state
of the black hole
for each fundamental unit
of area of the horizon.
This shows
that there is
a deep connection
between quantum gravity
and thermodynamics,
the science of heat,
which includes
the study of entropy.
It also suggests
that quantum gravity
may exhibit
what is called
holography.
Holography is essentially
a phenomenon
of interference
of wave patterns.
holograms are created
when the light
from a single laser
is split into
two separate beams.
One bounces off the object
onto a photosensitized plate,
the other
passes through a lens
and collides
with the reflected light
of the first beam,
creating an interference
pattern on the plate.
When a laser
is shone through
the developed plate,
a fully three-dimensional image
of the original object
appears.
An observer
can move around
this holographic image,
being able to see
all the hidden faces
that a normal photo
couldn't show.
The two-dimensional surface
of the plate,
unlike a normal photo,
has the remarkable property
that any tiny fragment
of its surface
contains all the information
needed to reconstruct
the whole image.
Information about
the quantum states
in a region of space-time
may be somehow coded
on the boundary
of the region,
which has two dimensions less.
This is like the way
that a hologram
carries a three-dimensional image
on a two-dimensional surface.
If quantum gravity
incorporates
the holographic principle,
it may mean
that we can keep track
of what is inside black holes.
This is essential
if we are to be able
to predict the radiation
that comes out of black holes.
If we can't do that,
we won't be able
to predict the future
as fully as we thought.
This is discussed
in Chapter 4.
In Chapter 5,
I consider the question
of whether the past
is fixed
or whether it can be changed
by someone warping
space-time so much
that he or she
can travel back in time.
However, it seems
there may be
a chronology protection principle
that prevents such warping
and makes the universe
safe for historians.
The holographic principle
The realization
that the surface area
of the horizon
surrounding a black hole
measures the black hole's entropy
has led people
to advocate
that the maximum entropy
of any closed region
of space
can never exceed
a quarter of the area
of the circumscribing surface.
Since entropy
is nothing more
than a measure
of the total information
contained in a system,
this suggests
that the information
associated with all phenomena
in the three-dimensional world
can be stored
on its two-dimensional boundary,
like a holographic image.
In a certain sense,
the world
would be two-dimensional.
Chapter 3
The Universe
in a Nutshell
The universe
has multiple histories,
each of which
is determined
by a tiny nut.
I could be bounded
in a nutshell
and count myself
a king
of infinite space.
Shakespeare
Hamlet
Act 2
Scene 2
Hamlet may have meant
that although
we human beings
are very limited physically,
our minds
are free to explore
the whole universe
and to go boldly
where even
Star Trek
fears to tread,
bad dreams permitting.
Is the universe
actually infinite
or just
very large?
And is it everlasting
or just long-lived?
How could our finite minds
comprehend
an infinite universe?
Isn't it presumptuous
of us
even to make the attempt?
Do we risk
the fate of Prometheus
who in classical mythology
stole fire from Zeus
for human beings
to use
and was punished
for his temerity
by being chained
to a rock
where an eagle
picked at his liver?
Despite this
cautionary tale,
I believe we can
and should
try to understand
the universe.
We have already
made remarkable progress
in understanding
the cosmos,
particularly in the
last few years.
We don't yet have
a complete picture,
but this may not
be far off.
The most obvious
thing about space
is that it goes
on and on
and on.
This has been
confirmed by
modern instruments
such as the Hubble
Telescope,
which allows us
to probe deep
into space.
What we see
are billions
and billions
of galaxies
of various shapes
and sizes.
Each galaxy
contains uncounted
billions of stars,
many of which
have planets
around them.
We live on a planet
orbiting a star
in an outer arm
of the spiral
Milky Way galaxy.
The dust
in the spiral arms
blocks our view
of the universe
in the plane
of the galaxy,
but we have
a clear line of sight
in cones of directions
on each side
of the plane,
and we can plot
the positions
of distant galaxies.
We find
that the galaxies
are distributed
roughly uniformly
throughout space,
with some local
concentrations and voids.
The density
of galaxies
appears to drop off
at very large distances,
but that seems to be
because they're so far
away and faint
that we can't
make them out.
As far as we can tell,
the universe
goes on in space
forever.
Although the universe
seems to be much
the same
at each position
in space,
it is definitely
changing in time.
And this wasn't
realized until the
early years
of the 20th century.
Up to then,
it was thought
the universe
was essentially
constant in time.
It might have existed
for an infinite time,
but that seemed
to lead to
absurd conclusions.
If stars
had been radiating
for an infinite time,
they would have
heated up the universe
to their temperature.
Even at night,
the whole sky
would be as bright
as the sun,
because every line
of sight would end
either on a star
or on a cloud
of dust that had
been heated up
until it was
as hot as the stars.
The observation
that we've all made
that the sky
at night is dark
is very important.
It implies
that the universe
cannot have existed
forever in the state
we see today.
Something must have
happened in the past
to make the stars
light up
a finite time ago,
which means
that the light
from very distant stars
has not had time
to reach us yet.
This would explain
why the sky at night
isn't glowing
in every direction.
If the stars
had just been
sitting there forever,
why did they
suddenly light up
a few billion years ago?
What was the clock
that told them
it was time to shine?
As we've seen,
this puzzled
those philosophers,
much like Immanuel Kant,
who believed
that the universe
had existed forever.
But for most people,
it was consistent
with the idea
that the universe
had been created,
much as it is now,
only a few thousand
years ago.
However,
discrepancies
with this idea
began to appear
with the observations
by Vesto Slipher
and Edwin Hubble
in the second decade
of the 20th century.
In 1923,
Hubble discovered
that many faint patches
of light,
called nebulae,
were in fact
other galaxies,
vast collections
of stars like our sun,
but at a great distance.
In order for them
to appear so small
and faint,
the distances
had to be so great
that light from them
would have taken
millions or even
billions of years
to reach us.
This indicated
that the beginning
of the universe
couldn't have been
just a few thousand
years ago.
Chronology of discoveries
made by Slipher
and Hubble
between 1910
and 1930.
1912.
Slipher measured light
from four nebulae,
finding three of them
red-shifted,
but Andromeda
blue-shifted.
His interpretation
was that Andromeda
is moving toward us
while the other nebulae
move away from us.
1912 to 1914,
Slipher measured
twelve more nebulae.
All except one
were red-shifted.
1914.
Slipher presented
his findings
to the American
Astronomical Society.
Hubble heard
the presentation.
1918.
Hubble began
to investigate
the nebulae.
1923.
Hubble determined
that the spiral nebulae,
including Andromeda,
are other galaxies.
1914 to 1925.
Slipher and others
kept measuring
Doppler shifts.
The score in 1925
was 43 red-shifts
to two blue-shifts.
1929.
Hubble and Milton Humerson,
after continuing
to measure Doppler shifts
and finding
that on the large scale
every galaxy
appears to be receding
from every other,
announced their discovery
that the universe
is expanding.
But the second thing
Hubble discovered
was even more remarkable.
Astronomers had learned
that by analyzing
the light from other galaxies,
it was possible
to measure
whether they're moving
toward us
or away from us.
To their great surprise,
they found that
nearly all galaxies
are moving away.
Moreover,
the farther they are
from us,
the faster
they're moving away.
It was Hubble
who recognized
the dramatic implications
of this discovery.
On the large scale,
every galaxy
is moving away
from every other galaxy.
The universe
is expanding.
Hubble's Law
By analyzing
the light
from other galaxies,
Edwin Hubble
discovered in the 1920s
that nearly all galaxies
are moving away from us
at a velocity,
v,
that is proportional
to their distance r
from the Earth.
So,
v equals h times r.
This important observation,
known as Hubble's Law,
established that
the universe
is expanding,
with the Hubble constant h
setting the rate
of expansion.
The Doppler effect
The relationship
between speed
and wavelength,
which is called
the Doppler effect,
is an everyday experience.
Listen to a plane
that passes overhead.
As it approaches,
its engine sounds
at a higher pitch,
and when it passes
and disappears,
it sounds at a lower pitch.
The higher pitch
corresponds to sound waves
with a shorter wavelength,
the distance between
one wave crest
and the next,
and a higher frequency,
the number of waves
per second.
This is because
as the plane moves
toward you,
it will be nearer to you
when it emits
the next wave crest,
lessening the distance
between wave crests.
Similarly,
as the plane moves away,
the wavelengths increase
and the pitch
you perceive
is lower.
The Doppler effect
is also true
of light waves.
If a galaxy
were to remain
at a constant distance
from Earth,
characteristic lines
in the spectrum
would appear
in a normal
or standard position.
However,
if the galaxy
is moving away from us,
the waves will appear
elongated or stretched,
and if the galaxy
is moving towards us,
then the waves
will appear
to be compressed.
The discovery
of the expansion
of the universe
was one of the great
intellectual revolutions
of the 20th century.
It came as a total surprise
and it completely changed
the discussion
of the origin
of the universe.
If the galaxies
are moving apart,
they must have been
closer together
in the past.
From the present rate
of expansion,
we can estimate
that they must have been
very close together indeed,
10 to 15 billion years ago.
As described
in the last chapter,
Roger Penrose and I
were able to show
that Einstein's
general theory
of relativity
implied that the universe
and time itself
must have had a beginning
in a tremendous explosion.
Here was the explanation
of why the sky
at night is dark.
No star could have been
shining longer
than 10 to 15 billion years,
the time
since the Big Bang.
The Hot Big Bang
If general relativity
were correct,
the universe
started with
an infinite temperature
and density
at the Big Bang singularity.
As the universe
expanded,
the temperature
of the radiation
decreased.
At about a hundredth
of a second
after the Big Bang,
the temperature
would have been
100 billion degrees
and the universe
would have contained
mostly photons,
electrons and neutrinos,
extremely light particles,
and their antiparticles,
together with some protons
and neutrons.
For the next three minutes,
as the universe
cooled to about
one billion degrees,
protons and neutrons
would have begun
combining to form
the nuclei
of helium,
hydrogen,
and other light elements.
Hundreds of thousands
of years later,
when the temperature
had dropped
to a few thousand degrees,
the electrons
would have slowed down
to the point
where the light nuclei
could capture them
to form atoms.
However,
the heavier elements
of which we are made,
such as carbon
and oxygen,
would not form
until billions
of years later
from the burning
of helium
in the centre of stars.
This picture
of a dense,
hot,
early stage
of the universe
was first put forward
by the scientist
George Gamow
in 1948,
in a paper he wrote
with Ralph Alpha,
which made
the remarkable prediction
that radiation
from this very hot
early stage
should still be around today.
Their prediction
was confirmed
in 1965
when the physicists
Arno Pencius
and Robert Wilson
observed the cosmic
microwave background
radiation.
We're used to the idea
that events
are caused
by earlier events,
which in turn
are caused
by still earlier events.
There's a chain
of causality
stretching back
into the past.
But suppose
this chain
has a beginning.
Suppose there was
a first event.
What caused it?
This was not a question
that many scientists
wanted to address.
They tried to avoid it,
either by claiming,
like the Russians,
that the universe
didn't have a beginning,
or by maintaining
that the origin
of the universe
didn't lie within
the realm of science
but belonged to
metaphysics or religion.
In my opinion,
this is not a position
any true scientist
should take.
If the laws of science
are suspended
at the beginning
of the universe,
might not they fail
at other times also?
A law is not a law
if it only holds
sometimes.
We must try
to understand
the beginning
of the universe
on the basis
of science.
It may be a task
beyond our powers,
but we should at least
make the attempt.
While the theorems
that Penrose and I
proved showed
that the universe
must have had a beginning,
they didn't give
much information
about the nature
of that beginning.
They indicated
that the universe
began in a Big Bang,
a point where
the whole universe
and everything in it
was scrunched up
into a single point
of infinite density.
At this point,
Einstein's general theory
of relativity
would have broken down,
so it can't be used
to predict
in what manner
the universe began.
One is left
with the origin
of the universe
apparently being
beyond the scope
of science.
This was not a conclusion
that scientists
should be happy with.
As chapters 1
and 2 point out,
the reason
general relativity
broke down
near the Big Bang
is that it didn't
incorporate
the uncertainty principle,
the random element
of quantum theory
that Einstein
had objected to
on the grounds
that God
does not play dice.
However,
all the evidence is
that God
is quite a gambler.
One can think
of the universe
as being like
a giant casino,
with dice being rolled
or wheels being spun
on every occasion.
You might think
that operating a casino
is a very chancy business
because you risk
losing money
each time dice are thrown
or the wheel is spun.
But over a large number
of bets,
the gains and losses
average out
to a result
that can be predicted,
even though the result
of any particular bet
cannot be predicted.
The casino operators
make sure the odds
average out
in their favour.
That's why casino operators
are so rich.
The only chance
you have
of winning against them
is to stake
all your money
on a few rolls
of the dice
or spins of the wheel.
It's the same
with the universe.
When the universe
is big,
as it is today,
there are a very large
number of rolls
of the dice,
and the results
average out
to something
one can predict.
That's why
classical laws
work for large systems.
But when the universe
is very small,
as it was
near in time
to the Big Bang,
there are only
a small number
of rolls of the dice,
and the uncertainty
principle
is very important.
Because the universe
keeps on rolling
the dice
to see what happens
next,
it doesn't have
just a single history
as one might have thought.
Instead,
the universe
must have
every possible history,
each with its own
probability.
There must be
a history of the universe
in which Belize
won every gold medal
at the Olympic Games,
though maybe
the probability
is low.
This idea
that the universe
has multiple histories
may sound like
science fiction,
but it is now
accepted
as science fact.
It was formulated
by Richard Feynman,
who was both
a great physicist
and quite a character.
Feynman's Stories
Born in Brooklyn,
New York,
in 1918,
Richard Feynman
completed his PhD
under John Wheeler
at Princeton University
in 1942.
Shortly afterward,
he was drawn
into the Manhattan Project.
He was known
for both his
exuberant personality
and practical jokes.
At the Los Alamos labs,
he enjoyed cracking
the top-secret safes,
and for being
an exceptional physicist.
He became a key contributor
to atomic bomb theory.
Feynman's perpetual curiosity
about the world
was the very root
of his being.
It was not only the engine
for his scientific success,
it led him to numerous
astonishing exploits,
such as deciphering
Mayan hieroglyphics.
In the years
following World War II,
Feynman found
a powerful new way
of thinking
about quantum mechanics,
for which he was awarded
the Nobel Prize
in 1965.
He challenged
the basic classical assumption
that each particle
has one particular history.
Instead,
he suggested
that particles travel
from one location
to another
along every possible path
through space-time.
With each trajectory,
Feynman associated
two numbers,
one for the size,
the amplitude,
of a wave,
and one for its phase,
whether it's at a crest
or a trough.
The probability
of a particle
going from A to B
is found
by adding up
the waves
associated
with every possible path
that passes
through A and B.
Nevertheless,
in the everyday world,
it seems to us
that objects
follow a single path
between their origin
and their final destination.
This agrees
with Feynman's
multiple history idea,
because,
for large objects,
his rule
for assigning numbers
to each path
ensures that all paths
but one
cancel out
when their contributions
are combined.
Only one of the infinity
of paths matters
as far as the motion
of macroscopic objects
is concerned,
and this trajectory
is precisely the one
emerging from Newton's
classical laws of motion.
We're now working
to combine
Einstein's
general theory
of relativity
and Feynman's idea
of multiple histories
into a complete
unified theory
that would describe
everything that happens
in the universe.
This unified theory
will enable us
to calculate
how the universe
will develop
if we know
how the histories started.
But the unified theory
will not in itself
tell us how the universe
began
or what its initial state was.
For that,
we need what are called
boundary conditions,
rules that tell us
what happens
on the frontiers
of the universe,
the edges of space
and time.
If the frontier
of the universe
was just at a normal
point of space and time,
we could go past it
and claim the territory
beyond as part
of the universe.
On the other hand,
if the boundary
of the universe
was at a jagged edge
where space and time
were scrunched up
and the density
was infinite,
it would be very difficult
to define meaningful
boundary conditions.
However,
a colleague named
Jim Hartle and I
realised there was
a third possibility.
Maybe the universe
has no boundary
in space and time.
At first sight,
this seems to be
in direct contradiction
with the theorems
that Penrose and I proved,
which showed that
the universe
must have a beginning,
a boundary in time.
However,
as explained in Chapter 2,
there is another kind
of time called
imaginary time
that is at right angles
to the ordinary real time
that we feel going by.
The history of the universe
in real time
determines its history
in imaginary time
and vice versa,
but the two kinds
of history
can be very different.
In particular,
the universe need
have no beginning
or end
in imaginary time.
Imaginary time
behaves just like
another direction
in space.
Thus,
the histories of the universe
in imaginary time
can be thought of
as curved surfaces,
like a ball,
a plane,
or a saddle shape,
but with four dimensions
instead of two.
If the histories
of the universe
went off to infinity,
like a saddle or a plane,
one would have the problem
of specifying
what the boundary conditions
were at infinity.
But one can avoid
having to specify
boundary conditions at all
if the histories
of the universe
in imaginary time
are closed surfaces,
like the surface
of the earth.
The surface of the earth
doesn't have
any boundaries or edges.
There are no reliable reports
of people falling off.
If the histories
of the universe
in imaginary time
are indeed closed surfaces,
as Hartle and I proposed,
it would have
fundamental implications
for philosophy
and our picture
of where we came from.
The universe
would be entirely
self-contained.
It wouldn't need
anything outside
to wind up the clockwork
and set it going.
Instead,
everything in the universe
would be determined
by the laws of science
and by rolls of the dice
within the universe.
This may sound presumptuous,
but it is what I
and many other scientists
believe.
Even if the boundary condition
of the universe
is that it has no boundary,
it won't have
just a single history.
It will have
multiple histories,
as suggested by Feynman.
There will be a history
in imaginary time
corresponding to
every possible
closed surface,
and each history
in imaginary time
will determine
a history in real time.
Thus,
we have a superabundance
of possibilities
for the universe.
What picks out
the particular universe
that we live in
from the set
of all possible universes?
One point we can notice
is that many
of the possible histories
of the universe
won't go through
the sequence
of forming galaxies
and stars
that was essential
to our own development.
While it may be
that intelligent beings
can evolve
without galaxies
and stars,
this seems unlikely.
Thus,
the very fact
that we exist
as beings
who can ask
the question
why is the universe
the way it is
is a restriction
on the history
we live in.
It implies
it is one of the
minority of histories
that have galaxies
and stars.
This is an example
of what is called
the Anthropic Principle.
The Anthropic Principle
Roughly speaking,
the Anthropic Principle
says that we see
the universe
the way it is,
at least in part,
because we exist.
It is a perspective
that is diametrically
opposed to the dream
of a fully predictive
unified theory
in which the laws
of nature are complete
and the world
is the way it is
because it could not
be otherwise.
There are a number
of different versions
of the Anthropic Principle,
ranging from those
that are so weak
as to be trivial
to those that are
so strong
as to be absurd.
Although most scientists
are reluctant
to adopt the strong version
of the Anthropic Principle,
few people would quarrel
with the utility
of some weak
Anthropic Arguments.
The weak Anthropic Principle
amounts to an explanation
of which of the various
possible eras
or parts of the universe
we could inhabit.
For instance,
the reason why
the Big Bang occurred
about 10,000 million years ago
is that the universe
must be old enough
so that some stars
will have completed
their evolution
to produce elements
like oxygen and carbon
out of which we are made,
and young enough
so that some stars
would still be providing
energy to sustain life.
Within the framework
of the No Boundary Proposal,
one can use Feynman's rule
for assigning numbers
to each history
of the universe
to find which properties
of the universe
are likely to occur.
In this context,
the Anthropic Principle
is implemented
by requiring
that the histories
contain intelligent life.
One would feel happier
about the Anthropic Principle,
of course,
if one could show
that a number
of different initial configurations
for the universe
are likely to have evolved
to produce a universe
like the one we observe.
This would imply
that the initial state
of the part of the universe
that we inhabit
did not have to be chosen
with great care.
The Anthropic Principle says
that the universe
has to be more or less
as we see it,
because if it were different,
there wouldn't be anyone
here to observe it.
Many scientists
dislike the Anthropic Principle
because it seems rather vague
and doesn't appear
to have much predictive power.
But the Anthropic Principle
can be given
a precise formulation,
and it seems to be essential
when dealing
with the origin
of the universe.
M-Theory,
described in Chapter 2,
allows a very large number
of possible histories
for the universe.
Most of these histories
are not suitable
for the development
of intelligent life.
Either they are empty,
last for too short a time,
are too highly curved,
or wrong in some other way.
Yet according to
Richard Feynman's idea
of multiple histories,
these uninhabited histories
can have quite a high probability.
In fact,
it doesn't really matter
how many histories
there may be
that don't contain
intelligent beings.
We're interested only
in the subset of histories
in which intelligent life develops.
This intelligent life
needn't be anything like humans.
Little green aliens
would do as well.
In fact,
they might do rather better.
The human race
doesn't have a very good record
of intelligent behavior.
As an example
of the power
of the anthropic principle,
consider the number
of directions in space.
It's a matter of common experience
that we live
in three-dimensional space.
That is to say,
we can represent
the position
of a point in space
by three numbers.
For example,
latitude,
longitude,
and height above sea level.
But why is space
three-dimensional?
Why isn't it two,
or four,
or some other number
of dimensions,
as in science fiction?
In M theory,
space has nine
or ten dimensions,
but it is thought
that six or seven
of the directions
are curled up very small,
leaving three directions
that are large
and nearly flat.
Why don't we live
in a history
in which eight
of the dimensions
are curled up small,
leaving only two dimensions
that we notice?
A two-dimensional animal
would have a hard job
digesting food.
If it had a gut
that went right through it,
it would divide
the animal in two,
and the poor creature
would fall apart.
So two flat directions
are not enough
for anything as complicated
as intelligent life.
On the other hand,
if there were four
or more nearly flat directions,
the gravitational force
between two bodies
would increase more rapidly
as they approached each other.
This would mean
that planets
would not have stable orbits
about their suns.
They would either
fall into the sun,
or escape
to the outer darkness
and cold.
Similarly,
the orbits of electrons
in atoms
would not be stable,
so matter as we know it
wouldn't exist.
Thus,
although the idea
of multiple histories
would allow any number
of nearly flat directions,
only histories
with three flat directions
will contain
intelligent beings.
Only in such histories
will the question
be asked,
why does space
have three dimensions?
The simplest history
of the universe
in imaginary time
is a round sphere
like the surface
of the Earth,
but with two more dimensions.
It determines
a history of the universe
in the real time
that we experience,
in which the universe
is the same
at every point of space
and is expanding
in time.
In these respects,
it is like the universe
we live in,
but the rate of expansion
is very rapid
and it keeps on
getting faster.
Such accelerating expansion
is called inflation
because it's like
the way prices
go up and up
at an ever-increasing rate.
Inflation
may be a law
of nature.
Inflation in Germany
rose after the peace
until by February 1920
the price level
was five times as high
as it had been
in 1918.
After July 1922,
the phase of
hyperinflation began.
All confidence
in money vanished
and the price index
rose faster and faster
for 15 months
outpacing the printing presses
which couldn't produce money
as fast as it was depreciating.
By late 1923,
300 paper mills
were working at top speed
and 150 printing companies
had 2,000 presses
running day and night
turning out currency.
Inflation in prices
is generally held
to be a bad thing,
but in the case of the universe,
inflation is very beneficial.
The large amount
of expansion
smooths out
any lumps and bumps
that there may have been
in the early universe.
As the universe expands,
it borrows energy
from the gravitational field
to create more matter.
The positive matter energy
is exactly balanced
by the negative
gravitational energy,
so the total energy
is zero.
When the universe
doubles in size,
the matter
and gravitational energies
both double,
so twice zero
is still zero.
If only the banking world
were so simple.
If the history of the universe
in imaginary time
were a perfectly round sphere,
the corresponding history
in real time
would be a universe
that continued to expand
in an inflationary manner
forever.
While the universe
is inflating,
matter could not fall together
to form galaxies and stars,
and life,
let alone intelligent life,
like us,
couldn't develop.
Thus,
although histories
of the universe
in imaginary time
that are perfectly round spheres
are allowed
by the notion
of multiple histories,
they're not of much interest.
However,
histories in imaginary time
that are slightly flattened
at the south pole
of the spheres
are much more relevant.
In this case,
the corresponding history
in real time
will expand
in an accelerated
inflationary manner
at first,
but then
the expansion
will begin to slow down
and galaxies can form.
In order for intelligent life
to be able to develop,
the flattening
at the south pole
must be very slight.
This will mean
that the universe
will expand initially
by an enormous amount.
The record level
of monetary inflation
occurred in Germany
between the world wars,
and prices rose
billions of times.
But the amount
of inflation
that must have occurred
in the universe
is at least
a billion,
billion,
billion times that.
Because of the
uncertainty principle,
there won't be
just one history
of the universe
that contains
intelligent life.
Instead,
the histories
in imaginary time
will be a whole family
of slightly
deformed spheres,
each of which
corresponds to a history
in real time
in which the universe
inflates for a long time
but not indefinitely.
We could then ask
which of these
allowable histories
is the most probable.
It turns out
that the most probable histories
are not completely smooth
but have tiny
ups and downs.
The ripples
on the most probable histories
really are minuscule.
The departures
from smoothness
are of the order
of one part
in a hundred thousand.
Nevertheless,
although they're
extremely small,
we've managed
to observe them
as small variations
in the microwaves
that come to us
from different directions
in space.
The Cosmic Background
Explorer satellite
was launched
in 1989
and made a map
of the sky
in microwaves.
Different colours
indicate different temperatures
but the whole range,
from red to blue,
is only about
a ten-thousandth
of a degree.
Yet this is enough
variation between
different regions
of the early universe
for the extra-gravitational
attraction
in the denser regions
to stop them
expanding eventually
and to cause them
to collapse again
under their own gravity
to form galaxies
and stars.
So in principle,
at least,
the COBE map
is the blueprint
for all the structures
in the universe.
What will be
the future behaviour
of the most probable
histories of the universe
that are compatible
with the appearance
of intelligent beings?
There seem to be
various possibilities,
depending on the amount
of matter in the universe.
If there's more
than a certain
critical amount,
the gravitational attraction
between the galaxies
will slow them down
and will eventually
stop them
from flying apart.
They will then start
falling towards each other
and will all come together
in a big crunch
that will be the end
of the history
of the universe
in real time.
If the density
of the universe
is below the critical value,
gravity is too weak
to stop the galaxies
from flying apart forever.
All the stars
will burn out
and the universe
will get increasingly
emptier and colder.
So again,
things will come to an end,
but in a less dramatic way.
Either way,
the universe will last
a good few billion years more.
As well as matter,
the universe may contain
what is called
vacuum energy,
energy that's present
even in apparently
empty space.
By Einstein's famous equation,
E equals mc squared,
this vacuum energy
has mass.
This means that it has
a gravitational effect
on the expansion
of the universe.
But remarkably enough,
the effect of vacuum energy
is the opposite
of that of matter.
Matter causes the expansion
to slow down
and can eventually
stop and reverse it.
On the other hand,
vacuum energy
causes the expansion
to accelerate
as an inflation.
In fact,
vacuum energy
acts just like
the cosmological constant
mentioned in chapter one
that Einstein added
to his original equations
in 1917,
when he realized
that they didn't admit
a solution
representing a static universe.
After Hubble's discovery
of the expansion
of the universe,
this motivation
for adding a term
to the equations
disappeared,
and Einstein rejected
the cosmological constant
as a mistake.
However,
it may not have been
a mistake at all.
As described in chapter two,
we now realize
that quantum theory
implies that space-time
is filled with
quantum fluctuations.
In a supersymmetric theory,
the infinite positive
and negative energies
of these ground state
fluctuations
cancel out between
particles of different spin.
But we wouldn't expect
the positive
and negative energies
to cancel so completely
that there wasn't
a small,
finite amount
of vacuum energy
left over,
because the universe
is not in a
supersymmetric state.
The only surprise is
that the vacuum energy
is so nearly zero
that it was not obvious
some time ago.
Maybe this is another example
of the anthropic principle.
A history with a larger
vacuum energy
would not have formed galaxies,
so would not contain beings
who could ask the question,
why is the vacuum energy
so low?
We can try to determine
the amounts of matter
and vacuum energy
in the universe
from various observations.
We can show the results
in a diagram
in which the matter density
is a horizontal direction
and vacuum energy
is a vertical direction.
A dotted line
shows the boundary
of the region
in which intelligent life
could develop.
Observations of supernovas
clustering
and the microwave background
each mark out regions
in this diagram.
Fortunately,
all three regions
have a common intersection.
If the matter density
and vacuum energy
lie in this intersection,
it means that
the expansion of the universe
has begun to speed up again
after a long period
of slowing down.
It seems that inflation
may be a law of nature.
In this chapter,
we've seen how the behavior
of the vast universe
can be understood
in terms of its history
in imaginary time,
which is a tiny,
slightly flattened sphere.
It is like
Hamlet's nutshell.
Yet this nut
encodes everything
that happens in real time.
So Hamlet
was quite right.
We could be bounded
in a nutshell
and still count ourselves
kings
of infinite space.
Chapter 4
Predicting the Future
How the Loss of Information
How the Loss of Information
in Black Holes
May Reduce Our Ability
to Predict the Future
The human race
has always wanted
to control the future,
or at least
to predict
what will happen.
That's why astrology
is so popular.
Astrology claims
that events on Earth
are related
to the motions
of the planets
across the sky.
This is a scientifically
testable hypothesis,
or would be
if astrologers
stuck their necks out
and made definite
predictions
that could be tested.
However,
wisely enough,
they make their forecasts
so vague
that they can apply
to any outcome.
Statements such as
personal relations
may become intense,
or
you will have
a financially rewarding
opportunity
can never be proved wrong.
But the real reason
most scientists
don't believe in astrology
is not scientific evidence
or the lack of it,
but because
it's not consistent
with other theories
that have been tested
by experiment.
When Copernicus
and Galileo
discovered that the planets
orbit the sun
rather than the Earth,
and Newton discovered
the laws that govern
their motion,
astrology became
extremely implausible.
Why should the positions
of other planets
against the background sky
as seen from Earth
have any correlations
with the macromolecules
on a minor planet
that call themselves
intelligent life?
Yet this is what
astrology would have us believe.
There is no more
experimental evidence
for some of the theories
described in this book
than there is for astrology,
but we believe them
because they are consistent
with theories
that have survived testing.
The success of Newton's laws
and other physical theories
led to the idea
of scientific determinism,
which was first expressed
at the beginning
of the 19th century
by the French scientist
the Marquis de Laplace.
Laplace suggested
that if we knew
the positions and velocities
of all the particles
in the universe
at one time,
the laws of physics
should allow us
to predict
what the state
of the universe
would be at any other time
in the past
or in the future.
In other words,
if scientific determinism holds,
we should in principle
be able to predict
the future
and wouldn't need astrology.
Of course, in practice,
even something as simple
as Newton's theory of gravity
produces equations
that we can't solve exactly
for more than two particles.
Furthermore,
the equations often
have a property
known as chaos,
so that a small change
in position or velocity
at one time
can lead to completely
different behaviour
at later times.
As those who've seen
Jurassic Park know,
a tiny disturbance
in one place
can cause a major change
in another.
A butterfly
flapping its wings
in Tokyo
can cause rain
in New York's Central Park.
And the trouble is,
the sequence of events
is not repeatable.
The next time
the butterfly flaps
its wings,
a host of other factors
will be different
and will also influence
the weather.
That's why weather forecasts
are so unreliable.
Thus,
although in principle
the laws of quantum
electrodynamics
should allow us
to calculate everything
in chemistry
and biology,
we've not had much success
in predicting
human behaviour
from mathematical equations.
Nevertheless,
despite these
practical difficulties,
most scientists
have comforted themselves
with the idea
that, again in principle,
the future is predictable.
At first sight,
determinism would also
seem to be threatened
by the uncertainty principle,
which says that
we can't measure accurately
both the position
and the velocity
of a particle
at the same time.
The more accurately
we measure the position,
the less accurately
we can determine
the velocity
and vice versa.
The Laplace version
of scientific determinism
held that if we knew
the positions
and velocities
of particles
at one time,
we could determine
their positions
and velocities
at any time
in the past or future.
But how could we
even get started
if the uncertainty principle
prevented us
from knowing accurately
both the positions
and the velocities
at one time?
However good
our computer is,
if we put lousy data in,
we get lousy predictions out.
However,
determinism was restored
in a modified form
in a new theory
called quantum mechanics
which incorporated
the uncertainty principle.
In quantum mechanics
one can,
roughly speaking,
accurately predict
half of what
one would expect
to predict
in the classical
Laplace point of view.
In quantum mechanics
a particle doesn't have
a well-defined position
or velocity
but its state
can be represented
by what is called
a wave function.
A wave function
is a number
at each point of space
that gives the probability
that the particle
is to be found
at that position.
The rate at which
the wave function
changes from point to point
tells how probable
different particle
velocities are.
Some wave functions
are sharply peaked
at a particular point
in space.
In these cases
there is only
a small amount
of uncertainty
in the position
of the particle.
But we can also see
in the diagram
that in such cases
the wave function
changes rapidly
near the point
up on one side
and down on the other.
That means
the probability distribution
for the velocity
is spread over
a wide range.
In other words
the uncertainty
in the velocity
is large.
Consider on the other hand
a continuous train
of waves.
Now there is
a large uncertainty
in position
but a small uncertainty
in velocity.
So the description
of a particle
by a wave function
does not have
a well-defined position
or velocity.
It satisfies
the uncertainty principle.
We now realize
that the wave function
is all that can be
well-defined.
We can't even suppose
that the particle
has a position
and velocity
that are known to God
but are hidden from us.
Such hidden variable theories
predict results
that are not in agreement
with observation.
Even God
is bound by
the uncertainty principle
and can't know
the position
and velocity.
He can only know
the wave function.
The rate at which
the wave function
changes with time
is given by what is called
the Schrodinger equation.
If we know
the wave function
at one time
we can use
the Schrodinger equation
to calculate it
at any other time
past or future.
Therefore
there is still
determinism in quantum theory
but it's on a reduced scale.
Instead of being able
to predict
both the positions
and the velocities
we can predict
only the wave function.
This can allow us
to predict
either the positions
or the velocities
but not both accurately.
Thus in quantum theory
the ability
to make exact predictions
is just half
what it was
in the classical
Laplace world view.
Nevertheless
within this restricted sense
it is still possible
to claim
that there is determinism.
However
the use of the
Schrodinger equation
to evolve
the wave function
forward in time
that is
to predict
what it will be
at future times
implicitly assumes
that time
runs on smoothly
everywhere
forever.
This was certainly
true in Newtonian physics.
Time was assumed
to be absolute
meaning that
each event
in the history
of the universe
was labelled
by a number
called time
and that a series
of time labels
ran smoothly
from the infinite past
to the infinite future.
This is what might be called
the common sense view
of time
and it is the view
of time
that most people
and even most physicists
have at the back
of their minds.
However in 1905
as we've seen
the concept
of absolute time
was overthrown
by the special theory
of relativity
in which time
was no longer
an independent quantity
on its own
but was just
one direction
in a four-dimensional
continuum
called space-time.
In special relativity
different observers
travelling at different
velocities
move through space-time
on different paths.
Each observer
has his or her
own measure of time
along the path
he or she is following
and different observers
will measure
different intervals
of time
between events.
Thus in special relativity
there is no unique
absolute time
that we can use
to label events.
However
the space-time
of special relativity
is flat.
This means that
in special relativity
the time measured
by any freely moving observer
increases smoothly
in space-time
from minus infinity
in the infinite past
to plus infinity
in the infinite future.
We can use
any of these measures
of time
in the Schrodinger equation
to evolve
the wave function.
In special relativity
therefore
we still have
the quantum version
of determinism.
The situation
was different
in the general theory
of relativity
in which space-time
was not flat
but curved
and distorted
by the matter
and energy in it.
In our solar system
the curvature
of space-time
is so slight
at least
on a macroscopic scale
that it doesn't interfere
with our usual idea
of time.
In this situation
we could still use
this time
in the Schrodinger equation
to get a deterministic
evolution
of the wave function.
However
once we allow
space-time
to be curved
the door
is open
to the possibility
that it may
have a structure
that doesn't
admit a time
that increases
smoothly
for every observer
as we would expect
for a reasonable
measure of time.
For example
suppose that space-time
was like a vertical cylinder.
Height up the cylinder
would be a measure
of time
that increased
for every observer
and ran from
minus infinity
to plus infinity.
However
imagine instead
that space-time
was like a cylinder
with a handle
or wormhole
that branched off
and then joined back.
Then
any measure of time
would necessarily
have stagnation points
where the handle
joined the main cylinder
points
where time
stood still.
At these points
time would not
increase for any observer.
In such a space-time
we couldn't use
the Schrodinger equation
to get a deterministic
evolution
for the wave function.
Watch out for wormholes.
You never know
what may come out of them.
Black holes
are the reason
we think time
will not increase
for every observer.
The first discussion
of black holes
appeared in 1783.
A former Cambridge Don,
John Mitchell,
presented the following
argument.
If one fires a particle
such as a cannonball
vertically upward
its ascent
will be slowed
by gravity
and eventually
the particle
will stop moving upward
and will fall back.
However
if the initial
upward velocity
is greater
than a critical value
called the escape velocity
gravity will never
be strong enough
to stop the particle
and it will get away.
The escape velocity
is about 12 kilometers
per second
for the Earth
and about 100 kilometers
per second
for the Sun.
Both of these
escape velocities
are much higher
than the speed
of real cannonballs
but they're small
compared to the speed
of light
which is
300,000 kilometers
per second.
Thus
light can get away
from the Earth
or Sun
without much
difficulty.
However
Mitchell argued
that there could
be stars
that are much
more massive
than the Sun
and have escape
velocities
greater than
the speed
of light.
We would not
be able to
see these stars
because any
light they sent
out would be
dragged back
by the gravity
of the star.
Thus
they would be
what Mitchell
called
dark stars
and we now
call
black holes.
Mitchell's idea
of dark stars
was based
on Newtonian
physics
in which
time was
absolute
and went
on regardless
of what
happened.
Thus
they didn't
affect our
ability to
predict the
future
in the
classical
Newtonian
picture
but the
situation
was very
different
in the
general
theory
of
relativity
in which
massive
bodies
curve
space-time.
In 1916
shortly after
the theory
was first
formulated
Carl
Schwarzschild
who died
soon after
of an illness
contracted
on the Russian
front in the
First World War
found a solution
of the field
equations of
general relativity
that represented
a black hole.
The Schwarzschild
black hole
Schwarzschild's
work revealed
a stunning
implication
of general
relativity.
He showed
that if the
mass of a
star is
concentrated
in a
small enough
region
the gravitational
field at
the surface
of the star
becomes so
strong that
even light
can no
longer escape.
This is
what we now
call a
black hole.
A region
of space-time
bounded by
a so-called
event horizon
from which
it is
impossible
for anything
including
light to
reach a
distant
observer.
For a
long time
most
physicists
including
Einstein
were
sceptical
whether
such
extreme
configurations
of
matter
could
actually
ever
occur
in the
real
universe.
However,
we now
understand
that when
any sufficiently
heavy
non-rotating
star,
however
complicated
its shape
and internal
structure,
runs out
of nuclear
fuel,
it will
necessarily
collapse to
a perfectly
spherical
Schatzfield
black hole.
What Schwarzschild
had found
wasn't
understood or
its importance
recognized for
many years.
Einstein himself
never believed
in black holes
and his attitude
was shared by
most of the
old guard
in general
relativity.
I remember
going to
Paris to
give a
seminar on
my discovery
that quantum
theory means
that black
holes aren't
completely
black.
My seminar
fell rather
flat because
at that time
almost no one
in Paris
believed in
black holes.
The French
also felt
that the name
as they
translated it
True Noir
had dubious
sexual connotations
and should be
replaced by
Astre Oclu
or Hidden
Star.
However,
neither this
nor other
suggested names
caught the
public
imagination
like the
term
black hole
which was
first introduced
by John
Archibald
Wheeler
the American
physicist
who inspired
much of the
modern work
in this field.
John
Wheeler
John
Archibald
Wheeler
was born
in 1911
in Jacksonville,
Florida.
He earned
his PhD
from Johns
Hopkins University
in 1933
for his work
on the scattering
of light
by the helium
atom.
In 1938
he worked
with the
Danish
physicist
Niels Bohr
to develop
the theory
of nuclear
fission.
For a while
thereafter
Wheeler
together with
his graduate
student
Richard Feynman
concentrated
on the study
of electrodynamics
but shortly
after America
entered World
War II
both went on
to contribute
to the
Manhattan
Project.
In the early
1950s
inspired by
Robert Oppenheimer's
work in 1939
on the gravitational
collapse of a
massive star
Wheeler turned
his attention
to Einstein's
theory of
general relativity.
At that time
most physicists
were caught up
in the study
of nuclear
physics
and general
relativity
was not really
regarded as
relevant to the
physical world
but almost
single-handedly
Wheeler
transformed the
field
both through
his research
and through
his teaching
of Princeton's
first course
on relativity.
Much later
in 1969
he coined
the term
black hole
for the
collapsed
state of
matter
which few
yet believed
was real.
Inspired by
the work
of Werner
Israel
he conjectured
that black
holes have
no hair
which meant
that the
collapsed state
of any
non-rotating
massive star
could in fact
be described
by Schwarzschild's
solution.
The discovery
of quasars
in 1963
brought forth
an outburst
of theoretical
work on
black holes
and observational
attempts to
detect them.
Here's the picture
that has emerged.
Consider what
we believe
would be
the history
of a star
with a mass
twenty times
that of the
Sun.
Such stars
form from
clouds of gas
like those
in the Orion
nebula.
As clouds
of gas
contract
under their
own gravity
the gas
heats up
and eventually
becomes hot
enough to
start the
nuclear fusion
reaction
that converts
hydrogen
into helium.
The heat
generated
by this
process
creates a
pressure
that supports
the star
against its
own gravity
and stops
it from
contracting
further.
A star
will stay
in this
state for
a long
time
burning
hydrogen
and radiating
light into
space.
The gravitational
field of the
star will
affect the
paths of
light rays
coming from
it.
One can
draw a
diagram
with time
plotted upward
and distance
from the
centre of
the star
plotted
horizontally.
In this
diagram
the surface
of the star
is represented
by two
vertical lines
one on
either side
of the
centre.
One can
choose that
time be
measured in
seconds
and distance
in light
seconds.
The distance
light travels
in a
second.
When we
use these
units
the speed
of light
is one
that is
the speed
of light
is one
light
second
per second.
This means
that far
from the
star
and its
gravitational
field
the path
of a
light ray
on the
diagram
is a
line
at a
45 degree
angle
to the
vertical.
However
nearer
the star
the curvature
of space
time
produced
by the
mass
of the
star
will
change
the
paths
of the
light
rays
and
cause
them
to be
at a
smaller
angle
to the
vertical.
Massive
stars
will burn
their
hydrogen
into
helium
much
faster
than
the
sun
does.
This
means
they
can
run
out
of
hydrogen
in
as
little
as
a
few
hundred
million
years.
After
that
such
stars
face
a
crisis.
They
can
burn
their
helium
into
heavier
elements
such
as
carbon
and
oxygen
but
these
nuclear
reactions
don't
release
much
energy
so
the
stars
lose
heat
and
the
thermal
pressure
that
supports
them
against
gravity.
Therefore
they
begin
to
get
smaller.
If
they
are
more
than
about
twice
the
mass
of
the
sun
the
pressure
will
never
be
sufficient
to
stop
the
contraction.
They'll
collapse
to
zero
size
and
infinite
density
to
form
what
is
called
a
singularity.
In
the
diagram
of
time
against
distance
from
the
center
as
a
star
shrinks
the
paths
of
light
rays
from
its
surface
will
start
out
at
smaller
and
smaller
angles
to
the
vertical.
When
the
star
reaches
a
certain
critical
radius
the
path
will
be
vertical
on
the
diagram
which
means
that
the
light
will
hover
at
a
constant
distance
from
the
center
of
the
star
never
getting
away.
This
critical
path
of
light
will
sweep
out
a
surface
called
the
event
horizon
which
separates
the
region
of
space
time
from
which
light
can
escape
from
the
region
from
which
it
can't.
Any
light
emitted
by
the
star
after
it
passes
the
event
horizon
will
be
bent
back
inward
by
the
curvature
of
space
time.
The
star
will
have
become
one
of
Mitchell's
dark
stars
or
as we
say
now
a
black
hole.
The
answer
is
that
a
black
hole
still
exerts
the
same
gravitational
pull
on
neighbouring
objects
as
did
the
body
that
collapsed.
If
the
sun
were
a
black
hole
and
had
managed
to
become
one
without
losing
any
of
its
mass
the
planets
would
still
orbit
as
they
do
now.
One
way
of
searching
for
a
black
hole
is
therefore
to
look
for
matter
that
is
orbiting
what
seems
to
be
an
unseen
compact
massive
object.
A
number
of
such
systems
have
been
observed.
Perhaps
the
most
impressive
are
the
giant
black
holes
that
occur
in
the
centres
of
galaxies
and
quasars.
The
properties
of
black
holes
that
have
been
discussed
thus
far
don't
raise
any
great
problems
with
determinism.
Time
will
come
to
an
end
for
an
astronaut
who
falls
into
a
black
hole
and
hits
the
singularity.
However,
in
general
relativity,
one
is
free
to
measure
time
at
different
rates
in
different
places.
One
could,
therefore,
speed
up the
astronaut's
watch
as he
or she
approached
the
singularity
so that
it still
registered
an
infinite
interval
of
time.
On
the
time
and
distance
diagram,
the
surfaces
of
constant
values
of
this
new
time
would
be
all
crowded
together
at
the
centre,
below
the
point
where
the
singularity
appeared.
But
they
would
agree
with
the
usual
measure
of
time
in
the
nearly
flat
space
time
far
away
from
the
black
hole.
One
could
use
this
time
in
the
Schrodinger
equation
and
calculate
the
wave
function
at
later
times
if
one
knew
it
initially.
Thus,
one
still
has
determinism.
It's
worth
noting,
however,
that at
late
times,
part
of the
wave
function
is
inside
the
black
hole,
where
it
can't
be
observed
by
someone
outside.
Thus,
an
observer
who is
sensible
enough
not
to
fall
into
a
black
hole
can't
run
the
Schrodinger
equation
backward
and
calculate
the
wave
function
at
early
times.
To
do
that,
he
or
she
would
need
to
know
the
part
of
the
wave
function
that's
inside
the
black
hole.
This
contains
the
information
about
what
fell
into
the
hole.
This
is
potentially
a
very
large
amount
of
information
because
a
black
hole
of
a
given
mass
and
rate
of
rotation
can
be
formed
from
a
very
large
number
of
different
collections
of
particles.
A
black
hole
does
not
depend
on
the
nature
of
the
body
that
had
collapsed
to
form
it.
John
Wheeler
called
this
result
a
black
hole
has
no
hair.
For
the
French,
this
just
confirmed
their
suspicions.
The
difficulty
with
determinism
arose
when I
discovered
that
black
holes
aren't
completely
black.
As we
saw in
Chapter
2,
quantum
theory
means that
fields
can't
be
exactly
zero
even
in
what
is
called
the
vacuum.
If
they
were
zero,
they
would
have
both
an
exact
value
or
position
at
zero
and
an
exact
rate
of
change
or
velocity
that
was
also
zero.
This
would
be
a
violation
of
the
uncertainty
principle,
which
says
that
the
position
and
velocity
can't
both
be
well
defined.
All
vacuum
fluctuations
in
the
same
way
that
the
pendulum
in
Chapter
2
had
to
have
zero
point
fluctuations.
Vacuum
fluctuations
can be
interpreted
in
several
ways
that
seem
different
but
are
in
fact
mathematically
equivalent.
From
a
positivist
viewpoint,
one
is
free
to
use
whatever
picture
is
most
useful
for
the
problem
in
question.
In
this
case,
it's
helpful
to
think
of
vacuum
fluctuations
as
pairs
of
virtual
particles
that
appear
together
point
of
space
time,
move
apart
and
come
back
together
and
annihilate
each
other.
Virtual
means
that
these
particles
can't
be
observed
directly
but
their
indirect
effects
can
be
measured
and
they
agree
with
theoretical
predictions
to a
remarkable
degree
of
accuracy.
If a
black
hole
is
present,
one
member
of
a
pair
of
particles
may
fall
into
the
black
hole
leaving
the
other
member
free
to
escape
to
infinity.
To
someone
far
appear
to
have
been
radiated
by
the
black
hole.
The
spectrum
of
a
black
hole
is
exactly
what
we
would
expect
from
a
hot
body
with
a
temperature
proportional
to
the
gravitational
field
on
the
horizon,
the
boundary
of
the
black
hole.
In
other
words,
the
temperature
of
a
black
hole
depends
on
its
size.
A
black
hole
of a
few
solar
masses
would
have
a
temperature
of
about
a
millionth
of
degree
above
absolute
zero,
and a
larger
black
hole
would
have
an
even
lower
temperature.
Thus,
any
quantum
radiation
from
such
black
holes
would
be
utterly
swamped
by
the
2.7
minus
degree
radiation
left
over
from
the
hot
Big
Bang,
the
cosmic
background
radiation
that we
discussed
in
Chapter
Two.
It
would
be
possible
to
detect
the
radiation
from
much
smaller
and
hotter
black
holes,
but
there
don't
seem
to
be
many
were
discovered
I
would
get
a
Nobel
Prize.
However,
we have
indirect
observational
evidence
for this
radiation,
and that
evidence
comes
from
the
early
universe.
As
described
in
Chapter
Three,
it's
thought
that
very
early
in
its
history
the
universe
went
through
an
inflationary
period
during
which
it
expanded
at
an
ever
increasing
rate.
The
expansion
during
this
period
would
have
been
so
rapid
that
some
objects
would
be
too
distant
from
us
universe
would
have
expanded
too
much
and
too
rapidly
while
that
light
was
traveling
toward
us.
Thus,
there
would
be
an
horizon
in
the
universe
like
the
horizon
of
a
black
hole,
separating
the
region
from
which
light
can
reach
us
and
the
region
from
which
it
can't.
Very
similar
arguments
show
that
there
should
be
thermal
radiation
from
this
horizon
as
there
is
from
a
black
hole
horizon.
In
thermal
radiation
in
this
case
these
density
fluctuations
would
have
expanded
with
the
universe.
When
their
length
scale
became
longer
than
the
size
of
the
event
horizon
they
would
have
become
frozen
in
so
that
we
can
observe
them
today
as
small
variations
in
the
temperature
of
the
cosmic
background
radiation
left
over
from
the
early
universe.
The
observations
of
those
variations
agree
with
the
predictions
of
thermal
fluctuations
with
remarkable
accuracy.
Even
if the
observational
evidence
for
black
hole
radiation
is a
bit
indirect
everyone
who has
studied
the
problem
agrees
it
must
occur
in
order
to
be
consistent
with
our
other
observationally
tested
theories.
This
has
important
implications
for
determinism.
The
radiation
from a
black
hole
will
carry
away
energy
which
must
mean
that
the
black
hole
will
lose
mass
and
get
smaller.
In
turn
this
will
mean
that
its
temperature
will
rise
and
the
rate
of
black
hole
will
get
down
to
zero
mass.
We
don't
know
how
to
calculate
what
happens
at
this
point
but
the
only
natural
reasonable
outcome
would
seem
to
be
that
the
black
hole
disappears
completely.
So
what
happens
then
to
the
part
of
the
wave
function
inside
the
black
hole
and
the
information
it
contains
about
what
had
fallen
into
the
black
hole?
The
first
guess
might
be
that
this
part
of
wave
function
and
the
information
it
carries
would
emerge
when
the
black
hole
finally
disappears.
However,
information
can't be
carried
for free,
as one
realises
when one
gets a
telephone
bill.
Information
requires
energy
to carry
it,
and there's
very little
energy
left in
the final
stages
of a
black
hole.
The
only
plausible
way
the
information
inside
could
get
out
would
be
if
it
emerged
continuously
with
the
radiation
rather
than waiting
for this
final
stage.
However,
according
to the
picture
of one
member
of a
virtual
particle
pair
falling
in
and
the
other
member
escaping,
one
wouldn't
expect
the
escaping
particle
to be
related
to what
fell in
or to
carry
away
information
about
it.
So the
only
answer
would
seem
to be
that
the
information
in
the
part
of
the
wave
function
inside
the
black
hole
gets
lost.
Such
loss
of
information
would
have
important
implications
for
determinism.
To
start
with,
we've
noted
that
even
if
you
knew
the
wave
function
after
the
black
hole
disappeared,
you
could
not
run
the
Schrodinger
equation
backward
and
calculate
what
the
wave
function
was
before
the
black
hole
formed.
What
that
was
would
depend
in
part
on
the
bit
of
the
wave
function
that
got
lost
in
the
black
hole.
We're
used
to
thinking
we
can
know
the
past
exactly.
However,
if
information
gets
lost
in
black
holes,
this
is
not
the
case.
Anything
could
have
happened.
In
general,
however,
people
such as
astrologers
and
those
who
consult
them
are
more
interested
in
predicting
the
future
than
in
retrodicting
the
past.
At
first
glance,
it
might
seem
that
the
loss
of
part
of
the
wave
function
down
the
black
hole
would
not
prevent
us
from
predicting
the
wave
function
outside
the
black
hole.
But
it
see
when
we
consider
a
thought
experiment
proposed
by
Einstein,
Boris
Podolsky
and
Nathan
Rosen
in
the
1930s.
Imagine
that
a
radioactive
atom
decays
and
sends
out
two
particles
in
opposite
directions
and
with
opposite
spins.
An
observer
who
looks
only
at
one
particle
can't
predict
whether
it
will
be
spinning
to
the
right
or
left.
But
if
the
observer
measures
it
to
be
spinning
to
the
right,
then
he or
she
can
predict
with
certainty
that
the
other
particle
will
be
spinning
to
the
left,
and
vice
versa.
Einstein
thought
that
this
proved
that
quantum
theory
was
ridiculous.
The
other
particle
might
be
at
the
other
side
of
the
galaxy
by
now,
yet
one
would
instantaneously
know
which
way
it
was
spinning.
However,
most
other
scientists
agreed
that it
was
Einstein
who
was
confused,
not
quantum
theory.
The
Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen
thought
experiment
doesn't
show that
one is
able to
send
information
faster
than
light.
That
would
be
the
ridiculous
part.
One
can't
choose
that
one's
own
particle
will
be
measured
to
be
spinning
to
the
right,
so
one
can't
prescribe
that
the
distant
observer's
particle
should
be
spinning
to
the
left.
In
fact,
this
thought
experiment
is
exactly
what
happens
with
black
hole
radiation.
The
virtual
particle
pair
will
have
a
wave
function
that
predicts
the
two
members
will
definitely
have
opposite
spins.
What
we
would
like
to
do
is
predict
the
spin
and
wave
function
of
the
outgoing
particle,
which
we
could
do
if
we
could
observe
the
particle
that's
fallen
in.
But
that
particle
is
now
inside
the
black
hole
where
its
spin
and
wave
function
can't
be
measured.
Because
of this,
it's
not
possible
to
predict
the
spin
or
the
wave
function
of
the
particle
that
escapes.
It
can
have
different
spins
and
different
wave
functions
with
various
probabilities,
but it
doesn't
have a
unique
spin
or
wave
function.
Thus
it would
seem
that our
power to
predict
the
future
would
be
further
reduced.
The
classical
idea of
Laplace,
that one
could
predict
both
the
positions
and
velocities
of
particles,
had
to be
modified
when the
uncertainty
principle
showed
that one
couldn't
accurately
measure both
positions
and
velocities.
However,
one could
still
measure
the
wave
function
and
use
the
Schrodinger
equation
to
predict
what
it
should
be
in
the
future.
This
would
allow
one
to
predict
with
certainty
one
combination
of
position
and
velocity,
which
is
half
of
what
one
could
predict
according
to
Laplace's
ideas.
We
can
predict
with
certainty
that
the
particles
have
opposite
spins,
but
if
one
particle
falls
into
the
black
hole,
there
is
no
prediction
we
can
make
with
certainty
about
the
remaining
particle.
This
means
that
there
isn't
any
measurement
outside
the
black
hole
that
can
be
predicted
with
certainty.
Our
ability
to
make
definite
predictions
would
be
reduced
to
zero.
So
maybe
astrology
is
no
worse
at
predicting
the
future
than
the
laws
of
science.
Many
physicists
didn't
like
this
reduction
in
determinism
and
therefore
suggested
that
information
about
what
is
inside
can
somehow
get
out
of
a
black
hole.
For
years
it
was
just
a
pious
hope
that
some
way
to
save
the
information
would
be
found.
But
in
1996
Andrew
Stomminger
and
Kumram
Waffer
made
an
important
advance.
They
chose
to
regard
a
black
hole
as
being
made
up
of
a
number
of
building
blocks
called
P-brains.
Recall
that
one way
of
thinking
about
P-brains
is
as
sheets
extra
dimensions
that
we
don't
notice.
In
certain
cases
one
can
show
that
the
number
of
waves
on
the
P-brains
is
the
same
as
the
amount
of
information
one
would
expect
the
black
hole
to
contain.
If
particles
hit
the
P-brains
they
excite
extra
waves
on
the
brains.
Similarly
if
waves
moving
in
different
directions
on
the
P-brains
come
together
at
some
point
they
can
create
a
peak
so
great
that
a
bit
of
the
P-brain
breaks
away
and
goes
off
as
a
particle.
Thus
the
P-brains
can
absorb
and
emit
particles
like
black
holes.
One
can
regard
the
P-brains
as
an
effective
theory.
That
is
while
we
don't
need
to
believe
that
there
are
actually
little
sheets
moving
through
a
flat
space
time
black
holes
can
behave
as
if
they
were
made
up
of
such
sheets.
It's
But
a
smooth
fluid
is
a
very
good
effective
model.
The
mathematical
model
of
black
holes
as
made
of
P-brains
gives
results
similar
to
the
virtual
particle
pair
picture
described
earlier.
Thus
from
a
positivist
viewpoint
it's
an
equally
good
model
at
least
for
certain
classes
of
black
hole.
For
these
classes
the
P-brain
model
predicts
exactly
the
same
rate
of
emission
that
the
virtual
particle
pair
model
predicts.
However
there is
one
important
difference.
In
the
P-brain
model
information
about
what
falls
into
the
black
hole
will
be
stored
in
the
wave
function
for
the
waves
on
the
P-brains.
The
P-brains
are
regarded
as
sheets
in
flat
space
time
and
for
that
reason
time
will
flow
forward
smoothly.
The
paths
of
light
rays
won't
be
bent
and
the
information
in
the
waves
won't
be
lost.
Instead
the
information
will
eventually
emerge
from
the
black
hole
in
the
radiation
from
the
P-brains.
Thus
according
to the
P-brain
model
we can
use
the
Schrodinger
equation
to
calculate
what
the
wave
function
will
be
at
later
times.
Nothing
will
get
lost
and
time
will
roll
smoothly
on.
We
will
have
complete
determinism
in
the
quantum
sense.
So
which
of these
pictures
is
correct?
Does
part
of
the
wave
function
get
lost
as
the
P-brain
model
suggests?
This
is one
of the
outstanding
questions
in
theoretical
physics
today.
Many
people
believe
that
recent
work
shows
that
information
is
not
lost.
The
world
is
safe
and
predictable
and
nothing
unexpected
will
happen.
But
it's
not
clear.
If
one
takes
Einstein's
general
theory
of
relativity
seriously,
one
must
allow
the
possibility
that
space-time
ties
itself
in a
knot
and
information
gets
lost
in the
folds.
Chapter
Five
Protecting
the
Past
Is
time
travel
possible?
Could
an
advanced
civilization
go
back
and
change
the
past?
My
friend
and
colleague
Kip
Thorne,
with
whom
I've
had
a
number
of
bets,
is
not
one
to
follow
the
accepted
line
in
physics
just
because
everyone
else
does.
This
has
led
him
to
have
the
courage
to
be
the
first
serious
scientist
to
discuss
time
travel
as a
practical
possibility.
It is
tricky to
speculate
openly about
time travel.
One risks
either an
outcry at
the waste
of public
money being
spent on
something so
ridiculous,
or a
demand that
the research
be classified
for military
purposes.
After all,
how could we
protect ourselves
against someone
with a time
machine?
They might
change history
and rule
the world.
There are only
a very few
of us foolhardy
enough to work
on a subject
that is so
politically
incorrect in
physics circles.
We disguise
the fact
by using
technical
terms
that are
code
for
time
travel.
The
basis
of all
modern
discussions
of
time
travel
is
Einstein's
general
theory
of
relativity.
As
we've
seen
in
earlier
chapters,
the
Einstein
equations
made
space
and
time
dynamic
by
describing
how
they
were
curved
and
distorted
by
the
matter
and
energy
in
the
universe.
In
general
relativity,
someone's
personal
time,
as measured
by their
wristwatch,
would always
increase,
just as it
did in
Newtonian
theory or
the flat
space-time
of special
relativity.
But there
was now
the possibility
that space-time
could be
warped so
much that
you could
go off
in a
spaceship
and come
back before
you set
out.
One way
this could
happen is
if there
were
wormholes,
tubes of
space-time
mentioned in
chapter 4
that connect
different regions
of space
and time.
The idea
is that
you steer
your
spaceship
into one
mouth of
the wormhole
and come
out of
the other
mouth in
a different
place and
at a
different
time.
Wormholes,
if they
exist,
would be
the solution
to the
speed limit
problem in
space.
It would
take tens
of thousands
of years
to cross
the galaxy
in a
spaceship that
travelled at
less than
the speed
of light,
as relativity
demands.
But you
might go
through a
wormhole to
the other
side of the
galaxy and
be back in
time for
dinner.
However,
one can
show that
if wormholes
exist,
you could
also use
them to
get back
before you
set out.
So you
might think
that you
could do
something like
blowing up
the rocket
on its
launch pad
to prevent
your setting
out in the
first place.
This is a
variation of
the grandfather
paradox.
What happens
if you go
back and
kill your
grandfather
before your
father was
conceived?
Of course,
this is a
paradox only
if you believe
you have
free will
to do
what you
like when
you go
back in
time.
This book
will not
go into
a philosophical
discussion
of free
will.
Instead,
it will
concentrate
on whether
the laws
of physics
allow
space-time
to be so
warped that
a macroscopic
body,
such as a
spaceship,
can return
to its
own
past.
According
to Einstein's
theory,
a spaceship
necessarily
travels at
less than
the local
speed of
light and
follows what's
called a
time-like
path through
space-time.
Thus,
one can
formulate the
question in
tentacle terms,
does space-time
admit time-like
curves that are
closed, that
is, that
return to
their starting
point again
and again?
I shall
refer to
such paths
as time
loops.
There are
three levels
on which we
can try to
answer this.
question.
The first is
Einstein's
general theory
of relativity,
which assumes
that the
universe has a
well-defined
history without
any uncertainty.
For this
classical theory,
we have a
fairly complete
picture.
However, as
we've seen,
this theory
can't be quite
right because
we observe that
matter is subject
to uncertainty
and quantum
fluctuations.
We can
therefore ask
the question
about time
travel on a
second level,
that of
semi-classical
theory.
In this,
we consider
matter to
behave according
to quantum
theory,
with uncertainty
and quantum
fluctuations,
but space-time
to be well-defined
and classical.
Here, the picture
is less complete,
but at least we have
some idea of how
to proceed.
Finally, there is
the full quantum
theory of gravity,
whatever that may be.
In this theory,
where not just
matter but also
time and space
themselves are
uncertain and
fluctuate,
it's not even
clear how to
pose the question
of whether
time travel is
possible.
Maybe the best
we can do is
to ask how
people in regions
where space-time
is nearly classical
and free from
uncertainty would
interpret their
measurements.
Would they think
that time travel
had taken place
in regions of
strong gravity
and large
quantum fluctuations?
To start with
the classical
theory,
the flat space-time
of special
relativity,
relativity without
gravity, doesn't
allow time travel,
nor do the
curved space-times
that were known
early on.
It was therefore
a great shock
to Einstein
when, in 1949,
Kurt Gödel,
of Gödel's
theorem,
discovered a
space-time that
was a universe
full of rotating
matter, with time
loops through
every point.
Gödel's
Incompleteness
Theorem
In 1931,
the mathematician
Kurt Gödel
proved his famous
incompleteness
theorem about the
nature of
mathematics.
The theorem
states that
within any
formal system
of axioms,
such as
present-day
mathematics,
questions always
persist that can
neither be proved
or disproved on
the basis of the
axioms that
define the system.
In other words,
Gödel showed that
there are problems
that cannot be
solved by any
set of rules or
procedures.
Gödel's theorem
set fundamental
limits on
mathematics.
It came as a
great shock to
the scientific
community, since it
overthrew the
widespread belief
that mathematics
was a coherent
and complete
system based on
a single logical
foundation.
Gödel's theorem,
together with
Heisenberg's
uncertainty principle
and chaos theory,
form a core set of
limitations to
scientific knowledge
that came to be
appreciated only
during the
twentieth century.
The Gödel's
solution required a
cosmological constant,
which may or may
not exist in nature,
but other solutions
were subsequently
found without a
cosmological constant.
A particularly
interesting case is
one in which two
cosmic strings move
at high speed past
each other.
Cosmic strings
Cosmic strings are
long, heavy objects
with a tiny cross
section that may have
been produced during
the early stages of
the universe.
Once cosmic strings
formed, they were
further stretched by the
expansion of the
universe, and by now a
single cosmic string
could cross over the
entire length of our
observable universe.
The occurrence of
cosmic strings is
suggested by modern
theories of particles
which predict that in
the hot early stages of
the universe, matter
was in a symmetric
phase, much like liquid
water, which is
symmetrical, the same at
every point in every
direction, rather than
like ice crystals, which
have a discrete structure.
When the universe cooled,
the symmetry of the
early phase could have
been broken in different
ways in distant regions.
Consequently, the cosmic
matter would have
settled into different
ground states in those
regions.
Cosmic strings are the
configurations of matter
at the boundaries between
these regions.
Their formation was
therefore an inevitable
consequence of the fact
that different regions
could not agree on their
ground states.
Cosmic strings should not
be confused with the
strings of string theory,
though they are not
entirely unrelated.
They're objects with
length, but a tiny
cross-section.
Their occurrence is
predicted in some
theories of elementary
particles.
The spacetime outside a
single cosmic string is
flat.
However, it's flat
spacetime with a wedge
cut out, with the sharp
end of the wedge at the
string.
It's like a cone.
Take a large circle of
paper and cut out a
segment like a slice of
pie.
A wedge with its corner
at the centre of the
circle.
Then discard the piece
you've cut out and glue
the cut edges of the
remaining piece together
so that you have a
cone.
This represents the
spacetime in which the
cosmic string exists.
Notice that because the
surface of the cone is the
same flat sheet of paper
with which you started,
minus the wedge, you can
still call it flat, except
at the apex.
You can recognise that
there is curvature at the
apex by the fact that a
circle round the apex has
a smaller circumference
than a circle drawn at the
same distance round the
centre of the original
round sheet of paper.
In other words, a circle
round the apex is shorter
than one would expect for a
circle of that radius in
flat space because of the
missing segment.
Similarly, in the case of a
cosmic string, the wedge
that is removed from flat
spacetime shortens circles
round the string but doesn't
affect time or distances
along the string.
This means that the
spacetime around a single
cosmic string doesn't
contain any time loops, so
it's not possible to travel
into the past.
However, if there's a
second cosmic string that
is moving relative to the
first, its time direction
will be a combination of
the time and space
directions of the first.
This means that the wedge
that is cut out for the
second string will shorten
both distances in space and
time intervals as seen by
someone moving with the
first string.
If the cosmic strings are
moving at nearly the speed
of light relative to each
other, the saving of time
going around both strings
can be so great that one
arrives back before one set
out.
In other words, there are
time loops that one can
follow to travel into the
past.
The cosmic string spacetime
contains matter that has
positive energy density and is
consistent with the physics
we know.
However, the warping that
produces the time loops
extends all the way out to
infinity in space and back to
the infinite past in time.
Thus, these spacetimes were
created with time travel in
them.
We have no reason to believe
that our own universe was
created in such a warped
fashion, and we have no
reliable evidence of visitors
from the future.
I'm discounting the conspiracy
theory that UFOs are from the
future and that the government
knows and is covering it up.
Its record of cover-ups is
not that good.
I shall therefore assume that
there were no time loops in
the distant past, or more
precisely, in the past of some
surface through spacetime, that
I shall call S.
The question then is, could some
advanced civilization build a
time machine?
That is, could it modify the
spacetime to the future of S, so
that time loops appeared in a
finite region?
I say a finite region because
no matter how advanced the
civilization becomes, it could
presumably control only a
finite part of the universe.
In science, finding the right
formulation of a problem is
often the key to solving it, and
this was a good example.
To define what was meant by a
finite time machine, I went back
to some early work of mine.
Time travel is possible in a
region of spacetime in which
there are time loops.
Paths that move at less than
the speed of light, but which
nevertheless manage to come
back to the place and time
they started, because of the
warping of spacetime.
Since I have assumed that there
were no time loops in the
distant past, there must be what
I call a time travel horizon, the
boundary separating the region of
time loops from the region
without them.
Time travel horizons are rather
like black hole horizons.
While a black hole horizon is
formed by light rays that just
miss falling into the black
hole, a time travel horizon is
formed by light rays on the
verge of meeting up with
themselves.
I then take as my criterion for
a time machine what I call a
finitely generated horizon.
That is, a horizon which is
formed by light rays that all
emerge from a bounded region.
In other words, they don't come in
from infinity or from a singularity,
but originate from a finite region
containing time loops, the sort
of region our advanced
civilization is supposed to
create.
In adopting this definition as
the footprint of a time machine,
we have the advantage of being
able to use the machinery that
Roger Penrose and I developed to
study singularities and black
holes.
Even without using the Einstein
equations, I can show that in
general, a finitely generated
horizon will contain a light ray that
actually meets up with itself.
That is, a light ray that keeps
coming back to the same point
over and over again.
Each time the light came round, it
would be more and more blue
shifted, so the images would get
bluer and bluer.
The wave crests of a pulse of
light will get closer and closer
together, and the light will get
around in shorter and shorter
intervals of its time.
In fact, a particle of light would
have only a finite history, as
defined by its own measure of time,
even though it went around and
round in a finite region and didn't
hit a curvature singularity.
One might not care if a particle of
light completed its history in a
finite time, but I can also prove
that there would be paths moving at
less than the speed of light that had
only finite duration.
These could be the histories of
observers who would be trapped in a
finite region before the horizon, and
would go around and around faster and
faster until they reached the speed of
light in a finite time.
So, if a beautiful alien in a flying
saucer invites you into her time
machine, step with care.
You might fall into one of these
trapped, repeating histories of only
finite duration.
These results don't depend on the
Einstein equations, but only on the
way space-time would have to warp to
produce time loops in a finite region.
However, we can now ask what kind of
matter an advanced civilization would
have to use to warp space-time so as
to build a finite-sized time machine.
Can it have positive energy density
everywhere, as in the cosmic string
space-time I described earlier?
Cosmic string space-time didn't
satisfy my requirement that the time
loops appear in a finite region.
However, one might think that this was
just because the cosmic strings were
infinitely long.
One might imagine that one could build
a finite time machine using finite
loops of cosmic string, and have the
energy density positive everywhere.
It's a pity to disappoint people, such
as Kip, who want to return to the
past, but it can't be done with
positive energy density everywhere.
I can prove that to build a finite
time machine, you need negative energy.
Energy density is always positive in
classical theory, so time machines of
finite size are ruled out on this level.
However, the situation is different in
the semi-classical theory, in which one
considers matter to behave according to
quantum theory, but space-time to be
well-defined and classical.
As we've seen, the uncertainty principle
of quantum theory means that fields are
always fluctuating up and down, even in
apparently empty space, and have an energy
density that is infinite.
Thus one has to subtract an infinite
quantity to get the finite energy density
that we observe in the universe.
This subtraction can leave the energy
density negative, at least locally.
Even in flat space, one can find quantum
states in which the energy density is
negative locally, although the total
energy is positive.
One might wonder whether these negative
values actually cause space-time to
warp in the appropriate way to build a
finite time machine, but it seems they
must.
As we saw in Chapter 4, quantum
fluctuations mean that even apparently
empty space is full of pairs of virtual
particles that appear together, move
apart, and then come back together and
annihilate each other.
One member of a virtual particle pair will
have positive energy and the other
negative energy.
When a black hole is present, the negative
energy member can fall in and the positive
energy member can escape to infinity, where
it appears as radiation that carries positive
energy away from the black hole.
The negative energy particles falling in
cause the black hole to lose mass and to
evaporate slowly, with its horizon shrinking
in size.
Ordinary matter with positive energy density
has an attractive gravitational effect and
warps space-time to bend light rays toward each
other, just as the ball on the rubber sheet in
Chapter 2 always makes the smaller ball bearings
curve toward it, never away.
This would imply that the area of the horizon of a
black hole could only increase with time, never
shrink.
For the horizon of a black hole to shrink in
size, the energy density on the horizon must be
negative and warp space-time to make light rays
diverge from each other.
This was something I first realized when I was
getting into bed soon after the birth of my
daughter.
I won't say how long ago that was, but I now
have a grandson.
The evaporation of black holes shows that on the
quantum level, the energy density can sometimes be
negative and warp space-time in the direction that
would be needed to build a time machine.
Thus, we might imagine that some very advanced
civilization could arrange things so that the energy
density is sufficiently negative to form a time
machine that could be used by macroscopic objects, such
as spaceships.
However, there's an important difference between a
black hole horizon, which is formed by light rays that
just keep going, and the horizon in a time machine, which
contains closed light rays that keep going around and
around.
A virtual particle moving on such a closed path would
bring its ground state energy back to the same point again
and again.
One would therefore expect the energy density to be infinite
on the horizon, the boundary of the time machine, the region in
which one can travel into the past.
This is borne out by explicit calculations in a few
backgrounds that are simple enough for exact calculations.
It would mean that a person or a space probe that tried to
cross the horizon to get into the time machine would get wiped
out by a bolt of radiation.
So the future looks black for time travel, or should one say
blindingly white.
The energy density of matter depends on the state it is in, so it
is possible that an advanced civilization might be able to make
the energy density finite on the boundary of the time machine by
freezing out or removing the virtual particles that go around and
around in a closed loop.
It's not clear, however, that such a time machine would be stable.
The least disturbance, such as someone crossing the horizon to enter the
time machine, might set off circulating virtual particles and trigger a
bolt of lightning.
This is a question that physicists should be free to discuss without being
laughed to scorn.
Even if it turns out that time travel is impossible, it's important that we
understand why it is impossible.
To answer that question definitely, we need to consider quantum fluctuations, not
only of matter fields, but of space-time itself.
One might expect that these would cause a certain fuzziness in the paths of light
rays and in the whole concept of time ordering.
Indeed, one can regard the radiation from black holes as leaking out because
quantum fluctuations of space-time mean that the horizon is not exactly defined.
Because we don't yet have a complete theory of quantum gravity, it's difficult to say
what the effects of space-time fluctuations should be.
Nevertheless, we can hope to get some pointers from the Feynman sum over histories
described in Chapter 3.
Each history will be a curved space-time with matter fields in it.
Since we're supposed to sum over all possible histories, not just those that satisfy some
equations, the sum must include space-times that are warped enough for travel into the
past.
So the question is, why isn't time travel happening everywhere?
The answer is that time travel is indeed taking place on a microscopic scale, but we don't
notice it.
If one applies the Feynman sum over histories idea to a particle, one has to include histories
in which the particle travels faster than light and even backward in time.
In particular, there will be histories in which the particle goes around and around on a closed
loop in time and space.
It will be like the film Groundhog Day in which a reporter has to live the same day over and
over again.
One can't observe particles with such closed-loop histories directly with a particle detector.
However, the indirect effects have been measured in a number of experiments.
One is a small shift in the light given out by hydrogen atoms, caused by electrons moving
in closed loops.
Another is a small force between parallel metal plates, caused by the fact that there are slightly
fewer closed-loop histories that can fit between the plates, compared to the region outside.
Another equivalent interpretation of the Casimir effect.
Thus, the existence of closed-loop histories is confirmed by experiment.
One might dispute whether closed-loop particle histories have anything to do with the warping
of space-time, because they occur even in fixed backgrounds such as flat space.
But in recent years, we've found that phenomena in physics often have dual, equally valid
descriptions.
One can equally well say that a particle moves on a closed loop in the space.
given fixed background, or that the particle stays fixed, and space and time fluctuate
around it.
It's just a question of whether you do the sum over particle paths first, and then the
sum over curved spacetimes, or vice versa.
It seems, therefore, that quantum theory allows time travel on a microscopic scale.
However, this is not much use for science fiction purposes, such as going back and killing
your grandfather.
The question, therefore, is, can the probability in the sum over histories be peaked around
spacetimes with macroscopic time loops?
One can investigate this question by studying the sum over histories of matter fields in a
series of background spacetimes that get closer and closer to admitting time loops.
One would expect something dramatic to happen when time loops first appear, and this is borne
out in a simple example that I studied with my student, Michael Cassidy.
The background spacetimes in the series we studied were closely related to what is called
the Einstein Universe, the spacetime that Einstein proposed when he believed that the universe
was static and unchanging in time, neither expanding nor contracting.
See chapter 1.
In the Einstein Universe, time runs from the infinite past to the infinite future.
The space directions, however, are finite and close on themselves, like the surface of the
Earth, but with one more dimension.
One can picture this spacetime as a cylinder with the long axis being the time direction
and the cross-section being the three space directions.
The Einstein Universe doesn't represent the universe we live in because it's not expanding.
Nevertheless, it is a convenient background to use when discussing time travel, because it's
simple enough that one can do the sum over histories.
Forgetting about time travel for a moment, consider matter in an Einstein Universe that is rotating
about some axis.
If you were on the axis, you could remain at the same point of space, just as you do when
standing at the center of a children's carousel.
But if you were not on the axis, you would be moving through space as you rotated about
the axis.
The further you were from the axis, the faster you would be moving.
So if the universe were infinite in space, points sufficiently far from the axis would
have to be rotating faster than light.
However, because the Einstein Universe is finite in the space directions, there is a critical
rate of rotation below which no part of the universe is rotating faster than light.
Now consider the sum over particle histories in a rotating Einstein Universe.
When the rotation is slow, there are many paths a particle can take using a given amount
of energy.
Thus, the sum over all particle histories in this background gives a large amplitude.
This means that the probability of this background would be high in the sum over all curved space-time
histories.
That is, it's among the more probable histories.
However, as the rate of rotation of the Einstein Universe approaches the critical value, so
that its outer edges are moving at a speed approaching the speed of light, there is only
one particle path that is classically allowed on that edge, namely, one that is moving at
the speed of light.
This means that the sum over particle histories will be small.
Thus, the probability of these backgrounds will be low in the sum over all curved space-time
histories.
That is, they are the least probable.
What do rotating Einstein Universes have to do with time travel and time loops?
The answer is that they are mathematically equivalent to other backgrounds that do emit time loops.
These other backgrounds are Universes that are expanding in two space directions.
The Universes are not expanding in the third space direction, which is periodic.
That is to say, if you go a certain distance in this direction, you get back to where you
started.
However, each time you do a circuit of the third space direction, your speed in the first
or second directions gets boosted.
If the boost is small, there are no time loops.
However, consider a sequence of backgrounds with increasing boosts in speed.
At a certain critical boost, time loops will appear.
Not surprisingly, this critical boost corresponds to the critical rate of rotation of the Einstein
Universes.
Since the sum over history's calculations in these backgrounds are mathematically equivalent,
one can conclude that the probability of these backgrounds goes to zero as they approach
the warping needed for time loops.
In other words, the probability of having sufficient warping for a time machine is zero.
This supports what I have called the chronology protection conjecture, mentioned at the end
of Chapter 2, that the laws of physics conspire to prevent time travel by macroscopic objects.
Although time loops are allowed by the sum over histories, the probabilities are extremely
small.
Based on the duality arguments I mentioned earlier, I estimate the probability that Kip Thorne could
go back and kill his grandfather as less than one in ten, with a trillion, trillion, trillion,
trillion, trillion, zeros after it.
As gambling men, Kip and I would bet on odds like that.
The trouble is, we can't bet each other because we're now both on the same side.
On the other hand, I wouldn't take a bet with anyone else.
He might be from the future and know that time travel worked.
You might wonder if this chapter is part of a government cover-up on time travel.
You might be right.
Chapter 6
Our Future
Star Trek or not?
How biological and electronic life will go on developing in complexity at an ever-increasing
rate.
The reason Star Trek is so popular is because it's a safe and comforting vision of the future.
I'm a bit of a Star Trek fan myself, so I was easily persuaded to take part in an episode
in which I played poker with Newton, Einstein, and Commander Data.
I beat them all, but unfortunately there was a red alert, so I never collected my winnings.
Star Trek shows a society that is far in advance of ours in science, in technology, and in political
organization.
The last might not be difficult.
There must have been great changes, with their accompanying tensions and upsets, in the time
between now and then.
But in the period we're shown, science, technology, and the organization of society are supposed
to have achieved a level of near perfection.
I want to question this picture and ask if we will ever reach a final, steady state in
science and technology.
At no time in the ten thousand years or so since the last Ice Age has the human race been
in a state of constant knowledge and fixed technology.
There have been a few setbacks, like the Dark Ages after the fall of the Roman Empire, but
the world's population, which is a measure of our technological ability to preserve life
and feed ourselves, has risen steadily, with only a few hiccups, such as the Black Death.
In the last two hundred years, population growth has become exponential.
That is, the population grows by the same percentage each year.
Currently, the rate is about 1.9% a year.
That may not sound like very much, but it means that the world population doubles every forty years.
Other measures of technological development in recent times are electricity consumption
and the number of scientific articles.
They too show exponential growth, with doubling times of less than forty years.
There's no sign that scientific and technological development will slow down and stop in the
near future, certainly not by the time of Star Trek, which is supposed to be not that far
in the future.
But if the population growth and the increase in the consumption of electricity continue at
their current rates, by 2,600, the world's population will be standing shoulder to shoulder
and electricity use will make the Earth glow red-hot.
If you stacked all the new books being published next to each other, you would have to move at
ninety miles an hour just to keep up with the end of the line.
Of course, by 2,600, new artistic and scientific work will come in electronic forms, rather
than as physical books and papers.
Nevertheless, if the exponential growth continued, there would be ten papers a second in my kind
of theoretical physics, and no time to read them.
Clearly, the present exponential growth can't continue indefinitely.
So what will happen?
One possibility is that we'll wipe ourselves out completely by some disaster, such as a
nuclear war.
There's a sick joke that the reason we've not been contacted by extraterrestrials is that
when a civilization reaches our stage of development, it becomes unstable and destroys itself.
However, I'm an optimist.
I don't believe the human race has come so far just to snuff itself out when things are
getting interesting.
The Star Trek vision of the future, that we achieve an advanced but essentially static
level, may come true in respect of our knowledge of the basic laws that govern the universe.
As I shall describe in the next chapter, there may be an ultimate theory that we'll discover
in the not-too-distant future.
This ultimate theory, if it exists, will determine whether the Star Trek dream of warp drive can be
realized.
According to present ideas, we shall have to explore the galaxy in a slow and tedious manner,
using spaceships traveling slower than light.
But since we don't yet have a complete unified theory, we can't quite rule out warp drive.
On the other hand, we already know the laws that hold in all but the most extreme situations,
the laws that govern the crew of the Enterprise, if not the spaceship itself.
Yet it doesn't seem that we'll ever reach a steady state in the uses we make of these laws,
or in the complexity of the systems that we can produce with them.
It is with this complexity that the rest of this chapter will be concerned.
By far the most complex systems that we have are our own bodies.
Life seems to have originated in the primordial oceans that covered the Earth four billion years
ago.
How this happened, we don't know.
It may be that random collisions between atoms built up macromolecules that could reproduce
themselves and assemble themselves into more complicated structures.
What we do know is that by three and a half billion years ago, the highly complicated DNA molecule
had emerged.
DNA is the basis for all life on Earth.
It has a double helix structure, like a spiral staircase, which was discovered by Francis Crick
and James Watson in the Cavendish lab at Cambridge in 1953.
The two strands of the double helix are linked by pairs of nucleic acids, like the treads in
a spiral staircase.
There are four kinds of nucleic acids, cytosine, guanine, tyrosine, and adenosine.
The order in which the different nucleic acids occur along the spiral staircase carries the
genetic information that enables the DNA molecule to assemble an organism around it and reproduce
itself.
As the DNA makes copies of itself, there are occasional errors in the order of the nucleic
acids along the spiral.
In most cases, the mistakes in copying make the DNA either unable or less likely to reproduce
itself, meaning that such genetic errors or mutations, as they're called, will die out.
But in a few cases, the error or mutation will increase the chances of the DNA surviving and
reproducing.
Such changes in the genetic code will be favoured.
This is how the information contained in the sequence of nucleic acids gradually evolves and
increases in complexity.
Because biological evolution is basically a random walk in the space of all genetic possibilities,
it's been very slow.
The complexity, or numbers of bits of information that is coded in DNA, is roughly the number of
nucleic acids in the molecule.
For the first two billion years or so, the rate of increase in complexity must have been of
the order of one bit of information every hundred years.
The rate of increase of DNA complexity gradually rose to about one bit a year over the last
few million years.
But then, about six or eight thousand years ago, a major new development occurred.
We developed written language.
This meant that information could be passed from one generation to the next without having
to wait for the very slow process of random mutations and natural selection to code it into
the DNA sequence.
The amount of complexity increased enormously.
A single paperback romance could hold as much information as the difference in the DNA between
apes and humans, and a thirty-volume encyclopedia could describe the entire sequence of human DNA.
Even more important, the information in books can be updated rapidly.
The current rate at which human DNA is being updated by biological evolution is about one bit a year.
But there are two hundred thousand new books published each year, a new information rate
of over a million bits a second.
Of course, most of this information is garbage, but even if only one bit in a million is useful,
that is still a hundred thousand times faster than biological evolution.
This transmission of data through external, non-biological means has led the human race to
dominate the world and to have an exponentially increasing population.
But now we are at the beginning of a new era, in which we'll be able to increase the complexity
of our internal record, the DNA, without having to wait for the slow process of biological evolution.
There has been no significant change in human DNA in the last ten thousand years,
but it is likely that we'll be able to completely redesign it in the next thousand.
Of course, many people will say the genetic engineering of humans should be banned,
but it's doubtful we'll be able to prevent it.
Genetic engineering of plants and animals will be allowed for economic reasons,
and someone is bound to try it on humans.
Unless we have a totalitarian world order, someone somewhere will design improved humans.
Clearly, creating improved humans will create great social and political problems
with respect to unimproved humans.
My intention is not to defend human genetic engineering as a desirable development,
but just to say it's likely to happen whether we want it or not.
This is the reason why I don't believe science fiction like Star Trek,
where people 400 years into the future are essentially the same as we are today.
I think the human race and its DNA will increase its complexity quite rapidly.
We should recognize that this is likely to happen and consider how we'll deal with it.
In a way, the human race needs to improve its mental and physical qualities
if it's to deal with the increasingly complex world around it
and meet new challenges, such as space travel.
Humans also need to increase their complexity
if biological systems are to keep ahead of electronic ones.
At the moment, computers have the advantage of speed,
but they show no sign of intelligence.
This is not surprising,
because our present computers are less complex
than the brain of an earthworm,
a species not noted for its intellectual powers.
But computers obey what is known as Moore's Law.
Their speed and complexity double every 18 months.
It's one of those exponential growths that clearly can't continue indefinitely.
However, it will probably continue
until computers have a complexity similar to that of the human brain.
Some people say that computers can never show true intelligence,
whatever that may be.
But it seems to me that if very complicated chemical molecules
can operate in humans to make them intelligent,
then equally complicated electronic circuits
can also make computers act in an intelligent way.
And if they're intelligent,
they can presumably design computers
that have an even greater complexity and intelligence.
Will this increase of biological and electronic complexity
go on forever, or is there a natural limit?
On the biological side,
the limit on human intelligence up to now
has been set by the size of the brain
that will pass through the birth canal.
Having watched my three children being born,
I know how difficult it is for the head to get out.
But within the next hundred years,
I expect we'll be able to grow babies outside the human body,
so this limitation will be removed.
Ultimately, however,
increases in the size of the human brain,
through genetic engineering,
will come up against the problem
that the body's chemical messengers,
responsible for our mental activity,
are relatively slow-moving.
This means that further increases
in the complexity of the brain
will be at the expense of speed.
We can be quick-witted,
or very intelligent,
but not both.
Still,
I think we can become a lot more intelligent
than most of the people in Star Trek.
Not that that might be difficult.
Electronic circuits have the same complexity
versus speed problem
as the human brain.
In this case, however,
the signals are electrical,
not chemical,
and travel at the speed of light,
which is much higher.
Nevertheless,
the speed of light is already
a practical limit
on the design of faster computers.
One can improve the situation
by making the circuits smaller,
but ultimately,
there'll be a limit set
by the atomic nature of matter.
Still,
we have some way to go
before we meet that barrier.
Another way
in which electronic circuits
can increase their complexity
while maintaining speed
is to copy the human brain.
The brain
does not have a single CPU,
central processing unit,
that processes each command
in sequence.
Rather,
it has millions of processors
working together
at the same time.
Such massively parallel processing
will be the future
for electronic intelligence as well.
Assuming we don't destroy ourselves
in the next hundred years,
it is likely that we'll spread out
first to the planets
in the solar system
and then to the nearby stars.
But it won't be like
Star Trek or Babylon 5
with a new race
of nearly human beings
in almost every stellar system.
The human race
has been in its present form
for only two million years
out of 15 billion years or so
since the Big Bang.
The Biological Electronic Interface
Within two decades,
a thousand-dollar computer
may be as complex
as the human brain.
Parallel processes
could mimic the way
our brain works
and make computers
act in intelligent
and conscious ways.
Neural implants
may allow a much faster interface
between the brain
and computers,
dissolving the distance
between biological
and electronic intelligence.
In the near future,
most business transactions
will probably be made
between cyber personalities
via the World Wide Web.
Within a decade,
many of us
may even choose
to live a virtual existence
on the net,
forming cyber friendships
and relationships.
Our understanding
of the human genome
will undoubtedly create
great medical advances,
but it will also enable us
to increase the complexity
of the human DNA structure
significantly.
In the next few hundred years,
human genetic engineering
will replace biological evolution,
redesigning the human race
and posing entirely new
ethical questions.
Space travel
beyond our solar system
will probably require
either genetically engineered humans
or unmanned,
computer-controlled probes.
So even if life develops
in other stellar systems,
the chances of catching it
at a recognizably human stage
are very small.
Any alien life we encounter
will likely be either
much more primitive
or much more advanced.
If it is more advanced,
why hasn't it spread
through the galaxy
and visited Earth?
If aliens had come here,
it should have been more obvious,
more like the film
Independence Day
than E.T.
So how does one account
for our lack
of extraterrestrial visitors?
It could be
that there is
an advanced race out there
which is aware
of our existence,
but is leaving us
to stew
in our own
primitive juices.
However,
it is doubtful
it would be so considerate
to a lower life form.
Do most of us worry
about how many insects
and earthworms
we squash underfoot?
A more reasonable explanation
is that there is
a very low probability
either of life developing
on other planets
or of that life
developing intelligence.
Because we claim
to be intelligent,
though perhaps
without much ground,
we tend to see intelligence
as an inevitable
consequence of evolution.
However,
one can question that.
It's not clear
that intelligence
has much survival value.
Bacteria do very well
without intelligence
and will survive us
if our so-called intelligence
causes us
to wipe ourselves out
in a nuclear war.
So,
as we explore the galaxy,
we may find
primitive life,
but we're not likely
to find beings
like us.
The future of science
won't be like
the comforting picture
painted in Star Trek,
a universe
populated by many
humanoid races
with an advanced
but essentially static
science and technology.
Instead,
I think
we'll be on our own,
but rapidly developing
in biological
and electronic complexity.
Not much of this
will happen
in the next hundred years,
which is all
we can reliably predict,
but by the end
of the next millennium,
if we get there,
the difference
from Star Trek
will be fundamental.
Chapter 7
Brain New World
Do we live
on a brain
or are we
just holograms?
How will our
journey of discovery
proceed in the future?
Will we succeed
in our quest
for a complete
unified theory
that will govern
the universe
and everything
that it contains?
In fact,
as described
in Chapter 2,
we may have already
identified the
theory of everything,
T-O-E,
as M-theory.
This theory
doesn't have
a single formulation,
at least as far
as we know.
Instead,
we've discovered
a network
of apparently
different theories
which all seem
to be approximations
to the same
underlying fundamental
theory
in different limits,
just as Newton's
theory of gravity
is an approximation
to Einstein's
general theory
of relativity
in the limit
that the gravitational
field is weak.
M-theory
is like a jigsaw.
It's easiest
to identify
and fit together
the pieces
round the edges
of the jigsaw,
the limits of M-theory
where some quantity
or other is small.
We now have
a fairly good idea
of these edges,
but there is still
a gaping hole
at the centre
of the M-theory jigsaw
where we don't know
what's going on.
We can't really claim
to have found
the theory of everything
until we have
filled that hole.
What is in
the centre of M-theory?
Will we discover
dragons
or something
equally strange
like on old maps
of unexplored lands?
Our experience
in the past
suggests we are
likely to find
unexpected new phenomena
whenever we extend
the range of our
observations
to smaller scales.
At the beginning
of the 20th century,
we understood
the workings of nature
on the scales
of classical physics,
which is good
from interstellar distances
down to about
a hundredth of a millimetre.
Classical physics
assumes that matter
is a continuous medium
with properties
like elasticity
and viscosity.
But evidence
began to emerge
that matter
is not smooth
but grainy.
It's made of
tiny building blocks
called atoms.
The word atom
comes from Greek
and means indivisible,
but it was soon found
that atoms
consisted of electrons
orbiting a nucleus
made up of protons
and neutrons.
The work
on atomic physics
in the first
thirty years
of the 20th century
took our understanding
down to lengths
of a millionth
of a millimetre.
Then we discovered
that protons
and neutrons
are made of even
smaller particles
called quarks.
Our recent research
on nuclear
and high-energy physics
has taken us
to length scales
that are smaller
by a further factor
of a billion.
It might seem
that we could go on
forever discovering
structures on smaller
and smaller length scales.
However,
there is a limit
to this series,
as there is
to the series
of Russian dolls
within Russian dolls.
Eventually,
one gets down
to a smallest doll,
which can't be
taken apart anymore.
In physics,
the smallest doll
is called
the plunk length.
To probe
to shorter distances
would require particles
of such high energy
that they were
inside black holes.
We don't know
exactly what
the fundamental
plunk length is
in M-theory,
but it might be
as small as
a millimetre
divided by
a hundred thousand
billion,
billion,
billion.
We are not about
to build
particle accelerators
that can probe
to distances
that small.
They would have
to be larger
than the solar system,
and they're not
likely to be approved
in the present
financial climate.
However,
there has been
an exciting new
development that means
we might discover
at least some
of the dragons
of M-theory
more easily
and cheaply.
As explained
in chapters 2 and 3,
in the M-theory
network of
mathematical models,
space-time has
ten or eleven
dimensions.
Up to recently,
it was thought
that the six or seven
extra dimensions
would all be curled
up very small.
It would be like
a human hair.
If you look at a hair
under a magnifying glass,
you can see it has
thickness,
but to the naked eye,
it just appears
like a line
with length
but no other dimension.
Space-time
may be similar.
On human,
atomic,
or even nuclear
physics length scales,
it may appear
four-dimensional
and nearly flat.
On the other hand,
if we probe
to very short distances
using extremely
high-energy particles,
we should see
that space-time
was ten or eleven
dimensional.
Brain worlds.
If all the additional
dimensions were
very small,
it would be very
difficult to observe them.
However,
there has recently
been the suggestion
that one or more
of the extra dimensions
might be comparatively
large or even
infinite.
This idea
has the great advantage,
at least to a positivist
like me,
that it may be
testable by the next
generation of particle
accelerators
or by sensitive
short-range measurements
of the gravitational
force.
Such observations
could either
falsify the theory
or experimentally
confirm the presence
of other dimensions.
Large extra dimensions
are an exciting
new development
in our search
for the ultimate
model or theory.
They would imply
that we lived
in a brain world,
a four-dimensional
surface or brain
in a higher
dimensional space-time.
Matter and
non-gravitational
forces,
like the electric
force,
would be confined
to the brain.
Thus,
everything not
involving gravity
would behave
as it would
in four dimensions.
In particular,
the electric force
between the nucleus
of an atom
and the electrons
orbiting around it
would fall off
with distance
at the right rate
for atoms to be stable
against the electrons
falling into the nucleus.
This would be
in accordance
with the
anthropic principle
that the universe
must be suitable
for intelligent life.
If atoms
weren't stable,
we wouldn't be here
to observe the universe
and ask why it appears
four-dimensional.
On the other hand,
gravity in the form
of curved space
would permeate
the whole bulk
of the higher
dimensional space-time.
This would mean
that gravity
would behave differently
from other forces
we experience.
Because gravity
would spread out
in the extra dimensions,
it would fall off
more rapidly
with distance
than one would expect.
If this more rapid
fall-off
of the gravitational force
extended to
astronomical distances,
we would have noticed
its effect
on the orbits
of the planets.
In fact,
they would be unstable
as was remarked
in Chapter 3.
The planets
would either fall
into the Sun
or escape
to the dark
and cold
of interstellar space.
However,
this would not happen
if the extra dimensions
ended on another brain
not that far away
from the brain
on which we live.
Then,
for distances
greater than
the separation
of the brains,
gravity would not
be able to spread
out freely
but would effectively
be confined
to the brain,
like the electric forces,
and fall off
at the right rate
for planetary orbits.
On the other hand,
for distances
less than the separation
of the brains,
gravity would vary
more rapidly.
The very small
gravitational field
between heavy objects
has been measured
accurately in the lab,
but the experiments
so far
would not have detected
the effects of brains
separated by less
than a few inches.
New measurements
are now being made
at shorter distances.
In this brain world,
we would live
on one brain,
but there would be
another shadow brain
nearby.
Because light
would be confined
to the brains
and would not propagate
through the space
between,
we couldn't see
the shadow world,
but we would feel
the gravitational influence
of matter
on the shadow brain.
In our brain,
such gravitational forces
would appear
to be produced
by sources
that were truly dark,
in that the only way
we could detect them
is through their gravity.
In fact,
in order to explain
the rate at which
stars orbit
the center of our galaxy,
it seems
there must be
more mass
than is accounted for
by the matter
we observe.
Evidence for dark matter
Various cosmological
observations
strongly suggest
that there should be
much more matter
in our galaxy
and other galaxies
than we see.
The most convincing
of these observations
is that stars
on the outskirts
of spiral galaxies,
like our own Milky Way,
orbit far too fast
to be held
in their orbits
only by the gravitational
attraction
of all the stars
we observe.
We've known
since the 1970s
that there is
a discrepancy
between the observed
rotational velocities
of stars
in the outer regions
of spiral galaxies
and the orbit velocities
that one would expect,
according to Newton's laws,
from the distribution
of the visible stars
in the galaxy.
This indicates
that there should be
much more matter
in the outer parts
of the spiral galaxies.
The nature
of dark matter
Cosmologists
now believe
that while the central
parts of spiral galaxies
consist largely
of ordinary stars,
their outskirts
are dominated
by dark matter
that we can't see directly.
One of the fundamental
problems for cosmology
today
is to discover
the dominant form
of dark matter
in the outer regions
of galaxies.
Before the 1980s,
it was usually assumed
that this dark matter
was ordinary matter
comprised of protons,
neutrons,
and electrons
in some not readily
detectable form,
perhaps gas clouds
or machos,
massive,
compact halo objects
like white dwarfs
or neutron stars
or even black holes.
However,
recent study
of the formation
of galaxies
has led cosmologists
to believe
that a significant
fraction of the dark matter
must be in a different form
from ordinary matter.
Perhaps it arises
from the masses
of very light
elementary particles
such as axions
and neutrinos.
It may even consist
of more exotic
species of particles
such as WIMPs
that are predicted
by modern theories
of elementary particles
but have not yet
been detected
experimentally.
This missing mass
might arise
from some exotic
species of particle
in our world
such as WIMPs,
weakly interacting
massive particles,
or axions,
very light
elementary particles.
But missing mass
could also be evidence
of the existence
of a shadow world
with matter in it.
Maybe it contains
shallow human beings
wondering about
the mass that seems
to be missing
from their world
to account for the orbits
of shadow stars
around the centre
of the shadow galaxy.
Instead of the extra dimension
ending on a second brain,
another possibility
is that they are infinite
but highly curved,
like a saddle.
Lisa Randall
and Raman Sundram
showed that this kind
of curvature
would act like
a second brain.
The gravitational influence
of an object
on the brain
would be confined
to a small neighbourhood
of the brain
and not spread out
to infinity
in the extra dimensions.
Like in the shadow brain model,
the gravitational field
would have the right
long-distance fall-off
to explain planetary orbits
and lab measurements
of the gravitational force,
but gravity
would vary more rapidly
at short distances.
There is, however,
an important difference
between this Randall syndrome model
and the shadow brain model.
Bodies that move
under the influence
of gravity
will produce
gravitational waves,
ripples of curvature
that travel through
space-time
at the speed of light.
Like the electromagnetic
waves of light,
gravitational waves
should carry energy,
a prediction
that has been confirmed
by observations
of the binary pulsar PSR.
Binary pulsars
General relativity predicts
that heavy bodies
moving under the influence
of gravity
emit gravitational waves.
Like light waves,
gravitational waves
carry energy away
from the objects
that emit them.
However,
the rate of energy loss
is usually extremely low,
hence very difficult
to observe.
For instance,
the emission
of gravitational waves
is causing the Earth
to slowly spiral in
toward the Sun,
but it will take
another 10 to the 27th power years
for them to collide.
But in 1975,
Russell Hulse
and Joseph Taylor
discovered the binary pulsar
PSR 1913 plus 16,
a system consisting
of two compact neutron stars
orbiting each other
with a maximum separation
of only one solar radius.
According to general relativity,
the rapid motion
means that the orbital period
of the system
should decrease
on a much shorter timescale
because of the emission
of a strong
gravitational wave signal.
The change predicted
by general relativity
is in excellent agreement
with careful observations
by Hulse and Taylor
of the orbital parameters,
which indicate
that since 1975,
the period has shortened
by more than 10 seconds.
In 1993,
they were awarded
the Nobel Prize
for this confirmation
of general relativity.
If we indeed live
on a brain
in a space-time
with extra dimensions,
gravitational waves
generated by the motion
of bodies on the brain
would travel off
into the other dimensions.
They would be reflected back
if there were
a second shadow brain
and trapped
between the two brains.
On the other hand,
if there was only
a single brain
and the extra dimensions
went on forever,
like in the Randall Syndrome model,
gravitational waves
could escape altogether
and carry away energy
from our brain world.
This would seem
to breach
one of the fundamental
principles of physics,
the law of conservation
of energy.
The total amount
of energy
remains the same.
However,
it appears to be
a violation
only because our view
of what is happening
is restricted
to the brain.
An angel
who could see
the extra dimensions
would know
that the energy
was the same,
just more spread out.
The gravitational waves
produced by two stars
orbiting each other
would have a wavelength
which would be
much longer
than the radius
of the saddle-shaped
curvature
in the extra dimensions.
This would mean
they would tend
to be confined
to a small neighborhood
of the brain,
like gravitational force,
and wouldn't spread out
much into the extra dimensions
or carry away
much energy
from the brain.
On the other hand,
gravitational waves
that were shorter
than the scale
on which the extra dimensions
are curved
would escape easily
from the vicinity
of the brain.
The only sources
of significant amounts
of short gravitational waves
are likely to be
black holes.
A black hole
on the brain
will extend
to a black hole
in the extra dimensions.
If the black hole
is small,
it will be almost round,
that is,
will reach about
as far into
the extra dimensions
as its size
on the brain.
On the other hand,
a large black hole
on the brain
will extend
to a black pancake,
which is confined
to a vicinity
of the brain
and which is
much less thick
in the extra dimensions
than it is wide
on the brain.
As explained
in Chapter 4,
quantum theory
means that black holes
won't be completely black.
They'll emit
particles and radiation
of all kinds
like hot bodies.
The particles
and radiation
like light
would be emitted
along the brain
because matter
and non-gravitational forces
like electricity
would be confined
to the brain.
However,
black holes
also emit
gravitational waves.
These
would not be
confined to the brain
but would travel
in the extra dimension
as well.
If the black hole
was large
and pancake-like,
the gravitational waves
would stay
near the brain.
This would mean
that the black hole
would lose energy
and therefore mass
by E
equals mc squared
at the rate
one would expect
for a black hole
in four-dimensional
space-time.
The black hole
would therefore
slowly evaporate
and shrink in size
until it became
smaller than the radius
of curvature
of the saddle-like
extra dimensions.
At this point,
the gravitational waves
emitted by the black hole
would begin to escape
freely into the
extra dimensions.
To someone on the brain,
the black hole,
or dark star
as Mitchell called it,
would appear to be
emitting dark radiation.
Radiation
that can't be observed
directly on the brain
but whose existence
could be inferred
from the fact
that the black hole
was losing mass.
It would mean
that the final burst
of radiation
from an evaporating
black hole
would appear
less powerful
than it actually was.
This could be
why we've not observed
bursts of gamma rays
that can be ascribed
to dying black holes,
though the other,
more prosaic explanation
would be that
there aren't many
black holes
with mass low enough
to evaporate
at the age of the universe
so far.
The radiation
from brain world
black holes
arises from
quantum fluctuations
of particles
on and off a brain,
but brains,
like everything else
in the universe,
will be subject
to quantum fluctuations
themselves.
These can cause brains
to appear
and disappear spontaneously.
The quantum creation
of a brain
would be a bit like
the formation of bubbles
of steam
in boiling water.
Liquid water
consists of billions
and billions
of H2O molecules
packed together
with couplings
between nearest neighbors.
As the water
is heated up,
the molecules
move faster
and bounce off
each other.
Occasionally,
these collisions
will give molecules
such high velocities
that a group of them
will break free
of their bonds
and form a little bubble
of steam
surrounded by water.
The bubble
will then grow
or shrink
in a random manner,
with more molecules
from the liquid
joining the steam
or vice versa.
Most small bubbles
of steam
will collapse
to liquid again,
but a few will grow
to a certain critical size
beyond which the bubbles
are almost certain
to continue to grow.
It is these large
expanding bubbles
that one observes
when water boils.
The behavior
of brain worlds
would be similar.
The uncertainty principle
would allow brain worlds
to appear from nothing
as bubbles
with the brain
forming the surface
of the bubble
and the interior
being the higher
dimensional space.
Very small bubbles
would tend to collapse
again to nothing,
but a bubble
that grew by quantum fluctuations
beyond a certain critical size
would be likely
to keep on growing.
People,
such as us,
living on the brain,
the surface of the bubble,
would think the universe
was expanding.
It would be like
painting galaxies
on the surface
of a balloon
and blowing it up.
The galaxies
would move apart,
but no galaxy
would be picked out
as the center of expansion.
Let's hope
there's no one
with a cosmic pin
to deflate the bubble.
According to the
no-boundary proposal
described in Chapter 3,
the spontaneous creation
of a brain world
would have a history
in imaginary time
which was like a nutshell.
That is,
it would be
a four-dimensional sphere
like the surface
of the Earth,
but with two more dimensions.
The important difference
is that the nutshell
described in Chapter 3
was essentially hollow.
The four-dimensional sphere
wouldn't have been
the boundary of anything,
and the other six
or seven dimensions
of space-time
that M-theory predicts
would all be curled up
even smaller
than the nutshell.
On the new brain world
picture, however,
the nutshell would be filled.
The history
in imaginary time
of the brain
on which we live
would be a four-dimensional sphere
which would be
the boundary
of a five-dimensional bubble
with the remaining
five or six dimensions
curled up very small.
This history of the brain
in imaginary time
would determine
its history
in real time.
In real time,
the brain would expand
in an accelerated
inflationary manner
like that described
in Chapter 3.
A perfectly smooth
and round nutshell
would be the most probable
history of the bubble
in imaginary time.
However,
it would correspond
to a brain
that expanded forever
in an inflationary way
in real time.
Galaxies wouldn't form
on such a brain,
and so intelligent life
would not have developed.
On the other hand,
imaginary time histories
that are not perfectly smooth
and round
would have somewhat
lower probabilities,
but could correspond
to real-time behavior
in which the brain
had a phase
of accelerating
inflationary expansion
at first,
but then began
to slow down.
During this
decelerating expansion,
galaxies could have formed
and intelligent life
might have developed.
Thus,
according to the
anthropic principle
described in Chapter 3,
it is only the
slightly hairy
nutshells
which will be observed
by intelligent beings
asking why the origin
of the universe
wasn't perfectly smooth.
As the brain expanded,
the volume of the
higher-dimensional space
inside would increase.
Eventually,
there would be
an enormous bubble
surrounded by the brain
on which we live.
But do we really
live on the brain?
According to the idea
of holography
described in Chapter 2,
information about
what happens
in a region of space-time
can be encoded
on its boundary.
So maybe we think
we live in a
four-dimensional world
because we are shadows
cast on the brain
by what is happening
in the interior
of the bubble.
However,
from a positivist viewpoint,
one can't ask
which is reality,
brain or bubble.
They are both
mathematical models
that describe
the observations.
One is free to use
whichever model
is most convenient.
What is outside the brain?
There are several possibilities.
One,
there may be
nothing outside.
Although a bubble of steam
has water outside it,
this is just an analogy
to help us visualize
the origin of the universe.
One could imagine
a mathematical model
that was just a brain
with a higher
dimensional space inside,
but absolutely nothing outside,
not even empty space.
One can calculate
what the mathematical model
predicts
without reference
to what is outside.
Two,
one could have
a mathematical model
in which the outside
of a bubble
was glued to the outside
of a similar bubble.
This model
is actually
mathematically equivalent
to the possibility
discussed above
that there is nothing
outside the bubble.
But the difference
is psychological.
People feel happier
being placed
in the center of space-time
rather than on its edge.
But for a positivist,
possibilities one and two
are the same.
Three,
the bubble might expand
into a space
that was not a mirror image
of what was inside the bubble.
This possibility
is different
to the two discussed above
and is more like
the case of boiling water.
Other bubbles
could form and expand.
If they collided
and merged with the bubble
in which we lived,
the results
could be catastrophic.
It has even been suggested
that the Big Bang itself
may have been produced
by a collision
between brains.
Brain world models
like this
are a hot topic
of research.
They are highly speculative,
but they offer
new kinds of behavior
which can be tested
by observation.
They could explain
why gravity
seems to be so weak.
Gravity might be quite strong
in the fundamental theory,
but the spreading
of the gravitational force
in the extra dimensions
would mean
it would be weak
at large distances
on the brain
on which we live.
A consequence of this
would be that
the Planck length,
the smallest distance
to which we can probe
without creating
a black hole,
would be quite a lot larger
than it would appear
from the weakness
of gravity
on our four-dimensional brain.
The smallest Russian doll
wouldn't be so tiny
after all
and might be within
the reach of particle
accelerators of the future.
In fact,
we might already
have discovered
the smallest doll,
the fundamental Planck length,
if the US hadn't gone
through a fit of feeling
poor in 1994
and cancelled the SSC,
the Superconducting
Supercollider,
even though it was
half-built.
Other particle accelerators,
such as the LHC,
Large Hadron Collider
at Geneva,
are now being built.
With them
and other observations,
such as the cosmic
microwave background radiation,
we may be able
to determine
whether or not
we live on a brain.
If we do,
it will presumably be
because the
anthropic principle
picks out brain models
from the vast zoo
of universes
allowed by M-theory.
We could well
paraphrase Miranda
in Shakespeare's
The Tempest,
O brain new world
that has such
creatures in it.
That
is the universe
in a nutshell.
