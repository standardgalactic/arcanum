this is the active podcast where we provide short clips from the active inference institute weekly
live streams if you want to take a deeper dive into this material check out the entire live
stream at the active inference institute youtube channel the link to the live stream is provided in
the episode description i am blue knight the host and curator of this episode which is clipped from
live stream number 13.2 this discussion is based on the 2020 paper entitled integrating cybernetic
big five theory with the free energy principle a new strategy for modeling personalities as complex
systems by adam saffron and colin de young daniel friedman is going to start us off and facilitate
our discussion it's really interesting that it's uh big five is not the essence of an individual
it's actually in a cybernetic framework making the individual's phenotype in relationship to the goals
and the context of their niche so it actually moves away from some of the essentialist types of
critiques that people might naively bring up against big five we're looking at this as an empirical
pattern with a generative underlying cybernetic reality so scott then adam then anyone else
thank you hello everyone my name is scott david i'm at the university of washington applied physics
lab where i'm the director of the information risk research initiative the couple of observations one
personality is for a person and so it's kind of interesting when we take personality and pose it
on other systems right i'm just playing linguistics there a little bit but in a way we what is the
delta between personality and living formality i wonder so that might be in because are we assuming
the human elements again it's that subjectivity question one of the things also it it occurred to
me that friston it kind of allows for a notion of situated personality beyond situated cognition
and so maybe those are overlapping maybe they're not i'm not sure if all um personality uh elements
are seen as cognitive or if there's some things that are you know or effective and hormonal and
whatever other causation chains there are so it's interesting that the um the behavioral elements
that we ascribe to personality um may or may i mean i may not drive uh through all living systems i tend
to define living systems and it's not anything reasoned it's just what i've done for the last 10
years and it's been effective for me is i define living systems as autocatalytic and entropy secreting
so they can be in a variety of different forms and so i think of markets and corporations as living
systems and so to me one of the questions that with with the definitions in the friston notion we have
kind of a fractal notion of uh things that are show scale independence i guess is one of the elements
of fractal systems and so to what extent can the definition of using these personality traits
at different levels help us understand the scale independent possibilities there
so that's one issue then the last point these are kind of random but i think they're clustered
around the idea of the model ascribing the last one is you know when we talk if i'm talking to
daniel there's at least four identities involved there my sense of me his sense of me his sense of
him and my sense of him so one of the challenges when you're talking to corporations markets maybe
not dogs because they may have quality is that the other um the other entity doesn't have qualia if
you're talking to a corporation it does not have qualia the people in the corporation have qualia
but but the corporation itself does not and so the um that's obviously we can talk about that but
my point is if they don't have qualia can they have empathy and if they don't have empathy maybe
there are differences in kind up the friston stack of fractal stack of living things and so maybe that
is one way to start to distinguish between markets and corporations and again gets back to the animals
issue do animals have qualia is the quality of their qualia slightly different than ours
such that maybe there's a subset of personality that they show things like that um anyway just a
couple of random thoughts i think but they again that definition of living beings i think is bound up in
here and again not being too us not being too stubborn in our perspective that the personality
is something that would describe all the attributes that work up and down the biological stack
thanks cool we got adam then stephen marco collin
uh hi i'm adam saffron i'm a postdoctoral researcher out of bloomington indiana with relation to what scott
was saying i think that's actually uh yeah so i don't want to also like while i'm interested in
seeing like how far we can stretch personality i wouldn't want to overstate it either because
there were uh major transitions in evolution and you know one of them would be um basically
the ability to have certain types of generative modeling where there might be a qualia and quality
of different varieties and then we might go beyond that not just qualia but things like
access consciousness and if you like that distinction i do like being able to uh know your experience and
report on it and things like being auto noetic and being able to reflect on even your knowing um
and so this would be very different cybernetic systems once you introduce this um so like you can
have like and and if you have something like the big five showing up or the big 10 or the medium 10 i
don't know what you want to say but um they might show up differently so like you can think of like
generalized agreeableness as like tendencies towards like non-zero um interaction and like
not defecting in generalized game theory something like that like in a multi-agent context you're more
of a cooperator and you you coordinate better but very different thing if you're actually having
something like the feeling of compassion or empathy um these are different processes getting into the mix
and you want a different handling and some things might not actually you want a very different
handling yep interesting like would rather somebody act compassionately and be perceived as high
percentile compassion or perceived overwhelming experience of compassion um steven marco colin blut
hello i'm steven i'm based in toronto i'm doing a practice-based phd at the salman school institute of
applied psychology yeah this brings in the idea of um how people um relate in a task-based environment or
a more task-orientated environment i suppose where it might structure things a bit more clearly
between the things in the world where the person is and whatever mechanism or structure
is interacting between the two i am i picking up a tool am i there's some sort of delineation and one
thing that sort of comes to mind when we talk about so you've got the generative model you've got these
hidden states of the world and you've got this markov blanket and the thing with the markov blanket is
unlike it's not a system boundary you never can really define it so you've got this and what i
thought was quite interesting really when you by having the stability and plasticity i'm seeing sort
of the the plasticity with this um extroversion which you could say is like influencing the hidden
states in a way you're perturbing out there and the um the intellect is making models is is the sort
of the other side but the the the the um stability in some ways is really stabilizing with the markov
blanket like the the nature of the regime because you've kind of got you know neuroticism is it like
a is it a very hilly landscape of actually like inferring so it maybe we because i'm really interested
in how we might have mental space psychology approaches which there might be some sort of intervening
um spatial mediator to how we process and that spatial mediator of how big and scary things are
around us and in our metaphors it could be sort of mediating so the neuroticism the agreeableness
to conscientiousness seem to have more structuring about how i might take data in through a markov blanket
to the other side and the other two seem to have a bit more about what's out there and what's in here
in a very crude way but that's what i'm that's just something that came up for me i thought it was
really interesting cool thank you marco colin blue uh my name is marco marco lin yeah i i uh also want to
build up on that so i fully agree um so so i think i think the pro the um prospects that are most attractive
with this kind of approach to personality is as steven alluded to that that you can uh associate
these aspect factors into a particular apparatus to particular challenges as it were um and uh i think
it's nice also to know to connect that with what was mentioned in the beginning about mars levels of
analysis so um mars levels of analysis is a bit of a hot topic always um so so forget i'm a bit biased
but personally i don't believe that active inference should be seen as as quintessentially
computational because i think it would discredit the fact that it implies a lot about um the
algorithm level so um just like uh steven kind of already said you could have these intermediate
spaces right and that's basically asking you how these computational imperatives or functions are going
to be realized um and i really want to emphasize the notion of mediation because i want to connect that
to what scott was talking about so um it should be emphasized that from what i can tell this model
of personality is kind of neutral about consciousness right it doesn't we should be very very um mindful
about not conflating the first person signs or perceptual models of how empathy arises within us with
the process of empathy as such because if you see the pros of empathy within the brain then there's
two ways to perceive it at the very least third person view from the measures whether physiological
or questionnaires and first person of course um and it stands to reason that that it's not necessary
to have that first person encounter with these processes for these processes to happen but having said
that it would be very interesting to to imagine that consciousness would be like a intermediate space
as well such that the components factors and the respective challenges of the big five um can
actually equilibrate in the sense of the it's not a trivial challenge to balance the respective aspects
of these factors and the factors between each other for the uh autonomous being of concern and so it would
stand to reason that indeed um there might be another intermediate space intermediating between
these five factors which would emphasize the cybernetic function of something like uh consciousness as
a space um which i think it might be interesting for you scott because i think then you can generalize it
for non-living beings or or or composite organizations because if you then associate personality as
heuristics for certain domains of challenges or domains of imperatives and then uh having to
bind them together through a certain integrative space then you could have i think a very interesting
approach organizational science if that makes sense thanks that reminds me a lot of the projective
consciousness model paper that we read in a previous active stream but it's almost like wondering if the
cybernetic organisms or cybernetic systems other than organisms if they have a projective geometry do they
also have that awareness so colin blue scott hi there i'm colin de young i'm a professor in the psychology
department at the university of minnesota what i wanted to say actually ties in nicely to the point
that marco was just making i was going to start by saying that i think it's important that the existence of
personality is not dependent on the existence of quality um so this is a i think a mistake that
people often make when they're considering the big five and similar personality systems they think
oh well these are just about how people perceive themselves or about how people perceive other
people and maybe they're useful categories in terms of like what you need to know about a person
but actually the claim is that you know assuming that these descriptions of people's behavior have validity
they describe patterns of behavior that exist regardless of whether people are accurately aware
of them or not and so you could have differences in you know persistent differences in behavior from
organism to organism in any species that would be directly analogous to what we think of as personality
in human beings now of course it is true that we have this additional layer in which one kind of
characteristic adaptation that we have is that we tell a story about ourselves consciously and we can
describe ourselves and we actually make use of that when we try to measure measure people's
personalities because we you know often just ask them to describe themselves but we're not interested
just in web in their description of themselves as such we're interested in uh we hope and you
know we know from a fair amount of evidence that those descriptions are reasonably accurate so
it's not just that i think that i talk a lot i actually do talk a lot if you can if you take some
kind of objective measurement of that right that's part of what being extroverted is about
um and so you know consciousness is obviously something that well is mysterious in various ways
but i think that you know if we focus on that division between the easy and hard problems of
consciousness i think we actually have some pretty important things to say about the so-called easy
problems of consciousness like how does it function what does it do um and you know i think marco
is right that one of the things that consciousness does is allow people to deal with uh conflicting
information conflicting goals and to to create a sufficiently broad model of the world and our
attention of it that we can then control our attention effectively i really like jeffrey gray's
perspective on consciousness his last book was just called consciousness creeping up on the hard problem
that's really excellent and then uh i also like uh what is his name michael graziano's theory of
consciousness it ties in very nicely to this idea that a cybernetic system uh to be a good cybernetic
system you have to have some kind of physical representation of the variables that are being
controlled that's the good regulator theorem um and so i think that one useful way to think about
consciousness is as a model of our attentional field that allows us to uh direct our attention
effectively to things that are important for our goals or things that are potentially conflicting
between goals and so in that sense yes it would certainly be relevant to conflicts that arise because
of different needs or goals that are related to different personality traits but it's not something
external to the traits mechanistically because the traits are descriptions of patterns of variation that you
know but in a population and so when we ascribe them to the person the person has a level of a trait
and so those traits actually should be reasonably comprehensive descriptors of functioning in all of
the important you know categories of human function and that includes consciousness and in fact if you look at
the contents of the big five openness and intellect is the trait that is really uh related to the qualities
of consciousness people who are high in openness have are conscious of more things their consciousness
is broader it's deeper it's more complex um and you know so there's the openness side of that
trait in the intellect side and so you've got this sort of pattern detection and then pattern analysis
and all of that is basically about uh in large part the qualities of our consciousness
cool very interesting blue then scott then adam
so i am going to totally bypass consciousness because it's just uh it's a hard problem right
but um i do want to just consider for a minute what would happen if we maybe maps like not not
asking what is a person but what is an individual could we then like scale over like non-human systems
like you know organizations or even to other animals like adam brought up like major transitions in
evolution and how do these like personality traits maybe influence evolution that would be interesting
to think about like can we think of maybe clams as like ultra neurotic features and ants as like high
and conscientiousness could we take like these personality traits and map them on to organisms you
know that have evolved over time and and what would that look like in terms of of evolution and what what is
essential you know openness to exploration is obviously key for you know some of the major transitions to
happen that reminds me of the principle components the big fives um they're based upon the patterns
of empirical variation in the actual population as colin brought up and then the animal spirits are
without making a metaphysical claim they're like archetypes like of bravery or of extroversion or
social butterfly or uh you know a couch potato it's still a living creature it's a potato it's in the ground
and so how we model different types of metaphors it's like that's on our procrustean bed but then
what does it look like to have it on their procrustean bed for their personalities or individualities
so scott then um uh marco then colin blue i love the notion of neurotic clams that's my favorite
um yeah this is this is great and just along the same lines a couple of things that leaped into my head i
was thinking of irving goffman stuff where you project yourself out as you want to be perceived
so that's kind of you're modifying your environment in terms of the persona perception
that was one thing and also a lot of self other things in here the identity kind of notion and that
and that idea of presentation of self one of the things i was wondering about is the dsm diagnostic
statistical manual dsm 5 just came out and really how it plays into the um what i guess they would
define as anomalous persona traits um and usually dsm seems to be the ones that aren't the ones that
make you not productive in the capitalist society kind of things because there's a lot of things in
there you call cultural in there but it's interesting that those are the outer bounds of uh what's
expected expectations of persona and i think a lot of the survivalness questions have to do with
expectations and the uh the rising of these variables in the corollaries in animals and in
people have to do with survival and increasingly in social survival but also just that survival of the
organism and so that idea of presentation of self might be even related to camouflage
and issues of that you know how do you present yourself or not present yourself in society
so anyway that just that host of thoughts that how that uh naturally evolved is kind of interesting
also this is and this is not a a studied thing i'm not an expert on this but just functionally again
i think of the um mind and consciousness well i think for consciousness aside just like blue said
but i think of the mind as not in the brain i think of the mind as in language and material culture
and the brain as an antenna tuned into the local mind so if you're my sister adopted a child at the
age of five months and now she's a was raised in central pennsylvania and she was adopted from china
she doesn't speak chinese she speaks spanish and english she's a us person but she looks like a chinese
person so that their mind was developed in and in in the in pennsylvania and so if there's no feral
consciousness which let's take that as an assumption for a second or no feral mind and if it's a learned
phenomenon it's interesting that we have this framing and then we keep re-upping the framing
reaffirming and and valorizing the framing it's interesting to wonder if there's a lag in terms of
survivability what were the persona characteristics that were selected for and i don't just mean in
biological evolution but socially are they identical to the ones that will be selected for in a much
more dense interaction environment for instance so there may be some interesting questions if and
to the extent that persona is not on board in the brain in inherently but is a learned social phenomenon
what is the how malleable is it and i mean i guess that's what education is about and why
colonialists try to get indigenous people in their schools their children in schools early to render
the externality innocuous but it'd be interesting from a perspective of current situations that we
have in current policy challenges and public health challenges etc information challenges how might we
handle those recognizing a more plastic uh persona so just a few thoughts thanks cool okay colin adam marco
okay well i think that there are certainly uh i mean it's certainly true that there are aspects of the
mind and personality that are learned but then uh there are others that are um you know evolved essentially
and uh sufficiently genetically programmed that they would be present even in you know feral children but um
that connection back to the idea of the evolution of personality uh when i when you know blue was talking about
neurotic clams i was thinking about some of the work that's actually been done on the evolution of
personality and animals some of it is very interesting there's a really nice paper from oh i don't know
almost 15 years ago now by daniel nettle that talks about the evolution of personality and humans and other
animals and so one of the things that he talks about are these experiments uh where you take a bunch of fish
and you if you just naturalistically observe them you will see that there are differences in
personalities some of the fish are relatively bold some of them are relatively timid and cautious
and what you can see is that if you systematically manipulate their environment you can actually
change uh evolution of that population over time in interaction with the personalities of the
individual and so the way that i think about this is that personalities drive evolution but evolution also
drives changes in personalities at the population level so what happens is that if you have a if you
have those fish in an environment that has a lot of predators then the bold ones get eaten and the
frequency of the more cautious timid ones increases in the population but if you put them in an environment
that has very few predators then what happens is that the bold ones tend to monopolize a lot more
resources and the frequency of the bold personalities increases in the population yes so always the
ecological selection on the development of personality not even just personality something that can be
reached out and grasped but actually how personality becomes developed in relation so adam then marco then
steven i'll try to tie together a few threads before i lose them um so like earlier i was saying um you
know evolution is one of multiple perspectives but a really special perspective and it is a really special
perspective like i it almost makes me move towards like well on some level i'm uh an instrumentalist um but
with respect to like the things like what is the ontological status of a markov blanket
i think there is also like a realism like a quasi realism and maybe a realism so strong we couldn't
sometimes throw away with the word quasi although we should always kind of keep it in our back pockets
and that we should keep keep in mind that there are multiple ways of carving up the world actually
infinite ways it's just somewhere to be more or less good for being such as us and one really good
carving would be the one that basically relates to functional cycles that achieve closure on time
scales where they can be subject to cumulative evolution broadly construed whether being the
development of the organism or phylogeny and so uh what that might uh pick out some particularly uh
universally agreed upon while still subjective uh joints but to kind of bring it together more
among those
and with relation to your personality characteristics there's an interesting thing that can happen for
species capable of modeling each other with any themselves with a certain kind of richness having
certain types of consciousness in the sense of knowledge where um and even without it potentially uh
that they can become aware of these reliable core screenings of themselves and others and then this
forms a basis for um your planning and then this forms a basis for basically not just the niches that
you're trying to construct but the way your niche is constructing you and so for all this like active
inference with its like embrace an embracing of circular causality and this mutuality between like system and
environment and environment in terms of each being its own kind of active inferential system and exploring this
interplay i think that's really essential for understanding personality both the specific and the general case uh
before i'll let you all move on like one final uh set of threads i would be like when talking about something like
like consciousness so like i recently kind of took on the hard problem uh it was debated how much success i
had but in trying to make way on this um it seems useful to not uh and probably with respect to discussions of
personality um all of our words are just words they're uh core screenings that we agree upon um
and they don't exist in the world and so consciousness part of the issue is like we mean very different things when we use the
word sometimes and so um so similar so you might say um scott was suggesting like you know is um
we might want to distinguish between mind and consciousness or intelligence and consciousness
consciousness and so you could say like your mind is distributed through the world and that your
brain is an antenna i think that's a good perspective um but if you're thinking of like
consciousness as like a type of model where there's something that it's like from the inside to be that
kind of modeling process that might not be extended that might be like a subsystem and a sub model
um and so similar we're kind of building up this onion of complexity with respect to consciousness and
people are kind of kind of engaging at different levels but not always being clear on the level
that they're engaging it and so you could so recently um i was engaging at the level of like
basic phenomenality itself um and uh rudroff and like projective consciousness models very similar
spirit um it's uh you know specifically uh what are the ways we can describe your subjectivity as a
particular reference frame and point of view in the world as you as a cybernetics system how can we
characterize that and so then we go like another level still and we're getting what colin's talking
about with things like attention schemas and like models of your awareness for modeling yourself and
others and shared uh and shared attention schemas and so i guess the um and if you go further still into
things like self-consciousness reflexive self-consciousness and each of these will be kinds of major transitions
in evolution and development which i understand as a kind of evolution and each of these will now dock
with personality in different ways um now i guess the one final thing was um that's interesting uh is
the way in which personality traits if you're thinking of them as kind of core screenings so like if it's like
core screen descriptions and so when can you core screen you can core screen when you have something
like a renormalization process when you have some sort of like emergent attractor structure
um such that the lower level or the smaller fluctuations uh smaller dynamics can be kind of
like averaged out because now you're pointing at this bigger thing and the bigger slower attracting
manifold didn't care about the particulars so or rather that's not relevant for this
coarser phenomena that you're trying to observe and so there's a sense in which um personality is a kind
of course when it's like what are the nature of these like normalization processes and so one of them
it would seem like so what is inducing this attracting structure it seems like a good part of it would be
um so you can model yourself across situations so you know what kind of agent am i that i am likely
to be doing what in what circumstances and this will be pretty essential for pursuing any kind of complex
plan but similarly for coordination um other or working around other agents um or cooperation or
competition what kind of agent is this i'm dealing with but for the sake of cooperation you might you
know ask someone to be uh so like uh responsible they should be able to respond and report in a reliable
and consistent way we actually demand of each other in a way a certain non-erratic character we we demand
dimensionality reduction of each other um just because otherwise we get surprised and as the frangery
principle and active infrastructure says we don't like being surprised um because then we can't plan and
then we can't outsource our cybernetic entropy and it's it's bad so there's a sense in which um
to what degree like there's this the same way that like personality traits are influencing they're
emerging from evolution then influencing the course of evolution with development uh your personality
traits are emerging from your interaction with your environment as you're carving out this
niche um but also they can also become like attracting targets in of themselves on different levels
like if you're uh if you have this expectation of yourself as being this type of agent it could
be a self-fulfilling prophecy i think i'm a neurotic agent i think i'm an extroverted agent now other
people think i'm a neurotic agent other people think i'm an extroverted agent and now they're treating
me a certain way and i'm acting a certain way and this and then this keeps going um yes a lot of thank
you no a lot of no a lot of awesome stuff that reminds me of the scripts it reminds me of the phrase uh the
common saying the absolute power to act absolutely brings responsibility or something like that like
power and responsibility but now we're talking about the power to act and the responsibility
to stimuli and that means that we respond we hope you enjoyed this episode stay tuned for
next time where we will have our final discussion of cybernetic big five and the free energy principle
