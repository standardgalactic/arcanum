this is audible this is the little mermaid written by hans christian anderson narrated by george irving
far out in the ocean the water is as blue as the petals of the loveliest cornflower
and as clear as the purest glass but it is very deep too it goes down deeper than any anchor rope
will go and many many steeples would have to be stacked one on top of another to reach from the
bottom to the surface of the sea it is down there that the sea folk live now don't suppose that there
are only bare white sands at the bottom of the sea no indeed the most marvelous trees and flowers grow
down there with such pliant stalks and leaves that the least stir in the water makes them move about
as though they were alive all sorts of fish large and small dart among the branches just as birds
flit through the trees up here from the deepest spot in the ocean rises the palace of the sea king its
walls are made of coral and its high pointed windows of the clearest amber but the roof is made of muscle
shells that open and shut with the tide this is a wonderful sight to see for every shell holds
glistening pearls any one of which would be the pride of a queen's crown the sea king down there
had been a widower for years and his old mother kept house for him she was a clever woman but very
proud of her noble birth therefore she flaunted twelve oysters on her tail while the other ladies
of the court were only allowed to wear six except for this she was an altogether praiseworthy person
particularly so because she was extremely fond of her granddaughters the little sea princesses
there were six lovely girls but the youngest was the most beautiful of them all her skin was as
soft and tender as a rose petal and her eyes were as blue as the deep sea but like all the others she
had no feet her body ended in a fishtail the whole day long they used to play in the palace down in
the great halls where live flowers grew on the walls whenever the high amber windows were thrown open the
fish would swim in just as swallows dart into our rooms when we opened the windows but these fish
now would swim right up to the little princesses to eat out of their hands and let themselves be petted
outside the palace was a big garden with flaming red and deep blue trees their fruit glittered like
gold and their blossoms flamed like fire on their constantly waving stalks the soil was very fine sand
indeed but as blue as burning brimstone a strange blue veil lay over everything down there you would
have thought yourself aloft in the air with only the blue sky above and beneath you rather than down at
the bottom of the sea when there was a dead calm you could just see the sun like a scarlet flower with
light streaming from its calyx each little princess had her own small garden plot where she could dig and
plant whatever she liked one of them made her little flower bed in the shape of a whale another thought
it neater to shape hers like a little mermaid but the youngest of them made hers as round as the sun
and there she grew only flowers which were as red as the sun itself she was an unusual child quiet and
wistful and when her sisters decorated their gardens with all kinds of odd things they had found in sunken
ships she would allow nothing in hers except flowers as red as the sun and a pretty marble statue
this figure of a handsome boy carved in pure white marble had sunk down to the bottom of the sea from
some ship that was wrecked beside the statue she planted a rose-colored weeping willow tree which
thrived so well that its graceful branches shaded the statue and hung down to the blue sand where their
shadows took on a violent tint and swayed as the branches swayed it looked as if the roots and the
tips of the branches were kissing each other in play nothing gave the youngest princess such pleasure as to
hear about the world of human beings up above them her old grandmother had to tell her all she knew
about the ships and cities and of people and animals what seemed nicest of all to her was that up on
land the flowers were fragrant for those at the bottom of the sea had no scent and she thought it
was nice that the woods were green and that the fish you saw among their branches could sing so loud
and sweet that it was delightful to hear them her grandmother had to call the little birds fish or the
princess would not have known what she was talking about for she had never seen a bird
when you get to be fifteen her grandmother said you will be allowed to rise up out of the ocean and
sit on the rocks in the moonlight to watch the great ships sailing by you will see woods and towns too
next year one of her sisters would be fifteen where the others well since each was a whole year older
than the next the youngest still had five long years to wait until she could rise up from the water
and see what our world was like but each sister promised to tell the others about all that she
saw and what she found most marvelous on her first day their grandmother had not told them half enough
and there were so many things that they longed to know about the most eager of them all was the
youngest the very one who was so quiet and wistful many a night she stood by her open window and looked
up through the dark blue water where the fish waved their fins and tails she could see the moon and stars
to be sure their light was quite dim but looked at through the water they see much bigger than they
appear to us whenever a cloud-like shadow swept across them she knew that it was either a whale
swimming overhead or a ship with many human beings on board little did they dream that a pretty young
mermaid was down below stretching her white arms up toward the keel of their ship the eldest princess
had her fifteenth birthday so now she received permission to rise up out of the water when she got back
she had a hundred things to tell her sisters about but the most marvelous thing of all she said was
to lie on a sandbar in the moonlight when the sea was calm and to gaze at the large city on the shore
where the lights twinkled like hundreds of stars to listen to music to hear the chatter and clamor of
carriages and people to see so many church towers and spires and to hear the ringing bells because she
could not enter the city that was just what she most dearly longed to do oh how intently the youngest
sister listened after this whenever she stood at her open window at night and looked up through the
dark blue waters she thought of that great city with all of its clatter and clamor and even fancied
that in these depths she could hear the church bells ring the next year her second sister had permission
to rise up to the surface and swim wherever she pleased she came up just at sunset and she said
that this spectacle was the most marvelous sight she had ever seen the heavens had a golden glow and as
for the clouds she could not find words to describe their beauty splashed with red and tinted with violet
they sailed over her head but much faster than the sailing clouds were wild swans in a flock
like a long white veil trailing above the sea they flew toward the setting sun
she too swam toward it but down it went and all the rose-colored glow faded from the sea and sky
the following year her third sister ascended and as she was the boldest of them all she swam
up a broad river that flowed into the ocean she saw glorious green vine-colored hills palaces and
manor houses could be glimpsed through the splendid woods she heard all the birds sing and the sun shone
so brightly that often she had to dive under the water to cool her burning face in a small cove she found
a whole school of mortal children paddling about in the water quite naked she wanted to play with
them but they took fright and ran away then along came a little black animal it was a dog but she
had never seen a dog before it barked at her so ferociously that she took fright herself and fled to
the open sea but never could she forget the splendid woods the green hills and the nice children who could
swim in the water although they didn't wear fish tails the fourth sister was not so venturesome
she stayed far out among the rough waves which she said was a marvelous place you could see all around
you for miles and miles and the heavens up above you were like a vast dome of glass she had seen ships
but they were so far away that they looked like seagulls playful dolphins had turned somersaults and
monstrous whales had spouted water through their nostrils so that it looked as if hundreds of
fountains were playing all around them now the fifth sister had her turn her birthday came in
the winter time so she saw things that none of the others had seen the sea was a deep green color and
enormous icebergs drifted about each one glistened like a pearl she said but they were more lofty than
any church steeple built by man they assumed the most fantastic shapes and sparkled like diamonds
she had seated herself on the largest one and all the ships that came sailing by sped away as soon as
the frightened sailors saw her there with her long hair blowing in the wind in the late evening clouds
filled the sky thunder cracked and lightning darted across the heavens black waves lifted those great
bergs of ice on high where they flashed when the lightning struck on all the ships the sails were
reefed and there was fear and trembling but quietly she sat there upon her drifting iceberg and watched the
blue forked lightning strike the sea each of the sisters took delight in the lovely new sights when she
first rose up to the surface of the sea but when they became grown-up girls who were allowed to
go wherever they liked they became indifferent to it they would become homesick and in a month they
said there was no place like the bottom of the sea where they felt so completely at home
on many an evening the older sisters would rise to the surface arm in arm all five in a row
they had beautiful voices more charming than those of any mortal beings when a storm was brewing and
they anticipated a shipwreck they would swim before the ship and sing most seductively of how beautiful
it was at the bottom of the ocean trying to overcome the prejudice that the sailors had against coming
down to them but people could not understand their song and mistook it for the voice of the storm
nor was it for them to see the glories of the deep when their ship went down they were drowned
and it was as dead men that they reached the sea king's palace on the evenings when the mermaids
rose through the water like this arm in arm the youngest sister stayed behind all alone looking
after them and wanting to weep but a mermaid has no tears and therefore she suffers so much more
oh how i wish i were fifteen she said i know i shall love that world up there and all the people who
live in it and at last she too came to be fifteen now i'll have you off my hands said her grandmother
the old queen dowager come let me adorn you like your sisters in the little maid's hair she put a
wreath of white lilies each petal of which was formed from half of a pearl and the old queen let eight big
oysters fasten themselves to the princess's tail as a sign of her high rank but that hurts said the
little mermaid you must put up with a good deal to keep up appearances her grandmother told her
oh how gladly she would have shaken off all these decorations and laid aside the cumbersome wreath
the red flowers in her garden were much more becoming to her but she didn't dare to make any
changes goodbye she said and up she went through the water as a light and as sparkling as a bubble
the sun had just gone down when her head rose above the surface but the clouds still shone like gold and
roses and in the delicately tinted sky sparkled the clear gleam of the evening star the air was mild and
fresh and the sea unruffled a great three master lay in view with only one of all its sails set
for there was not even the whisper of a breeze and the sailors idled about in the rigging and on the
yards there was music and singing on the ship and as night came on they lighted hundreds of such
brightly coloured lanterns that one might have thought the flags of all nations were swinging
in the air the little mermaid swam right up to the window of the main cabin and each time she rose
with a swell she could peep in through the clear glass panes and the crowd of brilliantly dressed
people within the handsomest of them all was a young prince with big dark eyes he could not be more
than 16 years old it was his birthday and that was the reason for all the celebration up on deck the
sailors were dancing and when the prince appeared among them a hundred or more rockets flew through the
air making it as bright as day these startled the little mermaid so badly that she ducked under the
water but she soon peeped up again and then it seemed as if all the stars in the sky were falling
around her never had she seen such fireworks great suns spun around splendid fire fish floated through the
blue air and all these things were mirrored in the crystal clear sea it was so brilliantly bright
that you could see every little rope of the ship and the people could be seen distinctly
oh how handsome the young prince was he laughed and he smiled and he shook people by the hand while
the music rang out in the perfect evening it got very late but the little mermaid could not take her
eyes off the ship and the handsome prince the brightly colored lanterns were put out no more rockets flew
through the air and no more cannon boomed but there was a mutter and rumble deep down in the sea and the
swell kept bouncing her up so high that she could look into the cabin now the ship began to sail
canvas after canvas was spread in the wind the waves rose high great clouds gathered and lightning
flashed in the distance ah they were in for a terrible storm and the mariners made haste to reef the sails
the tall ship pitched and rolled as it sped through the angry sea the waves rose up like towering black
mountains as if they would break over the masthead but the swan-like ship plunged into the valleys between
such waves and emerged to ride their lofty heights to the little mermaid this seemed good sport but to
the sailors it was nothing of the sort the ship creaked and labored thick timbers gave way under the
heavy blows waves broke over the ship the main mast snapped in two like a reed the ship listed over on
its side and water burst into the hold now the little mermaid saw the people were in peril and that
she herself must take care to avoid the beams and wreckage tossed about by the sea one moment it would
be black as pitch and she couldn't see a thing next moment the lightning would flash so brightly that she
could distinguish every soul on board everyone was looking out for himself as best he could she watched
closely for the young prince and when the ship split in two she saw him sink down in the sea at first she
was overjoyed that he would be with her but then she recalled that human people could not live under
the water and he could only visit her father's palace as a dead man no he should not die so she
swam in among all the floating planks and beams completely forgetting that they might crush her she
dived through the waves and rode their crests until at length she reached the young prince who was no
longer able to swim in that raging sea his arms and legs were exhausted his beautiful eyes were
closing and he would have died if the little mermaid had not come to help him she held his head above
water and let the waves take them wherever the waves went at daybreak when the storm was over not a
trace of the ship was in view the sun rose out of the waters red and bright and its beams seemed to
bring the glow of life back to the cheeks of the prince but his eyes remained closed the mermaid
kissed his high and shapely forehead as she stroked his wet hair in place it seemed to her that he
looked like that marble statue in a little garden she kissed him again and hoped that he would live
she saw dry land rise before her in high blue mountains topped with snow as glistening white as if
a flock of swans were resting there down by the shore were splendid green woods and in the foreground stood
a church or perhaps a convent she didn't know which but anyway it was a building orange and lemon trees
grew in its garden and tall palm trees grew beside the gateway here the sea formed a little harbor quite
calm and very deep fine white sand had been washed up below the cliffs she swam there with the handsome
prince and stretched him out on the sand taking special care to pillow his head up high in the warm
sunlight the bells began to ring in the great white building and a number of young girls came out into
the garden the little mermaid swam away behind some tall rocks that stuck out of the water she covered
her hair and her shoulders with foams that no one could see her tiny face and then she watched to see
who would find the poor prince in a little while one of the young girls came upon him she seemed frightened
but only for a minute then she called more people the mermaid watched the prince regain consciousness
and smile at everyone around him but he did not smile at her for he did not even know that she had
saved him she felt very unhappy and when they led him away to the big building she dived sadly down into
the water and returned to her father's palace she had always been quiet and wistful and now she became much
more so her sisters asked her what she had seen on her first visit up to the surface
but she would not tell them a thing many evenings and many mornings she revisited the spot where she
had left the prince she saw the fruit in the garden ripened and harvested and she saw the snow on the
high mountain melted away but she did not see the prince so each time she came home sadder than she had left
it was her one consolation to sit in her little garden and throw her arms about the beautiful marble statue
that looked so much like the prince but she took no care of her flowers now they overgrew the paths
until the place was a wilderness and their long stalks and leaves became so entangled in the branches
of the tree that it cast a gloomy shade finally she couldn't bear it any longer she told her secret
to one of her sisters immediately all the other sisters heard about it no one else knew except a few
more mermaids who told no one except their most intimate friends one of these friends knew who the prince
was she too had seen the birthday celebration on the ship she knew where they came from and where his
kingdom was come little sister said the other princesses arm in arm they rose from the water
in a long row right in front of where they knew the prince's palace stood it was built of pale glistening
golden stone with great marble staircases one of which led down to the sea magnificent gilt domes
rose above the roof and between the pillars all around the building were marble statues that looked most
lifelike through the clear glass of the lofty windows one could see into the splendid halls
with their costly silk hangings and tapestries and walls covered with paintings that were delightful to
behold in the center of the main hall a large fountain played its columns of spray up to the glass domed roof
through which the sun shone down on the water and upon the lovely plants that grew in the big basin
now that she knew where he lived many an evening and many a night she spent there in the sea
she swam much closer to shore than any of her sisters would dare venture and she even went far
up a narrow stream under the splendid marble balcony that cast its long shadow in the water
here she used to sit and watch the young prince where he thought himself quite alone in the bright
moonlight on many evenings she saw him sail out in his fine boat with music playing and flags a flutter
she would peep out through the green rushes and if the wind blew her long silver veil anyone who saw
it mistook it for a swan spreading its wings on many nights she saw the fishermen come out to sea with
their torches and heard them tell about how kind the young prince was this made her proud to think
that it was she who had saved his life when he was buffeted about half dead among the waves and she
thought of how softly his head had rested on her breast and how tenderly she had kissed him though
he knew nothing of all this nor could he even dream of it increasingly she grew to like human beings
and more and more she longed to live among them their world seemed so much wider than her own for they could
skim over the sea in ships and mount up into the lofty peaks high above the clouds and their lands stretched
out in woods and fields farther than the eye could see there was so much she wanted to know her sisters
could not answer all her questions so she asked her grandmother who knew about the upper world which
was what she said was the right name for the countries above the sea if men aren't drowned the
little mermaid asked do they live on forever don't they die as we do down here in the sea
yes the old lady said they too must die and their lifetimes are even shorter than ours we can live to
be three hundred years old but when we perish we turn into mere foam on the sea and haven't even a grave
down here among our dear ones we have no immortal soul no life hereafter we're like the green seaweed once
cut down it never grows again human beings on the contrary have a soul which lives forever long after
their bodies have turned to clay it rises through thin air up to the shining stars just as we rise
through the water to see the lands on earth so men rise up to beautiful places unknown which we shall
never see why weren't we given an immortal soul the little mermaid sadly asked i would gladly give up
my three hundred years if i could be a human being only for a day and later share in that heavenly realm
you must not think about that said the old lady we fare much more happily and are much better off
than the folk up there then i must also die and float as foam upon the sea not hearing the music of
the waves and seeing neither the beautiful flowers nor the red sun can't i do anything at all to win
an immortal soul no her grandmother answered not unless a human being loved you so much that you meant more
to him than his father and mother if his every thought and his whole heart cleaved to you so that he would
let a priest join his right hand to yours and were promised to be faithful here and throughout
all eternity then his soul would dwell in your body and you would share in the happiness of mankind
he would give you a soul and yet keep his own but that can never come to pass the very thing that is
your greatest beauty here in the sea your fishtail would be considered ugly on land they have such poor
taste that to be thought beautiful there you have to have two awkward props which they call legs
the little mermaid sighed and looked unhappily at her fishtail come let us be gay the old lady said
let us leap and bound through the three hundred years that we have to live surely that is time and to
spare and afterwards we should be glad enough to rest in our graves we are holding a court ball this
evening this was a much more glorious affair than is ever to be seen on earth the walls and the ceilings of
the great ballroom were made of massive but transparent glass many hundreds of huge rose
red and grass green shells stood on each side in rows with the blue flames that burned in each shell
illuminating the whole room and shining through the wall so clearly that it was quite bright in the
sea outside you could see the countless fish great and small swimming toward the glass walls on some of
them the scales gleamed purplish red while others were silver and gold across the floor of the hall ran a
wide stream of water and upon this the mermaids and mermen danced to their own entrancing songs
such beautiful voices are not to be heard among the people who live on land
the little mermaid sang more sweetly than anyone else and everyone applauded her for a moment her
heart was happy because she knew she had the loveliest voice of all in the sea or on the land but her
thoughts soon strayed to the world up above she could not forget the charming prince nor her sorrow that
she did not have an immortal soul like his therefore she stole out of her father's palace and while
everything there was song and gladness she sat sadly in her own little garden then she heard a bugle
call through the water and she thought that must mean he is sailing up there he whom i love more than
my father or mother he of whom i am always thinking and in those hands i would so willingly trust my
lifelong happiness i dare to do anything to win him and to gain an immortal soul while my sisters are
dancing here in my father's palace i shall visit the sea witch of whom i have always been so afraid
perhaps she will be able to advise me and help me the little mermaid set out from her garden toward the
whirlpools that raged in front of the witches dwelling she had never gone that way before
no flowers grew there nor any seaweed bare and gray the sands extended to the whirlpools where like roaring
mill wheels the waters whirled and snatched everything within their reach down to the bottom of the sea
between these tumultuous whirlpools she had to thread her way to reach the witches waters and then
for a long stretch the only trail lay through a hot seething mire which the witch called her peatmosh
beyond it her house lay in the middle of a weird forest where all the trees and shrubs were polyps
half animal and half plant they looked like hundred headed snakes growing out of the soil all their
branches were long slimy arms with fingers like wriggling worms they squirmed joint by joint from
their roots to their outermost tentacles and whatever they could lay hold of they twined around and never
let go the little mermaid was terrified and she stopped at the edge of the forest her heart thumped with
fear and she nearly turned back but then she remembered the prince and the souls that men have
and she summoned her courage she bound her long flowing locks closely about her head so that the
polyps could not catch hold of them folded her arms across her breast and darted through the water like
a fish in among the slimy polyps that stretched out their writhing arms and fingers to seize her
she saw that every one of them held something that it had caught with its hundreds of little tentacles
and to which it clung as with strong hoops of steel the white bones of men who had perished at sea
and sunk to these depths could be seen in the polyps arms ships rudders and seamen's chests and the
skeletons of land animals had also fallen into their clutches but the most ghastly sight of all was a
little mermaid whom they had caught and strangled she reached a large muddy clearing in the forest
where big fat water snakes slithered about showing their foul yellowish bellies in the middle of this
clearing was a house built of the bones of shipwrecked men and there sat the sea witch letting a toad eat
out of her mouth just as we might feed sugar to a little canary bird she called the ugly fat water
snakes her little chickabitties and let them crawl and sprawl about on her spongy bosom i know exactly
what you want said the sea witch it is very foolish of you but just the same you shall have your way
for it will bring you to grief my proud princess you want to get rid of your fish tail and have two
props instead so that you can walk about like a human creature and have the young prince fall in
love with you and win him and an immortal soul besides at this the witch gave such a loud crackling
laugh that the toad and the snakes were shaken to the ground where they lay writhing you are just in
time said the witch after the sun comes up tomorrow a whole year would have to go by before i could be of
any help to you i shall compound you a draft and before sunrise you must swim to the shore with it
seat yourself on dry land and drink the draft down then your tail will divide and shrink until it
becomes what the people on earth call a pair of shapely legs but it will hurt it will feel as if
a sharp sword slashed through you everyone who sees you will say that you are the most graceful human
being they have ever laid eyes on for you will keep your gliding movement and no dancer will be able to
tread as lightly as you but every step you take will feel as if you were treading upon knife blades so
sharp that blood must flow i am willing to help you but are you willing to suffer all this yes the
little mermaid said in a trembling voice as she thought of the prince and of gaining a human soul
remember said the witch once you have taken a human form you can never be a mermaid again you can
never come back through the waters to your sisters or to your father's palace and if you do not win the
love of the prince so completely that for your sake he forgets his father and mother cleaves to you with
his every thought in his whole heart and lets the priest join your hands in marriage then you will
win no immortal soul if he marries someone else your heart will break on the very next morning and you
will become foam of the sea i shall take that risk said the little mermaid but she turned as pale as death
also you will have to pay me said the witch and it is no trifling price that i am asking you have the
sweetest voice of anyone down here at the bottom of the sea and while i don't doubt that you would
like to captivate the prince with it you must give this voice to me i will take the very best thing that
you have in return for my sovereign draft i must pour my own blood in it to make the drink as sharp as a
two-edged sword but if you take my voice said the little mermaid what will be left to me your lovely
form the witch told her your gliding movements and your eloquent eyes with these you can easily
enchant a human heart well have you lost your courage stick out your little tongue and i shall
cut it off i'll have my price and you shall have the potent draft go ahead said the little mermaid the
witch hung her cauldron over the flames to brew the draft cleanliness is a good thing she said as she
tied her snakes in a knot and scoured out the pot with them then she pricked herself in the chest and
let her black blood splash into the cauldron steam swirled up from it in such ghastly shapes that anyone
would have been terrified by them the witch constantly threw new ingredients into the cauldron and it
started to boil with a sound like that of a crocodile shedding tears when the draft was ready at last it
looked as clear as the purest water there's your draft said the witch and she cut off the tongue of
the little mermaid who now was dumb and could neither sing nor talk if the polyps should pounce on you when
you walk back through my wood the witch said just spill a drop of this brew upon them and their tentacles
will break in a thousand pieces but there was no need of that for the polyps curled up in terror as
soon as they saw the bright draft it glittered in the little mermaid's hand as if it were a shining
star so she soon traversed the forest the marsh and the place of raging whirlpools she could see her
father's palace the lights had been snuffed out in the great ballroom and doubtless everyone in the
palace was asleep but she dared not go near them now that she was stricken dumb and was leaving her
home forever her heart felt as if it would break with grief she tiptoed into the garden took one
flower from each of her sister's little plots blew a thousand kisses toward the palace and then mounted
up through the dark blue sea the sun had not yet risen when she saw the prince's palace as she climbed
his splendid marble staircase the moon was shining clear the little mermaid swallowed the bitter fiery
draft and it was as if a two-edged sword struck through her frail body she swooned away and lay
there as if she were dead when the sun rose over the sea she awoke and felt a flash of pain but
directly in front of her stood the handsome young prince gazing at her with his coal black eyes
lowering her gaze she saw that her fishtail was gone and that she had the loveliest pair of white legs
any young maid could hope to have but she was naked so she clothed herself in her own long hair
the prince asked who she was and how she came to be there her deep blue eyes looked at him tenderly but
very sadly for she could not speak then he shook her hand and led her into his palace every footstep
felt as if she were walking on the blades and points of sharp knives just as the witch had foretold
but she gladly endured it she moved as lightly as a bubble as she walked beside the prince
he and all who saw her marveled at the grace of her gliding walk once clad in the rich silk and muslin
garments that were provided for her she was the loveliest person in all the palace though she was dumb
and could neither sing nor speak beautiful slaves attired in silk and cloth of gold came to sing
before the prince and his royal parents one of them sang more sweetly than all the others and when the
prince smiled at her and clapped his hands the little mermaid felt very unhappy for she knew that
she herself used to sing much more sweetly oh she thought if he only knew that i parted with my voice
forever so that i could be near him graceful slaves now began to dance to the most wonderful music then the
little mermaid lifted her shapely white arms rose up on the tips of her toes and skimmed over the floor
no one had ever danced so well each movement set off her beauty to better and better advantage and
her eyes spoke more directly to the heart than any of the singing slaves could do
she charmed everyone and especially the prince who called her his dear little foundling
she danced time and again that every time she touched the floor she felt as if she were treading on
sharp edged steel the prince said he would keep her with him always and that she was to have a velvet
pillow to sleep on outside his door he had a pages suit made for her so that she could go with him
on horseback they would rise through the sweet scented woods where the green boughs brushed her
shoulders and where the little birds sang among the fluttering leaves she climbed up high mountains
with the prince and though her tender feet bled so that all could see it she only laughed and followed
him on until they could see the clouds driving far below like a flock of birds in flight to distant lands
at home in the prince's palace while the others slept at night she would go down the broad marble
steps to cool her burning feet in the cold sea water and then she would recall those who lived
beneath the sea one night her sisters came by arm in arm singing sadly as they breasted the waves
when she held out her hands towards them they knew who she was and told her how unhappy she had made
them all they came to see her every night after that and once far far out to sea she saw her old
grandmother who had not been up to the surface this many a year with her was the sea king with his
crown upon his head they stretched out their hands to her but they did not venture so near the land
as her sisters had day after day she became more dear to the prince who loved her as one loved a good
little child but he never thought of making her his queen yet she had to be his wife or she would
never have an immortal soul and on the morning after his wedding she would turn into foam on the waves
don't you love me best of all the little mermaid's eyes seemed to question him when he took her in
his arms and kissed her lovely forehead yes you are most dear to me said the prince for you have
the kindest heart you love me more than anyone else does and you look so much like a young girl
i once saw but never shall find again i was on a ship that was wrecked and the waves cast me ashore
near a holy temple where many young girls performed their rituals the youngest of them found me beside
the sea and saved my life though i saw her no more than twice she's the only person in all the world
whom i could love but you are so much like her that you almost replace the memory of her in my heart
she belongs to that holy temple therefore it is my good fortune that i have you
we shall never part alas he does not know it was i who saved his life the little mermaid thought
i carried them over the sea to the garden where the temple stands i hid him behind the foam and
watched to see if anyone would come i saw the pretty maid he loves better than me a sigh was the only
sign of a deep distress for a mermaid cannot cry he says that the other maid belongs to the holy temple
she will never come out into the world so they will never see each other again it is i who will care for him
love him and give my life to him now rumours arose that the prince was to wed the beautiful daughter of a neighbouring king
and it was for this reason that he was having such a superb ship made ready to sail
the rumour ran that the prince's real interest in visiting the neighbouring kingdom was to see the king's daughter and that he was to travel with a lordly retinue
the little mermaid shook her head and smiled for she knew the prince's thoughts far better than anyone else did
i am forced to make this journey he told her i must visit the beautiful princess for this is my
parents wish they would not have me bring her home as my bride against my own will and i can never love
her she does not resemble the lovely maiden in the temple as you do and if i were to choose a bride i
would sooner choose you my dear mute foundling with those telling eyes of yours and he kissed her on the
mouth fingered her long hair and laid his head against her heart so that she came to dream of mortal
happiness and an immortal soul i trust you aren't afraid of the sea my silent child he said as they
went on board the magnificent vessel that was to carry them to the land of the neighbouring king
and he told her stories of storms of ships becalmed of strange deep sea fish and of the wonders that
divers had seen she smiled at such stories for no one knew about the bottom of the sea as well as she did
in the clear moonlight when everyone except the man at the helm was asleep she sat on the side of the
ship gazing down through the transparent water and fancied she could catch glimpses of her father's
palace on the topmost tower stood her old grandmother wearing her silver crown and looking
up at the keel of the ship through the rushing waves then her sisters rose to the surface looked at her
sadly and wrung their white hands she smiled and waved trying to let them know that all went well
and that she was happy but along came the cabin boy and her sisters dived out of sight so quickly
that the boy supposed the flash of white he had seen was merely foam on the sea next morning the
ship came into the harbor of the neighboring king's glorious city all the church bells chimed and
trumpets were sounded from all the high towers while the soldiers lined up with flying banners and
glittering bayonets every day had a new festivity as one ball or levee followed another but the princess
was still to appear they said she was being brought up in some far away sacred temple where she was learning
every royal virtue but she came at last the little mermaid was curious to see how beautiful this
princess was and she had to grant that a more exquisite figure she had never seen the princess's
skin was clear and fair and behind the long dark lashes her deep blue eyes were smiling and devoted
it was you the prince cried you are the one who saved me when i lay like a dead man beside the sea
he clasped the blushing bride of his choice in his arms i am happier than a man should be he told
his little mermaid my fondest dream that which i never dared to hope has come true you will share
in my great joy for you love me more than anyone does the little mermaid kissed his hand and felt
that her heart was beginning to break for the morning after his wedding day would see her dead
and turned to watery foam all the church bells rang out and heralds rode through the streets to announce
the wedding upon every altar sweet-scented oils were burned in costly silver lamps the priests swung
their senses the bride and the bridegroom joined their hands and the bishop blessed their marriage
the little mermaid clothed in silk and cloth of gold held the bride's train but she was deaf to the
wedding march and blind to the holy ritual the thought turned on her last night upon earth and on all she
had lost in this world that same evening the bride and bridegroom went aboard the ship cannon thundered
and banners waved on the deck of the ship a royal pavilion of purple and gold was set up and furnished
with luxurious cushions here the wedding couple were to sleep on that calm clear night the sails
swelled in the breeze and the ship glided so lightly that it scarcely seemed to move over the quiet sea
all nightfall brightly colored lanterns were lighted and the mariners merrily danced on the deck
the little mermaid could not forget that first time she rose from the depths of the sea and looked
on at such pomp and happiness light as a swallow pursued by his enemies she joined in the whirling
dance everyone cheered her for never had she danced so wonderfully her tender feet felt as if they were
pierced by daggers but she did not feel it her heart suffered far greater pain she knew that this was the
last evening that she ever would see him for whom she had forsaken her home and family for whom she had
sacrificed her lovely voice and suffered such constant torment while he knew nothing of all
these things it was the last night that she would breathe the same air with him or look upon deep
waters or the star fields of the blue sky a never-ending night without thought and without
dreams awaited her who had no soul and could not get one the merry-making lasted long after midnight yet
she laughed and danced on despite the thought of death she carried in her heart
the prince kissed his beautiful bride and she toyed with his coal black hair hand in hand they went to
rest in the magnificent pavilion a hush came over the ship only the helmsman remained on deck as the
little mermaid leaned her white arms on the bullocks and looked to the east to see the first red hint of
daybreak for she knew that the first flash of the sun would strike her dead then she saw her sisters rise
up among the waves they were as pale as she and there was no sign of their lovely long hair that the
breezes used to blow it had all been cut off we have given our hair to the witch they said so that
she would send you help and save you from death tonight she gave us a knife here it is see the sharp
blade before the sun rises you must strike it into the prince's heart and when his warm blood bathes
your feet they will grow together and become a fishtail then you will be a mermaid again able
to come back to us in the sea and live out your three hundred years before you die and turn into
dead salt sea foam make haste he or you must die before sunrise our old grandmother is so grief-stricken
that her white hair is falling fast just as ours did under the witch's scissors kill the prince
and come back to us hurry hurry see that red glow in the heavens in a few minutes the sun will rise and
you must die so saying they gave a strange deep sigh and sank beneath the waves the little mermaid
parted the purple curtains of the tent and saw the beautiful bride asleep with her head on the prince's
breast the mermaid bent down and kissed his shapely forehead she looked at the sky fast reddening for
the break of day she looked at the sharp knife and again turned her eyes towards the prince who in his
sleep murmured the name of his bride his thoughts were all for her and the knife blade trembled in the
mermaid's hand but then she flung it from her far out over the waves where it fell the waves were red
as if bubbles of blood seethed in the water with eyes already glazing she looked once more at the
prince hurled herself over the bullocks into the sea and felt her body dissolve in a foam
the sun rose up from the waters its beams fell warm and kindly upon the chill sea foam and the little
mermaid did not feel the hand of death in the bright sunlight overhead she saw hundreds of fair ethereal
beings they were so transparent that through them she could see the ship's white sails and the red
clouds in the sky their voices were sheer music but so spirit-like that no human ear could detect the
sound just as no eye on earth could see their forms without wings they floated as light as the air itself
the little mermaid discovered that she was shaped like them and that she was gradually rising up out of
the foam who are you towards whom i rise she asked and her voice sounded like those above her so spiritual
that no music on earth could match it we are the daughters of the air they answered a mermaid has no
immortal soul and can never get one unless she wins the love of a human being her eternal life must depend upon
a power outside herself the daughters of the air do not have an immortal soul either but they can earn
one by their good deeds we fly to the south where the hot poisonous air kills human beings unless we
bring cool breezes we carry the scent of flowers through the air bringing freshness and healing balm
wherever we go when for three hundred years we have tried to do all the good that we can we are given an
immortal soul and a share in mankind's eternal bliss you poor little mermaid have tried with your whole
heart to do this too your suffering and your loyalty have raised you up into the realm of airy spirits
and now in the course of three hundred years you may earn by your good deeds a soul that will never
die the little mermaid lifted her clear bright eyes towards god's sun and for the first time her eyes
were wet with tears on board the ship all was astir and lively again she saw the prince and his fair
bride in search of her then they gazed sadly into the seething foam as if they knew she had hurled herself
into the waves unseen by them she kissed the bride's forehead smiled upon the prince and rose up with
the other daughters of the air to the rose red clouds that sailed on high this is the way that
we shall rise to the kingdom of god after three hundred years have passed we may even get there
sooner one spirit whispered unseen we fly into the homes of men where there are children and for every
day on which we find a good child who pleases his parents and deserves their love god shortens our days
of trial but the child does not know when we float through his room but when we smile at him in
approval one year is taken from our three hundred but if we see a naughty mischievous child we must shed
tears of sorrow and each tear adds a day to the time of our trial this was the little mermaid written by
