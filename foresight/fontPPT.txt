Challenges with Devanagari
Robust OCR systems already in place for Roman Scripts
Lack of such software for Hindi Languages because of highly
complicated structure and composition

Challenges with Devanagari
Robust OCR systems already in place for Roman Scripts
Lack of such software for Hindi Languages because of highly
complicated structure and composition
An eg. of such composition is a form of character conjunction
referred to as “Jutakshar”

Our Work
Words containing Jutakshar are quite popular and can be found in

Most OCR systems do not take care to handle such characters, which
in turn reduces their precision

Most OCR systems do not take care to handle such characters, which
in turn reduces their precision
Low accuracy due to Jutakshars being recognized as a single character

Our Work
Words containing Jutakshar are quite popular and can be found in
many document
Most OCR systems do not take care to handle such characters, which
in turn reduces their precision
Low accuracy due to Jutakshars being recognized as a single character
We have tried to build upon existing frameworks to better handle
these special strings

Jutakshar Identiﬁcation
Using the previous model, the character boxes predicted as containing
jutakshars, are now split into the corresponding half and full character

jutakshars, are now split into the corresponding half and full character
Used vertical histograms for splitting but restricted our search in the
middle part of the character

The position of the minima was used to split the the Jutakshar into
the half and the full character forming it
