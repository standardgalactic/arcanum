A considerable amount of the standard model’s three-generation structure can be realised from
just the 8C-dimensional algebra of the complex octonions. Indeed, it is a little-known fact that
the complex octonions can generate on their own a 64C-dimensional space. Here we identify an
su(3) ⊕u(1) action which splits this 64C-dimensional space into complexiﬁed generators of SU(3),
together with 48 states. These 48 states exhibit the behaviour of exactly three generations of quarks
and leptons under the standard model’s two unbroken gauge symmetries. This article builds on a
previous one, [1], by incorporating electric charge.
Finally, we close this discussion by outlining a proposal for how the standard model’s full set of
states might be identiﬁed within the left action maps of R ⊗C ⊗H ⊗O (the Cliﬀord algebra Cl(8)).
Our aim is to include not only the standard model’s three generations of quarks and leptons, but
also its gauge bosons.
I.
WHY THREE GENERATIONS?
Upon the 2012 discovery of a 125 GeV Higgs, the most
straightforward four-generation chiral extension to the
standard model was ruled out, [2]-[5].
Of course, the
possibility of eventually ﬁnding a fourth generation is
not excluded for every imaginable scenario, e.g. [6], [7].
However, given this new data, it seems increasingly likely
that nature’s game of replicating particle content comes
to an end at three generations.
Although three-generation models can be relatively
easy to justify experimentally, they are substantially
more diﬃcult to motivate theoretically.
That is, few
mathematical objects exhibit (eﬃciently) the group rep-
resentations necessary to describe three full generations.
Indeed, it is no secret that the most well-known ex-
tensions of the standard model: SU(5), Spin(10) grand
uniﬁed theories, and the Pati-Salam model are all natu-
rally one-generation models. For the standard model and
its most well-studied extensions, the existence of three
families need be imposed by hand.
With this being said, a variety of proposals have ma-
terialized over the years, e.g.
[8]-[21], in order to ex-
plain the curious pattern. This includes in particular a
recent three-generation proposal put forward by Dubois-
Violette and Todorov, based on the 27-dimensional (oc-
tonionic) exceptional Jordan algebra.
The intention of our article here is not to present a
completed three-generation quantum ﬁeld theory.
In-
stead we will demonstrate a signiﬁcant portion of an al-
gebraic framework on which such a theory might be built.
Rather unconventionally, this framework does not be-
gin with a larger mathematical object, which is then sub-
sequently broken down into the known quark and lepton
representations of the standard model. On the contrary,
we will make use of just an 8C-dimensional algebra - an
algebra whose degrees of freedom are far outweighed by
the number of states which we aim to describe.
We will begin by introducing the algebra of the com-
plex octonions, C ⊗O.
This 8C-dimensional algebra
will then be seen to generate the complex Cliﬀord al-
gebra Cl(6), via its left-action maps. Within this 64C-
dimensional Cliﬀord algebra, we next identify a pair of
complexiﬁed su(3)c Lie algebras. These SU(3)c genera-
tors will then be applied to the rest of the Cliﬀord al-
gebra, which consequently breaks down into exactly the
SU(3)c representations one would expect for three full
generations of quarks and leptons, [1].
Subsequently, we demonstrate how the action of these
generators may be generalized so as to include a new
u(1). This U(1) action then distributes 48 eigenvalues
which are found to coincide with electric charge.
Hence, it is shown that a single eight-dimensional al-
gebra can encode the behaviour of three full generations
under nature’s two unbroken gauge symmetries.
This article builds on [1] by (1) demonstrating that the
generators of G2 may be described in terms of associa-
tors, (2) by redeﬁning the operation of Lie algebras on
Cl(6) in terms of a single action, (3) by further specifying
the projection properties of quark and lepton states, and
ﬁnally (4) by incorporating electric charge.
Over the years, there has been quite a number of au-
thors who have used Cl(6) to describe one generation of
standard model fermions. These include, but are likely

2
not limited to [22]-[30].
A natural question which arises in this article is
whether or not the demonstrated SU(3)c × U(1)em ad-
joint representations might somehow be identiﬁed as
gauge bosons. In this case, one might then hope to even-
tually describe the standard model’s full set of states in-
side of one single mathematical object. In the addendum
of this paper, we outline a proposal for how such a task
might be carried out. Readers wishing to skip straight
to this addendum should feel free to do so.

INTRODUCTION TO C ⊗O
The complex octonions form an 8-dimensional alge-
bra over C, spanned by basis vectors ej for j = 0, . . . 7.
The basis vector e0 plays the role of the multiplicative
identity, whereas the ek for k = 1, . . . 7 are imaginary
units with e2
k = −1. The remaining octonionic multipli-
cation rules may be described succinctly by specifying
e1e2 = e4, and then invoking the rules, [31],
eiej = −ejei
i ̸= j,
eiej = ek
⇒
ei+1ej+1 = ek+1,
eiej = ek
⇒
e2ie2j = e2k.
(1)
Please see Figure 1.
FIG. 1. Octonionic multiplication rules, [32].
The octonions are perhaps best known for their prop-
erty of non-associativity, meaning that there exists an a,
b, and c in the algebra such that a(bc) ̸= (ab)c. Hence,
brackets should typically be speciﬁed whenever multipli-
cation involves three or more elements. With this being
said, readers should realise that non-associativity is by
no means a foreign concept in physics. It is an under-
appreciated fact that both Lie algebras and Jordan alge-
bras likewise constitute non-associative algebras. (As an
example, consider the elements a = iσx, b = iσx, c = iσy
in the su(2) Lie algebra, where multiplication is given by
the commutator.)
Symmetries of the algebra: the derivations of C ⊗O
are given by the complexiﬁed 14-dimensional exceptional
Lie algebra g2. These g2 elements can be seen to act on
a generic element f ∈C ⊗O as
Λ1f = i
2{e1, e5, f} −i
2{e3, e4, f}
Λ2f = i

over C. Here, we have made use of the associator, deﬁned
as {a, b, c} ≡a(bc) −(ab)c. Readers should note that,
when taken over the ﬁeld of the real numbers, the ﬁrst
eight Λj generate SU(3). In this case, we have chosen
this SU(3) so that it holds the octonionic imaginary unit
e7 constant.
III.
FROM 8 DIMENSIONS TO 64
Given the deﬁnition of the associator, it is straightfor-
ward to see that the 14 generators of equations (2) are
constructed from chains of octonions acting from the left
on f. In fact, the most general left-action map, M, may
be described as
Mf ≡c0f + P6
i=1 cieif + P6
j=2
Pj−1
i=1 cij ei(ejf)
+ P6
k=3
Pk−1
j=2
Pj−1
i=1 cijk ei(ej(ekf)) + . . .
+c123456e1(e2(e3(e4(e5(e6f))))),
(3)
where the coeﬃcients c0, ci, · · · ∈C. Readers may have
noticed that the imaginary unit e7 is not explicitly ex-

3
pressed in these maps. This is due to the fact that
e7f = e1(e2(e3(e4(e5(e6f)))))
∀f ∈C ⊗O,
(4)
thereby making e7 redundant as a left-action map. Of
course, e7 itself holds no preferred status within the octo-
nions, and the space of left-action maps may equivalently
be generated by any six of the seven imaginary units.
The
octonionic
chains
(3)
describe
all
possible
complex-linear maps from C ⊗O to itself.
That is,
they faithfully represent the full 64C-dimensional space
of complex endomorphisms of C ⊗O. Indeed, even right
multiplication may be re-expressed in the form of equa-
tion (3). For example,
fe7 = 1
2 (e1(e3f) + e2(e6f) + e4(e5f) −e7f)
(5)
∀f ∈C ⊗O.
So in summary, we have shown how it is possible to
build up a 64C-dimensional space, using only the 8C-
dimensional C ⊗O operating on itself from the left. For
examples of earlier work which make reference to this
64-dimensional algebra, see [22], [33], [10].
IV.
THE CLIFFORD ALGEBRA Cl(6)
It is reasonably straightforward to show that
ei(ejf) =



−ej(eif)
when i ̸= j
−f
when i = j
(6)
∀f ∈C ⊗O, and for i, j = 1, . . . 6. (This should be recog-
nizable to the reader as Cliﬀord algebraic structure.) In
fact, the linear maps (3) give a faithful representation of
the complex Cliﬀord algebra Cl(6).
Readers concerned about the potential conﬂict be-
tween the inherent associativity of a Cliﬀord algebra, and
the non-associativity of the octonions should note that
multiplication of left-action maps is given by the compo-
sition of maps. Of course, the composition of maps is
associative, by deﬁnition; F ◦(G ◦H) = (F ◦G) ◦H.
Consider now for a moment complex Cliﬀord algebras
of the form Cl(2n) for n ∈Z > 0.
It is known that
the generating space of such algebras may be partitioned
into an n-dimensional subspace spanned by raising op-
erators {α†
i} and an n-dimensional subspace spanned by
lowering operators {αi}. These n-dimensional subspaces
are known as maximal totally isotropic subspaces, whose
basis vectors obey
{αi, αj} = 0 = {α†
i, α†
j},
{αi, α†
j} = δij
(7)
for i, j = 1, . . . n, under the anticommutator: {a, b} ≡
ab + ba. For further details, please see [34].
In the case of our octonionic representation of Cl(6),
(3), the generating space is spanned by the linear maps
ei for i = 1, . . . 6. These may be reorganized into a set of
lowering operators
α1 ≡−e5 + ie4
2
,
α2 ≡−e3 + ie1
2
,
α3 ≡−e6 + ie2
2
,
(8)
and a set of raising operators,
α†
1 ≡e5 + ie4
2
,
α†
2 ≡e3 + ie1
2
,
α†
3 ≡e6 + ie2
2
,
(9)
where † maps the complex i 7→−i and the octonionic
ej 7→−ej, while reversing the order of multiplication,
(ab)† = b†a†.
Readers may conﬁrm that these ladder
operators obey equations (7), as maps acting on any f ∈
C ⊗O.
The structure of these ladder operators is preserved by
the unitary group U(3) = SU(3) × U(1)/Z3, as depicted
in Figure (2). This U(3) symmetry may be realised as
FIG. 2. Octonionic imaginary units e1, e2, . . . e6 generate the
Cliﬀord algebra Cl(6). These six generators may be rewritten
in terms of a basis of ladder operators, α1, α2, α3, α†
1, α†
2, α†
3,
which have U(3) = SU(3) × U(1)/Z3 symmetry.
GαiG−1 and Gα†
i G−1, for G ≡exp (irjΛj + ir0Q) ∈
Cl(6).
Here, rk ∈R for k = 0, . . . 8, and the SU(3)
generators, Λj, are deﬁned as in equations (2). The U(1)
generator is deﬁned as
Qf ≡N
3 f = 1
3
3
X
i=1
α†
i (αif) ,
(10)
acting on any f ∈C ⊗O. This Q is proportional to the
number operator, N, for the system, and can be seen
to commute with the Λj.
In [26], Q was identiﬁed as
the generator of electric charge, in the context of a one-
generation model.
Before moving on, we will ﬁrst simplify our notation.
From here forward, it will now be implicitly assumed

4
that equations in Cl(6) hold ∀f ∈C ⊗O. That is, we
will no longer write f explicitly. Furthermore, we will
cease to write the nested brackets of octonionic left-action
maps, (3). That is, right-to-left bracketing will also be
implicitly assumed.
Hence, equations such as Qf ≡
1
3
P3
i=1 α†
i (αif) will now simply read Q ≡1
3
P3
i=1 α†
iαi.
V.
THREE GENERATIONS UNDER SU(3)c
For our ﬁrst result, we will now show how the SU(3)c
irreducible representations corresponding to three gener-
ations of quarks and leptons may be found, using only
the action of C ⊗O on itself.
We begin by splitting Cl(6) into two 32C-dimensional
pieces: Cl(6)s and Cl(6)s∗, where s is given by the linear
map s ≡1
2 (1 + ie7) ∈Cl(6). Readers may conﬁrm that
both s and s∗are idempotents, and that ss∗= s∗s = 0.
Within the subalgebra Cl(6)s, we ﬁnd a faithful rep-
resentation of the Lie algebra su(3), generated by eight
objects of the form Λjs. Seeing as how [Λj, s] = 0, it
may be conﬁrmed that
 Λi
2 s, Λj
2 s

= icijk
Λk
2 s
(11)
holds, where cijk are the usual SU(3) structure constants.
Now, given this representation of the SU(3) Lie alge-
bra, we may subsequenty apply the Λjs generators to the
remainder of Cl(6)s. Under the action [iΛjs, Cl(6)s], the
32C-dimensional Cl(6)s is found to break down as
Cl(6)s
7→
8 ⊕3 ⊕(5 × 3∗) ⊕(6 × 1)
(12)
over C. For a sample calculation, please see [1]. Invok-
ing the complex conjugate, i 7→−i, sends particles to
antiparticles, and vice versa. In other words, the com-
mutator [−iΛ∗
js∗, Cl(6)s∗] induces
Cl(6)s∗
7→
8 ⊕3∗⊕(5 × 3) ⊕(6 × 1) .
(13)
Finally, these actions may be trivially combined into
one single action on the full 64C-dimensional Cl(6). Un-
der [iΛjs, Cl(6)s]+[−iΛ∗
js∗, Cl(6)s∗], the algebra Cl(6)
breaks down into a pair of complexiﬁed SU(3) Lie alge-
bras, together with the SU(3) representations
(6 × 3) ⊕(6 × 3∗) ⊕(6 × 1) ⊕(6 × 1) .
(14)
Readers should recognize these as the SU(3)c represen-
tations necessary to describe three full generations of
quarks and leptons.
VI.
THREE GENERATIONS UNDER
SU(3)c × U(1)em/Z3
Now, given the ladder operator symmetry U(3) =
SU(3)c × U(1)em/Z3 described earlier, it is natural to
wonder if these SU(3)c results may be extended so as to
include U(1)em. The most obvious electromagnetic ex-
tension to the action [iΛjs, Cl(6)s] + [−iΛ∗
js∗, Cl(6)s∗]
is clearly [iQs, Cl(6)s]+[−iQ∗s∗, Cl(6)s∗]. However, we
ﬁnd that this action fails to assign the correct electric
charges.
Hence, we are then left to ask: Could there be a way
to generalize this action so that Q produces the electric
charges of standard model fermions?
In what is to follow, we will need to introduce an idem-
potent, S, which is the right-multiplication analogue of
s.
Sf ≡f 1
2(1 + ie7)
= 1
2f −i
4e7f + i
4e1(e3f) + i
4e2(e6f) + i
4e4(e5f)
(15)
acting on f ∈C ⊗O, or more simply,
S ≡1
2 + 1
4 (−ie7 + ie13 + ie26 + ie45) ,
(16)
where eabf is shorthand for ea(ebf). Readers will ﬁnd
that equation (15) is easily conﬁrmed given equation (5).
As before, SS∗= S∗S = 0, and furthermore, [s, S ] =
[s, S∗] = 0.
Given that S +S∗= 1, it is straightforward to see that
the action [iΛjs, Cl(6)s] + [−iΛ∗
js∗, Cl(6)s∗] is equal to
[ iΛjs, S Cl(6)s ] +

−iΛ∗
js∗, S∗Cl(6)s∗
+ [ iΛjs, S∗Cl(6)s ] +

−iΛ∗
js∗, S Cl(6)s∗
.
(17)
Furthermore, from equations (2), it is clear that Λ∗
j =
−Λj, and hence the action (17) is identical to

−iΛ∗
js, S Cl(6)s

+ [ iΛjs∗, S∗Cl(6)s∗]
+ [ iΛjs, S∗Cl(6)s ] +

−iΛ∗
js∗, S Cl(6)s∗
.
(18)
However, this new action is not the same as the old ac-
tion when we extend these generators so as to include Q.
Unlike with the Λj operators, Q∗̸= −Q.
Upon ﬁnally including Q,

−i(rjΛ∗
j + r0Q∗)s, S Cl(6)s

+ [ i(rjΛj + r0Q)s∗, S∗Cl(6)s∗]
+ [ i(rjΛj + r0Q)s, S∗Cl(6)s ]
+

−i(rjΛ∗
j + r0Q∗)s∗, S Cl(6)s∗
,
(19)
we ﬁnd that Cl(6) now breaks down as
Cl(6) 7→
8 0 ⊕(3 × 3 2
3 ) ⊕(3 × 3−1
3 ) ⊕(3 × 1 0) ⊕(3 × 1−1) ⊕
8 0 ⊕(3 × 3∗
−2
3 ) ⊕(3 × 3∗
1
3 ) ⊕(3 × 1 0) ⊕(3 × 1 1).
(20)
To be more explicit, the SU(3)c × U(1)em/Z3 repre-
sentations corresponding to three generations of particles

may be described by complex linear combinations of the
states

(21)
From here, ﬁnding anti-particle states is remarkably easy.
As with previous work, [32], [1], [26], [27], one simply
invokes the complex conjugate, i 7→−i.
Readers should note that we are not distinguishing be-
tween the generations at this point. Hence, for example,
the three 3 2
3 representations are labeled arbitrarily as
u1, u2, u3, instead of u, c, t.
Finally, we mention that the electric charge assign-
ments of equations (21) can easily be conﬁrmed by the
reader.
This is facilitated by the fact that Q may be
decomposed as
Q = 1
3 s∗S + 2
3 sS∗+ s∗S∗.
(22)
For example, Q may be applied to the state uR
1 by setting
rj = 0 and r0 = 1 in the action (19):

iQs, S∗uR
1 s

= i
 2
3 sS∗, sS∗uR
1 sS

= i 2
3 uR
1 .
(23)
Hence, the action (19) assigns to uR
1 a Q charge of 2
3.

SUMMARY
This article demonstrates how the SU(3)c×U(1)em/Z3
representations for three full generations of quarks and
leptons may be generated, using just an 8C-dimensional
algebra. In order to arrive at these 48 states, we did not
simply replicate copies of C ⊗O. Instead, we considered
the action of this one algebra on itself.
For those more accustomed to grand uniﬁed theories,
this method should indeed seem unfamiliar. That is, it
runs backwards to the usual direction of the prototypi-
cal uniﬁed theory. Standard grand uniﬁed theories be-
gin with a sizeable Lie group, and then implement an
appropriate mechanism in order to scale the symmetry
group down. In contrast, this article shows how a low-
dimensional algebra may act autonomously in order to
scale the degrees of freedom up.
Although we have not proposed a grand uniﬁed theory
here, these results do seem to point towards uniﬁcation
of another form. It is clear that the SU(3)c ×U(1)em/Z3
group elements, and also these 48 states, owe their exis-
tence to the same algebra. Ideally, all objects in such a
model should likewise arise from the same algebra.

OUTLOOK
While C ⊗O did supply a reasonable portion of the
standard model’s group representation structure, we have
by no means achieved a full description. For instance,
nowhere in this paper have we discussed spin or chiral-
ity. And so we ask, in what ways may these results be
extended?
In the third chapter of [27], it was shown that each of
the Lorentz representations of the standard model can
be identiﬁed as invariant subspaces of the algebra of the
complex quaternions, C⊗H. To be more precise, this 4C-
dimensional algebra yields: Lorentz scalars, φ, left- and
right-handed Weyl spinors, ΨL, ΨR, Majorana spinors,
ΨM, Dirac spinors, ΨD, four-vectors, pµ, and the ﬁeld
strength tensor, Fµν, [35]. These Lorentz (or SL(2, C))
representations were identiﬁed as invariant subspaces of
C ⊗H under various actions of the algebra on itself. In

6
each case, they were found to arise as a result of the outer
automorphism and anti-automorphisms of the algebra,
[27].
It is straightforward to see that C⊗H and C⊗O may be
combined, via a tensor product over C, into the algebra
(C ⊗H) ⊗C (C ⊗O) = C ⊗H ⊗O = R ⊗C ⊗H ⊗O. The
Dixon algebra R⊗C⊗H⊗O is the tensor product of the
only four normed division algebras over the real numbers.
(For an alternate three-generation model which makes
use of tensor products of column vectors over division
algebras, see [10].)
Once spin and chirality are incorporated into this
model, we might then be in a position to address some
obvious outstanding questions. For example,
· How is electroweak symmetry to be described in this
model? How might it incorporate Q?
· How do we interpret the 8 0 representations in Cl(6)?
· What brings about the form of the action (19)?
· What
is
the
connection
between
the
recent
one-
generation results of [29] and this model? Or should [29]
prompt the reconsideration of a 4-generation model?
· If the standard model’s group representation structure
is indeed a result of the algebras R, C, H, and O, then
what is it exactly that is so special about these algebras?

ADDENDUM:
TOWARDS A COMPLETE DESCRIPTION
In recent months there has been quite a number of
papers written, which link R, C, H, and O to elemen-
tary particle physics.
Notably, Gording and Schmidt-
May [36] have carefully demonstrated that the full set of
standard model bosons and fermions can be neatly ac-
counted for within C ⊗←−
O, supplemented by the complex
quaternions. Dubois-Violette and Todorov continue the
pursuit of linking the exceptional Jordan algebra to the
standard model [37]; a broad series of exploratory papers
has been written by Castro-Perelman, [38]-[40], including
a new four-generation model. Gresnigt and Gillard have
proposed a description of three generations of fermions
in terms of Cl(8) with possible links to triality, [41]. Also
closely related is a carefully crafted article by Zatloukal,
which advocates for a Cliﬀord algebraic description of
non-abelian gauge theories, [41].
Given this recent activity, we would like to contribute
a brief proposal, which outlines some new ideas for fur-
ther investigation. This preliminary proposal is aimed at
uncovering a novel algebraic description of the standard
model’s full set of states. It extends ideas from the open
questions section of [1].
In short, we oﬀer the idea that the standard model’s
states might arise as the result of a multi-action. A multi-
action is a new kind of generalized multiplication rule,
which single-handedly splits a Cliﬀord algebra into Lie
algebras, Jordan algebras, and spinor spaces.
Suppose we were to consider the Cliﬀord algebra Cl(8),
generated now by left multiplicative chains of R ⊗C ⊗
H⊗O. Gording and Schmidt-May recently demonstrated
in detail, for the ﬁrst time, that this R ⊗C ⊗←−
H ⊗←−
O
with its 256 C dimensions has the capacity to house these
particle representations. This would include not only the
standard model’s three generations of fermions, but also
its bosons. Unlike with the work presented earlier in this
paper, these states could now ﬁnally include spin and
polarization.
A.
Set up
In seeking out a ﬁnal uniﬁed algebraic description, we
might hope for a couple of features to materialize.
(1) We might expect that the theory’s chirality be an
artifact of some natural algebraic structure, and will aim
to avoid the use of an ad hoc projection operator for the
task.
(2) We might similarly hope that those states describ-
ing the three diﬀerent fermion generations will be found
to be algebraically distinct from one another (not just
three copies of one another). This may prove to be a
valuable condition for a model which ultimately describes
the fermion mass spectrum.
Our goal now is to describe the standard model’s full
set of states, in its entirety.
The machinery at our
disposal consists of a 256 C-dimensional incarnation of
Cl(8), generated by C ⊗H ⊗O. The question is then:
How should this algebra act on itself so that it splin-
ters into all the familiar elementary particle representa-
tions? Should the algebra act via left multiplication? Lie
bracket? Anti-commutator? Here we outline one possible
answer to the question.
The algebra“RC←−
HO”≡R⊗C⊗←−
H ⊗←−
O is deﬁned as the
left-action maps of R⊗C⊗H⊗O on itself. It can easily be
seen to generate a faithful representation of the Cliﬀord
algebra Cl(8). Take for example the eight generators
γj ≡iej
j = 1 . . . 6,
γ7 ≡ǫ1e7,
γ8 ≡ǫ2e7,
(24)
where ej are the standard octonionic imaginary units,
and ǫ1, ǫ2, ǫ3, are the standard quaternionic imaginary
units.
These generators satisfy the Cliﬀord algebraic
anti-commutation relations
{γn, γm} = 2δnm
n, m = 1 . . . 8.
(25)
From these generators we may then deﬁne the element
γ9 ≡γ1γ2γ3γ4γ5γ6γ7γ8 = ǫ3e7,
(26)
from which we can construct idempotents
P1 ≡1
2(1 −ǫ3e7),
P2 ≡1
2(1 + ǫ3e7).
(27)
The algebra RC←−
HO is subject to an anti-automorphism,
∼, deﬁned by sending ei 7→−ei and ǫj 7→−ǫj for

7
i = 1 . . . 7, and j = 1 . . . 3, while reversing the order
of multiplication. Additionally, we may then deﬁne what
we will call the hermitian conjugate as † ≡∗∼, where we
compose ∼with ∗. The involution ∗is the usual complex
conjugate that maps the complex imaginary unit i 7→−i.
B.
Multi-actions
We are now ready to deﬁne a generalized multiplication
rule, which we will call the †-multi-action. The †-multi-
action is a map from two elements a, b ∈RC←−
HO to a third
element, m†(a, b), which is also in RC←−
HO.
m†(a, b) ≡
2
X
i=1
Pia Pib + Pib a†Pi.
(28)
Similarly, we will deﬁne the ∼-multi-action as
m∼(a, b) ≡
2
X
i=1
Pia Pib + Pib eaPi.
(29)
These multi-actions m† and m∼generalize the SU(3)c
action demonstrated in this paper, and also may be
loosely viewed as a linearization of those actions intro-
duced in Chapter 3.4 of [27].
These new actions m† and m∼are called multi-actions
since they (each) single-handedly split RC←−
HO into
(1)
Lie algebras,
(2)
Jordan algebras, and
(3)
spinor spaces.
That is, a multi-action supplies the respective multipli-
cation rules to each of these subspaces, simultaneously. It
also supplies the multiplication rules between these sub-
spaces. As readers will see below, m† and m∼introduce
a Z2 grading, reminiscent of a supersymmetry algebra.
With the introduction of these multi-actions, we may
now identify certain Lie algebras L† and L∼in RC←−
HO as
L† ≡P1 RC←−
HO P1 + P2 RC←−
HO P2
−† conjugate
(30)
using the action m†, and
L∼≡P1 RC←−
HO P1 + P2 RC←−
HO P2
−∼conjugate
(31)
using the action m∼. Similarly, certain Jordan algebras,
J† and J∼, may be deﬁned as
J† ≡P1 RC←−
HO P1 + P2 RC←−
HO P2
+ † conjugate
(32)
using the action m†, and
J∼≡P1 RC←−
HO P1 + P2 RC←−
HO P2
+ ∼conjugate
(33)
using the action m∼.
Finally, spinor spaces may be identiﬁed as
Ψ ≡P1 RC←−
HO P2 + P2 RC←−
HO P1,
(34)
with the possibility of constructing Majorana representa-
tions by adding the complex conjugate. As vector spaces,
it is easy to see that
L† ⊕J† ⊕Ψ = RC←−
HO = L∼⊕J∼⊕Ψ.
(35)
Clearly, this incorporates the idea of Peirce decomposi-
tion of algebras. These representations will be interesting
to study in the context of the derivations, structure alge-
bras, and conformal algebras deﬁned in [42]. Also, those
familiar with Eilenberg algebras, [43], will readily ﬁnd
close connections to these structures.
Readers are encouraged to verify that m† and m∼each
map Lie algebra elements Li, Jordan algebra elements
Jj, and spinors Ψk, in a fashion which in limited ways
mirrors a susy algebra:
m(Li, Lj) = [Li, Lj]
∈L,
m(Ji, Jj) = {Ji, Jj}
∈J,
m(Ψi, Ψj) + m(Ψj, Ψi) = ΨjΨ⋆
i + ΨiΨ⋆
j
∈J,
m(Ψi, Ψj) −m(Ψj, Ψi) = ΨjΨ⋆
i −ΨiΨ⋆
j
∈L,
m(Li, Ψj) = LiΨj
∈Ψ,
m(Ji, Ψj) = JiΨj
∈Ψ,
m(Li, Jj) = [Li, Jj]
∈J,
m(Ji, Lj) = {Ji, Lj}
∈L,
m(Ψi, Lj) = 0,
m(Ψi, Jj) = 0,
(36)
where
⋆
is
meant
to
represent
one
of
the
anti-
automorphisms, as the case may be.
In summary, we have just introduced the notion of
a multi-action.
A multi-action can be thought of, in-
tuitively, as a machine which splits and processes our
original algebra into Lie algebras, Jordan algebras, and
spinor spaces. When this machine is given a pair of ele-
ments from the Lie algebraic subspace, it processes them
via a commutator, so as to output another Lie algebraic
element. When it is fed a pair of elements from the Jor-
dan algebraic subspace, it processes them via an anti-
commutator, so as to output another Jordan algebraic el-
ement. When this machine is fed a Lie algebraic element
and a spinor, it can output a linearized transformation
on that spinor, and so on. In short, a multi-action can
be thought of as a generalized multiplication rule, which

8
simultaneously orchestrates the behaviour of a collection
of algebraic objects, each familiar to physics. It is with
the RC←−
HO multi-actions m† and m∼, or some variation
thereof, that we hope to uncover the group representation
structure of the standard model.
C.
Preliminary ﬁndings
Now when constructing a ﬁeld theory, we might hope
to associate these ﬁelds with certain special invariant sub-
spaces of R ⊗C ⊗←−
H ⊗←−
O. (See [27] section 2.3.) Specif-
ically,
Ψ + Ψ∗
∼
fermions,
J
∼
gauge bosons,
(37)
with ﬁeld strengths to be built up from gauge bosons
in the usual way. We propose associating gauge bosons
with elements of a Jordan algebra based on the observa-
tion that certain Jordan algebras can generalize the 2×2
hermitian matrices, much in the way that Aa
µγµΛa gen-
eralizes pµσµ from the Weyl equation. Of course, care
must be taken to ensure that our new gauge ﬁelds indeed
transform correctly.
It is clear from this construction that we have more
than one Jordan algebra to choose from. One natural
option may then be to consider the intersection of the
Jordan algebras we have available. Let us then consider
the Jordan algebra J†∩J∼. Upon calculation, readers will
ﬁnd that this algebra J† ∩J∼is 28 + 28 R-dimensional.
On the other hand, the Lie algebra L† ∩L∼is 36 + 36 R-
dimensional, and appears to be given by two copies of the
symplectic algebra sp(8, R). These details, among many
in this addendum, are yet to be more carefully conﬁrmed.
Now incidentally, ∼and † are not the only anti-
automorphisms of R ⊗C ⊗←−
H ⊗←−
O. We furthermore have
ρ, the well-known reversal anti-automorphism of Cl(8).
This reversal anti-automorphism sends any vector in the
Cliﬀord algebra’s generating space to itself, and likewise
maps the identity element to itself, [44]. Beyond reversal,
we may build a further anti-automorphism by composing
reversal, ρ, together with the automorphism of grade in-
volution, α. Grade involution is an automorphism which
maps the Cl(8) generators γν 7→−γν, and leaves the
identity element invariant.
With these new anti-automorphisms, ρ and αρ, we
may easily construct analogues of the multi-actions (28)
and (29). From here, it is then straightforward to ﬁnd a
broader range of Jordan and Lie algebras: Jρ, Lρ, Jαρ,
Lαρ, Jρ∗, Lρ∗, etc. These Lie and Jordan algebras may
then in turn be used to construct further intersection al-
gebras. For example, we ﬁnd that Lρ∩Lαρ∩Lρ∗is 28+28
R-dimensional, and appears to be given by two copies of
the so(8) Lie algebra.
The most tightly constrained Jordan and Lie intersec-
tion algebras we have at this point may be expressed as
Jρ ∩Jαρ ∩Jρ∗∩J∼and Lρ ∩Lαρ ∩Lρ∗∩L∼(or equiv-
alently, Jρ ∩Jαρ ∩J† ∩J∼and Lρ ∩Lαρ ∩L† ∩L∼, or
...). We ﬁnd that both the Jordan and Lie intersection
algebras are 16 + 16 R-dimensional, and the Lie algebra
appears to be given by two copies of u(4). In fact, this
ﬁnal Lie algebra appears to embody the more general
identity sp(2n, R) ∩so(2n) = u(n). Clearly, this u(4) Lie
algebra could in principle include at least the standard
model’s unbroken gauge symmetry su(3)c. However, we
are yet to ﬁnd an exact match to the standard model’s
full set of gauge symmetries.
One option under investigation is to consider not just
the left action of R⊗C⊗H⊗O on itself, but rather both
the left and right actions. The chain algebra in this case
generates a faithful representation of the larger Cliﬀord
algebra Cl(10). From here we may attempt to generalize
our Lie algebra structure to sp(10, R) ∩so(10) = u(5).
Once u(5) is obtained, only one simple step is subse-
quently required so as to obtain the standard model’s
su(3)C ⊕su(2)L ⊕u(1)Y , together with an additional
u(1)X, as explained in [45], [29], and [47].
With the multi-actions and the intersection algebras
now deﬁned, we will demonstrate precisely why these
proposals deserve further investigation.
Let us consider the generators iΛj of SU(3) ⊂Aut(O),
represented as in equations (2).
Readers may conﬁrm
that the iΛj reside in the Lie algebra Lρ∩Lαρ∩Lρ∗∩L∼.
Inputting a = iΛj and b ∈RC←−
HO into multi-actions (28),
(29), or their analogues, will clearly lead to the same
result.
m( iΛj, RC←−
HO ) =
P2
i=1 Pi iΛj Pi RC←−
HO −Pi RC←−
HO iΛjPi.
(38)
Under this action, we ﬁnd the breakdown of RC←−
HO into
SU(3) representations as follows:
RC←−
HO 7→
(4 × 8) ⊕
(24 × 3)
⊕(18 × 1) ⊕
(4 × 1) ⊕
(24 × 3∗) ⊕(18 × 1) ⊕
(4 × 1) ⊕
C36,
(39)
where C36 is a 36 C-dimensional space, to be discussed
shortly. It should be noted that the representations listed
above are over the ﬁeld C, which would seem to introduce
a doubling in the number of degrees of freedom, rela-
tive to what one might expect of standard model states.
However, this may be addressed by considering those sub-
spaces invariant under complex conjugation i 7→−i, as
proposed in relations (37), and the paragraphs that fol-
low them, [27].
Clearly, this breakdown (39) comes quite close to those
SU(3)c representations we ﬁnd in the standard model,
now with the capacity to accommodate spin and polar-
ization. To be speciﬁc, the ﬁrst 220 degrees of freedom
described in this decomposition do indeed exhibit SU(3)c

9
behaviour we see in elementary particle physics. If we
were to construct the standard model by starting out
with four real degrees of freedom allocated for the space-
time indices of each gauge boson, and four real degrees
of freedom per spinor, then the above states could (for
example) account for eight gluons, one photon, one Z bo-
son, three generations of left- and right-handed quarks,
three generations of left-handed leptons, and three gen-
erations of right-handed charged leptons.
Still left to
describe would be W bosons, the Higgs, and potentially
right-handed neutrinos.
Now the remaining available space, C36, is something
of a curiosity. Under the action (38), we ﬁnd that C36
behaves as two copies of 3 ⊗3 = 6 ⊕3∗, plus its com-
plex conjugate. In corroboration with the recent work of
Gording and Schmidt-May, [36], we ﬁnd that it might be
possible to alleviate extraneous-su(3)c tension by having
such states act on Ψ from the right hand side, instead of
the left. In this case, triplet transitions may be identi-
ﬁed as transitions between generations instead of colour.
Said another way, one may seek out special conditions
under which Ψ may be reinterpreted as Ψ⋆. Clearly this
topic will be subject to further investigation.
