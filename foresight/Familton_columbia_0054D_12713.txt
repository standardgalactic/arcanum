ABSTRACT 
Quaternions: a history of complex                                                                
Noncommutative rotation groups in theoretical physics 
Johannes C. Familton 
     The purpose of this dissertation is to clarify the emergence of quaternions in order to 
make the history of quaternions less opaque to teachers and students in mathematics and 
physics. ‘Quaternion type Rotation Groups’ are important in modern physics.  They are 
usually encountered by students in the form of: Pauli matrices, and SU(2) & SO(4) 
rotation groups. These objects did not originally appear in the neat form presented to 
students in modern mathematics or physics courses. What is presented to students by 
instructors is usually polished and complete due to many years of reworking. Often 
neither students of physics, mathematics or their instructors have an understanding about 
how these objects came into existence, or became incorporated into their respected subject 
in the first place. This study was done to bridge the gaps between the history of 
quaternions and their associated rotation groups, and the subject matter that students 
encounter in their course work.

CHAPTER I 
INTRODUCTION 
     In recent years the introduction of quaternions in various, perhaps in disguised 
forms, has become part of the education of undergraduate mathematics and physics 
students; yet most of these undergraduate students learn this subject without 
encountering any historical or scientific motivation from which the mathematics 
evolved. Despite the importance of ‘Quaternion type Rotation Groups’ in modern 
physics--usually in the guise of the rotation groups: SU(2), SO(4), and Grassmann 
Algebras--students of modern physics have little or no exposure about how these 
mathematical objects came about. The purpose of this dissertation is to clarify the 
emergence of quaternions in order to make the history of quaternions less opaque to 
teachers and students in mathematics and physics. 
     The journey of quaternions started as a geometric and algebraic curiosity in the mid-
19th century. Soon they were found to have applications in mechanics; then later that 
century they were applied to electromagnetism via Maxwell’s equations. The physics 
of the past century: quantum mechanics and relativity, string theory, super-symmetry 
and quantum gravity, also found uses for quaternion type-rotation groups. For example, 
students taking a course in undergraduate quantum mechanics or modern physics 
encounter complex non-commutative rotation groups in the guise of Pauli matrices 
(Griffiths,1994, p.156; Sakurai, 1994, p.168). In mathematics this subject is generally 
skipped over. If mathematics students do encounter quaternions or their associated 

 
 
2
rotation groups it would be in the form of exercises or part of an appendix in a linear 
or modern algebra course (Birkhoff & Maclane, 1977, p. 258 ; Artin, 1991, p.123 and 
p.155). 
A. Need for the study 
     Although the history of the quaternion rotation group is well documented, often it 
is not made clear how rotation groups were introduced into physics in the first place 
and why they took such deep a hold, especially in modern physics.  
     While there are many authoritative works for physics professionals, little is available 
that is appropriate for others. Moreover, the rich history of quaternions is rarely 
mentioned, even in advanced technical works, due to the limited availability of this 
information. The history of quaternions and their associated rotation groups as it relates 
to physics does not have a unified source from which college instructors of mathematics 
and physics can draw. The need for this sourcebook was brought to the author’s 
attention by a couple of the readers of the sourcebook. This sourcebook would allow 
instructors to incorporate historical materials into their teaching of rotation groups 
making it a useful addition to curricular resources. 
B. Purpose of the study 
     The purpose of this study is to prepare a sourcebook for mathematics and physics 
instructors providing an historical perspective of quaternions and their cousins the 
rotation groups SU(2), Special Unitary Group 2, SO(4), Special Orthogonal group 4, 

 
 
3
both types of rotation groups occur frequently in advanced physics courses, especially 
in quantum mechanics or particle physics courses. Other subjects that come up in 
physics courses such as Clifford and Grassmann algebras also incorporate quaternion 
structures.  This study will seek to provide: 
1. The historical development of rotation groups in their original guise of 
quaternions and how they developed into the more familiar rotation groups 
students encounter today. 
2. The history of the incorporation of quaternions and rotation groups into 
classical physics: mechanics and electromagnetism.   
3. The history of the incorporation of quaternions and rotation groups into modern 
physics: quantum mechanics and relativity theory. 
     A source book of this kind should be useful to historians of science; as well as 
mathematicians, physicists and educators who want to integrate the historical 
development of complex non-commutative rotation groups into their teaching in order 
to give a deeper understanding of the subject matter. 
     The historical goals of the sourcebook required an extensive review of original 
literature. Some of this literature was originally written in Latin, the language of 
educated people up through the 19th century, and English. The people who discovered 
and worked with quaternions, William Rowan Hamilton and his followers, were 
English speakers and wrote most of their work in English. No translations are needed 

 
 
4
in these cases, and direct quotations will be used. The translations of non-English 
sources presented here are the available academic translations and noted in the 
Bibliography. 
     The philosophical perspective, the technical language, and the notation changes as 
quaternions evolve into Grassmann algebras and into the theory of non-commutative 
complex rotational groups, so following the historical development is especially 
challenging in the absence of a source book. 
C. Procedures of the study 
     In order to fulfill the purpose of this study, the following strategies were followed: 
1. Present the history of the development of complex non-commutative rotation 
groups as a purely mathematical development. 
2. Show how these developments initially became incorporated into theoretical 
physics in the first place. 
3. Show how these developments became incorporated into current theoretical 
physics literature and textbooks. 
4. The source book has been submitted to a selection of mathematicians and 
physicists who both teach and do research in quaternions and associated areas.  
5. The evaluations obtained were summarized, as well as suggestions on how the 
source book can be amended.

6. This dissertation includes the initial questionnaire and answers. The author 
questioned the participants further and included a summary of their responses 
and anecdotal assessments in Chapter V.   
7. The final amended version of the source book is included in this dissertation 
in Chapters II-IV 
     All sourcebook technical exposition will be at a level appropriate for a well-prepared 
instructor of undergraduate mathematics and physics who is familiar with these types 
of rotation groups and wants to have a better historical sense about what they are 
teaching. Far too often instructors are only aware of the polished version what they are 
teaching, thus giving students the illusion that this is the way these structures were from 
the beginning, when they were first discovered. Students are rarely exposed to in their 
textbooks or by their instructors the years of struggle that had gone into what they are 
learning. 
      The purpose of this sourcebook was to initially prepare a draft for further review 
by a ‘jury’ of readers who are familiar with the subject or related subjects in order to 
insure the quality and usefulness of this sourcebook. This ‘field trial’ consisted of six 
instructors who have encountered this subject matter in their teaching or research. The 
reports of the jurors were the basis for refinement of the preliminary version of the 
source book.

Chapter II 
HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF QUATERNIONS 
 
     Quaternions have become a common part of mathematics and physics culture, but 
little is discussed about how quaternions came into being. In this chapter the author will 
discuss the history of quaternions and their relatives. These types of rotation groups have 
become a part of the mathematics and physics diet of the 21st century.     
     The obvious question is “What are quaternions?” The next question asked is “How 
and why quaternions were invented in the first place?” In this chapter the author answers 
some of these questions.  
A. What Are Quaternions? 
      A complex number, is defined by a + bi, where a, b are real numbers and i is called 
an imaginary number. The number i is not part of the real number system and has the 
property i2= -1. The idea of a square root of -1  as it comes up in an equation of the form 
𝑥2 + 𝑎= 0   when solving for x. This is the reason that complex numbers came into 
existence in the first place. Complex numbers are defined as being a two dimensional 
vector space over the real numbers. A basis vectors of this vector space is {1, i}. Complex 
numbers are added component-wise:  (a+bi) + (c+di) = (a+c) + (b+d)i; multiplication 
is determined by the distributive law and i2 = -1:  (a+bi)(c+di) = ac + adi + bci+bdi2 = 
(ac-bd) + (ad+bc)i. 
     A quaternion is an extension of the complex number system. Quaternions are called 
this because they have four basis vectors (1, i, j, k). The word quaternion itself however 
was not coined by Hamilton. In fact   according to the Merriam-Webster dictionary 

 
 
7
quaternion is a middle-English word, referring to a set of four parts/persons/things. 
Hamilton, according to his biographer Robert Graves, discussed the etymology of the 
word quaternion  
The word "Quaternion” requires no explanation, since, although not now very 
commonly used, it occurs in the Scriptures and in Milton. Peter was delivered to 
"four quaternions of soldiers" to keep him; Adam, in his morning hymn, invokes 
air and the elements “which in quaternion run." The word (like, the Latin 
"quaternio," from which it is derived) means simply a set of four, whether those 
"four" be persons or things.(Graves, 1889, p.635) 
 
     Quaternions have three imaginary components called  i, j, k that are three different 
square roots of -1, meaning i2=j2=k2=-1. Quaternions can be also written as (q0, q1, q2, 
q3) or q0+q1i+q2j+q3k  where q0, q1, q2, q3 are real coordinates.  
     Now that quaternions have been defined the next step would be how to add them. 
Addition with quaternions is done component-wise the same way it is done with complex 
numbers. With the multiplication of quaternions things become a bit more complicated.  
This is what held Hamilton up for more than 10 years. The key to multiplying quaternions 
turned out to be: ij=k=-ji, jk=i=-kj, ki=j=-ik.  This rule makes multiplication non-
commutative since ij is not the same as ji, meaning that ij≠ji etc.  As far as is known, 
William Rowan Hamilton was one of the first to look at a non-commutative system of 
numbers (Lambek, 1995, p. 8).  
B. William Rowan Hamilton and the discovery of Quaternions: 
    The main difficulty, as mentioned, in the development of quaternions was how to 
define multiplication. Hamilton was looking for a way to formalize 3 points in 3-space 
in the same way that 2 points can be defined in the complex field, C (Lam, 2003, p. 230). 

 
 
8
Hamilton thought about this problem for over 10 years. As legend goes, on October 16, 
1843, Hamilton solved the multiplication problem while taking a walk with his wife on 
what is today the Broome Bridge in Dublin, Ireland. His insight was that i2 = j2 = k2 = 
ijk = -1. Hamilton was so excited about his insight that it is said that he stopped and 
carved this formula on Broom Bridge. The carving can no longer be seen, but where it is 
believed he carved the equation, a plaque has been placed. (Hamilton, 1854, p. 492-499, 
p. 125-137, p. 261-269, p. 446-451, p. 280-290,).    
       It was known in Hamilton’s time that complex numbers correspond to points in a 
two dimensional space or plane. When in the complex number field multiplying them 
causes a rotation of the plane.  The idea of points in a 2-dimensional space was already 
known in the 17th century by Descartes. The problem that Hamilton encountered for over 
a decade was that he was trying to find a more general kind of number that could extend 
points into a 3-dimensional space, where there was not a need for coordinates to describe 
them.  
       Recall that complex numbers are written (a+bi) where i2 = -1.  Hamilton had tried 
to extend this by first writing (a+bi+cj) where i2 = j2 = -1.  The issue that came up was 
that in order to get a formula for multiplication he would have to decide what the product 
is, say, of ij .  He knew that the formula would be inconsistent unless it satisfied what he 
called ‘the law of moduli’.  This means that that when complex numbers are multiplied 
(a + bi)(c + di) = (ac-bd) + (ad+bc)i. Hamilton was looking for a 3-dimensional analogy 
to what occurs in the  2-dimensional complex plane.  As it turned out what Hamilton was 
really 
looking 
for 
was 
something 
analogous 
to 
‘triplets’, 
where 
if 

 
 
9
(a+bi+cj)(d+ei+fj)=u+vi+wj then the ‘law of moduli’ would require that 
(a2+b2+c2)(d2+e2+f2)=u2+v2+w2. This was the issue that Hamilton was confronted with.  
No doubt he tried many different possible configurations but couldn’t find one that would 
work for his particular system (Leng, 2011, p. 63). 
     About his struggle trying to find a solution to ‘triplets’ Hamilton wrote in 1865 to his 
son “Every morning in the early part of the above-cited month (October 1843), on my 
coming down to breakfast, your (then) little brother William Edwin, and yourself, used 
to ask me: `Well, Papa, can you multiply triplets?' Where to I was always obliged to 
reply, with a sad shake of the head: `No, I can only add and subtract them.'” (Halberstam, 
1967). Hamilton’s difficulty was that he couldn’t find a three-square identity. The reason 
being is that a three-square identity doesn’t exist.   
     Hamilton was, no doubt, aware of the four-square identity discovered by Euler in 
1749. This identity states (a12+a22+a32+a42)(b12+b22+b32+b42)=(a1b1–a2b2–a3b3–
a4b4)2+(a1a2+a2b1+a3b4–a4b3)2+(a1b3–a2b4+a3b1+a4b2)2+ 
(a1b4+a2b3–a3b2+a4b1)2  
(Weisstein, 2002, 952). What could have occurred to Hamilton while walking with his 
wife on October 16 is that he might have better success if he used ‘quadruples’, 
(a+bi+cj+dk), rather than ‘triples’.   
     If he let i2 = j2 = k2 = -1, he then needed to determine the products ij, jk, etc. He might 
have tried to do it in such a way that the multiplication formula would correspond to the 
expressions in Euler’s identity.  Perhaps that is what could have gone through Hamilton’s 
mind at the time, is that he could accomplish what he was looking for by letting these 
products be non-commutative, in other words: ij=-ji=k, jk=-kj=i, ki=-ik=j, leading to 

 
 
10
‘the law of moduli’. Thus in order to preserve distance, absolute value, Hamilton had to 
give up commutativity. It was these equations that he is believed to have carved on 
Broome Bridge that October day (Hamilton , 1854, p. 492-499, p. 125-137, p. 261-269, 
p. 446-451, p. 280-290).    
     The question that Hamilton struggled with for over 10 years was whether or not 
multiplication could be defined in a 3-dimentional or higher vector space over the real 
numbers, and would result in a field.  It turns out that in 4 dimensions the best that can 
be done is to define multiplication as non-commutative by doing this the result cannot be 
a field, but is referred to as a division ring (i.e. the quaternions) (Byrne, 2013, p.15 ). 
      Hamilton’s interest in quaternions is said to have developed from his interest in 
algebra and by reading Kant’s Essay on Algebra as the Science of Pure Time written 
1835.(Steffens, 1981, p.843-844) Hamilton wrote “Time is said to have only one 
dimension, and space to have three dimensions…The mathematical quaternion 
partakes of both these elements; in technical language it may be said to be ‘time plus 
space’, or ‘space plus time’: and in this sense it has, or at least involves a reference to, 
four dimensions. And how the One of Time, of Space the Three, Might in the Chain of 
Symbols girdled be." (Graves, 1889, p.635). It appears by this quote that Hamilton may 
have had some kind of insight into a connection between space and time, and its 
relationship to quaternions, but this may not be how we understand space-time today.           
     The influence of Kant’s work on Hamilton has been debated.  This debate is discussed 
by Michael Crowe in his book A History of Vector Analysis  

 
 
11
“It is generally believed that Hamilton's stress on time was derived from Kant. 
Such may not be the case, for Kant's name is never mentioned in the paper…In 
1835 Hamilton wrote: ‘and my own convictions, mathematical and meta-
physical, have been so long and so strongly converging to this point (confirmed 
no doubt of late by the study of Kant's Pure Reason), that I cannot easily yield 
to the authority of those other friends who stare at my strange theory.’ (Graves, 
1835, p. 142) It thus seems that at most Kant served as a catalyst for the 
development of his ideas and as a confirmation of them.” (Crowe, 1967, pp.24-
25) 
     This is an interesting observation, but it is the opinion of the author of this thesis 
that time as some kind of special parameter unto itself is not a necessary component 
for understanding the concepts related to quaternions and their association with rotation 
groups. Thus Kant’s influence on Hamilton’s work is possible, but not necessary to 
understand the development of Hamilton’s work. 
     Soon after discovering quaternions, Hamilton connected quaternion algebra to 
spatial rotations. It is an interesting fact that this relationship had been discovered 
earlier by Olinde Rodrigues.  Hamilton was unaware of Olinde Rodrigues’ discovery 
since Rodrigues’ work was rather obscure in the world of mathematics. This is not true 
of his secular life. Olinde Rodrigues made his real mark as a social reformer. He was 
an early advocate of socialism arguing for racial and gender equality. By trade he was 
a banker, becoming wealthy by supporting the French railway system. He used his 
wealth to support the social causes that he believed in (O'Connor & Robertson, 2006).   
     As a mathematician it appears as though Rodrigues had a better understanding of 
the algebra of rotations then Hamilton did (Chapter 3 Section D). It is said that 

 
 
12
Rodrigues also had the beginnings of what would later become Lie algebras (Altmann, 
1986,  p.201). (Chapter 3 Section G)  
     Hamilton was so pleased with the outcome of his quaternion system that he founded 
a school devoted to the study of quaternions that he called ‘quaternionists’ 
(Ebbinghaus, H.-D. et al,1991, 193).  Hamilton wrote a long treatise, Elements of 
Quaternions, in an attempt to popularize them. The book is 800 pages. It was published 
shortly after his death in 1866. It is a rambling work that is not easy to read, as the 
author of this thesis discovered. It appears that Hamilton was never able to find a 
satisfactory interpretation how quaternions were related to ‘vectors’. This would later 
be clarified by Gibbs and Heaviside.  
     Peter Tait, became Hamilton’s successor in continuing the quaternion crusade. 
Quaternions became an examination topic in Dublin University (Ebbinghaus, H.-D. et 
al,1991, 192).  American students in the late 19th century were introduced to 
quaternions via ‘Topics Courses' as they are called today. For example, during this 
time, the University of Michigan and Harvard offered quaternions as a part of their 
mathematical curriculum. (Tucker,2013,p.690) . Benjamin Peirce taught this type of 
course in Harvard. He included quaternions as one of his ‘topics’. This was a part of a 
larger mathematics course that was offered at that time. It was his enthusiasm for 
quaternions that aided the founding and promotion of the ‘cult’ of quaternions 
(Kennedy, 1979, pgs. 423-424).   
      Benjamin Peirce’s son James Mills Peirce along with Thomas Hill, also from 
Harvard University were the impetuses behind the ‘cult of quaternions’. James Mills 

 
 
13
Peirce was attracted to quaternions through his father who according to Crowe did more 
to promote an interest in quaternions than anyone else in the U.S. (Crowe 1967, p.125). 
It was Yale educated Shunkichi Kimura of Japan who founded the professional society 
“International Association for Promoting the Study of Quaternions and Allied Systems 
of Mathematics.” (Kennedy, 1979, p. 425; Struik, 1967, p.172).  For example this 
fellowship presented material and published in prestigious journals such as Nature 
(Kimura & Molenbroek ,1895, pp.545–6) and Science  (Kimura & Molenbroek ,1895, 
pp.524–25).  
     By the mid 1880’s quaternions were being replaced by the vector analysis that Gibbs 
and Heaviside developed. Subjects that would have been described in terms of 
quaternions, now used vectors. Vector analysis is conceptually easier, and the notation 
is clearer then quaternions. This was fine for 19th century classical physics, but with the 
advent of subjects like quantum mechanics the limitations of vector analysis became 
more apparent and quaternions were rediscovered in the form of Pauli spin matrices. 
    Hamilton believed his work on quaternions was his most important contribution to 
mathematics. Thus towards the end of the 19th century quaternions took a ‘back seat’ 
to other methods i.e. vector analysis for many classical applications. Today, however 
few students and professionals would feel comfortable with, or be able to, comprehend 
quaternions because they think in terms of the vector analysis that they learned in 
school. Hamilton's original definitions would be both unfamiliar and fundamentally 
different from what modern students or instructors would be familiar with.

      One of the interesting reasons for the reappearance of quaternions in the later 20th 
century was the development of computer animation and other applications involving 
computer programing. This appears to have happened because quaternions use algebra 
to describe spatial rotations. This makes quaternions more ‘compact’ than matrices, thus 
when programed into computers they can be computed ‘faster’ than matrices (Shoemake, 
1985, pp.245-254; Chi, 1998). The reason that quaternions are faster than matrices is that 
rotation matrices contain sines and cosines, but quaternions do not.  Quaternions also 
have only 4 scalars, where the matrices that are usually used for these types of programs 
have 9 (Gruber, 2000).       
     Hamilton himself was not sure of how to apply quaternions in the context of his own 
era. He originally conceived of them as a geometric curiosity. It appears that he thought 
about their applications but only after he had worked out the actual quaternion 
mathematical system. It does not appear the physics applications were an integral part 
of their development.  Hamilton did put some thought into possible applications for 
quaternions since he was also interested in physics. He wrote in a letter to Graves about 
his quaternion application musings,   
“There seems to me to be something analogous to polarized intensity in the pure 
imaginary part; and to unpolarized energy (indifferent to direction) in the real part 
of a quaternion: and thus we have some slight glimpse of a future Calculus of 
Polarities. This is certainly very vague,…” (Hamilton, 1844, pp.489-495)  
 
Ultimately this task was left to his student Tait.

C. Grassmann: A more Geometric approach to Algebra 
 
     While Hamilton was developing quaternions another mathematician, Hermann 
Günter Grassmann (1809 – 1877), was working on a more geometric approach to 
conceptually similar issues. Grassmann was perhaps more motivated by applications 
then Hamilton was. Grassmann developed a system that put geometry into an algebraic 
form. This approach, unlike quaternions, is not bounded by 3-dimensional space. This 
was an unusual idea for Grassmann’s time, since most mathematicians and physicists 
were bounded by 2 or 3 dimensional space. He also incorporated non-commutative 
multiplication into his system, a cutting-edge idea for his time, making Grassmann a 
man truly ahead of his times.   
     In order to do this Grassmann developed a language that was rather esoteric by 
contemporary standards.  As Carl Friedrich Gauss put it in a letter to Grassmann  in 1844:  
“… in order to discern the essential core of your work it is first necessary to become 
familiar with your special terminology. …however that will require of me a time free of 
other duties …” (Grassmann, 1844, p.331). 
           Grassmann was one of the tragedies of mathematics due to the neglect his work 
received during his own lifetime. Grassmann used ideas that are part of modern vector 
analysis before Hamilton developed quaternions. Grassmann also developed a many-
dimensional analog to what are called cross products today, he called these the exterior 
products. In his work Grassmann included topics that are now considered part of vector 
analysis. For example he included vector addition, subtraction, differentiation, and 
function theory. (O'Connor and E F Robertson, 2005).             

 
 
16
        Once the esoteric nature of Grassmann’s mathematical language is overcome, it 
turns out that his algebras were for applications, simpler to use, in general, then 
Hamilton’s quaternions. Grassmann first began to apply his ideas in his Theorie der Ebbe 
und Flut: Prüfungsarbeit 1840 (Theory of tides) (Grassmann, 1840). He then saw that 
he could go beyond his own initial applications, in 1844 he published, Die Lineale 
Ausdehnungslehre which contains vector analysis still in use today. (Crowe, 1967, p. 65). 
In 1877 Grassmann published Die Mechanik nach den Principien der Ausdehnungslehre, 
with the help of his brother. He compared this work to his earlier works writing that: 
“Without exception (except for changes of notation here and there), the methods 
which I use in this paper and the equations to which I get by means of them, I have 
already submitted, in a work about the theory of the tides, at Pfingsten 1840 as an 
examination paper at the scientific examination commission in Berlin…Very little 
of Extension Theory has changed since 1844.” (Grassmann, 1877, p. 222).  
 
He also says in his introduction that he was encouraged by what he read in Kirchhoff, to 
go back and continue his research in extension theory and its applications “The newer 
textbooks and papers in mechanics, namely, G. Kirchhoff’s Lectures (1875, 1876) show 
me that the presentation of these methods will also be useful today, as it was thirty-seven 
years ago…” (Grassmann, 1877, p. 222). In this paper he elaborates on how his ‘calculus’ 
can be applied to mechanics in general.  Unfortunately Grassmann’s work is not easy to 
read. 
           In his preface to one of the early text books using Grassmanns’s methods     E.W. 
Hyde, a great admirer of Grassmann’s work stated “… the great generality of 
Grassmann's processes – all results being obtained for n-dimensional space - has been 
one of the main hindrances to the general cultivation of his system…” (Hyde, 1890,p.v). 

 
 
17
This may have been one of the main reasons that mathematicians of the time didn’t have 
the patience to delve deeper into Grassmann’s work and truly appreciate what he was 
doing.  
    Grassmann came from a well-educated family, and went to good private schools in 
Stettin, Germany the town where he was born. He remained in Stettin most of his life 
except when he went to the University of Berlin. Despite the fact that he had more 
academic and personal advantages then most, he was not well appreciated as a scholar, 
not even by his own father. His father, master of the Gymnasium that he attended, thought 
that Hermann should be a gardener, craftsman or some other type of laborer. Grassmann 
went the University of Berlin in 1827 where he studied mainly linguistics and theology. 
According to O'Connor & Robertson, it does not appear that Grassmann studied or took 
any formal courses in mathematics or physics (O'Connor & Robertson, 2005).  
          Grassmann was a self-taught, self-made mathematical scientist in the truest sense. 
He was one of the few mathematicians who successfully applied his own mathematical 
discoveries to problems in physics. 
        In the fall of 1830 Grassmann returned from college to his home town, Stettin. There 
he decided that he would earn a living as a school teacher and do research on his own 
time.  
       In the spring of 1832 Grassmann got a job as an ‘assistant teacher’ in his former 
Gymnasium at Stettin. It was about this time that Grassmann started applying algebra 
to geometry. He wrote in the preface of Die Lineale Ausdehnungslehre, ein neuer Zweig 
der Mathematik, (Linear Extension Theory, a New Branch of Mathematics) that he 

 
 
18
encountered, while working on his thesis on the theory of the tides, Lagrange’s work 
Méchanique analytique (Analytical Mechanics). This inspired him to go “…back to the 
ideas of the analysis.” (Grassmann, 1844, p.vii) He also mentions, in a footnote on the 
same page, that he got some of his basic ideas from Laplace's Méchanique celeste 
(Celestial Mechanics).  
         In 1861 he published the second edition Die Lineale Ausdehnungslehre, ein neuer 
Zweig der Mathematik (Linear Extension Theory, a New Branch of Mathematics). This 
is one of the true mathematical masterpieces of the era. It essentially was a rewritten 
version of his earlier 1844 work. He expanded his earlier work, and took out the 
philosophical comments. He also changed it to the standard definition, theorem and 
proof way of writing. He probably hoped that by making these changes his work would 
attract more established mathematicians and scientists. Unfortunately this was not the 
case. 
D. Gibbs and Heaviside: Combining Hamilton and Grassmann 
      Grassmann ultimately did leave his legacy through Josiah Gibbs, a professor at Yale 
in the United States of America. Gibbs was inspired by Maxwell’s Treatise on Electricity 
and Magnetism (1873). Gibbs was unhappy with quaternions and how they were being 
applied to physical problems. In Europe Grassmann’s ideas were noticed by Hermann 
Hankel and Victor Schlegel.  
     On the other side of the Atlantic Ocean, English engineer Oliver Heaviside also saw 
issues with applying quaternions to physical problems. Unlike Gibbs, Heaviside was not 

 
 
19
university educated, but a self-taught mathematical scientist in his own right. These two 
men were independent discoverers of, what is called today, vector analysis. 
i. 
Gibbs: a well-educated American 
     Josiah Willard Gibbs (February 11, 1839 – April 28, 1903) is the same Gibbs that 
chemistry and physics students encounter when they learn about ‘Gibbs free energy’ in 
thermodynamics classes.  
     Gibbs was a professor of mathematical physics at Yale. He originally did his PhD in 
electrical engineering. He was the first in Yale to receive a PhD. in that subject. Gibbs 
was aware of Grassmann’s work and wanted to make it more useful for his own scientific 
research.  In a letter to Victor Schlegel in 1888, Gibbs makes it clear about how his ideas 
about vectors were inspired by Maxwell’s Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism (1873).  
“…where Quaternion notations are considerably used, I became convinced that 
to master those subjects, it was necessary for me to commence by mastering those 
methods. At the same time I saw, that although the methods were called 
quaternionic, the idea of the quaternion was quite foreign to the subject. I saw 
that there were two important functions (or products) called the vector part & the 
scalar part of the product, but that the union of the two to form what was called 
the (whole) product did not advance the theory as an instrument of geom. 
investigation.” (Crowe, 2002, pp.12-13) 
 
     Due to misunderstandings about quaternions versus vectors Tait, Hamilton’s favorite 
student of quaternions, became a rival of Gibbs. Tait in his preface to the third edition of 
Elementary Treatise on Quaternions (1890) says that, “Even Professor Gibbs must be 
ranked as one of the retarders of Quaternion progress, in view of his pamphlet on Vector 
Analysis, a sort of hermaphrodite monster, compounded of the notations of Hamilton and 
Grassmann.” (Crowe, 1967, p.150; Pritchard, 2010, p.239). Although it is unclear exactly 

 
 
20
how Tait viewed Gibbs work as a ‘hermaphrodite monster’; in the arguments that 
occurred between Tait and Gibbs, Gibbs focused mainly on the use of sums, scalar and 
vector products in order to solve physical problems. “As fundamental notions there is a 
triviality and artificiality about the quaternionic product and quotient, he argued” 
(Pritchard, 1998, p.239).    The arguments “went on with the quatenionists emphasising 
algebraic simplicity and mathematical elegance and the vector analysts giving weight to 
naturalness and ease of comprehension”. (Pritchard, 1998, p.240).     
     Gibbs also found quaternions limiting in their scope since they could not be used to 
analyze more than three dimensions. This bothered Tait since he did not see any use for 
more than three dimensions, like most scientists of his day.  He responded in the journal 
Nature “What have students of physics, as such, to do with space of more than three 
dimensions?” (Tait , 1891, p.512). The need for more than three dimensions would 
become clear in the early 20th century, but may have not have been so obvious in the late 
19th century. 
     Gibbs found that what could be done using vectors could be done, in principle, using 
quaternions, but with more effort. Thus the controversy became less about vectors versus 
quaternions, but more about vectors with or without the concept of quaternions as an 
integral part of its methodology.  
ii. 
Heaviside: the self-taught English electrician  
     The other scientist who is credited for bringing vectors into the scientific lexicon was 
an English electrician Oliver Heaviside (May 18, 1850 –February 3, 1925). Heaviside, 

 
 
21
like Gibbs, learned about quaternions when he was studying Maxwell’s theories.  He 
found that setting up the equations using quaternions required a lot of work. For him they 
were “…very inconvenient. Quaternionics was in its vectorial aspects antiphysical and 
unnatural.” (Heaviside, n.d.b, p.136) One of the outcomes was that when Heaviside, like 
Gibbs, removed what they considered the difficult parts, they inadvertently also 
removed what might be considered the more conceptually interesting parts of 
quaternions. By doing this Heaviside ‘opened the doors’, along with Gibbs, for the 
controversy with Tait and his followers. This controversy became part of Nature from 
around 1890 – 1894 (Wisnesky, 2004, p.14). Heaviside said later about his own use of 
quaternions “I dropped out the quaternion altogether, and kept to pure scalars and 
vectors, using a very simple vectorial algebra in my papers from 1883 onward.” 
(Heaviside, n.db,  p.136) 
      Heaviside had a very different background from Gibbs. Heaviside was born in a 
rough neighborhood in London.  His aunt married Charles Wheatstone. This marriage 
became the ‘saving grace’ for Oliver Heaviside and his brothers. Wheatstone was a 
professor of physics at Kings College London. This is the same Wheatstone that 
invented the ‘Wheatstone bridge’ of elementary physics and engineering that students 
learn today. The ‘Wheatstone bridge’ is a way to measure an unknown electrical 
resistance. Wheatstone was also one of the inventors of the telegraph.  He introduced 
the three Heaviside boys to the world of electricity. Oliver and his brother Arthur 
decided to take advantage of their connection to Wheatstone and decided to pursue 
careers related to the telegraph. This allowed them access to some of the ‘state of the 

 
 
22
arts’ electrical laboratories of the era.  The two brothers were involved in laying cable 
lines for telegraphs. When Oliver was in his mid-twenties he decided that he was more 
interested in doing research in electrical theory then a career the telegraph business. He 
decided to go back home and live with his parents. His parents had an ‘extra room’ 
where he lived for the rest of his life. His brother Arthur supported his research interests 
while remaining in the telegraph business (Hunt, 2012, p.49). 
     In 1873 Heaviside published On the Best Arrangement of Wheatstone's Bridge for 
Measuring a Given Resistance with a Given Galvanometer and Battery  (Heaviside, 
1892, pp.3-8). This work attracted the attention of William Thomson (known also as 
Lord Kelvin). It also was noticed by James Clark Maxwell.  Maxwell was impressed 
enough by Heaviside that he cited him in the second edition of Treatise on Electricity 
and Magnetism (Hunt, 2012, p.50).Through this connection, Heaviside was able to 
secure a copy of Maxwell’s Treatise as soon as it came out.  
     Heaviside became aware of Gibbs work from an unpublished pamphlet version of 
Vector analysis 1881-4. Heaviside concluded that “Though different in appearance, it 
was essentially the same vectorial algebra and analysis to which I had been led.” He 
saw Tait’s adherence to a ‘quaternions only’ attitude as “…extremest conservatism. 
Anyone daring to tamper with Hamilton's grand system was only worthy of a 
contemptuous snub.” Heaviside remarked later in his introduction that, in time, Tait did 
come around and ‘soften’ a bit (Heaviside, n.db, p.136).  
      Heaviside used the symbols  𝑎̅, 𝑏̅ for vectors; 𝑎̅. 𝑏̅ for scalar products, 𝑉𝑎̅𝑏̅ for 
vector products in his Electromagnetic theory (Heaviside, 1893) and Wilson who wrote 

 
 
23
Vector Analysis based on Gibbs’s Lectures used the notation A, B to denote vectors; 
A.B and A×B for scalar and vector multiplication respectively (Wilson, 1901 pp.265-
281). Today dot product (A∙B) is used for scalar multiplication and cross product (A×B) 
is used for vector multiplication. It was Clifford in 1877 in his book Elements Dynamic 
in the section Product of Two Vectors who introduced the notation that is familiar today 
(Crowe, 2002, p.12). Thus during the formative development of vector analysis the 
notation was not as transparent as it is today. 
       It has been noted by Michael J. Crowe in his book A History of Vector Analysis-
The Evolution of the Idea of a Vectorial  that in our modern understanding of vector 
analysis  
“It is not possible to argue that the quaternion system is the vectorial system 
of the present day; the so-called Gibbs-Heaviside system is the only system 
that merits this distinction.  Nor is it legitimate to argue that the quaternion 
system will be the system of a future day. Both of these alternatives are 
unacceptable; nonetheless it can be argued … that Hamilton's quaternion 
system led by a historically determinable path to the Gibbs-Heaviside system 
and hence to the modern system.” (Crowe, 1985, p.19) 
 
     It is the opinion of the author of this thesis that Crowe tends to look at the history of 
vector analysis too much on side of Gibbs and Heaviside, and does not give Grassmann 
his due. The Gibbs-Heaviside system is not the only vectorial system deserving merit.  
Grassmann was an essential part of this development and also deserves more merits in 
this distinction then it appears Crowe is willing to give.

E. The Joining of Quaternions with Grassmann algebras : William Kingdon 
Clifford 
     William Kingdon Clifford (1845-1879) lived a relatively short life; he died of 
tuberculosis on March 3, 1879 at the age of 35. Clifford had a prodigious background. 
He went to Kings College London at only 15 years old. When he was 18 he went on to 
Trinity College in Cambridge. After graduating from Trinity he became professor of 
applied mathematics at the University College of London when he was 23. (MacFarlane, 
1916, pgs. 49-50) 
     Clifford, like Gibbs and a few others, discovered Grassmann’s work, and was very 
impressed by it. As a result he published Applications of Grassmann's Extensive Algebra 
in 1878. In this paper Clifford looks for a simpler and more general way to look at 
algebras in higher dimensions. He noticed that Grassmann algebras and quaternions are 
not really in conflict with each other as may have been previously believed. Thus with a 
little tweaking Clifford was able to resolve the apparent issues that existed between the 
two systems.  Clifford put his motivation for writing this paper in the following quote: 
 “…thereby explaining the laws of those algebras in terms of simpler laws. It 
contains, next, a generalization of them, applicable to any number of dimensions; 
and a demonstration that the algebra thus obtained is always a compound of 
quaternion algebras which do not interfere with one another.” (Clifford, 1878, 
p.350) 
 
    It should be noted that when Hamilton discussed ‘vector’, he was not using this 
concept the way that they are understood today. Hamilton understood ‘vector’ to mean 
the non-scalar part of a quaternion equation.  

 
 
25
     Clifford’s paper On The Classification of Geometric Algebras (Clifford, 1882, p.397) 
was not discovered until after his death. This paper became the basis for Clifford algebras 
as they are known today. This is perhaps Clifford’s greatest contribution to mathematics, 
unfortunately he never finished this paper and it was not found in good condition (Diek, 
n.d.,p.4). 
      What essentially Clifford did was to make the connection between Grassmann’s 
algebra and Quaternions by first noting their differences:  
  “The system of quaternions differs from this (Grassmann’s approach), first in 
that the squares of the units, instead of being zero, are made equal to - 1 ; and 
secondly in that the ternary product ι1ι2ι3, is made equal to - 1. : The 
interpretation is at the same time extended to three dimensions, but with this 
restriction: that whereas the alternate units represent any three points in a plane, 
and the system deals primarily with projective relations, Hamiltonian units 
represent three vectors at right angles, and the system is the natural language of 
metrical geometry and of physics.” (Clifford, 1882, p.399)  
     Clifford makes it clear that his work was a way to connect Grassmann’s and 
Hamilton’s ideas. This is what Clifford’s work on Geometric Algebras was about. 
Clifford also had no intension of changing or breaking away from quaternions. What 
he wanted to do was to ‘streamline’ them. He wanted to give a more complete and 
simpler presentation of the ideas that both Hamilton and Grassmann presented in their 
work. His intention was to make Hamilton’s ideas more palatable to physical scientists. 
This he did by making a method that could more easily be used for calculation while 
not having to give up the conceptually interesting parts of either quaternions or 
Grassmann’s algebras.  Geometric algebras, unlike vectors, are not merely a ‘special 

 
 
26
case’ of quaternions, but incorporate the deep conceptual nature of quaternions that was 
lost in vectors. 
      Clifford in 1878 incorporated ideas from both Grassmann’s extensive algebras and 
Hamilton’s quaternions.  Clifford did not claim that these ideas were his.  This becomes 
a problem when trying to attribute Geometric Algebra to one specific founder.  Hestenes 
said “Let me remind you that Clifford himself suggested the term Geometric Algebra, 
and he described his own contribution as an application of Grassmann's extensive 
algebra” (Hestenes, 1993, p.2). Clifford did not consider this work ‘original’, but a 
synthesis of the best of both the Grassmann’s extensive algebras and Hamilton’s 
quaternions. The depth and subtlety of Clifford’s work is not ‘easy’ to understand, but 
once understood can be very satisfying.  
F. Sophus Lie 
     The history of the rotation groups being discussed in this thesis cannot be 
appreciated fully without having some understanding of Lie Groups and Algebras, 
since these structures have had a major impact on modern theoretical physics.  These 
structures are named after the mathematician who discovered them, Sophus Lie (1842-
1899).  
     Sophus Lie was born December 17 1842, in the rural village of Nordfjordeide in 
Norway to a Lutheran pastor and his wife. He was the youngest son of six children. Lie 
went to the standard elementary and high school schools that existed in Norway at the 
time (Hawking, 1994, p.6). 

 
 
27
     Lie went to Christiania University (now University of Oslo), where he completed 
his PhD with the dissertation in 1871 on Uber eine Classe geometrischer 
Transformationen (About a class of geometric transformations). This dissertation 
covered issues about what is called today differential geometry. 
    Up until Lie completed the PhD. he earned his living tutoring. He really didn’t find 
anything in the main stream mathematics curriculum  that captured his mathematical 
or intellectual passions until he read Jean-Victor Traité des propriétés projectives des 
figures (Treaty of projective properties of figures) (1822) and  Théorie des polaires 
réciproques (Theory of Reciprocal Polars) published in Crelle's Journal 1829. While 
reading Poncelet around 1868, Lie was introduced to complex numbers in projective 
geometry. Lie also read Julius Plücker’s System der Geometrie des Raumes in neuer 
analytischer Behandlungsweise (System of the geometry of space in new analytical 
method of treatment) published in Crelle's Journal 1846. Plücker's used the 
displacement points in space to represent lines, curves, and surfaces. This inspired Lie 
to publish his first paper in 1869 Repräsentation der Imaginären der Plangeometrie 
(Representation of imaginary numbers in plane geometry). This paper covered 
essentially his mathematical interests, rather than incorporate original ideas that would 
be usually associated with a research paper.  None the less, despite the superficial 
nature of the paper he managed to win him a fellowship to the University of Berlin. 
This opened doors for him to meet other mathematicians and students of mathematics. 
During his stay in Berlin he met fellow student Felix Klein. Even though Klein was 
seven years younger than Lie they had a deep and productive mathematical 

 
 
28
relationship. Lie and Klein shared similar mathematical interests they both wanting to 
take Plücker's ideas and develop them further. In order to do this they decided that they 
would go to Paris in the spring of 1870. Their intentions was to expose themselves to 
the latest French mathematical fashions of the day (Helgason, 2002, p.4).  
     About 3½ years after his rendezvous in Paris with Felix Klein, Sophus Lie 
discovered his theory of continuous groups. It is this discovery that Lie is most 
remembered for, especially in physics. This was the beginning of what is called today 
‘Lie Group Theory’. Lie decided to take a special type of transformation group, and 
use these groups to solve differential equations. The first compact Lie group that he 
discovered is called SU(2). This group is closely connected to quaternions. It was also 
anticipated by Rodrigues two years before Lie was born. 
    Lie was disappointed that other mathematicians didn’t take much notice to his work. 
He wrote to his friend Adolf Mayer in 1884: "If only I knew how to get mathematicians 
interested in transformation groups and their applications to differential equations. I am 
certain, absolutely certain, that these theories will sometime in the future be recognized 
as fundamental. If I wish such a recognition sooner, it is partly because then I could 
accomplish ten times more." (Helgason, 2002, p.14).   
      Noticing how isolated Lie was mathematically, his old friend Klein sent one of his 
students to work with him starting in 1884. Friedrich Engel was 22 years old and stayed 
for nine months. According to Engel this was the happiest and most productive period 
of his life (Helgason, 2002, p.15). 

 
 
29
       When Klein left his position in the University of Leipzig in 1886, Lie became his 
successor. This catapulted Lie from his quite isolated life in Christiania University to 
mainstream mathematical life of Leipzig University. Despite the recognition that he 
received in Leipzig he still felt unappreciated, although during this time Lie and Engel 
worked on transformation groups and produced Theorie der Transformationsgruppen 
(Theory of Transformation Groups) (O'Connor & Robertson, 2000).  
     This was not a small undertaking. The work consisted of three volumes. It was 
published between 1888 and 1893. Lie was in poor health during this time, so Engel 
did most of the ‘real’ work, where Lie would sketch out the problem or proofs and 
Engel would fill in the details. (O'Connor & Robertson, 2000).  
      Due to what we would call today ‘depression’ Lie returned to his alma mater, 
Kristiania University September1898. Lie was 56 when he died of pernicious anemia, 
in which the body is unable to make healthy red blood cells.  This disease is caused by 
a lack of vitamin B12 in one’s diet (O'Connor & Robertson, 2000; Gale, 2005-2006). 
      So far what this thesis has given is a historical overview of the mathematical 
‘zeitgeist’ of the times and some of the mathematicians who were involved in these 
discoveries. Today Lie Algebras are often employed along with Grassmann’s Algebras 
and Clifford’s algebras form a main part of the theoretical physics intellectual diet. The 
question that remains is how and why the revival of quaternions and their relatives 
came about. In the next chapter the author will go deeper into some of the mathematical 
ideas introduced in this chapter and, hopefully, offer an answer or at least some thought 
to this question in the final chapter.

Chapter III 
MATHEMATICAL DEVELOMENT 
      In the previous chapter of this thesis a historical overview was given about where 
quaternions came from and some of the mathematicians who discovered and worked 
with quaternion type groups, but that was only part of the story. In this chapter the 
mathematics that was developed will be discussed in more depth. The following will 
not be a comprehensive investigation into the mathematics of these rotation groups, but 
merely an overview of some of the more important and/or interesting ideas that came 
out of their mathematical investigations. It is important to see how the mathematics 
developed, and how the techniques evolved and became incorporated into the lexicon 
of modern theoretical physics. 
A. Algebra of Quaternions 
 
      Some of the basic properties of quaternions were introduced at the beginning of this 
dissertation. A more extensive analysis of quaternions will be given in this section.   
     Most of the following definitions were retrieved from Goldstein’s Mechanics third 
edition (Goldstein, 2000, p.310), Penrose’s book Spinors and Space-time Volume 1 
(Penrose,1984, pp.21-24), Quaternions and Rotations in 3-Space: How it Works (Chi, 
1998, pp.1-10), various web pages on quaternions including Wolfram MathWorld web 
pages (Weisstein,1999-2014;Weisstein, 2002), to name a  few of the references used. 
These are standard definitions that can be found in most books and papers that cover 
this subject.

     In order to add quaternions let P = (p0+ip1+jp2+kp3) and Q = (q0+iq1+jq2+kq3) be 
two quaternions.  Addition is defined component-wise; it is both commutative and 
associative.  That is P+Q = (p0+ip1+jp2+kp3) + (q0+iq1+jq2+kq3) = 
(p0+q0)+i(p1+q1)+j(p2+q2)+k(p3+q3).  For example, if P = 3 − i + 2j + k and Q = 2 + 
4i −2 j − 3k, then P + Q = 5 + 3i – 2k (Chi, 1998, 2) 
      Hamilton imposed the distributive law on the units 1, I, j, k obtaining pq = (p0 + p1i 
+ p2j + p3k)(q0 + q1i + q2j + q3k) = p0q0 + p0q1i + p0q2j + p0q3k + p1q0i + p1q1i2 + 
p1q2ij + p1q3ik + p2q0j + p2q1ji + p2q2j2 + p2q3jk + p3q0k + p3q1ki + p3q2kj + p3q3k2 . 
Applying the ‘quaternion rules’ letting i2 = j2 = k2 = -1 and ij=-ji=k, jk=-kj=i, ki=-ik=j:  
pq= p0q0 + p0q1i + p0q2j + p0q3k + p1q0i  –  p1q1 + p1q2k  –  p1q3j + p2q0j  –  p2q1k  –  
p2q2 + p2q3i + p3q0k + p3q1j  –  p3q2i  –  p3q3. It is straight forward to verify the 
distributive law for 3 quaternions, r(p + q) = rp + rq. In standard form the ‘scalar part’ 
is written first and the ‘vector part’ second, in the order i, j, k as pq = p0q0 – (p1q1 + 
p2q2 + p3q3) + (p0q1 + p1q0 + p2q3 – p3q2)i + (p0q2 - p1q3 + p2q0 + p3q1)j + (p0q3 + p1q2 
– p2q1 + p3q0)k (Chi, 1998, p.3).  
       Quaternions can be written in the form q0 + q.  The real number q0, is referred to 
as the scalar part, and  q=iq1+jq2+kq3 is referred to as the vector part of the quaternion. 
Quaternion multiplication can be compared to the modern dot and cross products by 
the following calculation. Let P = p0 + p and Q = q0 + q where p = p1i + p2j + p3k and 
q = q1i + q2j + q3k. Then continuing in a straightforward manner it can be shown that 
PQ = p0q0 - p·q + p0q + q0p + p × q  (Weisstein, 2002, pp.2446-2448).

     The conjugate is defined. They are defined in the same way as for complex numbers. 
Recall a complex number z = a+bi . The complex conjugate is defined as ̅z  = a – bi. 
Extending this idea to quaternions, Q=q0+q then its conjugate is defined as Q* = q0 – 
q  it follows that (Q*)*=Q, (P + Q)* = P* + Q*, QQ*=Q*Q and less trivially that  
(PQ)* = Q*P*. To show that this is true Let p0q0 + p0q + pq0 + pq , using Hamilton’s 
notation let PQ = S.pq + V.pq. Expanding and musing the definition of  commutatively 
and anti-commutatively of quaternions to get (PQ)* = p0q0 – p0q – pq0 + S.pq  – V.pq  
switching p for q and q for p to get (PQ)* = p0q0 – p0q – pq0 + S.pq  + V.pq . Now let 
Q*P* = (q0 – q)( p0 – p) = q0p0 – q0p  –qp0 + S.pq  + V.pq. Note that the vector part 
(V.pq) is anti-commutative and therefore the sign changes and (PQ)* = Q*P* since 
their result is the same.(Jia, 2015, 3) 
    The norm is defined as follows: 
|𝑄| = √𝑄∗𝑄= √𝑞0
2+𝑞1
2+𝑞2
2+𝑞3
2 = |𝑄∗| 
This is analogous to a vector in 4-space. The norm of a quaternion is multiplicative, 
meaning that the norm of the multiplication of many quaternions is equal to the 
multiplication of the norms of quaternions (this is Hamilton’s law of moduli): 
 |𝑃𝑄| = √𝑃𝑄(𝑃𝑄)∗= √𝑃𝑄𝑄∗𝑃∗= √𝑃|𝑄|2𝑃∗= √𝑃𝑃∗|𝑄|2 = √|𝑃|2|𝑄|2 = |𝑃||𝑄|.  
     Quaternions have an inverse, Q-1. If Q=q0+iq1+jq2+kq3 then its inverse is defined 
to be. Non-zero quaternions have multiplicative inverses defined by 𝑄−1 =
𝑄∗
|𝑄|2. The 
inverse for this property  𝑄𝑄−1 =
𝑄𝑄∗
|𝑄|2 =
|𝑄|2
|𝑄|2 = 1. 

 
 
33
     Recall that unit quaternions have the property that |Q| = 1. This fact was used in the 
earlier proof on rotation preservation, where it was assumed that a unit quaternion is 
defined as  𝑄−1 =
𝑄∗
|𝑄|2 = 𝑄∗. 
    In continuing define a group as having the following properties:  
1. Closure, means if a, b are elements of G then when they are multiplied, ab this 
is also an element of G.  
2. Associativity, this means that if a,b,c are elements of the group G then a(bc) = 
(ab)c. 
3. Existence of an identity element, often denoted by e, where ae = ea = a for all 
elements of G.   
4. Existence of inverses, this means that for all a elements of G then there exists a 
unique element a-1 that is also in G where aa-1=a-1a=e 
(Herstein, 1996, p.40).  
Properties 1-3 are obvious, but it still must be shown that quaternions satisfy 
uniqueness. Uniqueness means that there are not any non-zero divisors. It turns out that 
quaternions that quaternions do satisfy this property making it a division ring. 
      The multiplication group of non-zero quaternions has a subgroup, often called a 
‘quaternion group’ containing 8 elements as shown I Table 1. This is completely 
analogous to the multiplication group {1, -1} in R and to the multiplication group {1, 
-2, I, -1} in C.

     An interesting way to remember the multiplication of quaternions is by using the 
Fano plane analogy (Figure 1). To use this analogy for quaternions, for example, 
multiplying ij, go clockwise in the diagram to k. This means that ij=k. But when 
multiplying ji, go counterclockwise, which is the negative direction, i.e., ji = -k (Beaz, 
2001, p.151).      
     
 
      A different idea is conjugation by Q, also referred to as double multiplication. This 
is done in the following way: if Q is a unit quaternion (QQ* = 1) then ‘conjurgation by 
Q’ changes any quaternion p into QpQ*. Note that this operation doesn’t have a

counterpart in complex numbers, since it would leave p unchanged. Thus if P = p0 + p-1 
then after conjugation by Q this leaves p0 unchanged and rotates p around the axis of q 
by twice the angle of between Q and the real axis in 4-dimensional quaternion space. 
This can also be expressed by the following theorem: 
Theorem 1: If P=p0 + p, and P’ = QPQ-1, where QQ*=Q*Q=1 then  
P = p0 + p  where |p|=|p’|  
Proof:   
1. p0 commutes with Q so Qp0Q* = p0QQ* = p0 
2. 2S.(QpQ*) = (QpQ*) + (QpQ*)* = QpQ* + Qp*Q* = Q(p – p)Q*=0. Therefore 
Q-1pQ* is a pure vector. 
3. |QpQ*|= |QpQ*||QpQ*|*=QpQ*Qp*Q*=Qpp*Q* = Q|p|2Q* =|p|2QQ* = |p|2 
. ■ (Ho Ahn, 2009; Shoemake, n. d., 4 ) 
Theorem 2: p’ is obtained by rotating p about q through an angle θ, where θ/2 is the angle 
in quaternion 4-space between Q and the real axis.  
Proof:  Refer to Figures 2 and 3:

1. Choose  k  to point along q  then Q = q0 + q3k and tan θ/2 = q3/q0. As before 
let p = p1i + p2j + p3k where p’3 = p3 , since QkQ* =kQQ* = k|Q|2 = k.  
2. If p = p1i + p2j + p3k then p’= p’1i + p’2j + p’3k  where p3 =  p’3 since  QkQ* 
=kQQ* = k.  
3. In order to show that φ = θ = 2(θ/2) Let M = PQ*; multiplying by M on the 
right, obtain so that P = MQ. Also P’ = Q(PQ*)=QM. Now choose the i and j 
axis so that m lies in the i, k plane. Then M = m0 +m1i  + m3k and therefore   
p1i + p2j + p3k = (m0 +m1i + m3k)(q0 + q3k)  
p’1i + p’2j + p’3k  = (q0 + q3k) (m0 +m1i + m3k)  
     Similarly for P = MQ  = (m0 +m1i + m3k)(q0 + q3k) so that  
p1 = q0m1 = p1’ , p2 = -q0m1 = -p2’, and p2’p1 = -q3/q0 = - tan(θ/2) 
It follows that the rotation from p to p’ consists of two rotations each by angle θ/2  ■  
B. Gibbs Vector analysis and Quaternions 
     As would be expected there are similarities and differences between the two 
systems.  It is these two approaches that will be discussed in more detail in this 
subsection.    
     The word ‘vector’ grew out of Hamilton’s quaternions. Recall that Hamilton coined 
the vector and scalar parts of the quaternion. The notation used today is from Gibbs in 
his original Vector Analysis (Gibbs,1901, pp.17 - 50, pp.50 – 90).  

 
 
37
     According to Joseph C. Kolecki of the Glenn Research Center in Cleveland, Ohio a dyad is 
a tensor of rank 2. This means that it is a system that has magnitude with two directions 
connected to it (Kolecki, 2002, 4). In general a tensor is an object that obeys specific 
transformation rules. 
    What is called a tensor today is essentially a generalization of a scalar and vector, 
where a scalar is a tensor of rank zero, and a vector is a tensor of rank one. The rank of 
a tensor defines the number of directions it has, where a dyad has 2 directions and 
magnitude, thus it is a rank 2 tensor. This means that mathematically that it can be 
described by 9 entries or components in a 3×3 matrix.  
      Gibbs textbook Vector Analysis was published in 1901 by Edwin Bidwell Wilson.  It 
was based on lectures that Gibbs gave at Yale. In this book triple vectors are used. The 
concept of the dyad is introduced in Chapter V Linear Vector Functions. 
     Gibbs starts by discussing the dot and cross products. He probably noticed that if he 
wrote the vector product as just ab this didn’t mean anything, but   ab ∙ c  did mean 
something, namely a(b ∙ c). The parentheses were not needed to express this relationship 
since there is only one way to understand this expression. Seeing this he may have 
thought, perhaps, that the expression ab could be denoted by its dot-product by a vector 
such as c, meaning that   
(ab) ∙ c means the same as a(b ∙ c), where  both expressions could be written without the 
parentheses. By seeing this it gave meaning to ab. This is what Gibbs called a dyad. To 
summarize formally a dyad can be defined as a pair of vectors say a, b where the dyad 

 
 
38
is, D(ab) ≡ ab, and its the scalar or dot product is defined to be a∙bc ≡ (a∙b)c and ab∙c ≡ 
a(b∙c). (Weisstein, 2003,841) 
    The next logical step would be to try to add dyads. The most obvious way to do this is 
by using a distributive law i.e. (ab + cd) ∙ e = ab ∙ e + cd ∙ e, and think of this as addition: 
(ab + cd). Unfortunately, in general, this is not a dyad. This means that for an arbitrary 
a, b, c, d there isn’t an f, g where ab ∙ e + cd ∙ e = fg ∙ e for every e. So he called (ab + 
cd) a dyadic, where dyadics are closed under addition, and dyads are not. 
      Vector Analysis uses somewhat different notation to denote dyads, and dyadic. 
Although the concepts are the same today, most modern readers are used to using 
matrices in order to understand these concepts. The modern text book form of vector 
analysis was best expounded by Gibbs. 
      A m x n matrix (m rows, n columns) can be multiplied by an n x p matrix by the rules 
of matrix multiplication

A vector a can be written as row matrix (a1  a2  a3), or as a column matrix,     (

) . The 
dot-product of these can be written as the row-column product:  𝒂𝒃=
(𝑎1
𝑎2
𝑎3) (
𝑏1
𝑏2
𝑏3
) = 𝑎1𝑏1 + 𝑎2𝑏2 + 𝑎3𝑏3 
The dyad, ab, can be written as the column-row product:  
𝒂𝒃= (

) (𝑏1

𝑎3𝑏3
) 
Here ab looks like a tensor, but it is a special kind of tensor, since,  in general tensors 
like T cannot be expressed as column-row products, but any T can be made by adding 
together at most three such products. When dyads ab are added together the outcome is 
something that is not a dyad. Due to this Gibbs called the result a dyadic.  
     Adapting the notation of Michael Spivak’s Calculus on Manifolds. 
Let T and T’ denote two vector spaces and 𝑇⨂𝑇′ is tensor product. The order of T and 
T’ is important since 𝑇⨂𝑇′ and 𝑇′⨂𝑇 are not the same thing. Tensors obey the following 
rules: 
1) (𝑇1 + 𝑇2) ⊗𝑇′ = 𝑇1 ⊗𝑇′ + 𝑇2 ⊗𝑇′ 
2) 𝑇⊗(𝑇′1 + 𝑇′2) = 𝑇⊗𝑇′1 + 𝑇⊗𝑇′1 
3) (𝑎𝑇) ⊗𝑇′ = 𝑇⊗(𝑎𝑇′) = 𝑎(𝑇⊗𝑇′) 
For a third vector space, say T”, (𝑇⊗𝑇′) ⊗𝑇" and 𝑇⊗(𝑇′ ⊗𝑇") are the same, so 
both are usually written as 𝑇⊗𝑇′ ⊗𝑇" (Spivak, 1965, p. 31)

C. Geometry of Quaternions 
     In this section a geometric interpretation of quaternions will be introduced. The idea 
of a division ring may not have been important for understanding vectors in the way 
Gibbs and Heaviside understood them, but they are important in order to understand 
the geometry of quaternions.  
     Usually the geometry of quaternions is understood in terms of rotations as illustrated 
in figures 4 and 5. The geometry of rotations will be explored here and their relationship 
to the Rodrigues' Rotation Formula will also be explored. 
 

 
 
41
 
i. 
Euler’s Rotation Theorem    
     Euler (1707 – 1785) was a very prolific mathematician who studied a wide variety 
number of mathematical fields. In this thesis the author refers to only one of the many 
contributions that Euler made in his long and varied mathematical career: his rotation 
theorem.  
     The reason that this theorem is important is that it will help to understand a sequence 
of rotations in 3-dimensions. This means that any rotation can be understood as a 
combination of a vector and a scalar. 
Euler’s Rotation theorem is as follows: 
Theorem: In whatever way a sphere is turned about its center, it is always possible to 
assign a diameter, whose direction in the final state agrees with that of the initial state. 
(Sten, n.d., p.19) 

 
 
42
     What this means is that if there is a sphere that is allowed to rotate freely about its 
center, then no matter what orientation it reaches, there are two places opposite each 
other (antipodal points) that have the same initial position.  
     Today the tendency is to describe Euler’s rotation theorem in terms of rotation 
matrices. Modern vectors make this proof rather straight forward:  
Euler’s Theorem on the Axis of a Three-Dimensional Rotation. If R is a 3 × 3 
orthogonal matrix (RTR = RRT = I) and R is proper (det R = +1), then there is a nonzero 
vector v satisfying Rv = v (Palais, 2009, p.892).   
      Euler didn’t have these tools of modern vector analysis. He used ingenious 
geometric methods to prove this. Unfortunately one of the issues that come up when 
looking at the modern form in terms of rotations is that the idea of a rotation is often 
confused with a rotation about an axis.  
ii. 
Quaternion Rotations in 3-Dimensions  
      One way to understand rotations in the plane is to use the Euler formula:  
eiφ=cos  + i sin  
where a  complex number is written z = x + iy in the form reiφ where r is the magnitude 
of z and φ is the angle that the vector (x,y) makes with the positive x axis.  Now z can 
rotate through any angle θ by multiplying z by eiθ since z’= zeiθ = reiφ eiθ = rei(θ+φ) .  So 
z’ = x’+ iy’ has the same magnitude as z but it makes an angle of  θ+φ with the x axis. 
Also x’ + iy’ = (x + iy)(eiθ )= (x+iy)(cos θ + i sin θ) = x cos θ – y sin θ + i(x sin θ + y 
cos θ). Collecting real and imaginary terms, we find the transformation in terms of a 2 
x 2 matrix: 

 
 
43
(𝑥′
𝑦′) = (cos 𝜃
−sin 𝜃
sin 𝜃
cos 𝜃) (𝑥
𝑦) 
(Ho Ahn, 2009b).  
     For Rotations in 3-dimensional space it is necessary to use conjugation. Two 
quaternion factors are needed in order to do an entire rotation θ.  Each of the quaternion 
factors carries an angle θ/2. The Euler’s formula eiφ = cos  + i sin , can be replaced 
by a quaternion formula Q = evθ/2 so that evθ/2 = cos(θ/2) + v sin(θ/2) where v = ivx + 
jvy + kvz, v is called a ‘pure quaternion’, Q has the unit norm.  
      Instead of z’ = zeiφ as would be for the Euler rotation formula, using the operation 
of conjurgation quaternion p’ = QpQ where p, p’ are ‘pure quaternions’ or the vector 
part of the quaternion. These can be written as p, p’, where p is the vector that will be 
rotated into p’. 
      A combination of rotations can be given by, say,   Q1 is followed by Q2 means that 
Q = Q2Q1, and  Q2(Q1PQ1*)Q2*=(Q2Q1)P(Q2Q1)*=QpQ.  
When going from the axis angle to the Quaternion angle, respectively, this is the 
process ‘doing’ the quaternion:  
 Start with the axis angle going into the Quaternion:   
Q = [cos(θ /2) + sin(θ /2)v]  
‘undoing’ a quaternion:  
Start with the quaternion going into the Axis Angle:   
θ=2tan-1(|q|/q0) and v=q/|q| where θ≠0  
(Mason, 2012, p.15; Van Verth, 2013).  

 
 
44
     In order to develop quaternions further as rotations, the concept of ‘pure 
quaternions’ is needed. Recall that the pure quaternions are the vector part of 
quaternions without the scalar part. These vectors are in 1-1 correspondence with R3. 
Thus a vector in R3 corresponds to the quaternion ‘pure vector’ Q = 0 +q1i+q2j+q3k. In 
order for quaternions to rotate in 3-dimensionsl space the rotation operator LQ is 
established, where LQ: R3 −> R3. If v = q1i+q2j+q3k then LQ (v) = QvQ* where v is an 
element R3 and Q is a unit quaternion, then v is also an element of H0 where H0 is the 
set of all ‘pure quaternions’. The following proposition is used to develop the 
quaternion rotation operator: 
Proposition: If for all v that are elements of H0 and for all Q that are elements of  H, 
then QvQ* = (Q02 − |Q|2)v + 2(Q · v)Q + 2Q0(Q ×v) => QvQ* is also an element of 
H0■ (Gravelle, 2006, p.8) 
     The rotation operator LQ is also a linear operator that preserves the length of the 
vector. It can be shown: 
Theorem 1: For any unit quaternion Q =  q0 + q = cos θ/2 +u 
 sin θ/2 and for any vector 𝐯∈𝑹𝟑 the action of the operator LQ(𝐯) = Q𝐯𝑄∗ on v may 
be interpreted geometrically as a rotation of the vector v through an angle θ about q as 
the axis of rotation. ■ (Kuipers, 2000, p.131) 
     This can be interpreted as the rotation of vector v via angle θ about Q. Where Q is 
the axis of rotation. This means that the process of rotating a point through an arbitrary 
axis using quaternions is a rather straight forward For example if a ‘pure quaternion’ if 
there is a vector r that is an element of R3 where r = 2i + 2j +2k where to rotate the 

 
 
45
point r about the vector s = 4i +4j at an angle θ=π/5. By using Theorem 1 the calculation 
can be done as follows:  
Let Q =cos (θ/2)+s/|s|sin(θ/2) then by substitution it can be written:

iii. 
Rodrigues' Rotation Formula  
 
     As mentioned in the previous chapter Rodrigues had a much stronger understanding 
of the algebra of rotations than Hamilton did. It is for this reason that the author has set 
aside an independent discussion of this rotation formula.  
     These rotations were discovered by a French-Jewish mathematician named 
Benjamin Olinde Rodrigues, prior to Hamilton. Rodrigues is known for two 
discoveries. The first one was part of his doctorate in mathematics for the Faculty of 
Science of the University of Paris in 1816.  In his dissertation he derived a formula for 
what is called today Legendre polynomials. His discovery, as it turned out, was an 
earlier version of Legendre polynomials making him an independent discoverer. 
(O'Connor & Robertson, 2006).  
      The other major contribution of Rodrigues, and the one of concern here, is referred 
to as Rodrigues rotation formula. He published this in 1840. The Rodrigues rotation 

 
 
46
formula is an algorithm for the composition of successive finite rotations using 
geometric methods. This really is essentially the same idea as the composition of unit 
quaternions. (O'Connor, 2006).  
 
      The Rodrigues’ rotation formula is v’  = z(z∙v) + (v– z(z∙v))cosθ +      
(v x z)sinθ as in Figure 6 where v’ is the result of rotating θ about the v axis. 
In Figure 6A, ON is along the z-axis and OW is the part of v that lies in the plane OPN. 
The circle containing arc PQ in 6A is a circle parallel to the x-y plane.  In 6B everything 
is projected onto the x-y plane. The quantity v┴ is the length of the projection of v.  
     The exponential Rodrigues rotation formula is given by rv(ϕ)=evϕ . This is an 
efficient way to map, so(3)  SO(3), where big SO(3) is the group of all rotations in 
three dimentions, and little so(3) is all 3 x 3 anti-symetric real matrices. This is also 
called a Lie algebra of SO(3) (Weisstein, 2002, p.2581).   

 
 
47
     What Rodrigues’ formula gives is an algorithm to compute the exponential map 
from the Lie Group to its corrsponding rotation group without having to compute the 
full exponential matrix.   The other Rodrigues rotation formula is the vectorial form; 
this is the one that is more useful for calculations.  In this form let the vector rotation 
corresponds to an angle, θ. Let this rotation be counterclockwise about a fixed z-axis. 
Let this vector be v where  v=(a,b,c) where a,b,c are elements of R , v=ax + by + cz 
and a corresponding vector v’ = ax’ + by’ + cz  is the image vector where x’ and y’  
These are rotated by angle θ where x and y are vectors in  the x, y plane. The rotation 
formula in 2-dimentions is given by x’ = x cos θ – y sin θ; y’ = x sin θ + y cosθ.  Use 
this to get v’ = cos θ(ax + by) + sin θ(ay - bx) + cz. 
     Let x and y be orthogonal in the plane. Then vector ax + by is a projection of v onto 
the x, y plane, and ay – bx is a 90 ͦ rotation.  Where v – (v ∙ z)z = v – cz = ax + by and 
z x v = a(z x v) + b(z x y) + c(z x z) = ay – bx. Substituting this into the equation for v’ 
to get: 
v’ = cos θ(ax + by) + sin θ(ay - bx) + cz = cos θ(v – (v ∙ z)z) + sin θ(z x v) + cz can be 
rewritten as  z(z∙v) + (v – z(z ∙ v))cosθ + (v x z)sinθ as in Figure 5  (Chang, 2013, p.1).  
      There are many different ways to derive Rodrigues' rotation formula; this was only 
one of them. The vectorial formula can also be derived from the exponential formula. 
This can be done in an elegent way. The author adapted the notes by Laura Downs and 
Alex Berg from Berkeley (Downs, n.d.).  This may have been the way Rodrigues first 
derived this formula, since it involves tools that were available to him at the time, such 
as Taylor’s series.

     Note that an n x n matrix A (real or complex) can be exponentiated  using the 
exponential Taylor series:  
𝑒𝑥= 𝐼+ 𝑥
1! + 𝑥2
2! + 𝑥3
3! + 𝑥4
4! + ⋯ 
Where if A is substuted for x the serise becomes  
𝑒𝐴= 𝐼+ 𝑨+ 𝑨2
2! + 𝑨3
3! + 𝑨4
4! + ⋯ 
This converges for all complex matrices A (Artin, 1991, p. 138-139) 
      Let matrix A  the linear transformation used to compute the cross product of the 
unit a particular vector a with arbartary vector, v. For example: 
𝒂× 𝒗= (
𝑎𝑦𝑣𝑧
−𝑎𝑧𝑣𝑦
𝑎𝑧𝑣𝑥

A rotation about the axis of a will change v by adding very small multaples of a x v = 
Av to it. Rodrigues’ insight was that a rotation through a finite angle θ would be given 
by v’ = eAθ ∙ v , provided that A is nornmalized by setting  | a |= 1  
      It is convient  to restrict A by requiring | a |2 = ax2 + ay2 +az2 = 1. From this a general 
member of so(3) is then recovered by multiplying the restricted A by a scalar θ. To do 
this eAθ needs to be computed.  
     Expand  eAθ as a Taylor series as follows: 
𝑒𝐴𝜃= 𝐼+ (𝐴𝜃)2
2!
+ (𝐴𝜃)3
3!
+ 𝐴𝜃4
4! + ⋯ 

 
 
49
In order to construct A start with any vector  v where A2v = a x (a x v) 
𝑨2𝒗 =  𝒂 × (𝒂 ×  𝒗) = 𝒂𝒂∙𝒗− |𝒂|2𝒗= (

) (𝒗) 
Where 𝐴2 = (𝒂)(𝒂) −𝑰 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑨(𝒂)(𝒂) = 𝒂× 𝒂(𝒂) ∴ 𝑨𝟑= 𝑨𝑨𝟐= −𝑨 
Thus each additional application of A turns the plane in the approperate direction, to get: 
𝑒𝑨𝜃= 𝐼+ [𝐴𝜃−𝐴𝜃3
3! + 𝐴𝜃5
5! + ⋯] + [𝐴2𝜃2
2!

= 𝐼+ 𝐴[𝜃−𝜃3

From this the Taylor expansions of sin (θ) and cos(θ) , eAθ becomes obvious, where the 
Euler formula can be writen as  I + A sin(θ) + A2 [1 - cos(θ)]. Where

D. Octonions  
     Hamilton came up with quaternions. He wrote to his friend John Graves about his 
discovery and revelation on Broom Bridge. Graves wrote back to Hamilton “If with your 
alchemy you can make three pounds of gold, why should you stop there?” (Beaz, 2001, 
p.146).  Three months later on December 26th Graves wrote to Hamilton about his 
discovery of a kind of ‘double-quaternion’ that he called ‘octives’, today are they are 
known as octonions. Hamilton said that he would announce Graves discovery to the Irish 
Royal Society; this was the way that mathematical ideas were published at the time. 

 
 
50
Unfortunately for Graves, Hamilton never got around to it, and in 1845 Arthur Cayley 
independently discovered the octonions, which became known as ‘Cayley numbers’. 
Thus due to Hamilton’s slipup Cayley beat Graves to publication and got the credit for 
them initially (Penrose, 2004, p.202). 
      Like quaternions, octonions form a division algebra, but unlike quaternions they are 
not associative. They are related to geometries in 7 and 8 dimensions. This wasn’t very 
useful in the 19th century physics.  Nineteenth century physics could barely deal with 4 
dimensions, so octonions were more of a mathematical curiosity than anything else. 
Octonions it appears were just a mathematical ‘fluke’. It wasn’t until the advent of 
modern string theory that octonions would find a place in theoretical physics. This took 
over a century for scientists and mathematicians to find a use for these numbers (Baez 
&Huerta, 2011, p.63). What is truly amazing is how an apparently whimsical discovery 
in the 19th century has become so important in 21st century theoretical physics.  
     Mathematically, octonions are the largest normed division algebra. ‘Normed’ means 
that they satisfy Hamilton’s law of moduli |ab|2=|a|2|b|2. When Hamilton discovered 
quaternions had to give up the commutative property in order to preserve the law of 
moduli; now the associative property has to be given up in order to preserve this law for 
the octonions. A multiplication table for octonions can be made like quaternions as 
follows: 
 
 

 
 
51
     
Table 2:  Multiplication table for 
Octonions. (Baez, 2001c) 
       
 
This multiplication table is not analogous to the Table 1 because it is not closed. In order 
to make it closed all the ‘negatives’ must be included in order to get a 16 x 16 table. Once 
it is filled in Table 2 would be analogous to Table 1. 
     During the latter part of the 19th century Killing and Cartan classified what are referred 
to as the ‘simple’ Lie groups. They also discovered the ‘exceptional’ Lie groups: F4, G2, 
E6, E7 and E8, all of which can be constructed using octonions. These exceptional Lie 
groups are the ones that are important to string theory, especially E8. (Baez, 2001b). 
John Baez of University of California, Riverside, has studied octonions extensively. 
     Some of the properties of octonions as they relate to quaternions are the 
multiplication table for octonions, Table 2, where e1,e2, and e3 represent the quaternions 
which are a subset of the octonions. (Baez, 2001a, p.150) 
       The Fano plane analogy for Octonions from table 3 of Cayley and Graves is shown 
in Figure 7. The Fano plane is the smallest projective plane.  Each of the lines on the 
triangular diagram contains three points.

The diagram has a total of 7 points.  Each of the triples has an oriented cycle ordered by 
the arrows that tell how to multiply them. Although Fano planes do not normally have 
arrows. The arrows were added to enable one to read off the sign of each product 
   
    
     For example:  ei,  ej,  and ek can be represented as follows: eiej = ek;  ejei = 
 -ek. Let 1 be the multiplicative identity. Let each circle in the diagram be represented by 
the relationship ei2 = −1. (Baez, 2001a, p.152; Richter, n.d.) 
E. Grassmann Algebras       
      Grassmann was a person who was truly ahead of his times. Not only did he 
anticipate Hamilton in non-commutative multiplication, but he also introduced the idea 
of n-dimensions, which is truly a modern concept. This is one of the reasons that 
Grassmann’s algebras or exterior algebras are considered to be more general than 
vector analysis. Grassmann’s algebras also came before both vector and tensor analysis 
Figure 7: 

 
 
53
and overlap both these subjects (Browne, 2001, 2). For this reason a more detailed 
mathematical description of Grassmann’s work will be discussed in this section. 
       For example, a vector is usually associated with a point P or a line from 0 to P. What 
Grassmann did was discuss situations where the lines didn’t necessarily go through 0. 
This idea allowed for greater generality. A line can now be ‘offset’, where an ‘offset’ line 
segment from P to Q, may be represented as vector b. Grassmann combines this with a 
vector a running from 0 to P, where their sum is the vector running from 0 to Q,  but 
Grassmann also defines a product which represents the area of the parallelogram (Figure 
6). This product is Grassmann’s exterior or wedge product ab  later called a ‘2-blade’ 
by Clifford . Continuing Grassmann defines abc  (Figure 8)  and so on to ant number 
of dimensions. Thus dimensions can be added, so that with each ‘offset’ an extra degree 
of freedom is added.  By adding and subtracting these ‘offsets’ new geometric objects 
can be developed. 
 
     The idea of the exterior product is similar to what is referred to today as linear 
independence. This is when points or vectors are non-zero the exterior product of this 
Figure 8: 

 
 
54
is considered to be linearly independent. To understand more about Grassmann’s 
reasoning let a line be defined by 2 connected points, a  plane by 3 connected points 
and so on.  For example the R2 is a vector space with a basis with unit vectors e1=(1,0), 
e2=(0,1). Let v = v1e1 + v2e2, w = w1e1 + w2e2 are a pair of vector, also called ‘bivectors’ 
or later called ‘2-blades’ by Clifford in R2,  where v and w, for example,  can be 
represented as two of the sides a parallelogram.  Their area is A = |det[v  w]|= |v1w2 – 
v2w1|.  This is called the exterior product or wedge product of v and w. Where the 
wedge product of v and w are vw = (v1e1 + v2e2)(w1e1 + w2e2). The distributive law 
holds where v1w1e1e1 + v1w2e1 e2 + v2w1e2e1 + v2w2e2e2. The wedge product 
alternates, which means that e2e1 = - e1e2, or more generally eiej = - ejej,.   Using 
this idea, canceling and collecting like terms to get (v1w2 – v2w1) e1e2. The signs of v 
and w determine the orientation of the vertices of the parallelogram being constructed: 
positive for clockwise, negative for counterclockwise as in Figure 8. (Browne, 2001, 
p.3).   
     To Grassmann the shape of the geometric figure being defined wasn’t important. 
The reason that a parallelogram is being used in this example is because of its 
simplicity. In order to generalize some of Grassmann’s ideas the example using a 
parallelogram can be used to discuss Grassmann’s  ideas without losing a sense of the 
geometric intuition.  Perhaps rounder shapes like the oval or ellipsoid would be more 
easily imagined when applying these ideas to tides, rather than a parallelogram or 
parallelepiped as shown in Figures 9 and 10 respectively.

ab                                                               ba 
Figure 9: Geometric interpretation of ba = -ab 
(Adopted from : Lengyel, 2012, Slide 21; Lundholm, 2009, figure 1.3) 
      Grassmann’s algebras make it relatively easy to go from lower dimensions to higher 
dimensions. To do this take the lower dimension and multiply it by the new element in 
a higher dimension as shown. In Figure 9 for a parallelepiped (Browne, 2001, p.3): 
 
(a)                                                          (b) 
Figure 10: abc 
(Adopted from Lengyel, 2012, Slide 24; Lundholm, 2009, figure 1.5) 
       Let P(v,w) be area of the parallelogram formed by a pair of vectors v and w. Then  
1.  Rescale each side by any ordinary real number, say, s and t then P(sv,tw) = st 
P(v,w) . This means that the area is rescaled by the same amount, for example 
s  t = t  s = st where s   v = v   s = sv. 

 
 
56
2. To reverse the orientation of the parallelogram, one of the sides of the 
parallelogram has to have its direction switched. This means P(w,v) = −P(v,w); 
reversing the sign reverses the direction. 
3. Non-commutative of exterior products is due to the fact that P(v,v) = 0. This 
means that vv = 0, for example let (v+w)  (v+w) = 0 solving this gives vv 
+ vw + wv + ww = vw + wv so that vw = -wv as in Figure 7.  
4. Adding or multiplying the vectors v and w does not affect the  area of the 
parallelogram P(v + aw,w) = P(v,w),  
5. The unit square is defined as one where P(e1, e2) = 1 
     (Lengyel, 2012, 11-12). 
     Another type of product that Grassmann discovered, but is rarely mentioned in most 
books, the ‘anti-wedge’ product written 𝑒1̅ ∨𝑒2̅ , this has the same properties as the 
exterior product but operates in a dual basis as ‘antivectors’ in an ‘antivector’ space. 
These represent an absence of geometry and behave by removing vectors. This means 
essentially that the ‘wedge’ is used to build up ‘grades’ the ‘anti-wedge’ is used to tear 
them down, or to reduce them. For example Let there be an n-dimensional Grassmann 
algebra.  In this algebra if s has a grade S and t has a grade T than s  t  has grade S + 
T for t, but for the anti-wedge  s v t = S + T – n (Lengyel, 2012, slides 60-62).   
    The cross product mentioned earlier is defined only in three dimensions, while the 
exterior product is defined in all dimensions. The overlap between the cross product 
and the exterior product in 3 dimensions can be seen by letting {e1, e2, e3} be a basis 
for the vector space. Define the exterior product of a pair of vectors u = u1e1 + u2e2+ 

 
 
57
u3e3 and v = v1e1 + v2e2+ v3e3. The exterior product can be calculated as uv = (u1v2 - 
u2v1) (e1e2) + (u1v3 – u3v1)( e1e3)+( u2v3 – u3v2)( e2e3), {e1  e2, e1  e3, e2  e3} 
form the basis for 2-forms on three-dimensional space. The components (u1v2 - u2v1), 
(u1v3 – u3v1), and ( u2v3 – u3v2) are the same components that are produced by doing the 
cross product u×v.  Let w = w1e1 + w2e2 + w3e3, be another vector where the exterior 
product of the 3 vectors can be calculated as follows:   
uvw= (u1v2w3 + u2v3w1+ u1v3w2 – u1v3w2 – u2v1w3 – u3v2w1) (e1e2e3)  
This coincides with the definition of the triple product. 
       The cross product and triple product have both geometric and algebraic meanings. 
The cross product u × v can be represented as a vector that is perpendicular to both u 
and v. These vectors determine the magnitude of the parallelogram.   Geometrically the 
triple product of u, v, and w is a volume of a parallelepiped. This is analogues to the 
parallelogram discussed above (Schulz, 2012, p.61, p.65). 
      This is one reason higher products of the cross product are not associative uvw 
uvw. The exterior product is defined in all dimensions and the cross product is 
only defined in 3-dimentions. 
       Today mathematics and physics occurs in multidimensional space. This has 
become the norm making Grassmann’s approach more viable today than when it was 
invented 150 years ago.

F. Clifford Algebras   
      Recall that the scalar product of 2 vectors is referred to as the dot product defined 
to be v ∙ u = |u||v|cosθ and the cross product u × v = |u||v|cosθ. From Grassmann the 
exterior or outer product was defined to be uv this has a has magnitude |u||v| sin θ. 
Grassmann’s  wedge product  is neither a scalar or a 
vector. It is what is called a ‘directed area’, or bivector. Also recall that the wedge 
product is antisymmetric, that is uv = −vu.  
       What Clifford did was to connect two seemingly unconnected ideas, namely uv = 
u∙v + u  v. This is called the geometric product and is analgous to the real and 
imaginary parts of a complex number.       
       Clifford also introduced two new products : u ∙ v = ½ (uv + vu) = v ∙ u and u  v 
= ½ (uv  vu) =  -v  u. Geometrically the product of two vectors is defined as 
being:  uv = u ∙ v + u    v, where the geometric product is both associative and 
distributive respectivally as: u(vw) = (uv)w = uvw and u(v+w) = uv+uw. Squaring 
the vectors produces a scalar: (u+v)2 = u2+v2+uv+vu (Gull, Lasenby, & Doran, 1993, 
pp.1178-1181).   
     To understand Clifford ststem two dimensions consider an orthonormal basis, vectors 
{e1,e2} that satisify the following relationships: 
e1 ∙ e1 = e2 ∙ e2=1 and e1 ∙ e2 = 0. 
e1  e1 = e2  e2=0 

 
 
59
So that 1 is a scalar,  {e1,e2} are vectors and e1e2 are bivectors. In order to form vector 
products use the definition uv = u∙v + u  v so that:  
Parellel vectors commute e12= e1 e1 = e1 ∙ e1 + e1  e1= 1 = e22,  
perpendicular ones do not:  e1 e2= e1 ∙ e2 + e1  e2= e1  e2 = -e2  e1= -e2 e1 and unit 
vectors have a negative square: (e2  e1)2=(e1 e2)(e1 e2) = e1 e2(-e2 e1) = -e1 e1= -1 (Gull, 
Lasenby, & Doran, 1993, pp. 1181-1182) 
     In order to extend the system in n-dimensions, the next object that needs to be defined 
are called ‘grades’. A scalar is considered to be 0-grade, a vector is a 1-grade, a bivector 
a 2-grade etc, where even-grade objects are referred to as being inhomogeneous. In 
general the outer product is an anti-symmetric geometric product of vectors that gives k-
blades, where k is any integer. (Hestenes, 2011 , p.249).  
     According to Clifford’s original paper The Classification of Geometric Algebras he 
let u and v be defined as scalars.  Clifford considered n-unit vectors e1, e2 , ..., en, where 
all (ej)2= 1  and ej ek = -ek ej  for  (j ≠ k), and every product consists of basic terms that 
are either of odd order ( ej, ej ek el, ... such that j ≠ k ≠ l ), or basic terms of  even order 
(1, ej ek , ... where j ≠ k ) . There can be no term higher than the nth order since “…we 
have altogether one term of order 0, n of order 1, ½ n (n -1) of order 2, ... one of order 
n; meaning 1 + n + ½ n (n -1) ... + n + 1 = 2n terms” (Clifford, 1876, p.400).  
     So far it has been shown how geometric algebras incorporate Grassmann’s algebras, 
but what about quaternions; In order to get back the quaternion set the following are 
applies: i = e2e3 , j = -e3e1  , k = e1e2, where i2 = j2 = k2= ijk = -1. 

 
 
60
(Lasenby, 2003, slide14-16) 
      Clifford found a way to take the best of quaternions and Grassmann algebras, 
incorporating them into one type of mathematics he called Geometric Algebra. In this 
section the author of this thesis has given a very basic mathematical discussion on how 
Clifford proposed to unify the worlds of Grassmann and Hamilton. This discussion did 
not do this subject the justice it deserves, but merely aided as a brief introduction to the 
subject.  
G. Lie Groups, Lie Algebras 
     Lie groups and Lie algebras are formally two different objects.  Lie himself thought 
of his work in terms of the infinitesimal group structures. Lie groups and algebras have 
grown into a deep and complex enterprise far too vast for the interests and scope of this 
dissertation. Rather than going into too many mathematical details the author will just 
briefly discuss some facts about the Lie groups and algebras of a few relevant non-
commutative rotation groups that are important to theoretical physics in this chapter. 
     Lie groups can be commutative or non-commutative. There are really only a few Lie 
groups that most physicists will encounter. The groups discussed here will be restricted 
to the ones that are related to quaternions, namely the ones that are non-commutative and 
complex, with the exception of SU(3) which is an octonion.  
     By definition the Lie group G is a continuous group of symmetries (Evans, 2013, 
p.7). Symmetries are very important in theoretical physics. The fact that they are 

 
 
61
continuous is also important. Continuous means that the manifold is ‘smooth’, and 
differentiable everywhere. This means that calculus can be done on a Lie group.  The 
maps 𝜌: (𝑥, 𝑦) ↦𝑥𝑦, 𝐺× 𝐺→𝐺 are ‘smooth’ and its inverse 𝜎: 𝑥↦𝑥−1, 𝐺→𝐺 is 
also ‘smooth’. Every Lie group can be associated with a Lie algebra through an 
exponential mapping (Evens, 2013, p.54).  
     A simple example of a Lie group is the circle SO(2). This is not a quaternion group 
but it will serve to illustrate what a rotation group is and what can be done with one. 
SO(2) exists in Euclidian space on the 2-dimentional plane. For example Figure 11 
depicts a system of symmetric rotations about the origin at angle θ. 
 
Where R(θ)e1 = e1 cos θ +e2 sin θ and R(θ)e2 = -e1 sin θ + e2 cos θ. Its rotation matrix 
can be written as: 
𝑅(𝜃)𝑒1𝑅(𝜃)𝑒2 = (𝑒1𝑒2) (cos 𝜃
−sin 𝜃
sin 𝜃
cos 𝜃) 
In general R(θ)ei = ej R(θ)ij ,  the rotation matrix is written  
Figure 11:

𝑅(𝜃) = (cos 𝜃

The rotation preserves the length of the vectors. This means that the length of the vector 
remains the same after the rotation (Tung, n.d., p.2).  
     Topologically SO(2) is a circle.  It is also abelian (commutative). 
 
     SO(2) forms the simplest  Lie group. SO(2) has one generator. This means that it is 
a Lie group of 1. It is a Lie group because all the properties of a Lie group can be 
defined on it, meaning it satisfies the definition of what a Lie group is: it has a group 
structure, it and its inverse are ‘smooth’ i.e. differentiable everywhere. SO(2) is also 
called a 1-sphere where when mapped to itself forms a double covering where 
μ:SO(2) SO(2) is defined by rθr2θ . This is illustrated in Figure 13 (Artin, 1991, 
p.277)

     Countless number of books have been written on this subject of Lie Groups. What 
will be given here is a very superficial way to define Lie groups, Lie algebras and how 
they are related to each other, without going into too many technical details. This is all 
that needs to be understood for now. 
H. Quaternions and Rotation Groups and their associated Lie groups. 
     There are a number of different rotation groups that show up in theoretical physics, 
amongst them are the unitary groups, special unitary groups and the special orthogonal 
groups. The two special unitary groups that are associated with quaternions are SU(2) 
and SU(3). SU(2) in physics these  are referered to as the Pauli matrices and SU(3) as 
the Gell-Mann matrices. The special orthogonal group of 3 x 3 matrices is SO(3),  and 
the special orthogonal group of 4 x 4 matrices is SO(4). These rotation groups are 
central to modern theoretical physics and mathematics. The adjective ‘special’ 
indicates that the determinant of the matrices in these groups is equal to +1. These 

 
 
64
groups form the backbone for many applications in physics from classical physics to 
string theory. Here the author will discuss how the rotation groups SU(2), SO(3), SU(3) 
and SO(4) are related to each other, to quaternions, and Lie groups. 
      Recall the quaternion rules:  i2 = j2 = k2 = -1,  ij = -ji = k , jk = -kj = i , ki = -ik =j .  
This means the quaternion group, Q = {-1, -i. –j, -k, 1, i, j, k}, is generated by 2 elements 
(Lang, 2002, p.9, p.723).  
     An interesting result that comes from the fact that quaternions are non-commutative 
is that polynomial equations over the quaternions can produce infinitely many quaternion 
solutions. Geometrically these infinitely many solutions form a two-dimensional sphere 
that is embedded in the ‘pure vector’ or ‘pure quaternion’ subspace. The sphere is 
centered at zero and intersects the complex planes at the antipodal points, i, j, k and – i, 
-j,-k respectively (Ballif, 2008, p5) .  For example let  H be the division ring of real 
quaternions, i, j, and k are each roots of the polynomial z2 + 1 = 0. From this, infinitely 
many conjugates that can be formed using, z = bi + cj + dk and letting b2 + c2 + d2 = 1. 
Each of these infinitely many conjugates of i is a root of x2 + 1. (Ballif, 2008, p.4)  
    Recall that complex numbers are points on the complex plane. This represents a 2-
dimentional space. One of the motivations behind quaternions was to develop a system 
that would generalize complex numbers in higher dimensions (Francis, 2011)  
i. 
The rotation group SU(2) and its associated Lie group and algebra 
     SU(2) is the group of all 2 x 2 unitary matrices with determinant 1. In general let a 
and b be two complex parameters where a matrix can be formed by a, b : 𝑀=

 
 
65
( 𝑎

𝑎∗)  ,where  |a|2 + |b|2 = 1 form the the group of unitary matricies with 
determinant 1. This is the group  SU(2) ('t Hooft, 2007, 33). This is what is referred to 
also as a ‘simple’ Lie group.  
     There doesn’t appear to be a uniform consensus about what constitutes a simple Lie 
group. What is clear is that a simple Lie group is different from the usual simple abstract 
group that is encountered in a college modern algebra course.  
 Proposition The longitudes of SU(2) are the conjugate subgroups QTQ* of subgroup T. 
(Artin, 1991, 275) 
     This can be understood pictorially by viewing SU(2) as a 3-sphere which shows a 
few of  the  latitudes and longitudes in SU(2) as shown in Figure 14.

  These matrices are called ‘anti-Hermitian’. If a matrix is Hermitian this means that the 
matrix is self-adjoint or that it is equal the transpose of its conjugate i.e. A=A* 
where   𝐴∗= (𝐴̅)𝑇= 𝐴𝑇
̅̅̅̅(Weisstein, , pgs.1357, 2650).  If it is anti-Hermitian this 
means that A= -A*. In physics A* is often written as A†, A dagger. These are related to 
the Pauli Matrices that are used in quantum mechanics. The Pauli spin matrices are: 
𝜎1 = (1
0
0
−1) , 𝜎2 = (0
1
1
0) , 𝜎3 = (0

0 ), 
     The Pauli matrices are Hermitian, σ †= σ, and are related to u1, u2, and u3 where  
u1 = i σ2, u2 = −i σ3 and u3 = i σ1. Furthermore they are also related to quaternions in the 
following way: Recall that quaternions are defined to be H = {q0 + q1i + q2 j + q3k| q0, 
q1, q2, q3 ∈ R} and i · j = −j · i = k, j · k = −k · j = i , k· i = −i ·k = j , i 2 = j 2 = k2 = −
1. Where i = iσ3, j = iσ2, k = iσ1 when represented as 2 x 2 matrices (Nakahara , 2003, 
xxii)  
     Quaternions are also isomorphic to Pauli matrices. One way to show this is by 
recalling that quaternions can be viewed as having a scalar (q0) and a vector (q) part. A 
quaternion can be represented as a 2 x 2 matrix in the following way: 
 Let 𝑄= [ 𝑞0, 𝒒 ] = 𝑞0𝜎0 −𝑖𝒒∙𝝈, 𝑤ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑒 𝒒∙𝝈∶= ∑
𝑞𝑎𝜎𝑎
3
𝑎=1
, where σ0 is the identity 
matrix, and σa for , a = 1,2,3, are the Pauli matrices σ1, σ2, and σ3 
        The product rule for the Pauli matrices can be written: 
𝜎𝑎𝜎𝑏= 𝛿𝑎𝑏𝜎0 + 𝑖𝜖𝑎𝑏𝑐𝜎𝑐  𝑤ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑒 𝑎, 𝑏, 𝑐= 1,2,3 

 
 
67
where δab is the Kronocker delta and εabc is the Levi-Civita symbol. The Levi-Civita 
symbol is anti-symmetric and εabc=1. The product rule can be written explicitly as 𝜎1
2 =
𝜎2
2 = 𝜎3
2 = 𝜎0 and 𝜎1𝜎2𝜎3 = 𝑖𝜎0, and are invariant under cyclic permutations of {1,2,3}.  
     Let the quaternion basis be {1, i, j, k} and let the real linear span of the Pauli matrices 
be {σ0,σ1σ2,σ2σ3,σ3σ1}, where σ0, σ1σ2, σ3σ1 form a closed multiplicative group so there is 
no need for complex coefficients and all the determinants are equal to 1. By mapping 
1 ↦𝜎0, 𝑖↦𝜎1𝜎2, 𝑗↦𝜎3𝜎1, 𝑘↦𝜎2𝜎3, this gives a way to describe Pauli matrices in 
terms of SU(2).  Unit quaternions are isomrphic to SU(2) making Pauli matrices and 
quatertnions isomorphic (Holms, 2013, pgs.19 -20; Goldstein, 1980, p.156). 
     SU(2) evolved from the unit quaternions. These structures are an essential part of the 
mathematical foundations of modern physics. In physics SU(2) = Spin (1), this means 
that the group is made up of all  1 x 1 quaternion matrices.  Their length, H = R4, is 
preserved under multiplication. In general unit quaternions that are related to SU(2) and 
Spin(1) as follows:  
𝑆𝑝𝑖𝑛(1) = {(𝑎+ 𝑖𝑑
−𝑏−𝑖𝑐
𝑏−𝑖𝑐
𝑎−𝑖𝑑)| 𝑎2 + 𝑏2 + 𝑐2 + 𝑑2 = 1} = 𝑆𝑈(2) 
(Savage, n.d. , p.24).  
ii. 
The rotation group SO(3) and its associated Lie group and algebra 
     Another important group that comes up is SO(3). This is the group of all     3 x 3 
orthogonal matrices with real elements. Each element is specified by 3 continuous 
parameters, and its determinant ≠1. Like SU(2), SO(3), is topologically compact, 
meaning they have the property of being  closed with 

 
 
68
bounded subsets of the real line (Royster, 1999). 
     To see how SO(3) works as a rotation group, let it be rotated by angle ϕ  about the 
direction n = (θ,ψ), where n is a unit vector, then Rn(ϕ) = R(ϕ,θ,ψ) where 0 ≤ θ ≤ π and 
0 ≤ ψ < 2π as in Figure 15 (Tung, 1985, p.96) 
 
           SO(3) represent the actions on a sphear. SO(3) in pure mathematical terms is 
called a doubly connected non-commutative  rotation group. (Tung, 1985, p.96); Gallier, 
2011, p.282). Groups that are simply-connected are characterized by the property that 
any closed loop is contractible. This means that the group SO(3) is not simply connected. 
This is due to the fact that it is doubly connected meaning that there are  two topological 
classes of loops on this structure which  depend on whether the net angle of rotation is 
an even or odd multiple of 2π. (Evans, 2013, p.1).  
     For example a torus is not simply connected. This means that there can be loops made 
on the torus that can be shrunk to a point without breaking it as in loop a and b in Figure 
14. These loops, a and b, can be shrunk to a point without breaking them, but loops c and 

 
 
69
d cannot be shrunk to a point without breaking the loop. This is because loops c and D 
include the torus’s central hole. 
 
 
     It turns out that there are also 2 types of closed curves on SO(3) (figure 16 see curves 
(a) and (b) ). A contractible curve is a curve that can be shrunk a point as shown in Figure 
16(a). This curve can be continuously deformed an even number of times. Curve (b) is 
closed and non-contractible. This means that it cannot be shrunk to a point, the two end 
points (P) on the line correspond to the same points on the manifold, meaning that the 
end points are fixed. This type of curve winds around the sphere an odd number of times. 
(Tung, 1985, p.97) 
 

 
 
70
     One of the reasons why the Lie group of SO(3) is so important to physics is that the 
basis of its Lie algebra is related to angular momentum: 
𝐽𝑥= (
0
0
0
0
0
−1
0
1
0
) , 𝐽𝑦= (

0
−1
0
0
) , 𝐽𝑧= (
0
−1
0
1
0
0
0
0
0
) 
These are also the generators of SO(3) (Costa & Fogli , 2012, 32). 
      In order to form the Lie algebra recall that what connects Lie groups to Lie algebras 
is the exponential matrix that was discussed in section D on Rodrigues' Rotation Formula. 
In general the exponential matrix is of the form 
𝑒𝐴= 𝐼+ ∑1
𝑘!
∞
𝑘=1
𝐴𝑘 
The exponential matrix of Jx, Jy, Jz can be written as rotation matrices as follows: 
𝑅1 = 𝑒−𝑖𝜃𝐽𝑥, 𝑅2 = 𝑒−𝑖𝜃𝐽𝑦, 𝑅3 = 𝑒−𝑖𝜃𝐽𝑧 
In general, a rotation through an angle θ in the direction n is written as 
𝑅= 𝑒−𝑖𝜃𝐽∙𝑛 
 (Kirillov, n.d. , p.35; Costa & Fogli , 2012, 32). 
     The two groups SO(3) , SU(2) are isomorphic to each other in the following way: 
𝑆𝑂(3) ≅𝑆𝑈(2)/{∓1}. This means that SU(2) is the ‘double cover’  of SO(3) as shown 
in Figure 17 (Savage, n.d. , p.16). This does not mean that they are the same.  This means 
that there exists a two-to-one, surjective (onto) homomorphism:  : SU(2) → SO(3) , ker 
 = Z2 = {±1} Where Z2 is the  fundamental group of SO(3). (Evans, 2013, p.4).   

 
 
71
     A fundamental group is an algebraic topology term where an algebraic space is 
formed from the loops in the space.  The paths in the space start and end at the same point 
as shown on the Torus in Figure 16 (Hatcher, 2001, 22).    
iii. 
The rotation group SU(3) and its associated Lie group and algebra 
      The rotation group SU(3) is  related to SU(2) in the following way: Where SU(2) is 
related to the quaternion rotation group, the elements of SU(3) are associated with 
octonions which are not only non-commutative, but also non-associative.  
      Since these groups are outside the main body of this thesis, these rotation groups are 
mentioned in passing here. They play a central role in particle physics. They are also 
called the Gell-Mann matrices after their founder Murray Gell-Mann who won the Nobel 
prize for particle classification using SU(3).  
     SU(3) is the group of all 3 x 3 unitary matrices with det = 0. The SU(3) matrices have 
8-dimentions They also have 8 linearly independent generators represented by the 
following matrices:  (Stover, n.d.)

These matrices were coined by Gell-Mann as the ‘8-fold way’. In particle physics they 
represent the Lie algebra. 

 
 
72
     These are essentially the Pauli matrices with an extra column of zeroes. They are often 
referred to as a generalization of the Pauli matrices and have similar properties.  
iv. 
 The rotation group SO(4) and its associated Lie group and algebra 
    Another group that is also important in physics and evolved from quaternions is 
SO(4). This is called the special orthogonal group in 4-dimensional space. This group 
is isomorphic to SU(2) x SU(2). This is the double cover of SO(4)  (Baez, 2001 , p.147). 
This means that the group isomorphism is: (𝑆𝑈(2) × 𝑆𝑈(2))/{∓1} ≅𝑆𝑂(4)  (Savage, 
n.d., p.21). This isomorphic relationship is a well-known theorem in representation 
theory. To show this remember that H = R4, where pairs of unit quaternions can be 
defined as (u,v) where  (𝐮, 𝐯) ∈𝐇 and Q ∈𝐇 since v-1 is a unit quaternion then 𝐯−1 ∈
𝑆𝑂(4)    so the action Q → uQv-1 preserves lengths of vectors and is linear in Q 
(Savage, n.d. , p.20).   
Theorem 2: The map 
                              φ:SU(2) x SU(2) → SO(4)  
                              where (v, w) → (Q → vQw-1) 
is a surjective (onto) group homomorphism with kernel {(1, 1) (-1, -1)}.■  
(Savage, n.d., p.21).  A group homomorphism is defined by mapping  
φ:G → H, if all u and v are elements of G than φ(u v) = φ(u) φ(v).  The group operation 
on the left is for G. The group operation on the right is for H. This means that the unit 
quaternion multiplication rotations of a 4-dimentional space act on both the left and 
right side for all quaternions. Therefore the homomorphism from SU(2) x SU(2) is onto 

 
 
73
the 4-dimensional rotation group SO(4), where it’s kernel is {(1, 1) (-1, -1)}. The fact 
that this homomorphism can be formed implies that SU(2) x SU(2) is a double cover on 
SO(4) (Baez, 2005 , p.232).            
     In this chapter the author has very briefly discussed some very rich and deep 
mathematical topics. In the following chapter both the historical and mathematical 
development will be discussed as it relates to physics, both classical and modern. The 
focus in the next chapter will be how quaternions and its relatives became so central to 
physics today.  
     It would be up to the reader, if interested, to go beyond the scope of this chapter and 
investigate the mathematics in more depth. There are many books and websites devoted 
to these topics as the author of this thesis has discovered.    
Chapter IV 
APPLICATIONS OF QUATERNIONS IN PHYSICS 
 
      So far the history and some of the mathematical ideas and structures that incorporate 
or are related to quaternions have been discussed. In this chapter the focus will be on how 
quaternions became assimilated into physics and how these ideas developed and became 
a part of every physics student’s experience without his or her realizing where these ideas 
came from. Although Hamilton had some ‘vague’ ideas about their possible applications 
to physics he never truly developed them.  
      The first person to truly apply quaternions to physics was Hamilton’s student Tait. 
Tait put quaternions through the test of applied mathematics in his 1867 book Elementary 
Treatise of Quaternions. Crowe said about this book “A noteworthy feature of Tait’s 

 
 
74
Treatise was the extensive attention that he gave (as Hamilton had not) to physical 
applications. ” (Crowe, 2002, p.10) 
     Quaternions after Tait and Maxwell took a ‘back seat’ in physics until Pauli and Dirac 
rediscovered them for quantum mechanics in the theory of spin. They have become even 
more deeply incorporated into theoretical physics through the application of Clifford 
algebras and complex non-commutative rotation groups. 
A. Tait and the Elementary Treatise of Quaternions 
      The fashion during the nineteenth century and the industrial revolution was to apply 
existing mathematics to give greater insight into the physics of the day. Here the author 
presents a collection of ideas and subjects that Tait discussed in his An Elementary 
Treatise of Quaternions. This is done in order to give the reader an insight into the use 
of quaternions in physics and some of the highlights of Tait’s seminal book. 
     In his preface to the second edition of Treatise, Tait discusses his relationship with 
Hamilton and Hamilton’s insistence that Tait apply quaternions to physics after the 
publication of the Elements. Tait writes that there is a lot in his own work that is 
unconnected to physics and attributes this to Hamilton himself.  He goes on to say that 
he had made considerable advances in applying quaternions to physics, but calls this part 
of the work essentially a collection of problems in which he “… managed (at least 
partially) to effect the application of Quaternions to line, surface, and  volume integrals, 
such as occur in Hydrokinetics, Electricity, and Potential generally” (Tait,1873, p.xi). He 

 
 
75
forecasts that his quaternion research   “…  is certain in time to be of incalculable value 
to physical science” (ibid, p.xi) 
     Quaternions were not initially motivated by physical problems. When Hamilton was 
investigating quaternions he was looking for a way to extend the complex plane, 
applications became an afterthought. Tait was the real trailblazer in applying quaternions 
to the physics problems of the day. He defines time and motion in the usual way. Since 
quaternions can express rotations, Tait starts by introducing quaternion applications to 
kinematics in Ch. X § 336 of the second edition of An Elementary Treatise on 
Quaternions (ibid, p.195). Tait devotes chapters X and XI to Physics, where X is devoted 
to Kinematics and XI is devoted to Other Physical Applications. The earlier chapters of 
the Treatise were devoted to purer mathematical concerns, techniques, propositions and 
proofs. 
     Browsing through the book it can be seen that the mathematical concerns are mainly 
geometric and these precede the more analytic interests. Tait says, “Keeping always in 
view, as the great end of every mathematical method, the physical applications, I have 
endeavored to treat the subject as much as possible from a geometrical instead of an 
analytical point of view.” (ibid, p.vii) 
      By the third edition of the Treatise he adds Chapter IX. Surfaces of The Second 
Degree, and rearranges various topics. He enlarges the Treatise to include more physics 
applications then the previous editions (Tait ,1890, p.v).   He starts the new chapter on 
Kinematics, now Chapter XI, connecting quaternions to physics. He claims that the 

 
 
76
topics he “…selected for treatment will be those of most direct interest in their physical 
applications.” (Tait,1890, p.279).  
      In 1896, Arthur S. Hathaway, Professor of Mathematics In The Rose Polytechnic 
Institute, Terre Haute, Indiana, in his A Primer of Quaternions (Hathaway, 1896, p.iii)   
says in his introduction that The Elements of Quaternions by Tait “is the accepted text-
book for advanced students.” (Hathaway, 1896, p.iii)   
i. 
Kinematics and Rigid body motion    
     One of the most obvious ways to incorporate quaternions into classical physics is 
through mechanics. Many of Tait’s results here would be familiar to today’s physics 
student and more easily obtained using modern vector analysis.  According to Tait “All 
that is contemplated is to treat a few branches of the subject in such a way as to shew the 
student how to apply the processes of Quaternions.”(Tait, 1890, 279). 
      One of the most obvious issues for today’s student when trying to work through Tait’s 
derivations is the language. He starts out looking at the Kinematics of a Point in Section 
354. Here he introduces the definitions of velocity and acceleration, which are defined in 
the usual way, 𝑣=
𝑑𝜌
𝑑𝑡,  
𝑎=
𝑑2𝜌
𝑑𝑡2  , where ρ is the point vector. From these definitions he uses quaternions to 
discuss uniform circular motion.  
     Tait then goes on to discuss the motion of a point in a plane curve using the usual 
'polar coordinates’, r and θ (Tait, 1890, 280). His approach differs in some respects from 
the modern method of Gibbs and Heaviside, which most physics students encounter in 

 
 
77
text books.  What these two methods have in common is the idea that a vector can be 
manipulated according to algebraic rules, without writing out all its components in a 
fixed coordinate system. Tait's work preceded Gibbs and Heaviside. Thus Tait was the 
first to apply this principle to problems of kinematics, making his work truly 
groundbreaking. 
     In Tait's method every symbol represents a quaternion. All these can be freely added 
and multiplied according to the usual quaternion rules.  Those quaternions that do not 
have a vector part are called ‘scalars’, which if they are positive are referred to as ‘pure 
magnitudes’. The quaternion part that does not have a scalar he calls a ‘vector’. A unit 
vector (one with magnitude 1) has as its square -1. Any vector is uniquely the product of 
a pure magnitude and a unit vector.     
     Tait writes the vector that represents the position of the particle at time t as 
ρ=ρ(t)=r(t)ζ(t)…………… (1) 
where r and ζ are the magnitude and unit vector factors of ρ. (here making 
slight changes to Tait’s notation.) He defines two constant unit vectors α and β 
where 
β = ρ(0)……………………….. (2) 
is the initial direction of motion in the plane, and α is perpendicular to the 
plane. Thus the quaternion αβ is a unit vector perpendicular to β. He chooses 
the sign of α so that β, αβ, α form a right-handed coordinate system 
and therefore 
𝜍(𝑡) = 𝛽𝑐𝑜𝑠𝜃(𝑡) + 𝛼𝛽𝑠𝑖𝑛𝜃(𝑡) = (𝑐𝑜𝑠𝜃(𝑡) + 𝛼𝑠𝑖𝑛𝜃(𝑡))𝛽…. (3) 

 
 
78
Observe that α, being a unit vector, satisfies α2 = -1. This is a property of quaternions not 
shared by Gibbs and Heaviside.  Because of it  satisfies Euler's equation: 
𝑐𝑜𝑠𝜃(𝑡) + 𝛼𝑠𝑖𝑛𝜃(𝑡) = 𝑒𝛼𝜃(𝑡)………………………………… (4) 
Combining (3) with (4), to get 
𝜍̇ = 𝜃̇𝛼𝜍 …………………………………………………………..(5) 
Now one differentiates (1) by the product rule using ζ to get: 
𝜌̇ = 𝑟̇𝜍+ 𝑟𝜍̇ = 𝑟̇𝜍+ 𝑟𝜃̇𝛼𝜍……………………………………….(6) 
  
In this exercise Tait is really looking for the formula for acceleration 
𝜌̈ = (𝑟̈𝜍+ 𝑟̇𝜍̇) + (𝑟̇𝜃̇𝛼𝜍+ 𝑟𝜃̈𝛼𝜍+ 𝑟𝜃̇𝛼𝜍̇) = 𝑟̈𝜍+ 2𝑟̇𝜃̇𝛼𝜍+ 𝑟𝜃̈𝛼𝜍+ 𝑟𝜃̇ 2𝛼2𝜍 (7) 
Again using α2 = -1, and collecting terms in ζ and αζ, one gets 
𝜌̈ = (𝑟̈ −𝑟𝜃̇ 2)𝜍+ (2𝑟̇𝜃̇ + 𝑟𝜃̈)𝛼𝜍 ……………………………..(8) 
where the term −𝑟𝜃2̇  is the centripetal acceleration of a point traveling uniformly in a 
circle, and 2𝑟̇𝜃̇𝛼𝜍 is the Coriolis term. (1) can also be used to identify ζ with ρ/r or what 
in modern notation is called 𝜌̂. 
     This is something that can only be done using quaternions. It can’t be done in quite 
this way using modern vectors, nor can Euler’s formula (4) be applied to perpendicular 
planes. (4) was precisely what Hamilton was looking for, an analogy to Euler’s formula 
in 3-dimensions. Tait took this idea that is unique to quaternions and applied it to physics 
problems without the use of coordinates or modern vectors.  

 
 
79
     Tait continues on in the Treatise in a similar way through rigid body motion. Here 
Tait refines an earlier paper on rigid body motion (Tait, 1869, pp.261 – 303). He 
continues to develop quaternion applications of rigid body motion in the second and third 
edition of the Treatise. He calls part B of the Kinematics chapter –Kinematics of a Rigid 
System. Tait develops this more clearly in the third edition than the second edition, 
selecting problems that appeal to him and solving those using quaternions (Tait, 1873, 
pp.202-218; Tait, 1890, pp.287-308).   Quaternions was a new way to do some old 
problems without the tedium of fixed coordinates. He did this before modern vector 
analysis was invented. 
     Although Tait does continue to give physics examples he stresses in the introduction 
of Chapter XII in the third edition (XI in the second edition) “This Chapter is not intended 
to teach Physics, but merely to shew by a few examples how expressly and naturally 
quaternions seem to be fitted for attacking the problems it presents.” (Tait , 1873, 
p.222;Tait, 1890, p.309 ) Here again Tait uses rigid body motion to illustrate the power 
of quaternions when applied to actual physical situations. A nice little problem in section 
427 is where Tait uses quaternions to derive the equation of motion of a simple 
pendulum, taking into account the Earth’s rotation (Tait, 1890, p.336). In practice, 
quaternions are useful in representing rotation orientations. This is how they are still used 
today, although this particular problem would be solved using modern vector analysis. 
Here there is no real need to employ quaternions explicitly, so vectors as they are used 
today appear to be adequate.   

 
 
80
     A. McCaulay discusses Tait’s quaternion applications to elasticity in his 1893 book 
Utility Of Quaternions In Physics, Section III.1. He says,  
“As far as I am aware the only author who has applied Quaternions to Elasticity is 
Prof. Tait. In the chapter on Kinematics of his treatise on Quaternions, §§ 360–
371, he has considered the mathematics of strain with some elaboration and again 
in the chapter on Physical Applications, §§ 487–491, he has done the same with 
stress and also its expression in terms of the displacement at every point of an 
elastic body.” (McCaulay, 1893, p.11) 
 
     Thus it appears Tait was the first person to truly apply quaternions to physical 
problems. Problems that today would be worked out with the vectors of Gibbs and 
Heaviside were originally worked out by Tait. The brilliance of what Tait did was to 
work out a system where problems can be set up without using coordinates. Before Tait 
these problems would rely on tedious calculations using coordinates to solve them. For 
most problems the modifications of Gibbs and Heaviside  is fine, and if everything can 
be done using vectors there isn’t a problem, but sometimes quaternions will get you 
there faster, as in the example of a particle in a moving system mentioned earlier. It is 
not that the problem cannot be done using other methods, it is that in some cases with 
quaternions the result can be deduced more quickly, but at the price of being more 
difficult to set up. Tait was a ‘purist’ when it came to quaternions and perhaps didn’t 
like Gibbs and Heaviside modifying them to fit their needs at the time. This 
misunderstanding was unfortunate since both systems could have learned and grown 
from each other.     
 
 

 
 
81
ii. Electricity and Magnetism 
     Tait first explores the applications of quaternions to electricity and magnetism in 
example 428 of the second edition the Treatise. Here Tait sets up the following situation 
“As another example we take the case of the action of electric currents on one another or 
on magnets; and the mutual action of permanent magnets.” (Tait, 1873, p.249).  Tait uses 
some well-known examples from Ampère and Murphy to test the usefulness of applying 
quaternions to various known problems. In the 1890 edition the Treatise he repeats many 
of the same problems he did in 1873, but in the newer edition he extends Physical 
Applications part   E. Electrodynamics giving more examples the he did in his previous 
edition. Most of these examples can be more easily derived using vectors as is done 
today.  
iii. The operator “del”, and the Laplacian 
      Hamilton used quaternions to define the del operator ∇= 𝑖
𝜕
𝜕𝑥+ 𝑗
𝜕
𝜕𝑦+ 𝑘
𝜕
𝜕𝑧 . This is 
still used today in mathematics and physics. It is a symbol that every physics student 
would recognize from their electricity and magnetism courses, and every math major 
from their advanced calculus courses. With the del operator only the vector parts, i, j, 
k, of the quaternions are used.  
     Young Sam Kim in his 2003 thesis on Maxwell's Equations and a Historical Study of 
Incorporating Them into Undergraduate Mathematics and Engineering Education (Kim, 
2003, p.88) discusses the influence that quaternions had on Maxwell, especially in the 
application of the operator ‘del’() and the operator 2.  Tait brings up ‘del’ for the first 

 
 
82
time on page 76 of the second edition of the Treatise (Tait, 1873, p.76). Tait credits the 
‘del’ to Hamilton calling this “the very singular operator devised by Hamilton” (Tait, 
1873, p.173).  He first applied this operator to a physical situation when he discussed an 
example in Kinematics “…it may be interesting here, especially for the consideration of 
any continuous displacements of the particles of a mass, to introduce another of the 
extraordinary instruments of analysis which Hamilton had invented” (Tait, 1873, p.215) 
he goes on to let - represent the direction and size of the force at any point he then writes 
the operator  
∇= 𝑖𝑑
𝑑𝑥+ 𝑗𝑑
𝑑𝑦+ 𝑘𝑑
𝑑𝑧 
Using the observation that he discussed in exercise 317 where if =F then  
∇ν = ∇2𝐹= −( 𝑑2
𝑑𝑥2 + 𝑑2
𝑑𝑦2 + 𝑑2
𝑑𝑧2). 
     In the next exercise he shows  “…the effect of the vector operation , upon any scalar 
function of the vector of a point, is to produce the vector which represents in magnitude 
and direction the most rapid change in the value of the function”(Tait, 1873, p.216) 
     By the time the third edition is published the application of quaternions to 
electromagnetic theory is neither small nor trivial as Kim also observed in his thesis  
“…Tait’s major emphasis in Quaternions was in the area of physical applications, 
and that is also the area where Quaternions attracted the attention of scientists and 
applied mathematicians who were interested in electromagnetic theory. That in 
turn led to the creation of a new system of vector analysis derived from the vast 
structure of Quaternions suitable for their needs in their perspective of the universe 
in the late nineteenth century.” (Kim, 2003, p.89) 
 

 
 
83
    Tait’s   second edition (1873) of the Treatise he devoted twenty sections to 
Electrodynamics - §§428-448 (Tait, 1873, pp.249-260) , by the time the third edition was 
published Tait devoted not only part E- Electrodynamics. §§ 453-472, but also added 
parts F- General Expressions for the Action between Linear Elements, §473, G- 
Application of  to certain Physical Analogies ,  §§474 – 478, H. Elementary Properties 
of .§§ 479 – 481, and K- Application of the  Integrals to Magnetic &c. Problems 
§§502 – 506 (Tait, 1890, pp.350-374, pp.387-390). This indicates that his interest in 
applying quaternions to electromagnetic theory became more intense in time. This may, 
in part, be because he recruited his former classmate, James Clark Maxwell, into the 
quaternion enterprise, thereby enticing Maxwell to apply quaternions to his own 
electromagnetic theory.  
 
B. Maxwell and Quaternions 
      In 1864 Maxwell had worked out the equations for electromagnetism, in his paper A 
Dynamical Theory of the Electromagnetic Field dated 27 October 1864. Before Maxwell 
used quaternions in his electromagnetic theory he had used complex numbers and 
coordinates as his mathematical tools.  (Maxwell, 1865, pp.467–512) He originally wrote 
eight equations for electromagnetic fields similar to those in Table 3.

(Equations adopted from Waser, 2000, p.2)  
     Maxwell viewed current flow as analogous to fluid flow. Thinking in terms of 
mechanical analogies was the tradition of the times.  
     He discusses in this paper how electricity flows in an ether where “…from the 
phenomena of light and heat, that there is an aethereal medium filling space and 
permeating bodies, capable of being, set in motion and of transmitting that motion from 
one part to another, and of communicating that motion to gross matter so as to heat it and 
affect it in various ways.” (Maxwell, 1864, p.460). 
       The way that Maxwell initially developed his equations is different than the way that 
most textbooks write them (Table 3). Today Maxwell equations are usually written as 
(6)-Ohm’s law,   (4)-The Faraday-force and (8)-The continuity equation for a changing 
region. (Waser, 2000, p.3) 
     Tait and Maxwell knew each other from school and College.  They remained friendly 
until Maxwell’s death in 1879. It was probably due to Tait’s persuasion that Maxwell 
decided to incorporate quaternions into his work.  
       At this time Maxwell became interested in quaternions, and perhaps liked the idea 
of using them. According to Waser Maxwell did not actually calculate with quaternions 

 
 
86
(Waser, 2000, p.3). Maxwell wrote a Manuscript on the Application of Quaternions to 
Electromagnetism  in November 1870. At about the same time he wrote about the general 
use of quaternions in a letter to Tait:  
"... The invention of the Calculus of Quaternions by Hamilton is a step towards the 
knowledge of quantities related to space which can only be compared for its 
importance with the invention of triple coordinates by Descartes. The limited use 
which has up to the present time been made of Quaternions must be attributed 
partly to the repugnance of most mature minds to new methods involving the 
expenditure of thought ..." 
 
 (Maxwell, 1995, p.570). It is evident that during this time Maxwell was enthusiastic 
about quaternions, but setting up a physics problem using quaternions was often clumsy 
and tedious. 
     Cayley, another prominent mathematician at the time remarked that quaternions were 
analogous to “‘pocket maps’, concise and compact, but not as easy to read as full scale 
coordinate maps” (Macfarlane, 1916, p.41). It appears that what Cayley meant by this is 
that quaternions contained a great amount of information in relatively few symbols, but 
in order to access all the information that may lay hidden in some problems, full scaled 
Cartesian coordinate should be used in certain types of calculations (Pritchard, 1998, 
p.236).  Tait wrote to Cayley in August 28. 1888 that “…no problem or subject is a fit 
one for the introduction of Quaternions if it necessitates the introduction of Cartesian 
Machinery” (Knott, 1898, p.159) To Tait it appears that there were certain parts of 
mathematics that did not lend themselves to quaternions if the use of Cartesian 
coordinates had to be employed.   

 
 
87
     By the 1873 edition of the Treatise, Maxwell included quaternions. He essentially 
modified the original equations that he used in his 1865 edition of the Treatise into the 
new edition. Whether Maxwell actually calculated with quaternions is debatable. 
Maxwell probably used what he found convenient for his needs, without ‘ruffling too 
many feathers’. This would make sense, for example, according to Waser, Maxwell 
defined the field vectors; B = B1i + B2j + B3k. Here Maxwell used quaternions notation 
without scalar part. According to Waser there are other instances where Maxwell uses 
the scalar part of quaternions without vector part (Waser, 2000, p.3). 
     As for gradient, divergence, curl, and the Laplacian, these terms, which that most 
students of physics are familiar with, were not Maxwell’s original terms for these objects. 
Maxwell was aware of the Laplacian as it is understood today. He derived what is known 
today as gradient, divergence, curl, from this.  Maxwell called the scalar part S del σ and 
the vector part V del σ, where σ is a vector function of position. He called the scalar part 
the convergence, the negative of what is called today divergence, and the vector part curl 
(Maxwell, 1890, p.264).  Maxwell illustrated his definitions in his paper On the 
Mathematical classification of Physical Quantities as follows:  
Figure 18 – Maxwell’s diagrams (adopted from: Maxwell, 1890, p.265). 
 
     
 
 
Convergence                           Curl                      Convergence and Curl 

 
 
88
      Maxwell went through some struggles when naming these quantities. He called what 
today is called divergence, convergence; gradient, slope; and initially he called curl by 
other names such as twirl, but finally settled on curl. As Maxwell described his struggle 
with these words “I have sought for a word which shall neither, like Rotation, Whirl, or 
Twirl, connote motion, nor, like Twist, indicate a helical or screw structure which is not 
of the nature of a vector at all.” (Maxwell, 1890, p.265).  
     Quaternions was not the best way to express Maxwell’s equations due to its awkward 
notation. Maxwell did not deviate far from the notation used in his previous edition. Here 
is where Gibbs and Heaviside improved upon what Maxwell presented.  They made 
Maxwell’s equations more accessible than how they were written in the 1873 edition A 
Treatise on Electricity & Magnetism that both Gibbs and Heaviside read (Wilson, 1901).  
     In order to derive Maxwell’s equations to correspond to the ones that students 
encounter in their physics books it is more convenient to start from his original 1865 set 
of equations, before he incorporated quaternions into his work, as was done in Table 3. 
     After some reworking these can be represented in a form that most undergraduate and 
graduate students would recognize as Maxwell’s equations, for example in David J. 
Griffiths Introduction to Electrodynamics or John David Jackson’s Classical 
Electrodynamics. 
     In this chapter so far the application of quaternions was developed and applied to 
classical physics. Hamilton’s student Tait really set quaternions on their way to become 
an integral part of physics.  Even Maxwell, at least for a while, developed his 
electromagnetic equations using quaternions. 

 
 
89
C. Quaternions and Special Relativity Theory 
     Hamilton wrote a letter to Graves in 1837, which has almost a prophetic ring.  He 
asked “…what special connexion has the number Four with mathematics generally…?” 
and answered 
“One general form of answer to this question is the following: 
that in the mathematical quaternion is involved a peculiar synthesis, or 
combination, of the conceptions of space and time …Time is said to have only one 
dimension, and space to have three dimentions former is an … The mathematical 
quaternion partakes of both these elements; in technical language it may be said to 
be "time plus space", or "space plus time": and in this sense it has, or at least 
involves a reference to, four dimensions. And how the One of Time, of Space the 
Three, Might in the Chain of Symbols girdled be." (Graves, 1889, p.635)  
 
    One of the quaternion advocates during this time was Macfarlane who in 1891 
formulated a space-time in terms of quaternions using a modified version of quaternion 
multiplication he called ‘hyperbolic quaternions’ (Macfarlane , 1894).  The Hyperbolic 
quaternion multiplication table can be written as follows (Table 4): 
 
  
 
Table 4-Hyperbolic quaternion multiplication table  
(Adopted from Hyperbolic Quaternion , n.d. ) 
Hyperbolic quaternions, unlike Hamilton’s quaternions that were not only non-
commutative, they are also non-associative, (ij)j = kj = -i  and i(jj) = i. This was 
algebraically problematic. Macfarlane in his 1900 paper Hyperbolic Quaternions was

able to restore the associative property of multiplication by resorting to using 
biquaternions (Macfarlane, 1900b).  
     In his paper Hyperbolic Quaternions on page 179 he writes about figure 7 shown on 
page 181 that “Just as a spherical vector is expressed by r√-1 ξ, so a hyperbolic vector is 
expressed by rξ, where r denotes the modulus and ξ the axis” (Macfarlane, 1900b, 179). 
This essentially the same understanding that Poincaré later had with respect to the space 
being a hyperbolic rotation and time as the imaginary coordinate.  (Poincaré, 1906). 
Macfarlane’s diagram 7 (Figure 17) is essentially the same as what is called the 
Minkowski space today. Macfarlane shows in his figure 7 (Figure 19) the properties of 
space-time used in special relativity today. Macfarlane came before Minkowski and 
special relativity, but is often overlooked in its history, as one of the first to lay the 
foundations to special relativity theory and space-time using hyperbolic quaternions. 
Macfarlane thus opened to discussions about linear algebra, vector analysis, differential 
geometry and relativity theory (Macfarlane, 2010)

represent ‘sheets’ similar to Minokwski 
space.

91
Arthur W. Conway in his 1911 article On the Application of Quaternions to some Recent 
Developments of Electrical Theory, published in Proceedings of The Royal Irish 
Academy was one of the first people to see the connection between quaternions and 
special relativity. A year later Ludwik Silberstein independently recognized this 
connection, which he published in Philosophical Magazine, Quaternionic Form of 
Relativity. Following Silberstein’s article Conway comments, focusing on his own 
priority in this discovery:  
“The appearance of Prof. Silberstein’s paper entitled “The Quaternionic Form of 
Relativity” in the May issue of the Phil. Mag. is a welcome sign that continental 
mathematicians, who have already largely availed themselves of various systems 
of vector notation, are perhaps awakening to the suitability of quaternions in such 
a connexion…”. Making reference to his own paper Conway continues “An 
application of quaternions to the Relativity Principle will be found in a paper, vol. 
xxix. Section A, No. 1, Proc. Irish Academy (read Feb. 1911).” (Silberstein, 1912, 
p.208).  
 
     Conway goes on to discuss the asymmetric advantages that quaternions have to offer 
the theory of special relativity, since nature is not symmetric with respect to space and 
time. Unfortunately the author of this thesis was unable to find in either Silberstein or 
Conway’s work any reference to Macfarlane and his insights into the ideas discussed 
using hyperbolic quaternions. 
i. 
Quaternions and Lorentz transformations 
       Special relativity was introduced into the scientific community by Albert Einstein in 
1905. According to Dr. Martin Erik Horn, who is part of the Institute of Physics 
Education in Goethe University Frankfurt am Main in Germany, Einstein became 
familiar with quaternions and applied them to Lorentz transformations many years after 

 
 
92
he originally introduced special relativity to the world (Einstein, 1932). As to Einstein’s 
1932 article being used for an introductory physics course, Horn says that “… their 
general representation is so abstract that an introduction at this level seems hopeless. The 
fundamental associations however can be reduced to a point didactically so that they can 
be instituted at the introductory level.” (Horn, 2002, p.3).  
      Although it is not clear to the author of this thesis how Einstein specifically 
incorporated quaternions into his theory of special relativity one can observe the theory 
of special relativity takes place in 4-dimensions: three space dimensions and one time 
dimension. It is due to this three space one time relationship that Lorenz transformations 
became so important in Einstein’s theory of special relativity.  By definition the Lorentz 
group is the set of all the Lorentz transformations that form in a Euclidean four-space. 
The Lorentz group conserves the quantity c2t2 – x12 – x22 – x32 where c = constant speed 
of light.  
     An interesting historical fact is that George Francis FitzGerald was an independent 
discoverer of what are usually called Lorentz contractions. In Science 1889 he wrote in 
a short letter about the Michelson and Morley's experiment:  
I have read with much interest Messrs Michelson and Morley’s wonderfully 
delicate experiment attempting to decide the important question as to how far the 
ether is carried along by the Earth. Their result seems opposed to other experiments 
showing that the ether in the air can be carried along only to an inappreciable 
extent. I would suggest that almost the only hypothesis that could reconcile this 
opposition is that the lengths of material bodies changes, according as they are 
moving through the ether or across it, by an amount depending on the square of the 
ratio of their velocities to that of light.(FitzGerald, 1889, p.390)   
 

 
 
93
Although FitzGerald didn’t use the word ‘contraction’ or another synonym, the idea of 
‘contraction’ is implied (Browne, n.d.). Thus it appears that FitzGerald was the first to 
conceive of the idea of contraction. But it was Macfarlane who showed this 
mathematically using hyperbolic quaternions. In his understanding about the operator 
products of hyperbolic quaternions he found that 𝑒𝑎𝑟𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑟= (𝑢+ 𝑣𝑟)𝑒2𝑎𝑟+
𝑤(cosh 2𝑎)𝑠  the implication of this formula is that a stretch of cosh2a in any direction 
perpendicular to r implies that the untransformed space experiences a contraction relative 
to the stretch of cosh2a. Macfarlane’s work in the 3-dimensional hyperboloid model 
reflects many of the notions that come up in space-time. Where for example a point on 
the hyperboloid “…represents a frame of reference having a particular velocity with 
respect to the waiting frame which corresponds to the point 1 + 0i + 0j + 0k” (Macfarlane, 
2010). Thus it was Macfarlane who first worked out the same transformations that 
Lorentz did, but without the physical connections. 
ii.   Clifford algebras and Lorentz Transformation  
     Clifford algebras have been more successfully applied to Relativity theory than some 
other mathematical tools have. Hestenes in his famous book Space-Time Algebra written 
in 1966 made the connection between Clifford’s Algebra and the Theory of Special 
Relativity and Quantum Theory. Hestenes was one of the first to apply Clifford algebras 
rigorously to special relativity theory. (Hestenes, 1986, p.1). He called this new subject 
STA (Space-Time algebra). In his lecture notes Baylis writes that “Much of the power of 
Clifford’s geometric algebra in relativistic applications arises from the form of Lorentz 

 
 
94
transformations.” (Baylis, 2004, p.91). Here the Minkowski metric is put directly in 
Clifford algebra form,  Cℓ1,3 = Cℓ3,1 representing the 3-space and  
1-time dimensions of space-time. In order to generate the basis of Cℓ1,3  the results of the 
basis vectors γμ are used, where μ = 0, 1, 2, 3. These satisfy the relation: 
1
2 (𝛾𝜇𝛾𝜈+ 𝛾𝜈𝛾𝜇) = 𝜂𝜇𝜈= {
1, 𝜇= 𝜈= 0
−1, 𝜇= 𝜈= 1,2,3 
0, 𝜇≠𝜈
 
(Baylis, 2004, p.94) 
     STA has its own specialized language as noted by ‘ Cℓ1,3’. To develop the 
mathematical-physics, and all the associated definations further would go beyond the 
scope of this thesis. 
D. Quaternions and Quantum Mechanics 
       Pauli matrices, named after Wolfgang Pauli, were discussed in Chapter III section 
H.i as fundamentally being quaternions. In an interesting quote from Feynman:   
“Take Hamilton’s quaternions: the physicists threw away most of this very 
powerful mathematical system, and kept the part – the mathematically trivial part 
- that became vector analysis. But when the whole power of quaternions was 
needed, for quantum mechanics, Pauli re-invented the system I n a new form. 
Now, you can look back and say that Pauli’s spin matrices and operators were 
nothing but Hamilton’s quaternions” (Feynman, 1999, pp.200-201)   
 
     It was discussed earlier that Pauli matrices are isomorphic to quaternions but they are 
not exactly the same thing. To make them identical they must be multiplied by the 
complex unit i. Also Pauli matrices do not form a division algebra, since an inverse 
cannot be formed, thus they are not ‘true quaternions’ (Baez,1997).

i. 
Spinors  
     By the time Einstein wrote Special Relativity vector analysis was well established 
within the physics community. Quaternions applied to relativity theory, as such, were 
largely ignored by the scientific establishment except by a few, as mentioned earlier.      
      It was the Austrian-Swiss physicist, Wolfgang Pauli, who introduced spin matrices 
to quantum mechanics. It was through his work that quaternions really made a comeback 
(Edmonds, 1972, pp. 205; Lambek, 1995).       
     Dr. David Hestenes, the same one who made the connection between special 
relativity, quantum mechanics and Clifford algebras, points out 
   “… quaternions have been popping up in quantum mechanics for a long time, 
but often are disguised as matrices, spinors etc. so they were not recognized as 
quaternions, but conceptually these objects, despite notational changes, and 
perhaps improvements, are still related to the original ideas of quaternions as 
Hamilton originally envisioned.” (Hestenes, 2007) 
 
       
ii. 
The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle 
     One of the most important relationships in quantum mechanics is the Heisenberg 
Uncertainty Principle. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle says that when two 
quantum mechanical operators do not commute that the more precisely an observable is 
measured the less precise another observable can be measured. Thus two observables 
cannot be measured simultaneously to arbitrary precision. By observables what is meant 
is something that can be measured. Any attempt to do so will yield results more or less 
uncertain for each observable in the system. The best that can be done is to minimize the 

 
 
96
product of the two uncertainties, the minimum being approximately related to the degree 
of noncommutation (the commutator) of the two operators (Stack, 2013, pgs. 3-5). 
      In physics the usual examples that are given of two observables and how they are 
related by the uncertainty principle are:  
(i) 
any component of position and the corresponding component of momentum; 
and  
(ii) 
any two components of the classically defined angular momentum r x p. 
     Many of the familiar elementary particles (electron, proton, neutron, neutrino, quark, 
and many others) have spin ½. This means that the particle has an intrinsic angular 
momentum that must be added to r x p. This must be done in order to maintain the 
conservation of angular momentum.  The operators’ sx, sy, sz correspond to the x, y, z 
components of the spin angular momentum. These are represented by the Pauli matrices 
multiplied by ½.  These matrices have commutation relations resembling those of the 
three components of r x p. This is so that uncertainty principle applies smoothly to the 
whole angular momentum, as well as to the internal and external parts separately 
(Dorney, 2011). 
     This principle says if one measures physical information (position or momentum) 
about the x-axis for sx, all the physical information about the other two, sy and sz, will be 
lost. This is partly true of the spin along some intermediate axis, say at an angle between 
x and z. Thus non-commutative here means physically that spin cannot simultaneously 
be measured in more than one direction. (Mitteldorf, 2001).       

 
 
97
     At the same time, the Pauli matrices are 2 x 2, so that each spin operator, say sz, has 
just two eigenstates. These eigenstates are commonly referred to as spin up and spin 
down, and have eigenvalues +½ and -½. For example if it is determined that sz = + ½ , 
then the value of sx becomes completely undecided between +½ and -½. The interplay 
between the three orthogonal spin operators the two eigenstates is an outgrowth of the 
near-isomorphism of SU(2) to SO(3) discussed at the end of Chapter III section H.ii 
E. Quaternions in Particle Physics 
i. 
Isospin 
       By the mid-twentieth century particle physics was all the rage. New particles were 
being discovered constantly; a way to classify them was needed. The structures that 
ultimately developed grew out of the idea of isospin was introduced as early as 1932. 
Isospin was introduced by Werner Heisenberg, the same Heisenberg who is connected 
with the Uncertainty Principle. Isospin, like spin angular momentum, is based on the 
group SU(2) and can therefore be considered as an application of quaternions to particle 
physics. 
     In the early 1920's the proton and electron were known, and the electric charge of the 
atomic nucleus could be accounted for by supposing it to contain a certain number of 
protons. But there was a problem, this number of protons fell a good deal short of 
accounting for the measured atomic mass. So ideas floated around to account for the 
discrepancy in the atomic mass; for example if there were additional protons in the 

 
 
98
nucleus, there would have to be electrons to cancel their charge, but it seemed unlikely 
that electrons could be bound so tightly in the atom in order to do this.   
      It was discovered in 1930 by Herbert Becker and Walter Bothe that non-ionizing 
radiation was produced when alpha particles were sent against beryllium. Finally James 
Chadwick showed in 1932 that in the experiment done by Becker and Bothe really did 
involve the emission of uncharged particles with mass very close to that of the proton. 
These particles became known as neutrons. Thus by adding a suitable number of these 
neutrons to the protons in the nucleus, the atomic masses could be explained (Chadwick, 
1935).  
     Very quickly, Werner Heisenberg noticed the close similarity between the proton and 
neutron. He supposed that they were two states of the same particle, the nucleon. A 
natural formalism was copied from that describing spin - ½: the proton was described as 
the ‘up’ state and the neutron as the ‘down’ state, where n denotes the neutron and p 
denotes the proton it can be written as follows:  
|𝑛⟩= (0
1) = |
1
2 −
1
2⟩ 𝑎𝑛𝑑 |𝑝⟩= (1
0) = |
1
2
1
2⟩.  
(Baez & Huerta, 2010, p.6; Marrone, 2007 , p.9)   
     By itself, this formalism seems to have little content, apart from saying that the masses 
are the same. In subsequent years the picture was gradually filled in. The conclusion was 
that two nuclei tend to be extremely close in mass if the number of protons is exchanged 
with the number of neutrons, suggesting that the short-range p-p interaction and the n-n 

 
 
99
interaction are the same. Moreover, p-n scattering strength is very close to n-n scattering 
strength.  
     In 1936 Cassen and Condon proposed that the short-range nuclear force is actually 
invariant under the whole continuous group SU(2), so that all the richness of true angular 
momentum conservation can be carried over to ‘isospin’. This was verified 
experimentally after the Second World War when the pion or π-meson was discovered. 
The pion virtually carries the nuclear force as the photon virtually carries the 
electromagnetic force. By identifying the three differently charged pions π+, π0, π- as the 
three states of an isospin-1 particle, the conservation of ‘isospin-angular momentum’ 
could be verified nontrivially (Baez & Huerta, 2010, p.8) 
ii. 
Higher symmetries 
     The explosion of new particles generated by accelerators in the 1950's led 
to the introduction of SU(3) discovered independently by Murray Gell-Mann and Yuval 
Ne'eman around 1962 (Harari, 2006, 72). This was the prelude to even larger groups such 
as supersymmetry and the Grand Unification Theory groups, SU(5) and SO(10) (Baez & 
Huerta, 2010, p32, p42). Since these groups no longer connected with quaternions and 
are beyond the scope of this dissertation. 
iii. 
Electroweak isospin  
     Quaternions enter once more in the unified theory of electromagnetic and weak 
interactions often called the electroweak interactions merging into the electroweak force. 
This model was independently presented by Steven Weinberg in 1967and Abdus Salam 

 
 
100
in 1968. Also in the 1960’s Glashow independently proposed the symmetry structure 
SU(2) × U(1). The model became known as the Glashow-Weinberg-Salam Model. This 
model unified the weak and electromagnetic interaction between elementary particles. 
This won the three of them the Nobel Prize in 1979 (Xin, 2007, p.1).  
     Here the weak interaction is described as making transitions between the up and down 
members of left-handed isodoublets. This is referred to as a  
U(1) × SU(2) gauge theory. The fermions live in U(1), fermions are particles with 
 ½ spin, and the weak isospin is SU(2). This means that these doublets are subject to the 
SU(2) ‘electroweak gauge group’ which is exact but ‘spontaneously broken’. This means 
that these are symmetries by the standards of the laws of physics, but are not symmetries 
in a vacuum and need extremely high energies to be displaced (Baez & Huerta, 2010, p. 
32).   
     For example, the neutrino is an ‘up’ particle whose ‘down’ partner is the left-handed 
electron. The W is an isospin-1 object that plays a role analogous to that of the pion in 
strong interactions. These interactions predicted massive particles W and Z bosons and 
ultimately led to the prediction of the  famous Higgs boson, sometimes referred to as the 
‘God Particle’. The W and Z bosons were experimentally verified in 1983 and more 
recently the Higgs boson in 2012. To go any further into this subject would be beyond 
the scope of this thesis.  
 
 
 

 
 
101
F. Octonions and String Theory 
       In Chapter III Section E, the discovery of octonions in the 1840's by John Graves 
and, independently, Arthur Cayley was discussed. Octonians round out the list of division 
algebras that can be constructed from finite-dimensional real matrices. The whole list is 
R (reals; 1 x 1), C(complex; 2 x 2), H(quaternions; 4 x 4), O(octonions; 8 x 8). 
     Over a century later, these four division algebras were found to play a part in the basic 
construction of the intriguing and controversial branch of Quantum Field Theory known 
as String Theory. Only an extremely thin and superficial discussion can be given here. 
     Quantum Gravity was a way to synthesize quantum mechanics with gravity (General 
relativity). Unfortunately the localization of a particle to a point in space led to 
uncomfortable infinities. These could be softened by stretching the point out to a tiny 
string. Just as a point traces out a 1-dimensional trajectory or ‘curve’ in space-time, so a 
string traces out a 2-dimensional manifold or ‘sheet’ (Rovelli, 2008,4) 
     Often a torus is used to model this, Figure 20, where the length of the string around 
the torus corresponds to the particle mass (Zimmerman Jones, 2010, p.17,). String theory 
is deeper and more complex than this analogy, but this gives a basic idea about how string 
theory works.  
 
 
 
 

 
 
102
Figure 20: Two ways a string can wrap around a torus  
(Adopted from Zimmerman Jones, 2010, p.17) 
 
 
 
     The rest mass of each kind of particle is to be identified with the frequency of 
oscillation, sometimes called a vibration, of some mode of deformation of the tiny string. 
For example if space-time has D-dimensions, then space itself has D - 1, but one of these 
cannot be used as a deformation because the string is not deformed by sliding it along its 
own length. Therefore there are D - 2 directions of deformation. This is analogous to the 
two directions of polarization of light, in our usual space-time where D = 4. For reasons 
outside this discussion, the amplitude of vibration must be described by one of the four 
generalizations of real numbers R, C, H, O mentioned earlier. Hence there are only one 
of the four possibilities: D - 2 = 1; 2; 4; 8 or D = 3; 4; 6; 10. It should also be noted that 
the possibilities D > 4 are not ruled out because in addition to the 4 dimensions of space-
time that present themselves to the physical reality perceived in everyday life there can 
be additional dimensions that are curled up into tiny finite strings that are not perceived 
in everyday reality, but large enough to be accommodated by tiny strings.  
     So far this describes only classical string theory. The process of quantization produces 
unwanted extra terms in the particle masses. These are known as known as ‘anomalies’. 

 
 
103
Fortunately there is a classical term of the opposite sign. Since the quantum anomaly 
receives a contribution from each direction of ‘polarization’, its total value is proportional 
to D - 2; this raises the possibility of choosing D so that the classical term is exactly 
cancelled. For strings admitting both bosonic and fermionic vibration modes, the 
cancellation is exact if D  2 = 8, that is if D = 10. This is the famous 10-dimensional 
string theory that emerges, and the octonions are the unique division algebra that supports 
it (Baez, n.d., p.9; Baez & Huerta, 2011, pp. 64-65). 
      One of the interesting aspects of string theory is how a rather obscure idea such as 
octonions became so important. So much so that John C. Baez & and John Huerta wrote 
an article for Scientific American about this calling it The strangest Numbers in String 
Theory (Baez & Huerta, 2011). 
          Although what has been presented in this chapter is largely superficial with regard 
to the highly complex and deep physics discussed it is hoped that the contents will show 
how quaternions and their relatives have found their way into physics. Ideas that were 
once considered, perhaps, a bit strange during their time of conception have become a 
major part of modern, and post-modern ideas about how the physical universe works. 
Chapter V 
JURY EVALUATION OF THE SOURCE BOOK 
     The jury of readers who agreed to judge this source book consisted of six readers who 
are professors mainly teaching in public urban universities and received their PhD’s in 
applied or pure mathematics from public urban universities. One of these readers did his 

 
 
104
dissertation on quaternions, but from a purely mathematical prospective. Another is an 
emeritus physics professor from an urban Ivy League University, who received his PhD 
from an Ivy League University physics department. It was with this professor that the 
author had the deepest and most valuable conversations about this sourcebook and the 
thesis in general. 
     The following questionnaire was used as a guide for discussions with the jury 
members. The readers were initially asked to fill out the questionnaire in writing. It was 
then followed up by either an in-person or phone interview. The interviews were recorded 
by the author.  
1. Mathematical and scientific accuracy of the monograph. 
     Here all the readers agreed that the information contained in the sourcebook is 
accurate, but a few mentioned that more definitions and/or examples were needed in key 
places and in some places clearer explications were needed in the chapter on the 
mathematics of quaternions, Chapter III. One reader added that the need for many 
definitions, “…in order to make the mathematics readable by a large audience”.  
2. Are there other areas of historical, mathematical or scientific study, which you 
are aware of that should be included in this monograph? 
     Here most agreed that given the intended audience the source book is adequate. There 
was some discussion about some aspects of the physics part that needed to be reworked 
since initially it was too wordy, and could benefit from a more mathematical exposition. 
Although the person making this observation believed that the choice of subjects 

 
 
105
discussed was very good, his concerns were more about details, agreeing that the physics 
itself was accurate, but could be presented better.  
     Others made it clear that the choice of topics is one of the strongest aspects of the 
source book. Rather than a collection of topics, the choice made by the author shows how 
these topics are connected in one cohesive source.   One added in his interview that the 
source book is, “…a very good source for students to see how the concepts connect.” 
3. Does the manuscript include appropriate modern applications? 
     Here again, all agreed that the sourcebook has adequate and appropriate modern 
applications. As one reader, whose research interests are in group theory, wrote, “Yes. It 
is certainly a good introduction [with respect to modern applications]”. Another added 
that there are also things that could have been mentioned, for example codes. The author 
realized that there are a lot of modern applications using quaternions, but, after some 
reflection thought that details on codes and computer graphics was outside the scope of 
the source book.  
4. Is the connection between the mathematics and the physics explained 
appropriately for students of mathematics? 
     For the most part they all agreed that the connection between mathematics and physics 
was explained appropriately. One reader, a mathematician, particularly liked the section 
about Kinematics and Riged Body motion. He said in his interview, “My more advanced 
math students, who are also interested in physics, would find the sourcebook’s [Tait’s] 

 
 
106
use of quaternions in formulating a 3 dimensional version of polar coordinates readable 
and full of insights.”  
5. Is the connection between the mathematics and the physics explained 
appropriately for students of physics?  
     Most of the professors questioned are professors of mathematics and received their 
PhDs from mathematics departments. None seemed to indicate that the mathematics was 
beyond advanced undergraduate or graduate students of physics, as far as they knew. 
One mentioned in his interview that “Students of physics should be exposed to the level 
of math presented.” A professor of physics at an Ivy League University said the physics 
is, in general, ‘common knowledge’ to most physics students, except for the particulars 
about Tait’s quaternion applications.  
    A professor who worked with undergraduates in Mount Holyoke College and Medgar 
Evers, a four year college in City University of New York (CUNY), felt that the level of 
the physics was appropriate for the advanced undergraduate physics students that he 
encountered while teaching mathematics courses in these schools. 
6. How appropriate is the manuscript as an ancillary monograph for 
undergraduate and graduate instructors? 
     All agreed that it is appropriate, one of the readers wrote, “The manuscript will make 
a wonderful addition as an ancillary resource for graduate and undergraduate 
instructors.” Another mentioned in an interview that “The historical part is very useful. 
Physicists and mathematicians will not encounter how [these subjects] historically were 

 
 
107
done.” Another mentioned in an interview that this was the strongest part of the source 
book adding that “There is very little in terms of work like this for instructors” For 
example, he added that “if someone is teaching an undergraduate course in mathematics 
…[students] who need something robust”. He then discussed the relationship between 
mathematics and its history adding that “… the historical detail and some of the other 
things could be of use [in a course]. This is a really nice resource for instructors in this 
regard.” He mentioned later in the interview that an instructor “…can parse in ways that 
may be appropriate for students.” 
7. How appropriate is the manuscript as an ancillary monograph for 
undergraduate and graduate students? 
     The consensus was that the sourcebook is fine for graduate students, but, depending 
on the background of the undergraduate, could be challenging. As one of the readers put 
it, “…in a few sections undergrads might need some guidance to follow all of the ideas.” 
Another mentioned in an interview that the source book is, “…a good source for students, 
historically speaking.” Another reader said that this is very good for a graduate student 
who “are interested and motivated by this kind of reading”, but would be more 
challenging for an undergraduate student. He also added that it could be “…quite useful 
as a summer research project for an advanced undergraduate student …and extremely 
useful for graduate students…on issues related to quaternions.” 
8. How (if any) use would this manuscript be to your department or in other 
departments or institutions that you know of? 

 
 
108
     Most of the professors interviewed teach in urban public colleges that are a part of a 
larger urban public university. The colleges that they are affiliated with do not teach 
many graduate or advanced undergraduate courses. Most mentioned that it would be 
good supplementary material for a modern abstract algebra or linear algebra course.  
     One of the readers mentioned the source book could be used as part of a mathematics 
education course in The University of Denver where he is presently teaching. He 
mentioned that it would be useful for this course for its historical content. He elaborated 
on this in a later interview “…for example a course I am teaching this winter [2015, 
quarter system] on the use of history, philosophy in mathematics education. It is clear 
that to elect this [course], it [the source book] really integrates mathematics in its historic 
context. This is of vital importance in this kind of course” He then started to discuss about 
the relationship between mathematics and its history saying that “…if one really wants 
to understand mathematics it is good to know how these questions emerged, in historical 
context… it [the source book] would be useful in this regard.” He continued, thinking 
outside his immediate department, he has, over the years been involved in a number of 
undergraduate summer research projects in various schools and said that the source book 
would “… serve as a really good resource as an undergraduate student research project 
on quaternions or more probably quaternion algebras, this would serve as a wonderful 
resource in that direction…it [the source book] allows for many places of exploration.” 
He summarized saying that he can see this source book being used for a “…course for a 
mathematics, period, [pure mathematics] and I can think of a number of variations in 
between [pure mathematics and physics].” He saw the source book as useful for both 

 
 
109
undergraduate mathematics and graduate mathematics, but stressed that it can also useful 
in mathematics education.   
9. Based on your experience at the undergraduate and/or graduate level, how 
appropriate is the material in the monograph for students who may be 
interested in the subject matter at yours or any institution you are familiar 
with? 
      Here most said that the material is accessible, but weaker students may need some 
guidance in order to properly understand the material. One of the readers suggested that 
it would make an excellent source for summer reading for a student after finishing their 
undergraduate degree, before entering graduate school, in mathematics or physics. This 
person mentioned in an interview that this source book “…can be used to communicate 
interesting ideas in mathematics” for certain students in mathematics education. He also 
remarked that there is too little of this type of source book done in mathematics education 
and the author of this source book is doing something of value not only for mathematics 
and physics, but also for mathematics education. 
 
        The author reworked the source book according to the suggestions made by the 
readers. After some reworking of the physics part of the sourcebook by the author it was 
agreed that it would be of interest to physics students who are interested in the history of 
quaternions in their respected subject. It was also agreed that there was a need for this 
type of source book to be available for advanced physics and mathematics students and 

 
 
110
instructors in order to get a sense of the ‘bigger picture’ of the historical connection with 
mathematics of quaternions.    
Chapter VI 
SUMMARY, CONCLUSIONS, AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
 
     This thesis has focused mainly on historical framework by which quaternions have 
evolved over some 150 years.  Here the author has only given very brief discussions on 
how quaternions and their relatives have reemerged in recent years, perhaps in new 
clothing, but conceptually remaining intact.  
     Quaternions have been making a substantial come back after a long   absence. The 
reemergence of quaternions has not only been in physics, but have found themselves all 
over the place in such diverse areas from computer animation to aviation. In this thesis 
the author has tried to explore some of the reasons why and how this has happened, 
focusing on theoretical physics.  
     The main focus of this thesis is to provide a sourcebook for a topic that is deeply 
embedded in the modern theoretical physics consciousness, yet rarely explored beyond 
its numerous applications. It is not the goal of this thesis to come up with new ideas about 
how quaternions used in theoretical physics or how to apply them beyond known 
techniques, but merely give an exposition of how they evolved and became embedded in 
today’s physics.  
A. Summary 
      This thesis opened with the conception of quaternions by Hamilton and their romantic 
discovery during a walk on Bloom Bridge on October 16, 1843. The central focus of this 

 
 
111
thesis has been historical, specifically related how quaternions and their associated 
rotation groups have been applied to theoretical physics.            
     Tait was the first mathematician to develop quaternions seriously in physics. His 
influence opened the doors to almost a cult following of this subject. Tait also influenced 
Maxwell and the formulations of his famous equations that students still encounter today. 
Whether Maxwell would have used quaternions in his electromagnetic theory without 
Tait’s influence is hard to say; but this particular application of quaternions did influence 
the development of vector analysis by Gibbs and Heaviside.  
     Quaternion concepts were part of the zeitgeist of Grassmann, who was outside the 
academic establishment, developed exterior algebras. Grassmann’s work was an 
inspiration to a number of mathematicians and scientists including Gibbs. Ultimately it 
was Clifford who developed geometric algebras by incorporating the best of quaternions 
and Grassmann’s exterior algebras. Although Grassmann was not recognized during his 
lifetime his work ultimately made a substantial mark on the development of vector 
analysis.     
     After their ‘cult phase’ quaternions gave way to vector analysis around the mid-1880s. 
Vectors by this time was essentially a ‘watered down’ version of quaternions, as 
Feynman’s quote (Feynman, 1999, pp. 200-201) implies. The ‘vector’ or ‘pure 
quaternion’ part was useful in physics where the primary focus was on classical 
problems. Matrices and vector analysis proved to be the right tools for these applications. 
This pushed quaternions into obscurity into 20th century, (Stephenson, 1966). This was 
fine until the advent of relativity and quantum mechanics. Here quaternions were 

 
 
112
rediscovered by Wolfgang Pauli in order to solve problems about spin in quantum 
mechanics. GUT’s and associated theories opened up an explosion of quaternion type 
rotation groups giving theoretical physicists powerful tools into the 21st century. 
     This thesis demonstrates how mathematics that was developed in the 19th century has 
become relevant to today’s thinking in theoretical physics. It is for this reason that 
Chapter’s II and III are devoted to the mathematical historical development during the 
19th century. These two chapters were meant to provide the mathematical backdrop for 
Chapter IV. Chapter IV was devoted to the applications of quaternions and their 
associated rotation groups and algebras to theoretical physics starting with Tait’s 
Elementary Treatise of Quaternions. The chapter continues to follow quaternions and 
their relatives into their recent explosion as an integral part of modern theoretical physics 
research.     
B. Conclusions   
     As discussed the goal of this thesis has been to draft a source book that would show 
how mathematical and physical ideas can be synthesized into powerful theories about 
how our universe works. Unfortunately the author of this thesis was unable to give more 
complete discussions of all the topics discussed and some topics were discussed more 
deeply than others as a result. Thus this thesis became a compilation of many works by 
other authors of varying disciplines and backgrounds within the history of mathematics, 
mathematics and physics. This would include those who have done, and still do, research 
or study these subjects for various reasons. In this sense this thesis was a success: the 

 
 
113
subjects discussed were varied and some conceptually and technically complicated yet a 
thread could be drawn to connect them all within a coherent historical and mathematical 
framework that could give a beginner a ‘bigger picture’ about how all these subjects fit 
together.       
     Educational programs have been developed to incorporate quaternions into the 
mathematics and physics curriculums since their beginning. One of the issues that have 
come up is where to place quaternions within the mathematics or physics curriculum 
(Cajori, 1890, p.293). For example, should they be placed in Geometry, Modern Algebra, 
or Linear Algebra courses, to name a few possibilities?  
      A few traditional introductory textbooks do introduce quaternions. For example, 
Serge Lang’s in Liner Algebra introduces them in the section on Geometric 
interpretation in dimension 3 (Lang, 1987 , p.287). He also introduces quaternions in his 
Algebra as an example of a group that is generated by 2 elements (Lang, 2002, p.9) and 
later on develops them in the form of exercises (Lang, 2002 ,p.545,p.723,p.758), 
similarly in Michael Artin , Algebra (Artin, 1991, p.306), Birkhoff & Mac Lane, A Survey 
Of Modern Algebra-fourth edition (Birkhoff & Mac Lane, 1977 , p.258) to name a few.   
       In Physics, Herbert Goldstein in Classical Mechanics 2nd edition discussed them in 
the text (Goldstein, 1980, 156). By the 3rd edition a section called Quaternion Group was 
added to the appendix (Goldstein, Poole & Safko, 2000, 610). Other, more specialized 
books in mathematical methods in physics also include quaternions. For example George 
B. Arfken and Hans J. Weber Mathematical Methods For Physicists Sixth Edition, the

of spinners and Clifford algebras in the aforementioned book (Arfken & Weber, 2005, 
p.212).        
     Due to the recent interest in quaternions they have become part of certain curriculums 
on a need to know basis. For example if a class in computer animation needs to have 
students program using quaternions, it is placed in that courses curriculum. As for 
physics, quaternions are usually introduced in the form of Pauli matrices in an 
introduction to quantum mechanics course,  but often the textbook and even the professor 
will not recognize these matrices as being a representation of the quaternions.   
C. Recommendations  
     The purpose of this thesis is to allow students, educators and instructors one cohesive 
source book to start them on their historical, mathematical or physical journey. As 
discussed, in the purpose of this study in chapter 1, the source book provides a historical 
and mathematical backdrop to the development of modern vector analysis in classical 
physics and the electromagnetic theory of Maxwell. It was discussed that Maxwell’s 
incorporation of quaternions in his electromagnetic theory was the inspiration for the 
development of Vector analysis by Gibbs and Heaviside. Before quaternions there 
weren’t vectors, or anything like it. Any student who studies classical physics will 
encounter vector analysis, but never have the notion that the mathematics that they are 
using in physics problems was inspired by the use of quaternions; even if it is a 
conceptually ‘watered down’ version of quaternions to make them more useful for 
calculations.  

 
 
115
     Quaternions would not be left in the positions of being just a ‘shadow of itself’ through 
vector analysis, but remerged in full force in the 20th century and the advent of quantum 
mechanics. Modern physics, as it turned out, needed the full power of quaternions to 
describe its nuances. Thus quaternions and their cousins and other relatives have 
reemerged in full force all over the landscape of today’s theoretical physics, as this source 
book discussed. Again most students who study quantum mechanics are unaware that the 
matrices that they use in calculations are connected to the mid-19th century discovery of 
quaternions. It is for this reason that this source book was written, in order to fill in these 
gaps, so that a student and instructor can get a sense of the ‘bigger picture’ with regard 
to the subject matter they are studying or teaching. In this way this thesis as a source 
book was a success, and the readers as the ‘jury’ of this thesis as a source book, in general, 
also agreed.  
     This thesis also provides an extensive bibliography. Many of these sources can be 
retrieved on line, whereby the student or instructor, can use these sources as a starting 
point to learn more about the topics discussed.  This is considered an important part of 
this thesis since, as my readers demonstrated, that students and instructors from varied 
interests and backgrounds, outside of theoretical physics, are interested in the subject of 
quaternions and its history. This would include group theorists, differential geometers, 
and applied mathematicians to name a few. Thus by having a vast and varied 
bibliography a reader can pick and choose what works are appropriate for them and their 
background. This thesis was not meant to be a textbook on quaternions and their relatives, 

 
 
116
but a resource that could help students and instructors choose texts and papers appropriate 
to the subject matter and level.  
     Chapter V was a summary of discussions and interviews that the author had with the 
readers of the source book. All the readers are professionals in their fields and had some 
interest or knowledge about quaternions and/or their associated subjects. The author of 
this thesis had them read, answer a questionnaire and/or comment on the source book 
part of this thesis. Based on what the readers wrote and said the author rewrote, added or 
deleted parts based on their comments, and the authors reflections on the discussions with 
the readers.  For the most part the structure of the source book has remained the same. 
The changes were made primarily in details, presentation and/or the addition of 
definitions and examples.
