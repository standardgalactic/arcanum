Introduction
Physics is one of eight volumes in the Science Visual Resources
set. It contains five sections, a comprehensive glossary, 
a Web site guide, and an index.
Physics is a learning tool for students and teachers. Full-color
diagrams, graphs, charts, and maps on every page illustrate the
essential elements of the subject, while parallel text provides key
definitions and step-by-step explanations.
Forces and energy provides an overview of the fundamental forces
and the basic forms of energy. This section discusses Newton’s laws
of motion, gravity, simple machines, and the relationship between
energy and forces. Conduction, convection, and radiation are also
explained as well as energy changes.
Waves, sound, and light explores the transfer of energy through
waves. Superposition, interference, diffraction, reflection, and
refraction are described in this section. The behavior of sound,
light, and other electromagnetic waves is examined in detail. Other
subjects covered in this section include seismic waves, noise and
decibel ratings, the velocity of light, and the principles of lenses
and other optical instruments.
Electricity is concerned with the phenomena associated with
electrons and protons that are stationary or moving. The theories
of electrostatics, electric current, and electromagnetism are the
principal themes of this section. Practical applications such as the
generation of electricity, AC and DC electric motors, and radio and
television are also considered.
Electronics focuses on systems that function by directing or
controlling the flow of electricity. The principles of electronic
circuitry are the main theme of this section. There are expositions
of Boolean algebra, combinational logic, and sequential logic, as
well as detailed descriptions of electronic elements such as
transistors, diodes, counting circuits, operational amplifiers, and
rectifier circuits.
Units and measurements is a short section that gives details of the
international system of units and measurements (commonly
known as SI units) used by physicists and other scientists.

Newton’s first law of

force 
friction
gravity
inertia
mass
Key words
Newton’s first law
●Newton’s first law of motion states that
an object will remain at rest or, if it is
moving it will continue to move at a
constant speed in the same direction,
unless it is acted on by an external
force. This might be a single force or
the resultant of two or more
unbalanced forces.
1 Effect of friction
●When the engine of a car is switched
off, the car will eventually come to rest
because friction and air resistance act
on the car to slow it down. If these
forces were absent the car would
continue with a constant speed in a
straight line.
2 Absence of friction
●In space there is no air. Once a rocket
has escaped the gravitational pull of
Earth it will continue to move with a
constant speed in a straight line
forever without needing any 
additional thrust from its engines.
3 Inertia
●All matter has an inbuilt opposition to
being moved or, if it is moving, to
having its motion changed. This
property is called inertia.
●When the piece of card is flicked
sharply it moves in the opposite
direction to the flick but the coin
remains where it is.
●The greater the mass of an object the
greater its inertia. The greater its
inertia, the more difficult it is to move
when it is at rest and the more difficult
it is to stop when it is in moving.
●Inertia provides a definition of mass.
The mass of a body is a measure of its
inertia.

Newton’s second law
●Newton’s second law of motion states
that an external resultant force
changes the motion of an object in
such a way that the rate of change of
the object’s momentum is
proportional to the force, and in the
same direction.
●This law may be expressed
mathematically in two ways:
force = mass x acceleration (F = ma)
impulse = change of momentum
1 Equipment and method
●The paper strip attached to the trolley
passes through a ticker-timer which
places a dot on the paper at regular
time intervals. 
●Exert a steady force on the elastic
band in the direction shown. 
2 Typical result
● As the trolley accelerates, the distance
between adjacent dots on the tape
increases. The distance traveled by the
trolley can be plotted on a graph.
3 Velocity/time graph
● The trolley’s velocity (v) equals the
distance traveled (d) divided by the
time (t). v=d/t
●As the ticker-timer places dots on the
paper at regular time intervals, the
trolley’s velocity at any point equals
the distance traveled per dot.
● The acceleration (a) of the trolley
equals its velocity divided by time.
a=v/t
●The velocity time graph is a straight
line indicating that acceleration is
uniform. The trolley’s acceleration is
given by the gradient of the graph.
● Study the effect of increased force by
increasing the number of elastic
bands used in the experiment. With
increased force, the gradient of the
graph increases, showing that the
force is proportional to the
acceleration.

Newton’s third law of
motion

Key words
Newton’s third law
●Newton’s third law of motion states
that when two objects, A and B,
interact, the force exerted by A on B is
equal in magnitude to the force
exerted by B on A, but the forces act
in opposite directions.
1 Example 1
●When a person steps forward from rest
their foot pushes backwards on Earth
and Earth exerts an equal and
opposite force forward on the person.
Two bodies and two forces are
involved.
●The small force that a person exerts
on Earth gives no noticeable
acceleration to Earth because of its
large mass. The equal force exerted on
the person, who has a much smaller
mass, causes them to accelerate.
2 Example 2
●When a person steps out of a rowing
boat they push backwards on the boat,
and the boat pushes them forwards
with an equal but opposite force.
●The friction between the boat and the
water is slight and, as the person
pushes on the boat, it starts to move
backwards reducing the forward
motion of the person, who will tend to
fall in the water between boat and
land.
3 Example 3
●When a bullet is fired from a gun,
equal and opposite forces are exerted
on the bullet and the gun as the bullet
passes down the barrel. Bullet and gun
acquire equal momentum but in
opposite directions.
mass of bullet x bullet velocity = mass
of gun x gun velocity
●Since the mass of the bullet is much
less than that of the gun, the bullet
will move forward at a much higher
velocity than the gun will move
backwards.

Key words
Nature of forces
●Force is a vector, rather than a scalar,
quantity—i.e. it has both magnitude
and direction.
●Scalar quantities, such as mass and
length, are added using normal
arithmetic but vectors are added
geometrically using the parallelogram
law (page 12) which considers both
their directions and their magnitudes.
1 Measuring force applied
● The force applied to a trolley is
measured using a force meter or a
newton meter.
2 Force applied to a trolley
● When a force F is applied to the trolley
it accelerates in the direction of the
force.
3 Opposing forces 
● If equal forces are applied to the
trolley but in opposite directions, the
trolley will remain stationary or, if it is
already in motion, it will continue in
constant motion.
4 Vector nature of force
● If forces are applied at an angle, the
resulting motion is calculated using
the parallelogram law.
● In this case, equal forces are applied at
equal angles to the trolley's axle and
the trolley moves in the direction
shown.

1 Adding parallel forces
●Forces are vector quantities, having
both magnitude and direction. A force
is often represented as an arrow,
whose length represents the relative
magnitude of the force, and direction
indicates the direction in which the
force acts.
●A resultant force is a single force that
produces the same effect as two or
more forces.
●Parallel forces act in either the same
direction or in opposite directions.
2 Adding forces
●Extend the spring by pulling two force
meters in different directions. The
force exerted by the upper force meter
is 6 N, and by the lower force meter, 
4 N. 
●The spring can be extended by the
same amount by pulling a single force
meter in a horizontal direction by 8 N.
3 The parallelogram
●Remove the equipment and draw a
line 6 cm long representing the 6 N
force between c and f, mark the end A.
●To represent the 4 N force draw a line
4 cm long between c and g. Mark 
end B.
●Complete the parallelogram by making
a 4 cm arc centered on A and a 6 cm
arc centered on B.
●The diagonal of the parallelogram is 
8 cm long, the size of the resultant
force in the experiment.
4 Components of weight
●Weight is the force that an object
exerts on the ground by virtue of
being pulled down by gravity. The
weight of an object can be resolved
into two forces (C1 and C2)acting
perpendicularly to each other.
●Cos  = C2/F therefore C2 = F cos 
●Cos  = C1/F therefore C1 = F cos α
however cos  = sin θ therefore 
C1 = F sin θ.

1 The moment of a force
●The turning effect of a force around a
point is called the moment or torque.
The moment of a force is the product
of the force and its perpendicular
distance from the turning point.
●When the crank is horizontal the
moment = F x l. 
●When the crank is 60˚ to the
horizontal the perpendicular distance
from the force to the turning point =
x = l cos 60˚. The moment in this
position is therefore = F x l cos 60˚.
2 The law of moments
●The law of moments (law of the lever)
states that when a body is in
equilibrium the sum of the clockwise
moments about any point is equal to
the sum of the anticlockwise moments
about the same point.
●When the meter rule is horizontal 
m1d1 = m2d2. Therefore, if d1 is twice
the distance d2, m1 must be half the
weight of m2. A lighter person can
counterbalance a heavier person on a
seesaw by moving nearer to the pivot.
●Provided that a meter rule is uniform
in shape and composition its mass can
be thought of as being concentrated at
its geometric center. When a meter
rule is pivoted at its center, its weight
acts at the pivot and produces no
moments otherwise the weight of the
rule must be taken into account in
calculations on moments.
3 Parallel forces in
equilibrium
●As the truck moves across the bridge
from pillar 1 towards pillar 2, the
anticlockwise moments about the top
of pillar 2 decrease and therefore the
magnitude of C1 decreases. 
●Conversely, the clockwise moments
acting about the top of pillar 1
increase and therefore the magnitude
of C2 increases.

Momentum
●Momentum, a vector quantity is the
product of an object’s mass and
velocity. 
●It is measured in kilogram meters per
second, kgms-1 or Newton seconds.
●Following Newton’s laws of motion, a
system’s total momentum is constant
unless a net external force acts. This
applies in cases of impact and
disintegration.
1 Transferred momentum
●The momentum of pendulum A is
transferred to pendulum B.
2 Collision of two cars
●If the cars were traveling with equal
momentum in opposite directions
before impact they would remain at
the point of impact as the net
momentum would be zero.
●If one car had more momentum than
the other the cars would continue to
move after impact.
3 Rocket propulsion
●The momentum of the rocket moving
in one direction is equal to the
momentum of the exhaust gases
moving in the opposite direction. 
4 Conservation of
momentum
● In momentum calculations, movement
to the right is considered positive,
movement to the left negative.
● When the spring is released the
trolleys move apart as shown. 
● Since momentum is conserved
momentum of trolley A + momentum
of trolley B = 0.
● Mass of trolley A = 2m; velocity = - vA.
Its momentum = - 2m x vA. Mass of
trolley B = m; velocity vB. Its
momentum = mvB. 
As momentum is conserved, 
- 2mvA + mvB = 0; 2mvA = mvB
Trolley A's velocity is half trolley B's.

1 Kepler’s laws
●Kepler’s first law states that the orbit
of each planet is an ellipse with the
Sun at one focus. The orbits of the
planets are often shown as circular.
●Kepler’s second law (the law of area)
states that the radius vector joining
each planet to the Sun covers equal
areas in equal times.
2 Sun's gravitational force
● The Sun attracts the planets with a
force proportional to their mass and
inversely proportional to the square of
their distance from the Sun.
3 Universal gravitation
●The force of attraction, F, between two
bodies of mass m1 and m2 which are
distance R apart is given by
F = g m1 m2
R2
●g is the gravitational constant. Its value
is 6.67 x 10-11 N m2 kg-2.
4 Measuring G
● In 1798 Cavendish measured the very
small gravitational forces exerted on
two large lead spheres by two small
gold spheres 5 mm in diameter using a
torsion balance. A calibrated wire is
twisted with force (F).
g is calculated by substituting values
for F, m1, m2 and R in the formula
F = g m1 m2
R
where
m1 is the mass of gold sphere
m2 is the mass of lead sphere
R is the distance between the centers
of m1 and m2

1 Gravity: action at a
distance
●The force of gravity acts through
space and can cause an object which is
not in contact with Earth to fall to the
ground. 
●Earth is surrounded by a gravitational
field which exerts a force on any
object within that field. The strength
of a gravitational field is defined as the
force acting on unit mass in the field.
●Measurements on Earth’s surface show
that an object of mass 1 kg
experiences a force of 9.8 N due to
gravity; i.e. its weight is 9.8 N. 
●The strength of Earth’s field is
denoted by g and is 9.8 N kg-1. Since N
= kg ms-2, g can also be given as 9.8 m
s-2, the acceleration due to gravity.
2 Free fall and terminal
velocity in air
●When an object falls through the air
the force of weight acts downwards,
pulling it towards the ground while
the force of air resistance acts in the
opposite opposing this motion. 
●Initially, the falling object speeds up
however, as it does, air friction
increases and reduces its acceleration.
Eventually, the upward force due to air
friction is equal to the weight of the
object and the resultant force is zero.
The object no longer accelerates but
falls at a constant velocity called its
terminal velocity.
3 Free fall and terminal
velocity in a liquid
●Objects moving through viscous
liquids behave in exactly the same way.
●The ball bearing initially accelerates
but as it does the friction acting on it
from the oil increases. At some point
the ball bearing reaches a constant
velocity—its terminal velocity.

Center of gravity and
stability
center of mass
equilibrium
Key words
1 Center of gravity
● A body behaves as if its whole weight
is concentrated at one point which is
called the center of gravity. Since the
force of gravity is effectively constant
over the small volume of an object on
Earth, the center of gravity and center
of mass are effectively the same point.
●In a regular flat shape, the center of
gravity is at the geometric center of
the shape.
●In an irregular flat shape the center of
gravity is found by suspending the
shape on a nail so that it can swing
freely, and tying a plumb line (a thread
with a weight attached) to the nail.
The shape hangs in such a way that its
center of gravity is directly below the
point from which it is suspended i.e.
there is no moment in either
direction. The position of the plumb
line is marked and the process
repeated, suspending the shape from
a different place. The center of gravity
is where the two lines intersect.
2 Stability
●An object’s shape and position  affects
whether it topples over easily or not.
●An object will topple over if its center
of gravity moves outside its base.
●Objects with broad bases are more
stable than objects with narrow bases.
3 Equilibrium
●An object is in stable equilibrium if,
when released after a small
displacement (to the position marked
with a dotted outline), it moves back
to its original position.
●An object is in unstable equilibrium if,
when released after a small
displacement, it moves further away
from its original position.
●An object is in neutral equilibrium if,
when released after a small
displacement, it remains in the
new position.

1 Gravitational forces
●The gravitational potential energy, E,
of an object of weight F newtons
which is h meters above the ground is
given by E = F x h. Rearranging this
equation gives F = E
h
●The gradient of the graph at any point
is the gradient of the tangent at that
point. As the curve is uniform, a good
approximation is obtained by taking
values equidistant from the point and
calculating the ratio of the change in
energy, ∆E, to the change in distance,
∆h.
●As an object moves further away from
Earth, the attraction it experiences as a
result of Earth’s gravitational field
decreases. The curve is asymptotic
and thus the force never actually
becomes zero, but it becomes so small
as to be insignificant.
2 Repulsive and attractive
forces between atoms
● As atoms move together, their outer
electron shells exert a repulsive force
on each other.
● At smaller separation distances.
however, a force of attraction between
atoms increases. 
● The attractive and repulsive forces can
be combined to give the net force for
any separation distance.
● While the attractive force becomes
zero for large separations, it decreases
less rapidly than does the repulsive
force, and there is a separation
distance at which the attractive force
operates after the repulsive force has
become zero.
● At the equilibrium separation distance
the repulsive force equals the
attractive force and the atoms are
stable.

Simple machines
●A machine is a device in which a force
applied at one point gives an output
force elsewhere. 
● The work done by a machine, E,
equals the force applied multiplied by
the distance moved, E = F x d. 
● The force ratio (mechanical
advantage) of a machine is the ratio
of the load to the effort.
force ratio = load/effort
● The distance ratio (velocity ratio) of a
machine is the ratio of the distance
moved by the effort to the distance
moved by the load.
distance ratio = distance moved by
effort/distance moved by load
● Force multipliers have both a high
force ratio and a high distance ratio. 
● Distance multipliers have both a low
force ratio and a low distance ratio.
Levers
● These simple machines are all based
on levers. Their action is based on the
law of moments. A lever may act as a
force multiplier or a distance
multiplier.
● Crowbars, wheelbarrows, and
nutcrackers are force multipliers. A
small effort force is applied over a
large distance to exert a large force on
the load over a small distance.
● The forearm is a distance multiplier. A
large effort force is applied over a
small distance to exert a small force on
the load over a large distance.

● A first order lever has the fulcrum
between the effort and load.

●A simple pulley does not magnify the
force applied but changes the
direction that the force acts. Distance
ratio is 1.
●In 2- and 4-pulley systems a small
effort raises a large load. In a 2-pulley
system for every 1 m by which the
load is raised the effort is applied for 2
m, thus the distance ratio is 2. In a 
4-pulley system the distance ratio is 4.
●If pulley systems were perfect
machines they would be frictionless
and no energy would be lost thus,
using a 4-pulley system, a 40 N load
would be raised 1 m by an effort of 
10 N moving a distance of 4 m.
●The efficiency of a machine is the ratio
of useful work done, or energy
output, to the work or energy input.
efficiency = work input   x 100%
work output
or
efficiency = force ratio    x 100%
distance ratio
●The efficiency of a machine is always
less than 100% as not all of the energy
input does useful work.
2 Screw threads
●In a screw thread machine, the thread
is usually turned by a handle. Distance
ratio equals ratio of the circumference
of the circle made by the effort to the
pitch of the screw.
3 Water wheels
●Water wheels are driven by flowing
water. 
4 Gear wheels
●The force ratio and distance ratio of a
machine can be changed by gears. 
●The 15 teeth gear makes two
revolutions for each complete
revolution of the 30 teeth gear.
● If the effort is applied to the smaller
gear to drive the larger gear the
distance ratio is 2.

Key words
1 Newcomen engine
●Newcomen built the first practical
engine in the early eighteenth century.
Water is heated in the boiler, and turns
to steam which is injected into the
cylinder under high pressure, forcing
the piston upwards. A spray of cold
water is injected into the cylinder
causing the steam to condense,
drastically reducing pressure in the
cylinder. The piston is forced down by
atmospheric pressure. Movement is
transferred to a load via a pivot.
●Pressure volume relation. The
pressure in the cylinder rises A) as
steam is injected into it and remains
constant B) as the piston rises. When a
spray of cold water is injected into the
cylinder the pressure rapidly falls C) as
the steam condenses and remains
constant D) as the piston is forced
down by atmospheric pressure.
2 Internal combustion
●In a four-stroke internal combustion
engine a mixture of air and petrol
burns within the cylinder.
●During the induction stroke the inlet
valve opens and the air-petrol mixture
passes into the cylinder.
●During the compression stroke both
inlet and outlet valves are closed and
the air-petrol mixture is compressed.
●During the ignition stroke, still with
both the inlet and outlet valves closed,
the air-petrol mixture is ignited by an
electrical discharge from a spark plug.
This causes a rapid increase in
pressure within the cylinder as the air-
petrol mixture is converted to exhaust
gases. This increase in pressure forces
the piston down.
●During the exhaust stroke the outlet
valve opens allowing the exhaust gases
to leave the cylinder.
● The pressure volume changes during
the cycle are shown on the diagram.

● Liquids are almost incompressible and
transmit pressure applied to them.
They are used in hydraulic machines.
1 Hydraulic jack
●On the downstroke the valve from the
fluid reservoir is closed and the valve
into the jack cylinder is open. Fluid is
forced from the pump cylinder to the
jack cylinder by the pump piston. This
forces up the jack piston.
●On the upstroke the valve leading to
the jack cylinder closes. The pressure
in the pump cylinder falls and
atmospheric pressure forces the valve
from the fluid reservoir to open.
Atmospheric pressure forces fluid into
the pump cylinder.
●Pressure, force and area are related.
pressure = force
area
●The pressure exerted by the pump
piston equals that exerted on the jack
piston. As the area of the jack piston is
large, the force exerted on the jack
piston is large. However, the pump
piston moves down more than the jack
piston moves up. The work done by
the pump piston equals the work done
on the jack piston.
2 Car’s hydraulic braking
system
●A car braking system consists of a
master cylinder and a series of slave
cylinders.
●When the brake pedal is depressed
pressure is transferred from the master
cylinder to each slave cylinder.
●In a disc brake, a pair of brake pads
acts on a spinning disc attached to the
wheel. 
●In a drum brake a drum rotates about a
pair of brake shoes, each fitted with a
lining.

Key words
1 Lift pump
●A lift pump must first be primed by
pouring water above the piston to
prevent air leaking past it.
●On the upstroke the piston valve
closes and the pressure in the barrel
falls. Atmospheric pressure acting on
the surface of the water forces water
up the pipe through the open valve
into the barrel. Water above the piston
pours out of the barrel through the
spout.
●On the downstroke the valve at the
base of the barrel closes and the valve
in the piston opens. Water passes from
below the piston to above it. The
barrel above the piston fills, ready for
the next upstroke.
●Atmospheric pressure can only
support a column of water 10 metres
high so this is the maximum
theoretical distance there can be
between the bottom of the barrel and
the surface of the water.
2 Force pump
●On the upstroke the valve leading to
the reservoir closes and the valve at
the bottom of the barrel opens. This
reduces the pressure in the barrel.
Atmospheric pressure acting on the
surface of the water forces water
through the open valve.
●On the downstroke the valve at the
bottom of the barrel closes and the
valve leading to the reservoir opens.
Water is forced into the reservoir and
ultimately out through the spout. 
●During a downstroke the air in the
reservoir is compressed while on an
upstroke it expands. This helps to
keep a steady flow of water.
●A force pump can raise water more
than 10 metres provided the base of
the barrel is less than 10 metres from
the surface of the water.

1 Work
●Work is the amount of energy
transferred from one form into others. 
●A suspended weight has potential
energy. When it falls, potential energy
is transferred to kinetic energy. Kinetic
energy does work, resulting in the
water being heated.
2 Heat
●A filament lamp or fuel combustion
both release heat energy which can
heat water. Work is not done because
the energy is not transferred from one
form to others; it simply moves from a
region of high temperature to a region
of low temperature.
3 Adiabatic work
●In an adiabatic process no heat enters
or escapes a closed system.
● The change in the internal energy of a
system, U, equals the sum of the
energy entering the system by heating,
Q, and the energy entering the
system through work being done on
it, W.
● For an adiabatic process Q = 0
therefore U = W.
● Any work done is equal to the increase
in internal energy.
● Heating: work done by falling weight
heats the enclosed system.
● Increasing electrical charge: work
done by falling weight charges the
electrical cell.
● Magnetization: work done by falling
weight magnetizes the iron.
● Compression of a gas: if a gas is
compressed in a perfectly insulated
cylinder, the work done on the gas
equals the increase in internal energy
of the gas and the temperature of the
gas rises. If the gas is then allowed to
expand adiabatically, work is done at
the expense of the internal energy and
the temperature of the gas falls.

●When a hot body and cold body are

appears to stop after a period of time.
The bodies are said to be in thermal

common property they have.

water vapor exist in equilibrium. 
3 Constant-volume gas
thermometer
● To find an unknown temperature, T,
firstly find the pressure of the gas at
the triple point, PTP, by placing the
thermometer bulb in a triple-point
cell. The pressure, PT, at the unknown
temperature is determined while
keeping the volume of the gas
constant.
Using the universal gas law—
P1V1/T1=P2V2/T2
T = 273.16 x PT /PTP
4 Resistance thermometer
● The electrical resistance of pure
platinum wire increases significantly
between the melting point of ice (R0)
and the boiling point of water (R100).
The thermometer is connected to a
Wheatstone bridge circuit. If P equals
Q then the resistance of the platinum
wire RT at unknown temperature T
equals that of S.
T = 100 x (RT–R0)/(R100–RT)°C.

Kelvin scale
Key words
1 Fahrenheit
●The Fahrenheit was devised at the
start of the eighteen century. On this
scale the ice point is 32˚ and the
steam point 212˚. These figures arose
because Fahrenheit did not use the ice
point and steam fixed points but chose
an unspecified ice/salt mixture for the
lower fixed point, to which he gave
the value 0˚, and human body
temperature which was given the value
96˚.
●The Fahrenheit scale is still sometimes
used in the context of weather but is
only of historical interest in science.
2 Celsius
●In 1742 the Swedish astronomer
Anders Celsius proposed a
temperature scale in which ice melted
at 0˚ and water boiled at 100˚. The
Celsius scale is widely used,
sometimes being referred to as the
centigrade scale since there are 100
degrees between the fixed points.
Temperatures on this scale are given in
‘degrees Celsius’, ˚C.
●One disadvantage of the Celsius scale
is that temperatures below the
freezing point of ice are negative.
3 Kelvin
●In 1848 the physicist William Thomson
(later Lord Kelvin) suggested a
temperature scale which started at the
lowest theoretically possible
temperature, absolute zero. This is
known as the absolute or Kelvin
temperature scale. Degrees on this
scale are called kelvins and are
denoted by K (not ˚K). A kelvin is
exactly the same size as a Celsius
degree i.e. 1 K = 1 ˚C.

Key words
Thermal conduction
●Thermal conduction is the transfer of
internal energy from particle to
particle in matter.
●Metals are good thermal conductors.
They contain a ‘sea’ of free-moving
electrons that are able to transfer heat
quickly from one point to another.
●Non-metals are very poor conductors
of heat and are used for thermal
insulation. Insulators are used to
prevent heat from travelling such as
for the handles of pans.
1 Different conductors
●Heat is transferred along the rods by
conduction. When the end of the rod
heats up the wax melts and the thumb
tuck falls. The thumb tack on the
copper rod falls first showing that
copper is the best thermal conductor.
The thumb tack attached to the glass
rod takes much longer to fall off as
glass is a poor thermal conductor.
2 Water conduction
●Liquids and gases conduct heat but
very slowly. Very little heat is
transferred through water by
conduction.
●When the water at the bottom of a
test-tube is heated warm water rises by
convection and melts an ice cube on
the surface.
●When water at the top of a test-tube is
heated it boils before sufficient heat is
conducted through the water to melt
the ice cube at the bottom of the test-
tube.
3 Air conduction
●Air is a very poor thermal conductor. It
is for this reason that the air space or
cavity between the outer and inner
walls of a of a building and the air
space between the layers of glass in
double glazing help to keep the inside
of the building warm in the winter and
cool in the summer.

1 Temperature gradient
1 Temperature gradient
●Some heat conducted through an
unlagged bar is lost. The temperature
gradient along the bar is therefore
non-linear. A tangent to the curve
gives the temperature gradient at that
point.
●When the bar is lagged no heat is lost
to the surroundings and the
temperature gradient along the bar is
linear.
2 Coefficient of thermal
conductivity
●A thin slab has uniform cross-sectional
area A, thickness L, and a small
temperature difference (T1-T2) is
maintained across. A small quantity of
heat, dQ, passes through it by
conduction in time t and its thermal
conductivity is k. dQ=-k A t (T1-T2)/L
(Negative sign indicating that heat
flows towards the lower temperature.)
or k = dQ L / A t (T2-T1)
● Thermal conductivity, k, is the rate of
heat flow through a material per unit
area per unit temperature gradient.
3 Effect on temperature
gradient of insulators
●The temperature drop is divided
equally over the two thin layers of
insulator and the long lagged bar.
4 Measuring k for a good
conductor
●Heat should flow through the metal at
a measurable rate and the temperature
gradient along the metal must be
sufficiently steep to measure.
5 Measuring k for a poor
conductor
●In order to achieve measurable heat
flow the material is in the form of disc
a few millimeter thick in a thick metal
casing heated by steam.

Thermal radiation
●Thermal radiation is the transfer of
heat in the form of infrared waves.
●Bodies above absolute zero emit heat
radiation whose frequency is
determined by the body’s
temperature. 
●The transfer of heat radiation does not
involve matter thus it can pass across a
vacuum.
1 Effect of surface on
absorption
●A coin is attached to each metal plate
with wax and an electric heater is
placed between the plates ensuring
each receives the same amount of
radiation. The coin attached to the
dull black surface falls first
demonstrating that dull black surfaces
are better absorbers of heat.
2 Effect of surface on
emission
●A copper sheet has one side highly
polished and the other painted dull
black. When the sheet is heated and
the backs of the hands placed at equal
distances from each side of it the back
of the hand facing the dull black
surface feels warmer demonstrating
that dull black surfaces are better
emitters of heat radiation.
3 Leslie’s cube
●John Leslie compared the radiating
powers of different surfaces using a
hollow copper cube filled with hot
water. One face was highly polished
while the opposite face was made matt
black by holding it above a candle
flame. The remaining faces were
painted in light and dark colors. 
●The matt black surface emitted most
of radiation, and the highly polished
surface least. When comparing the
sides painted different colors, the
texture of the surface appeared to be
more important than the color.

●The parabolic reflector on a fire is
highly polished. The heat radiation

●The bulb painted matt black absorbs
heat radiation more quickly. The air in
this bulb expands more quickly

pyrometer
●A pyrometer measures the

the thermal radiation emitted.
●The radiation emitted by the source is
focused onto the blackened foil to

thermcouple, the temperature of the
source can be calculated.
4 Thermopile
●Heat radiation absorbed by the
blackened discs is warms the junctions
of the wires attached to them and sets
up an e.m.f. which can be measured
either by a potentiometer or a
galvanometer connected directly to
the thermopile.
5 Disappearing filament
pyrometer
●Hot bodies emit infrared, visible light
and ultraviolet radiation. A
disappearing filament optical
pyrometer responds to light only.
●Light from the hot body and from a
tungsten filament lamp pass through a
red filter of a known wavelength. The
current passing through the filament
lamp is adjusted until it appears to be
as bright as the light from the source.
The temperature is read from the
ammeter, calibrated in K.

Convection
●Convection is the process by which
energy is transferred by the bulk
movement of a heated fluid (liquid or
gas). When a fluid is heated it expands
and its density becomes less than the
surrounding unheated fluid. Less
dense fluid rises and is replaced by
denser cooler fluid.
1 Water circulation
●Potassium permanganate dissolves in
water to give an intense purple
solution. 
●Heating the water immediately
surrounding the potassium
permanganate crystals causes it to
expand and become less dense. The
purple-coloured water rises and is
replaced by cooler colorless water. 
2 Domestic water
circulation
●When the water in the boiler is heated
it expands and rises, first to the top of
the boiler and then into the top of the
hot water cylinder. It is replaced by
cooler water passing from the bottom
of the hot water cylinder to the
bottom of the boiler. 
●There is a temperature gradient in the
hot water cylinder. Hot water is tapped
off from the top while replacement
cold water passes into the bottom.
3 Smoke transference
●The air above the candle expands and
rises up the chimney to the left. This
air is replaced by cooler air passing
down the other chimney, drawing
smoke down from the smouldering
paper. The movement of air is seen by
introducing smoke to the box.
4 Domestic smoke
circulation
●Air is drawn through a fire in order to
replace the hot air from a fire which
rises up the chimney.

1 Day–night heat exchange
●During the day land heats up more
quickly than sea resulting in a cool
breeze—a sea breeze.
●During the night land loses heat more
quickly resulting in a cool breeze from
land to sea—a land breeze.
2 Atmospheric heat
exchange
●Differential heating of the atmosphere
causes the movement of air we call
wind.
●Cold polar air falls as warm tropic air
rises forming a polar front. Polar air
cools down further as it is pushed
north and convection currents form,
circulating the air. A warm front leads
tropic air and a cold front leads polar
air.
●Air carries water vapor which
condenses into tiny droplets forming
clouds. When these droplets grow
large enough they fall as rain.
3 Dewar flask
●A Dewar flask (vacuum flask)
minimizes the transfer of thermal
energy.
●The double-walled vessel is made of
glass and the stopper of cork or
plastic. These substances are all
poor heat conductors.
●There is a vacuum between the
inner and outer walls of the
vessel, preventing convection
currents. 
●The inner surfaces of the
double-walled vessel are
silvered, reflecting back heat
radiation to the contents of the
vessel rather than losing it to the
surroundings. Similarly, heat radiation
from the surroundings is reflected
away rather than being absorbed by
the contents of the vessel.

●In all energy changes, some energy
output does not do useful work. No

●Power is the rate at which energy is
transferred from one form to another.
Power = Work done
Time taken
Power is measured in 
Js-1 = watts (W).
1 Electric motor raising a
load
●The potential energy of an object
relates to its weight and vertical height
above the ground.
Potential energy = Weight x Vertical
height above the ground
●Chemical energy ➞Electrical energy
➞Kinetic energy ➞Potential energy
●The work done raising the load is
greater than the potential energy
gained because some energy is lost as
heat.
●If the raised load is released, gravity
pulls it towards the ground. The
opposite energy transfers then occur.
Potential energy ➞Kinetic energy ➞
Electrical energy ➞ Chemical energy
The falling weight rotates the belt and
pulley. These in turn rotate the motor
which now acts as a dynamo. The
electricity generated recharges the
battery.
2 Steam engine driving a
dynamo
●Combustion is an exothermic reaction
thus heat is given out.
fuel + oxygen ➞products + energy
●Heat produced converts water to
steam at raised pressure. This drives a
turbine which drives a dynamo. The
electricity produced lights a bulb.
●A more powerful steam engine
produces more energy per unit time
and therefore makes the bulb glow
brighter.

1 Human energy
●Energy is produced in the cells of the
body by the process of respiration.
glucose + oxygen ➞
carbon dioxide + water + energy
●The basal metabolic rate (BMR) is the
minimum amount of energy needed
keep a person alive. It does not remain
constant throughout a person’s life but
changes with growth, development
and aging. A new-born baby has a low
BMR, typically 100 kJ m-2 h-1. This
rises to around 220 kJ m-2 h-1 at the
age of one, when body growth is most
rapid, and gradually declines to
between 150 – 170 kJ m-2 h-1 in a
young healthy adult. This translates to
a total energy requirement per day of
6000 – 7500 kJ.
●The energy requirement of the body
beyond BMR depends upon the level
of activity of the person and the
ambient temperature of the
surroundings. 
●The main source of heat loss from the
body is heat (infrared) radiation. 
●Heat is continually being lost in
expelled air as this is always saturated
with water vapor.
2 Domestic energy
●Buildings in temperate climates are
often heated to maintain a higher
temperature than the surroundings.
Heat is lost from the building to the
surroundings in a variety of ways.
●Energy losses can be prevented in a
variety of ways.
●The vast majority of energy use in the
average home goes on heating the
rooms and on providing hot water for
bathing. Relatively small amounts are
used for lighting and electrical
appliances, and for cooking.

Key words
1 Roof
●Warm air rises so heat losses through
the top of a house are a particular
problem. 
●In attic insulation a layer of an
insulating material is laid down
between the rafters. Materials used
have pockets of air trapped within
them. Air is a very poor conductor
of heat.
2 Wall
●Heat passes from the inside to the
outside of a wall by conduction. The
air cavity between the inner and outer
walls of a house reduces the amount
of heat conducted to the outer walls.
●In cavity wall insulation, the cavity is
filled with an insulating material. This
reduces heat losses by conduction and
prevents the formation of convection
currents which transfer heat from the
inner wall.
3 Floor
●Heat passes out of a house into the
ground by conduction.
●Underlay and carpets are made of
insulating materials which reduce heat
losses through the floor.
4 Window
●Double-glazed windows consist of two
panes of glass separated by a layer of
air. This reduces the amount of heat
lost by conduction and also prevents
the formation of convection currents
which transfer heat from the outer
surface of the inner pane of glass.
5 Draughts
●Warm air is able to pass out of, and
cold air to pass into a house through
badly-fitting doors and windows. 
●Draughts are reduced by fitting
draught excluders around doors and

Energy from the Sun
●Energy is produced on the Sun by
nuclear fusion. Mass is converted to
energy according to Einstein’s
equation E = mc2
energy = mass x speed of light 
in a vacuum2
●Every second on the Sun, 700 million
tonnes of hydrogen is converted to
695 million tonnes of helium. The
remaining 5 million tonnes of mass is
converted to energy.
●The mass of the Sun is 2.0 x 1030 kg
therefore it could maintain its current
rate of energy production for 
2.0 x 1030 / 5.0 x 106 = 4.0 x 1023 s ≈
1016 years.
●The solar constant is the solar energy
falling per second on a square meter
placed normal to the Sun’s rays at the
edge of Earth’s atmosphere when
Earth is at its average distance from
the Sun. Its value is 1.35 kW m-2.
●The actual amount of solar radiation
falling at any point on the surface of
Earth depends on four factors. The
amount of light falling on sunny
regions near to the equator is greater
than that falling on temperate regions
nearer the poles. In temperate regions
the amount of light varies with the
season. More light falls on a region
during the summer and less during
the winter. The greater the height of a
region above sea level the more light it
will receive as less light is absorbed by
the atmosphere. The higher the Sun is
in the sky the greater the amount of
light reaching the ground as less is
absorbed by the atmosphere.
●Global warming is the result of less of
the Sun’s energy being reflected and
reradiated back into space. Many
scientists attribute this to an increase
of so called “greenhouse gases,” such
as carbon dioxide and methane, in the
upper atmosphere.

1 Solar furnace
●In a solar furnace, a heliostat (a large
mirror which tracks the Sun) reflects
the Sun’s rays onto a parabolic
reflector formed of a number of plane
mirrors. The parabolic reflector
focuses the Sun’s rays onto a small
space, producing a very high
temperature.
●At the solar furnace at Odeillo in
France around 20,000 small plane
mirrors are arranged to form a
parabolic reflector of diameter 45 m. 
●The furnace generates up to 1 MW
with temperatures normally in the
range 800–2,500˚C.
2 Solar water heating
●Water is pumped through a network of
pipes in a panel directed towards the
Sun. The pipes are made of copper, a
good conductor of heat, and painted
matt black to absorb the maximum
amount of heat radiation. 
●The hot water circulates through a
heating coil in a tank where cold water
is heated.
3 Solar cells
●Solar cells or photovoltaic cells
convert solar energy directly into
electricity.
●These devices are made of layers of 
p– and n–type silicon. When light falls
on the surface the energy frees loosely
held electrons. This results in an e.m.f.
between metal contacts on the top
and bottom of the surfaces. 
●For practical purposes solar cells are
connected together to form solar
panels. Such panels have been used
widely to power satellites in space but
their use on Earth has been limited by
their high cost.

1 Typical power station
●In a power station heat is used to
produce steam at high pressure. High
pressure steam drives turbines which
are connected to a generator. 
●The generator is essentially a massive
dynamo. A magnet at the center of
the generator rotates inducing an
electric current in the coils of wire
which surround it.
●A large power station generates
electricity at 25,000 V. If electricity was
transmitted at this potential difference
the losses due to heat as it passed
down the lines would be considerable.
●The energy lost rises as the square of
the current so reducing the current
reduces the energy losses
considerably.
●Electrical power is equal to the
product of the current and potential
difference.
power = current x potential difference
●In a step-up transformer the current is
reduced while potential difference is
increased proportionally. The power
input and power output remain
essentially the same. The resulting
output from the step-up transformer
has a potential difference of 400,000 V
but a much reduced current which
reduces energy losses in the lines.
2 Energy conversions in a
power station
●Some energy is “lost” during each
energy transfer, mainly as low-level
heat. The energy is lost in the sense
that it doesn’t do useful work.
●Efficiency is the ratio of useful output
energy to input energy. The overall
efficiency of the power station is 
given by
efficiency = 
30 units of electrical energy x 100%
100 units of fuel energy
= 30%

renewed by natural processes over a
short time scale.
●Fossil fuels were formed over many
millions of years from plants and
animals.
1 Coal
●Drift mines: coal seams run to the
surface, coal is easy to remove.
●Open cast mines: coal seams are near
the surface. Overlying layers are
removed to expose the coal.
●Shaft mines: coal seams lie deep in the
ground.
2 Oil and gas
●Oil and natural gas are trapped in
porous rock beneath impermeable
rock. If rocks are folded by natural
processes, oil and gas become
concentrated at the peak of the fold. 
3 Nuclear
●Although nuclear fuels are non-
renewable, amounts used are relatively
small compared to fossil fuels and
reserves are likely to last much longer.
●The most common fuel is an isotope of
uranium, uranium U-235. This isotope
only forms 0.7% of naturally occurring
uranium. For a viable fuel, this
percentage is increased to around
2.5% by enrichment.
●The fuel for fast breeder reactors is
plutonium. The reactor is surrounded
by a blanket of uranium. Neutrons
escaping from the core of the reactor
convert uranium to plutonium
enabling the reactor to breed, or
produce more of its own fuel.

Renewable energy sources
●Renewable energy sources are those
which are renewed by natural sources.
They include solar-powered devices,
flowing water, tides, waves, wind,
geothermal aquifers, geothermal hot
dry rock structures and biogas
generators.
1 Water
●The continuous movement of water
between Earth and the atmosphere
gives rise to the water cycle.
●Water that falls on high ground has
potential energy. As the water flows
down towards the sea the energy can
be used in a variety of ways including
generating electricity in hydroelectric
plants.
2 Wind
●Heat is transferred through the
atmosphere by convection currents.
●When air is warmed it expands,
becomes less dense and rises, creating
a region of low pressure on Earth’s
surface. In turn, cooler air falls to take
its place creating an area of high
pressure. 
●Wind is air that moves from regions of
high pressure to regions of low
pressure. Wind has kinetic energy
which can be used to drive windmills
and wind turbines.
3 Tide
●The gravitational attraction of the
Moon pulls on that part of Earth’s
surface which is closest to it. This
causes a slight distortion in the land
mass but the main effect is pulling the
oceans out in a bulge in the direction
of the Moon and in the opposite
direction on the far side of Earth.
●The result is high and low tides. Water
at high tide has potential energy which
can be used to generate electricity.

3 Hydroelectric
1 Wind energy
●Modern wind technology led to the
construction of wind turbines which
are specially designed to generate
electricity from the kinetic energy of
the wind.
●To operate successfully, wind turbines
must be placed in areas where the
wind often blows and the average
wind speed is high.
2 Ocean thermal energy
conversion
●Tropical seas absorb huge amounts of
solar radiation. Ocean Thermal Energy
Conversion (OTEC) uses this energy
to generate electricity.
●OTEC makes use of the difference
between the warm surface of the
ocean and the cold water at depths
below 600 metres. Provided there is a
minimum temperature difference of
around 20˚C net power can be
generated.
●In a closed-cycle system heat from
warm surface sea water causes a
working fluid (such as ammonia) to
boil and become a gas. The resulting
increase in pressure drives a turbine
attached to a generator. Cold sea
water passes through a condenser
converting ammonia gas back to liquid
which is then recycled through the
system.
●In an open-cycle system the warm
water itself is the working fluid. Water
at the surface vaporizes in a near
vacuum providing the pressure
increase needed to drive a turbine.
The vapor is condensed by cold sea
water. The fresh water produced can
be used for drinking, irrigation or
aquaculture.
3 Hydroelectric
●In a hydroelectric plant the kinetic
energy of flowing water turns a turbine
which is connected to a generator and
electricity is produced.

Key words
1 Tidal energy
●The first and, to date, the world’s only
large-scale tidal barrage was built
between 1961 and 1966 across the
estuary of the Rance river in France.
●Tides rise and fall and different times
of the day. As a tide rises, the level of
water in the high basin rises. At high
tide all gates are closed trapping the
sea water behind the barrage. 
●At low tide the water level in the high
basin is higher than the water level in
the low basin. The water trapped in
the high basin has potential energy. It
is allowed to flow out through turbine
generators which are driven by the
moving water to produce electricity.
2 Wave energy
●Rocking booms are strung offshore
where they are kept in continual
motion by the waves. As the waves rise
and fall the boom is rocked up and
down and this motion is used to
generate electricity.
3 Tidal swell
●The wave-driven device is built in a
natural rock gulley on the coast so that
the waves are channelled into it.
●As the wave rolls in, the water level
inside the chamber rises and air is
forced upwards and out through the
turbine generator.
●As the water level falls, the air pressure
inside the chamber drops and, due to
atmospheric pressure, air is forced in
through the turbine generator.
●The turbine is a special design called a
Wells turbine which can extract energy
from the air stream no matter in which
direction it flows so electricity is
generated both as the water level rises
and falls.

1 Geothermal energy
●In some parts of the world there are
very hot rocks quite near to the
surface. When rain permeates down
into the rocks it is heated and forms a
geothermal aquifer.
●Heat energy is also extracted from
geothermal hot rock structures which
lie deeper in the ground. Two wells
are drilled into the rocks terminating
several hundred meters apart. Cold
water is piped down one of the wells
and is heated as it passes through the
hot rocks. The resulting hot water
rises to the surface through the
second well.
2 Domestic heat pump
●Refrigerators and air conditioning
units are basically heat pumps which
transfer heat energy from one place to
another. Heat pumps can be used both
for cooling and for heating. 
●A heat pump consists of a closed
system containing a volatile substance
which changes phase between being a
liquid and a gas.
●The compressor pump compresses
the gas, converting it to a liquid as it
passes into the house. This change of
state releases energy that warms the
inside of the house. When the liquid
passes back out of the house it
evaporates to become a gas. This
change of state requires energy that is
absorbed from the surroundings. The
net effect transfers heat energy from
outside to inside the house.
3 Biogas unit
●In a biogas unit, a slurry of animal
manure and water is fermented to
release biogas. The main constituent
of biogas is methane which is used as
a fuel for cooking and heating. The
residue which remains provides a
useful fertiliser for improving plant
growth.

1 Nuclear fission
●Nuclear energy results from nuclear
fission of large unstable nuclides like
uranium-235. 
●Uranium-235 undergoes spontaneous
fission, but in a nuclear power station
the fission occurs by bombarding the
uranium nuclei with neutrons. When
hit by a slow-moving neutron, the
unstable nucleus breaks into two
smaller nuclei of similar size and three
neutrons are released. The combined
mass of the products is slightly less
than the reactants; some mass is
converted to energy.
2 Chain reaction
●The three neutrons released can cause
the fission of three more uranium-235
nuclei releasing nine neutrons. These,
in turn, can cause the fission of nine
more uranium-235 nuclei and so on.
This chain reaction is controlled in a
nuclear reactor by limiting the number
of neutrons
3 Controlling a chain
reaction
●In order to increase the chances that
neutrons will cause the fission of
uranium-235 nuclei they are slowed by
a moderator.
●Control rods, suspended between the
fuel rods, can be raised or lowered as
needed to control the nuclear
reaction. They are made of alloys such
as boron steel that absorb neutrons.
When they are lowered more neutrons
are absorbed, slowing the chain
reaction.
4 Advanced gas–cooled
reactor
●Temperature is controlled in an
advanced gas-cooled reactor by
circulating carbon dioxide gas. Heat is
removed in heat exchangers which
convert water into high-pressure
steam.

Waves
●Waves may be classified as transverse
or longitudinal depending on the
direction of displacement. Both types
of wave can conveniently be shown
using a slinky spring.
1 Transverse waves
●In a transverse wave the displacement
is at right angles to the direction in
which the wave is traveling.
●A transverse wave produces a series of
crests and troughs as the wave form is
repeated in a regular cycle. The
wavelength of the wave, denoted by
the symbol , is the horizontal
distance from any point on the cycle
to the analogous point on the next
cycle. This is often conveniently taken
as the distance from one crest to the
next. Altering the size of the crests and
troughs does not alter the wavelength
of the wave.
●Light is an example of a transverse
wave form.
2 Longitudinal waves
●In a longitudinal wave the
displacement is in the same direction
as the direction in which the wave is
traveling.
●A longitudinal wave produces a series
of rarefactions and compressions as
the wave causes particles to move
closer together or further apart in a
regular cycle. The wavelength of the
wave () is the horizontal distance
from any point on the cycle to the
analogous point on the next cycle.
This is often conveniently taken as the
distance from one compression to the
next.
●Sound is an example of a longitudinal
wave form.

1 Relationship between
wave fronts and waves
●A wave front is a line or a surface in
which all points are in the same phase. 
●A point source generates circular wave
fronts while a line source generates
straight wave fronts. The distance
between adjacent wave fronts
corresponds with the wavelength. A
line at right angles to a wave front
which indicates its direction of travel is
called a ray.
2 Huygen’s construction
for a plane progressive
wave
●Huygens proposed a construction
which can be used to explain
reflection, refraction and dispersion of
waves.
●This proposal was based on the idea
that every point on a wave front could
be regarded as a source of secondary
waves which would spread out with
the same velocity as the wave itself.
●A new wave front could therefore be
considered to be the common tangent
of a set of secondary waves. Since all
the secondary waves travel at the same
speed, this tangent would be parallel
to the original wave.
●This construction implies that waves
should also travel in the opposite
direction i.e. backwards. This does not
occur in practice. The assumption is
made that the amplitude of the
secondary waves varies from a
maximum in the direction of travel to
zero in the opposite direction.

Key words
1 Reflection
● Wave front AB approaches the
reflecting surface obliquely. A touches
at A, B at B'.
● Draw an arc (radius BB') centered on
A; draw the tangent to this arc from B'
touching the arc at A'. A is reflected in
the direction AA'.
● In triangles AA'B' and ABB' angle AA'B'
= angle ABB' = 90°; AB' is a common
side; AA' = BB'.
● As the triangles are congruent, the
angles made by the incident wave
front and the reflected wave front with
the reflecting surface are the same—
angle BAB' = angle A'B'A.
● Wave front is at right angles to its
associated ray so angle of incidence, i,
equals angle of reflection, r.
2 Refraction
● Wave front AB approaches the
boundary between two media. Velocity
in 1 is v1; in 2, v2. After t seconds, wave
front is at A'B'.
● If v1 > v2 the refracted ray is bent
towards the normal as shown. If 
v1 < v2 the refracted ray is bent away
from the normal.
● In the triangles BAB' and A'AB'
sin i1/sin i2 = sin BAB'/sin A'B'A =
BB'/AB'÷AA'/AB' = BB' / AA' =
v1t / v2t. Therefore sin i1/sin i2 = v1/v2.
As v1 and v2 are constant for given
media and wavelength, 
sin i1/sin i2 is also constant. Angle i2
(angle of refraction) is normally
represented by r. sin i /sin r =
refractive index. (constant, depending
on media)
3 Optical dispersion
● The value of v1/v2 differs for different
wavelengths (colors). 
● White light is a mixture of different
wavelengths. When passing between
mediums, each wavelength is refracted
by a different amount, dispersing into
separate colors.

Superposition
● A slinky spring is used to show how
waves affect each other.
1 Reinforcement
● When the crest of one wave coincides
with another, they reinforce each
other—they are in phase. The
resulting single crest is the sum of the
two crests.
2 Cancellation
● When the crest of one wave coincides
with the trough of the other, they are
out of phase and cancel each other
out. The result is a straight line if the
crest and the trough are of equal sizes.
3 Addition of two waves
● A wave’s upward displacement is
regarded as positive, downward as
negative. When adding two waves 
(1 and 2) the displacement at any
point (3) is the sum of the
displacements of the two waves at that
point.
4 Interference
● An interference pattern forms when
peaks and troughs of circular waves
formed by point sources (such as S1
and S2) combine.
● Constructive interference occurs
where the waves are in phase with
each other. The waves reinforce each
other forming peaks which are the
sum of the peaks of the waves, and
troughs which are sum of the troughs.
● Destructive interference occurs where
the two waves are out of phase with
each other. The peak of one wave
coincides with the trough of another,
canceling both out. 
● Lines connecting points of
constructive interference (B) and
points of destructive interference (A)
form an alternating sequence in the
interference pattern.

1 Apparatus to produce
stationary waves
●When one end of a rubber cord is
fixed and the other is moved up and
down at regular intervals, using an
electrical vibrator, two progressive
trains of transverse waves travel along
the cord in opposite directions. 
2 “Stroboscopic” view of
stationary waves
●If the frequency with which the cord is
moved up and down is slowly
increased at certain frequencies one or
more high amplitude vibrating loops is
formed. These are called standing
waves or stationary waves—wave
form appears to be frozen and does
not move along the spring in either
direction.
●Points on the stationary wave where
displacement is zero are called nodes
and denoted by N. 
●Within one loop all particles oscillate
in phase but with different
amplitudes.  Points on the stationary
wave where there is maximum
displacement are called antinodes and
denoted by A.
●The frequency of the stationary wave
and the progressive wave is the same
and the wavelength is twice the
distance between successive nodes or
antinodes.
●Increasing the number of nodes and
antinodes by one each time provides a
series of harmonics.
3 Formation of stationary
waves
●When the trains of waves are
completely in phase the result is a
stationary wave with maximum
amplitude equal to twice the
amplitude of the progressive wave.
●When the trains of waves are
completely out of phase (anti-phase)
the result is a stationary wave of zero
amplitude at all i.e. a straight line.

1 Production of a sound
wave
● A vibrating prong displaces adjacent
air molecules, which transfer the
motion to others, forming regular
regions of compression and
rarefaction which creates a sound
wave which passes through the air. 
2 Displacement of air 
molecules forming a wave
● Sound is represented as a transverse
wave whose displacement is
perpendicular to the its direction of
motion.
3 Pressure changes
● Pressure increases where air molecules
crowd together in regions of
compression. Pressure decreases in
regions of rarefaction.
4 Displacement of
individual air molecule
● As a wave passes, air molecules are
displaced in one direction and then in
the other. A graph of this displacement
against time forms a regular transverse
wave form.

1 Demonstrating
rarefaction and
compression regions
●Stationary sound waves can be
obtained in air using Kundt's tube—a
calibrated tube sealed at one end with
a small loudspeaker at the other end.
●The speaker produces progressive
longitudinal waves which travel the
length of the tube. These waves are
reflected back in the opposite
direction and interfere with the
incident waves. 
●The frequency of the sound is varied
until it equals the natural frequency of
vibration of the air column in the tube;
resonance occurs as a standing wave
forms in the tube. This is displayed
using lycopodium powder, which
swirls away from the antinodes, where
the air particles are vibrating most
strongly and forms heaps at the nodes. 
2 Displacement and
pressure graphs
●In a stationary longitudinal wave the
maximum pressure variation occurs at
a displacement node and is zero at a
displacement antinode—i.e.
displacement nodes correspond with
pressure antinodes and vice versa.
3 Formation of beats
●Beats occur when two notes of slightly
different frequencies but similar
amplitude sound together. Beat
frequency is the difference in
frequency between the two notes.
Beat period is its reciprocal. 
●Superposition of the waves can explain
beats. Sound is loudest when the
waves are almost completely in phase,
and quietest when the waves are
almost completely out of phase.

1 Tuning fork
●When a tuning fork is struck the
prongs vibrate at a fixed
predetermined frequency. The
simultaneous vibrations produced by
the prongs can be used to
demonstrate how waves superimpose.
2 Spread of sound from a
vibrating tuning fork
●When the prongs are moving away
from each other a rarefaction is
produced in the air particles between
them. This rarefaction travels in the
direction Y and Y’. Simultaneously,
compressions are produced outside
the prongs and these travel in the
directions X and X’. 
●When the prongs are moving towards
each other a compression is produced
in the air particles between them. This
compression travels in the direction Y
and Y’. Simultaneously, rarefactions are
produced outside the prongs and
these travel in the directions X and X’. 
●Whenever a rarefaction or
compression occurs in the directions Y
and Y’, the opposite occurs in the
directions X and X’. The rarefactions
and compressions spread out from the
tuning fork as spherical waves and
destructive interference occurs along
the lines A, B, C and D.
●If the tuning fork is held upright close
to the ear and slowly rotated about a
vertical axis, the sound is lost four
times in each revolution. This
corresponds to when the tuning fork
is in positions A, B, C and D, where
the two waves are out of phase and
cancel each other out.

Key words
1 Ripple tank
●Wave behavior can be studied by
observing water waves in a ripple
tank—a shallow tank of water. Regular
vibrations are produced using a low
voltage motor attached to a wooden
beam. The beam can make straight
waves and, by attaching dippers,
curved waves.  
●The wave patterns can be “frozen”
using a stroboscopic light so they can
be observed and measured more
easily.
2 Reflected straight waves
●Straight waves are reflected by a
barrier. The angle of incidence equals
the angle of reflection. The frequency
of the incident and reflected waves is
the same.
3 Reflected curved waves
●The curvature of curved waves is
reversed on reflection by a straight
barrier, their frequency is unchanged.
4 Refracted waves
●When water waves pass into shallower
water they are refracted.
5 Interference
●Interference patterns can be formed
using a pair of dippers to produce
circular waves of the same frequency
simultaneously. The pattern shows
regions of constructive interference,
where the waves are completely in
phase, and regions of destructive
interference where the waves are
completely out of phase.
6 Diffraction
●Waves spread on passing through an
opening or around an object. This is
called diffraction.
● Maximum diffraction occurs when
waves pass through a gap whose size
equals the wavelength of the waves.

Key words
Seismic waves
●Seismic waves are vibrations caused by
movement inside Earth which
manifests itself as an earthquake.
There are two types of seismic waves.
1 P wave
●P (primary) waves are longitudinal
waves which shake the ground in the
direction that the wave is traveling.
Their speed depends on the nature of
the rock through which they are
traveling. A typical value is 6 km/s.
2 S wave
●S (shear) waves are transverse waves
which shake the ground in directions
perpendicular to the direction of
travel. S waves travel more slowly than
P waves. A typical value is 4 km/s.
3 Seismograph
●Earthquakes are recorded on a
seismograph. When the ground shakes
the base and frame of the instrument
move with it, but the pendulum bob,
due to its high inertia, does not.
Movement is recorded as seismogram.
●Earthquake severity is measured on
the logarithmic Richter scale. A
magnitude 5 earthquake is thus ten
times more severe than a magnitude 4
earthquake.

1 Estimating distance from
earthquake’s epicenter
●The ratio between the average speed
of a P wave and its following S wave is
reasonably constant. It enables
seismologists to estimate the distance
to an earthquake from an observation
station.
●The further an observation post is
from the epicenter of an earthquake,
the longer the time gap between the
arrival of P waves and then S waves. 
●Taking typical values of 6 km/s for 
P waves and 4 km/s for S waves, the
distance from an observation station to
the epicenter is given by:
Distance (km) = time between the
arrival of P waves and S waves x 12
●The distance to the epicenter can also
be estimated from a graph of time
difference against distance.
2 Estimating position of
earthquake’s epicenter
●The time gap between the arrival of 
P waves and S waves at an observation
station indicates that the epicenter of
an earthquake is at a distance d
kilometers from station but gives no
information about its direction. The
epicenter of the earthquake could lie
anywhere on a circle radius d from
the observation station.
●In order to fix the position of the
epicenter of an earthquake it is
necessary to use information from
three observation stations. If a circle is
drawn from each observation station at
a radius corresponding to the distance
from the epicenter its position is at the
point where the circles intersect.

Musical notes 
amplitude
frequency
fundamental
harmonic
Key words
1 Waveform
●Musical instruments produce a range
of notes, often due to vibrating strings
or vibrating columns of air. The same
note played on different musical
instruments sounds different because,
unlike a tuning fork, musical
instruments do not produce pure
notes.
●A musical instrument produces a
fundamental frequency together with
a series of overtones at lower
amplitudes. The fundamental has the
lowest frequency and the overtones
have frequencies that are multiples of
this fundamental.
●The number and amplitudes of the
overtones determine the quality of the
sound and are typical of the particular
musical instrument thus middle “C” on
a violin sounds different from the
same note played on a piano.
●The fundamental frequency is also
called the first harmonic. If this is
equal to f then the overtones have
frequencies of 2f, 3f, 4f, etc. They are
called the second harmonic, third
harmonic, fourth harmonic and so on.
2 Waveform of 440 Hz
note
●It is possible to analyse the frequencies
and amplitudes of the harmonics
which combine to produce a note on a
musical instrument.
●When a note of frequency 440 Hz is
played on a violin and a piano the
mixture of harmonics is very different. 
3 Frequency spectrum of
440 Hz note
●The amplitude of the second and fifth
harmonics on the violin is much
higher than the corresponding
harmonics on the piano. This
difference contributes significantly to
the different sound of this note on the
two instruments.

Key words
1 Stringed instruments
●These produce sound forming
longitudinal waves as their strings are
plucked, stroked or struck, causing
them to vibrate. 
●Progressive transverse waves travel
from both fixed ends of the string, so
reflected waves meet incident waves. A
stationary wave forms when the
stationary wave pattern fits the length
of the string in terms of wavelengths. 
●A progressive longitudinal sound wave
of the same frequency forms in air
surrounding the stationary transverse
wave on the string.
●The sound produced by vibrating
strings has low amplitude. It is
transmitted by the strings to the
hollow body of the instrument (cello,
guitar) or to the sounding board
(piano) where it is amplified by
causing vibration in a surrounding air.
2 First harmonic 
●The fixed ends of a string are
displacement nodes, N.  
●The simplest stationary wave occurs
whith one displacement antinode
between the fixed ends. This happens
when the string is plucked at its center.
● The distance between the nodes is half
a wavelength (/2). 
● The vibration creates the fundamental
frequency, or first harmonic.
● The frequency of a note, f = n/, (n is
the speed of the transverse wave along
the string).
3 Second harmonic
●The string can vibrate in two parts if
plucked one quarter along its length—
there are two half wavelengths.
This is the second harmonic. 
4 Third harmonic
●The next harmonic is obtained when
the string vibrates in three parts—
there are three half wavelengths. This
is the third harmonic.

Vibrating columns of air
●Sound is produced in wind
instruments by stationary 
longitudinal waves formed in air
columns inside pipes. 
●Vibration starts with a disturbance at
one end of the pipe, the other end of
the pipe may be closed or open.
1 Harmonics produced by a
closed pipe
●The simplest stationary wave in a
closed pipe has a displacement node
(N) at the closed end and an antinode
(A) at the open end.
●The distance between the node and
antinode is 1⁄4 the wavelength, 1, of
the stationary wave. 
●The frequency; f, of a note = n/ (n is
the speed of sound in air).
●If the pipe is of length, l, then 1 = 4l;
f1 = n/4l. This is the fundamental
frequency or first harmonic.
●The next stationary wave occurs when
another node and antinode are added.
For this note 2 = 4l/3; f2 = 3n/4l. This
is the second harmonic.
● For the next stationary wave  
3 = 4l/5; f3 = 5n/4l. This is the third
harmonic.
● Closed pipes give only odd-numbered
harmonics.
2 Harmonics produced by
an open pipe
●The simplest stationary wave in an
open pipe has a displacement node
(N) in the center and an antinode (A)
at each end.
●If the pipe is of length l, then 1 = 2l;
f1 = n/2l. This is the fundamental
frequency or first harmonic.
●The next stationary wave occurs when
another node and antinode are added.
For this note 2 = l; f2 = n/l. This is
the second harmonic.
●For the next stationary wave 3 = 2l/3;
f3 = 3n/2l. This is the third harmonic.

Resonance
●All objects have a natural frequency at
which they vibrate. The vibration can
be started and increased by another
object vibrating at the same frequency.
This effect is called resonance.
1 Pendulum resonance
●A heavy metal ball is set swinging as a
pendulum forcing the lighter weights
to swing. The light weight whose
length matches the pendulum’s has a
much greater amplitude than the rest.
This weight resonates with the
pendulum.
2 Wire resonance
●The length of a stretched wire is
altered until it vibrates at the same
frequency as the tuning fork. At this
frequency the amplitude of the wire’s
vibrations increase dislodging the
paper rider. The wire resonates with
the tuning fork.
3 Air resonance
●The length of the air column is altered
by moving the tube up and down until
it vibrates with the same frequency as
the tuning fork, and the sound of the
vibrating fork is amplified. The air
column resonates with the tuning fork.
4 Destructive resonance
●If large structures such as tall towers
and suspended bridges start to vibrate
at their natural frequencies the results
can be disastrous.
●The collapse of the Tacoma Narrows
Bridge, USA in 1940 is well-known. It is
thought that the bridge began to
resonate due to a cross wind of a
particular frequency. This caused the
bridge to shake itself apart. 
●Models of large structures are tested in
wind tunnels to ensure that their
natural vibrating frequencies are
outside the range of vibrations caused
by winds.

Scales
●As music developed it became obvious
that some combinations of notes of
certain frequencies gave pleasing
results while others did not. The
results of these observations gave rise
to musical scales.
1 Keyboard scale
●Music evolved along different lines in
different parts of the world and scales
were adopted accordingly. In Europe,
music came to be based on the
diatonic scale. This consists of eight
notes and can be shown in a variety 
of ways.
●For scientific purposes the diatonic
scale has been standardised as a
sequence of notes between middle C
(c´) and upper C (c´´). Middle C has
the frequency 256 Hz while upper C
has the frequency 512 Hz. Scientific
tuning forks pitched at these two
notes are however, not suitable for
tuning musical instruments.
●As far as music is concerned the ratio
of the pitches of the various notes on
the scale is more important than the
actual pitch of the notes. In the
eighteenth century it would be
unlikely to find two organs, for
example, with middle C pipes of
exactly the same pitch but this did not
create a problem provided the ratios
between the notes was the same for all
instruments.
●In 1939 an international committee
agreed to standardise absolute pitch
based on the note middle A at 440 Hz.
2 Frequencies (scientific)
●Certain intervals have been given
specific names. A ratio of 9:8 is a major
tone, 10:9 is a minor tone and 16:15 a
semitone. The interval between the
top and bottom notes of a scale is 2:1
and is called an octave.

Key words
1 Ear
●The outer ear consists of the pinna
and the outer ear canal which collect
and channel sound to the tympanic
membrane (eardrum) causing it to
vibrate in and out. 
●The middle ear, separated from the
outer ear by the tympanic membrane
and from the inner ear by the oval
window and round window, contains
tiny bones or ossicles called the
malleus (hammer), incus (anvil) and
stapes (stirrup). These are the smallest
bones in the body and are held in
place by muscle and ligament. The
ossicles transfer and magnify sound
from the tympanic membrane to the
oval window.
●The eustachian tube connects the
middle ear to the pharynx. It ensures
equal air pressure on both sides of the
tympanic membrane.
●The outer and middle ear are air-filled.
The inner ear is fluid-filled and
contains the semicircular canals,
concerned with balance and the
cochlea, concerned with hearing.
2 Cochlea
●The cochlea consists of three parallel
canals separated by membranes. The
basilar membrane separates the
middle and tympanic canals. The
tectorial membrane runs parallel with
the basilar membrane the full length of
the cochlea.
3 Receptor cells
●There is a series of receptor cells
between the tectorial and basilar
membranes. A sensory hair on one
end of each cell touches the tectorial
membrane while the other end is
connected to a nerve fiber.
●Movement of the basilar membrane
causes distortions of the receptor
cells, resulting in impulses being sent
to the brain along the auditory
nerves.

1 Audio range comparison
●Human beings can only hear sounds
in the range 20–20,000 Hz. These are
called the limits of audibility and
decrease with age. Humans usually
lose the ability to hear sounds at the
high-frequency end of the range as
they grow older.
●Many animals hear sound over a
different range than humans. For
example, bats are able to detect
sounds at much higher frequencies
than humans. They use short bursts of
high-pitched sound to locate flying
insects.
2 Sensitivity of human
hearing
● Although the limits of audibility for a
human are 20–20,000 Hz this does not
mean that the human ear can detect
sound equally well at all frequencies
over the whole range. The human ear
is most sensitive in the range
1000–10,000 Hz.
● Sounds below the lower limit of
audibility i.e. <20 Hz, are called
infrasound. Such sounds are too low
to be detected by the ear but the
vibrations might still be detected by
the body.
● Sounds above upper limit of audibility
i.e. > 20,000 Hz, are called
ultrasound. Ultrasound has a variety
of uses in industry and in medicine.

Key words
1 Infrasound
●The frequency of infrasound (typically
20 Hz down to 0.001 Hz) is too low to
be detected by the human ear. It can
cover long distances and negotiate
obstacles with little dissipation.
●Infrasound may result from natural
phenomena—ocean waves,
avalanches, earthquakes, volcanoes,
and meteors—and be detected by
seismographs. Infrasound is also
generated by some man-made
processes such as explosions.
●Some animals use infrasound to
communicate over varying distances of
up to many miles. Migrating birds may
use naturally generated infrasound,
from sources such as turbulent airflow
over mountain ranges, as a
navigational aid.
2 Sonar
●The frequency of ultrasound (greater
than 20,000 Hz). is too high to be
detected by the human ear. Sonar
uses ultrasound to build up a “picture”
of the surroundings. 
3 Animal sonar
●Animals such as bats, whales and
dolphins also use ultrasound for
navigation. 
4 Medical ultrasound
●Ultrasound travels at a different speeds
in different substances. Some is
reflected when passing from one
substance to another, and it can be
detected. The bigger the speed
difference, the greater the reflection.
●Ultrasound is used in hospitals to
produce pictures of the inside of the
body. Such scans are often performed
to observe the unborn baby. 
●Saline gel prevents the formation of a
layer of air between probe and skin,
allowing more ultrasound to enter the
body without reflection. This allows
formation of a good image.

Key words
Noise and decibel ratings
●The human ear responds to the ratio
of the power of sounds rather than the
difference in power. To the ear, a
change of loudness from 0.1 W to 1 W
is the same as from 1 W to 10
therefore the logarithm to base 10
(log10) of these changes is the same. 
●The unit used to measure change in
power is the bel, B. If the power of
sound changes from P1 to P2 then
number of bels change = log10(P2/P1)
●The bel is too large for practical use so
in practice the decibel is used. number
of decibels change = 10 log10(P2/P1)
●The decibel scale is logarithmic, thus
an increase from 10 dB to 20 dB
corresponds to a tenfold increase in
the power of the sound. 
●Noise-induced hearing loss may result
from a single very loud noise or
frequent exposure to loud noise.
●Loud noise damages the sensory hairs
in the cochlea either temporarily or
permanently depending on the
loudness of the noise and the amount
of exposure.
●Sounds less than 80 dB are unlikely to
cause permanent hearing loss. Regular
exposure to noise above 85 dB will
cause a gradual hearing loss and
louder noises accelerate this loss.
●For unprotected ears, allowed
exposure time decreases by one-half
for each 5 dB increase in average noise
level. Exposure time is limited to 8
hours at 90 dB, 4 hours at 95 dB, and 2
hours at 100 dB. The highest
permissible noise exposure for the
unprotected ear is 115 dB for 15
minutes each day.
● Sound frequency is measured in hertz,
Hz. The human ear can detect sound
in the range 20–20,000 Hz. Human
speech is in the range 300–4000 Hz.
When a person becomes deaf, higher
frequency sounds are lost first.

1 Relation between wave
velocity and tension in a
wire
●A tuning fork vibrates when struck. If a
tuning fork’s base is placed on the
wire of a sonometer, the wire vibrates.
●The vibrating wire’s frequency
depends on its length, which is varied
by moving the bridge until it equals
the tuning fork’s frequency. 
●Resonance occurs between the tuning
fork and the string and the paper rider
is thrown off the string.
●The speed of a transverse wave
traveling along a stretched wire, 
n = (T/m) where T = tension and m
= mass per unit length.
●For a vibrating wire of length l, the
frequency of the fundamental note, 
f = n /2l, it follows that 
f = (T/m) / 2l
●f is therefore inversely proportional to
l when T and m are constant.
f is also proportional to the square
root of T when l and m are constant.
2 Speed of sound
measurement
●A tuning fork is struck and held over a
tube standing in a large glass jar which
is slowly raised and lowered until the
note’s sound is loudest, showing
resonance between the tuning fork
and the air column in the tube. The
stationary wave in the air column is
one quarter of  the note’s wavelength.
Therefore l1 + x = /4 (l1 is the length
of the tube above the water level; x is
the end correction).
●When the tube is raised further using
the same tuning fork a second
resonance position is found,
corresponding to an air column three
quarters of a wavelength. l2 + x =
3/4.
●Thus l2–l1 = /2. The frequency, f, of
the tuning fork is known, the speed of
sound in air, n = f.

rarefaction
Key words
1 Speed of sound in a
metal rod
●The method provides an approximate
value for the speed of sound as it
passes through steel.
●The output from a signal generator
becomes the input of a cathode ray
oscilloscope (CRO) when the hammer
strikes the lower rod. 
●A compression pulse passes along the
rod and is reflected at the left end of
the steel rod as a rarefaction pulse.
This wave passes back towards the
right end of the steel rod where it
breaks the contact between the rod
and the hammer.
●If the frequency of the signal is 
25,000 Hz and there are 10 complete
oscillations on the CRO it follows that
the steel bar and the hammer must
have been in contact for 
10/25,000 = 4 x 10-4 s = 400 ms.
During this time the wave has traveled
twice the length of the steel bar which
is 2 m. The speed of sound in steel is
therefore 2 / 4 x 10-4 = 5,000 ms-1.
2 Speed of a mechanical
wave
●The trolleys are linked by springs. 
●The trolleys are pushed together
towards the metal block. The left-most
trolley stops when it hits the metal
block, completing the circuit. The
compression pulse passes from trolley
to trolley as each spring in turn is
compressed. The right-most trolley
then starts to move to the right
initiating an expansion pulse. Each
spring expands in turn until the left-
most trolley moves and the circuit is
broken.
●The scaler records the length of time
taken for the pulse to pass twice the
distance from the front of the left-most
trolley to the back of the right-most
trolley. If this distance is measured the
speed of the mechanical wave can be
calculated.

●Ends of waves passing through a

Curvature is greatest when the gap is

2 Young’s double-slit
experiment
●A wave passing through two slits
produces two coherent waves of the
same frequency, equal or similar
magnitude and a constant phase
difference. An interference pattern
forms when coherent waves cross.
3 Observing interference
fringes
●Monochromatic light from a narrow
slit falling on two slits (close together
and parallel to the first slit) forms two
coherent light sources. Diffraction
occurs if the pair of slits is sufficiently
narrow. A pattern of equally alternate
bright and dark vertical bands, or
interference fringes forms. Bright
bands indicate where the waves are in
phase and hence at maximum
amplitude. Dark bands indicate where
the waves are out of phase and
amplitude is zero.
4 Path difference in
Young’s experiment
●A bright fringe occurs if the path
difference from the slits equals a
whole number of wavelengths (apart
from the central bright fringe).
●The first bright fringe occurs at k, a
distance x above the central bright
fringe. The path difference of light
reaching k from S1 and S2 is S2A.
Sin 1 = S2A/d. Sin  = x/D. As d is
very small relative to D, 1 = . A bright
fringe appears when the path
difference is n. Therefore, for the first
fringe (n=1), /d = x/D;  = xd/D

Key words
1 Fresnel’s biprism
●When monochromatic light falls on a
small-angled prism two virtual images
are formed by refraction at each half
of the prism. This gives the effect of
three light sources, one real and two
imaginary. These act as coherent
sources which are close together due
to the small refracting angle. 
●An interference pattern, similar to that
from a double slit but brighter, is
obtained where the two refracted
beams overlap. The pattern can
conveniently observed using a
traveling eyepiece focused on the
fringes.
2 Fresnel’s mirrors
●When two mirrors are inclined at a
very small angle to each other they
produce two virtual sources of light
from one real monochromatic source.
The light from the two virtual sources
is coherent.
●The two reflected beams appear to
come from two closely-spaced virtual
sources. They interfere with each
other and producing an interference
pattern of bright and dark fringes.
3 Lloyd’s mirror
●Lloyd's mirror may also be used to
demonstrate interference. Light from a
monochromatic slit source reflects
from a glass surface set at a small angle
from the horizontal. The result is that
light also appears to come from a
second virtual source. The light from
the real and virtual sources is coherent
and an interference pattern of fringes
is formed.

coherent waves which interfere when
brought together.
2 Path difference between

●Path length difference between rays,

●The waves are coherent and

3 Interference fringes in a

●Interference fringes are produced by a
thin wedge of air. 
●When monochromatic light shines
onto the glass plates some is reflected
up by the lower surface of the top
plate and some, transmitted through
the air, is reflected up by the upper
surface of the bottom plate. Both
waves originate from the same point,
they are coherent and interfere when
brought together.
4 Newton’s rings
●Monochromatic light is reflected by a
glass slide and falls on the film of air
between a plano-convex lens and an
optical flat. To each side of the center
of the lens there is a wedge of air
gradually increasing in thickness from
zero moving outwards. 
●Light reflected by the lower surface of
the lens and by the upper surface of
the optical flat create interference
fringes which take the form of rings.
As their radii increase, the spacing
between them decreases.

Key words
1 Diffraction pattern
●Diffraction results from superposition
of waves from different parts of the
same wave front, while interference
results from superposition of waves on
two different wave fronts. 
●Monochromatic light passes through a
horizontal source slit and then a
horizontal diffracting slit. A diffraction
pattern is formed on the screen.
2 Wave fronts and
interference
●A horizontal slit can be thought of a
series of vertical strips, each being a
source of secondary wavelets. The
wavelets can be added using the
principle of superposition. 
3 Angular width of central
maximum
●First dark band forms at ° to  incident
beam, if path difference for secondary
wavelets from strip C, immediately
below A is /2. Destructive
interference occurs between these
wavelets, causing darkness in direction
 when CD = /2. 
● Since sin  = 2CD / a, sin  = /a.
4 Position of next
minimum
●sin  = n /a where n = 1, 2, etc.
corresponding to pairs of dark bands
on either side of the original direction
of the incident beam.
5 Intensity distribution
●From sin  = /a, if a (slit width) is
much larger than  (wavelength),
angle  is very small and the dark
bands will be very close to the central
maximum. Most of the emergent light
from the slit will be in the direction of
the incident light and minimal
diffraction occurs.
If a = ; sin  = 1; therefore  = 90°.
The width of the central band is twice
that of any other bright band.

Key words
1 Observing diffraction
from a double slit
●If slits are sufficiently narrow,
diffraction occurs and each slit acts as
a source of secondary wavelets which
superimpose on each other. In some
directions there is constructive
interference resulting in bright bands
while in others there is destructive
interference resulting in dark bands.
●In addition to interference occurring
between wavelets from different slits,
it also occurs between wavelets
produced by the same slit. The
wavelets formed at each slit each form
a diffraction pattern. These patterns
are similar in nature and traveling in
the same direction so they will
coincide if focused by a lens.
2 Intensity pattern
●Interference produces a regular
pattern of dark and bright bands of
similar intensity. 
●Diffraction at one slit produces a
central bright band which is twice the
width of the series of other less bright
bands on either side of it.
●The two patterns come together to
form a resultant intensity distribution.
3 Altering slit width
●The number of interference fringes
formed depends on the amount of
diffraction that occurs at each slit
which, in turn, depends on the width
of the slits. The narrower the slits the
greater the number of fringes due to
increased diffraction. However, since
the slits are narrow, less light gets
through and the fringes become
fainter.
●In practice, in order to generate
fringes which are easily seen, it is
necessary to have slits which are many
wavelengths wide.

1 Diffraction and
construction of intensity
pattern
●A diffraction grating consists of many
evenly spaced equally sized fine
parallel slits. A series of light and dark
interference fringes forms when
monochromatic light falls on the
grating. A diffraction pattern also
forms at each slit.
2 Intensity pattern
●Light and dark bands formed by
interference and diffraction combine
forming an intensity pattern.
3 Formation of spectral
lines by a grating
●Diffraction gratings are used to
produce spectra for very accurate
measurement of wavelength. They are
frequently preferred to prisms because
they give very sharp spectra.
●Consider plane waves of
monochromatic light, wavelength ,
falling on a diffraction grating, whose
slits are separated by distance, d,
(grating spacing). For wavelets coming
from two adjacent slits and traveling at
angle  to the direction of the incident
light, the path difference between
them corresponding to one
wavelength will be dsin . This is true
of corresponding pairs of adjacent
slits. In the general case for all such
waves dsin   = n , where n gives the
order of the spectrum, and
reinforcement of diffracted wavelets
occurs in direction . Intensity is
greatest when the wavelets are
focused by a lens.
●If light of mixed wavelengths falls onto
the diffraction grating  is different for
each, corresponding to the difference
in wavelength. The angle at which
reinforcement of diffracted wavelets
occurs is different for each
wavelength, thus light of different
wavelengths is separated.

Key words
Resolution
●Resolution is the ability of an optical
system to form distinct separate
images of objects that are close
together. Resolving power depends on
the size of hole or slit through which
objects are viewed and the color of the
light. It is easier to resolve an object
which is illuminated by short
wavelength light (blue) than by long
wavelength light (red).
1 Formation of diffraction
images
●Resolving power also depends on the
distance between objects. When two
slit sources form diffraction images
resolution depends on the angle
subtended by the sources at the slit.
2 Diffraction images of two
slit sources
●As the angle subtended at the slit by
the two sources decreases so does the
resolution of their diffraction images.
●Rayleigh suggested objects should be
considered to be just resolved when
the first minimum of one image
coincides with the central maximum of
the other image. If slit width equals b
then  = /b. As the wavelength of
light decreases so  decreases.
●Assuming the pupil of the human eye
is 2 x 10-3 m and the average
wavelength of white light is 6 x 10-7 m
the resolving power of the eye is 
6 x 10-7 / 2 x 10-3 = 3 x 10-4 radians.
3 Resolving power of a
microscope
●In a microscope the lens acts as a
circular aperture. 
●The Rayleigh criterion for a circular
aperture is sin  = 1.22  / d where 
is the angle subtended by the images,
 is the wavelength of light and d is
the diameter of the aperture.

1 Demonstration
●Polarization shows that light waves
are transverse in character.
●A lamp viewed through a Polaroid
appears normal although dimmer.
Rotating the Polaroid has no effect.  
●If the lamp is viewed through two
Polaroids and one is slowly rotated, a
position is reached where light is
completely blocked off. If the rotation
is continued the light is restored.
2 Analogy
●Vibrations in light waves occur in all
directions perpendicular to the
direction of travel.
●A Polaroid acts like a slit, allowing only
waves vibrating in one direction to
pass. No waves pass if a second slit is
placed perpendicular to the first.
3 Nicol prism
●A Nicol prism consists of Icelandic
spar, a form of calcite.
●An unpolarized ray of light passing
through a Nicol prism splits into an
ordinary and an extraordinary ray—
polarized at right angles to each other.
The extraordinary ray is transmitted. 
4 Polarization by reflection
●Light reflected by glass or water is
partially plane polarized. At the
polarizing angle, ip, an unpolarized ray
of light splits into two plane polarized
rays. One is reflected, the other is
refracted.
5 Sheets of glass
●When light falls on glass plates,
separated by thin layers of air, the
reflected light rays are plane polarized
transmitted rays are partly polarized.
6 Scattering
●Light rays are scattered by collisions
with particles in cloudy water, this
results in rays of plane polarized light.

1 Light rays resolved into

●Many sources produce unpolarized
light. Rays vibrate perpendicularly to
the direction traveled by the ray.
●Unpolarized light can be represented
by arrows whose direction
corresponds to the direction of
vibration. Dots represent arrows going
into and out of the page.
●Any vibration can be resolved into two
perpendicular components.
2 Light and
electromagnetism
●Visible light is part of the
electromagnetic spectrum. It is
regarded as a combination of varying
electric and magnetic fields at right
angles to each other.  
●Light vibrations are taken to be
variations of the electric field.  
●Polaroid consists of tiny crystals
aligned in the same direction on a
nitrocellulose sheet. The crystals
polarize light by selective absorption.
●The effect is similar to the
polarization of microwaves by a grid
of wires.
3 Parallel and crossed
tourmaline crystals
●The mineral tourmaline also polarizes
light by selective absorption. Two
wafers placed in parallel produce
polarized light. If one of the wafers is
rotated through 90° no light passes.
4 Nicol prisms used as
polarizer and analyzer
●When Nicol prisms are placed in
parallel, polarized light is transmitted
through them. When the same prisms
are placed in the “crossed” position
the polarized light transmitted by the
first is absorbed by the second and
there is no overall transmission.

1 Fizeau’s rotating wheel
●A ray of light is reflected by a glass
plate, passes between the teeth of the
wheel to a distant mirror and is
reflected back. When the wheel is
rotating slowly the light returns in
time to pass through the opening
through which it was transmitted. As
the speed of rotation increases, the
light is blocked when the wheel has
advanced half the distance between
adjacent gaps. As the speed increases,
the wheel advances the whole distance
between adjacent gaps and the light
will again pass through.
●As the distances, the wheel’s speed of
rotation when light was transmitted,
and its speed when light was blocked
were known, Fizeau could calculate
the speed of light.  
2 Michelson’s rotating
prism
●Light passes through a slit and is
reflected by one side of a prism. After
reflection by a plane mirror, it is
reflected between a pair of concave
mirrors. The returning beam is
reflected at the opposite side of the
prism and, after reflection, viewed.  
●When the prism is stationary, the
image is seen by light reflected from
surface A
I. As the prism rotates, the
image disappears, but it reappears
when the rotation speed increases,
and is seen in the same position as
when the prism is stationary. Light
reflected from A now arrives at A
I in
the time taken by the prism to rotate
through 45° or 1⁄8 of a revolution.
3 Foucault’s method
●Light is reflected by rotating plane
mirrors onto a pair of concave mirrors
set an equal distance away. The
difference in the speed of light in air
and in water is shown by the different
time taken for the light beams to be
reflected back to the eyepiece.

Key words
1 Electromagnetic radiation
●The electromagnetic spectrum
consists of a series of wave-like
radiations which carry energy and
exhibit interference and diffraction. 
●Because of their electrical origin and
ability to travel in a vacuum, they are
regarded as a combination of electric
and magnetic forces (hence the name)
directed at right angles to each other
and to the direction of travel.
2 Electromagnetic
spectrum
●The electromagnetic spectrum is
divided into a series of regions on the
basis of wavelength or frequency. 
●For all electromagnetic radiation:
speed in a vacuum = 
wavelength x frequency
c = 
●Since speed in a vacuum is constant,
the frequency of electromagnetic
radiation increases as wavelength
decreases and vice versa.
●The energy of electromagnetic
radiation increases with its frequency
thus gamma rays are the most
energetic and able to pass through
thick layers of solid materials.
3 Light waves
●The visible spectrum of light is part of
the electromagnetic spectrum. The
colors of the spectrum correspond to
the colors of the rainbow: red, orange,
yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet,
although there is some dispute over
whether indigo and violet are
sufficiently different in appearance to
justify being regarded as different
colors.
●What makes light of one color
different from light of another color is
its wavelength. Red light has the
longest wavelength (and therefore the
lowest frequency) while violet light has
the shortest wavelength (and highest
frequency).

Key words
Gamma rays
●Gamma radiation is emitted as a result
of radioactive decay. Gamma rays have
high energy and are the most
penetrating and least ionising of the
three radiations emitted in
radioactivity.
X-rays
●X-rays are produced in X-ray tubes by
the impact of high speed electrons on
metal targets. 
●High frequency X-rays can penetrate
solid objects. Longer wavelength X-rays
can penetrate flesh but not bone. They
are used to obtain “pictures” of bones
and teeth inside the body.
Ultraviolet waves
●Ultraviolet radiation is emitted by
white-hot objects (such as the Sun)
and from certain gas discharges. 
●This radiation gives rise to
fluorescence and photoelectric effects.
It causes the skin to tan and is used in
the formation of vitamin D.
Infrared waves
●Infrared radiation is thermal radiation
(heat). All bodies emit infrared
radiation and it is one means of
transferring heat.
●Infrared is used to transfer data
between IT equipment without cables.
Microwaves
●Microwave sources include tubes
called klystrons. 
●Microwaves are used in radar and in
microwave ovens to cook food.
Radio waves
●Radio waves are important in
communication. Information is added
to the wave before transmisson. At the
receiver the information is separated
from the carrier wave and amplified.
Tests indicate that, according to average judgement, names for the pure spectral colors
should be applied to light of the following wavelenghts

Key words
1 Intensity of filament lamp
●Light sources emit both light and heat.
When radiation from a filament lamp
is dispersed by a prism, infrared
radiation is refracted less than visible
light and can be detected beyond the
red end of the spectrum.
2 The thermopile
●When two different metals are joined
in a circuit with their junctions kept at
different temperatures, a small e.m.f. is
produced and a current flows.
●Several thermocouples connected in
series form a thermopile.
●Hot junctions of a thermopile are
painted dull black to increase heat
absorption, while the cold junctions
are shielded from the heat radiation.
3 The bolometer
●A small temperature change causes a
large change in the electrical
resistance of a thermistor.  
●A bolometer contains one active and
one compensating thermistor in a
Wheatstone bridge circuit. Change in
temperature alters the active
thermistor’s resistance, unbalancing
the potential difference. The required
rebalancing relates to the size of the
temperature change.  
4 Black body radiation
●A black body theoretically absorbs all
the radiation falling on it. It is a
standard to judge other bodies by.
●A cylinder with dull black interior
surfaces and a small hole through
which radiation enters approximates
to a black body. Radiation entering is
absorbed before exiting.
●Wien’s displacement law states that at
a temperature, the wavelength of the
majority of the energy radiated has a
particular wavelength max. This
wavelength decreases with rising
temperature maxT = constant.

Key words
1 Scattering by particles
●Some light passing through a tube
containing particles collides and is
reflected in several directions, whilst
the remainder passes straight through.
2 Absorption of light by
solids
●Different substances absorb light of
different wavelengths.  
●Light which has passed through a
sample can be separated into a series
of rays of different wavelengths by
diffraction and be displayed as a
spectrograph.
3 Iodine vapor
fluorescence
●A spectrograph records the
wavelengths of light absorbed by
iodine vapor.
4 Reflection and scattering
●The nature of scattering depends on
the size of the particles involved.
5 Rayleigh scattering
●Rayleigh scattering is the effect where
light is scattered by particles smaller
than the wavelength of light. It is most
prominent in gases.  
●Such particles scatter more short than
long wavelength light. The wavelength
of blue light is around 400 nm, red
light around 700 nm.  
●Nitrogen and oxygen molecules cause
Rayleigh scattering. Blue light is
scattered about 10 times more than
red. When the sun is overhead blue
light is scattered many times before it
reaches our eyes so the sky appears
uniformly blue. Red light is scattered
relatively little and so appears to be
coming only from the sun.
●At sunrise and sunset, sunlight travels
through a thicker atmospheric layer
causing increased scattering of red
light which can make the sky appear
redder.

1 Dispersion curves
●The refractive index, , of a medium
is the ratio of the speed of light in that
medium to the speed of light in a
second medium (often air).
●The change in speed of
electromagnetic radiation passing
from one medium into another
depends on its wavelength. When a
mixture of radiations of different
wavelengths, such as white light,
passes from air into a glass prism it
separates into its component
wavelengths.
2 Anomalous dispersion of
sodium vapor
●Sodium vapor is formed by heating
sodium metal in a sealed tube. Light is
polarised using a horizontal slit before
passing through the vapor. 
●A sequence of images of the horizontal
slit separated by gaps forms. The
radiation bands are detected by a
spectroscope.
3 Anomalous dispersion of
quartz in infrared
●Over a short range of wavelengths
quartz absorbs all radiation and
refracts none.
4 Dispersion curve for
material transparent to
light
●Dispersion occurs in all regions of the
electromagnetic spectrum.
●Higher frequency components of light
passing through a normally dispersive
medium travel slower than lower
frequency components. The light
becomes positively chirped, or up-
chirped, increasing in frequency with
time. Higher frequency components of
light passing through an anomalously
dispersive medium travel faster than
low ones, the pulse becomes
negatively chirped, or down chirped,
decreasing in frequency with time.

Key words
1 Reflection of light rays
from polished surface
●When parallel light rays fall on a highly
polished surface they are reflected as a
parallel beam. This is described as
regular reflection. The angle of
reflection of each ray equals the angle
of incidence.
2 Reflection of light rays
from rough surface
●Most surfaces are not totally smooth,
therefore light is reflected in many
different directions. This is diffuse
reflection. Although light rays are
reflected in different directions each
individual ray obeys the laws of
reflection; its angle of reflection equals
its angle of incidence.
3 Verifying law of
reflection
●The angle of incidence is the angle
between the incident light ray and the
normal. The angle of reflection is the
angle between the reflected ray and
the normal.  
●The first law of reflection states that
the angle of reflection equals the angle
of incidence.
●The second law of reflection states
that the angle of incidence, the angle
of reflection and the normal all lie in
the same plane.
4 Ray diagram to find
image position
●An object’s image seen in a mirror is
located by aligning two pins with the
image from two different positions.
The image is at the point where the
lines of the pairs of pins intersect.  
●The image of an object in a mirror is
upright, same size and virtual. Its
position is at an equal perpendicular
distance behind the mirror as the
object is in front of it.
●When an object is viewed in a mirror
its image is laterally inverted.

Key words
1 Action of the periscope
●When a mirror is set at an angle of 45°
to the horizontal (or vertical) the
angle of incidence of a ray of light
parallel to the horizontal is 45° and the
angle of reflection is also 45°. The
result is that the direction of the ray of
light changes by 90° or a right angle. 
●In a periscope two mirrors arranged at
45° are aligned in such a way that the
observer can see above or around an
object. The first mirror alters the
direction of light by a right angle and
the second mirror restores the light to
its original direction.
2 Kaleidoscope
●In a kaleidoscope two plane mirrors
are set at an angle of 60° with an
object between them. The object is
often a small number of coloured glass
or plastic shapes. 
●The mirrors provide a series of
multiple images which form a
symmetrical pattern at the end of the
kaleidoscope.
3 Action of a concave
mirror
●A concave mirror is also called a
converging mirror. It reflects parallel
rays of light to a single point or focus.
The focus of a concave mirror lies in
front of the mirror and is real.
4 Action of a convex
mirror
●A convex mirror is also called a
diverging mirror. It reflects parallel
rays of light away from the mirror in
such a way that they appear to be
coming from a single point or focus.
The focus of a convex mirror lies
behind the mirror and is therefore
virtual.

Key words
1 Definitions associated
with a concave mirror
●A spherical concave mirror can be
regarded as part of a sphere whose
center is called the center of
curvature. The distance from there to
the mirror is the radius of curvature.  
●A ray of light striking the mirror is
reflected through the focus (half way
between the mirror and the center of
curvature). The laws of reflection are
satisfied. The angle of incidence and
the angle of reflection are found by
drawing the tangent to the mirror at
the point where light rays strike it and
then the normal to this tangent.
2 Definitions associated
with a convex mirror
●A spherical convex mirror is also
regarded as part of a sphere. The
focus and center of curvature are
behind the mirror. The focus is half
way between the mirror and the
center of curvature, thus the radius of
curvature is twice the focal length.
3 Caustic curve formation
in a spherical mirror
●Light rays parallel to the principal axis
incident on a spherical mirror are
focused not through a single point but
through a series of points lying on the
radius of curvature. This effect is
spherical aberration. It results from
the mirror’s focal length for marginal
rays being less than for paraxial rays.
4 Elimination of caustic
curve using parabolic
reflector
●In a parabolic reflector all rays parallel
to the principal axis are reflected
through a single focus.
●Searchlight and car headlights use
parabolic reflectors. All the light is
reflected as a parallel beam.

The three rays used to find
the images formed by
reflection at a curved
mirror
●In order to locate the image of an
object formed by a convex or concave
mirror three rays may be drawn from
the top of the object. Any two of these
rays is sufficient to fix the location.
●For a convex mirror the rays must be
drawn as if they are coming from the
focus or the center of curvature.
●The intersecting rays locate the top of
the image. The image is then drawn
from the point of intersection to the
principal axis.
●Once the image has been located it is
possible to comment on its position
relative to the center of curvature and
the focus, and describe it as:
upright or inverted
magnified, diminished or same size
real or virtual.
1 Ray parallel to principal

●A ray parallel to the principal axis
which is reflected back through the
focus or appears to diverge from it.
2 A ray arriving through
the focus
●A ray through the focus which is
reflected parallel to the principal axis.
3 A ray returning along the
same path
●A ray passing through the center of
curvature which strikes the mirror at a
right angle to the path of the ray and is
reflected back along the same path.

1 Images formed by a
concave mirror
●The nature of the image formed by a
concave mirror depends on the
position of the object.
●When the object is between the focus
and the mirror the image is upright,
magnified and virtual since it is
behind the mirror. 
●When the object is at the focus it is
not possible to locate the image since
the rays normally used to locate an
image are parallel. The image is said to
be at infinity.
●When the object is between the center
of curvature and the focus a real,
inverted and magnified image is
formed.
●When the object is at the center of
curvature a real, inverted image the
same size as the object is formed at
the same point.
●When the object is beyond the center
of curvature an inverted, diminished
real image is formed between the
focus and the center of curvature.
●An object at infinity forms an inverted
real image at the focus.

●A convex mirror always forms a
diminished, upright, virtual image no
matter what the position of the object.
3 Convex mirror giving a

●A convex mirror gives a much wider
field of view than a plane mirror of
similar size.
●Convex mirrors are used as rear view
mirrors in cars and security mirrors in

Key words
Refraction
●The speed of light is constant for any
medium. The change of speed on
passing from one medium to another
causes refraction as light rays bend. 
1 Refraction and reflection
●When a light ray passes into a medium
with a different optical density, part of
the ray is reflected and part refracted.  
●When a light ray passes from a less to
a more dense medium, the angle of
incidence is greater than the angle of
refraction. When it passes the other
way, the converse is true.
●The ratio sine of angle of incidence :
sine of angle of refraction is the
refractive index for light passing from
one medium into another. For media 1
and 2, refractive index is 12. If 1 is a
vacuum (or air) the ratio is the
absolute refractive index, 2.
2 Real and apparent depth
●When a submerged object is viewed
from above the surface of water it
appears closer to the surface than it is.
This is due to light rays from the
object being bent away from the
normal as they pass out of the water
(the more dense medium) into air
(the less dense medium).
●The ratio of the real depth of the
object to its apparent depth equals the
refractive index of water.
3 Apparent depth used to
measure refractive index
●Real depth of the mark is S3–S1.
(Difference in readings when the
microscope is focused on the surface
of the liquid and on the mark in the
empty beaker.)
●Apparent depth of the mark is S3–S2.
(Difference in readings when the
microscope is focused on the surface
of the liquid and on the mark in the
beaker full of water.)

●When a ray of light passes from a more
to a less optically dense medium (from
water to air) at some angle of
incidence, the angle of refraction is
90° and the ray is refracted along the
interface between the two media. This
is called the critical angle, c. When
the angle of incidence is greater than
the critical angle no light is refracted
and total internal reflection takes
place.
2 Measuring critical angle
●The refractive index equals the
reciprocal of the sine of the critical
angle i.e.  = 1/sine c.
3 Deviation through prism
●A light ray passing from air into a glass
prism at other than a right angle is
refracted towards the normal. On
passing from prism back into air it is
refracted away from the normal. The
angle of deviation gives the overall
change in direction of the light ray.
4 Total internal reflection
●No refraction takes place when a light
ray passes from air into a glass prism at
a right angle to the surface.
●Total internal reflection occurs if the
light ray strikes another surface inside
the prism at greater than the critical
angle. Ray shown is turned 90°.
5 Prism turning ray 180°
● A 45° prism can also reflect light
through 180°. Thus a prism can reflect
light in the same manner as a mirror. 
6 Image formation with
prism
● An image viewed using a prism is
virtual, inverted and the same size as
the object.

Key words
1 Optical fiber
●Each time a light ray strikes the inside
of the fiber, total internal reflection
takes place. The ray passes from side
to side down an optical fiber with very
little loss due to absorption in the
glass, and emerges almost normally.
2 Light pipe
●Several optical fibers are taped
together to form a light pipe. The
many uses of light pipes include
medicine, engineering, and providing
illumination in difficult conditions.
●To reduce leakage of light at points of
contact between fibers, each fiber is
coated with cladding to promote total
internal reflection. The cladding is a
layer of glass of lower refractive index
than the glass from which the fiber is
made.
● Light pipes transport beams of light.
Changes in the orientation of the
fibers along the length of the pipe
present no problems.
3 Medical use
●If an image is to be used it is essential
that each fiber retains the same
position relative to the others in the
bundle throughout its length. 
●Such arrangements are more difficult
to manufacture than light pipes, but
are essential components of
instruments such as the endoscope
which a surgeon uses to view internal
parts of a patient’s body.
4 Transmission of signals
●Optical fibers are increasingly used to
carry television, telephone and
computer signals. Such signals are
generated as pulses of light from
lasers. Optical fibers are preferred to
traditional copper wires because of
their high information-carrying
capacity, freedom from noise caused
by electrical interference, lower mass
and signal loss, and greater security.

The human eye
accommodation
cornea
focal length
focus
lens
retina
Key words
1 The eye
●Light is focused on the retina, a layer
of light sensitive cells, by the cornea
and the lens. When the retina detects
light, an impulse is sent along the
optic nerve to the brain. The point
where the optic nerve leaves the eye is
called the blind spot and is not itself
sensitive to light. Within the wall of the
eye the choroid layer contains heavy
pigmentation which prevents light
from being reflected.
2 Focusing
●The eye can focus on objects over a
range of distances. This is called
accommodation and occurs by
altering the focal length of the lens.
The lens is held by suspensory
ligaments attached to a ciliary body
which is a ring of muscle. 
●To view distant objects, the ciliary
muscle relaxes. This pulls on the
suspensory ligaments which, in turn,
pull on the lens. The lens is stretched
thinner at the center and its focal
length increases. 
●To view near objects, the ciliary muscle
contracts. This reduces the tension on
the suspensory ligaments allowing the
lens to thicken at the center,
decreasing its focal length. 
3 Control of light entering
eye
●The amount of light entering the eye
through the pupil is controlled by the
iris which is composed of both circular
and radial muscles.
●In bright light the circular muscles
contract and the radial muscles relax.
This reduces the size of the pupil,
limiting the amount of light that can
enter the eye.
●In dim light the circular muscles relax
and the radial muscles contract,
increasing the size of the pupil,
allowing as much light as possible into
the eye.

cornea
focus
lens
retina
Key words
1 Short sight correction
●A short sighted person can see close
objects, but light rays from distant
objects converge in front of the retina.
Correction is made using a concave
lens which makes light rays diverge
slightly before being focused by the
cornea and lens onto the retina.
2 Long sight correction
●A long sighted person can see distant
objects, but light rays from close
objects converge behind the retina. It
is corrected using a convex lens. This
makes light rays converge slightly
before being focused by the cornea
and lens onto the retina.
3 Rods and cones
●The retina consists of rod and cone
cells. 
● Rods allow the eye to see in low light
and are responsible for night vision.
They do not register objects as clearly
as cones and do not respond to
different colors.
● Cones work best in good illumination
and are responsible for daylight vision.
They register a clear image and
respond to different colors.
4 Color vision
●There are three types of cones, each
sensitive to one of the three primary
colors. It is thought that a color is
perceived by one, two or three cone
types being stimulated to some extent. 
●Some people have red and green
absorption curves so close together
that they cannot distinguish between
these two colors and are red-green
color blind.
●Another type of color blindness results
from the complete absence of one
type of cone. A person with this defect
can only see colors formed by mixing
the two primary colors corresponding
to the cone types present.

Key words
1 Two types of image
●A real image is formed when rays of
light actually pass through it.  
●An image is described as virtual if rays
of light of light seem to come from it
but do not actually do so.
●A convex lens is a converging lens and
has real foci. A concave lens is a
diverging lens and has virtual foci.  
2 Three prisms forming an
image
●A lens can be thought of as a series of
prisms. A ray of light is refracted by
each prism through a common focus.  
3 Continuously curved
surface forming an image
●Lenses have a continuous curved
surface. A light ray striking the lens at
any point on one surface is refracted
through a common focus.
4 Lens shapes
●Lenses have a variety of types and are
named according to their shape. For
example, a plano-convex lens has one
flat and one convex side. Similarly a bi-
concave or double-concave lens has
two concave sides.
●A meniscus lens has one concave and
one convex side.
●The power of a lens is related to its
focal length. The shorter the focal
length the more the lens converges or
diverges light. The power, F, of a lens
is the reciprocal of its focal length, f,
measured in meters; F = 1/f.
●The unit of power is the radian per
meter, rad m-1. The focal length equals
distance, in meters, divided by angle of
deviation, measured in radians. This
has replaced the diopter, which was 
1 radian per meter.
● The sign convention for power is the
same as that used for focal length i.e.
positive for converging lenses and
negative for diverging lenses.

Key words
1 Focal points of lenses
●All lenses have two foci since light
passes through them in either
direction. For symmetrical bi-convex
and bi-concave lenses the foci are
equal distances on either side of the
lens and the focal length each side of
the lens is also equal.
2 Ray diagrams locating
image formed by lenses
●The position of the image of a small
object perpendicular to the axis of a
lens can be located by drawing two of
three possible rays from the top of the
object. The point of intersection of the
rays indicates the top of the image.
●A ray parallel to the principal axis
which, after being refracted by the
lens, passes through the principal
focus (convex lens) or appears to
diverge from it (concave lens).
●A ray which passes through the
(optical) center of the lens. This ray is
drawn straight with no deviation.
●For convex lens—ray which, after
passing through the principal focus, is
refracted by the lens and leaves it
parallel to the principal axis.
●For concave lens—ray which appears
to pass through the principal focus but
is refracted by the lens and leaves it
parallel to the principal axis.
●No matter at what distance an object is
placed from a concave lens, a virtual,
upright and diminished image is
always formed. Concave lenses are
used in spectacles to correct short
sight.
● The magnification, m, of a lens is the
ratio of the height of the image to the
height of the object. Magnification has
no unit or sign. If a magnified image is
formed magnification is greater than 1,
and if a diminished image is formed
magnification is less than 1.

Key words
Images formed by convex
lenses
●The image formed by a convex lens
depends on its distance from the lens.
● The position of an image formed by a
object can be found by calculation
using the formula:
1/u + 1/v = 1/f
u—distance between the object and
the center of the lens, v—distance
from the image to the center of the
lens, f—focal length of the lens.
● The focal length of a convex lens is
taken as positive, that of a diverging
lens as negative. A positive value for u
or v indicates that it is real, a negative
value indicates it is virtual.
1 Position and nature of
image formed by convex
lens
●When an object is at a distance of
more than twice the focal length of the
lens a real, inverted and diminished
image is formed.
●When an object is at a distance of
exactly twice the focal length of the
lens a real, inverted image which is
exactly the same size as the object is
formed at the same distance on the
opposite side of the lens.  
●When an object is at a distance
between one and two focal lengths
from the lens a real, magnified
inverted image is formed.
●When an object is at a distance exactly
equal to the focal length of the lens
the rays drawn to locate the image are
parallel. An image is said to form at
infinity.
●When an object is at a distance of less
than the focal length a virtual, upright
and magnified image is formed.

Key words
1 Producing a pure
spectrum
●Visible light is a small part of the
electromagnetic spectrum. Each color
corresponds to light of a different
wavelength.
●White light is a mixture of light of all
colors. When white light passes
through a prism different wavelengths
are diffracted by different amounts.
This effect is called dispersion and the
resulting visible spectrum of colors can
be shown on a screen.  
●In the visible spectrum there is a
gradual color change from one color
to the next. The spectrum, however, is
shown as consisting of seven colors;
red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo
and violet.
●The colors of the visible spectrum
correspond to the colors of the
rainbow. A rainbow is formed when
sunlight (which is white light) is
refracted by droplets of water in the
atmosphere and dispersion takes
place.
●The red light has the longest
wavelength and is refracted the least
while the violet light has the shortest
wavelength and is refracted the most.
2 Recombining white light
●If a pair of prisms, one upright and
one inverted, are placed next to each
other the first prism disperses white
light into its component colors while
the second recombines the colors
forming white light.
3 Newton’s disc
●Newton’s disc consists of a series of
seven segments corresponding to the
colors of the visible spectrum. When
the disc is rotated rapidly about its
center, the colors appear to merge
forming white light.

Color mixing

secondary colors
Key words
1 Primary colors
●Red, blue and green are the three
primary colors of light. All other
colors are made by combinations of
primary colors.
●The secondary colors, yellow, magenta
and cyan, are formed by mixing two
primary colors. 
2 Mixing of light
●Mixing of light occurs by addition.
●White light forms when light of the
three primary colors is mixed.
●When a secondary color is mixed with
its complementary color white light is
formed.
3 Colored light—absorption
and reflection
●An object’s color is determined by the
light it absorbs and reflects.
●A green box appears green when
viewed in white light. It absorbs red
and blue light and reflects green light.
●The same box when viewed in red
light appears black since it absorbs the
red light and reflects no light.
4 Primary pigments
●Primary pigments are colors which
cannot be made by mixing other
colored pigments. These pigments are
used to make paints.
5 Mixing of pigments
●Mixing of pigments occurs by
subtraction.
●Paints are seldom pure colors but
mixtures of colors in which one color
may predominate.  
●Blue paint appears blue because it
absorbs all the colors in white light
except green, blue and indigo. Yellow
paint absorbs all the colors except
orange, yellow and green. When the
two paints are mixed, all the colors of
white light are absorbed except green,
which is reflected. Mixing blue paint
and yellow paint makes green paint.

Key words
1 Magnifying glass
●A magnifying glass consists of a single
convex lens. When in use the object is
placed so that the distance to the lens
is less than the focal length of the lens
and the eye is placed close to the
other side of the lens.
●A magnifying glass produces an
upright, magnified virtual image.
Magnification, m, equals the height of
the image/ height of the object.
●The magnification is also equal to
v/u. v—distance from the image to the
center of the lens. u—distance from
the object to the center of the lens.
●m = v/u; using the lens equation  
1/u + 1/v = 1/f it follows that 
m = v/f – 1 
● A lens with a short focal length thus
has a large magnifying power.
2 Microscope
●A magnifying glass is also a simple
microscope, but it has limitations. The
focal length of a lens can be decreased
by making its surfaces more curved,
but this results in serious distortion of
the image.
●A compound microscope uses two
convex lenses of short focal lengths.
The objective lens forms a real,
magnified and inverted image of an
object placed just outside its principal
focus. The image is just inside the
principal focus of the second lens or
eyepiece, which acts as a magnifying
glass and produces a magnified virtual
image of the first image.
●Microscopes commonly have a choice
of objective lenses ranging from low
power x10 to high power x40. They
may also have a choice of eyepieces
such as x5 and x10. The total
magnification of a compound
microscope is the product of the
powers of the objective lens and the
eyepiece.

Refracting telescopes
●Refracting telescopes use lenses, but
large lenses are heavy, difficult to
support and have two ground
surfaces. Reflecting telescopes use
mirrors which can be made much
larger, are more easily supported and
have a single ground surface.
1 Simple telescope
●A simple telescope has two convex
lenses. The objective has a long focal
length while the eyepiece has a short
focal length. The lenses are arranged
so that their principal foci coincide.
●The objective lens forms a real,
diminished, inverted image of a distant
object at its principal focus. The
eyepiece acts as a magnifying glass
forming a magnified virtual image of
the first image. In normal adjustment,
this image is at infinity.
2 Terrestrial telescope
●A simple telescope produces an
inverted image. This is a problem for
viewing objects on Earth. 
●A terrestrial telescope has an erecting
lens between objective and eyepiece.
The image of the objective forms at
twice the focal length of the erecting
lens. A second real, upright image of
the same size forms at the same
distance on the opposite side of the
inverting lens. The eyepiece forms a
magnified third image at infinity.
3 Galilean telescope
●A Galilean telescope uses a convex
objective lens of large focal length and
a concave eyepiece of small focal
length to produce an erect image. 
● The image of the objective lens forms
at the principal focus on the opposite
side of the eyepiece. The converging
light rays falling on the eyepiece
behave like a virtual object and an
upright virtual image forms at infinity.

Key words
1 Spontaneous emission
●When atoms are excited, electrons are
promoted to high energy levels. They
normally return to lower energy levels
spontaneously. Radiation is emitted in
all directions and is incoherent.
2 Stimulated emission
●If a photon of exactly the correct
energy approaches an excited atom, an
electron may fall to a lower energy
level and emit another photon with
the same phase, frequency and
direction of travel as the first, which is
unaffected. This is called stimulated
emission and is the basis of a laser.
3 Optical pumping
●In a laser there must be more
electrons in upper energy levels than
lower (an inverted population).
●An inverted population can be
produced by illuminating laser material
with light (optical pumping).
●In a two energy level system, when the
electron population in the higher level
increases, the pumping radiation
induces stimulated emission so no
build up of electrons occurs. 
●In a three energy level system, the
pumping radiation promotes electrons
from E1 to E3 which fall to E2 by
spontaneous emission. An inverted
population arises between E2 and E1.  
●Spontaneous emission of a photon
due to an electron transition between
E2 and E1 may trigger stimulated
emission of more photons, giving the
laser effect.
4 Ruby laser
●A ruby rod laser, a three-level laser,
consists of a synthetic crystal of
aluminum oxide containing small
amounts of chromium.
●Optical pumping radiation is provided
by intense flashes of yellow-green light
from a flash tube. Electrons emit red
light on falling to level 1.

Electric charge
1 Positive and negative
●When a negatively charged strip is
placed close to a neutral polystyrene
ball the ball becomes polarized.
Electrons on the ball are repelled by
the negatively charged strip, resulting
in the side of the ball facing the strip
becoming positively charged and the
side facing away from the strip
negatively charged. The ball is
therefore attracted to the strip.
●A similar effect is observed when a
positively charged strip is placed close
to the same ball. In this case, the side
of the ball facing the strip becomes
negatively charged and the side facing
away becomes positively charged. The
result is the same and the ball is
attracted to the strip.
●A negatively charged strip repels a
negatively charged ball but attracts a
positively charged ball. Like charge
repel while unlike charge attract.
2 Atomic model
●An atom consists of a nucleus
containing protons and neutrons,
surrounded by electrons. Electric
charge is the result of loss (to give a
positive charge) or gain (to give a
negative charge) of electrons. The
particles in the nucleus of an atom
remain unchanged.
●An atom can become an ion either by
the loss or gain of one or more
electrons.
3 Charging by friction
●Before charging by friction there is no
imbalance of electrons on either the
poly(ethene) rod or the duster. 
●When the rod is rubbed with the
duster electrons are transferred from
the duster to the rod. The result is
that the duster becomes positively
charged while the rod becomes
negatively charged. As a result the
poly(ethene) rod and duster will be
attracted to each other.

leaf carry the same charge they repel
each other and the gold leaf rises.
2 Charge-sharing
●A poly(ethene) strip becomes
negatively charged because electrons
are transferred to it when it is rubbed.
If a charged strip is placed in contact
with an uncharged strip no charge is
transferred because poly(ethene) is an
electrical insulator and electrons are
unable to flow through it.
●If a negatively charged strip is placed
on the metal cap of an electroscope
charge is transferred because metals
are electrical conductors and electrons
are able to flow through them. The
gold leaf is repelled by the metal plate
indicating they carry the same negative
charge.
3 Testing the sign of a
charge
●If a negatively charged poly(ethene)
strip is placed on the metal cap of a
negatively charged electroscope
electrons flow from the strip into the
metal part of the electroscope. The
gold leaf moves even further away
from the metal plate indicating that
the amount of negative charge on the
electroscope has increased.
●If a positively charged acetate strip is
placed on the metal cap of a negatively
charged electroscope electrons flow
from the metal part of the
electroscope to the strip. The gold leaf
falls nearer to the metal plate
indicating that the amount of negative
charge on the electroscope has
decreased.

Charging by induction
1 Charging by induction
●Electrons flow through electrical
conductors.
●When a negatively charged strip is
placed close to but not touching an
insulated metal ball, electrons are
repelled from the side next to the strip
and accumulate on the other side.
One side of the ball becomes
positively charged and the other
becomes negatively charged.
● When the metal ball is in contact with
a second metal ball electrons flow;
negative charge accumulates on the
second ball, leaving the first ball short
of electrons—positively charged. The
balls retain their opposite charge when
they are separated and the charged
strip removed.
● No charge was transferred from the
strip to the balls. The strip simply
induced electrons to move from one
ball to the other.
2 Charging an electroscope
by induction
●When an electroscope is uncharged
there is no repulsion between the gold
leaf and the metal plate.
●When a negatively charged strip is
placed close to but not touching the
metal cap, it repels electrons from the
cap leaving it positively charged.
Electrons flow to the metal plate and
gold leaf which become negatively
charged and repel each other.
●With the charged strip in place, the
metal cap retains induced positive
charge. Electrons flow to earth if the
cap is touched; both metal plate and
gold leaf lose negative charge and no
longer repel. Electroscope is overall
positively charged.
● When the charged strip is removed,
positive charge flows through the
electroscope; the metal plate and gold
leaf again repel as they are now
positively charged.

1 van de Graaff generator
●A negative charge is produced on the
poly(ethene) roller by friction between
the roller and the rubber belt,
inducing a positive charge on an
earthed metal comb which is sprayed
off the points onto the outside of the
belt and carried upwards towards
another metal comb. When the
positively charged belt reaches the
comb the negative charge induced on
it is sprayed off the points leaving the
dome positively charged.
2 Electric wind
●Charge accumulates at the most highly
curved parts of an object. 
● Charge accumulates at each of the
four points of the mill and is
discharged to the surrounding air by
point or corona discharge. The “wind”
streams away from each point causing
the mill to spin around.
3 Lightning conductor
●Lightning results from a build up of
negative charge in the atmosphere
which induces a positive charge on
structures below. Electrons flow to
earth, or discharge, from the
atmosphere in a flash of light. 
●A tall structure may be damaged by
lightning discharging through it. A
lightning conductor, a thick strip of
good conducting material such as
brass or copper, provides lightning
with a low-resistance path to earth.
4 Electrostatic precipitator
●An electrostatic precipitator prevents
ash particles in wastes gases from coal-
fired power stations from being
released into the atmosphere.
●The particles become positively
charged on passing through a
positively charged wire grid. They are
attracted to earthed metal plates
where they are deposited. Periodic
mechanical shaking removes the ash.

1 Electrostatic powder
coating
●The powder coating is fluidized in a
stream of compressed air. As the
stream passes out of the gun the
particles become positively charged.
The object to be coated is earthed and
therefore negatively charged relative
to the powder particles. The powder
particles are attracted to the object
and will adhere to it.
2 Ink jet printer
●The jet of ink becomes positively
charged as it passes through the
charging cylinder. The potential
difference across the deflecting plates
is varied in such a way as to direct the
jet of ink onto the paper in a pattern
corresponding to what is to be
printed. 
●Since the jet of ink is positively
charged any droplets of ink that form
will also be positively charged and will
be repelled. These droplets collect in
the gutter and are recycled to the ink
reservoir.
3 Electrostatic finger
printing
●The positive terminal of the charger is
attached to the metal plate while the
negative terminal is attached to the
specimen.
●A dark background of fine particles is
sprinkled on the metal plate where
they become positively charged.
●The larger particles on the specimen
become negatively charged and are
attracted to the positively charged
metal plate. Since the plate is covered
in a dark background of fine particles
the pattern of the larger particles from
the specimen are easily seen.

1 The complete process for
a rotating drum copier
●Xerography—from the Greek words
for “dry” and “writing” is another word
for the photocopying process,
referring to the fact that the process
does not use liquid ink.
● When a document is placed on the
platen of a photocopier, the cover is
closed to exclude light and the button
is pressed to start the copying
procedure.
● The charging corotron, containing a
fine corona wire, is charged to several
thousand volts. The photoconductive
surface of the receptor plate (in the
form of a rotating drum) passes the
charging corotron and the surface of
the receptor plate gains a positive
charge of several hundred volts.
● At the same time, traces of bright light
are seen escaping around the edges of
the cover. This light captures an image
of the document; the image is
reflected by angled mirrors and
focused onto the surface of the
receptor plate.
● The light areas of the image cause the
receptor plate to lose electrons, while
positive charge remains in the dark
areas. An image of the document is
thus formed as a pattern of electric
charge on the receptor plate.
● The receptor plate rotates past the
developing unit. Toner particles are
mixed with beads which transfer them
to a roller. The roller brings toner into
contact with the receptor plate, where
it adheres to the charged areas of the
drum (representing the dark parts of
the document).
● A sheet of paper passing into the
machine is charged by a corotron. This
charge causes transfer of the toner
from the receptor plate.
● The surface of the paper is heated to
fuse the toner to the paper, and it
passes out of the machine.

1 Receptor plate
● The receptor plate is coated with a
photoconductor such as selenium (or
the less toxic poly(vinyl) carbazole) .
Electrons are released when light
shines on a photoconductor.
2 Charging receptor plate
● The receptor plate becomes positively
charged by rotating it in contact with a
corotron.
3 Exposure
● The document to be copied is
illuminated. Light reflected by the
document is focused and reflected by
a mirror onto the receptor plate.
● Light reflected from white areas of the
document falls on the receptor plate.
Areas of the coating receiving light
release electrons, neutralizing the
positive charge carried. Dark areas of
the document (text or illustration) do
not reflect light. No light from these
areas is received by the receptor plate
so those parts of the receptor plate
remain positively charged.
● An image of the document composed
of positive charge is formed.
4 Developing using toner
● Toner consists of very fine particles of
carbon black which are given negative
charge. When they come into contact
with the receptor plate they adhere to
the positively charged areas as the
receptor plate rotates.
● This results in a black image of the
original sheet of paper composed of
toner particles on the receptor plate.
5 Transfer onto paper
● The image formed on the receptor
plate is transferred to a sheet of paper.
6 Forming permanent copy
● The paper passes between rollers
which heat and compress it, fixing the
toner powder in place.

Problems created by
electrostatic charge
ELECTRICITY
1 Friction and static charge
●Static electricity is generated
whenever two materials touch and
then separate. Electrons are
transferred between the materials
leaving one positively charged the
other negatively charged.
●A build-up of static electricity occurs
when the rate of charge generation is
greater than the rate of charge
dissipation. The rapid build up of a
very high potential leads to
electrostatic discharge (ESD) sparks
and shocks.
2 Earthing static charge
●Static electricity may result from the
movement of fluidized solids, liquids
or gases through or over a material.
Precautions must be taken to prevent
ESD where the generation of sparks
could result in fires and/or explosions.
●In manufacturing processes involving
transferring fluidized solids, such as
flour, chocolate powder etc. pipes
must be earthed.
●The hoses used to transfer gas and
diesel into vehicles in petrol stations
are made of a special form of
conducting rubber.
●The charge which builds up on the
surface of aircraft during flight is
discharged to earth on landing.
3 Neutralizing static
charge
●During the manufacture of
poly(ethene) and other plastic film,
charge builds up on the film. If it is not
neutralized the film cannot be wound
onto a roller safely as each layer repels
the previous layer, since they carry the
same charge.
●The charge is neutralized using a
charge bar. This contains a strip of the
radioactive isotope polonium-210
which emits radiation in the form of
alpha particles, ionizing the air
around them. These ions neutralize
the charge of the poly(ethene).

Capacitance
1 Capacitance varies with
dielectric used
●A metal plate is shown to be charged
by connecting it to an electroscope.
The gold leaf rises indicating that it
and the metal plate carry similar
charge and thus repel each other.
●There is an electric field between
positively and negatively charged
plates which are placed next to, but
not touching, each other.
●Positively charged nuclei of dielectric
material molecules are attracted
towards the negatively charged plate,
electrons move the other way. 
●Dielectric molecules become distorted
with excess positive charge at one end
and excess negative charge at the
other, forming electric dipoles. 
●Within the dielectric, positive and
negative ends of adjacent dipoles
balance out, but the surfaces are
charged with opposite sign to the
plate they touch. Potential difference
between the plates is reduced.
● The force between oppositely charged
plates is always reduced when an
insulating material replaces a vacuum.
The material is said to have
permittivity. A material with a high
permittivity significantly reduces the
force between the plates compared to
a vacuum (or air).
● Capacitance increases if the plates are
separated by a dielectric with a high
permittivity.
2 Capacitance varies with
area of plates
●Capacitance increases as the area of
overlap between the positively and
negatively charged plates increases.
3 Capacitance varies with
separation of the plates
●Capacitance increases as the
separation distance between the
positively and negatively charged
plates decreases.

Practical capacitors
ELECTRICITY
1 Non-electrolytic
capacitors
●Capacitors have many uses in
electrical circuits. 
●Choice of capacitor depends on its
value, stability and the frequency of
any alternating current that will flow.
●Dielectric material breaks down at a
particular potential gradient. The
nature and thickness of the dielectric
determines the working potential
difference of a capacitor.
● Waxed paper capacitors are only used
where frequencies are less than 1
MHz. Their stability is also poor. Mica,
plastic and ceramic capacitors are
more stable and can be used at much
higher frequencies.
2 Electrolytic capacitors
●Electrolytic capacitors have much
higher capacitance.
●Their dielectric is a thin (as little as 
10-4 mm) film of aluminum oxide,
formed by passing a current through a
strip of paper soaked in aluminum
borate sandwiched between two strips
of aluminum foil. A layer of oxide
forms on one aluminum strip (the
anode). The remaining borate solution
is connected to the second aluminum
strip which becomes the cathode.
●A current of around 1 mA must pass
through the capacitor in the correct
direction to maintain the dielectric.
The anode is marked with a + and
must be connected at a higher
potential difference than the cathode.
3 Variable capacitors
●A variable capacitor, used to tune radio
receivers, consists of two sets of
interleaving plates. The capacitance is
determined by the degree of overlap.
●Air is the dielectric in such capacitors
and losses are low at all frequencies.
Breakdown occurs at relatively low
potential differences so the dielectric
should be relatively thick.

Color coding and size 
1 Non-electrolytic
capacitors
●The unit of capacitance, the farad, F,
is  a large unit so microfarads, F (10-6
F) or nanofarads, nF (10-9F), 
or picofarads, pF (10-12F) are used.
●The capacitance of non-electrolytic
capacitors is generally limited to a few
microfarads, and in the case of mica
capacitors, the limit is around 0.01 F.
Electrolytic capacitors can have values
up to 100,000 F.
2 Identifying capacitor size
●Large capacitors generally have their
value printed on them. For smaller
capacitors different conventions exist.
●There are a variety of different
marking conventions used to indicate
the size of a capacitor.
●Small disk type capacitors may carry
three numbers followed by a letter.
The first two numbers indicate the first
and second digits of the capacitance
and the third number is the multiplier
(as a power of 10). From these values
the capacitance is given in pF. The
letter indicates the tolerance.
3 Color coding
●Ceramic capacitors may be coded by a
series of colored bands. The first two
numbers indicate the first and second
digits of the capacitance and the third
number is the multiplier. The fourth
and fifth bands correspond to
tolerance and operating voltage.
4 Capacitors in a circuit
●When capacitors are connected in
series in a circuit their combined
capacitance, C, is given by:
1 = 1 + 1 + 1
C  C1 C2 C3
●When capacitors are connected in
parallel in a circuit their combined
capacitance, C, is given by:

Electric fields
ELECTRICITY
1 Attractive and repulsive
forces
●A body may be positively charged
(having a shortage of electrons) or
negatively charged (having an excess
of electrons).
●Bodies having the same charge repel
each other, those with opposite charge
attract each other.
2 Electric field patterns
●Charge on an isolated conducting
sphere is uniformly spread over its
surface due to the repulsion of like
charges, resulting in a radial field
pattern. The field outside the sphere is
the same as it would be if the charge
acted in the center of the sphere.
●Electric fields are represented by
electric field lines. The direction of
these lines is the direction in which a
positive charge would accelerate. Since
a positive charge would be repelled by
another positive charge, it would
accelerate away from it, thus electric
field lines point away from a positive
charge. Conversely, a positive charge
would be attracted towards a negative
charge thus electric field lines point
towards a negative charge. The
number of lines per unit cross-section
area is proportional to the field
strength.
3 Electric force field
●When two positive point charges are
brought close together electric field
lines are directed away from both
showing that a repulsive force exists
between them. There is a similar
pattern of field lines for two negative
point charges except that the field
lines are directed towards the charges.
●When a positive and a negative point
charge are brought close together,
electric field lines are directed away
from the positive charge towards the
negative charge, showing that a force
of attraction exists between them.

Electric fields and
Gauss’s theorem
1 Electric field line
●The direction of the field at any point
on an electric field line is the tangent
to the field line at that point.
2 Electric field of a dipole
●The direction of an electric field line is
given by the direction in which a
positive charge would accelerate along
it. Since like charges repel and unlike
charges attract, field lines are directed
away from a positive charge and
towards a negative charge.
●The resultant field is parallel to the
axis of the dipole.
3 Simple Gaussian surface
●A Gaussian surface can be any shape
that completely encloses a volume of
space and is often referred to as a
closed surface.
●When a sphere is charged the electric
field is spread symmetrically over its
surface.
●A small positive point charge Q placed
at any point in an electric field
experiences a force, F. Field strength,
E, at that point is: E = F
Q
●Calculate field strength, E (in a
vacuum) of point charge +Q at
position P (distance between P and Q
= r by considering small charge +Q0 at
P. Using Coulomb’s law, force F on Q0
is: F = QQ0

Electric current 1
ELECTRICITY
1 Showing an electric
current is a flow of electric
charge
●When the van de Graaff is running,
positive charge accumulates on the
dome. If a metal plate is connected to
the dome by a conducting wire,
positive charge will also accumulate on
the metal plate.
●The metallized ball becomes polarized
due to induction. The side facing the
positively charged plate will become
negatively charged and therefore
attracted to the plate.
●Once the ball touches the positive
plate it acquires a positive charge and
is then repelled by the positive plate
and attracted by the second metal
plate which is earthed to the base of
the van de Graaff generator.
●When the ball touches the second
plate it acquires electrons and
becomes neutral. The process of
being attracted to the positively
charged plate is then repeated.
●Electrons move around the circuit
carrying charge. The current produced
causes a deflection on the ammeter.
2 Metallized ball transfers
charge
●The direction in which a current
moves around a circuit is a cause of
some confusion. Prior to the
properties of electrons being known,
in the nineteenth century, scientists
decided to adopt a convention
whereby a current flowed from
positive to negative.
●Subsequent to this, it was discovered
that electrons carried a negative
charge and therefore actually flowed
from negative to positive in a circuit.
●As a result we talk about conventional
current as flowing from positive to
negative, and actual current flowing
from negative to positive.

Electric current 2
1 Ohmic conductor
●When the current flowing through a
conductor, such as a metal wire, is
directly proportional to the potential
difference allied across it the current is
said to be ohmic and obeys Ohm’s
law. Its resistance does not alter with
the potential difference applied across
it provided its temperature remains
constant.
2 Filament lamp
●A filament lamp is ohmic over a
narrow range of current. However, as
the current increases, the temperature
of the tungsten wire increases until it
becomes white hot, increasing the
resistance of the wire causing the
curve to become less steep.
3 Thermistor
●A thermistor is made of semi-
conductor material. As its temperature
increases its resistance decreases
causing the graph to bend upwards.
4 Thermionic valve
●A thermionic valve passes current in
one direction only. Current increases
with potential difference up to the
saturation current where the
resistance of the valve begins to
increase.
5 Gas
●The saturation current of a gas is
relatively small. A spark discharge
results in a rapid decrease in resistance.
6 Semiconductor diode
●Current passes when the potential
difference is applied in one direction
but is almost zero when the polarity is

ELECTRICITY
1 Electric current direction
●By convention, all current is assumed
to be due to the movement of positive
charges therefore when current
direction is marked on a circuit it is
from positive to negative.
●In metals an electric current is the
movement of negative charge in the
form of electrons. Electrons move
from negative to positive i.e. in the
opposite direction to the conventional
current. To differentiate from the
conventional current, this is called the
real current.
2 Flow of electric charge
●In a circuit charge is provided by a
battery or other source. It flows along
a conductor when there is a potential
difference, V, between points.
●The unit of charge is the coulomb (C).
One coulomb is the quantity of
electrical charge carried past a given
point in a circuit when a current of 
1 ampere flows for 1 second.
3 Current in a conductor
●A conductor of length, L, and cross-
section area, A, has n “free” electrons
per unit volume. Each electron carries
a charge e.
Volume of conductor = AL
Number of free electrons = nAL
Total charge, Q, of free electrons =
nALe
●The charge, Q, travels length, L, in
time, t, with an average drift velocity of
v. The resulting steady current, I, is
given by:
I = Q = nALe 
t
t
but v = L and therefore t = L
t 
v
so the drift velocity is given by:
v = I
nAe
For a current of 1 ampere passing
through an SWG gauge copper wire
the drift velocity is 0.6 mm s-1.

1 Kirchhoff’s first law
●In a circuit, the current arriving equals
the current leaving.
●Since current is the transfer of charge,
charge is conserved and flows in a
circuit without being destroyed or
accumulating at any particular point.
●This can be verified by measuring the
current at different points in a circuit.
2 Kirchhoff’s second law
●Around any closed circuit or loop, the
algebraic sum of the e.m.f. equals the
algebraic sum of the products of the
current, I, and resistance, R. This can
be expressed as E = IR.
●This can be verified by measuring the
potential difference (P.D.)at different
points in a circuit.
● This law is another way of stating the
law of conservation of energy using
electrical quantities.
3 Conversion of electrical 
energy into power
●When a current flows electrical energy
is converted into other forms of
energy. The power of a device is the
rate at which this conversion occurs. 
●If the P.D. across a device is V, the
current through it is I. The electrical
energy, W, converted in time t is given
by W = ItV.
● Power, P, is the rate at which energy is
converted: P = ItV = IV
t
●Device converting electrical energy
into heat energy is called a passive
resistor. The rate of production of heat
is also  IV. Since R = V
I
this can expressed as: 
P = IV = V2 = I2R
R
● Heat energy losses increase as the
square of the current so if the current
is doubled the heat losses will be
quadrupled.

1 Wheatstone bridge circuit
●A Wheatstone bridge circuit allows
resistance to be measured far more
accurately than is possible using an
ammeter and voltmeter. It is based on
the principle that when the ratio of
P/Q is equal to that of R/S then no
current flows through the
galvanometer and therefore the
potential difference across the
galvanometer must be zero.
●Using Ohm’s law
(V = IR) I1P = I2R and I1Q = I2S.
I1P = I2R thus P = R
I1Q
I2S 
Q

2 Comparing e.m.f.s 
●When the reading on the
galvanometer is zero the ratio of the
e.m.f.s of the cells, E1/E2 must be equal
to the ratio of the resistance in the
circuit containing E1 (L1 + L2) and the
resistance of the circuit containing E2
(L1) i.e. (L1 + L2) / L1. This values of L1
and L2 are found by moving the
contact from the galvanometer, often
called the jockey, along the wire.
3 Comparing resistances
●A potential divider can be used to
compare two resistances. When the
reading on the galvanometer is zero
the ratio of the resistances either side
of the jockey on the potential divider,
L1/L2 is equal to the ratio of the two
resistors P/Q.
L1 = P
L2
Q
4 Comparing p.d.s
●When the galvanometer reads zero
there is no current flowing through it
therefore the potential difference
across it must equal zero. This will
occur when the potential difference
across L1 is equal to the potential
difference across the resistor Q.

Ohm’s law
1 Testing current, voltage,
and resistance in a circuit
●A resistor, R, is connected in series
with a battery, lamp and variable
resistor. An ammeter is connected in
series with the resistor and a voltmeter
is connected in parallel.
●When the value of the variable resistor
is changed this alters the potential
difference across resistor and
therefore its current. The current and
the potential difference are recorded
for several different values.
●The lamp provides a visual indication
of how the total resistance of the
circuit is changing. When the value of
the variable resistor is high the current
falls and the lamp becomes dimmer.
2 Relating current and
voltage
●The graph of current against voltage is
a straight line indicating the current in
the resistor is proportional to the
potential difference across it. This
assumes that the temperature of the
resistor has remained constant.
●This relationship is known as Ohm’s
law. Conductors which obey this law
are called ohmic conductors.
●The gradient of the graph, 
I/V = 0.0333.
3 Ohm’s law
●Potential difference or voltage, current
and resistance are connected by a
simple mathematical equation.
●The gradient of the graph is equal to
I/V. The resistance of a resistor is
given by V/I therefore the resistance of
R is given by the reciprocal of the
gradient of the graph.
R = 1 / 0.0333 = 30 .

Electric meters 1
ELECTRICITY
1 Moving coil meter
●Most direct current meters are the
moving coil type. This consists of a coil
of copper wire, wound around a soft
iron cylinder, which rotates inside a
strong magnetic field provided by a
permanent magnet.
●The magnetic field produced in the
narrow air gap between the coil and
the permanent magnet is radial. The
field lines in the gap appear to radiate
from the central axis of the cylinder
and are always parallel to the plane of
the coil as it rotates.
●The coil is pivoted on jewelled
bearings and its rotation is resisted by
hair springs above and below it. The
springs are also the means by which
current enters and leaves the coil.
●When a current passes through the
coil it generates a magnetic field. This
interacts with the magnetic field of the
permanent magnet causing the coil to
rotate.
2 Moving iron meter
●The deflection of an alternating
current meter cannot depend upon
the direction of the current since this
is continually changing.
●In a moving iron meter two soft iron
rods are mounted inside a solenoid
parallel to its axis. One rod is fixed
while the other is attached to a
pointer.
●When current passes either way
through the solenoid the soft iron
rods are magnetized in the same
direction and repel each other. The
rod which is not fixed moves away
until it is stopped by the restoring
couple of the hair springs. 
●This type of coil can be used for
measuring direct current or alternating
current. The scale is non-linear, being
closer for smaller currents.

Moving coil meter
●A moving coil meter has a resistance
of 1,000 , due mainly to the coil, and
gives a full scale deflection when a
current of 100  passes through it.
1 Moving coil meter as
ammeter
●A resistor of very low value (called a
shunt) is connected in parallel with
the meter to convert it to an ammeter
reading 0–1 A.
●The meter and the shunt are in
parallel therefore the potential
difference across the meter equals the
potential difference across the shunt.
Applying Ohm’s law (V = IR):
0.0001 A x 1000  = 0.9999 x
resistance of shunt  = 
0.0001 x 1000 = 0.1 
0.9999
2 Moving coil meter as
voltmeter
●A resistor of very high value (called a
multiplier) is connected in series with
the meter to convert it to a voltmeter
reading 0–1 V.
●Applying Ohm’s law (V = IR) the
potential difference across the
multiplier and meter in series = 
0.0001 x (1000  + resistance of
multiplier)
The meter must give a full scale
deflection when a potential difference
of 1 V is applied across it therefore: 
0.000 1 x (1000  + resistance of 
multiplier) = 1 
Resistance of multiplier = 9000 
●Voltmeters are graded according to
their resistance per volt at full scale
deflection. Here, applying 1 V would
give a full scale deflection
corresponding to a current of 100 A
therefore the resistance per volt 
(R = V/I) is 10000 . The higher the
resistance per volt the more accurate
the voltmeter as the smaller the
current it draws.

Resistors 1
ELECTRICITY
1 Resistors in series
●When resistors are connected in series
the potential difference across the
network is divided between the
resistors V = V1 + V2 + V3. The same
current, I, is in each resistor.
●From Ohm’s law V = IR therefore 
R = V/I. An expression can be written
for each resistor:
R1 = V1/I; R2 = V2/I; R3 = V3I.
●It follows that IR = IR1 + IR2 + IR3:
dividing throughout the equation by I
gives RT = R1 + R2 + R3 where RT is
the total effective resistance.
●When resistors are connected in series
the total effective resistance of the
network is equal to the sum of the
individual resistors.
2 Resistors in parallel
●When resistors are connected in
parallel the current in each resistor is
dependent on the size of the
resistance I = I1 + I2 + I3. The same
potential difference is across each
resistor.
●From Ohm’s law V = IR therefore 
I = V/R. An expression can be written
for each resistor:
I1 = V/R1; I2 = V/R2; I3 = V/R3.
●It follows that 
V/R = V/R1 + V/R2 + V/R3: dividing
throughout the equation by V gives:
1/RT = R1 + R2 + R3 where RT is the
total effective resistance.
●When resistors are connected in
parallel the reciprocal of the total
effective resistance of the network is
equal to the sum of the reciprocals of
the individual resistors.
3 Resistors in series and
parallel
●When resistors are arranged in a
mixture of series and parallel circuits
within a network the effective
resistance of each part of the network
is found separately before the total
effective resistance is calculated.

1 Carbon resistor
●Resistors come in a variety of types
which are used in different ways in
circuits.
●Carbon resistors are composed of
carbon black, clay and a resin binder.
The mixture is molded into rods by
heating. Carbon is the conducting
material in the mixture. The value of
the resistance is determined by the
proportion of carbon present. 
●The stability of carbon resistors is poor
and their tolerance is usually ±10% at
best. However, they are cheap to
produce and are good enough for
many applications.
●The value of a carbon resistor may be
given in numbers or as a sequence of
colored bands.
2 Carbon film resistor
●Carbon film resistors consist of a
ceramic rod upon which is deposited a
film of carbon. The value of the
resistor depends on the thickness of
this film, and can be increased by
cutting a spiral groove in the coating.
The carbon film is protected by a
coating of epoxy resin.
●This type of resistor is more stable
than a carbon resistor and its tolerance
is commonly ±2%.
3 Wire-wound resistor
●Wire-wound resistors are very stable
and have a very low tolerance. They
also have the advantage over carbon
resistors that they can be
manufactured to have a large power
rating.
●This type of resistor is based on the
fact that the resistance of a wire
increases with its length. For high
precision resistors manganin (an alloy
of copper, manganese and nickel) is
used while for general commercial
resistors nickel-chromium wire
provides resistors which are
sufficiently accurate.

e.m.f.
●The e.m.f. of a battery or generator is
the energy, in whatever form,

unit charge passes through it. Its unit
is the volt. The e.m.f. of a source is 1 V
when 1 joule of one form of energy is
changed into electrical energy when 1
coulomb passes through it.
● A galvanometer can measure the
e.m.f. produced when wires of
different metals are connected.
2 E.m.f. of simple cell
●A simple cell is formed by placing two
different metals either side of a piece
of blotting paper which has been
soaked in a solution of an electrolyte
such as sodium chloride.
3 Daniel cell
●Early cells, such as the Daniel cell,
were described as wet cells as they
consisted of rods of different metals
suspended in liquid electrolytes such
as dilute sulfuric acid. The e.m.f. of the
Daniel cell is 1.1 V.

●In dry cells the electrolyte is a paste. In
a carbon-zinc cell the electrolyte is a
paste of ammonium chloride. The
e.m.f. of this cell is 1.5 V.
5 Car battery
●Cells which are discarded after use are
described as primary cells while those
that can be recharged are secondary
cells or accumulators.
●A car battery, or lead accumulator,
consists of plates of lead and lead
oxide in sulfuric acid, separated by
layers of insulator. When the battery is
discharging a chemical reaction takes
place; this is reversed when the
battery is being recharged.

Key words
1 The explosimeter
●The resistance of a material varies with
its temperature. This can be expressed
by its temperature coefficient of
resistance which is the fractional
increase in resistance at 0˚C per unit
rise of temperature. 
●Metals have positive coefficients i.e.
their resistance increases with
temperature rise. The value of the
coefficient is of the order of 1/275
per˚C.
●An explosimeter is used to measure
the concentration of combustible
gases present in a sample, in a location
such as a mine. The greater the
concentration the greater the heat
produced when the sample is burnt.
●Initially the Wheatstone bridge is
balanced. The sample is then
introduced to the hot wire.
Combustible gases are ignited and
burn in the presence of the wire. The
more heat is produced, the hotter the
wire becomes and therefore the more
its resistance increases. This disturbs
the Wheatstone bridge which gives a
reading.
●Flashback arrestors are installed in the
device as a safety feature to prevent
the explosimeter igniting  a sample
external to it.
2 The corrosometer
●A corrosometer is used to measure the
metal loss due to corrosion. 
●When the measuring element comes
into contact with the metal its
resistance is altered. This causes an
imbalance in the Wheatstone bridge
circuit which is rectified by the variable
resistor. The amount of rectification is
an indication of the amount of metal
loss.

1 Electric strain gauge
●An electric strain gauge converts
mechanical strain into a change in
resistance in itself. This is possible
because the resistance of a wire
depends on its length and cross-
sectional area.
●One form of strain gauge consists of a
very fine wire (of a nickel-iron-
chromium alloy) bonded to a slip of
thin paper. It is attached to the
component to be tested using a strong
adhesive so that whatever strain is
experienced by the component will
also be experienced by the wire.
●As the component is stretched so is
the gauge wire. This increases its
length and decreases its cross-section,
both of which increase its resistance.
This change in resistance can be
detected by a Wheatstone bridge
suitably calibrated to indicate the
magnitude of the strain.
2 Strain gauge pressure
transducer
●Initially the strain gauge windings
above and below the flexible cross
member are under the same strain and
therefore Wheatstone bridge circuit is
balanced. 
●When a force is applied to the
diaphragm the force rod is pushed
down, causing the flexible cross
member down at its center. The
insulating pillars below the cross
member splay out from each other
resulting in an increase in the strain
experienced by the windings around
them.
●This causes the windings to stretch,
thereby becoming longer and thinner,
which increases their resistance. The
result is an imbalance in the
Wheatstone bridge circuit which is
detected and converted into a
measure of the strain.

Electric power
1 The watt and the kilowatt
●The power of an electrical device is
the rate at which it converts electrical
energy into other forms of energy. The
higher the power the more electrical
energy is consumed per unit time.
●The unit of power is the watt (W). One
watt is the transfer of 1 J of electrical
energy into other forms of energy
each second.
● Electrical energy is often measured in
kilowatt hours kWh. One kilowatt
hour is the amount of electrical energy
which is converted to other forms of
energy when an electrical device
which has a power rating of 1 kilowatt
is used for 1 hour.
1 kWh = 1 x 1,000 x 60 x 60 =
3,600,000 J = 3.6 MJ
2 Power rating of

●All electrical devices have a power
rating. Devices which are designed to
heat in some way, such as irons, kettles
and fan heaters have the highest
ratings.
3 Operating current and
calculation of fuse required

using the equation:
Power = Current x Potential difference
●The information given on an electrical

1 Filament lamp
●A filament lamp consists of a thin wire
filament enclosed in a glass bulb. Such
lamps operate at very high
temperatures in order to emit light
and therefore the filament is made of
tungsten which has a very high
melting point (3400 ˚C).
●The glass bulb is filled with an inert
gas such as nitrogen or argon. The gas
reduces the evaporation of tungsten
and prevents it being deposited on the
inside of the bulb where it would
cause blackening. The bulb cannot be
filled with air as at high temperatures
the tungsten would undergo a
chemical reaction with oxygen.
●In addition to producing light energy,
filament lamps also produce
ultraviolet radiation and infrared
radiation (heat). The efficiency of
filament lamps as producers of light is
very low, of the order of 10 percent.
2 Fluorescent lamp
●A fluorescent lamp consists of a glass
tube with an electrode at each end.
The tube contains mercury vapor and
the inside surface is coated with a
phosphor material.
●When a high voltage is applied across
the electrodes electrons migrate
between them, colliding with atoms of
mercury. Energy is transferred to the
mercury atoms causing electrons to be
promoted to higher energy levels.
When the electrons fall back to their
ground state, energy is released as
ultraviolet radiation.
●The phosphor coating on the inside of
the tube is a fluorescent material. It
absorbs the ultraviolet radiation from
the mercury vapor and emits visible
light.
●Fluorescent lamps do not emit
unwanted ultraviolet radiation and
produce relatively little heat, therefore
they are typically 4 to 6 times more
efficient than filament lamps.

●Electrolysis causes chemical change
when an electric current passes

through the electrolyte.
●Negative ions (anions) are attracted to
the anode (positive electrode) while
positive ions (cations) are attracted to
the cathode (negative electrode).
● A voltameter measures the size of an
electric charge by detecting changes
to anode and cathode.

●The following reactions occur.
At the anode: Cu ➞Cu2+ + 2e-
At the cathode: Cu2+ + 2e- ➞Cu
●Copper goes into solution at the
anode which becomes smaller.
Conversely, copper is deposited from
the solution on the cathode which
becomes larger.
●The anode’s loss in mass equals the
cathode’s gain in mass. The
concentration of Cu2+ + ions in
solution remains constant so its color
neither fades nor deepens.
●If a block of impure copper forms the
anode, pure copper is deposited at the
cathode. Solid impurities fall and
accumulate below the anode.
3 Electrolysis of water
●Pure water ionizes to a very small
extent as follows: H2O 
H+ + OH-.
Due to the low concentration of ions it
is a very poor conductor of electricity,
but this increases if a small amount of
an ionic substance such as dilute
sulfuric acid is added.
● The following reactions occur at the
electrodes.
anode 4OH- ➞O2 + 2H2O + 4e-
cathode 4H+ + 4e- ➞2H2
Twice as much hydrogen as oxygen is
produced.

Magnetic fields of
magnets
ELECTRICITY
Magnetic field
●The direction of a magnetic field at a
point is the direction of the force that
acts on a north magnetic pole there.
●The pattern of field lines indicates the
shape and direction of the field. The
number of field lines per unit cross
section area indicates field strength.
1 Single magnet
●In a bar magnet the magnetic field is
concentrated at the ends of the bar.
Field lines are directed away from the
N pole and towards the S pole.
2 Combined fields of
magnet and Earth
●The magnetic field around a bar
magnet alters when it is placed in an
applied field.
3 Two north poles (end on)
●Like magnetic poles, either N—N or
S—S, repel each other. This is shown
by the pattern of field lines when like
poles are placed close together.
4 North and south poles 
(end on)
●Unlike magnetic poles, N—S, attract
each other. The magnetic field lines
are directed out of the N pole and into
the S pole.
5 Magnets broadside on
●When two bar magnets are placed
broadside to each other repulsion
occurs at both poles if they are in the
same orientation, and attraction if they
are in the opposite orientation.
6 Effects on soft iron
●When a bar magnet is placed close to a
piece of soft iron it induces magnetism
in the soft iron. The part of the soft
iron closest to the N pole acts as if it
was the S pole of a magnet, while the
part closest to the S pole acts as if it
was an N pole.

Magnetic fields due to an
electric current 1
1 A current produces a
magnetic field
●When a current is passed through a
wire it creates a magnetic field around
the wire which is demonstrated by the
deflection of a plotting compass. While
the current is flowing the compass
needle deflects but as soon as the
current is switched off the compass
needle returns to pointing north.
2 Field patterns produced
by currents
●The magnetic field around a wire
carrying a current consists of a series
of concentric circles. The direction of
the field is determined by the
direction of the current. 
●Conventionally, if a wire is represented
is section, a current coming out of the
page is represented by a dot (●) while
a current passing into the paper is
represented by a cross (+). The dot
and cross represent the tip and tail of
an arrow respectively. 
3 Determining a field
pattern
●The shape and direction of the
magnetic field around a wire carrying a
current can be found by placing
plotting compasses at different
locations around the wire. The needle
of a plotting compass lines up with the
magnetic field line and indicates its
direction.
4 Right hand screw rule
●The direction of the magnetic field
around a wire carrying a current can
be predicted using the “right hand
screw rule.” If a right-handed screw
moves forward in the direction of the
conventional current then the
direction of rotation of the screw gives
the direction of the magnetic field
lines.

Magnetic fields due to an
electric current 2
ELECTRICITY
1 Field pattern produced
by wire loop
●When an electric current is passed
through a loop of wire each part of the
loop can be regarded as a single wire.
The current passes in the opposite
direct in each part of the loop
therefore the magnetic field lines will
have the opposite orientation.
2 Field pattern produced
by solenoid
●A solenoid is a long cylindrical coil
composed of many loops. The field
pattern for a solenoid can be thought
of as the summation of the field
pattern for each loop. It is similar to
that of a bar magnet. 
3 Right hand grip rule
●The polarity of a solenoid can be
predicted using the “right hand grip
rule.” If the right hand is placed over a
solenoid with fingers pointing in the
same direction as the conventional
current passing through each coil, the
direction of the N pole of the solenoid
is given by the thumb.
●If the direction of the current is
reversed its polarity is also reversed.
●Electromagnetism may be described
as temporary magnetism since it only
exists when a current passes through a
conductor. 
●In general, the field produced by a
permanent magnet can be reproduced
by passing a current through a suitably
shaped conductor. This supports the
idea that all magnetic effects are due
to electric currents which, in the case
of permanent magnets, are the result
of the movement of electrons within
the atoms.
●Static charge gives rise to electric
fields. Moving charge i.e. current, gives
rise to both electric and magnetic
fields.

Magnetic field of Earth 1
1 Earth’s magnetic field
●Earth is surrounded by a magnetic
field. It is as if Earth contains a huge
imaginary bar magnet but the source
of the magnetic field is much more
complicated than this. 
●It is thought that the field is the result
of the movement of molten iron in the
outer core of the Earth some 3,000 km
or more below the surface.
2 Earth’s magnetic field in
terms of electric currents
●Magnetic North is the place to which
compass needles point. However since
the end of a compass needle marked
N points north it follows that Earth’s
magnetic north pole is actually a south
magnetic pole.
●Earth’s magnetic N pole is not fixed
either in terms of polarity or of
location. 
●Evidence obtained from rocks
containing minerals of iron indicate
that the polarity of Earth’s magnetic
field has reversed many times in its
history. These iron minerals aligned
with Earth’s magnetic field while the
rock was still molten and forming.
Their orientation provides a record of
Earth’s field when the rock was
formed.
●It has been suggested that a reversal of
polarity occurs when the circulation of
molten iron in Earth's outer core is
disrupted and then reestablishes itself
in the opposite direction.
3 Migration of north
magnetic pole
●The position of the north magnetic
pole can move erratically from day to
day but more usually it migrates
typically 10 – 40 kilometers each year. 
●The north magnetic field drifted
steadily north and west over the last
century and appears to be heading
towards Siberia in this one.

1 Resolving Earth’s
magnetic field strength
●Earth’s magnetic field strength, BR can
be resolved into horizontal, BH, and
vertical, BV, components: BH = BR cos
 and BV = BR sin , where  is the
angle of dip, the angle between the
horizontal and the magnetic pole.
●A compass needle is only affected by
BH since is only moves in the
horizontal plane.
2 The dip circle
●A dip needle is essentially a
magnetized needle, such as is found in
a compass, but suspended vertically so
that it moves freely about its center.
●At the north magnetic pole the vertical
component of Earth’s magnetic field
strength is at its maximum and the
horizontal component is zero. A dip
needle points vertically downward at
this point on Earth.
●At the magnetic equator the vertical
component of Earth’s magnetic field
strength is zero and the horizontal
component is at its maximum.
Anywhere on the magnetic equator a
dip needle lies horizontal.
●The dip angle indicates the position of
a location in terms of latitude relative
to Earth’s magnetic poles. In the
southern hemisphere it is the opposite
end of the dip needle which indicates
the dip angle. 
3 Angle of declination
●The angle of declination is the angle
between the geographical North Pole
and the magnetic north pole. Since
the location of the magnetic north
pole is not constant, it is necessary for
people relying on a compass that
navigation to make periodic
amendments to their instruments and
charts. The increasing use of satellites
for navigation has made this less of a
problem in recent years.

Forces in magnetic 
fields 1
1 Current-carrying wire in
a magnetic field
●A circular magnetic field is generated
around a current-carrying wire. The
direction of the field reinforces the
applied magnetic field below it and
opposes that above it, resulting in the
wire being thrust upwards.
2 Current balance
●A horizontal wire loop, balanced at its
center, has one end within a magnetic
field produced by a coil. This part of
the loop moves down when current
passes through it. The size of the force
is measured by adding counter weights
to the opposite end of the loop. 
3 Fleming’s Left-Hand Rule
●This relates motion, magnetic field and
current in motors.
4 Motion of a charge
moving in a magnetic field
●The force exerted on a current-
carrying conductor in a magnetic field
is the resultant of the forces acting on
the charges.
●For a particle carrying a charge, q,
moving at velocity, v, in a conductor at
an angle 	 to a uniform magnetic field
of flux density, B, the force exerted on
the particle, F = Bqvsin	. 
●If the charged particle enters the
uniform magnetic field at a right angle
then 	 = 90º, sin 	 = 1 and F = Bqv. 
●The direction of the force is at right
angles to the field and the direction of
motion, resulting in the particle being
deflected in a circular path.

in uniform field

uniform magnetic field other than at a
right angle then sin

is deflected in a helical path.

Forces in magnetic 
fields 2
ELECTRICITY
1 Force between current
carrying wires
●When current passes in the same
direction through parallel wires, the
circular magnetic field around both
wires has the same direction—either
clockwise or counterclockwise.
Overlapping parts of the fields
between the wires are opposite in
direction so the wires are forced
together.
●When current passes in opposite
directions through parallel wires the
direction of the circular magnetic field
around the wires is different.
Overlapping parts of the fields
between the wires are in the same
direction so the wires are forced apart.
2 The Hall effect
●When a current carrying conductor is
placed in a magnetic field it has a small
potential difference across its sides at
right angles to the field.
●This effect is caused by forces acting
on the charge carriers in the
conductor. These forces act at right
angles to the magnetic field and the
current and cause the charge carriers
to be pushed sideways. Their
concentration increases on one side of
the conductor thus leading to a
potential difference across it.
3 Measuring Hall voltage
●A current of around 50 mA is passed
through the Hall slice (such as a piece
of doped germanium). If the
connections to the Hall slice are not
exactly opposite each other there will
be a potential difference between
them irrespective of whether a
magnetic field is applied to the slice.
In this case the balance control is used
to zero the meter.
●If a Magnadur magnet is placed face
down on the Hall slice the voltmeter
indicates that a potential difference
now exists across it.

Electromagnets 1
Electromagnetism
●Electromagnetism is called temporary
magnetism since it only exists while a
current is passing. An electromagnet
can be switched on and off unlike a
permanent magnet.
1 Experimental
electromagnet
●When a current passes through a wire
a magnetic field is generated around it
however, to make a practical
electromagnet, the wire is wound into
a coil.
●An electromagnet’s strength can be
found by measuring the weight of iron
which it can support. A simple
comparison of the strengths of
electromagnets can be made using
small articles e.g. nails or paper clips.
●The strength of an electromagnet
increases when the number of turns of
wire in the coil increases.
●The strength of an electromagnet
increases when the current passing
through the coils increases.
●The strength of an electromagnet
increases when the coil is wound
around a core of soft iron.
2 Horseshoe
electromagnet
●A horseshoe electromagnet can be
made by winding a coil around each
limb of a soft iron core.
●If the coils are wound around the
limbs in the same direction the
magnetic fields cancel each other out
and the core is not magnetized.
●If the coils are wound around the
limbs in opposite directions the limbs
are magnetized with opposite polarity.
3 Practical electromagnet
●Electromagnets are used in scrap yards
as a convenient way of moving ferrous
metals (iron and steel) and separating
them from non-ferrous metals such as
aluminum, copper and brass.

1 Electric door bell
●When the switch is closed the circuit is
complete and current flows through
the coil. The soft iron core becomes
magnetic and attracts the armature. As
the armature moves it strikes the gong
while at the same time breaking the
circuit. The soft iron core ceases to be
magnetic and the steel spring returns
the armature to its original position,
completing the circuit once again. The
cycle is repeated for as long as the
switch remains closed causing the bell
to ring.
2 Door bell with chimes
●When the switch is closed the coil of
insulated copper wire becomes an
electromagnet and the soft iron collar
is pulled down into it causing the
poly(ethene) bobbin to strike the
lower metal plate. The spring is
compressed and forces the
poly(ethene) bobbin and soft iron
collar back up again to strike the
upper metal plate. The bobbin will
continue to oscillate up and down in
this way while the switch is closed.
3 Telephone ear piece
●A variable current passes through the
coil in the ear piece. This produces
changes in the strength of the
magnetic field below the diaphragm
which causes it to move up and down
making sound waves.
4 Magnetic relay
●When the switch is closed current
flows through the coil and the soft
iron core becomes magnetic. As one
end of the armature is attracted
downward towards the core the other
end moves upwards closing the
contacts.

Electromagnetic
induction 1
1 Moving a conductor in
a magnetic field
●When a conductor is moved in a
magnetic field in such a way that it
cuts the magnetic field lines a current
is induced in it. This occurs when the
conductor is moved horizontally or
vertically through a magnetic field but
not when it is moved from one
magnetic pole to the other along the
field lines.
●Moving one end of a loop either into
or out of a magnetic field causes a
deflection on the galvanometer while
the loop is moving. 
2 Right-hand rule
●Fleming’s Right-hand rule, used for
electric generators, relates motion,
magnetic field, and current.
3 Moving a magnetic field
around a conductor
●A current is also induced if the
conductor remains stationary and the
magnetic field is moved. What is
important is that the conductor is
moving relative to the magnetic field
and that it cuts the magnetic field
lines.
4 Moving both magnetic
field and conductor
●There is no induced current when the
conductor and magnetic field move
together in the same direction or
when the conductor remains
stationary inside the magnetic field.
This is because magnetic field lines are
not cut by the conductor.
5 Conductor moving within
magnetic field 
●When a closed loop is moved entirely
within a magnetic field, a current is
induced, moving in the same direction
at both ends of the loop. The result is
that they cancel each other out giving
zero current.

ELECTRICITY
Faraday’s law of
electromagnetic induction
●Faraday suggested an explanation of
electromagnetic induction based on
magnetic field lines. He proposed that
an e.m.f. is induced in a conductor
either when it cuts field lines or when
there is a change in the number of
lines linking it i.e. passing through it.
These often amount to the same thing. 
●The number of field lines per unit
cross-sectional area represents the
magnitude, B, of the flux density.
Where the flux density acts at right
angles to and over an area, A, the
magnetic flux, F = BA.
●If F is the flux through the cross-
sectional area A of a coil of N turns the
total flux through it, or flux linkage, is
NF since the same flux, F, links each of
the N turns.
●Faraday’s law of induction states that
the induced e.m.f. is directly
proportional to the rate of change of
flux linkage or rate of flux cutting.
1 Flux changes and e.m.f.
●When part of the loop passes between
the magnetic poles there is a change
in the flux. A deflection on the
galvanometer indicates that an e.m.f
has been induced.
●When the whole of the loop passes
through the flux there is no net
change in the flux and no e.m.f. is
induced.
2 Rotating conductor in a
magnetic field
●When a coil of wire is rotated in a
magnetic field each turn of wire cuts
through the flux inducing an e.m.f.
The result is a potential difference
across the coil thus a current flows
through it. This is the basis of an
electric generator.

Generating electric
power
1 AC generator
●A simple alternating current
generator consists of a coil rotating
inside a magnetic field produced by a
permanent magnet. Current is taken
off via slip rings. 
●Brushes pressing against the slip rings
transfer current to the load. Brushes
are made of a soft conducting material,
such as graphite.
2 DC generator
●A simple direct current generator is
identical to an AC generator except
that slip rings are replaced by a
commutator. 
3 E.m.f. against time for
AC generator
●As the coil rotates the rate at which it
cuts the magnetic field lines changes.
When it moves through the vertical it
passes along the field lines but does
not cut them therefore no e.m.f. is
produced. When it moves through the
horizontal it passes through maximum
flux density therefore maximum e.m.f.
is induced.
● If Flemings Right-hand rule is used to
predict the direction of the induced
current in a single turn of a coil it is
found that the direction of the current
reverses each half turn.
4 E.m.f. against time for
DC generator
●As the coil rotates the induced e.m.f. is
zero when it moves through the
vertical and maximum when moving
through the horizontal.
●The commutator ensures that the
output current of a DC generator does
not reverse direction. As the induced
current in the coil is reversed the
output through the commutator is
also reversed.

The DC electric motor
ELECTRICITY
1 DC motor
●The structure of a simple DC motor is
identical to that of a DC generator.
The only difference in the devices is
the direction of the energy transfer.
●In a generator: kinetic energy ➞
electrical energy
In a motor: electrical energy ➞kinetic
energy
●A direct electric current (from a
source such as a cell) passing through
the coil creates a magnetic field
around it. If the coil is positioned
within a magnetic field, the field
around the coil interacts with the
applied field causing the coil to rotate.
2 Series wound motor
●In simple DC motors a permanent
magnet often provides the field within
which the coil rotates. In practical DC
motors both the field and the coil are
electromagnets.
3 Forces acting on the coil
●The direction of the force acting on
each side of a coil can be predicted by
applying Fleming’s left-hand rule or
the motor rule to each side.
●Opposite sides of the coil which are
perpendicular to the applied magnetic
field are acted on by vertical forces in
opposite directions. A pair of forces
acting in this way are called a couple.
●Opposite sides of the coil which are
parallel to the applied magnetic field
are acted on by forces directly
perpendicular to that field.
4 Forces on coil at
different parts of cycle
●Forces causing the coil to rotate are
greatest when the coil is moving
horizontally relative to the magnetic
field lines, and least when the coil is
moving through the vertical.

Transformer-induced
e.m.f.s 1
1 Inducing current two
ways
●The outer solenoid forms part of a
circuit whose current can be altered. A
magnetic field forms around it when
current flows.
●An e.m.f. is induced in the inner
solenoid if it is moved in or out of the
outer solenoid, cutting through
magnetic field lines. This induced
current changes direction as the inner
solenoid is pushed in or pulled out.
●If the current passing through the
outer solenoid is slowly reduced to
zero the magnetic field around it
slowly collapses. Magnetic field lines
cut the inner solenoid and an e.m.f. 
is induced.
2 Continuously changing
current
●An AC reverses direction during each
cycle. The polarity of the magnetic
field generated when an AC passes
through a conductor also reverses.
●The magnetic field generated around a
coil connected to an AC supply grows
and collapses twice each cycle owing
to changes in polarity. 
●When a coil is wrapped around a soft
iron yoke, the yoke becomes a
magnet. Field lines around the yoke
grow and collapse, cutting turns of
wire in a secondary coil, inducing an
AC in it.
●This is the principle upon which
transformers work. 
3 Effect on e.m.f. of
number of turns
●If the number of turns of wire in a coil
is increased the rate at which the flux
is cut also increases therefore a greater
e.m.f. is induced in the coil.
4 Effect on e.m.f. of
solenoid area
●The ratio of the e.m.f.s induced in the
coils equals the ratio of their areas.

ELECTRICITY
1 Effect on e.m.f. of rate of
flux change
●The rate of change of flux can be
increased or decreased by altering the
frequency of the signal. As the rate of
change of flux increases so does the
induced e.m.f.
2 Power loss in a
transformer
●A 6 V lamp provides the load on the
secondary coil of the transformer.
●Electrical power can be calculated
using the equation:
Power = Current x Voltage.
Input power at primary coil = 
A1 x V1
Output power at secondary coil = 
A2 x V2
Power loss in the transformer = 
A1 x V1 = A2 x V2
Small energy losses (in the form of
heat) do occur due to resistance in the
windings, and eddy currents and flux
leakage in the core.
3 Measuring mutual
inductance
●A change in current in one coil or
circuit can induce an e.m.f. in a
neighboring coil or circuit. The phase
difference between the coils or circuits
is one quarter of a cycle.
●The mutual inductance, M, is defined
by the equation:
M = 
-
dIp/dt
where  is the e.m.f. induced in the
secondary when the rate of change of
current in the primary coil is dIp/dt.
●The unit of mutual inductance is the
henry (H). Two coils have a mutual
inductance of 1 henry if an e.m.f. of 
1 volt is induced in the secondary coil
when the current in the primary coil
changes at a rate of 1 ampere per
second.
●The value of M is much higher when
the coils have a ferromagnetic core.

1 Forces on induced
currents
●When an alternating current is passed
through the coil it induces an eddy
current in the aluminum ring. The
direction of the eddy current is such
as to produce a magnetic field which
opposes the one in the coil thus the
aluminum ring is repelled up the iron
core.
2 Electro-magnetic
damping
●As the copper sheet swings it cuts the
magnetic field lines and an eddy
current is induced in it. The eddy
current always tends to oppose the
motion of the sheet so it rapidly
comes to rest.
●If sections of the copper sheet arc
removed then a much weaker eddy
current is induced and the damping
effect is much reduced.
3 3-phase electric motor
●In a 3-phase electric motor three pairs
of stationary electromagnets are
arranged at equal angles around a
rotor. Each pair is connected to one
phase of a three phase AC supply. The
phases reach their maximum values
one after another in a repeating cycle.
4 Shaded-pole electric
motor
●A shaded-pole induction motor
produces a rotating magnetic field by
covering part of the pole of an
electromagnet carrying alternating
current with a conducting plate such a
sheet of aluminum. The current
induces eddy currents in the plate
which create a second magnetic field
adjacent to the first. The metal disc
interprets the phase difference
between the two fields as a moving
field and responds by rotating.

1 3-phase electric power
production
●Each of the coils is connected to one
phase of a 3-phase AC supply. They
provide the stationary electromagnets
or stator in the electric motor. They
are arranged at 120° to each other
around a conductor or rotor. 
●Each phase of the 3-phase AC rises to
a maximum value in turn in a
continuous cycle. During one rotation
of the rotor each stator carries
maximum current for part of the time,
while the other windings carry smaller
currents.
2 Producing rotating
magnetic field 
●Each phase of a 3-phase AC is fed into
each coil in turn with the direction of
the current reversing half way through
the cycle. This produces a magnetic
field which moves around the rotor. 
●The rotor is often of a “squirrel cage”
design. This consists of a number of
copper rods contained in an iron
cylinder. The rotor interprets the
alterations of the magnetic field as a
magnetic field sweeping around it, in
other words a rotating field. The eddy
currents induced in the copper rods
cause it to rotate.

transmission 1
1 Transmission without
transformer
●The longer a wire the greater its
resistance and the greater the loss of
electrical energy from it as heat when
a current flows through it. 
●A drop in brightness of a lamp
indicates a fall in power due to loss of
electrical energy.
● Energy lost as heat from a wire, 
E = I2R (R—resistance of the wire; 
I—current). Loss of current results in a
significantly larger energy reduction if
electricity is transmitted long distances
at large current values.
● Losses are significantly lower if
electricity passes through wires with
increased voltage and decreased
current.
2 Transmission with
transformer
●A step-up transformer increases
voltage and decreases current.
●Vin/Vout = n1/n2 ( n1—number of turns
in primary coil, n2—number of turns
in secondary coil).
●Input power = Output power (assuming
100% efficiency) and 
Power = Potential difference x Current
●If n2 is twenty times n1, e.m.f. induced
in the secondary coil is twenty times
that in the primary coil.
●Current decreases by a factor of 20
and energy losses decrease by a factor
of 202 (400).
● In the step-down transformer n1 is
greater than n2 thus e.m.f. is reduced
and current increased.
3 Use of transformer
● step up: n1 = 120, n2 = 2400; voltage
increases 20 fold.
● step down: n1 = 2400, n2 = 120;
voltage decreases 20 fold.
● The similarity in brightness of the two
lamps shows that little power has been
lost through the wires.

1 The grid system
●In a power station electricity is
generated at a potential difference of
25,000 V. In order to reduce energy
losses the potential difference is
increased to 400,000 V using a step-up
transformer for transmission through
the super grid.
●Increasing the potential difference by a
factor of 400,000 / 25,000 = 16
reduces the current by a factor of 16.
Since the energy lost as heat from
cables is proportional to the square of
the current, this reduces the energy
losses by a factor of 162 = 256.
●A step-down transformer is used to
reduce the potential difference to
132,000 V for transmission through the
lower voltage grid.
●Electricity at a potential difference of
132,000 V is far too dangerous for
domestic use so it is necessary to
reduce the potential difference using
step-down transformers. 
●Heavy industry uses electricity at a
potential difference of several
thousand volts while electricity for
home use is supplied at 120 V.
2 Pylon
●It is cheaper to suspend power lines
from metal pylons that to bury them in
the ground. 
●The live cables are insulated from the
pylon by large glass or porcelain
insulators. A single neutral cable is run
over the top of the pylon.
3 3-phase current
●If AC was transmitted in single phase
the current would only reach its
maximum positive and negative value
once in each cycle. It is more
economic to use 3-phase transmission
where each phase is offset from its
neighbor by 120˚.

Transients: capacitor
1 Capacitor discharging
through 1 M resistor
●When S1 is closed current (Ic amps)
flows and the capacitor (C farads)
begins to charge. The current
decreases progressively slowly to zero.
Potential difference, Vc, initially rises
rapidly and then progressively more
slowly until reaching 6V. 
●The growth curves for Ic and Vc are
both exponential. A graph of charge,
Q, on the capacitor against time would
have the same shape as Vc since 
Q = VcC.
●S1 is opened, S2 closed, the capacitor
discharges. The graph of voltage
against time as the capacitor
discharges is also exponential. In
exponential decay curves a quantity
decreases by the same fraction in
equal time intervals. The time taken
for half the original quantity to decay
is the half life of the process.
●For capacitor value C, charged through
resistor value R, and charging current
constant at its starting value, the
capacitor is considered fully charged
after time T (the time constant). T = R
x C seconds. (Although i decreases
with time, T is a useful measure of a
capacitor’s charging and discharging
time.)
● When a 1 F capacitor discharges
through a resistor of 1 M; time
constant, T = R x C = 106 x 10-6 = 1s.
● Time taken for potential difference
across the capacitor to fall to half its
starting value (from 6 to 3 V)
= loge2 x T = 0.7 x 1 = 0.7 s.
2 Capacitor discharging
through 2 M resistor
●If a 2 M resistor is used; T = 2 s
●The time taken for the potential
difference of the capacitor to fall from
6 to 3V is 0.7 x 2 = 1.4 s.
● The larger the resistor, the longer the
capacitor’s discharge time.

Transients: inductor
ELECTRICITY
Inductor
●An inductor is a coil of wire which may
either have a core of air or of some
magnetic material. Inductors oppose
current changes and are said to have
inductance. Inductors use the symbol
L and the unit of inductance is the
henry (H).
●A flux is produced in the coil when
the current passes. If the current
changes the resulting flux change
induces an electromotive force in the
coil itself. This changing magnetic field
type of electromagnetic induction is
called self induction.
●The current in an inductor is greater if
the inductance is low i.e. the coil has
few turnings and does not surround a
magnetic core. It is also greater if the
frequency of the AC it carries is low,
therefore the current changes value
more slowly.
1 Investigating induction
●The induced electromagnetic force
opposes the current change which
causes it. When connected to a supply,
the current passing through an
inductor grows exponentially up to a
maximum. The time taken for the
current to rise from 0 to 0.5 A is the
same as for 0.5–0.75 A and so on.
●The time constant for a circuit
containing an inductor, L, and a
resistor, R, is given by L/R thus it
depends both on the inductance and
resistance.
2 Effect of changing the
time constant
●Increasing the size of the resistor, R,
increases the time constant and
decreases the maximum current that
passes through the circuit.
●The time constant for a circuit
containing a 1.0 henry inductor and a
2.0 ohm resistor is 2/1 = 2.0 s.

Radio
1 Transmission and
reception
●Audio frequencies (a.f.) are
alternating currents with frequencies
below 20 kHv. Radio frequencies (r.f.)
have frequencies above 20 kHz. In
radio a.f. is combined with r.f. in order
to send it over long distances.
●A transmitter is an oscillator that
produces an r.f. current. If connected
directly to an aerial it would send out
an electromagnetic wave called a
carrier wave Before transmission the
r.f. signal is modified or modulated to
carry the a.f.
●In a receiver the tuning circuit selects
the wanted signal from the aerial The
detector or demodulator separates
the a.f. from the r.f. carrier signal. 
2 AM and FM
●In amplitude modulation (AM) the
speech or music from, for example, a
microphone is used to vary the
amplitude of the carrier wave so that it
follows the wave shape of the a.f.
●In frequency modulation (FM) the
frequency of the carrier wave varies
with the information signal. It
increases if the information signal is
positive and decreases if it is negative.
3 Tuning circuit
●All radio waves of different frequencies
induce a signal in the aerial of a radio
receiver. If the aerial is connected to
an L-C circuit only the signal whose
frequency equals the natural frequency
of the L-C circuit is selected. This is an
example of electrical resonance. The
radio is tuned to different radio
stations by varying the value of C.

Television
ELECTRICITY
1 Electron beam tracks
screen
●A television is, in essence, a cathode
ray oscilloscope with two time bases
which cause a beam of electrons tracks
across the screen in a sequence of
horizontal lines. When electrons hit
the screen they cause the fluorescent
coating to glow. A picture is produced
when an incoming signal alters the
number of electrons which travel from
the electron gun to the screen. On the
screen of a black and white television
this causes the brightness of spots to
vary between white through different
shades of gray to black.
●A complete new picture appears on
the screen every 1/25th of a second.
Each new picture is slightly different
from the previous one but persistence
of vision gives the effect of a
continuous picture rather than a
sequence of stills.
2 Color image formation
●In a color television there are three
electron guns. The fluorescent screen
is coated with around a million tiny
light-emitting dots arranged in
triangles.
●In each triangle there is one dot that
emits red light when hit by electrons,
one which emits blue light and a third
that emits green light.
●A metal shadow mask ensures that the
electrons from one gun only hit red
light emitting dots, electrons from
another gun only hit blue dots, and
electrons from the third gun only hit
green dots. 
●All colors are made by combining dots
of these three colors in different
intensities. For example, in a triangle
of dots, if the electron beams to the
red and green dots are intense while
the electron beam to the blue dot is
not then the dot will emit red and
green lights strongly and appear
yellow.

2 Phase difference
●This shows two alternating currents

3 Voltage across capacitor
●Alternating current flows around a
circuit containing a capacitor because
the capacitor plates are continually
being charged and discharged and
then charged the opposite way around
by the alternating voltage. 
●If the amplitude of the current is
denoted by the amplitude of the

instantaneous voltage, V, at time, t, is
V = Vmsinft.
●If C is the capacitance of a capacitor
the charge on its plates is given by 
Q = CV therefore Q = CVmsinft.

I, flows through each component so
the reference vector will be that
representing the current. The p.d.
across the resistor is in phase with the
current while the that across the
capacitor lags by 90°.
●The resultant voltage, V= I(R2 + Xc2)
where Xc is the reactance of C.

across the resistor is in phase with the

R.C. network 1: AC
response
1 Crossover circuit
●More than one loudspeaker is needed
to handle the full range of frequencies.
In practice a large loudspeaker, called
a woofer, deals with low frequencies
while a smaller loudspeaker, called a
tweeter, deals with high frequencies.
Sometimes a third speaker may be
present to deal with middle
frequencies.
●The appropriate range of frequencies
is directed to each speaker by a
crossover circuit. The low pass filter
passes low frequencies while blocking
high frequencies. The high pass filter
has the opposite effect.
●A common crossover frequency is 3
kHz. Frequencies above this go mostly
to the tweeter while frequencies below
this go mostly to the woofer.
2 Low pass filter
●In the low pass filter high frequencies
in the input are short-circuited by the
capacitor, C, and do not reach the
output. R and C act as a potential
divider across the input with C offering
a much lower impedance to high
frequencies than to low ones therefore
there is very little high frequency
voltage in the output.
3 High pass filter
●In the high pass filter C blocks out the
low frequencies but allows high
frequencies to pass to the output.

R.C. network 2: AC
response
ELECTRICITY
1 Response of RC network
to varying input frequency
●The time constant, T, for an R.C.
network is equal to the product of the
capacitor (expressed in farads) and
resistor (expressed in ohms). When a
square wave is input to an R.C.
network the waveform of the output is
dependent on the frequency of the
alternating current.
●When the frequency is much less than
1/T the capacitor has sufficient time to
charge up and the output wave is very
similar in shape to the input wave. 
●When the frequency is much greater
than 1/T the capacitor has insufficient
time to charge up and the output wave
is triangular in form and greatly
smoothed. 
●When the frequency is equal to 1/T
the output waveform is triangular but
not symmetrical.
2 Spike generator
●When the input is at +5V the capacitor
becomes fully charged with positive
charge to the left and negative charge
to the right. When the input voltage
drops to 0V, the capacitor discharges
causing a negative spike as negative
charge leaves it.
●When the input voltage jumps from 0V
to 5V, negative charge is attracted to
the left of the capacitor as it charges
up and a positive spike occurs. As the
capacitor becomes more charged the
positive output falls.

Electricity in the car
1 Wiring diagram for car
●A car is supplied with electricity from a
storage battery or accumulator. The
car chassis is connected to the
negative terminal so circuits run from
the positive terminal through the
electrical device to earth on the
chassis.
●Electrical energy is used for the
ignition system and for a variety of
accessories including lighting and
windshield wipers. When the engine is
running it drives an alternator which
recharges the accumulator.
2 Starter motor circuit
●A current of the order of 100 A is
needed to drive the starter and thick
wires are needed to carry such a
current. To avoid having to run these
wires to the ignition switch, the high
current circuit is controlled by a low
current circuit using a solenoid.
●When the low current circuit is
completed by turning the ignition key,
the solenoid throws a switch which
completes the high current circuit
causing the starter to turn over the
engine until it starts running.
●Releasing the ignition key opens the
low current circuit and reverses the
action of the solenoid which, in turn,
opens the high current circuit.
3 Ignition circuit
●In a petrol engine, a mixture of petrol
vapor and air is ignited inside a series
of four (normally) cylinders using
spark plugs. 
●Current at a high potential difference
is provided by an ignition coil. It
passes through the spark plug causing
a spark to jump across a gap at its
base, igniting the gaseous mixture.
●The distributor and a series of high
tension leads determine the sequence
in which the spark plugs fire.

Circuit symbols 3
ELECTRONICS
Semiconductor
components
●Diodes and transistors are formed of
semiconductor materials such as
silicon and germanium crystals. The
material is treated in one of two ways.
Either an impurity such as arsenic is
added, to give the material an excess
of electrons, forming an n-type
semiconductor, or an impurity such as
boron is added to give the material
fewer electrons (p-type
semiconductor).
● A diode consists of an n-type layer
fixed to a p-type layer.
● The connector from the p-type layer
forms the anode and that from the n-
type layer forms the cathode. When
connected in a circuit in this way
(forward bias), charge carriers in the
diode move to the junction between
the layers and current flows. If the
diode is connected the opposite way,
(reverse bias) either no current flows
or, if a large voltage is applied, the
diode breaks down.
● A bipolar transistor consists of three
layers – either a layer of p-type
material sandwiched between two n-
type layers (n-p-n junction transistor)
or a layer of n-type sandwiched
between two p-type layers (p-n-p
junction transistor). Each layer has a
connector, they are called the base,
the collector and the emitter.
Variability of components
● The function of many electronic
circuits depends on small changes
caused by sensors which operate
within certain known ranges, such as
thermistors, whose resistance falls
with increased temperature. In order
for circuits to function correctly in
response to signals from sensors,
some components, such as resistors
can be adjusted to particular values.

Semiconductor diodes
1 Diode
●A diode allows current to pass in one
direction only. The end marked with a
band is the cathode which should be
connected to the cell’s negative
terminal. The other end (anode)
should be connected to the cell’s
positive terminal.
● When anode and cathode are
connected to a cell’s positive and
negative terminals the diode is
forward biased. Its resistance is very
low and current flows through it.
Conventional current travels in the
direction of the arrow in the diode
symbol.
● When the diode is connected in the
opposite orientation it is said to be
reverse biased. It has a very high
resistance and does not conduct.
● When a diode is forward biased it does
not begin to conduct until the turn-on
voltage (about 0.6 V for silicon diodes
and 0.1 V for germanium diodes) is
reached. A small increase in voltage
then causes a large increase in current.
● Every diode has a maximum forward
current (forward current rating) which
should not be exceeded or the diode
overheats and may be destroyed.
2 LED
●A light emitting diode (LED) is made
from gallium arsenide phosphide.
LEDs look like tiny filament lamps and
may emit red, yellow or green light
when forward biased. They do not
emit light when reverse biased.
●An LED should not be connected into
a circuit without a series resistor to
limit the current or it could be
destroyed.
●LEDs are used as indicator or signal
lamps in electronic equipment. They
are smaller, more reliable, last longer,
respond faster and need less current
than filament lamps.

Transistors
ELECTRONICS
1 Bipolar transistor
●A bipolar transistor has three
connections—the collector (C), the
base (B) and the emitter (E). 
●There are two main bipolar transistor
types; the n-p-n and the p-n-p type. 
●In the n-p-n type the base current
enters by B and leaves by E. At the
same time the collector current enters
by C and leaves by E. The emitter
current is a combination of the base
and collector currents.
● When the switch is open the base
current is zero. Neither lamp lights up
indicating that the collector current is
also zero although the battery is
connected across the collector and
emitter.
● When the switch is closed the base is
connected to the positive terminal of
the battery through the resistor. L2
lights up but not L1 showing that the
collector current is much greater than
the base current, which is too small to
illuminate L1.
● If the base current is considered as the
transistor’s input and the collector
current its output, the transistor acts
as an amplifier since the collector
current is greater than the base
current. The collector current tends to
be 10 to 1000 times greater than the
base current. The bipolar transistor is
a current control device.
2 Field effect transistor
●A field effect transistor (FET) has three
connections—the drain (D), the gate
(G) and the source (S).
●In an FET the input voltage at the gate
controls the output current at the
drain. The input current is usually
negligible due to the high input
resistance of the FET compared to a
bipolar transistor.

Integrated circuits
1 Integrated circuit
●An integrated circuit consists of
integrated rather than discrete
electronic components. A single
integrated circuit may contain
thousands of diodes, resistors,
transistors and small capacitors, all
etched onto a small chip of silicon. 
2 Analog signal
●In linear and analog integrated circuits
signals are often electrical
representations of physical quantities,
such as sound, which change
continuously and smoothly over a
range of values between some
minimum and maximum points.
●This type of integrated circuit includes
many kinds of amplifier circuit
including the operational amplifier
or op amp.
3 Digital
●Digital integrated circuits deal with
signals which can have one of only two
possible outputs; low (near 0 V) and
high (near the supply voltage, typically
5 V).
●This type of integrated circuit includes
logic gates, memories and
microprocessors.

Logic gates and their

ELECTRONICS
1 Logic gates
●The input to a logic gate can have only
one of two values. It can be low e.g.
near 0 V and indicated by “0,” or it can
be high e.g. close to the supply voltage
of typically 5-6 V and indicated by “1.”
● A truth table for a logic gate indicates
the output for all possible inputs.
● Different logic gates are different
shapes and the type is sometimes
written on them in circuit diagrams.
2 Logic gates with truth
tables
●AND gate—output is only high when
both inputs are high, otherwise the
output is low. A and B is written A.B.
● NAND (NOT AND) gate—logic output
of any logic gate is reversed if the
symbol is modified by adding a small
circle to the base of the output.
Output is low when both inputs are
high. For all other combinations of
input output is high.
● OR gate—logic output is high if either
or both of the inputs are low. A or B is
written A+B.
● NOR (NOT OR) gate—logic output is
the reverse of an OR gate.
● EXOR (exclusive OR) gate—output is
high when either input is high but not
when both are high.
● NEXOR (NOT exclusive OR) gate—
logic output is the reverse of an
exclusive OR gate.
● NOT gate—sometimes called an
inverter since output is always the
logical opposite to the input. Output is
high when inputs are low, and low
when inputs are high.
● NOT gate from NAND gate—the
inputs of a NAND gate can be linked to
form a gate which has the same logic
as a NOT gate. 
● NOT gate from NOR gate—the inputs
of a NOR gate can be linked to form a
NOT gate.

●Each state is stable (bistable). A state is
retained or stored until the bistable is
triggered when one output flips from
0 to 1 and the other flops from 1 to 0

1 Burglar alarm
●The light-dependent resistor (LDR)
and the adjacent resistor act as a
potential divider. In the dark the
resistance of the LDR is high and both
inputs to the NAND gate are high and
the output is 0.
●When light shines on the LDR its
resistance drops and that input to the
NAND gate becomes low. The result is
an output of 1 which causes the
buzzer to sound.
2 Automatic night light
●During the day the LDR is illuminated
and its resistance is low. The low input
to the first NAND gate is inverted to
give a high input to the second NAND
gate. The high input to the second
NAND gate is inverted to give a low
output so the LED is not lit.
●As it goes dark the resistance of the
LDR rises and gives a high input to the
first NAND gate. This is inverted,
giving a low input to the second
inverting NAND gate. The resulting
high output from the second NAND
gate turns the LED on.

1 Switch for electric motor
●With the switch open, voltage across
the NAND gate is high. This provides a
low input to the NOT gate. The NOT
gate provides a high output which
activates the relay, completing the
motor circuit.
●With the switch closed, voltage across
the NAND gate is low. This provides a
high input to the NOT gate. The NOT
gate provides a low output which
deactivates the relay, switching off the
motor.
2 Fire alarm
●The resistance of a thermistor falls
with increasing temperature.
●The resistor and thermistor act as
potential dividers. At low temperatures
the thermistor’s resistance is high,
thus the input to the NAND gate is
high. The NAND gate acts as an
inverter so its output is low.
●If there is a fire the thermistor’s
resistance falls. The input to the NAND
gate becomes low, its output  high and
the buzzer is turned on.
3 Length detector
●The resistance of a light dependant
resistor (LDR) falls with increasing
brightness.
●When both LDRs are dark, voltage
across them is high and inputs to the
NAND gate are both high. This
produces a high output at the second
NAND gate, sounding the buzzer.
●If one LDR is moved towards a light its
resistance falls, as does the voltage
across it. When one input to the
NAND gate is low its output is high;
output of the second NAND gate will
be low and the buzzer will not sound.

Sequential logic 1: the
bistable
The bistable
●Bistables are used as latches, in
counters, registers and memories.
●An R-S bistable has two inputs, R (for
RESET), and S (for SET) and two
outputs Q and Q.
1 S-R flip-flop
●Using NOR gates—An R-S bistable can
be made from two NOR gates
connected so that the output from
each gate is fed back as the input of
the other.
● Using NAND gates—An R-S bistable
can be made from two similarly
connected NAND gates.
● Truth table—when S is at logic 1 and R
is at logic 0 the bistable is in one stable
state in which Q is at logic 1 and Q is
at logic 0. Even if R now becomes logic
1 the same state remains.
When R is at logic 1 and S is at logic 0
the bistable flips into its second stable
state in which Q is at logic 0 and
Q is at logic 1. Even if S now becomes
logic 1 the same state remains.
When S and R are both at logic 1, Q
and Q can be at either logic 1 or 0
depending on the state before this
input condition existed. The previous
output state is retained. 
2 Reset-set (R-S) flip-flop
●The logic of the inputs can be reversed
using inverters.

ELECTRONICS
1 The latched burglar
alarm
●In many latches when the input goes
low the output goes high. The output
then stays high no matter what
happens at the input i.e. it is latched
to a high output. The output can only
be reset to low by a reset switch.
●In this circuit the two NAND gates
form an R-S bistable. Assuming that
the inputs to the upper NAND gate are
1 and 1, the output will be 0 and the
alarm does not sound.
●When the trip switch is closed the
inputs to the upper NAND gate now
become 0 and 1. The output is now 1
and the alarm rings.
●The inputs to the lower NAND gate
become 1 and 1 giving an output of 0.
This feeds back to the upper NAND
gate so the inputs are 0 and 0 and the
output remains 1.
●If the trip switch is immediately
opened the inputs to the upper NAND
gate are 1 and 0 so the output remains
at 1 and the alarm continues to ring.
●The alarm can only be switched off by
closing the reset switch. When this
switch is closed the inputs to the
lower NAND gate become 1 and 0 and
the output becomes 1. This output
feeds back to the upper NAND gate
changing its inputs to 1 and 1. The
output becomes 0 and the alarm
ceases to sound.
2 Reversing an electric
motor
●The two NAND gates form an R-S
bistable. When the set switch is closed
one of the relays is activated and the
motor starts to rotate in one direction,
continuing to do so even if the set
switch is opened.
●When the reset switch is closed the
first relay is deactivated and the
second relay is activated, which
reverses the direction of the motor’s
rotation.

Clocked logic
1 The clocked bistable
●Clock pulses are supplied by a pulse
generator. This could be a mechanical
switch turning a d.c. supply on and off
or it could be a crystal-controlled
oscillator which supplies a steady
repetition frequency.
●Pulses should have a good square
wave form i.e. they should have a fast
rise and fall time. Any switches must
be debounced.
2 Timing diagram for
clocked bistable
●Each time the pulse falls it causes the
bistable to toggle. The first pulse
leaves Q = 1 and Q = 0. During
second clock pulse logic of outputs is
reversed—Q = 0 and Q = 1. Toggling
continues with each pulse input.
3 De-bouncing using logic
gates
●More than one pulse may result from
using a mechanical to change the state
of a bistable, due to the metal switch
contacts not staying together at first
but bouncing off each other.
●The effect of bounce contact is
eliminated by using an R-S bistable in
the debouncing circuit. When the
switch is moved from R to S, the
output Q remains at logic 0 even if
bouncing occurs.
4 Circuit symbol for
clocked flip-flop
●Circuit symbol for an R-S bistable is
modified to show a clocked flip-flop.
5 D-type flip-flop used as
clocked bistable
●In a D-type bistable one bit of data 
(0 or 1) is input at D for processing by
the bistable. Pulses are applied to the
clock input to control exactly when D
input is processed. S is the set input
allowing Q to be set to 1. R is the reset
input allowing Q to be set to 0.

ELECTRONICS
1&2 Sequential traffic
lights
●This type of bistable is rising-edge
triggered. The change in voltage as the
clock pulse rises from logic 0 to logic 1
changes the output logic.
●As clock voltage rises, output at Q is
logic 1 and the red light shines. While
clock is at logic 1 yellow light stays off
(logic 1 is inverted to logic 0 by upper
NOR gate). Inputs to lower NOR gate
are 1 and 0, giving output 0 and green
light stays off.
●As clock voltage falls to 0, output at Q
remains 1, red light stays shining, but
logic 0 is inverted to 1 by upper NOR
gate and the yellow light comes on.
Inputs to the lower NOR gate are now
1 and 1, giving output of 0 so green
light stays off.
●When clock voltage rises to logic 1
again, output at Q becomes logic 0
and the red light goes off. The logic 1
is inverted to logic 0 by the upper
NOR gate and the yellow light goes off.
Inputs to lower NOR gate are now 0
and 0, giving output of 1, turning the
green light on.
3 Dual system traffic lights
●Circuit containing several clocked
bistables and NOR gates provides a
dual system of traffic lights. Sequences
are off-set—as one set of lights
changes from red to green the other
changes from green to red.
4 Interval timer
●When light shines on LDR1 its
resistance falls and input to upper
NAND gate becomes logic 0. This is
inverted to give output of logic 1
which sets the bistable. Output at Q is
logic 1 and the counter starts. 
●When the light moves from LDR1 to
LDR2, resistance of the former rises
while that of the latter falls, resetting
the bistable, giving an output of logic 0
at Q which stops the counter.

1 Switching machine off for
5 s in every 20s
●The binary counter and timed
bistables provide an output of 0 for 15
out of every 20 second period. This is
inverted by the NOT gate which
activates the relay, turning the motor
on. 
●For the remaining 5 seconds the
output is 1. This is inverted by the
NOT gate and thus deactivates the
relay turning the motor off.
2 Reversing action of food 
mixer every 5 s
●This type of circuit is sometimes used
in food mixers. Activating the relay
does not turn the motor on or off, but
reverses the direction of the current
and thus the direction in which the
motor rotates.
3 Flashing a lamp
●The output from a binary counter can
be used to turn a lamp on and off a
given number of times. When the
switch is turned on in this circuit the
lamp flashes 6 times.
4 Automatic light buoy
●Flashing lamps have many possible
applications including providing
warnings such as buoys which mark
the position of an underwater hazard.
The circuit can be modified using an
LDR so that the light only flashes when
it is dark which preserves the battery.
5 Batch counter
●Batches of articles can be counted
either by depressing switches manually
or having an arrangement in which a
switch is triggered each time an article
passes a sensor.

Operational amplifiers 1
1 Schematic circuit of the
741 op-amp chip
●Operational amplifiers or op-amps
have many uses including as high gain
voltage amplifiers of both a.c. and d.c.
and as switches.
●The 741 op-amp chip contains around
20 transistors together with resistors
and capacitors all etched onto a
silicon chip. It requires a dual power
supply which gives equal positive and
negative voltages; +Vs, 0 and –Vs
where typically +Vs = +15 V and
–Vs = -15 V. The centre point of the
power supply, 0 V, is common to both
the input and output circuits.
2 Circuit symbol for 
op-amp
●There is one output and two inputs;
an inverting input (marked -) and a
non-inverting input (marked +). 
The – and + input signs should not be
confused with the polarity of the
power supplies.
3 Transfer characteristic
●The polarity of a voltage applied at the
inverting input is reversed at the
output. A voltage applied at the non-
inverting input gives an amplified
voltage of the same polarity.
●If V2 > V1 i.e. the non-inverting input is
greater than the inverting input then
Vout is always positive.
●If V1 > V2 i.e. the inverting input is
greater than the non-inverting input
then Vout is always negative.
●If V1 = V2 then Vout = 0.
●An op-amp acts as a differential voltage
amplifier. It amplifies the difference
between V1 and V2.
● A and B show where saturation starts.

1 Amplifier with negative
feedback
●When an op-amp is used as an
amplifier the output is fed back to the
inverting input. The voltage at the
output is of opposite polarity to the
one from which the feedback was
taken, thus the output and the gain of
the amplifier is reduced i.e. the
feedback is negative. 
●Although negative feedback reduces
the gain of the amplifier it results in a
more stable amplifier whose gain can
be accurately predicted. The amplifier
has a better frequency response and
output distortion is reduced.
2 Non-inverting amplifier
●In a non-inverting amplifier the input
voltage is applied to the non-inverting
input of the op-amp. The result is an
output voltage of the same polarity as
the input voltage. 
●Negative feedback is obtained by
feeding back to the inverting input a
fraction of the output voltage
developed across Ri in the potential
divider formed by the resistors.
3 Voltage follower
●A voltage follower is a special case of
the non-inverting amplifier in which all
of the output is fed back to the
inverting input. The output voltage is
equal to the input voltage but the
circuit has an extremely high input
impedance and low output impedance
making it suitable as a buffer amplifier
to match a high impedance source
with a low impedance load.
4 Summing amplifier
●When an op-amp is connected as a
multi-input amplifier it can be used to
add a number of voltages, either d.c.
or a.c. This type of circuit is used as a
mixer in audio applications to combine
the outputs of microphones, electrical
instruments and special effects.

Operational amplifiers 3
1 Simple integrating circuit
●An op-amp is the basis of a ramp
generator for producing a voltage with
a sawtooth waveform. 
●When steady input voltage Vin is
applied through resistor R, after time 
t (s) the output voltage Vout is
Vout = - (1/CR) Vin dt
where C is in F and R is in M. Since
the inverting input is used, negative
sign indicates that output voltage is
negative if input voltage is positive and
vice versa.
2 Output of the integrator
●If input voltage of -3 V is applied,
output voltage rises by +3 V per
second. If a power supply of ±15 V is
used the output voltage will be close
to 15 V after 5 seconds when the op-
amp becomes saturated. Input voltage
is thus added up or integrated over
time t to give a ramp voltage waveform
whose slope is –Vin when CR=1s.
●To reset output voltage to zero when it
reaches its maximum value a
transistor can be connected across the
capacitor to short circuit the capacitor
causing the output voltage to fall to 0
V when it receives a reset pulse.
3 Low temperature alarm
●An op-amp can act as a switch in a
similar way to a transistor. 
●The thermistor and the resistor R form
a potential divider across the 15 V
supply. The op-amp compares the
voltage V1 at the potential divider
junction with V2 which is 0 V.
●If the temperature falls below a certain
value (determined by setting R) the
thermistor’s resistance becomes
greater than that of R. There is a
greater voltage drop across the
thermistor than R thus V1 becomes
negative. V2 > V1 which switches Vout
from around -15 V to + 15 V lighting
the LED.

●Equations of the form

and are solved by the process of

●An op-amp is able to add up or
integrate voltage over time and can
therefore be used to solve differential
equations.
1 Solving the differential
equation
●The feedback to the first op-amp is to
the inverting input thus a positive
input provides an output which is
negative.
●The feedback to the second op-amp is
also to the inverting input thus the
output is also inverted. Since the input
is negative, the output is inverted and
therefore is positive.
2 Producing oscillations
●Where the output from the second op-
amp is negative, it is necessary to add
a third op-amp which acts as an
inverter to provide a positive output
for display on a cathode ray
oscilloscope.

Op-amp as oscillator
●An op-amp can become an oscillator
by feeding back the output to the
input in such a way as to ensure that
the feedback is in phase with the input
i.e. positive, and that it is sufficient to
make good energy losses in the circuit
so the amplified output consists of
undamped electrical oscillations.
●The action of the oscillator is to supply
its own input and convert d.c. from
the power supply to a.c. The resulting
a.c. can have a variety of waveforms
depending on the circuit.
1 Wien network and
oscillator
●Sine waves in the audio frequency
range (20–20,000 Hz) can be
generated by an op-amp using a Wien
network circuit. 
●To obtain oscillations the network is
used with the non-inverting input of
the op-amp giving an output to the
Wien network in phase with its input. 
2 Op-amp astable
multivibrator
●An op-amp voltage comparator in its
saturated condition can work as an
oscillator. 
●Suppose output voltage V0 is initially
positive. A fraction of V0, V2, is fed
back to the non-inverting input. V0 is
also fed back to the inverting input via
resistor R1, causing V1 to rise as
capacitor C1 is charged.
●When V1 becomes greater than V2, the
op-amp switches into negative
saturation and V0 is negative. 
●Capacitor C1 now starts charging in the
opposite direction causing V1 to fall
rapidly until eventually becoming less
than V2. The op-amp then switches
into positive saturation and V0 is
positive. This continues indefinitely at
a frequency determined by the value
of the capacitor.

Rectifier circuits
ELECTRONICS
a.c. rectification
●A diode only allows current to flow in
one direction, so diodes can rectify, or
convert, alternating to direct current. 
1 Half-wave rectification
●The negative half cycle of the a.c. is
removed to give a varying d.c. Half-
wave rectification is wasteful since half
the electrical energy is lost as heat
from the diode. Many loads require
steadier d.c. than is produced by half-
wave rectification.
2 Full-wave rectification
●In the center tap transformer, current
passes through the upper diode on
the first half of the cycle and through
the lower diode on the second. 
●The bridge rectifier is a bridge of four
diodes. Current passes through
opposite pairs of diodes during each
alternating current half cycle.
●The negative half cycle of a.c. becomes
positive, resulting in a varying d.c. in
which none of the a.c. is lost.
3 Smoothing
●Variations in d.c. are smoothed by
connecting a large electrolytic
capacitor across the load. The
capacitor charges as the current rises,
and discharges as it falls. The capacitor
smoothes the current by reducing the
height of the current peaks while
eliminating the points where current is
zero.
●The amplitude of the ripple voltage is
decreased if the value of the capacitor
is increased A greater charge is held
and the potential difference across the
capacitor falls less when it supplies
current. This amplitude also decreases
when the output current drawn by the
load decreases, because the potential
difference across a capacitor is affected
less the smaller the current drawn
from it.

The microprocessor
1 Basic computer
interconnections
●A computer consists of input devices,
such as a keyboard; output devices,
such as a visual display unit (VDU) and
a printer; a central processing unit
(CPU) and memory. The CPU is
connected to other parts of the system
by three sets of wires called buses
because they transport information.
●A clock generates timing pulses at
frequencies of several megahertz
which are used to synchronize the
computer’s operations so that they
take place at the correct time and in
the correct sequence.
2 Interconnection via a bus
●The one-way address bus carries
signals from the CPU enabling it to
access data in specific locations in the
memory. 
●The data bus allows two-way transfer
of data between the CPU and other
parts of the system.
●The control bus transmits timing and
control signals to keep the different
parts of the system working in step.
3 Use of a tristate
●To prevent interference between those
parts of the system that are not
sending signals to the bus and those
that are, all parts have a tristate gate in
their output. Each gate is enabled or
disabled by a control unit.
●When the tristate gate is enabled, the
output is low or high and signals can
be sent to, or received from the bus.
●When the tristate gate is disabled, the
output has such a high impedance that
it is effectively disconnected from the
bus and can neither receive or send
signals. It thus does not upset signals
already passing along the bus.
● Components are connected to the bus
via tristate buffers.
● A control bus is used to enable the
buffers.

Analog and digital
signals 
ELECTRONICS
Information transmission
●Information can be represented and
transmitted electrically either as an
analog or as a digital signal.
1 Analog signal
●An analog signal represents a physical
quantity which can vary continuously
with time.
●The information carried by an analog
signal is in the amplitude and
waveform of the physical quantity.
2 Digital signal
●A digital signal consists of a sequence
of binary code with 1 and 0
representing high and low voltages. 
●Information in the signal is coded
using the American Standard Code for
Information Interchange (ASCII), a
code consisting of 8 digits or bits. 
3 Advantages of digital
signal
●Signals weaken as they travel and
require amplification. They also pick
up stray voltages and currents which
form noise, distorting the signal. 
● Noise is amplified when analog signals
are amplified. 
● Digital signals can be regenerated as
clean, noise free pulses.
4 Analog to digital
conversion
●The analog voltage is divided into a
number of levels. Measurements are
taken regularly to find the level. Each
level is represented by a binary code. A
three-bit code can represent 23 = 8
levels (0–7).
●The accuracy of the conversion
increases with the number of voltage
levels and the frequency of sampling.

UNITS AND MEASUREMENTS
1 Linear relationship
●A straight-line graph indicates that one
variable is directly proportional to
another. The mass of a piece of iron is
directly proportional to its volume;
doubling the volume doubles the
mass.
●Since density = mass / volume, the
gradient of the graph gives the density
of iron; 31.6 / 4 = 7.9 kg m-3.
2 Square relationship
●The area of a square is equal to the
product of its two sides (i.e., the area
of a square is proportional to the
square of its length).
3 Cubic relationship
●The volume of a cube is equal to the
product of its three sides (i.e., the
volume of a cube is proportional to
the cube of its length).
4 Similar figures
●If the linear dimensions of similar
objects are in the ratio of 1:x then the
ratio of their areas will be 1:x2. If the
length of the larger figure is twice that
of the smaller figure its area will be
four times greater than the smaller
figure.
●For similar 3-dimensional objects if the
linear dimensions are in the ratio 1:x
then the ratio of their volumes will be
1:x3.
5 Inverse-square
relationship
●According to the inverse-square law,
the intensity of an effect is reduced in
inverse proportion to the square of
the distance from the source. This law
is true for most types of radiations,
including light, and fields.
●From the graph, it can be seen that
light intensity 10 m from the light
source is four times greater than the
intensity at 20 m.

UNITS AND MEASUREMENTS
1 Uniform and non-uniform
motion
●Distance traveled by a body in uniform
motion is directly proportional to
time. 
●Distance traveled per unit time by a
body in non-uniform motion may
continually increase or decrease.
2 Constant speed
●Speed is the ratio distance:time. A
body in uniform motion moves at a
constant speed.
3 Constant acceleration
●The speed of a body moving with
constant acceleration increases at a
uniform rate. Acceleration is the ratio
speed:time. The graph of speed
against time is a straight line (speed is
directly proportional to time). 
4 Falling object
●A falling object is acted on by gravity
pulling it downwards, and by air
friction, opposing its movement.
●Gravity is initially dominant and the
object’s speed increases. Air friction
increases as the object moves faster,
until it equals the force of gravity.
There is no net acceleration and the
object continues falling at a constant
speed—its terminal velocity.
5 Bouncing ball
●The ball accelerates as it is pulled
towards the ground by gravity; its
speed rapidly falls to zero when it hits
the ground. It leaves the ground
moving at maximum speed in the
opposite direction then slows as it
reaches maximum height where it
momentarily stops. 
●Some energy is lost as heat to the
ground each time this is repeated so
the ball eventually stops bouncing.

UNITS AND MEASUREMENTS
1 Position–time graph for
particle with continuously
changing velocity
●Determination of the particle’s
velocity at point d.
●Velocity is the ratio of displacement
(change of position) to time; velocity
in meters per second (ms-1) =
displacement in meters (m) / time in
seconds (s) 
●If a particle’s velocity is calculated
using the distance traveled over a
period of time, the resulting figure is
actually the average velocity over that
time period. It may be that the body
never actually travels at this velocity
during the particular time period.
2 Considering the
particle’s instantaneous
velocity
● The particle’s actual velocity at a
particular point in time is called its
instantaneous velocity. This can only
be found by considering a very small
change in displacement over a very
short time period.

1 Gradient of position–time
graph
●Velocity is given by the gradient of a
position–time graph.
●The Greek prefix delta,  x, its lower
case alternative , or the letters D or d
are used to denote a small change in a
variable.
● x is thus a small change in
displacement during t, a small
change in time.
●Instantaneous velocity at a point in
time can be obtained by finding the
gradient of the curve at that point in
time.
● If the scale of the graph is magnified, it
can be seen that its gradient at point d
is approximately equal to x/t where
x is the distance between points a
and b, and t is the time interval
between these points.
2 Tangent to position–time
graph
● Provided x and t are small enough,
the section of the curve approximates
to a straight line and thus the gradient
at d equals the tangent drawn at that
point.

●Average velocity between points a and

2 Instantaneous velocity
●Instantaneous velocity at point e is
found by drawing the tangent to e,
ced.  
●Velocity is the gradient of this line
(32m / 60 s = 0.53 ms-1)
3 Instantaneous positive
acceleration
●Acceleration is the ratio of velocity to
time. Acceleration in meters per
second2 (ms2) = velocity in meters
(ms-1) / time in seconds (s)
●The acceleration of a body calculated
from its change in velocity over a
period of time gives the body’s
average acceleration over that time
period. It may be that the body never
actually accelerates at this rate at any
time during the time period.
●The actual acceleration at a particular
point in time is called the
instantaneous acceleration. It is found
by considering a very small change in
velocity over a very small period of
time.
●Acceleration is given by the slope of a
velocity–time graph. Instantaneous
acceleration at a point in time is
obtained by finding the gradient of the
curve at a point in time.
Tangent of f gives slope h/i

UNITS AND MEASUREMENTS
1 Position specified by two
coordinate numbers
●On a Cartesian axis the position of a
point is given by two coordinate
numbers or coordinates; one along the
horizontal (often designated x) axis
and one along the vertical (often
designated y) axis. The x coordinate is
always given first.
●The point where the axes intersect is
called the origin. The x coordinate is
positive to the right of the origin and
negative to the left of the origin. The y
coordinate is positive above the origin
and negative below the origin.
2 Position specified by
directed line segment or
position vector
●A point can also be defined by a
position vector. This is a straight line
from the origin to the point.
3 Displacement vector and
resultant
●A displacement vector has both
magnitude (length) and direction. It
can be represented by an arrow. The
sum, or resultant, or two vectors is
found by drawing the vectors as two
sides of a triangle. The resultant is
obtained by drawing in the third side.
4 Subtraction of two
vectors in a plane
●Reversing the arrow representing a
vector reverses the direction of the
vector but does not alter its
magnitude. If the vector b is
represented by an arrow pointing in
one direction, the vector -b is
represented by an arrow of equal
length pointing in the opposite
direction.

1 Vector addition
●If a swimmer attempts to cross a river
both the force created by the
swimming stroke and the flow of the
water act on him. Each force can be
represented by an arrow on a vector
diagram.
●If the swimmer sets off perpendicular
to the flow of the river he will arrive at
a point on the opposite bank
downstream from where he started. In
order to arrive at a point on the
opposite bank directly opposite where
he started, he needs to swim at a
suitable angle upstream.
2 Components and vectors
●Any vector can be resolved into a pair
of perpendicular vectors or
component vectors. If the vector, A,
makes an angle q with the horizontal
then the component vectors are Acosq
in the direction parallel to the
horizontal and Asinq in the direction
perpendicular to the horizontal.
3 Vectors in three
dimensions
●Motion in 3-dimensions can be
expressed as a combination of three
vectors in directions perpendicular to
each other.
4 Further illustrations of
components
●When a vector moves parallel to or
perpendicular to a line one or other of
the component vectors is equal to
zero since the angle is 0° in which case
sin 0° = 0, or 90° in which case cos 0°
= 0.

UNITS AND MEASUREMENTS
1 International System of
Units: base units
●Scientific quantities are measured
using the SI system (Système
International d’Unités). There are
seven base units—the meter, kilogram,
second, ampere, Kelvin, candela and
mole. All other SI units are derived
from these.
●The name of each unit is represented
by a symbol. Some units are named
after famous scientists. In this case the
name of the unit is written in lower
case while the symbol for the unit is
written as an upper case letter
●For example, thermodynamic
temperature is measured in kelvins but
the symbol for this unit is K; electrical
current is measured in amperes but
the symbol is A.
●The radian and the steradian are
supplementary SI units used in angular
measurement.

UNITS AND MEASUREMENTS
1 International System of
Units: derived units
● Most units are derived from two or
more of the seven base units.
● Some derived units are always
expressed in terms of base units. For
example: speed = distance expressed
in meters divided by time expressed in
seconds. The unit of speed is therefore
the meter per second or ms-1.
● Other derived units are named. For
example: pressure = force expressed
in newtons divided by area expressed
in square meters. The unit of area is
therefore the newton per square
meter or Nm-2 (although this is same
as the pascal or Pa).
● The same series of prefixes can be
added to any unit to change its value
by multiples of 10. For example, the
prefix kilo indicates a factor of 103 or
1,000, therefore 1 kilometer = 
1,000 meters. Similarly, the prefix
micro indicates a factor of 10-6
therefore  1 microgram = 
0.000 001 gram.
● In order to avoid confusion, the
correct use of upper case and lower
case for prefix symbols is important.
For example, m (milli) is the symbol
representing 10-3 while M (mega)
represents 106.

UNITS AND MEASUREMENTS
International System of
Units: some symbols and
conventions
● The scientific community generally
refers to certain quantities using
specific symbols such as l for length, 
r for radius, f for focal length. Such
lengths use the SI unit of
measurement, the meter.
● Some quantities use non-SI units but
are recognized for general use. For
example, the atomic mass unit is 1/12
the mass of one atom of carbon-12
(approximately 1.66 x 10-27 kg,
equivalent to the mass of a proton).
● The mole is defined as the amount of
a substance which contains the same
number of entities (for example atoms
or molecules) as there are atoms in
0.012 kg of carbon-12. This number
(6.023 x 1023) is also known as
Avogadro’s number. A mole of a
substance therefore is the amount of
the substance which contains 6.023 x
1023 particles of that substance.
● The half-life of a radioactive substance
(T1⁄2) is the time taken for one half of
the original quantity to decay. Half
lives vary from fractions of seconds to
millions of years.
