Emergent structures in the Ontological
model of the Lexical Concepts and 
Constructions
Or: how can some-thing arise from no-such-a-thing?
And what language has to do with it?

How does the science describe the world?
• Science is a formalized method of researching things and relations that exist in a reality.
Science

How do scientist do it?
• Analytic paradigm:
• Scientist describe a segment of
reality in terms of its components.
• Reduce the complex phenomena
into more simple phenomena
• more stable
• easier to predict
• Structural summarization
• Disciplinary perspectivization
Science

What are the effects of such a scientific paradigm?
• Every discipline produces its particular ontology:
• a set of concepts and categories in a subject domain that shows their
properties and relations between them
Science
Advantages
• Allows
for
a rich, detailed
and
structurally coherent description of
a domain
Disadvantages
•
Perspectives often not well interconnected
(without
bottom-up,
top-down
causal
relations)
•
Reductivist
Ontology
• Ontology is a prerequisite for a coherent disciplinary research in any domain

Interlude: Effects of a reductive scientific paradigm
• Every sociologist wants to become a psychologist
• Every psychologist wants to become a biologist
• Every biologist wants to become a physicist
• Every physicist wants to become a mathematician
• Every mathematician wants to become a god
Science
Ontology
A theory of everything (ToE), final theory, ultimate theory, or master 
theory is a hypothetical single, all-encompassing, coherent theoretical 
framework of physics that fully explains and links together all physical 
aspects of the universe
Theory of everything formula

How to deal with negative effects of perspectivization / 
reductionism?
Ontology
The solution:
• Meta-ontology that would combine all the
knowledge from particular ontologies.
• Meta-ontology is a prerequisite for a coherent
inter-dicsiplinary research.
The problem:
• How many things are there really?
• Can we produce a wholesome meta-ontology
model that could:
Ontology
describe connections / relations between domains A ∈B
distinguish emergence of distinct properties
A ≠B

The systemic paradigm of Emergence
Ontology
Latin emergere "bring forth, bring to light," intransitively "arise out or up, come forth, come up, come out, 
rise," from assimilated form of ex "out" (see ex-) + mergere "to dip, sink„ : rising from a liquid by virtue of buoyancy.

What is Emergence / emergent properties?
Ontology
The notion of emergence, or emergent properties, [is] 
one of the most important concepts in the modern 
theory of complexity and, more generally, in the 
systemic conception of life.
Emergent properties are the novel properties that arise 
when a higher level of complexity is reached by 
putting together components of lower complexity.

unifying vision. Cambridge University Press. P.155

Emergent properties are the novel properties that arise 
when a higher level of complexity is reached by 
putting together components of lower complexity. 
The properties are novel in the sense that they are not 
present in the parts: they emerge from the specific 
relationships and interactions among the parts in the 
organized ensemble.

Emergence examples
Ontology
• The solvent properties of water
neither hydrogen atoms nor oxygen atoms in isolation possesses solvent
properties and neither do they possess scaled-down versions of the 
properties. the solvent action seems to emerge from a non linear 
combination of the properties of hydrogen and oxygen 
• Lipids, cell, ant behaviour, nervous system, social systems
Emergent properties 
• product of the synergies between the parts 
• cannot be observed locally in subsystems but only as a global structure
Emergence

Why should a linguist care about a meta-Ontology?
Ontology
• Where is a language, or the language in the
overall schema of things?
• Does
language
emerge
out
of
nowhere,
biology, culture?
• Is
the
structure
of
language
(phonemes,
morphemes, words, idioms, ….) enough to
represent what language is, and what it is for?
• Is meaning a real thing? What kind of a thing?
• What do we do when we speak words?
Language
?

OMLCC
• The OMLCC models the knowledge 
derived from lexical concepts and 
constructions according to the 
systemic meta-theory grounded on 
the ontological relations in the 
world. 
• The epistemology of this meta-
description of lexical concepts and 
their relations assumes that 
• lexical concepts refer to the 
perceived, experienced and 
conceptualized things in the material, 
psychological and social domain.

OMLC
The emergence based ontological model of lexical concepts and 
constructions (OMLCC) :
• enables description of lexical concepts and linguistic usage in
ontology of things
• describes metonymic profiling as a function of meronymic relations
in the world
•
formalizes identification of metaphoric constructions 
and other types of figurative speech, (compare cross-
culturally metaphorical networks) as VIOLATION of
meronymic relations activated by constructions
•
reveals dynamics between different levels of emergent
properties
