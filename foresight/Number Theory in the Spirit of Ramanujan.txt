Preface 
Generally acknowledged IL'i India's greatest mathematician, Srinh'BSa 
Ramanujan is most ofull thought of as II Dumber theorist, althoU&h 
he made substantial contributions to a.nalysis and several other ar-
eas of mathematics. For most number theorists, when Ramanujan's 
name is mentioned, the partition and tau functions immediately come 
to mind. His ;nT,erest in these arithmetic funetio"" was inextricably 
intertwined with his primary interests of theta functions and other q-
series. In fact, most of Ramanujan's research in number theory arose 
out of q-se:ri ... and theta functioIL'l. Theta functioll.'l are the fundamen-
tal building blocks in the theory of elliptic functions, and Hamanujan 
independently de\'eloped his own theory of elliptic [unctions, which is 
quite unlike the classical theory. We do not fonnally define an eHipti\: 
function, but, roughly. elliptic functi011S are merom orphic functions 
with two linearly independen~ periods over the real numbers. The 
ooncept of double periodid~y is not used in this book, and, 1.0 the 
belt of our knowledge, Ramanujan ne"er utili~ this idea. 
The purpose of this book is 1.0 provide an introduction 1.0 this 
large eJ<pallSe of Ramanujan's work in number theory. Needless to 
say, we shall be able to cover only a wry small fraction of Ramanu-
jan's work on theta functions and q-selies and their collJlections with 
numoor theory. 1I""..,ver, aft", developing only a few facta .. bout

q-series and theta functions, we will be equipped to prove many in-
teresting theorelns. The arithmetic functions on which we focUil are 
the partition function p(n}. Ramanujan's tau function 1'(n), the OutD-
ber of representations of a posith"e integer" as a sum of 2k squares 
denoted by r2~ (n), and other arithmetic functions closely allied to 
T2k(n). Most of the material upon wbich we draw can be found in 
Ramanujan'. published papenl on p(n) and 1'(n). the later chaprers 
in his second notebook, his lost norebook, and his handWTitren man-
uscript on p(n) and 1'(n) published with his lost norebook. We em-
phasize that Ramanujan left behJnd few of his proofs, especially for 
his claims in his notebooks and lost notebook. Thus. for many of the 
theorems that we discuss, we do not kno"" Ramanujan's proofs. This 
is particularly true for the theorems OIl sums of squares and similar 
arithmetic functions that 'I!."e prm ... in Chapter 3. 
The requirements for reading and understanding the material in 
this book are relatively modest. An ur.dergraduare course in elemen-
tary number theory is advisable. For some of the analytic arguments, 
a solid undergraduate course in comp!ex analysis is essential. How-
e\"Cr, the occasions when deep analytical rigor is needed are few, and 
so readers who do not have a stroog background in analysis can sim· 
ply verify formally the needed manipulations. Our intent here is not 
to gi'''' a rigorous course in analysis but to emphasize the most impor· 
tant ideas about q-series and theta functions and how they interpla}' 
with number theory. This book should be suitable for junior and 
senior undergraduates and beginning , raduate students. 
Since many readers may not be frnliliar with Ramanujan's life, 
'I!."e begin with a short account of his life where readers learn about 
the r>Otebooks and lost notebook in which he recorded his theorems 
owr several years. We provide brief lustories, first of tbe Mordinary" 
notebooks, and second of the lost notebook. After these biographical 
and historical uarrations, we provide short summaries of the book's 
$C"en chapters. 
Rarnanujan was born on December 22. 1887 In the horne of his 
maternal grandmother in Erode, located in the southern Indian state 
of Tamil Nadu. After a few months, his mother, Komalatlllllmal. re-
turned with her son to her home in Kumbakonam approximately 160

miles south·south"'....st; of Madras. whfre her husba.nd was a clerk in 
the office of a cloth merchant. At the age of twelve, Ramanujan bor. 
rov.'ed a copy of the second part of Loney's Pwne 1ligonomelry (1491 
from an older student and worked all the prohlems in it. This longtime 
popular textbook in India has much mOfe in it than its title suggests. 
For example, infinite series and elementary functioDl! of a CQmplex 
..,..riahle are two of its topics. At the age of about fifteen, he oorro"''ed 
from the Kumbakonam College library a ropy of C. S. Carr'$ A Syn· 
OP$i$ of Elementary Resul/d in Pure Malherrwlics (64J, which scn'ed 
fIj; his primary source for learning matllematics. Carr was a tutor io 
London and compiled this compendium of 4417 results (with very few 
proofs) to facilitate his tutorini1:. At the ai1:e of sixteen, Ramanujan 
enter«! the Government College in Kumbakooam. By that time, Ra· 
manujan was completely devoted to mathematics and consequently 
failed his examinations at (.he end of his first year, because he would 
not study any other subje.::t. He therefore lost his scholarship and, 
because his family Wflj; poor, was force;! to terminate his formal edu· 
cation. He later t,,~ce tried to obtain an education at Pachaiyappa's 
College in Madras. but each time he failed his examinatiOIlll. 
After leaving the Government CoHege in Kumbakonam, Ramanu· 
ja.n de\"Oted all of his time to mathematics, recording his reBUlts with· 
,.,,,!, " ........ r.. in nOf. ... hooho It w"" probably around th .. ag .. of sixt.een 
that Ramanujan began to record his mathematical discoveries in note-
books, although the elllries on magic squares in Chapter 1 in both his 
first and second notebooks likely emanate from his school days. Liv. 
ing in lXl"erty with no means of financial support, suffering at times 
from serious illnesses, and "'"(Irking in isolation. Ramanujan de,"Oted 
all of his efforts to mathematics and continued to record his discov· 
eries without proofs in notebooks for tbe next fi\'\) years_ In 1909, he 
married Janaki. who was only nine or ten years old. With mounting 
pressure to find a job, Ramanujan visited V. Ramaswami Ayyar. the 
founder of the Indian Mathematical Society. Ayyar contacted R R.a-
m1>Cha"d.a R.o.o. who agr~ to gi"<1 R.t..nanujan, who now hM ffio--W 
to Madras, a monthly stipend so that Ramanujan could con~inue his 
mathematical res<>arch unabated.

After being supported for about fifteen months, for reasons that 
a-re unclea.r, Ramanujan rcfuwd furthfi financia-l as:;istance and be--
came a clerk in the Madras !'ort nu,t Otfiw. This turned out to 
be a watershed in Ramanujan'6 career. Several pwple, including 
S. Narayana lyer, the Chief Acwuuta.llt, and Sir Fi-ancis Spring, the 
Cha-irma-n, offered suppart, and Ramallujan was persuaded to write 
English mathematicians a-bout his mathematical discoveries. Two 
of them, H. 1". Baker and E. W. liobson, evidently did not reply. 
M. J. M. Hill replied but was not enwuraging. But on January 16, 
1913, Ramanujan wrote G. H. Hardy, who responded immediately and 
encouragingly, inviting Ramanujan to come to Cambridge to develop 
his mathematical gifts_ Ramanujan and his family were Jyengars. a 
conservath'e branch in the Brahmin tradition. Travelling to a dis-
tant land would make a person unclean, and so Ramanujan's mother 
was particularly adamant about her son's not accepting Hardy's in· 
vitation. After a pilgrimage to Namool with S. N. lye.- and after 
Goddess Namagiri appeared in a dream to Komalatammal, Ramanu· 
jan received permission to tra\'eL So on March 17, 1914, Ramanujan 
boarded a passenger ship for England. 
At about this time, Ramanujan evidently stopped recording his 
theorems in notebooks, although II fe>,>- entries in his third notebook 
were undoubtedly recorded in England. That Ramanujan no longer 
conwntrated On logging entries in his notebooks is evident from two 
letters that he wrote to friends in Madras during his first year in 
England. In a lett.er of November 13, 1914 to his friend R. Krishna 
Ran [51 , pp_ 112- 113], Ramanujan confided, "I have changed my 
plan of publishing my results. I am not going to publish any of the 
old results in my not.ebooks till the war is over." And in a letter of 
January 7, 1915 to S. M. Subramanian [5 1. pp. 123~1 25 1 , Ramanujan 
admi~ted, ~ I am doing my work v.:.ry slowly_ '-Iy notebook is sleeping 
in a corner for these four or five monLhs. I am publishing only my 
present researches as ( ha\"e not yet pron.rl the results in my notebooks 
rigorously." 
Ramatlujan soon bocame famous iOT the papers he published in 
England, &:Jme of them coauthored wilh Ha.rdy. Olle of his most im· 
partant papers is [186), 1192, pp. 136-1621. in which he introduced

his famous tau function r(n), discussed in Chapter 2 of this book, and 
the Eisenstein series, P, Q, and R, which are introduced here in Chap-
ter 4 and which were key players in so much of his research. In their 
paper 11091, 1192, pp. 262- 275], Hardy and Ramanujan launched the 
ne'" field of probahilistic number theol)', which became an important 
hranch in number theory. In another paper 11101. 1192, pp. 276-
309J. in the course of ohtaining an allymptotic series for the partition 
function p{n). Hardy and Ramanujan introduced the circle method, 
which still today is the primary tool for analytically attacking prob.-
lems in additive number theol)'. The genesis of t he circle method can 
be fouod in Ramaoujan's notebooks 1193]. but unforlunat.ely it is 
most freQuently called the Hardy-Littlewood circle method today. [n 
the latter part of his Slay in England, Ramanujan wrote his famous 
papers on congruences for p(n) [188),1192, pp. 210-213] and 1190J, 
1192, p. 230), about which much is written in this book. 
Altbough Ramanujan ne,..,r doubted his decision to accept 
Hardy's invitation to Camhridge. not all Wall well with Ramanujan. 
World Wac I began shortly after his arrival, and being a ~trict veg~ 
etarian, he could not always ohtain familiar food and spices from 
India. On March 24, 1915, near the (lIld of his first wint.e. in Cam-
bridge, Ramanujan wrote his friend E. Vinayaka Row in Madrall [51, 
PI' 116- 117). "1 "''''" not well till the h<oginning of this U>rm ~ng tn 
the weatber and consequently I couldn't publish any thing for about 
5 mOnlhs.~ By the end of his third year in England, Ramanujan Wall 
critically ill, and, for the next two years, he was confiued to sanitari-
ums and nun;iug homes. 
R.amanujan's health turned slightly up"'ard when in 1918 he be-
came the second Indian to be elecU.>d as a Fellow of the R.oyaI Society 
and the first Indian to be chosen as a Fellow of 'Tlinity College. Af-
~r World War I ended, in ]919, Ram&nujan TCturned home, hut his 
health continued to det.erior8te, and on April 26, 1920 RamlUlujan 
died at the age of 32_ 
Doctors in both Eng]and and India had difficulty diagnosing Ra-
manujan's illness. He Wall treated for tuberculosis, but a se~..,re vi_

properly cleaning his cooking vessels, and a rare tropical disease were

other diagnOlSeS. However, D. A. B. Young 152, pp. 65- 75) made a 
careful examinatinn of al! extant records aud recorded symptoms of 
I{amanujau's iUuess and convincingly concluded that KamanuJan suf-
fered from hepatic amoebiasis (a l/aIasitic infection of the lh'er). Not 
only do all of Ramanujan's symptoms suggest this disease, but Ra-
manujan's medical history in India &Iso favors this diagnosis. Amoe-
biasis is a protowal infection of the large intestine that gi\'<lS rise to 
dysentery. In 1906 Ramanujan left home to attend Pachaiyappa's 
College in IIladras, where he COntracted a severe case of dysentery 
and had to return home for three months. Unless adequately treated, 
the infection is permanent, although the palient may go for long pe-
riods without exhibiting any symptoms. Relapses occur when the 
host-parasite relationship is disturbed, which likely happened when 
he endured a colder climate and perhaps inadequate nutrition after 
his arrh-al in England. The iIInes5 is difficult to diagnose. 
Our de$Cription of Ramanujan's life has been necessarily brief. 
For several years, the standard sourCes about RamRnujan's life ha.\'e 
been the obituaries of P. V. Seshu AiYilf. R. Ramachandra Rao, and 
Hardy, found in Ramanujan's Collected. Popers 1192) and Chapter 1 
of Hardy's book 1107). By far. the m05t comprehensive biography of 
Ramanujan has been written by R. Kanige! 1134). T he letters from 
and to Ramanujan are also a source of both mathematical and per-
sonal information about Ramanujan, And most of the extant lell.ers 
have been compiled with commentary by R. A. Rankin and the author 
(5 1). 
After Ramanujan died, Hardy strongly urged that Ramanujan's 
notebooks be edited and published. BJ' "editing ,~ Hardy meant that 
each claim made by Ramanujan in his notebooks should be examined 
and proved, if it cannot be found in the literature. Ramannjan, in 
fact, had left his first notebook wilh Hardy when he returned to India 
in 1919. and in 1923 Hardy wrote a paper (106), [108, pp. (i(l;'-516) 
about a chapler on hypergoometric series found in the first notebook. 
In ~hi8 p"per, Hardy poi"~cd ou~ t h.u R..arn""ujan hnd independently

SPIRIT OF RAMANUJAN 
Hardy sellt the first notebook t.o the University of 1>ladras where 
Ramallujan'sother notebooks and papers were being preserved. Plan8 
were undertaken to pUblish Ramanujan's collated papers and, 1KJSSi-
bly, Illi! notebooks and other manuscripts. Handwritten copies of the 
notebooks were sent to Hatdy along with other manuscripts and pa-
pers in 1923, but the papers were never returned to the Unh-ersity of 
Madras. It traJl.'ipired that Rarnanujan·s ColI«led Papers [192) "-ere 
published in 1927, but his notebooks and other manuscripts "-ere not 
published. 
Sometime in the late 1920s, G. N. Watson and B. M. Wilson 
began the task of editing Ramanujan's notebooks. The second note-
book. being a revised. elliarged edition of the first, was their r>rirnllry 
focus. Wilson was assigned Chapters 2- 14, and Watson was t.o exam-
ine Chapters 15- 21. Wilson devoted his efforts t.o this task until 1935, 
when he died from an infection at the eatly age of 38. Watson wrote 
o'·er 30 papers inspired by the notebooks before his interest evidentl)· 
waned in the late 1930s. T hus, the prQjoct W8.'l ne~-er completed. 
It was not until 1957 that the notebooks were made available 
to the public when the Tats Institu~ of Fundamental Researeh in 
Bombay published a photocopy edition [193), but no editing was un-
dertaken. The first notebook W&II pubEshed in volume I, and volume 
2 compri""" the """"nd ru>d third nO\.(lbooka. Tbe p.-.:tlCnt author un 
dertook the task of editing Ramanujan's notebooks in 1977. With the 
help of SC\-eral mathematicians, the author completed his work with 
the publication of his fifth volume [38) on the notebooks ill 1998. 
In the spring of 1976, George Andrews of Penn6yl\"ania State 
Unj'-ersity visited Trinity College, Cambridge, to examine the papers 
left by Waison. Among Watson's papers, he found a manuscript 
containing 138 pages in the handwriting of Ramanujan. [n view of the 
fame of Ramanujan's notebooks [193), it w&ll natural for Andrews to 
call this newly found manuscript "Ramanujan's lost not.ebook. ~ How 
did this manuscript reach 'n-inity College? 
Watson died in 1965 at the age of 79. Shortly thereafter, on sep-
arate occasions, J. M. Whittaker and R. A. Rankin visited Mrs. Wat-
son. Whittaker was a son of E. T. Whittaker, who coauthored with

WatsQn probably the m(>lt popular and frequently used text on anal-
ysis in the 20th century {221]. Rankin had succeeded Watson lIS 
Mason ProfffiSOr of Mathematics at the Unh~rsity of Birn,ingham, 
",here Watson sen-w fOT most of his CLreer, but was now Professor 
of Mathematics at the Uni,~rsity of Glasgow. Both Whittaker and 
Rankin went to Watson's att,<; office to ex&mine the papers len by 
him, and Whittaker found the aforementioned manuscript by Ra-
manujan. Rankin suggested to Mrs. Watson that he might sort her 
late husband's papers and send those worth preserving to Trinity Col. 
lege Library, Cambridge. During the next three yean;, Rankin sorted 
through Watson's papers sending them in batches to Trinity College 
Libr3l')', with Ramanujan's manuscript being sent on DeoJmber 26, 
1968. Not realizing the importance of Ramanujan's papers. neither 
Rankin nor Whittaker mentioned thelll in their obituaries of Wat-
son 1195), 1222). The next question is, How did Watson come into 
~on 
of this sheaf of 138 pages of Ramanujan's work? 
We mentioned above that in 1923 the University of Madras had 
sent a package of Ramanujan's papers to Hardy_ Most likely, this 
shipment contained the "lost notebook." Of the O\'t'r 30 papers that 
Watson wrote On Ramanujan's work, t"'X1 of his last papers were de-
'X1ted to Ramanujan's mock theta functions. which Ramanujan dis-
covered in t he last year of his life, ,,·hieh he described in a letter to 
lIardy only about three months before he died 151 , pp. 220--223), and 
which are also found in the lost notebook. In these two papers, Wat-
SOn made some conjectures about the existence of certain mock theta 
functions. [f he had the lost notebook at that time, he would ha'"e 
seen that his conjectures were COTn!Ct. Thus, probably sometime af-
ter Watson's intere;;t in Ramanujan's ,,-ork declined in the late 1930s, 
Hardy passed Ramauujan's papers to Walson. 
In early 1988, just after the centenary of Ramanujan's birth, 
Narosa Publishing House in New Delhi I'ublished a photocopy edition 
of the lost notebook 1194). Included ill this publicatinn are partial

The first chapter of this book is de\'Ot.OO to basic facts about 
q-series and theta functions, includi~ the q-binomial thoon:m, the 
J acobi triple product identity, the per.tagonal number theon:m, Ita-
manujan's IIp! summation theon:m, and the quintuple product iden-
tity. Many of the theorems pro .... ed in Chapter I can be found in 
Chapter 16 of Ramanujan'a second nmebook (193], (34). 
Chapter 2 focuses on congru,.,nces for the partition fun<;tion p(n) 
and Ramanujan's tau function T(n). Uuch of this material is taken 
from Ramanujan's handwritten manll-<cript on p(n) and T(n), which 
"'as first published in 1988 along with Ramanujan's lost notebook 
(1 94). Adding details to many of Ramanujan's proofs and discussing

expanded .... ersion of this manuscript. 
In his notebooks [193), Ramanujan recorded a large number of 
entries on Lambert series. These ider.tities for Lambert series were 
used by Ramanujan to establish theta function identities and fonnu-
las for the number of representations of all integer as a sum of a 
certain nWllbers of squares or of triangular numbers. We introduce 
readers to Lambert serie!! in Chapter J and establish many identi-
ties leading to form ulas for sums of squares and triangular numbers.

those manuscripts published with Ramanujan's lost notebook [194], 
[19, Chapter IS). His second notebook al&> contains a large number 
of such theorems. 
Eisenstein series permeate Ramanujan's notebooks (193] and loot 
notebook (194]. Much of our exposition 011 Eisenstein series in Chap-
t(!r 4, ho...-ever, is taken from Ramanujan's epic paper [186], [192, 
136- 162). One of Ramanujan's approaches t.o congruences for p(n) 
is based on Eisenat,.,in series, which we demollStrate at the doee of 
Chapter 4. 
In Chapter 5, we introduce readers to hypergoometric functions 
and elliptic integrals. OUT goal in this chapt(!r is to prove one of 
the most fundamental theorems of elliptic functions relating hyper-
geometric functiollS and elliptic integrals t.o theta functions. This 
theorem enables us \.0 express theta functions and Eisenstein series

at various argumentiJ in ltlnns of certain elliptic parameltlrs. Our 
exposition is derived from Chapter 17 of Ramanujan's second note-
book (19:1], [:14, Chapter 11), wheu, through" ","ci"" of preliminary 
lemmas, Ramanujan leads us to the aforementioned key theorem. 
Applications of the aforementioned representations for Eisenstein 
series and theta functions form the w ntent of Chapter 6. First, we 
retuTll to the topic of sums of Squares and demonstrate how the for-
mulall for Eisenstein series lead to short proofs of some of the results 
from Chapler 3. However, most of OIapter 6 ;., de\"Oted to modu-
lILT equatioJtll, a topic to which Ramanujan made more contributions 
than any other mathematician. Chapters 19-21 in hili second note-
book are devoted to modular equations, and Our short introduction 
to this wpic is drawn from our previous account of Ramanujan's work 
iu these chapters [34]. 
One of Ramanujan's favorite topics was the Rogers-Ramanujan 
continued fraction, the foc;us of Chapter 1. Because we wish to share 
$0 mucl! about this wntinued fTaction with readers and because the 
length of the chapter would be prohibiti'", if we proved all theorems 
offered in this chapter, we forego $Orne of the proofs. H(U,:e\'el", we do

a!"1l not familiar with infinite product.. A reader desiring to learn a 
few basic fact. abont the convergence of infinite products may con-
suit" good text On complex analysis, such as that of N. Levinson 
and R. Redheffer [142. pp. 382- 38,)], for basic properties of infinite 
products. In particular, all the infinite products in the present \.ext 
converge absolut.ely and uniformly on compact subsets of Iql < I. In 
particular, taking logarithms of infinite products and diife!"1lntiating 
the resulting series t.efmwise is permitted. At first, you may flOd that 
working with the products (a;q)n ane:: (a ;q)"" is somewhat tedious. 
In order to verify q-product identities or to manipulate q-products, 
it may be helpful to write out the first three or four terms of each 
q-product. This should provide the needed insight in order to justify 
a gh-en step. After working with q-products for awhile, you will be-
gin to handle them more quickly and adroitly, and no longer need to 
write out any of their terms longhand. When you reach this stage, 
you should feel quite comfortable in I:l3nipulating q_series. It is as-

Introduction

in this first section, we introduce not3110n that wi!! be used through-
out the entire monograph. s.ewndly, we define the arithmetical func-
tions on which "'~ will focus for most of this book, and which can be 
studied by employing the theory of theW!. functions and q-series. A 
brief introduction to theta functions and q-series will be given in the 
next section, to be followoo in Section 1_3 by a few of th'" moot useful 
theorems about these functions

For example, P(4) = 5, because there are 5 ways to represent 4 as 
a 
sum of positive integers, namely, 4 = 3+ I = 2+2 = 2+ 1+1 = 1+1+ 
1 + 1. Readers should check that p(5) = 7 and p(6) = 11, but readers 
should not check (at least by hand) tha~ p(200) = 3, 972,999,029,388.

we multiply an even number of pOwers of q. and we obtain a minus

The q·binomial lhoorem is perha~ the mos~ widely used summa-

thoorem is a bilateral (i.e., the summalion index TUII.'i from - 00 to 00 
instead of from a finite integer to 00) analogue and is undoubtedly 
the most useful bilateral summation iJ q-series. In both (1.3.1) and 
(1.3.36) below, the series on the left sides hR,·e exactly One q-produet

For an introduction to the element&y t heory of partitions that is 
eminently accessible to undergraduates, read Integer P(lrtitlo7l$ [23J, 
by G. E. Andrews and K. Eriks!lon. The most authoritative account 
on the theory of partitions is also by Andrews [14], several portions 
of which are suitable for undergraduates. 
Hardy and Ramanujan [110J, [192, pp. 276-309) IICtually provoo 
more than (1.1.6); namely, they derived an infinite 8.Symptotic !le-

that their series did not converge, but it was IlQt until 1937 that 
D. H. Lehmer (140) shov.--.!d that it diverges_ In 1936, while prepar-
ing his lectures for a graduate course in analytic number theory at 
the UniveTl!ity of Pennsyh'B.nia, H. Rademacher [181], [182, pp. 108-
121] found an exact infinite series replesentation for p(n). At about 
the same time, A. Selberg [209, pp. 695-706], [52, pp. 203-213] also 
discovered this same exllCt formula. hut he never published his "'Ork. 
In their classic paper [110], [192, pp_ 276-3091, Hardy and Ra· 
ma.nujan introduced their famous Mcircle method," which remains to-
day as the primary tool of number theQrists using analytic techniques 
in studying problems in additive number theory. The principal idea

Theorem 1.3.1, the q-binomial theorem, is due to A. Cauchy 
[66, p. 45J, while Corollary 1.3.2 W!lS first proved by L. Euler ]91 , 
Chap. 16J. The Jacobi triple product identity was pro,'e(\ by C. G. J.

proof that ,,"e ha'"e gi'"en here is independently due to Andrews (12] 
and P. K. Menon [ISS]. F. Franklin devised a beautiful oombina_ 
torial proof of Corollary 1.3.5 (or Corollary 1.3.8). Sec Hardy and 
Wright's book ]112, pp. 286-287J or Andrews's text [14, pp. lO-
l l] for Franklin's proof. Jacobi's id~ntity, Theorem 1.3.9, has an 
elegant generalization found by S. BbargaVl\, C. Adiga. and D. O. 
Somashekara ]60]. 
Ramanujan·s ,1/1, summation theorem was first stated by Ra-
manujan in his notebooks 1193, Chap. 16, Entry 17J. In fact, he 
stated it in precisely the form gi'"en in Corollary 1.3.14. It was found 
by Hardy, who called it, ~a remarkable formula with many parame-
ters" and intimated that it could be established by employing the q-
binomial theorem [107, pp. 222- 223J. Hov.'(!,-er, it was not until 1949 
and 1950 that the first published proofs were giwn by W. Hahn (103] 
and M. Jackson [l30], respecth·ely. The proof that we ha'"e gi'"en 
here is due to K. Venkatachaliengar and was presented for the first 
time in the monograph by Adiga, Berndt, Bharga,.,., and G. N. Wat-
son [5]; see also Berndt's book ]34, pp. 32-34]. As with the other 
theorems in this chapter, there are ]lOW many proofs of the 11/1, the<;>-
rem. Almost all proofs employ the q_binomial theorem at some stage.

L. J_ Mordell (1631 and L. Carlitz and ),1. V. Suhbarao [63]. A partic-

Chapter 2 
Congruences for p( n) 
and T(n) 
2.1. Historical Background 
This chapter ill primarily devoted to prming some of Ramanujan'8 
oongruences for p(n) and T(n). We bep.n with II remark on notation. 
Throughout the chapter, ,,~shall see congruences of the sort 
(2.1.1) 
f (q) = g(q) (mod m), 
where f (q) = LD" q" and g(q) = l:h"q" are po ... ;er series in q. The 
coug,ueu"" (2.1.1 ) i", <:qui .. alent to t.he "",,,dition <In :::: b" (mod m ) for 
every integer n appearing as an index in either pm .. er series. 
In 1919, Ramanujan [188], (192, pp. 210-213) announced thM he 
had found three simple congruences sa.tlsfied by p{n), namely, 
(2.1.2) 
(2.1.3) 
(2.1.4) 
p(&n + 4) == 0 (modS), 
p(7n + 1'» = 0 (mod 7), 
p{lln + 6) == o (mod 11). 
He gave proofs of (2.1.2) and (2.1.3) in [188] and later in II short one 
page note [1901. [192, p. 230) announced that he had also found II 
IJlovf of (2.\.4). He ,,1/10 remark.. in [1001 that ~It appears thM. thl'," 
life no eqUILlly simple properties for an~ moduli involving primes other 
than these three. ~ In a poothumously published paper [191[, [192,

pp. 232- 238], Hardy extracted diffcren; proofs of (2. \.2)- {2.1.4) from 
an unpublished manuscript of Ramru.ujan 011 p{n) and 1"(n) [194, 
pp. 133-177], [50). 
In [188], Ramanujan offered II more general conjecture. Let.; = 
S°:r> II C and let >. be an integer such t.'Jat 24). ;;; I (mod 6). Then 
(2.1.:;) 
p(nO +,\,) ::;; 0 (mod 6). 
In his unpublished manuscript [194, liP. 133-I77J. ISO), Ramanujan 
gave II proof of (2.1.5) for a.rbitrary II and b = c = O. He also began 
II proof of his conjecture for arbitrary band 11 = C = 0, but he did 
not complete it. If he had completed his proof, he would have notioo::l 
that hi~ CQnjectur<: in this """" nudod UI b<l modified. Rarn,mujan had 
formulated his oonjoctures after studying II table ohalnes of p(n), O:; 
n < 200, made by P. MacMahon. After Ramanujan died, H. Gupta 
extended MacMahon's table up to n = 300. Upon examining Gupta'. 
table in 1934, S. Chowla (75] found that P(243) is not divilsibJe by 73, 
despite the fact that Z4 - 243 = I (mod 73). To correct Ramanujan·. 
conjectllN!, define 6' '" 5~7·'lIe, whue 1/ = 1>, if I> = 0,1,2, and 
II = ((I> + 2)/2), if I> > 2_ T hen

p(n6 +~) ;: O{mod 6'). 
I" 1938, G. N. WlI\.IIOn [218) published II proof of (2.1.6) for a = C = 0 
and gave a mQI"l detailed version of Ramanujan's proof Qf (2_1.6) in 
the case II _ C = O. It was not until 1%7 that A. O. L. Atkin 128] 
proved (2.1.6) for arbitrary c and a = ~ = O. 
The tau function r (n) was introduced by Ramanujao in his fa-
mous paper (186), (192, pp. 136-162). 
Although he proved little 
about r(n) in this paper, he did Formulate some fundamental conjec-
tures about r (n). 10 (190), RamanujaD stated ,,';thout proof congru-
ences for r(n) modulo 5, 7, and 23. In his unpublished manuscript on 
p(n) and r (n) (194, pp. 133- 177], (50]. he proved these congruences 
and several Further results on r(n).

divide the terms into residue classes modulo S. If n _ 0, 2 (modS), 
then the pov.-enl are integral, and these. when d;"ided by (,f; ,f)oo, 
account for the terms in J,{q). If n ;: 3,4 (modS), then the powers

2.4. Ramanujan's Congruence 
p(7n + 5) _ 0 (mod 7) 
We consider next Ramanujan's congruence for p(n) modulo 7. 
Theorem 2.4.1. For fW.ch nonnegalitte inlegl!T n,

p(7n + 5) E 0 (mod 7). 
pn....,r. Our pr ...... r i~ "-&,,iu tahu [wm Ra",,,"ujall'~ pa!",r 11881 1111u 
was sketched by Hardy 1107, p. 88J. 
First, by the binomial theorem, 
q2(q7 ;q7)", f: p(n)q" = q2 (q7; q7 )", = q2(q; q)!, (q7; q7~"" 
.. ~n 
{q;q)"" 
(q;q)"" 
(2.4.2) 
E q'(q; q)!, (mod 7). 
Hence, if we can show that the coeffici~nt of q7n+7, n > 0, in q2(q; q )~ 
is a multiple of 7, it will follow from (2.4.2) that the coefficient of q7"+7 
on the far left side is a multiple of 7, i,e., p(7n + 5) = 0 (mod 7). 
Applying Jawbi's identity, Theorem 1.3.9, we find that 
q2(q; q)~ = q2 {(q; q)!.,}2 
(2.4.3) 
As we saw in the previous parllgraph, we want to know when the 
exponents abo>." are multiples of 7 Now o~r\'e that 
(2j + 1)2 + (2k + If = 8{2 + !JU + 1)+ !k(k+ In - 14, 
and so 2 + !iU + I) + !k(k + I) is a multiple of 7 if and only if 
(2.4.4) 
(2j + 1)2 + (2k + 1)2 _ 0 (mod 7). 
We easily see that (2j + If, (2k + 1)2 := 0, I, 2, 4 (mod 7), and so the 
only way (HA ) can hold is if both (2j + If, (2k + If - O(mod 7). 
In such cases, we trivit8'p~_fg}U~li~IDcients on the tight side of 

B. C. BERNDT 
(2.4.3) art:' multiples of 7. Hence, the cocffi~ient of q7n+T,n ~ I, QIl 
the left side of (2.4.3) is a multiple of 7. As we demonstrated in t~ 
foregoing pal"agraph, this implies that p{7n + :J) ;;; 0 (mod 7).

We now consider the lUIalogue of Thoorem 2.3.4 for p{7n + 5), 
which was staled without proof by Ramanujan in his paper [188). 
In his unpublished manuscript on p{n) and T(n), he gh"eli a '"Cry 
brief sketch of its proof [194, pp. 133- I77J, [50J. Then! are now 
several proofs of Theorem 2.4.2, but t~ detaiJ..; of RamlUlujan's proof 
wen! worked out Oldy recently by Berndt, A. J. Vee, and J. Yi [54). 
Because the details are cumbersome. we provide only theoentral ideas 
and refer n!aders to [54J for a complete proof. Readers should not 
attempt to oompleu: missing details but merely try to gra.sp the idcillS 
behind Rarnanujan's proof.

2.6. Notes 
Theorem 2.2.1 has been slightly refined by /11. R.Murty, V. K. Mutt)'. 
and T. N. Shorey (165), using a. more sophisticated lLTgllIDeot. They 
also obtain lll"'-et" bounds for the values of T{n) "'hen T(n) is odd. 
Another proof of Theorem 2.3.1 , rivalling Ramanujan's first proof 
in simplicity, has been given hy J. Drost 184]. See l\I. D. Hirschhorn's 
paper [120] for still another elementary proof. Many refereneal to fur-
ther proofs of both T~Jfgmi}J MJ~;r~rem 2.3-4 can be found 

B.C. BERNDT 
in the latest edition of Ramanujan's C,,/Jedd Paper$ 1192. pp. 372-
375]. These pages also oontaln references t.o o~her proofs of Thoorelllll 
2.4.1 and 2.4.2. Ramanujan himself summari:red the congruenoes he 
proved and the methods he uWized to prove them in a letter to Hardy 
written from the nursing borne, Fitzroy liouse, in the summer of 1918. 
In partio;ular, he wrote (1)1, pp. 192- 193], "Thus the divisibility by 
5"7611< when ... ., 0,1,2,3, b = 0, I, 2,3: c = 0,1 , 2 amounting 1.0 
4 x 4 x 3 - I Or 47 cases of the conjectured theorem are prm1!<l." 
This statement is interesting for several reasall.'l. First, fuunanujan 
had e"idenlly prm"ed special cases of his general oonjedure withom 
leaving us proofs in these cases. Second, he claimed a proof fOf" the 
modulus 73, but we had noted in the introduction to this chapter 
that RamanUjan'8 conjecture was false in this case. Third, Ramanu-
jan's proof of his conjecture for arbitrary powers of 5 was obviou5ly 
estahlished after tbis letter was written. 
We haw not given a proof of Ramanujan's congruence 
p(llfl+6) - 0 (1l1od II). The most elementary proof is due to L. Win-
quist (2271 and uses Winquilt '$ ld~lIil!l . Further proofs ofWinquist'$ 
identity ha"e been found by Hirscllhorn [117) and S.- Y. Kang [133). 
Another elementary approach 10 proving that p(lln+6) = O(rnod II) 
has been devised by Bemdt, S. U. Chan, Z.-G. Liu, and H. Yesilyurt 
[481. who established a new identity for (q, q);'::. Hirschhorn [118) hu 
devised a COmmon approach to pro"ing all three congruen<.:ei (2.1.2)-
(2.1.4). 
Hirschhorn and O. C. Hunt [126] ga,,>'! an alternatiw proof al~ 
classical lines to thM of Ramanujan and Watson for Ramanujan's 
oongruence modulo 5". Those readers intrigued by our sketch of Ra-
manujan's Theorem 2.4.2 might consult F. G. Gan-an's [95] proof of 
the more general congruence modulo 76 
Rarnanujan appeared to conjecture that t he only congruences of

SupJ>Q:Se, h<m~ver, that Wi! drop the restriction that the moduli 
of the arithmetic progressions are the same as the moduli of the con· 
gruences. That is, are there congruences when the moduli are not 
the same or are n()t primes? The first theorems establishing lots of 
congruences for p{n) were found by Atkin [291. Then K. On() 1175J 
proved that, given any prime t ;:: 5, there exist infinitely many con· 
gruences ()f the type p{An + 8) '" 0 (mod t). T his was extended by 
Ahlgren [7J wh() established a similar re!u1t for any prime pow!.'T r. A 
consequence af their work is that if t ;:: 5 is prime, then for 1\ posith~ 
proparLion of positi,-e integers n, p{n) == 0 (mod t). Nonetheless, lind· 
ing roncrete examples iUustrating their theorems is not easy. Atkin 
and J. N. O'Brien \30J had earlier found II couple of such congruences; 
one is 
p(17303n + 237) = 0 (mud 13).

over 76,000 explicit examples, all with t ~ 3\.

best lower bounds for the number of even and odd wslues of p{n) in

In his unpubLisbed manuscript on p(1l) and T(Il), Ramanujan as-
serted and, in some cases, pro>-ed further congruences for T(n), rnOf<l 
involving divisor functions. References to most of the many papers 
written on this subject can be found in Berndt and Ono'5 acrount of 
Ralnanujan's manuscript 150]. We now have a complete understand_ 
ing of congruences for T(n) through the theory of i-arlic represent.a._ 
tions, and an account of this with many references can be found in 
H. P. F. Swinnerton-Dyer·s sun·ey paper [213]. There are, in essence, 
only six congruences for T(n), with the largest modulus being 691. 
Z.-H. Sun and K. S. Williams [212] hal'e eS\.ablished a refinement 
of Theorem 2.2.4. To describe their theorem. we first need to deliill' 
the order of an integer. Let p denote a prime. Then the uniqllt 
nonncgatiw integer (> such that p"ln but p<>+l j n is called tbe order 
of n modulo p and is denoted by ordpn.

As mentioned in the Historical & ckground beginning this chap-

[192, pp. 136-16], which was to become one of the most impo"ant 
papers in tbe history of number theory. In this paper, Ramannjan 
made three important conjectures about T(n). 
(a) T(n) is multil)licative, i.e., T(m)T(n) = T{mn), wbelle\"," 
(m. n)= 1.

3.8. Notes 
The formulas for r2(n), r4(n), r6(n), and rs(n) gi\= in Theorems 
3.2.1,3.3.1,3.4.1 , and 3.5.4, respectively, are due to Jacobi [131]. 
All four theorems can be proved arithmetically. For example, see 
Hardy and Wright's book [112, pp. 241- 242] for an elementary proof 
of Th"" .... m 3 2.1. In f::h"pt.er 6. we return to these problems and ii'"C 
completely difJerent proof$ of Jacobi's formula!; for r4(1I) and ra(n) 
arising out of RamanujlUl's theory of elliptic functiollll. 
T he first proof of Theorem 3.2.1 that .... e have given is due to 
M. D. Hirschhorn [l 15J. In a later paper [119], he gave another sim-
ple proof b&$ed on Jacobi's identity, Theorem 1.3.9. One year later, 
Hirschhorn (122J showed that one can derive further theorems about 
r~ ( n) from T heorem 3.2.1. The first proof of Theorem 3.3.1 that ""C 
have gi'"Cn is also due to Hirschhorn (116J, who earlier [114J had given 
another proof. S. Bhargava and C. Adiga {58J have also utilized the 
,1/J, summation formula to give simple proofs of Theorems 3.2.1 and 
:S.:S. L. Starting with Tb.,..,,,,w 3.2.1 fOJ tWO 3qu",~, B. K. Spc<U"man 
and K. S. Williams [210] provided an elementary arithmetic proof of 
Theorem 3.3.1 for four squares. For a proof of Theorem 3.3. 1 based 
on a I"CCurrence and compuU!r algebra, see a paper by G. E. Andrews, 
S. 8 . Ekhad, and D. ~~§WlJa~haIJ»~proof of T heorem 3.4.1 is

16(n) = i L (_l)(d+l){1d~.

We are uncertain who first prO\w (3.& I), but an equivalent formula-
tion can be found in an unpublished manuscript of Ramanujan [194. 
p. 3::.6], j19, pp. 398-40IJ. T he first published proof known to us is by 
K. 000, S. RobiJl.'i, and P. T. Wahl (177, Thoorem 4]; this proof uses 
the thoory of modular forms. An arithmetic proof is gh~n in j128, 
p. 262, Theorem 11[. S. Cooper and H. Y. Lam (801 al'lO employed 
t he ]w] summation formula to prove Theorem 3.4.1. The proof of 
Theorem 3.5.4 that we have given is due to J.- F. Lin 1144J, who in 
another pllp<!r !145] gave II variant of his proof. As we have seen, 
Lin's primary idea in [144J is based on squaring II particular Lam-
bert series. This is the same idea ~ 
by Ramanujan in his proof 
of the fundamental identity (4.2.6) for Eisenstein series in Chapter 4. 
This idea w a:; also employed and generali~ by K. Venkatacltalien· 
gar [214, p_ 37) and elaborated upou iu mote detail by Cooper 176,

A. M. Legendre (139, p. 133) was the first to prove (3.8.3). An ana-
lytic equi,.,uent of (3.8.3) can be found in Ramanujan's lost notebook 
11941, (19, p. 401). Ono, Robill.'J, and WahL (177, p. 82) ha,·e estab-
lished (3.8.3) using the tlleory of modular fOrIllll. An arithmetic proof 
of (3.8.3) can be found in [128]. We prO\-ide a proof of (3.8.3) in 
Chapter 6; see Theorem 6.2.12. 
The connection bet"'«!n fOTllmLas for sums of squares and sums 
of triangular numbers was further solidified by P. Barruca.nd, Cooper. 
and Hirschhorn [32] .... ho pro,-ed that 
rl (8n+k) = clfk(n), 
... here 
Cl = z"(l + ~(:))' l<k<1. 
Thus, the study of Ik(n ), for 1 S" k S" 1, is reduced to the study of 
the subsequence rl (8n + k) of rk (n). 
Another elegant approach was gi>'en by L. Carlitz (62J. lie em-

mulation of (3.8.4) can be found in N. J. Fine's book (94, p. 22, 
eq. (18.85)]. Bailey'S proof 131) of (3.8.4) employs the Weierstrass 
p-function from the theory of elliptic functio!l!l. Shortly thereafter. 
J. M. Dobbie 183) gave a shorter, more elemenlary proof of (3.8.4). 
Williams gave an arithmetic proof of Theorem 3.::'.4 based on an 
extension of an identity of J. Liouville [225).

Andre,,'S (13) used the theory of basic bypergoomelric serie5 to

k < 4. 
Formulas for rk(n), when k is odd, haw an entirely different

concrete form by G. EiS('nstein (88), 190, p. 505J. who also glI'1! aLI

Theorem 3.6.2 is due to Jacobi. '!'be first proof of Theorem 3.6.3 
was found by Legendre [139, p. 133). Further proofs "'ere giwm by 
Cl'uchy [65, p. 572J. [66, p. 64) and Plana [179. p. 147J. For an 
elementary proof based on an extens;Cln of I'n identity of Liouvi\k>, 
see a paper by J. G. Huard, Z. M. Ou, B. K. Spearman, a.nd Williams 
[128). Jacobi [131J claimed that V. Y. Bouniakowsky first proved 
Theorem 3.6.3, but he did not give a reference. Lin [143[ derived 
a formula for the number of rep ........ nt~tio"" of " pooitj'"e intcg<:r by 
8 triangular numbers. The analogue of Lagrange's theorem is the 
theorem of Gauss [98, p. 497) stating that every p<:>Sitive integer can 
be represented as a sum of three triangular numbers. An elegant 
proof via q·series has been given by Andre",!! (16). Williams [226) 
derived an elegant formula for the number of representatioIL'! of a 
pnsiti''e integer as a Sum of two triangular numbers plus twice the 
sum of two triangular numhcrs. Liouville (146), [147) determined the 
p<:>$itive integers n, b, and c, \ < a :$ b :S c, such that the polynomial 
Oll. l + 1>00.2 + cil,J, where ll.l, il,2, and ll.3 denote triangular numbers,

For an exposition of Liouville's methods giving formulas for ru(n). 
1'5 k < 5, see Chapter 14 in M. B. Nathanson's text (167). 
Although not explicitly stated by him, Theorom 3.7.5 is due to 
P. G. L. Dirichlet [82). The first explicit statement of Theorem 3.7.5, 
Ilowever, ill due to L. wrenz in 1871 [152]. The proof of Theorem 
3.7.5 that we have given was independent.ly given by &rodl [35} 
and by Shargava, Adiga, and. D. D. Somashekara [59). R. A. Askey 
(27) used Ramanujan'$ I ~ summation theorem to derh~ a formula 
for the oumber of ways a positive integer can be represeoted by a 
square and twice a square. Although not stated explicitly by him, 
Theorem 3.7.11 is also due to Dirichlet (8 2], who proved a general 
theorem for representations of integers by binary quadratic forll15. 
Thus, every theorem in this chapter concerning representations of 
integers as sums of squares is, in fact, contained in Dirichlet'. general 
theorem. Theorom 3.7.4 has been enormously generalized by Williarru; 
(224], who derived a representation for certain sums of the products 
<p(q")<P(tf) in terms of Lambert serie:<;. The analytic formulation of 
Theorem 3.7.11, that is, Theorem 3.7.10, ClUl be found in a letter from 
Ramanujan to Hardy "Titten on a Saturday, probably in H1l8, from 
the nursing home, Fitzroy House [194, pp. 93-96). (51, pp. 196--198). 
This letter is examined in detail in Berndt's paper (35), and indeed 
our proof of Theorem 3.7.10 has been taken from (35]. Hirschhorn 
(121) has used a general method involving partial fractions to give 
uniform proofs of Theorems 3.2.1, 3.3.1, and 3.7.5. 
Equality (3.2.8), equality (3.3.12), Theorem 3.7.2, and l'heo:tem 
3.1.4 are gh'en by Ramanuj3l1 in Entry 8(i)-{iv), respectively, in 
Chapter 11 of his second notebook [193], [34 , p. 114}. Theorems 3.5.3, 
3.6.2, and 3.6.3, or equivalent formulations, are given by Ramanujan 
as ~a.mples in Section 11 of Chspter 11 in h.ils ..ecood notebook [193}, 
[34, p. 139). 
We h!we concentrated Our remarks on r1~ (n), for Ie ~ 4. MO/lt

Eisenstein series were first introduced and studied extensively by 
G. Eisenstein {ST]. {S9, pp. 357--478] in 1847_ In contemporary 1>0-

firnt equality in (4_5.1) does not hold if j _ 1, although the series on 
the right side converges fnr j = I. We have defined Eiselllltein &«ries 
by the latter two repretientMions in (4_5_1)_ These u n be e<tablished 
from tbeformer representations by using the LipsclritZ$ummation fw-

T. M_ A])/>I!tQl's text ]2:>, 
pp. 18-20, 24J or B. Schoeneberg's book !20:>, pp. 51-03J. The Eigen-
stein ~ 
~j (T ) is a modular fonn of weight 2j on the full mod-
ular group. Along with the discriminant function 6 (T) := q(O;O): . 
q = .,h;~ , thEse functions form the building blocks for all analytic 
modular forms on the full modular group. For basic properties of 
Eil;enBtein series from the point of view of modular forms, see, for ex-
ample, the aforementioned texts w; well w; R. A. RAnkin's text [196, 
Chap. 6]. 
Ramanujall made many original and fundamental oontributions 
to the theory of Eisenstein oories, mOf;t notably in his lo!it notebook 
and letter!! to Hardy 11941_ In particuh,,·, in letteno he ",rote to Hardy 
from nursing homes near the end of his OOjollfO in England, he derh-ed 
formul88 for the ooefficient~ of oertain Quotients of Ei'lffll.tein series. 

H" 
B.C. BERNDT 
These formulas are an8.logous t.o the lI.'iymptotic formula for p(n) of 
Hardy and Ramanujan that was discllved in (1.1.6) and the IIOtes 
for Chapter 1. Howe>-er, their forms and proofs are much different. 
For accounts of this work, ~ 
papers of Hardy and Ramanujllll (I l l ), 
[192, pp. 3W-321J, Berndt and P. Bialek [42], and Berndt, Bialek, 
and A. J. Vee [431. For an account of aU of Ramanujan'B theorems OIl 
Eisenstein series from his lost notebook, other unpublished papers, 
and letters, see the book [20J by G. E. Andrews and Berndl. For an 
expository survey of many of Ramanujan's theorems on Eisenstein 
ser;!)5 from his lost notebook, see the paper [53] by Berndt and Vee. 
In his notebooks (193), Ramanujan made further claims about 
Eisenstein series. In particular, in Entry 14 of ChapleT 15 of his 8eC-
ond notebook, Ramanujan recorded another recurrence relation for 
Eisenstein series; see Berndt's book [33, p . 332). Also, Cbapters 17 
and 21 in Ramanujan's second notebook contain many claims about 
Eisenstein series. See Berndt's book [34] for proofs of all these theor 
rems. 
An important function which "'e ha\'e not discussed in this book 
is the modular j·invariant defined by

The values of j(T) and its Fourier or po",er series coefficients are of 
great importance in the theory of modular ro~. 
At about the same time that Ramanujan discm'ered the differell-
tial equation (4.2.20) satisfied by P(q), in 1911, J. Chazy [74] c0n-
sidered the third order differential equation

When (> = 1< and {3 = 1</ 2, (5. 1.10) reduces to Theorem &.1.6. We 
highly recommend that readers provide a rigorous proof of (&.1.10). 
Examining closely the definition of ~Fl (!,!; 1; x) as x ~ I, ~ 
conjecture that a partilll sum of 2Fl (!, ~; I; ,,) behaves like a partial 
Sum of the harmonic series. We mllke this observa.tion more precme 
in the following lemma, which is used In the next section.

_ Ilia paper with Y. L. Ong (71]. The Principles of Duplication and 
Dimidia~ion are due 1.0 Jacobi [1311. Ramanujan states the Principlp 
of Duplication in Entry 13(vii) of Chapter 17 in his second notebook 
[1931. [34, p. 127]. It is dear that Ramanujan frequently used the 
Principles of Duplication and Dimidiation in his work on elliptic func· 
tions. Our presentation of these principles is similar 1.0 that given in 
the author's book [34, pp. 125-126]. 
Por Ramanujan, it was natural t.O ask whether there "'ere other 
theories of elliptic fWlctions in wbich the hypergeometric fnnc~ion 
?F, (~, i; 1; x) is T(>placed by other hypergeometric fnnctions. In his 
famous paper, Modular equatwns on~ approximations to 1r [184),

The fonnula (5.1.6) is due 1.0 the Scottish mathematician C. 
Maclaurin [153] in 1742. Our proof of Landen's transformation, 
Theorem 5.1.6, is almost identical to the proof that the English as-
tronomer J . lvory [129) ga\'e in 1796 for (5. 1.6). When h'Ory aubmit·

rectification of the ellipsis occurred to me, remarkable for its simplic-
ity, as well as its rapid convergency. As I believe it to be new, I send 
it to you .... " 
Landen's transformation was introduced by J. Landen in a pa_ 
per written in 1771 {U T] but developed more completely in his pa-
per 113S] published in 1775. This transformation was crucial in OUT 
proof of the fundamental Thoorem 5.2.8. The importance of Lan· 
den's transformation is conveyed by G. MittaJ:-Leffier, who. in his 
survey article (160J on elliptic li.mctions written in 1923, emphasizes, 
"Euler's addition theorem and the traz:sformation theor~m of Landen 
and Lagrange were the two fundamental idellS of which the tbeory of 
elliptic functions was in possession when this theory WlIs brough~ up 
for renewed consideration by Legendre in 1786.~ 
Born in 1719, Landen WlIs appointtd as the land·agent to the Earl 
Fitzwilliam, a post he held until his retiremeut t"""O yean! before his 
death in 1790. According to an edition of Encyclopedia Britanniw 
published in 1882, ~H e [LandenJ lived a '~ry retired life, and saw little 
or nothing of sociely; when he did mingle in il, his dogmatism and 
pugnacity caused him to be generally sllunned. ~ Landen made several 
contributions to the Ladie5 Dillry, which Wlls published in England 
from 1704 to 1816 and "designed principally for the amusement and 
instruction of tbe fair sex.n As WlIs COmmOn with other contributors, 
Landen frequently used pseudonyms, !uch as Sir Stately Stiff, Peter 
Walton, Waltoniensis, C. Bumpkin, and Peter Puzzl~m , for prob-
lems he proposed and .'IOh"ed. The largest portion of each issue ,,"as 
de'"Oted to the presentation of mathematical problems and their s0-
lutions. Despite its name, of the 913 contributors of mathematical 
problems and solutions Over the years of its publication, only 32 were

Exercise 5.1.9 is just one of many beautiful transformation fOT_

Landen's transformation for inoomple>e elliptic integrals is only one 
example of many beautiful relations that exist between elliptic inte-
grals. many of which are due to Jacobi (131] and Ramanujan [193. 
Chapter 17, 5e<:tion 8], (34. pp. 1M- 113). T he text [180, Cbapters 2-
4) by V. Prasolov and Y. Solovyev is a superb introduction to elliptic 
integrals describing the fundamental ,heorems of Legendre. Jacobi, 
ann N. H. AI,.,!. 
Lemma 5.1.10 is a primitive, special case of a much more general 
asymptotic formula for Gaussian hypergeometric series; for example, 
see [33, pp. 77-18]. 
The catalogue of formulas for theta functions given in 5e<:tion 5.4 
is taken from Sections 10-12 of Chapter 11 in Ramanujan's second 
notebook [1931. [33, pp. 122- 124J. T he formulas for Q(q) and R(q) in 
Theorems 5.4.1 1 and 5.4.12 can be fou1d in Section 13 of Chapter 11 
in Ramanujan's second notebook (1931. [34, pp. 126- 121]. Although 
the formulas for P(q) in Theorem 5.4.9 are not found in Section 13, 
from the appearances of other formulas for P(q) in that section, it 
is clear that Ramanujan knew Theorem 5.4.9. Ramanujan used his 
formulas for P(q), Q(q) , and R(q) to derive a multitude of elegant 
evaluations of infinite series in 5e<:tions 13-11 of Chapter 17 [34, 
pp. 126-139]. For example,

We are grateful to K. S. Williams for providing tbe second proof of 
T heorem 6.2.4, the proof of Theorem 6.2.9, and Exercise 6.2.7. 
The theory of modular equations begins with Legendre's (139, 
vol. 1, p. 229j modular equation of degree 3 in 1825. namely, 
(6.4.1 ) 
(ap)I/4 + {(l- o l( I - (J )}1/4 = I. 
In the century that followed, several mathematicians, including A. 
Berry, A, Cayley, A. Enneper, E. Fiedler, R. Ft-icke, C. Guet'l'laff, 
M. Hanna, C. G. J. Jacobi, F. Klein. R. Russell, L. Schliifli, H. 
Schwter, L. A. Sohru:ke, G. N. Watson, and H. Weber, contributed 
to the growing list of modular equatiQn5. Ihw:e.-er, the mathemati-
cian whQ diso;wered far mQre modular equations than any Qf thew 
mathematicians was Ramanujan. whQ constructed over 200 modular 
equations. 
As indicated immediately above, the fonn of the modular eqll&-

respecth"ely, ""ere first discovered by Legendre (139, \-01. 1, p. 223J and 
rediscovered by Jacobi (13 1, p. 25J. A. we have seen, the parameter-
izations of a and fJ in terms of the multiplier m are extremely useful 
in deriving modular equations of degree 3. Similar parameterizations 
exi.'lt for a and ,8 in the theory of modular equations of degree 5 (34, 
pp. 280-2881. but for higher degrees we do not know of any further 
parameterizations, which reHcct.s t he fact that witb increasing n, the 
shapes of modular equations become iucreasingly more oomplex, and 
finding them becomes increasingly mOTe difficult. 
The paper [105J by M. Hanna provides a summary of much of 
the "-ork w;wmplished on modular equations up until 1928. 
Ramanujan summarized much of his work on modular equations

Readers will immediately ask, "Why does q l/~ appear in the defi. 
nition of R(q)!" The reason is that R(q) belon.g:s to the wOlrld of theta 
functiOl08, and R(q)'s modular properties are lOore symmetric and el· 
egant with q l/~ appearing in its definition than if ql/$ were absent. 
However, there are oe<:asi008 when the factor ql/5 is nOlt helpful, and 
SO we then use ooe of the representations (7.1 .7) Olr (7.1.8). 
1.2. The Converge nce, Divergence, and Values 
of R(q) 
In the definitiOln above, we ha''e nOlt indicated where R(q) com'erges 
or where it diverges. By standard thoorems (151, pp. 35, 94J, R(q) 
comoerges in the complex q--plane fOlr jq( < I , and it di''erges for 
(q( > 1. What happens if 1111 = I? Taking the redprocals of {7.1.4} 
and (7.1.fl), "oe find, respe<:thoely, that

_ R(-I) '" .J5
2+ 1, 
where we have taken the root (_ I j1/~ '" - 1 in the definitiOln of R(q). 
FUrthermOlre, I. Schur [207, pp. 319-321), (208, pp. 117- 136) and 
Ramanujan in his notebooks (1931 established the fOlliowing theorem 
(38, p_ 35). 
Theorem 7.2.1. Recall that T (q) i3 deji'led by (7.1.8). Let q be a 
primitive mth root of unity. If m is !I multiple of fl. T (q) divergu. 
Otherwise, T (q) converges and

whe"" 0 denote! the Legend"" symbol ('W-) and p i& /he leMt p<lsinw 
residt>e 0/ m modulo a. 
Thus, for a root of unity, we know when R(q) com'erges and when 
it diverges. What about other points on Iql '" I? We do not know 
the answer in general, but D. Bowman and J. McLaughlin (61) have 
found an uncountable set of measure 0 on the unit circle (not includ· 
ing anth roots of unity) where R(q) di''erges. It is conjectured that 
R(q) diverges on the unit circle except for those points of convergence 
described in Theorem 7.2.l. 
All mentioned above, the RogeIll- Ranumujan continued fraction 
Wa!l fiIllt defined by Rogers, who proved a few of itll properties. How· 
e''er, most of the results that ""'e know about this continued fraction 
are due to RAmanujan. $everal theorems about R(q) appear in his 
notebooks [193), but his lost notebook [194) contains considerably 
more material On R(q); see 119, Chapters 1- 5). In his first t,,"<) letten 
to G. H. Hardy [192, PI'. xxvii, xxvii( , [51 , pp. 29, 57), RAmanujan 
communicated !;<l\'eral theorems on R(q). In particular. in his first 
letter [192, p. xxvii), (51 , p. 29J. Ramanujan ga,'e the first noIlO'ie-
melltary evaluations of R(q), namely. 
(7.2.3) 
R(e-2-) = J5 +2.;g _ ..;52+ 1 
.w 
(7.2.4) 
where we ha''e set 
(7.2.5) 
S(q) = - R(-q). 
In his second letter to Hardy [192, p. :o:viii), [51. p. a7]. Rrunanujan 
further asserted that 
R (~-2_.;5) = 
..;5 
I+V53/4(~)~/2 _ 1

In both letters, RAmanujan claimed that [192, p. xxvii), [51 . pp. 29,

The meaning of this last statement "'as not clarified until 1996 ",hen 
Berndt, H. H. Chan, and L.--C. Zhang [46\ demonstrated that if n is 
a positive integer and if the requisite c!ass invariants could be deter-
mined, then R( e - ~"r.;:) could be explicitly evaluated. (Class in,-aciants 
~ 
certain multiple!! of Ramanujan's functioo X( ±~- · ';;;:) . Histori-
cally, they wer~ first brought into prominence by H. Weber [ZZOj, who 
explicitly calculated many class invariants and who used them to gen-
erate Hilbert class fields. Ramanujan explicitly determined over 100 
class invariants and used them to calculate ,-alues of certain quotients 
oflheta funct-lons and t he Rogers-Ramanujan continued fraction. Ra-
manujan's work on cla.ss in'"3riants is described in [38, Chapter 34]. 
For ao introductioo to class invariants and Ramanujan's applications 
oftbem, see [47].) Both in his notebooks [193] and his lost notebook 
[194], Ramanujan recorded many values for Lhe Rogers- Rama.nujan 
oontinued fraction. For example, On pages 204 and 210 of hill lost 
notebook [194], Ramanujan offered the \'lI.lue 
where S(q) ;5 defined by (7.2.5). For proofs of the5e clainu;, see 144J, 
[46J, and [19, Chapter 21. Those readers with some background in 
aI(.~l"aic nwnber th~ry and who h"w: been exccptio""lIy oOOerV3nt 
will have observed that each of the \'3lu~ for R(q) that we have quoted 
is a unit in some algebraic number field. T his is true for all \'lI.lues of 
R(e-·.,{ii), when n is a positive inleger; see [46] for 1\ proof. 
We record one further result on R(q) communicated from India 
by Ramanujan to Hardy. Let 0" and {J be pooitive numbers such that 
u{J = ",1. In his second letter to Hardy, Ramanujan 119Z, p. xxviii], 
151, p. 57] claimed that 
(7.2.6) (I 
+2.;s + R (~-2"») (I 
+2.;s + R(e- 2t1)) = 5 +z .;s, 
which was first proved in print by Watson IZI6). T his result is also 
recorded as Entry 39(i) in Chapter 16 of Ramanujan's second note-
book; see [34, pp. 84-851 for another proof and furt·her reference!:l, 
and also see !19, p. 9'\!:ofjp~hMa WlriID0WS the value of R(e- 10 )

The Rogef$-Rrun/Uluj&ll oontinued fraction was one of RamanujlUl'l 
fa>-orit.e functions. We have related to readers IIOme of it.s IJlOfit fa&-
cinating properties. but Ramanujan recorded many further re!!ult.ll, 
esp«ially in his lost IlOtebook [194]. We hope readCi'll will be stimu· 
lated to read about these discoveries in Chapters i- 6 of (19), which is 
the most complete souroe of theorems and referencea on the Rage ...... 
Ramanujan continued fraction. An eqM)OIltory aca>l.u,t vf "",,,,,,a1I~ 
orems on the Rogers-Ramanujan CQntinued fraction ean be found in 
[45J. A !ubset of the TeIlulta proved in [19) are established in [49]. 
Hardy WlIS intrigued by Ramanujan's claims about thc Rogers-
Ramanuj&ll oontinuecC~I!~"NIU6nly wrote to RBmanujan 

'" 
B. C. BERNDT 
urging him to write a pa~r about it. In a letter probably written On 
24 December 1913. Hardy exhorted {51, p. 871 
)fyou will send me your proof written out carefully 
(so that it is easy to follow), I will (assuming that 
I agree ,,~th it-of which [ have very liule doubt) 
try to get it published for YOll in England. Write it 
in the form of a paper "On lac continued fraction 
"

giving a full proof of the principal and most re-
m"rkAhl~ th...,r"m. viz. that the fraction can be 
expr med in finite terms ",he., :J: = e- w';;;, when.!! 
is rationaL 
However, Ramanujan ncver followed Hardy 's advice. 
The history of the famolls Rogers-Ramanujan identities (7.3.10) 
is now well known. They werc originally disoo'1'red by Rogers [198J 
and rediscovered by Ramanlljan, who at first did nOt have proofs of 
them. One day while at Cambridge, Rarnanujan was perusing back is-
sues of the Pr0cee4ing$ of the Lo"da" Mathematical Society and found 
Rogers's paper [198) giving pr()Ofs of (i.3.10). Ramanujan soon fOWid 
his own pr()Ofs and published them in [189), [192, pp. 214- 215J. Far 
further historical accounts, see Hardy's book [107, pp. 00-99). An-
dre .... s·s text [14. Chapter 7). or Berndt's book [34. pp. 77- 79). Many 
proofs of the identiti~ nOw exist; a description and classificat-ion of 
all known proofs up to 1989 can be found in Andrews's paper 117). 
The identities (7.3.10) ha\l~ beautiful combinatorial interp~ta­
tions. In the definition of G(q) given in (7.3.1), write ,,1 = 1 + 3 + 
... + (2n - l ). The 6rst identity in (7.3.10) is equh-alent to the asser-
tion that the number of partitions of a positive integer N jnto distinct 
partS with differences at least 2 equals the number of partitions of N 
into pacUi congruent to either 1 or 4 modulo 5. For example, there ar~ 
6"e partitions of 9 into distin<;t pacl..>! with differences bet .... een parI..>! 
at least 2. namely, 9, 8+ I , 7 +2.6+3, and &+3+ I. The 6, ... partitiom; 
of 9 into parts congruent to either 1 or 4 modulo & are 9, 6+ I + I + I. 
HH I, 4 + 1 + I + I + tthyil3~'~~ Mater;~" For the second identit)', 

SPIRlT OF RAMANUJAN 
'" 
in the definition of H(q), write n(n + 1) = 2+4 + .. ·+2n. The second 
Rogers- Ramallujan identity in (7.3.10) i~ an analytic statement of the 
f1lCl. that t he number of partitions of N into distinct parts with differ-
ences at least 2 and with no I's is equal to the number of partitions 
of N into parts congruent to either 2 or 3 modulo 5. For example, the 
three partitions of 8 into distinct parts with parts differing by at least 
2 and with no 1'8 are 8, 6 + 2, and 5 + 3, while the three partitioDll 
of 8 into parts congruent to either 2 Of 3 modulo 5 are 8, 3 + 3 + 2, 
8nd2+2+2+2. 
Exercise 7.6.1. Pro~ that I~ Roger3- Rumanujan idrntitiu have 
the combinatorial interpretation.! de.IJcriW in !he p~in9 pamgraph. 
Theorem 7.4.2 is due to Hirschhorn [1231, and the proofs of The-
orems 7.4. \ and 7.4.2 that we ha''e gh·en are also due to Hirschhorn 
[123]. The only other proof of Theorem 7.4.1 known to us is by Wat.-
son [215J, who employed the quintuple product identity. Hirschhorn's 
proof is !lQmewhat simpler. The proof of Theorem 7.4.\ given by 
Berndt [34, p. 267J is similar to that of Watson. Qill deduction of 
Theorem 7.4.4 from Theorem 7.4.1 is the same as that given in the 
aforementioned works of Watson, Bendt, and Hirschhorn. 
Exercise 7.4.6 arose from the oombined efforts of Hirschhorn, 
P. Crut<:her, O. Yest Chan, and thc .. ·.lthor. 
An approach to the Rogers-Ramanujan continued fraction via 
modular fomlS has beo:!n written by W. Duke [85].
