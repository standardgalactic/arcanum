ABSTRACT 
 
 
 
 
The study of parts and wholes, or mereology, occupies two of the best 
philosophical minds of twelfth-century Europe, Abelard and Pseudo-Joscelin.   
But the contributions of Abelard and Pseudo-Joscelin cannot be adequately 
assessed until we come to terms with the mereological doctrines of the sixth century 
philosopher Boethius.  Apart from providing the general mereological background for the 
period, Boethius influences Abelard and Pseudo-Joscelin in two crucial respects.  First, 
Boethius all but omits mention of the classical Aristotelian concept of form.  Second, 
Boethius repeatedly highlights a rule which says that if a part is removed, the whole is 
removed as well.   
Abelard makes many improvements upon Boethius.  His theory of static identity 
accounts for the relations of sameness and difference that hold between a thing and its 
part.  His theory of identity also provides a solution to the problem of material 
constitution.  With respect to the problem of persistence, Abelard assimilates Boethius’ 
rule and proposes that the loss of any part entails the annihilation of the whole.  More 
precisely, Abelard thinks that the matter of things suffers annihilation upon the gain or 
loss of even one part.  He also holds that many structured wholes, namely artifacts, are 
strictly dependent upon their parts.  Yet Abelard insists that human beings survive a 

iii 
 
variety of mereological changes.  Abelard is silent about objects which are neither 
artifacts nor persons.  I argue that Abelard has the theoretical resources to provide an 
account of the persistence of these types of object, so long as some forms are 
ontologically robust. 
Pseudo-Joscelin rejects the thesis that the removal of any part entails the 
destruction of the whole.  The annihilation of a whole follows only from the removal of 
essential parts.  Pseudo-Joscelin employs two basic principles in his theory of persistence.  
First, forms and the functions encoded in them play a primary role in identity and 
persistence.  He also makes use of a genetic criterion.  Pseudo-Joscelin expands both 
principles and employs them when he vigorously defends the thesis that a universal is a 
concrete whole composed of particulars from Abelard’s criticisms.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS 
 
 
 
 
Many persons have helped to make the completion of this dissertation possible.  
Several deserve special mention. 
Professor Josef Stern introduced me to medieval philosophy.  While advising me 
on my undergraduate thesis, he also taught me the virtues of precision in thought and 
expression.  I hope that I have not failed him much in the subsequent years. 
Professor Peter King introduced me to Abelard and Pseudo-Joscelin, and to the 
pleasures of exploring twelfth-century metaphysics.  Peter’s knowledge of Abelard and 
twelfth-century philosophy is profound, and I have learned much from our close 
collaboration on this project.  Without him, this specific project could not have happened. 
Professor Tamar Rudavsky has been a tremendous source of support as my 
current adviser.  The final stages of my work have benefited from her able guidance. 
Professor Allan Silverman has been a valuable resource, and a wonderful friend 
and colleague.  To him I owe a greater appreciation of the Greek philosophy that 
underwrites twelfth-century metaphysics. 
Portions of chapter 4 have been read before audiences at the Cornell Summer 
Colloquium in Medieval Philosophy in May 2003, the Department of Philosophy at the 
Ohio State University in November 2003, and the annual meeting of the Ohio 

vi 
 
Philosophical Association in April 2004.  I benefited immensely from the comments and 
questions raised by these audiences.  In particular, I must thank Kevin Guilfoy for his 
commentary at the OPA meeting, as well as his general enthusiasm for my project.  I also 
want to thank Scott MacDonald for his generousity and encouragement, and for 
providing a relaxed but intellectually stimulating environment at Cornell in which 
medievalists can present their work.   
Carol Hay helped me with final-hour formatting issues.  Her knowledge of 
Microsoft Word spared me uncountable hours of work, and perhaps even added several 
years to the life of my heart.  My gratitude and affection are boundless. 
None of this would be possible without the love and sacrifice of my parents 
Douglas and Patricia Arlig.  A long time ago they were forced to come to terms with the 
fact that their son was a humanist, and not a scientist.  Their support has been 
unwaivering ever since. 
Finally, I must thank my wife Rajashree Datta.  She above all has given me the 
means to bring this project to its end.  She has sacrificed much in the process.  With love 
and gratitude, I dedicate this work to her.

CHAPTER 1 
 
 
INTRODUCTION 
 
 
 
 
The twelfth-century philosopher Peter Abelard makes the bold claim that no thing 
can ever gain or lose a part.  This has the remarkable consequence that should, for 
example, the broom that is in my closet lose a hair, that very broom would no longer 
exist.  This remarkable consequence has prompted many commentators, both medieval 
and contemporary, to suggest that Abelard has made a serious mistake.  One such critic is 
the mysterious twelfth-century philosopher dubbed Pseudo-Joscelin.  Pseudo-Joscelin 
argues that a whole can gain and lose parts yet survive as that very whole.  Only the 
removal of certain parts, the so-called “principal” parts, or essential parts, will bring 
about the destruction of the whole.  Pseudo-Joscelin argues for a position that agrees with 
many of our commonsense notions about objects.  But, as I will argue, Pseudo-Joscelin’s 
philosophical position ultimately relies upon a controversial commitment to the reality 
and independence of structures, or using the Aristotelian idiom, forms.  When viewed in 
this light, Abelard’s position is far from a foolish mistake.  Rather, Abelard’s views about 
the mereological constancy of wholes are ultimately derived from his reluctance to 
hypostasize certain types of forms. 

 
 
 
2
The ubiquity of the terms ‘part’ and ‘whole’ in both our everyday speech and in 
our philosophical discourse illustrates just how fundamental these concepts are to the way 
that we think about and describe the world.  Yet despite the pervasive use of ‘part’ and 
‘whole’ in our practice, these concepts are far from clear and self-evident.  We assume 
that there are individuals.  Many of these individuals are related to each other as parts to a 
whole.  Some individuals are parts of another individual in virtue of the fact that they 
constitute, compose, or otherwise make up the latter individual.  On the other hand, some 
individuals are parts in virtue of the fact that the latter individual, the whole, can be 
divided into these individuals.  It is not obvious that all products of division are 
equivalent to the individuals that compose the whole.  Moreover, there seem to be 
different relations of existential dependence which might hold between a whole and its 
parts.  In some cases, the parts may depend upon the whole for their individuality as 
parts, and for their existence.  But in other cases, the whole may depend upon its parts for 
its existence.  If it does not depend upon all of its parts, then it seems that it must depend 
upon at least some parts.  These questions belong to the metaphysics of part and whole.  
The study of part and whole is given the name mereology.  Hence, these questions belong 
to what I will call the metaphysics of mereology.   
In chapter 2 I present what I take to be some of the primary concerns of 
metaphysical mereology.  In the contemporary literature mereology is often associated 
with the logic of the relation of part-to-whole, and accordingly, mereology is often 
treated as an extension of formal logical systems.  I argue that the logic of parts and 
wholes must be explanatorily posterior to the metaphysics.  In other words, the 

 
 
 
3
formalization of the part-to-whole relation cannot occur until we have settled the 
metaphysical issues.  In particular, I identify four broad issues that must be settled in 
metaphysical mereology.  First, we must determine when some things constitute a whole.  
Second, we must determine the conditions under which some thing is a part of another 
thing.  Third, we must determine whether parts are dependent upon their whole, or 
whether the whole is dependent upon its parts.  Finally, using our discoveries concerning 
the dependence of parts on wholes and wholes upon parts, we must determine the 
conditions under which a whole is the same whole both synchronically and 
diachronically. 
By focusing upon the metaphysical dimension of mereology, I intend to put aside 
some of the details of early medieval logic.  A full appreciation of the early medieval 
theory of part and whole would indeed have to take into account the often complex 
discussions of logical inferences including ‘part’ and ‘whole’.  I will assume, however, 
that the logic of part and whole must ultimately follow metaphysics.  For example, 
Abelard like most of his contemporaries spends a good deal of time discussing that part 
of the logical curriculum that analyses the so-called “topics”.  One of the topics is the 
“topic from the part”, which is the rule that “if a whole is, then the part is”.  A natural 
question to ponder is whether this rule is universally true, or whether there are 
exceptions.  The determination whether the rule is universal or possesses exceptions will 
ultimately depend upon how one answers the metaphysical questions.  In particular, the 
validity of the rule depends upon one’s views about the ontological dependence of the 
whole to the part.

The metaphysics of part and whole has roots deep within the history of 
philosophy.  These puzzles vexed philosophers at least as far back as Plato.1  
Mereological questions were treated with varying degrees of rigor from then up to the 
present day.  One notable chapter in this history is the treatment of metaphysical 
mereology in twelfth-century European philosophy. The history of twelfth-century 
mereology, let alone of early medieval mereology, is yet to be written.  Unfortunately, 
given the state of our knowledge of the period, no such history is likely to be 
forthcoming.  For one thing, scholars are just beginning to discover the riches buried in 
manuscripts throughout the libraries of Europe and beyond.  Until a significant portion of 
these texts are discovered, edited, and made readily available for scholarly appraisal, any 
attempt to assess the history of this period will be in principle incomplete.  While a full 
history of the early medieval period is not immediately forthcoming,2 I think that when 
                                                 
1 On Plato’s mereology, see the excellent new study by Verity Harte (2002).  To my knowledge there is no 
thorough study of Aristotle’s mereology. 
2 Some readers may not be familiar with what I mean by the early medieval tradition.  I have labeled the 
period in which Boethius, Abelard, and Pseudo-Joscelin work the early medieval period.  The period is 
initiated, for our purposes, by Boethius in the sixth century AD, and it ends with the discovery and 
assimilation of the full Aristotelian corpus in the middle-to-end of the twelfth century.  Abelard (born 1079, 
died 1142) and Pseudo-Joscelin are situated in the most intellectually fertile portion of this period.   The 
period of early medieval philosophy is marked off from late ancient philosophy, which is epitomized by the 
Greek neoplatonists and the neoplatonically influenced thought of the Church Fathers, including most 
notably Augustine.  On the other end, the early medieval period is marked off from the so-called “high 
scholasticism” epitomized by St. Thomas Aquinas, Duns Scotus, and William of Ockham.  (For the 
mereology of the later medieval Aristotelians consult Henry’s major study (1991).)  The principle for 
marking off both ends of the period is in effect the same, for the early medieval period is marked by a 
notable paucity of Aristotle’s work.  The neoplatonists of the Late Roman Empire had a good deal of 
Aristotle’s works available to them, as is born out by their numerous and lengthy commentaries on such 
works as the Categories, the De Anima, the Physics, and the Metaphysics.  High scholasticism is 
characterized by the rediscovery, assimilation, and ultimately revision of the full Aristotelian corpus.  In 
contrast, the early medieval period, for reasons still unclear, lacks all but Latin translations of Aristotle’s 
Categories and De Interpretatione.  In addition, the early medieval philosophers had the extensive 
commentaries of Boethius as well as Boethius’ independent writings.  No neoplatonic treatises survive 
except for a brief introduction to logic by Porphyry (the Isagoge), in combination with Boethius’ two 
commentaries, which preserve a good deal of the neoplatonic school’s interpretations of the treatise.

such a history appears it will not fail to include three philosophers: the Roman 
commentator and translator Boethius, Peter Abelard, and an anonymous author here 
identified as the Pseudo-Joscelin.  In this study, as a contribution to the future, complete 
history of medieval mereology, I will offer an analysis of the contributions of these three 
figures. 
No one will gain a thorough understanding of the metaphysical mereology of the 
twelfth century without first examining what the sixth-century thinker Boethius has to say 
about these issues.  Boethius is the primary source and translator of ancient Greek 
philosophical terminology, concepts, and principles to the early Middle Ages.  Mereology 
is no exception.   
In the third chapter I survey the body of mereological knowledge that Boethius 
bequeaths to the early Middle Ages.  In particular, I will look at the way that Boethius 
consolidates ancient mereological knowledge, which is usually framed around the science 
of division.  The ancient philosophers applied mereological terms to a wide variety of 
objects, including both abstract objects, such as universals, and concrete objects, or so-
called “integral wholes”.  Because mereological terminology is used to describe the 
relations between universals and individuals, some interpreters, both medieval and 
contemporary, have confused universals with integral wholes.  I will attempt to 
definitively show that the application of mereological terminology to the science of 
universals does not commit Boethius to the view that universals are a kind of integral 
                                                                                                                                                 
Sometime in the twelfth century translations of some other portions of Aristotle’s logical work, including 
the Topics, begin to surface (Iwakuma 1992, 49-50).  There is some evidence that Abelard was aware of 
some of these other logical treatises.  However, for our purposes, the Categories and Porphyry’s Isagoge 
will be the crucial Aristotelian sources.

whole.  This result both extends our understanding of Boethius, and it also sets the stage 
for the discussion of a theory developed in the twelfth century that does in fact identify 
universals as a type of integral whole.   
With universals out of the way, I will concentrate upon Boethius’ discussion of 
the metaphysics of integral wholes.  As I work through this material I will emphasize two 
features of Boethius’ mereology.  First, Boethius fails to stress the importance of the 
classical Aristotelian concept of form, and accordingly he passes over the mereologically 
pregnant notion of mutilation.  Second, Boethius presents and repeatedly highlights a rule 
commonly presented in ancient textbooks which says that if a part is removed, the whole 
is removed as well.  It is precisely for these reasons that Abelard and Joscelin emphasize 
the role that the material parts of things play in the identity and persistence conditions of 
these things.  Boethius’ emphasis of the Greek scholastic rule also encourages the 
development of a brand of mereological essentialism, which is embraced to some degree 
by Abelard. 
I have already stressed that I will not attempt to present a full history of 
mereology in the early middle ages.  However, I think it is important to give a brief 
sketch of the trajectory of medieval mereology from its founder Boethius to the twelfth-
century renaissance epitomized by Abelard and Pseudo-Joscelin.  Many details are still 
obscure, but much happens in the many centuries between Boethius and Abelard, and not 
all of it is good.  
The early medieval philosophers discovered and assimilated Aristotle’s, 
Porphyry’s, and Boethius’ writings in fits and starts.  This comes as no surprise given the 

 
 
 
7
turbulent beginnings of the early medieval period.  Boethius and his contemporaries 
sometimes act as if they are working in earnest against the onset of the loss of ancient 
learning.3  With the death of Boethius, as he feared, the medieval West does indeed sink 
into darkness.  Boethius’ translation project of Aristotle was interrupted by his untimely 
death, and the works that did not get rendered into Latin by his hand were, by and large, 
lost to the West until the end of the twelfth century. 
The fragmentary materials that do resurface are not actively studied until the ninth 
century,4 most notably under the aegis of Alcuin while he was tenured at the court of 
Charlemagne (starting in 781 AD).  In contrast to the barren seventh and eighth centuries, 
Alcuin’s work is a watershed, and in so far as Alcuin directed the collection and 
preservation of logical texts and inspired a new generation of students to tackle the 
logical texts of the Ancients, Alcuin is rightfully deserving of admiration.  But considered 
per se Alcuin’s work is highly derivative and elementary.  “It may be conceded that 
Alcuin’s educational treatises are not, judged by any standards, remarkable; indeed, they 
are mediocre.” (Laistner 1957, 201)  Alcuin’s disciples, while displaying momentary 
flashes of insight, also produce works that are introductory in scope and derivative in 
content.  Accordingly, the serious student of metaphysics and mereology will find little of 
interest in the period.   
                                                 
3 On this point see Chadwick’s study of Boethius (1981, 69), and consult Boethius’ remarks in his 
introduction to his commentary on Aristotle’s Categories (In Cat. 230c). 
4 Marenbon remarks that the seventh and eighth centuries were “barren years for intellectual life in most of 
continental Europe” (1988, 45).  What he means is that they were barren years for philosophy.  Laistner 
notes that while the continent “was withered by a blight of intellectual sterility” a “fresh and vigorous 
growth of culture was maturing in Ireland and Britain” (1957, 136).  Nonetheless this maturation was 
restricted to mostly Biblical exegesis and ecclesiastical treatises (Laistner 1957, 136-66).  On intellectual 
life on the continent during this period, consult Laistner (1957, 167-85).

Even in the tenth century there are only rare instances of mereological 
sophistication.  There is a notable change in this pattern as we approach the end of the 
eleventh century.  The later part of the eleventh century and the earliest years of the 
twelfth are characterized by a new confidence in the use of dialectical and metaphysical 
principles.  School masters are no longer content to comment upon Porphyry and 
Aristotle, using Boethius as a crutch.  They begin to assume the principles found in these 
treatises, and they attempt to apply them to theological and philosophical problems.5  Not 
surprisingly, mereology comes into its own sometime in the late eleventh century, and it 
continues to hold a significant place in the philosophical curriculum in the twelfth 
century.  Abelard and Pseudo-Joscelin are products of this twelfth-century renaissance, 
and while I cannot definitively prove this claim without doing a proper history of the 
period, I think that these two men are among the finest philosophers of their age.  
Of these two philosophers Abelard is the least in need of introduction.  He has 
long been recognized as possessing one of the outstanding intellects in the history of 
medieval philosophy.  Commentators and interpreters of Abelard’s philosophical work 
have mostly focused on his discussion of the so-called problem of universals.6  Recently 
                                                 
5 An example where philosophers begin to apply philosophical tools to theological problems is the 
controversy over transubstantiation that raged between Lanfranc of Bec and Berengar of Tours.  For a 
helpful introduction to that controversy consult Holopainen (1996). 
6 As many contemporary philosophers have argued, the problem of universals is in fact a nettle of related 
problems concerning metaphysical composition and linguistic predication.  See Moreland (2001), Oliver 
(1996), and Mellor and Oliver (1997).  On Abelard’s discussion of the problem of universals see Tweedale 
(1976), King (1982 and 2004), Spade (1994), and Gracia (1984).  Paul Spade’s extremely helpful course 
notes to Indiana University course P515 (Fall 1989), entitled History of the Problem of Universals in the 
Middle Ages, are available from his webpage (http://pvspade.com/Logic/).

a considerable amount of attention has also been given to his ethics.7  But aside from the 
pioneering work of Desmond Paul Henry, little attention has been paid to Abelard’s 
discussions of the relation between a whole and its parts.  This is truly a shame, as I think 
Abelard’s mereology is some of his most outstanding philosophical work. 
In chapter 4 I show how Abelard takes Boethius’ scholastic mereological rule to 
heart and proposes that the loss of any part entails the annihilation of that very whole.  
Yet Abelard also insists that human beings survive a variety of mereological changes.  
Abelard thinks that the material essences of things suffer annihilation upon the gain or 
loss of even one part.  He even holds that many structured wholes, such as houses and 
brooms, are dependent upon their parts in this strict sense, because the forms of these 
sorts of object weakly supervene upon the arrangements of the material parts.  But I argue 
that persons have a different, looser criterion for persistence.  From the strict 
metaphysician’s point of view, the sum of matter that makes up the person does not 
increase or decrease, it comes into being or ceases to be if mereological change occurs.  
In contrast, the person needs to retain only one part, her soul, in order to persist.   Abelard 
is silent about objects which are neither artifacts nor persons, such as stones, flowers, and 
dogs.  I offer the tentative suggestion that substances differ from artifacts in virtue of the 
type of form that informs them.  In particular, there is some evidence that the substantial 
differentiae are not dependent upon the material parts; they are somehow more real.  I 
                                                 
7 This includes a new edition and translation of his Collationes (2001).  The new Cambridge Companion to 
Abelard (Brower and Guilfoy 2004) will hopefully prompt investigations of various other aspects of 
Abelard’s thought.  

 
 
 
10
argue that if this is indeed Abelard’s view, then he has the resources to draw the sort of 
definitive distinction between artifacts and substances that he so desires.   
It appears that a number of twelfth-century philosophers were not convinced by 
Abelard’s strict analysis of artifacts or of substances, for we can detect a strong tendency 
toward what, in chapter 5, I will call the Moderate position on mereological change and 
persistence.  I focus upon the Moderate position developed by another outstanding 
representative of the twelfth century rennaissance, the Pseudo-Joscelin.  I will argue that 
Pseudo-Joscelin offers an exciting alternative to Abelard’s theory of persistence.   
The remarkable anonymous treatise On Genera and Species has been known for 
some time, and even wrongly attributed to Abelard by his nineteenth century editor 
Victor Cousin.  In Peter King’s influential study of Abelard’s theory of universals the 
author is dubbed Pseudo-Joscelin (1982).  King recognizes that On Genera presents a 
rival theory of universals that is equal to Abelard’s.  Among Abelard’s famous criticisms 
of realist theories of universals is a brief, but powerful critique of what I shall call the 
collection theory of universals.  The collection theory identifies universals, such as 
Human Being, with a mereological sum of individual humans.  Abelard thinks this theory 
deeply flawed.  Pseudo-Joscelin responds by developing a revised version of the theory.  
Both Abelard’s criticisms and Pseudo-Joscelin’s revisions of the theory rely heavily upon 
their different views about the relation of parts to their wholes.  Indeed, Pseudo-Joscelin’s 
treatise opens with a meditation on the general mereology of material objects.  In this 
study I will focus upon Pseudo-Joscelin’s general mereology and show how his theory of 
universals is a specific application of these general principles. 

 
 
 
11
Even in the case of artifacts, Pseudo-Joscelin rejects Abelard’s thesis that the 
removal of any part entails the destruction of the whole.  The annihilation of a whole 
follows only from the removal of parts principle in essence.  Thus, a chip in the 
doorframe does not annihilate this house, whereas removing a keystone in the foundation, 
or blowing a large hole in the roof, will do just that.    
Pseudo-Joscelin requires that forms, and the functions encoded in them, play a 
primary role in identity and persistence.  Consequently his system bears a degree of 
similarity to classical Aristotelianism.  The emphasis upon the role that forms must play 
in identity and persistence is the most controversial element in Pseudo-Joscelin’s system.  
This observation tempers my inclination to describe Pseudo-Joscelin’s treatment of 
metaphysical mereology as a corrective to that of Abelard.  In the concluding chapter I 
will suggest that a final verdict on the debate between Abelard and Pseudo-Joscelin must 
be determined in part by one’s other metaphysical principles.  In particular, in order to 
choose between Abelard and Pseudo-Joscelin one must determine the ontological status 
of forms.

CHAPTER 2 
 
 
INTRODUCTION TO MEREOLOGY AND THE METAPHYSICS OF MEREOLOGY 
 
 
 
 
Before turning to our medieval authors, I must offer a few remarks about 
mereology and what I am calling the metaphysics of mereology.  Mereology is 
sometimes understood as a formal, or logical, analysis of the part-to-whole relation (2.1).  
But I will claim that the formal analysis of part-to-whole must be complemented by a 
metaphysical analysis of parts and wholes.  My support for this claim is derived from the 
realization that we must resort to metaphysics in order to determine what objects count as 
wholes (2.2), and correspondingly what objects count as parts (2.3).  Both puzzles are not 
as trivial as they might first appear.  Mereology also must take into account metaphysical 
analyses of dependence (2.4).  When the metaphysician understands the relations of 
dependence that obtain between wholes and parts, this will inform her understanding of 
static identity and individuation, as well as identity through time and change, or 
persistence (2.5).  
In this chapter I will not pretend to offer definitive solutions to the puzzles 
presented.  Rather my aim is to isolate some of the key problems that the metaphysician 
must tackle when considering the relationship between wholes and their parts.  I will lay 
out a map of the conceptual terrain, and I will indicate where on this map we can locate 

 
 
 
13
our protagonists Boethius, Abelard, and Pseudo-Joscelin.  Once this is accomplished, we 
can then begin a more detailed study of the specifically medieval approach to mereology 
and the metaphysics of mereology. 
 
2.1: Formal mereology and the metaphysics of mereology 
Contemporary philosophers sometimes use ‘mereology’ to designate the formal 
theory of part and whole, which was developed consecutively by Lesniewski, and by 
Leonard and Goodman (as the “calculus of individuals”).8  By and large, contemporary 
theorists working on formal mereology have nominalist and extensionalist biases.9  In 
particular, formal mereologists have generally eschewed using tense and modal operators 
when constructing their formal systems (Simons 1987, 255 and passim).  The fact that 
formal mereology has ignored tense and modality has, as Peter Simons argues, limited 
the mereologist’s capacity to come up with a formal system that accords with many of 
our common-sense intuitions concerning the nature of objects and their relations to their 
parts.  
We need not ignore tense and modality when constructing a formal mereology, as 
Simons himself attempts to show (ibid.).  As the reader will see, medieval philosophers 
embrace to varying degrees many of the extensionalist and nominalist proclivities of 
contemporary mereology.  In particular, Abelard and his disciples, the so-called 
                                                 
8 For a helpful survey of the development of contemporary formal mereology, consult Simons (1987, 
chapter 2).  In the case of Lesniewski, Mereology is an extension of his formal system Ontology. 
9 Simons, however, insists that mereology is neutral with respect to the nominalist/realist debate (1987, 
362).  For further remarks about nominalism and realism, see chapter 4 (4.1.1). 

 
 
 
14
Nominales, have a great deal of sympathy for nominalist principles.  But even Abelard 
will need to bring in what Simons calls “extra mereological considerations”—that is, 
principles and notions not developed in purely extensional theories of part and whole—in 
order to account for the persistence and identity of objects.  These extra mereological 
considerations also fall under the philosophical inquiry into wholes, their parts, and the 
relations that bind the two.  The exploration of what extra considerations should be 
accounted for in a theory of part and whole leads us away from the logical enterprise of 
constructing purely formal systems and into the domain of metaphysical inquiry.10   
In my view, a theory of part and whole should be about real particulars and their 
parts.  Formal systems developed in abstraction from physical and metaphysical 
considerations will not suffice.  This is a bold claim on my part and a definitive defense 
of it cannot be made here.  Nonetheless, I will offer an indirect argument for this claim by 
problematizing the basic concepts of mereology, namely that of ‘whole’ and of ‘part’.  I 
will show that determining the extension of both concepts is far from a simple matter.  
Determining what counts as a whole, and what counts as a part of some whole requires 
that we have a more general fight over ontology.  Metaphysicians must determine what 
                                                 
10 I concede that metaphysics cannot be cleanly parsed from logic.  This fact is especially true for the early 
medieval philosophers treated in this study.  Nor do I think one should attempt to completely divorce 
logical matters from metaphysics.  Nonetheless, as best as possible I will attempt to focus upon the 
metaphysics of parts and wholes, and not upon purely formal matters.  Sometimes it is all too easy to slip 
into manipulating the formal system according to internal constraints, while at the same time losing track of 
the concrete datum that is to be accounted for with this formal system.  Simons acknowledges this 
suspicion: “It is tempting to be led by the attraction of internal properties of the formalism either into taking 
the world to be tamer than it is, or into a relativistic, pragmatic attitude to ontology…” (1987, 364).  He 
also puts his finger on one possible reason why mereologists have been attracted to formal theories: “The 
untidiness of natural language… is perhaps one of the chief reasons why mereologists have preferred to 
investigate formal systems with nice algebraic properties rather than get out and mix it with reality in all its 
messiness.” (1987, 236)  

 
 
 
15
things exist, what things are wholes, and what things are parts before the formal 
mereologist can help herself to these objects and determine their formal relations. 
In light of these considerations, in this study I will follow the etymology of the 
word and use the term ‘mereology’ in its broader sense as the theory of part and whole, 
where this theory need not consist of a formal algebra.  When I need to refer to the 
contemporary formal systems labeled as mereologies, I will refer to these as either formal 
mereologies or, if they conform to the principles outlined by Lesniewski or the calculus 
of individuals, as classical extensional mereologies. 
 
2.2: Mereological sums, and the problem of what things are wholes 
The problem of how to determine what things are wholes can be brought into 
relief by considering the ontological status of an item dear to classical extensional 
mereologists, the mereological sum.  Formal mereologists often use the symbol ‘+’ for 
the operation of mereological summation and ‘x + y’ (where x and y are variables) for the 
corresponding notion of a mereological sum.  The formal mereologist need not have 
adopted the summation sign to designate this operation.  Yet the suggested connection 
between mereological summation and addition is useful, but only up to a point.  
Mathematical summation is an operation applied to abstract objects, specifically 
numbers.  While I will not rule out the possibility that there are mereological sums of 
abstract objects, the sums that I will focus upon in this study are without exception sums 
of concrete objects.   

 
 
 
16
Even when we turn to concrete objects, we must proceed with caution.  One might 
think that a closer analogue to the concept of mereological summation is the looser sense 
of ‘addition’ as gathering.  For example, I can take these three apples on this table and 
add them to those oranges in the basket by tossing the apples into the basket as well.  But 
mereological summation should not be thought of as a process of gathering, nor should 
mereological sums be understood as products of this process.  As the formal mereologist 
conceives of a mereological sum, the parts need not be spatially co-located, let alone 
attached.  The mereological sum of the three apples and the three oranges would exist 
even if the apples were on the other side of the world from the oranges.  Mereological 
summation says nothing about the spatial or structural relations that obtain between its 
elements.   
A mereological sum is better thought of merely as an enumeration, or list, of the 
parts composing some whole.  This provisional characterization could be re-stated as the 
assertion that a mereological sum merely reveals the parts that constitute some whole.  It 
is a re-description of the whole in terms of its parts.  In so far as we attend to the whole 
this object is a house.  In so far as we attend to the parts of that whole it is the sum of the 
roof, the walls, and the foundation.   
By describing mereological sums in this manner I have blurred the distinction 
between constitution and identity, or rather I have tacitly assumed that constitution is 
equivalent to identity.  This is far from obvious.  Consider the house again.  It is 
constituted by the roof, walls, and foundation.  For the sake of argument these are its 
parts.  But, one could dismantle these parts and leave them in a pile on the lot.  This pile 

 
 
 
17
is also constituted by the roof, the walls, and the foundation.  If constitution is identity—
that is, if the house is identical to the mereological sum of the roof + walls + 
foundation—then one is forced to admit that the house is identical to the pile.  This does 
not accord with our common sense judgment of the matter.  Piles of house parts are not 
houses.  “Something more” seems to be required.   
A purely extensional theory of part and whole does not appear capable of 
distinguishing between piles and houses.  In purely extensional formal theories 
mereological sums are identical to their wholes.  A philosopher could take this as a 
serious metaphysical claim, but the cost would be tremendous, for most objects that we 
normally think to exist, such as houses, would accordingly behave in ways radically 
different from the ways we assume they do.  It turns out that houses can sometimes keep 
rain off of us and provide shade from the sun, and sometimes they cannot.  If we insist 
that a house must be able to shelter human beings—that this is a property that a house 
must have at every time it exists—then it looks like mereological sums of walls + floor + 
foundation are not houses.  Indeed, only a sum of walls + floor + foundation that cannot 
come undone and be a pile is a house.  In effect, most things that we take to be houses are 
not houses.   Common sense tells us that not all wholes are identical to their mereological 
sums.  Thus, on the face of it, at least some wholes are not mereological sums.   
Now consider the complementary question: Is it true that mereological sums are 
wholes?  This question raises the problem of when something is a whole.  The answer 
will depend upon whether one thinks that mere pluralities count as wholes.   

 
 
 
18
As I will show, Abelard allows mereological sums to be wholes, while he 
acknowledges the intuition that not all wholes are mereological sums (4.1.3).  Abelard 
develops a hierarchy of wholes, with mereological sums at the bottom and organic 
substances at the top.  As one moves up the hierarchy the “something else” that must be 
added is characterized by ever increasing degrees of structural complexity.  Pseudo-
Joscelin and Boethius do not explicitly proclaim that mereological sums are not wholes, 
nor do they explicitly admit that sums are wholes.  It is quite likely that Boethius’ 
treatment of division inspires Abelard to embrace a variety of wholes, including 
mereological sums (see 3.1.1), and one of Boethius’ examples of a discrete integral whole 
is the whole composed out of all men (3.1.2).  Likewise, some of Pseudo-Joscelin’s 
examples suggest that he is willing to countenance the wholeness of at least aggregates, 
and possibly also sums.11  
Many philosophers have resisted Abelard’s proposal, insisting that mereological 
sums are something distinct from wholes.  Consider for instance Verity Harte’s critique 
of David Lewis.  Lewis defends the claim that a “fusion” exists whenever many things 
exist (1991, 74).  This claim is presented as an axiom in Lewis’ system, which he calls 
the axiom of Unrestricted Composition.12  Lewis further suggests that such fusions as my 
right hand and this apple are “ontologically innocent”.  These strange fusions exist in no 
lesser manner than my body exists, and they force no further ontological commitments 
                                                 
11 See his remarks about flocks of crows in De gen. et spec. § 17 (see chapter 5, section 5.1.2). 
12 Simons calls this the “general sum principle”.  He and others find this principle suspicious.  Even some 
extensionalist theories reject the general sum principle (1987, 81-92).  Abelard embraces the general sum 
principle, although he will admit some modifications to the view that sums—or collections, as he will call 
them—are on a par with more ordinary particulars. 

 
 
 
19
over and above our commitments to the things that compose the fusion (1991, 80-1).  Our 
inattention to these weird fusions is merely a matter of preference.  Weird fusions are not 
interesting to us.  As Lewis points out, fusions such as my hand and this apple are 
“inhomogeneous, disconnected, and not in contrast with its surroundings”.  Moreover, the 
fusion is not cohesive, not causally integrated, and not a causal unit in its impact on the 
rest of the world.  These remarks imply that Lewis intends for his fusions to be not 
merely mereological sums, but also wholes.  That is, x is a fusion if and only if x is a 
whole.  But philosophers, such as Harte, have challenged Lewis’s claim that something is 
a fusion if and only if it is a whole. 
We must be clear about what is at issue.  I think Unrestricted Composition is 
unarguably true if fusions are mereological sums.  If there are some things a, b, and c, 
then there is a mereological sum a + b + c.  I also think that Unrestricted Composition 
makes a claim about wholes, since I think that fusions are a type of whole.   This second 
claim is near the heart of the dispute between Harte and Lewis.  For the most part I side 
with Lewis.  Harte’s argument boils down to this: wholes are individuals, and fusions are 
not individuals.  Therefore, fusions are not wholes.  There is a definitive difference 
between pluralities and individuals.  Lewis’ Unrestricted Composition principle forces us 
to erase this difference, or rather to assert that wherever there is a plurality, there is in 
addition an individual.  If one thinks that my hand and this apple are a whole, then one 
has admitted something more to one’s ontology.  There are now three things, a hand, an 
apple and a fusion.  If a fusion exists wherever some things exist, then an individual, 
which is not any of the things singularly, exists wherever some things exist. 

 
 
 
20
My answer is that mereological sums are individuals, but of a very weak and 
uninteresting sort.  I may be interested in the history of each apple, or I may want to focus 
my attention on the three apples as a sum.  Mereological summation allows me to treat a 
plurality of objects as an individual.  Granted, the sum does not have many of the 
properties that common sense examples of individuals possess.  It need not be spatially 
co-located.  It need not have an identifiable structure or form.  The only criterion of 
individuation, it turns out, is its membership.  The sum of the three apples and the three 
oranges exists, no matter where each apple and orange is.  The sum cannot exist if I eat 
one of the apples.  After ingestion and digestion there is now a new mereological sum of 
apples and oranges.  Therefore, if mereological sums are conceived as pluralities 
bracketed off for special attention, and thus made into individuals, I see nothing offensive 
to reason in Lewis’ principle of Unrestricted Composition.   
Harte is not satisfied because she thinks that to be an individual something more 
must obtain.  But here is the challenge to Harte and others of her persuasion: provide an 
account of the conditions under which something is no longer a plurality but rather an 
individual.   
By siding with Lewis, I do not mean to suggest that I am unsympathetic to the 
intuitions that motivate Harte and others.  I acknowledge, and I think Abelard when he is 
careful acknowledges, that some things seem to be more unified than other things.  
Pseudo-Joscelin definitely believes this.  (Boethius is harder to interpret, but I suspect 
that he too believes this.)  In other words, some things appear to move through space and 
time as a unit, and they appear to causally act as one unity.  In short, they are paradigms 

 
 
 
21
of the Aristotelian sense of ‘individual’.  This, however, is not the only sense of 
‘individual’, even in the Aristotelian school.  My preference is to claim that mereological 
sums are wholes; and if wholes must be individuals, then sums are individuals.  Instead 
of insisting that mereological sums cannot be wholes, or on the opposite extreme, that 
there is no difference between mereological sums and wholes, let us admit a hierarchy of 
wholes.  At the bottom, we will have pure pluralities.  Above that, there are aggregates, 
pluralities whose members are spatially close to one another.13  Above aggregates there 
are more complex wholes, such as artifacts and what Aristotelians call “substances”, 
which include everything from rocks and trees to lions and humans. 
Many philosophers look upon this pluralism of wholes and individuals with 
suspicion, for it seems to commit the pluralist to the claim that more than one individual 
can occupy the same place at the same time.  Consider a house.  The house is composed 
out of a roof, four walls, and a foundation.  Thus, not only is a house present, there is also 
a mereological sum roof + walls + foundation.  Since, these parts are spatially close 
together, there is also an aggregate of the roof, walls, and foundation.  Now the house is 
not the aggregate, since I could tear down the house and yet keep the parts in a pile on the 
lot.  It also is true that the aggregate is not the same as the mereological sum.  For the 
sum roof + walls + foundation would exist even if the roof and walls are transported to 
different locations.  It seems, therefore, that there are three wholes present, instead of just 
one.  Doesn’t this violate both commonsense, the principle of parsimony, and perhaps 
                                                 
13 I am using ‘aggregate’ in a sense that may be unfamiliar to those who work with the contemporary 
literature. There is no orthodox set of mereological terminology, especially in contemporary discussions of 
mereology.  Compare Lowe (1989, 88 and passim) and Burge (1977).

even a necessary truth about material objects?  If the Abelardian pluralism that I am 
currently proposing is correct, then there are three wholes in the same place at the same 
time. 
I concede that this pluralism strains commonsense.  But I think that it does not 
multiply entities unnecessarily, nor does it violate a necessary truth about material 
objects.  I will begin with the latter concern.  Some metaphysicians argue that it 
impossible for two physical objects to occupy the same place at the same time.  Others, 
most notably David Wiggins (1968), insist that this is not only possible, but it is a 
common phenomenon.  Consider a statue and the bronze out of which it is made.  The 
statue is an object, and the bronze also appears to be an object.  But it is sometimes 
argued that the bronze is not the same thing as the statue.  Melt the statue down.  The 
bronze is still there, but the statue now is not.  The two items do not share the same 
properties and therefore are two objects.  When the statue exists, Wiggins and others 
argue, the bronze also is present.  Thus, when the statue exists, two objects occupy the 
same place at the same time. 
Not every philosopher agrees with this analysis.  Some argue that only one object 
actually exists at any specific time.14  When the statue exists, the bronze does not exist.  
On their view, the bronze is there potentially, and when we melt down the statue, it “turns 
into” bronze.  This solution has an ancient pedigree, for some have claimed to find this 
                                                 
14 See Doepke’s discussion of this view (1982, 52-4).  Doepke himself rejects this and other “reductionist” 
solutions, favoring instead the view that some objects are substrata for change.  See also Simons (1987, 210 
ff.). 

 
 
 
23
view in Aristotle.15  But as Doepke rightly points out, claiming that the bronze comes into 
existence upon destruction of the statue “calls for explanation” (1982, 53).  The statue has 
certain properties, such as place, weight, and color, which remain after the statue is 
melted down.  If the bronze did not exist when the statue existed, we have the right to 
wonder why it is that the bronze just happens to now possess the weight, place and color 
that the statue previously possessed.  On the other hand, this “gratuitous mystery” is 
erased if we suppose that the bronze was there all along and is the substratum of the 
change imposed by melting the statue. 
I do not pretend to claim that Doepke has the final word on this traditional 
metaphysical puzzle.  But these considerations should be enough to demonstrate that we 
do not violate a necessary law of physics if we assert that two objects can be present in 
the same place at the same time.  
Let us now turn to the second complaint against Abelardian pluralism, namely 
that it appears to multiply entities unnecessarily.  In my view, Abelard and other 
pluralists multiply entities for good reason.  To aid my discussion of these matters, let me 
introduce a mereological convention of my own.  Here and throughout this study I will 
often use brackets ({…}) to differentiate between an aggregate and a mereological sum.  
Accordingly, ‘roof + walls + foundation’ denotes a mereological sum, whereas ‘{roof + 
                                                 
15 Doepke cites Barrington Jones’ (1974) interpretation of Aristotle (Doepke 1982, 53 note 10).  In his 
Opuscula John Philoponus claims that some parts are potentially in the whole, others are present in act.  
Philoponus singles out the four elements as things that exist only in potentiality (Opuscula IV § 4, p. 130).  
This is Philoponus’ way of negotiating between two puzzles.  The first is an explicit statement of the many 
and the one: the whole is one, the parts are many.  If both are present in act, then the same thing is both one 
and many.  But, so the second puzzle states, if one claims that the whole is in act, one cannot claim (as 
Philoponus thinks Aristotle does) that the parts exist only in potentiality.  The whole and its parts are 
relative to one another.  Hence, if the whole exists in act, then the part must exist in act (Opuscula 
Monophysitica IV § 1, p. 126). 

 
 
 
24
walls + foundation}’ denotes an aggregate.  Below I will claim that sums and aggregates 
share a lot of the same properties (2.5).  These similarities between aggregates and sums 
are suggested by retaining the summation sign in the symbolic representation of 
aggregation.   
Now reconsider the pluralist’s claim that there is not only a house, but also an 
aggregate of bricks and boards, and a mereological sum of bricks and boards.  The enemy 
of the pluralist complains that this analysis yields three wholes, where there is only need 
for one.  But if the enemy of the pluralist is correct, which single whole exists, and which 
two are unnecessary ontological additions?   
Let is consider the possibilities in turn.  One could deny that mereological sums 
and aggregates exist, insisting that only wholes such as houses, dogs and humans exist.  
This claim should be distinguished from the reductivist claim made above that the matter 
of an object does not exist while that object exists.  The enemy of pluralism is not 
denying that the bricks and boards exist while the house exists, rather she is merely 
resisting Lewis’ axiom of Unrestricted Composition, which states that since the bricks 
and boards exist, a sum of these bricks and boards exists, as well as a complementary 
claim that, while these bricks and boards are in close spatial proximity, an aggregate of 
these things exists.   
I find the denial of the existence of aggregates and sums problematic, especially if 
we side with Doepke and insist that the bricks and the boards exist at the same time that 
the house exists.  Consider the simple fact that a pile of house parts is not a house.  A pile 
of house parts looks like a perfectly serviceable paradigm of an aggregate.  One might 

 
 
 
25
resist by asserting that the pile is not an aggregate.  It is a pile.  There are things like 
houses, and there are things like piles, but not things like aggregates.  But piles sure look 
like aggregates, especially if an aggregate is defined as a collection of co-located things.  
This definition makes no mention of structure, or the lack of structure.  Accordingly, the 
aggregate {roof + walls + foundation} exists when arranged pile-wise, and when 
arranged house-wise.  Thus, if it is impossible for a house and an aggregate to exist at the 
same time and in the same place, it looks like the aggregate has just as good a claim as 
the house to be the one thing present.  Maybe, then, there are wholes and aggregates, but 
no mereological sums.  This won’t work either.  In the analysis of the house, the 
mereological sum under dispute is roof + walls + foundation.  But if I deny that this sum 
exists, it seems I must assert that at least one of the parts does not exist.  But if at least 
one part of the house does not exist, the house cannot exist.  One might reply that she 
does not dispute that the parts exist, she only objects that the mereological sum of these 
parts also exists.  I argued, however, that the mereological sum just is the parts 
considered together as a unit.  Thus, if the roof, walls, and foundation exist, the sum 
exists. 
So far we have only considered enemies of pluralism who deny Unrestricted 
Composition.  But there are other reductivists who will want to resist Abelardian 
pluralism.  These reductivist philosophers will insist that mereological sums are the only 
things that really exist, and that all these putative complex wholes are not real.  This is 
certainly a coherent strategy, but it strikes me as extreme.  It fails to account for our 
experience that things like houses and especially organisms are unified.  They are 

 
 
 
26
individuals in a much stronger sense than mereological sums are.  Mereological sums 
may be individuals since they can be identified and re-identified.  But an organism is not 
only individual in this basic sense; it is cohesive and connected, and it contrasts with its 
surroundings, and is causally integrated (Lewis 1991, 80-1). 
Therefore, in order to reject Abelardian pluralism one must either eliminate sums 
and aggregates, or one must eliminate artifacts and organisms.  Neither option strikes me 
as very enticing.  Abelard’s pluralism might at first seem strange, but on further 
examination, it seems to capture common-sense much better than either reductivist 
strategy.  As for the complaint that Abelard multiplies entities without necessity, it now 
seems clear that the multiplication is not superfluous.  More importantly, as I will show, 
Abelard’s brand of pluralism does not amount to a straightforward multiplication of 
numerically distinct entities.  The apparent violation of parsimony is generated by 
assuming that the fact that {roof + walls + foundation} is not the same as the house 
(which, when understood correctly, is true) entails that the house and {roof + walls + 
foundation} are entirely distinct, or as he puts it “numerically different”.  Abelard denies 
that difference entails distinctness (4.2.1).   
As the discussion of mereological sums should have made clear, when developing 
a formal system of parts and wholes, one must eventually attend to the way the world is.  
Our metaphysics, or perhaps physics, must determine what putative objects exist.16  If we 
determine that what really exists are simple substances that are constantly rearranged, 
                                                 
16 Early medieval philosophers do not distinguish between physics and metaphysics.  The two sciences fall 
under the rubric of “natural philosophy”.  Abelard's defense of the view that parts and wholes are things as 
opposed to merely utterances can be taken as tacit approval of my claim that mereology begins with the 
study of the nature of things, and not with an analysis of language and logic (see Dial. 554.37-555.9).   

 
 
 
27
then a purely extensional formal system just might suffice.  But if our metaphysical 
speculations determine that no such elimination is viable or desirable, and if we admit 
items such as houses and organisms into our ontology, then a purely extensional system 
will not suffice.   
 
2.3: When is something a part? 
My inquiry into the relation between mereological sums, aggregates, and more 
complex individuals raised the issue of what things are wholes.  A corollary to that 
problem is this: What things qualify as parts?  Classical extensional mereology by and 
large assumes that in complex things—that is, things consisting of simpler things—any 
thing that is present in the complex is also a part of that complex.  The engine, the 
pistons, the metal constituting the piston, and the atoms of the piston are all equally parts 
of my car.  But as we will see there are reasons for challenging this assumption. 
Intuitively we all have a sense of what ‘part’ means.  Everyday examples of parts 
abound.  Here is a sample of objects and their parts: 
Whole  
 
Parts 
Man 
 
 
Head, Hands, Feet 
House  
 
Roof, Walls, Foundation 
Sentence 
 
Words 
Baseball Game 
Inning 

 
 
 
28
Once we attempt to make the concept of a part more precise, the matter becomes much 
more difficult.17  For starters, the examples provided above constitute what contemporary 
mereologists describe as “proper parts”.  Hence, Socrates’ hand is a proper part of 
Socrates (Socrates’ hand << Socrates).  But many mereologists also think that Socrates 
can be a part of himself.  They designate this by saying that Socrates is an improper part 
of himself (Socrates < Socrates).  The two concepts are inter-definable,18 and different 
formal systems take one or the other notion as primitive and in turn define the other in 
terms of the former (Simons 1987, 9-11 and 53-56).  For example, we might define being 
a part of something in terms of the proper part relation, so that x < y =def x << y or x = 
y.19   
                                                 
17 Some philosophers go so far as to claim that there is no single root sense of ‘part’.  I will call this the 
equivocal theory of parthood.  Peter Van Inwagen flirts with this view.  “There is one relation called 
‘parthood’ whose field comprises material objects and those things like elementary particles which are not 
clear cases of material objects but which share many of their salient features…  There is another relation 
called ‘parthood’ defined on events, another still defined on stories, yet another defined on curves, and so 
on, through an indefinitely large class of cases. And yet it is no accident—as it is with the pitch of a roof 
and the pitch of a whistle—that we apply the same word in each case, for these applications are bound 
together by a ‘unity of analogy’.”  (1990, 19)  While he acknowledges the variety of senses of ‘part’ 
employed in everyday language, Van Inwagen still insists that when the domain is restricted to material 
objects the term ‘part’ is univocal.  And indeed, Van Inwagen’s remarks suggest something less extreme 
than an equivocal theory of parthood—namely, an analogical theory of parthood.  An analogical theory 
proposes that there is one set of simpler items that are contained in the complex thing that are true parts, 
and that there are other things that are “parts” only in a looser, adapted sense.  While the equivocal theory 
of parthood strikes me as extreme, the analogical theory seems promising. 
18 I am glossing over another interpretation of the relational predicate ‘_ < _’.  Some interpret the predicate 
as ‘is part of’, others as ‘is a part of’ (Sharvy 1983, passim; Simons 1987, 232-37).  What they have in 
mind is something like the following: ‘x is part of y’ often means that x is some of y.  In other words, ‘is 
part of’ is often used when describing the composition of masses and mixtures.  In contrast, ‘x is a part of 
y’ claims something more.  Coffee is part of a latte, but coffee is not a part of a latte.   
19 Simons notes that some formal mereologies take the concept of overlap as primitive, and define ‘part’ 
and ‘proper part’ in terms of this concept (1987, 48).  Still others take the concept of being disjoint as 
primitive (idem. 53, and Rescher 1955, 9).  I omit the option of using overlap as a primitive, since I think 
that the concept of overlap is conceptually posterior to our concept of a part.  Disjointedness has more 
intuitive pull, since at first pass it seems that we cannot discern two things as being proper parts of some 
third thing unless we perceive the two as distinct (i.e. disjoint) from one another.  I find disjointedness to be 
less desirable however, since it makes the phenomenon of overlap more difficult to define. 

 
 
 
29
At this point I should highlight a difference in terminology between contemporary 
mereology and ancient mereology.  Contemporary mereology deals with the relation of 
being a part of something.  Ancient authors recognize that the terms ‘part’ and ‘whole’ 
signify relatives (ta pros ti).20  Wholes necessarily have parts, and parts are necessarily 
parts of something, namely a whole.  The relation that holds between part and whole is 
“containment” (see 3.1.1).  The whole contains its parts.  The parts are contained in the 
whole.  Contemporary philosophy in general accords much more status to relations as 
properties, often thinking of properties signified by n-place (where n > 1) predicates as on 
a par with properties signified by one-place predicates.  In contrast, ancient and medieval 
philosophers tend to focus almost exclusively on those properties denoted by one-place 
predicates.  In the Aristotelian tradition ta pros ti are accidents, and like all accidents, 
they ultimately depend upon the substances to which they belong.  But relations are 
especially troubling for ancient and medieval thinkers because they are properties shared 
by more than one subject.  I will not go into details here, but without exception the 
relations identified as ta pros ti—including the relative terms ‘part’ and ‘whole’—are 
reduced to the properties of their relata.21  
                                                 
20 Ammonius In Isag. 91, 9-17; Ps-El. 38, 28-31; Arethas Sch. 65, 23-66, 15.  Barnes identifies the source 
of this principle as Plato’s Parmenides (137c).  On the Platonic heritage see Barnes’ summary (1988, 230-
231).  
21 Ancient and medieval authors emphasize that the things which are wholes and parts are not in and of 
themselves relatives.  In the Categories Aristotle raises the puzzle of the status of a thing’s parts.  If a head 
is a part, and hence a relative, it cannot be a substance.  The relative is one of the accidental categories, and 
no accident is a substance.  Once this problem is broached, Aristotle attempts to re-define ta pros ti in such 
a way that the parts of a substance are themselves substances (Cat. 8b15-21).  The commentary tradition 
discusses this Aristotelian puzzle, and Aristotle’s proposed resolution.  A typical interpretation of the 
Aristotelian solution is that a head qua head is not a relative, but a head qua part is a relative (see Amm. In 
Cat. 77.24-26).  There is nothing strange about the claim that the same thing, when considered with respect 
to different aspects, can fall under more than one Aristotelian category.  See, for example, Aristotle’s 
remarks about things which are “accidental” quantities (Cat. 5a38-5b10). 

 
 
 
30
 I mention this difference only to eliminate possible confusion, yet I think nothing 
crucial follows from it.  I will move freely between talk of parts and wholes and the part-
whole relations with the understanding that the terms ‘part’ and ‘whole’ ultimately 
signify things in so far as they stand in relation to one another.  Thus, speaking more 
loosely, our medieval authors tend to think of parts strictly in terms of proper parts.  
There are no clear cases where an ancient or medieval author discusses the properties of 
improper parts.   
Proper parts, it is generally argued, have the following basic properties.  These 
properties are often made axioms in formal mereological systems: 
Asymmetry: if x << y, then it is not the case that y << x. 
 
Transitivity: if x << y and y << z, then x << z. 
 
Supplementation: if x << y, then there is some other thing, z, such that x is not z, 
x does not share any parts with z, and z << y.  That is, y has more than one proper 
part.22 
 
Falsehood: if x << y, then x and y both actually exist. 
 
Simons argues that this is the “formal skeleton” of the meaning of ‘part’ (1987, 362).23  
And indeed, initial examination of the examples above goes some ways toward 
warranting the assumption that these properties generally hold for an object’s proper 
parts. 
                                                 
22 This is a somewhat simplified characterization of Simons’ treatment of the principle (1987, 362). 
23 In a later paper co-authored with Charles Dement, Simons argues that the formal skeleton of the notion 
of part is built around the concept of improper parthood (<).  A proper part is then defined as a part of x 
such that x is not a part of it.  Asymmetry is replaced by Reflexivity: if x exists, then x < x (Simons and 
Dement 1996, 262-3).  Compare the axioms presented by Simons and Dement with Fine’s axioms (1995, 
469) and the axioms elucidated by Rescher (1955, 9). 

 
 
 
31
While this list of properties appears to capture the basic features of what we think 
of as parts, it must be stressed that these axioms do not completely characterize the 
properties of all those items that we ordinarily call parts (Simons 1987, 235).  It might 
even by the case that there are exceptions to these rules, especially when we consider the 
variety of parts possessed by organisms.  For example, consider this puzzle: a heart << a 
man’s body.  A man’s body is composed of matter.  Does it follow that a heart << the 
man’s matter?24  If it does not, then Transitivity is not universal. 
In a co-authored paper, Simons and Dement argue that in the case of artifacts 
there are numerous senses of ‘part’ that come into play, many of which are much 
stronger—i.e. much more restricted—notions than the “skeletal” concept of ‘part’ (1996, 
263-66).  For example, some things are parts of an artifact in the sense that they are 
“assembly components” of the artifact.  Other parts are “disassembly components” of the 
same artifact.  The two sets of components are not necessarily the same, since it is often 
the case that due to bonding methods applied in assembly, objects cannot be taken apart 
in the same manner that they were put together.  A third type of part that occurs in 
artifacts (and organisms) is a “functional component”.  Some functional components are 
also assembly components, some are not.  A carburetor is an example of the former, the 
braking system of the latter.  Still other parts—for example, the front and back half of a 
car—seem to not be components at all; and indeed some philosophers argue against the 
existence or ontological significance of these “arbitrary undetached parts” (Van Inwagen 
1981). 
                                                 
24 The puzzle is mentioned and resolved by Peter Simons (1987, 244-47). 

 
 
 
32
One way to draw a distinction between true parts and Pseudo-parts would be to 
claim that any thing that is a simpler item contained in a complex item is a constituent of 
that complex, but that there is a difference between being a constituent and being a part.  
Parts would be a sub-set of an object’s constituents.  Of course, it is now incumbent upon 
this theorist to show how we are to mark off this important sub-set.   
One proposal is that the parts must themselves be individuals, or at least 
sufficiently like individuals.  This is a plausible way to discount spatial parts as true parts, 
since the top half of my body is not an individual in the same sense that my hand is an 
individual.  My hand has its own distinguishing characteristics that distinguish it from my 
head and my feet.  The top half of my hand, in contrast, is derivative upon readily 
individuated parts of me.  I could not pick out the top half of my hand without first 
individuating my hand.  But there are several worries with this proposed criterion.  First, 
it is not uncontroversial to claim that items like hands and heads are individuals.  Some 
philosophers in the Aristotelian tradition reject the view that the parts of individual 
substances are themselves full-blooded individual substances.  This is not an 
insurmountable objection, if the Aristotelian is willing to humor the weaker claim that 
parts must be sufficiently like individuals.  The trouble is, however, that this criterion still 
leaves us with a variety of items claiming the status of parts.  The atoms constituting my 
car are individual.  The assembly parts of my car are individual, but perhaps distinct from 
the disassembly parts of my car.  Are these individuals all parts in the same sense? 
The biggest worry with the first proposed criterion for parthood is that the more 
individual the parts are allowed to become, the greater the puzzle of composition 

 
 
 
33
becomes.  The puzzle of composition is a version of the problem of the one and the 
many, and can be roughly stated as follows: how do we get one individual, and not just a 
collection, out of many individuals?25  Cars and human bodies are unified entities, and 
not just piles of simpler individuals.  A car is different from a pile of pistons, spark plugs, 
belts, gears, tires, etc.  Perhaps most significantly, the car can act in ways that the pile 
cannot—such as travel at 65mph down the freeway.  More controversially, as we will see 
below, some philosophers think that my car can lose and gain parts and remain my car, 
whereas a pile of car ‘parts’ cannot. 
These considerations indicate that mere individuality might not provide a criterion 
for when something is a part of another thing.  As we will see in due time, Abelard 
suggests that the parts of some thing must be such that they continue to exist after the 
creation of the composite (4.1.3).  Thus, for example, the eggs and flour are not parts of 
the cake, since the eggs and flour are not still present after they are combined and the 
mixture is baked.   
I mention but one more possible criterion, as it will introduce a puzzle that I will 
pick up again shortly.  We might propose that if x is a constituent of y, it is possible that x 
is not present in y at some time during y’s existence.  On the other hand, if x is a part of 
y, necessarily x exists at every time that y exists.  This criterion is suggested by the 
common Aristotelian dictum that the whole is that of which no part is lacking (see 3.3.4).  
                                                 
25 In her study of Plato’s mereology, Verity Harte identifies the problem of composition—i.e. how can 
many things compose one thing?—as an aspect of the many-faceted problem of the one and the many 
(2002, 26).  Harte’s problem of composition is the same as Van Inwagen’s “Special Composition 
Question”: under what conditions do some things (“the xs”) compose y? (1990, 21-31; cf. Van Inwagen 
1987).  As Harte notes, this is not just a worry about counting, and hence it is not the confusion that Frege 
eliminates in his Foundations of Arithmetic § 46.   

 
 
 
34
The problem is that I pre-reflectively think both that my hand is a part of me and that I 
can survive as a whole even if I lose my hand.  Either my hand is not a part of me, or I do 
not exist as a whole after losing my hand. 
The upshot of these considerations is that drawing a distinction between 
constituents and parts is far from a simple matter.  Determining whether something is a 
part of another thing will depend upon such matters as one’s metaphysical theory of 
individuals, and one’s treatment of the problem of the one and the many.   
As with the problem of determining what things can be wholes, our three 
medieval authors tackle the problem of determining what items are parts to varying 
degrees.  Aside from the previous remark about the distinction between ingredients and 
parts, Abelard does not worry extensively about what items belonging to wholes count as 
true parts.  This is probably due, again, to his reading of Boethius.  Boethius’ definitions 
of parts are not as consistent and precise as we would like (3.3.2).  However, Abelard 
raises some worries about what items count as parts when he critiques the collection 
theory of universals (5.2.2).  Accordingly, Pseudo-Joscelin must address Abelard’s 
concerns about parthood when he defends his version of the collection theory (5.2.3). 
While examining when something is a whole and when something is a part, we 
have already stumbled across three central and related metaphysical questions concerning 
parts and wholes.  First, in what ways do the parts depend upon their whole, and 
conversely, in what ways do wholes depend upon their parts?  Second, what must be the 
case mereologically speaking in order for the whole to be identical, both to itself and to 
its parts, at a single moment in time?  And finally, what must be true mereologically 

 
 
 
35
speaking for a whole to be the same whole over time and through change?  Our medieval 
authors will not always frame these questions this way, or for that matter, always take 
care to tease these issues apart.  But it will help our understanding of medieval 
metaphysical mereology if we attempt to separate these issues and outline the approaches 
that one might take to answer these three metaphysical questions.   
 
2.4: Dependence 
Metaphysicians have asserted that parts and wholes share various relations of 
dependence to one another.  Some assert that parts depend upon their wholes.  Others 
assert that wholes depend upon their parts.  There are a variety of ways in which one item 
depends upon another.  In metaphysical mereology, the type of dependence that we are 
interested in is ontological dependence.  Our description of ontological dependence will 
have ramifications for how we will develop an account of the identity of wholes.26 
 
2.4.1: Varieties of ontological dependence 
To say that some thing is ontologically dependent upon another thing has several 
senses.  The first sense of ‘x ontologically depends upon y’ is that y is a necessary 
condition for x’s existence simpliciter.  That is, if x exists, then y must exist.  We will 
reserve the label ‘existential dependence’ for this variety of ontological dependence. 
Another way in which something may depend upon another thing for its existence 
is that y is the origin of x.  That is, if x exists, then y once existed.  But just because y 
                                                 
26 For a more thorough analysis of dependence consult Simons (1987: 290-323). 

 
 
 
36
once existed, it need not still exist in order for x to continue existing.  The previous mode 
of ontological dependence is hence much stronger than this genetic dependence.  A child 
is ontologically dependent upon her parents in the sense that she is genetically dependent 
upon her parents.  
A third way in which something can be ontologically dependent upon another 
thing is when x depends upon y in order to exist as this sort of thing.  If x is an F, then y 
exists.  This last type of ontological dependence seems to be at least part of what 
Aristotle means when he famously claims that a severed hand is only a hand “in name”, 
not in definition.  In other words, Socrates’ hand is only a hand so long as Socrates exists.  
Should we kill Socrates, this hunk of fleshy stuff changes in respect to the kind of thing it 
is.  It is no longer a hand.  Aristotle also suggests that Socrates’ hand ceases to be a hand 
if it is severed and Socrates nevertheless continues existing (see below 2.4.3).  Thus, a 
stronger version of this mode of ontological dependence is something like the following: 
if x is an F, y exists and x << y.  I will call these weaker and stronger versions of this type 
of dependence sortal dependence.   
Having identified several senses of ontological dependence, I now want to briefly 
meditate upon the two claims that wholes ontologically depend upon their parts (2.4.2), 
and that parts ontologically depend upon their wholes (2.4.3).   
 
2.4.2: Dependence of the whole upon its parts 
My suspicion is that the modern reader will find the notion that the whole is 
ontologically dependent upon its parts more readily intelligible..  Wholes appear to be at 

 
 
 
37
least weakly dependent upon a set of parts for their origins.  My house required a set of 
boards, nails and bricks to exist in order for it to exist.  However, depending upon what 
things can be parts, the weak genetic claim may not be universalizable.  Consider 
Abelard’s distinction between ingredients and parts, which can be illustrated by 
considering a cake.  The cake depends upon the eggs and flour for its origin.  But if 
Abelard is correct, the eggs and flour are not parts of the cake.  Even when these 
examples are put aside, it is crucial to note that the thesis that wholes weakly depend 
upon parts for their origin does not entail specific commitments about whether these parts 
still make up this whole.  Moreover, it is possible to weaken the genetic dependency 
thesis even further and deny that it must be this particular set of parts that bring about the 
existence of this individual.  That is to say, according to this weakest version of the 
genetic dependence thesis, Socrates could have been made out of this material rather than 
that material.  The only requirement might be that any material that brings about the 
existence of Socrates must be of the right sort.  (Socrates could not have been made out 
of silicon or chocolate.) 
A stronger thesis than the genetic dependence thesis is that the whole depends 
upon its parts in order to continue to exist.  Aside from cases like Abelard’s cake, the 
thesis can naturally be understood to claim that the whole depends upon its parts both in 
order to come into being and in order to exist.  The existential dependence thesis is 
stronger since it covers the conditions of existence per se, whereas the genetic thesis  

 
 
 
38
focuses upon the conditions at the moment when existence begins.  The thesis of 
existential dependency can, thus, cover cases where the object in question is eternal, and 
hence, has no origin.   
This thesis of existential dependence admits degrees.  At its weakest, the claim 
amounts to the claim that the whole depends upon the right type of parts for its existence.  
Stronger versions claim that at least an essential sub-set of the parts must exist in order 
for the whole to exist.  To use a crude example, Socrates’ heart and brain must exist in 
order for Socrates to exist, but it is possible for Socrates to exist even if his hand does not 
exist.  As we will see, Pseudo-Joscelin proposes a version of the thesis that the whole 
existentially depends upon a specific sub-set of the individual’s parts. 
The strongest version of the existential dependence thesis states that this 
particular set of parts (and no other) must exist in order for this whole to exist.  The 
strongest existential dependence thesis is sometimes labeled “mereological essentialism”.  
Mereological essentialism can be understood without reference to time or with reference 
to time.  The atemporal version states that, if a whole is a + b + c then it is not possible 
for this whole to be anything but a + b + c.  For example, it is impossible that this whole 
is a + b + d.  The temporal version of mereological essentialism makes specific reference 
to time, claiming that whenever this whole exists, this particular set of parts must exist.  
Consequently, using the example of the whole that is a + b + c, if at some time one of the 
parts, say c, were annihilated, the whole would cease to exist.  The latter version is, 
hence, a thesis not only about existential dependence but about persistence, or identity 
through time. 

 
 
 
39
Even in its strongest form, the essentialist’s claim may only amount to laying 
down a necessary condition, and not a sufficient condition.  The parts may exist yet be 
scattered in such a way that the whole does not exist.  This is especially true if one thinks 
that structure plays a significant role in the being of a whole.  This is crucial to 
remember, since I will show that while Abelard is attracted to strong versions of 
mereological essentialism, he also admits the importance of structure for determining the 
conditions under which certain, more complex types of whole exist (4.3).   
 
2.4.3: Dependence of the part on the whole 
Not all philosophers think that the primary relation of dependence is that of a 
whole on its parts.  Aristotle can be interpreted as claiming that at least some parts 
ontologically depend upon their wholes.  Should an eye lose its power to see, it would be 
an eye “only in name” (De Anima II.1, 412b20-22).  I will refer to this claim as 
Aristotle’s principle of homonomy.  One way that an eye could lose its power to see is by 
removing it from someone’s skull—that is, removing it from the whole.  Thus, it would 
seem that such parts as eyes and hands are ontologically dependent upon their wholes.  
But precisely which mode of ontological dependence is being singled out by this 
principle of homonomy?  
At the very least, the Aristotelian means that the part is genetically dependent 
upon its whole.  But the Aristotelian dictum is also making a claim about sortal 
dependence.  We can give this a modern biological twist to make the claim somewhat 
more intelligible.  Let us consider one part of a human being, a hand.  A human hand is 

 
 
 
40
defined in terms of the fact that it is always part of a human being, and that under normal 
conditions it plays a specific role in the normal functions of human beings.  Spun another 
way, the human hand is defined by human genes, and human beings as they develop will 
normally develop hands.  Indeed, human hands are only grown by human beings.  They 
do not grow on trees, or even on chimpanzees.  The hands that grow on chimpanzees, 
while very similar to human hands, are chimpanzee hands, not human hands.  
It is instructive to remember that, for the Aristotelian, the sortal dependence of 
parts upon their whole is characterized by functionality, and not just structure.   For some 
amount of time after separation, this severed thing still has the shape of a hand, but for 
the Aristotelian the shape is generally not enough to qualify as falling under a sort.  For 
the Aristotelian, human hands are functionally defined.  They are hands in so far as they 
can perform the activities that human hands and eyes perform.  Once severed, that which 
was a hand can no longer grasp things, draw, make gestures, pick up blueberries, and so 
forth.  For this reason the Aristotelian thinks they are not hands. 
In an age when severed hands remained severed, the Aristotelian’s view is 
perhaps not unreasonable.  I think that some of our current distrust of the Aristotelian 
position comes from the fact that we now live in an age when severed hands are 
sometimes reattached (and even regain some degree of functionality) and organ 
transplants are commonplace.  Aristotle’s doctrine, when espoused in our world, seems to 
commit him to the mysterious view that a hand (or an eye, or a heart) can go in and out of 
existence.   

 
 
 
41
Perhaps this oddity is tempered when the claim is interpreted as a claim about 
genetic and sortal dependence.  But the mystery creeps back in when one considers other 
functionally defined parts.  Unlike the heterogeneous parts of organisms, which appear to 
depend upon their wholes for their origin, many complex, heterogeneous parts of artifacts 
do not appear to depend upon their wholes even in this way.  Consider a spark plug.  It is 
manufactured by the thousands independently of any particular car (indeed, of any 
particular type of car).  This sparkplug does not depend upon my car for its origin, let 
alone (it seems) for its sortal existence.  The Aristotelian move that it is not actually a 
spark plug when sitting upon a warehouse shelf runs into a crucial disanalogy.  If, for the 
sake of argument, we bracket contemporary advances in surgery and instead assume that 
we inhabit Aristotle’s age, Socrates’ hand when severed is no longer even potentially able 
to perform hand functions.  But a sparkplug, so long as it is not used up, is potentially 
able to ignite gasoline and air even when it is sitting on the shelf.  If it did not have this 
potential, I would refuse to purchase it. 
One might object that while my spark plug does not require the existence of my 
car for its origin or existence as a spark plug, it still requires that some car exist, or at 
least that the blueprints for cars exist.  The spark plug, hence, depends in some sense 
upon the existence of cars (or the universal, Car) for its origin and existence.  This thing 
might depend upon the blueprint for a car for its existence as a spark plug.  Its falling 
under a sort depends upon it fulfilling, or being capable of fulfilling a function that is  

 
 
 
42
defined by the blueprint for the whole.  But note that this is a different, and I claim much 
weaker, assertion than the Aristotelian assertion that Socrates’ hand depends upon 
Socrates.  
These are some of the ways that we might try to understand the Aristotelian claim 
that many parts are dependent upon their whole.  I will sometimes refer to this 
Aristotelian dictum in the coming chapters, but usually I will do so in order to contrast 
classical Aristotelianism with the early medieval understanding of Aristotle.  For Abelard 
and Pseudo-Joscelin in particular, the parts will always enjoy a degree of ontological 
independence from their wholes.   
This last claim comes into conflict with a view defended by an important 
contemporary scholar of early medieval mereology.  In his studies of medieval 
mereology, Desmond Paul Henry draws a distinction that corresponds to some of the 
characteristics of parts and wholes that the Aristotelian has mapped out, and he claims 
that at least Abelard sometimes subscribes to this distinction.27  In order to deny Henry’s 
interpretation, I first need to outline the distinction that Henry employs. 
Henry’s distinction between X-parts and parts-of-X is designed to describe the 
change that occurs when the spark plug, which was lying on the shelf at the warehouse, 
becomes incorporated in my car.  The spark plug on the shelf is a car-part.  That is to say, 
the plug qua car-part is a part designed to be a part of some car or other, but it is not 
currently incorporated into any particular car.  The spark plug in my car is now a part-of-
                                                 
27 Henry identifies, to list only a few, the following places in Abelard’s writings: In de Div. 163.20-31; 
Dial. 431.23-432.5, 344.18-345.6; Log. Ingr. 2, 171.4-22.  See Henry’s discussion of these passages (1991, 
51 and 81-89; cf. 1985, 75-80).  Henry makes much of the fact that Abelard picks up the linguistic point 
that predication of an integral whole can only occur in the genitive case.   

 
 
 
43
a-car.  The spark plug has been incorporated into a whole with not only the right parts, 
but also the right structure (Henry 1991, 82).  It is not a constitutive feature of being an 
instance of a car-part that the plug is designed to be a part of a car.  If I were to cut my 
car in half with a blow torch, the front and back halves of my car would also be car-parts 
(Henry 1991, 48).  In general, the X-parts may be parts that pre-exist the X.  They may 
also be parts that, first pre-existed the X, then were incorporated into an X, and finally 
post-date the X.  And, as my example of my halved car, X-parts may be the sorts of 
things that did not pre-exist the X, but are created along with the X and can remain after 
the dissolution of that X. 
Henry sometimes talks as if X-parts and parts-of-X are exclusive classes of part—
i.e. a is an X-part if and only if a is not a part-of-(an)-X.  For example, he says that 
“parts-of-X may become X-parts without ever having been components in the sense of 
ready-made incorporable parts” (1991, 48).  Taken at face value, Henry is suggesting that 
the carburetor on the shelf is a car-part only.  When installed in my car, the carburetor 
then becomes only a part-of-a-car, and not also a car-part.  And finally, when the 
carburetor is salvaged, it once more becomes a car-part, and only a car-part.  This change 
in status from X-part to part-of-X will turn out to be important later. 
Henry thinks that the distinction between X-parts and parts-of-X is useful because 
it will help disentangle several metaphysical knots.  For example, as I will show in 
chapter 4 (4.3.2), the early medieval philosophers were puzzled by the fact that while the 
existence of a part generally does not entail the existence of its whole, in the case of 
“temporal wholes”—for example, a day—the existence of any part does entail the 

 
 
 
44
existence of the whole.  If the first hour of the day exists, then the day exists.  Henry 
suggests that the puzzle can be dissolved by noting the distinction between X-parts and 
parts-of-X.  It is true that if a part-of-an-X exists, then necessarily that X exists.  But if an 
X-part exists, it is not necessary that an X exists (Henry 1984, 255; 1991, 140-42). 
I want to argue that Abelard and Pseudo-Joscelin do not avail themselves of this 
distinction, or anything like Aristotle’s principle of homonomy.  Henry complains that, 
for instance, Abelard does not utilize the distinction between X-parts and parts-of-X 
when he should.  I take these omissions to be evidence that Abelard does not have the 
distinction in his conceptual repertoire. 
I also fail to find evidence of the distinction between parts-of-X and X-parts in 
places where Henry claims to find it.  I will offer one example.  At the end of one of his 
extended treatments of part and whole, Abelard reports this curious argument given by 
one of his teachers Roscelin28 (Dial. 554.37-555.9): 
There was, I recall, the view of our master Roscelin which was so unsound as to 
allow that no thing is composed of parts; rather just as [he does for] species, he 
determines parts to be only utterances.29  If someone claimed that this thing, 
                                                 
28 Only one extant treatise has been unanimously attributed to Roscelin, a letter from Roscelin to Abelard, 
which is often remembered more for its colorful insults than for its theological or philosophical material.  
In recent years historians have discovered and attempted to attribute further theological and dialectical 
treatises to Roscelin.  Picavet, following Hauréau, attributed the Sententia de universalibus secundum 
magistrum R. to Roscelin and listed in his appendix of fragments and testimonia (1911, 139-41).  Iwakuma 
tentatively attributes a treatise on Porphyry’s Isagoge (given the title Disputata Porphyrii based on its 
incipit) to Roscelin (Iwakuma 1992a, 74-100).  For the most part these have been tentative or questionable.  
By his own admission the evidence for attributing the Disputata Porphyrii to Roscelin is inconclusive 
(1992, 60).  The attribution of the Sententia to Roscelin has been challenged by Dijs (1990, 89-91).  At the 
end of the day, whether these treatises were from Roscelin’s hand is of no concern to us.  When considering 
Roscelin’s views on mereology, the evidence remains only testimony, often polemical, by other authors. 
29 It is no small matter to figure out what Abelard is imputing to Roscelin.  Roscelin may hold the extreme 
view that parts, like universals, are “puffs of air”, and that all talk about parts and wholes is empty of 
content.  All that exists is individual, and individuals are radically simple.  This is the view offered by 
Victor Cousin (see Mews 1998, 48), and it seems to be Abelard’s interpretation of his old master’s 
doctrine.  In a letter to the Seat of Paris, Abelard accuses his master of holding his vocalist doctrine to the 

 
 
 
45
which is a house, is composed out of other things (e.g. a wall, foundation, [etc.]), 
he contested this [claim] with the following argument: suppose this thing, the 
wall, is a part of that thing, the house.  Since the house is nothing other than this 
wall and roof and foundation, it follows that the wall will be a part of both itself 
and all the others.  But how can the same thing be a part of itself?  In addition, 
every <part> is naturally prior to its whole.  How then can it be said that the wall 
is prior to both itself and to the others, since nothing is ever prior to itself? 
 
Roscelin’s argument, as Abelard reproduces it, is extremely difficult to parse, but these 
two features are clear.  First, Roscelin’s claim that parts are merely utterances, not things, 
is a consequence of a reductio ad absurdum.  Second, Roscelin thinks that he can 
somehow move from the indisputable premise that the wall is a part of {the wall + the 
roof + the floor} to the controversial premise that the wall is a part of the wall.  Once he 
has secured the latter premise, Roscelin easily leads the realist into absurdity.  A part 
cannot be a part of itself, for a part is naturally prior to its whole.  If, for example, the 
wall is part of the wall, then the wall would be prior to itself.  But that is absurd.  
Roscelin thus rejects the initial assumption that parts are things.  We certainly use words 
that we presume to refer to parts.  Therefore, parts exist at least in so far as they play a 
role in a system of utterances.  But if parts are not things, then parts are only found in the 
domain of utterances. 
                                                                                                                                                 
point of absurdity:  “He is a pseudo-dialectician, and likewise a pseudo-Christian, since in his Dialectica he 
concludes that no thing has parts.  Thus, he shamelessly corrupts the holy text: for example, when our Lord 
is said to have eaten a part of a roast fish, [Roscelin] is forced to understand not a part of the thing, but a 
part of the utterance ‘roast fish’.” (Picavet 1911, 129)  However, Abelard is probably distorting his master’s 
thesis for rhetorical effect.  It is possible that by insisting parts are merely utterances Roscelin does not 
deny the existence of substances and even the divisibility of these substances into portions.  Rather, 
Roscelin might be suggesting merely that differentiation and division are determined by the human mind, 
and perhaps even by human convention (Kluge 1976, 410).   

 
 
 
46
So much for the obvious: the difficulty is determining why Roscelin thinks he is 
licensed to move from,  
(A) 
The wall is a part of {the wall + the roof + the floor} 
to 
(B) 
The wall is part of the wall. 
Henry suggests that Roscelin has failed to keep straight the distinction between X-parts 
and parts-of-X (1991, 89).  I do not see how Henry’s distinction explains Roscelin’s 
implicit reasoning.  In particular, I fail to see how Roscelin’s move from the claim that 
the wall is a part of {the wall + the rest} to the assertion that the wall is part of a wall is 
any more justified if it is assumed that the wall is taken as a house-part than it is if the 
wall is a part-of-a-house.  
Henry is also wrong to suggest that Abelard’s response corrects Roscelin’s 
putative equivocation between house-parts and parts-of-houses (Dial. 555.10-19): 
This argument is defused in the following manner: while it is said that the wall is 
a part of itself and of the others, this is conceded [when the parts] are conjoined 
and taken together.  For example, when one says that these three [parts] are the 
house, he does not concede that each of the parts is [the house], only that the parts 
taken together and conjoined [are the house].  Thus it is not true that the wall is 
[the house], nor that any other part [is the house].  Only the three [taken together] 
at once [is the house].  So the wall is a part of itself and the others conjoined 
together at once—that is, [the wall is a part] of the whole house, not per se of 
itself.  Likewise [the wall] is said to be prior to itself and the others when they are 
conjoined together at once, it is not [prior to] itself per se.  The wall exists prior to 
when it was joined [to the other parts], and it is necessary that each part exist 
naturally prior to when it makes the collection into which it is gathered.  
 
Abelard’s critique suggests that Roscelin infers from (A) the further claim: 
(A2) The wall is a part of the wall and the wall is a part of {the foundation + the 
roof}. 
 

 
 
 
47
And from this premise it is a simple step to the key premise: 
 
(B) Therefore the wall is a part of the wall. 
 
If this reconstruction is correct, then the Roscelin’s argument rests on an obvious fallacy.  
The wall is a part of the wall and the others, but only in the sense that the wall is a part of 
the wall conjoined together with the foundation and the roof.  Abelard is absolutely 
correct.  It does not follow from x << {x + y + z} that x << x and x << {y + z}.30  The 
proper part relation is not distributive.  Roscelin’s argument is nothing more than a clever 
sophism.31  But more importantly for our present purposes, Abelard’s critique of Roscelin 
never mentions, nor presupposes the distinction between X-parts and parts-of-X. 
                                                 
30  It will not help to suggest that Roscelin is interpreting the claim that the wall is a part of the wall as the 
wall < the wall (which is true by definition).  The proposed defense is anachronistic.  It is possible that 
Roscelin anticipated the improper part relation.  But the details of Roscelin’s argument suggest that he is 
working within the tradition, not rebelling from it.  Roscelin thinks that if the wall is a part of the wall, then 
the wall is prior to the wall.  But this rule would only hold if he were implicitly translating (B) as the wall 
<< the wall.  In the case of improper parts, the principle is contingent, not necessary.  If x < y, then either x 
<< y or x = y.  If x << y, then the priority principle can hold.  But if x < y because x = y, then the priority 
principle does not hold.  Suppose that the sense of Roscelin’s premises (A) and (B) are, (A*) the wall < 
{the wall + the roof + the floor}, and (B*) the wall < the wall.  It would follow that both premises are true, 
but for different reasons.  (A*) is true because the wall << {the wall + the rest}, but (B*) is true because the 
wall = the wall. But more importantly, in order to generate the reductio ad absurdum Roscelin requires that 
(B*) entail (B**): the wall << the wall.  For it is (possibly) true that, necessarily, if x << y, then x is 
naturally prior to y.  But it is false that, necessarily, if x < y, then x is naturally prior to y.  I fail to see, 
however, why the realist is obligated to assert that (B*) entails (B**). 
31 As things stand, the argument reproduced by Abelard is not sound.  Yet, it is possible that Abelard has 
distorted his master’s doctrine.  In particular, if Mews is correct, Roscelin’s main obsession is with the 
Trinity, and so it might be the case that the original Roscelinian argument is meant to apply to the Trinity, 
not to parts and wholes in general.  To test this hypothesis let us replace Abelard’s example of the house 
and its parts with God and the Trinity The argument still takes the form of a reductio ad absurdum: (1) 
Suppose that the persons of the Trinity are things.  (2) God is composed out of, and is nothing other than 
the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.  (3) The Father is a part of God.  At this point, Roscelin can help 
himself to some Trinitarian doctrine.  According to the orthodox position, each person of the Trinity is 
God, and more importantly, entirely God.  The Father is entirely God, and the Son is entirely God, and the 
Holy Spirit is entirely God.  Thus, Roscelin can help himself to the following identity: (4) The Father is 
God.  By substitution, Roscelin is licensed to infer: (5) The Father is part of the Father.  The Father is, 
therefore, part of Himself, which is absurd.  Roscelin’s reductio is successful.  If one considers the persons 
to be three discrete things, Trinitarian doctrine entails absurd consequences.  The persons of the Trinity 
must be utterances only.  I thank Peter King for suggesting that I reconstruct Roscelin’s argument as an 
argument about the Trinity. 

 
 
 
48
Apart from failing to find places where Abelard (or anyone) utilizes the 
distinction between X-parts and parts-of-X, I want to also present a general critique of 
Henry’s distinction.  I argue that Henry’s distinction fails to do the work that he wants it 
to do.  This is especially true if something is an X-part if and only if it is not a part-of-X.  
Consider a car and its carburetor.  When the carburetor is sitting on the warehouse shelf it 
is a car-part, but not a part-of-a-car.  When it is placed in my car, it becomes a part-of-a-
car.  And when the car is scrapped, the carburetor ceases to be a part-of-a-car, but is 
perhaps still a car-part.  First, we may ask, when the carburetor is in the car, is it not a 
car-part?  If the carburetor in the car is not a car-part, Henry has added something 
mysterious to an otherwise innocuous observation about how we describe the ‘lives’ of 
carburetors and spark plugs.  What is it about the addition of structure that changes the 
status of the carburetor from being a car-part to a part-of-a-car other than the fact that it is 
now in a car?  To claim that a carburetor that is actually incorporated in a car is not also a 
car-part is to suggest that there is not one thing, a carburetor, but rather two things, a 
carburetor-as-car-part and a carburetor-as-part-of-a-car, the former going out of existence 
and the latter coming into existence upon installation.  
Even if Henry thinks that the carburetor that is in the car is both a car-part and a 
part-of-a-car, I fail to see how the distinction is metaphysically illuminating.  Henry’s 
distinction puts a name to a linguistic phenomenon, and perhaps also to a real 
phenomenon.  But it does nothing more.  The distinction does not explain why an X-part 
can exist without its whole, whereas a part-of-X cannot.  If Henry thinks that he is 
pointing to some important, underlying metaphysical phenomenon, his distinction adds 

 
 
 
49
no degree of clarity over and above giving us names to track the change.  If the carburetor 
changes its metaphysical status when incorporated into a car, Henry’s theory only gives 
us a name to give to its different statuses.  If the names refer to two different things, the 
change becomes all the more mysterious, not less so.   
Time and time again, Henry believes he has found someone making use of the 
distinction in medieval treatments of mereology.  But if my general complaint is valid, 
the reader should be extremely skeptical when Henry attributes this distinction to a 
medieval philosopher.  In the next chapter I will explain why the distinction between X-
parts and parts-of-X is not a distinction that twelfth century philosophers will embrace, 
for I will claim that Boethius fails to bequeath the Aristotelian principle of homonomy to 
his early medieval students (3.3.4).  Accordingly, Abelard and Pseudo-Joscelin will not 
avail themselves of a distinction between X-parts and parts-of-X, and in general they will 
tend to concentrate on the ways that a whole depends upon its parts, and not on the ways 
that parts might depend upon their wholes. 
 
2.5: Synchronic and diachronic identity 
The stance someone takes with respect to the existential dependence of a whole 
upon its parts will determine to a great degree how she develops a criterion of identity for 
wholes.32  Developing the identity conditions for wholes requires that we examine wholes 
                                                 
32 The recognition that mereology and identity are intimately related is not new.  We know that there was a 
debate in the Hellenistic schools over whether (i) a whole is different from the part (Epicureans), or (ii) the 
whole is neither different nor the same as the part (Stoics), or (iii) the whole is both different and the same 
as its part (Aenesidemus).  This dispute is recorded in Sextus (Ad. Math. IX.335-337).  For a discussion of 
this passage and the proposed solutions to the dispute see Barnes (1988, 259-268).  Proclus notes that the 
relation being a part of and the relation being a whole for constitute two of four possible relations that 
obtain between beings.  For all things x and y, either (a) x is contained by y (i.e. x is a part of y), or (b) y is 

 
 
 
50
both statically and dynamically, from both the perspective of a single moment in time (or 
atemporally) and from the perspective of two or more moments of time.  I will alternate 
between discussions of the synchronic and diachronic identity of wholes.  But before 
proceeding in this fashion, I must develop some background for the study of diachronic 
identity. 
Everyday experience presents us with evidence that things, both simple and 
complex, exist at more than one time.  We even talk as if they “move through” time.  
Adding the dimension of time invites a host of metaphysical problems concerning the 
nature of time.  In contemporary metaphysics, there are broadly two schools, often 
labeled “presentism” and “eternalism”.33  Presentism is the thesis that only the present 
exists.  The past did exist but no longer does, and the future will exist but does not exist 
yet.  Eternalism holds that each moment of time exists.  There is no ontological privilege 
that the moment currently labeled as ‘now’ or the ‘present’ possesses.  Connected to 
these two theses are two other broad divisions: “perdurantism” and “endurantism”.  
Perdurantism claims that the objects of common sense do not pass though time.  Rather 
my car, for example, is actually a sum of “temporal parts”, or “time-slices”.  My car is 
the sum of, crudely speaking, the-car-at-t1 and the car-at-t2 and so forth.34  Endurantism 
                                                                                                                                                 
contained by x (i.e. x is a whole for y), or (c) x is the same as y, or (d) x is different from y (Elements of 
Theology §66).  Proclus apparently intends this four-fold list to be exhaustive.  If so, then it is curious to 
note that Proclus does not admit the phenomenon of overlap.   
33 For a useful overview consult Loux (1998, 207 ff).  Sometimes the division is drawn between “tensed” 
and “tenseless” theories of time.  Lowe has argued that a tensed theory need not be a version of presentism.  
Lowe argues for a tensed theory of time that does not privilege the present (1999, 95). 
34 This is only a crude way of putting the point, since many defenders of perdurantism, or “four-
dimensionalism”, are wary of the names of temporal parts that look like ‘car-at-tn’.  They worry because 
one of the objections to four-dimensionalism is that, as the names of temporal parts bear out, we can only 

 
 
 
51
claims to capture commonsense.  My car, the endurantist insists, exists “as a whole” at 
every time that it exists.  When I get in my car at t1, I am getting into my car, not a time-
slice of my car. 
The careful reader will observe that perdurantism assumes a modern view of 
space-time, where time is a dimension on a par with the traditional three spatial 
dimensions.  Perdurantism aligns naturally with eternalism (Loux 1998, 209-210).35  One 
point in space does not exist any more than any other point in space.  Likewise, one point 
along the temporal axis will not exist any more than any other.  Often philosophers reject 
perdurantism because they think that there is a crucial disanalogy between the three 
spatial dimensions and the temporal dimension.36 
The ancient and medieval philosophers, and in particular Abelard and his 
contemporaries, assume a version of presentism.  The modern four-dimensionalist 
understanding of time is alien to Aristotelians.  Instead of conceiving of time as either a 
grid on which things are plotted or as a kind of container, Aristotle and his followers 
famously think of time as a measure of change.  Time is something that supervenes upon 
                                                                                                                                                 
understand temporal parts in terms of three-dimensional objects.  In other words, there couldn’t be a car-at-
t1 unless there were a car simpliciter (Lowe 1999, 114-18).    
35 They naturally match up, but they need not do so.  Some contemporary metaphysicians have argued for 
tenseless versions of endurantism, and others for tensed versions of perdurantism (Lowe 1999, 85 footnote 
1). 
36 Roderick Chisholm’s criticism is a particularly succinct version of this mode of attack, “The disanalogy 
may be suggested by saying simply: ‘One and the same thing cannot be in two different places at one and 
the same time.  But one and the same thing can be at two different times in one and the same place.’” 
(1971, 16)  Chisholm acknowledges that this statement of the disanalogy must be made more precise, and 
he attempts to do so.  He also acknowledges that one may appeal to the doctrine of temporal parts to defend 
the view that there is no disanalogy.  But if one does that, then one may not defend the doctrine of temporal 
parts by appealing to the claim that there is no disanalogy between space and time.

substances as they change substantially (e.g. when this matter becomes an animal) or 
accidentally (e.g. when this animal goes from being pale to tanned).  
Presentism historically is tied to endurantism, and in the ancient and early 
medieval periods I can find no exception to this association.  Aristotle’s early interpreters 
betray their endurantist prejudices when they conclude that, while the three spatial 
dimensions are accidents of a substance, they are the closest to substance of all the 
accidents.  If one were to strip all other accidents from a substance, one would still have 
the three dimensional quantity of the substance (see, for example, Porphyry In Cat. 
100.23-28).  In their discussion of the Categories time is not accorded the same special 
status.  Perhaps this was due to the fact that a substance could exist and yet not even have 
the potential to change.37  And if there is no change, time does not exist (for that 
substance).38  The problem of persistence for medieval authors must be framed in terms 
of an underlying assumption that substances can only endure, and that only the present 
moment of time is real. 
With this understanding in place, let us now turn to the synchronic and diachronic 
identity of wholes in relation to their parts.  It turns out that I have already considered the 
puzzle of synchronic identity in several ways.  In section 2.2 we puzzled over whether a 
                                                 
37 A substance need not even have the potential to change, since Aristotle claims that all things that are 
moving or at rest are in time (Physics 221b7-23; 202a4-5).  A thing can only be at rest if it can potentially 
move (Callahan 1968, 69).  While this is a metaphysical possibility, in reality spatially defined (i.e. 
corporeal) substances are always in time.  Time is continuous and uniform because of the unending motion 
of the heavens, and time is one everywhere because all motions are ultimately contained in the one perfect 
motion of the celestial spheres (De Caelo 283b26-284a6; 279a28-30; cf. Callahan 1968, 86-87). 
38 One of the weird consequences of Aristotle’s theory of time is that each substance appears to have its 
own time, a “personal time”.  The reader should consult Peter King’s study for a helpful discussion of 
Abelard’s interpretation of the Aristotelian theory of time as well as Abelard’s attempt to align personal 
times with one overarching time (2004, 100-103).  

 
 
 
53
mereological sum is identical to a more complex whole.  For example, is a house 
identical to the roof + the walls + the foundation?  At first glance, this might sound like 
nothing more than the problem of the many and the one.  But I think that this new 
question embodies a subtly different problem.  It is not strictly a question whether one 
thing is identical to many things, but rather whether two types of whole are identical.  
Thus, another instance of the second puzzle is whether the house is identical to its 
“matter”, whereby I mean, is the house identical to the aggregate {the roof + the walls + 
the foundation}?  In other words, we considered whether the parts that compose a whole 
are identical to that whole.  If the parts are not identical to the whole, then something 
more is required in order for the parts to become the whole.  A common way for the 
medieval authors to fill in this something more is to claim that form plays an important 
role.  Form also helps to determine the identity of wholes in another manner, since the 
problem of identity meshes with the problem of individuation.  
I have already suggested that mereological sums are strictly identical to and 
individuated by their parts.  The sum a + b + c is identical to c + a + b.  Since spatial 
relations play no role, a and b and c can be arranged in any pattern with respect to one 
another.  They can be close to one another, or in three opposite corners of the universe.  
For this reason determining synchronic identity is easily determined.  Two sums are 
identical if and only if they have the same parts.  a + b + c is identical to b + c + a, but a 
+ b is not identical to b + c.   
When we turn to the diachronic identity of mereological sums, we have 
overwhelming reasons to think that a strong form of mereological essentialism holds true.  

 
 
 
54
Given that a mereological sum is individuated solely by the membership of its parts, if 
any part is gained or lost, that sum is destroyed.  Thus, if today I annihilate b, then the 
sum a + b + c no longer exists.  It is just as false that what is now a + c is identical with 
what was a + b + c, as it is false to claim (without reference to any time) that a + c is 
identical to a + b + c.  
Aggregates require more for their individuation and identity.  In particular, for 
aggregates, such as crowds and flocks, spatial proximity is the additional feature that 
must obtain.  When men are sufficiently dispersed, they cease to be a crowd, even if no 
man ceases to exist (and hence, the corresponding mereological sum loses no members).  
This is a compelling reason to think that the mereological sum a + b + c is not identical to 
the aggregate {a + b + c}.  Notice, however, that spatial proximity is all that needs to 
obtain.  If the men in the crowd mill around and talk to one another, it is still the same 
crowd.  Thus, {a + b + c} is identical to {b + c + a}. 
What about the identity of aggregates over time?  Intuitively, we might think that 
crowds can gain and lose members, whereas mereological sums cannot.  So long as there 
are enough men still in the town square, the crowd is still present.  Compelling as this 
intuition may be, if taken as a metaphysical thesis, it seems to entail the existence of 
vague objects.  Just as one might think that there are no precise boundaries to the 
Australian Outback, one might think that there is no set group of men that constitutes the 
crowd.   
Some philosophers are comfortable with vague objects.  But there is another 
option.  Roderick Chisholm is fond of recalling a distinction he finds in Bishop Butler 

 
 
 
55
between a loose and popular sense of identity and a strict philosophical sense of identity 
(1976, 92-104).  In the case of the crowd, loosely speaking the same crowd is present in 
the town square despite the constant flux of its members.  But in the stricter sense 
crowds, like mereological sums, are governed by mereological essentialism.  This crowd 
persists so long as this strictly defined set of members is present in sufficiently close 
proximity.  If Socrates leaves to take dinner with his wife, then this crowd ceases to be, 
even though a crowd is still in the town square.  The common man may well find this 
distinction to be pointless nitpicking.  But what this view sacrifices in naturalness it 
readily gains in metaphysical precision.  Gone are those mysterious vague objects, with 
their equally slippery identity conditions.39  The consequence of this elimination of vague 
aggregates is that aggregates are subject to a strong form of mereological essentialism in 
addition to the criterion that the parts remain in sufficient spatial proximity to one 
another. 
A purely extensional mereology is perfectly comfortable with the synchronic and 
diachronic identity conditions of mereological sums.  It can perhaps also account for the 
added spatial criterion for aggregates.  But one of the reasons that many philosophers are 
suspicious of extensional mereologies is that they are incapable of capturing the identity 
conditions of more complex objects.  For these more complex wholes spatial proximity is 
not enough.  In some cases, the parts need to be attached to one another.  In the case of 
the most complex wholes (which are, incidentally, the most interesting wholes), 
                                                 
39 Defining this heap of stones in terms of its members will not halt the standard Sorites paradox (i.e. the 
paradox of the heap), for the standard Sorites focuses upon our application of the predicate ‘heap’.  While I 
may claim that this collection of stones less one stone is not the same heap, I still up to some vague 
boundary call the collection a heap.  

 
 
 
56
proximity and attachment must also be accompanied by structure, or form.  A house is 
more than just the roof, walls and foundation touching one another.  The parts must be 
arranged in the appropriate way, with the foundation on the bottom, the walls standing 
upright, and the roof attached above.  For some complex wholes, such as human beings, 
structure may not be enough.  A corpse has the right structure, but it lacks the crucial 
feature of being alive.  More abstractly, the corpse does not function (and is not capable 
of functioning) as a human being. 
These additional properties of higher order wholes are appealed to in order to 
claim that a whole is not synchronically identical with its parts.  But now that structures 
and functions have entered the picture, we must examine the relations of dependence that 
obtain between the form and the whole, and we must see how this affects the analysis of 
synchronic and diachronic identity. 
If the form is what individuates a complex whole, then it is possible that this 
whole could have been made from different parts.  For example, one might believe that 
Michelangelo’s David could have been made from a piece of marble other than the one 
that it is actually made from.  But the fact that the form helps individuate the complex 
whole does not entail this claim.  It is prima facie coherent to claim that the individual 
must have this form and this matter to be this very individual.  Indeed, it may even be 
true that a form, while individuating a thing and making it more than the sum of its parts, 
is ontologically dependent upon its parts in such a way that it will pass out of existence if 
the parts are changed or rearranged.  This last view is purportedly held by Abelard’s 
students, the Nominales (4.3.4). 

 
 
 
57
Notice that if the Nominales are correct, then the addition of form will not 
radically alter our account of synchronic identity.  In other words, a whole’s identity will 
still be determined by the parts that it has.  But if form plays a more robust role in the 
complex, so that the whole is something over and above its parts, then the parts may 
begin to play less of a role in determining the synchronic identity of the whole.  The 
precise relation between the form and its material parts, and the role that each plays in the 
static identity and individuation of wholes, will be of primary importance in the following 
chapters. 
The ontological dependence and robustness of a whole’s form will also determine 
how it will function when determining diachronic identity, or persistence.  At one end of 
the spectrum the mereological essentialist claims that in order for a whole to persist, the 
mereological sum that constitutes it at the first time must be identical to the mereological 
sum that constitutes it at the second time.  At the other end of the spectrum, one may 
insist that the persistence of form through a change will suffice for persistence of the 
whole through change.  We will see both Abelard and Pseudo-Joscelin attempting to 
situate themselves somewhere along the continuum between mereological essentialism 
and the view that form guarantees persistence. 
But for the present return to the mereological essentialist’s claim.  This is a 
startling thesis about persistence, for it requires what I will call mereological constancy in 
order for a whole to persist.  This is contrary to many of our ordinary notions about 
complex, structured wholes.  Cars can get a new pair of spark-plugs and remain the same 
car.  Human beings change their matter continuously through various metabolic 

 
 
 
58
processes, and yet they (we think) are the same despite these mereological changes.  Why 
on earth, then, would anyone require that wholes must be mereologically constant? 
One reason that some philosophers take the stronger reading is that it nips certain 
problems in the bud.  Despite our intuition that wholes need not be mereologically 
constant, many of us assume that a whole must be mereologically continuous.  If I were 
to replace every part in my car all at once, I would have good reason to think that there 
was a new car present, not my old car.  This raises several obvious questions: What 
number of parts may I replace at some specific time and yet have the same car?  Are 
some parts more essential to the persistence of my car than others, such that none of these 
parts (or a fewer number of them) can be replaced while preserving the car?  Some 
philosophers, most notably Peter Unger (1979), have attempted to show that there is no 
precise boundary at which parts replaced wholesale cause the destruction of the whole.  
Unger has concluded that this vagueness, when coupled with a version of the sorites 
argument, entails the conclusion that there are no wholes (or at least there are no wholes 
for objects whose constitution is vague).40  Unger tries to short circuit the sorites by 
denying that there are any objects susceptible to the sort of vagueness of composition that 
drives the argument.41  Alternatively, one might dismiss Unger’s extreme claim about the 
                                                 
40 As he puts it, only things that are susceptible to decomposition or not precisely defined fall prey to the 
“sorites of decomposition” (1979, 241-2): “Such things as are not susceptible to decomposition withstand 
this form of argument: certain sub-atomic particles may provide an example.  More importantly, 
decomposable things which are in a relevant way ‘defined with precision’ escape the present reasonings.  
Accordingly, I shall not now deny the existence of most molecules, even some ‘quite large’ ones, nor, 
perhaps, even certain crystal structures.  However, something such as a blue 1968 Chevrolet four-door 
sedan, while according to most accounts not something vaguely described, will fall prey to our sorites.” 
41 Unger introduces three propositions that he holds are mutually incompatible.  (The table stands in for any 
artifacts which is susceptible to the sorites of decomposition.):  (a) There exists at least one table.  (b) For 
anything there may be, if it is a table, then it consists of many atoms, but only a [preciscely specified] finite 

 
 
 
59
non-existence of such objects as tables and organisms and still conclude that there are no 
enduring wholes (or least that there are no interesting enduring wholes).  I could 
eliminate the vagueness of composition by stipulating that this spatially co-located 
collection of parts is Socrates.  But given that normal biological processes almost 
immediately destroy this collection and bring about a new collection, it appears that 
Socrates only exists for one moment.  He does not endure. 
One could challenge the Ungerians in at least two ways.42  One could object to the 
argument because it uses sorites reasoning.  Sorites reasoning is used to generate 
numerous obviously false conclusions from equally obvious premises.  Hence, there must 
be something wrong with the logic of sorites reasoning.   
But in my view, the more promising way to challenge Unger and friends is to 
insist on a greater role for form when developing the identity and persistence conditions 
of common sense objects like cars and human beings.43  This response amounts to a 
switch from what we might call a “bottom-up” analysis to a “top-down” analysis.  Unger 
attempts to determine the identity, and derivatively persistence conditions of a thing by 
enumerating the constituents.  The top-down approach insists that this method is 
                                                                                                                                                 
number.  (c) For anything there may be, if it is a table…then the net removal of one atom, or only a few, in 
a way which is most innocuous and favorable, will not mean the difference as to whether there is a table in 
the situation. (1979, 237-38)  He thinks that the only premise one can legitimately reject from this set of 
three is the proposition that at least one table exists. 
42 Ayer’s curt reply to Unger incorporates both modes of attack (1979, 324).  Ayer’s criticism of the logic 
of the sorites is that it makes use of “the false assumption that the relation of ‘being the same X with one 
less element than on the previous count’ is transitive”. 
43 Unger insists that the functionality of artifacts which, medieval authors will assert, constitutes part of that 
object’s form, has nothing to do with the matter at hand (1979, 241).  But I think Unger errs here by 
considering only a watered down notion of functionality.   

 
 
 
60
misguided.  The form and function of the individual will predominantly determine the 
identity and persistence of the thing, thus allowing for changes of parts, and perhaps even 
a measure of vagueness in composition.   
Abelard has much sympathy for the bottom-uppers, but as I will show in chapter 4 
he must accommodate the need for some top-down analysis when it comes to more 
structurally complex individuals (4.3.3-4).  Pseudo-Joscelin will embrace the top-down, 
form-driven analysis of identity and persistence even more enthusiastically (5.1.2).   
The attractiveness of the top-down approach over the bottom-up approach will 
depend to a large degree on one’s tolerance of forms.  And indeed, forms are in many 
ways mysterious.  They are by definition not material, which already makes some 
metaphysicians uneasy.  There are also worries whether forms count as parts of the 
composite, and if so, are they subject to the same mereological rules that govern material 
parts.  I will consider this question in the next chapter (see especially 3.1.1 and 3.2.3).  I 
will also suggest that forms may either supervene or be independently existing things (see 
4.1.2).  The reader’s queasiness about forms may turn upon whether forms are more the 
former than the latter.  
 
2.6: Conclusion to chapter 2 
I have argued that mereology must ultimately appeal to metaphysics.  
Accordingly, mereology informs, and is informed by, theories of individuality and 
individuation, ontological dependence, and identity.  The meditations above are 
intentionally schematic and open-ended.  I want to give the reader a sense of the terrain, 

 
 
 
61
not an argument for a complete theory of part and whole.  While making use of 
Aristotelian positions, the terrain is by-and-large defined in contemporary terms.  I now 
turn to Boethius and his interpretation of the ancient tradition, and I consider these 
metaphysical problems as he frames them. 

 
 
 
62
CHAPTER 3 
 
 
BOETHIUS AND THE EARLY MEREOLOGICAL TRADITION 
 
 
 
 
No study of twelfth-century mereology is complete without an account of the 
intellectual tradition that these philosophers draw upon.  Specifically, such a study must 
examine the influence of the sixth century scholar and philosopher Boethius.  I will argue 
in this chapter that Boethius’ understanding of mereology determined the way that 
twelfth century philosophers approached metaphysics in general and metaphysical 
mereology in particular.   
Boethius has been described as the “last of the Roman philosophers and the first 
of the scholastic theologians” (Stewart and Rand 1973, xii).  Boethius looks backward to 
the ancients, and in particular to Aristotle and the neoplatonist Porphyry.  But he also 
looks forward, for Boethius appears to foresee the coming of the Western Dark Ages.  
His works, and the works of his contemporary Cassiodorus, appear to be earnest attempts 
to consolidate and preserve ancient learning before it is lost.  Along with several 
independent, introductory treatises, his theological tractates, and his magnum opus The 
Consolation of Philosophy, Boethius aimed to translate all of Plato and Aristotle into 
Latin.  Follwing the lead of the neoplatonist Porphyry, who famously defended the value

 
 
 
63
of studying Aristotle in the platonic schools, Boethius further aimed to show how Plato 
and Aristotle could be reconciled.44  This project was interrupted by his cruel and 
untimely death.  Boethius only managed to complete translations and commentaries on 
Porphyry’s Isagoge, and Aristotle’s Categories and De Interpretatione.  The works that 
did not get rendered into Latin by his hand were, by and large, lost to the West until the 
end of the twelfth century.45  In the absence of Plato, Aristotle was the key source of 
early medieval metaphysics.  In the absence of his Metaphysics, Aristotle’s Categories 
came to embody both a theory of logic and of basic metaphysics.  Porphyry’s Isagoge, 
translated and commented upon by Boethius, was widely understood as an introduction to 
Aristotelian logic, and since logic was preparatory for philosophy in general, to 
Aristotle’s philosophy.46  The metaphysics one could construct from Aristotle’s 
Categories was supplemented by Porphyry’s treatise as well as by Boethius’ 
commentaries on the Isagoge and the Categories.  Some of Boethius’ material on part 
                                                 
44 Tradition credits Porphyry as the chief platonic apologist of Aristotle against the criticisms of his master 
Plotinus.  Thanks to Porphyry, we are told, the study of Aristotle’s opera was once again sanctioned 
(Evangeliou 1985).  In general, Porphyry and his followers spent a great deal of energy reconciling 
Aristotle’s philosophy with the fundamental precepts of Platonism.  Porphyry’s Isagoge is so successful 
that it traditionally is preserved as the first work in the Aristotelian corpus. 
45 There are two notable exceptions.  The early medieval West did possess part of Plato’s Timaeus in Latin 
along with a commentary by Calcidius.  This work, however, was assumed to be a work on physics and 
cosmology.  And while Abelard discusses doctrines found in Calcidius, in particular on the World Soul, the 
Latin Plato does not appear to inform his mereology.  The other main exception is an anonymous 
paraphrase of Aristotle’s Categories known as the Themistian paraphrase or the Categoriae Decem. 
Evidence from manuscripts indicates that the Categoriae Decem was studied and glossed far more 
frequently in the nineth and tenth centuries than Boethius’ translations (see Marenbon 1981). 
46 Determining whether the Isagoge is intended to be an introduction specifically to the Categories need not 
detain us here.  For an overview of the debate, consult Evangeliou (1985).

and whole is presented as commentary upon Aristotle extant works.47  But the majority of 
Boethius’ mereological thought is preserved in his introductory treatments of logic, and 
in particular in his treatise De Divisione (“On Division”).48 
In what follows I will examine the mereological tradition founded by Aristotle 
and presented to the early medieval West by Boethius.  Given the paucity of what was 
available from Aristotle’s extensive opera, it is no surprise that some important concepts 
are not carried over to the early medieval period, or if they do appear, they often do so in 
a distorted form.  Sometimes this omission and distortion is attributable to Boethius. 
Boethius’ logical works are almost without exception introductory treatises.  As one 
would expect from introductory textbooks, Boethius’ treatment of mereology often glides 
over complexities, which a more advanced work would stop to address.  Hence, 
Boethius’ remarks about parts and wholes are often general and devoid of nuance.   
It is by no means clear that Boethius actually has a theory of parts and wholes.  
He might, as some of his contemporary interpreters have urged, be merely parroting 
remarks he finds in elementary, (probably) neoplatonic textbooks without worrying 
                                                 
47 Boethius’ commentaries on Aristotle belong to the neoplatonic tradition of Aristotelian scholarship 
founded by Porphyry.  Indeed there are signs that Boethius is nothing more than an editor and translator of 
Greek commentaries into Latin.  To name one remarkable example, Boethius’ commentary on the 
Categories greatly resembles the extant commentary of Porphyry on the same work.  Indeed, Steven 
Strange uses Boethius’ commentary to elucidate the corrupt and fragmentary text of Porphyry.  For a guide 
to the comparisons consult Strange’s footnotes to his translation of Porphyry (1992, passim.).  Some 
scholars have inferred from this evidence that Boethius’ commentaries are merely cobbled together from 
Greek neoplatonic scholia that were present in his manuscript copies of Aristotle (see Shiel 1958).  Lloyd 
substantially agrees with Shiel’s thesis, and it is because of this thesis that Lloyd feels justified to use 
Boethius as a source for reconstructing Porphyry’s doctrines (1990, 2, footnote 2).  For a more moderate 
and charitable appraisal of Boethius see Barnes (1981, 80).  On the specific problem whether and to what 
extent Boethius’ De Divisione borrows from Porphyry, consult Magee (1998, xxxiv-lvii).  For a more 
general discussion of Boethius’ Platonism consult Gersh (1986, II, chapter 9) and Chenu (1997, 72-79).   
48 Boethius insists that his treatise on division should be read as part of an Aristotelian curriculum, as 
outlined in his (now lost) De ordine Peripateticae disciplinae (877b; Magee 1998, 6.14-16).

whether these remarks are consistent.49  I will not assume that this is the case from the 
start.  Rather, I will attempt as best as I can to re-construct Boethius’ metaphysics of 
mereology.  This reconstruction will require that I piece together stray remarks, think 
through the specific examples that he gives, and generally extrapolate from an admittedly 
sparse collection of rules, examples and hints.  My method carries the risk of yielding not 
Boethius’ theory of parts and wholes, but rather a Boethian theory.  But this is the same 
risk that Abelard, Pseudo-Joscelin, and all the thinkers of the early medieval period took 
when attempting to piece Boethius’ remarks into a coherent metaphysics of mereology.   
 
3.1: Parts, wholes, and division 
In chapter 2 I noted that the terms ‘part’ and ‘whole’ are applied to a wide variety 
of objects.  The neoplatonists and Aristotelians are well aware of this phenomenon.50  
The relation of being a part of something and its corollary, the relation of “containment” 
                                                 
49 Some have argued that Boethius’ De divisione is derived from Porphyry’s lost commentary on the 
Sophist.  Andrew Smith reprints the entire De Div. as 169F in his edition of Porphyry’s fragments.  On his 
reasons for inclusion consult his introduction (Frag. x-xii).  Others suggest that Boethius had two sources, 
one being Porphyry’s commentary and the second being a treatise on division by Andronicus of Rhodes.  
Magee concludes that Porphyry’s prolegomena to his Sophist commentary is the direct source of Boethius’ 
De divisione.  However, he does not discount the possibility that Andronicus is an indirect source, nor does 
he discount the possibility that some of the material in De divisione is original to Boethius (1998, lv-lvii).  
One of the reasons that scholars suspect that Boethius borrows from more than one source is that there are 
problems with Boethius’ presentation of the modes of division (Zachhuber 2000, 88-89). 
50 According to the tradition, Aristotle’s Metaphysics ∆ is a treatise on things with several senses 
(Alexander in Metaph. 344; Kirwan 1993, 122).  Metaphysics ∆.25 and ∆.26 are on ‘part’ and ‘whole’ 
respectively.  (One glaring exception to the rule is Metaphysics ∆.27 on ‘mutilated’, which based on 
Aristotle’s discussion is not a term with several senses.  For a useful discussion of ∆.27 and its place in 
Metaphysics ∆, see Sprague 1990.)  The broader neoplatonic tradition also recognizes this principle insight.  
For example, Plotinus warns his audience that “perhaps it is necessary to grasp more clearly how ‘part’ is 
said” when discussing the parts of the soul, and he immediately points out that the parts of the soul are not 
to be confused with parts of bodies (Enneads IV.iii.2, 11-12).  On the same point, Porphyry recognizes the 
potential for confusion, and for this reason proposes the distinction between ‘part’ and ‘power’ (Frag. 
253F, 29 ff.).

are applied to a variety of items.51  In particular, ancient authors use the part-to-whole 
relation and the relation of containment to characterize the relations between not only 
concrete, material objects, but also abstract objects.  The relations of being a part and 
containment do not stand for the same properties when applied to these different types of 
objects.  This fact becomes most evident when one considers their treatments of the 
science of division. 
 
3.1.1: The science of division 
For the later neoplatonists and Aristotelians mereology is usually presented in 
their treatments of the science of division (diairêsis).52  Treatises on division and its 
correlative process “collection”53 are traditionally considered logical works.  But 
metaphysics and logic as they are understood by contemporary philosophers are rarely, if 
                                                 
51 “To contain”: periechein (Gr.)/continere (Lat.).  The Greek word also means ‘to embrace’ or ‘to 
envelope’ (LSJ s.v. periechô).  Both these meanings are suggestive, since wholes are often described as 
things constructed by gathering together, or collecting other things.  The technical application of the verb 
“to contain” can be traced back to Plato (cf. Parmenides 150a, 151a; and Lloyd 1965, 228).  It seems that 
the following is a truism for the ancients and medievals: x is part of y if and only if y contains x. 
52 Porphyry presents the Tree as part of Aristotelian logic, although there is reason to be skeptical that 
Aristotle himself would embrace the Tree.  The Tree privileges one set of differentia over all others.  
Aristotle, however, seems to acknowledge that one can divide up the same item in different ways by 
applying different sets of differentia, and that there is not necessarily a privileged way of dividing an item.  
It should be clear however, that one need not accept Porphyry’s Tree in order to accept the basics of 
collection and division. 
53 Porphyry and his students use several verbs and their cognates for this process, e.g. sunairein and 
sunagein (Isag. 6, 18-21).  The Greek term analutikê (“analysis”) is found in many of the Greek Church 
Fathers, and also in the ninth century philosopher Eriugena, who is deeply influenced by the Greek patristic 
sources.  

 
 
 
67
ever, cleanly demarcated at this point in the history of philosophy.  For the neoplatonists 
especially, collection and division provides a way to cut nature at its joints.54 
The operation of division itself is divided by the neoplatonists into numerous 
modes.  The catalogues of these modes differ in some respects, from author to author.55  
What follows is Boethius’ division of division (De Div. 877c-d; Magee 1998, 6.19-26; cf. 
Bo. In Isag. II, 154.11 ff.): 
The Substantial divisions (secundum substantiam): 
1. Genus into species. 
2. Whole into parts. 
3. Vox that signifies many things (homônumos phonê) into its significations. 
 
The Accidental divisions (secundum accidens): 
4. Subject into accidents. 
5. Accidents into subjects. 
6. Accidents into accidents.56 
 
                                                 
54 This is a notion that goes back to Plato (cf. Phaedrus 265e-266b), and is carried through to the ninth 
century neoplatonism of John Scottus Eriugena.  Dialectic, Eriugena tells us, is concerned with the 
divisions of the most general genera down to the most specific species, and the collections of these species 
into their genera (Periphyseon I. 463b).  Eriugena equates division with neoplatonic procession, and 
collection with return (II. 526b-c).  Division and collection are not merely logical, the process of division 
“constitutes a universe that is quite real, and the return is equally and in the same way more correctly 
ontological” (Trouillard 1977, 350; cf. Moran 1989, 253).   
55 For a comprehensive catalogue see Magee (1998, xliv-xlviii). 
56 If we compare Boethius’ list of the divisions to several other neoplatonic commentators, we come across 
some interesting differences.  To take only a few examples, David the Armenian lists six modes (154.22-
32):  The first three are (1) Genus into species, (2) Species into individuals, and (3) Whole into parts.  
(Whole into parts is subdivided into, (a) wholes divided into homogeneous parts, and (b) wholes into 
heterogeneous parts.)  The last three modes are (4) Homônumos phonê into its significations, (5) Substance 
into accidents, and (6) Accident into substance.  Elias lists the same six modes (In Isag. 67.26-68.18), and 
adds a further mode:  (7) The division of Being into things from the One and in relation to the One (ta aph’ 
henos kai pros hen) (70.20-21).  This last division is added by Elias to account for the neoplatonic claim 
that everything emanates—and hence comes forth by some mode of division—from the One, or Being (to 
on). 

 
 
 
68
I will put aside the accidental divisions (4-6) and the division of the word into its 
meanings (3), as Boethius’ discussion of these divisions has little to add to our 
understanding of early medieval mereology.  I will also attend to the division of the genus 
into its species (1) only in so far as this division illuminates the crucial mode of 
substantial divisions, that of the whole into its parts (2).   
In his commentary on Cicero’s Topics, Boethius reminds the reader that while 
‘part’ sometimes refers to a species (in relation to its genus), integral parts are never 
called ‘species’ (In Cic. Top. 331.8-9, and 320.42 ff.).  In the same treatise, Boethius 
insists that genera are never called ‘wholes’.  The term ‘whole’ is restricted to singular 
things (In Cic. Top. 331.15-19).  But Boethius, as well as other neoplatonists and 
Aristotelians, sometimes use the term ‘whole’ more liberally to describe anything that is a 
thing-to-be-divided.  The most concise example of this phenomenon is to be found in this 
passage of Porphyry’s Isagoge (Isag. 7.27-8.3): 
The individual is contained (periechetai) under the species, the species under the 
genus.  For the genus is some sort of whole (holon ti), and the individual is a part.  
But the species is both a whole and a part.  It is a part of one [viz. the genus], but a 
whole not of the other, but rather in others (en allois). For [the species] is a whole 
in its parts.57 
 
                                                 
57 Boethius omits the ‘in’ from his translation (In Isag. II., 236.10-11): totum autem non alterius, sed aliis; 
partibus enim totum est. (“However [the species] is a whole not of another, but for others.  For it is a whole 
[in relation] to its parts.”)  According to Busse’s apparatus cricitucs, most of the manuscripts retain the 
‘en’ (Isag. 8 loc. cit.).  However, Pseudo-Elias omits the ‘en’ as well.  So there seems to be a textual 
tradition which supports Boethius’ reading.  This may account for aspects of the interpretation that 
Boethius and Ammonius offer.  (See next note.)   

 
 
 
69
Boethius takes Isag. 7.27 ff. to be summarizing Porphyry’s description of divisions of 
genera and species,58 which this passage from the Isagoge nicely encapsulates (Isag. 
6.16-21): 
Therefore, when descending to the most specific species, it is necessary to go 
[there] by dividing the multitude.  When ascending to the most general genus, it is 
necessary to collect together (sunairein) the multitude into a one.  The species is a 
collection (sunagôgon) of many into one nature, and a still larger [collection] is 
the genus.  But particulars and singulars, to the contrary, always divide the one 
into a multitude. 
 
The language of collection and division naturally suggests the mereological terminology 
of ‘part’, ‘whole’, and ‘containment’.  In his extensive commentaries on the Isagoge, 
Boethius is more than happy to follow Porphyry’s lead and use the term ‘whole’ in the 
more generous sense (In Isag. II, passim).  This tendency to call universals wholes and 
the participants of universals parts is ubiquitous in the early medieval period.59    
                                                 
58 The Alexandrian neoplatonic commentators take Porphyry to be making a terminological point 
(Ammonius In Isag. 91.9-17; Ps-Elias 38.28-31; and Arethas Sch. 65.23-66.15).  Boethius echoes 
Ammonius’ interpretation (In Isag. II, 237.1-11):  “The species is both a whole and a part: a part of the 
genus, a whole in relation to individuals.  And when it is a part, it is made in reference to a singularity, 
when a whole, to a plurality.  For since a genus exists above many species as a one, each part of the genus 
is some one species. Yet, since the species stands over many individuals, it is not a whole in relation to one 
individual, but in relation to many.  Therefore, [the species] is called a whole, because it comprehends and 
conjoins (cohercet) many things.  For when something is a part, it can be itself a one and part of a one.  But 
when it is a whole, it cannot be itself a one and a whole of a one.  Therefore, the species is a part of one 
thing [viz. the genus], but a whole in relation to others.”  The switch from the genitive to ‘in’ plus the 
dative (or just the dative) is due to the fact that when a species is considered to be a whole collected out of 
individuals, it is a whole in relation to many and not merely one.  The dative is the appropriate case to 
express a relation of one to many.  The genitive is used for relations between a unit and another unit.  But if 
Porphyry’s remark were merely about the grammar of relations, it is unclear why Porphyry appears to 
emphasize the distinction.  The last sentence (Isag. 8.3) is introduced by the particle ‘gar’, which is 
regularly used to introduce an explanation.  See LSJ s.v. γάρ.  This suggests that Porphyry means: we say 
that the species is a whole in others because it is a whole in the parts.  If the point were merely 
grammatical, this explanatory sentence is rather unenlightening.  One possible answer, which on occasion I 
find more or less attractive, is that Porphyry’s concluding remark is signaling a transfer from the relation of 
universal-to-universal to the relation of universal-to-singulars.   
59 The other source books for basic logical principles repeat this use of the terms ‘whole’ and ‘part’.  For 
example, when discussing the different senses of ‘definition’, Cassiodorus mentions that the genus is “that 
which embraces many parts”, and that a part is “what lies under a genus” (Institutiones II.3.14).  Isidore

Thus, in one sense, anything that is to be divided is a whole, and any product of a 
division is a part.  In the correlative process of collection anything gathered together (i.e. 
contained) is a part, and the product of this collecting together is a whole.  The process of 
collection is accomplished by locating some common characteristic that binds the parts 
together.  The process of division is carried out by locating a differentiating feature or 
principle, a differentia.  The different types of division take place according to different 
principles of division.  These different principles of division are derived from and 
dependent upon the different types of item that are to be divided.  Consider a few of the 
examples that Boethius offers (De Div. 877c-878a, 888a). 
(a) Of substance, some are corporeal, some are incorporeal. 
(b) Of animal, one is man, another is horse, another is dog, etc. 
(c) Of man, some are dark skinned, some are light skinned, some are 
intermediate. 
(d) Of a house, one thing is a roof, another thing the walls, a third the floor. 
(e) Of this crowd, one is Cicero, another is Plato, and a third is Cato. 
 
In cases (a) through (c), division is a process of categorization or classification.  They are 
logical divisions that are ultimately derived by attending to some property or properties 
of the members of a universal.60  In contrast, consider the division of a material whole 
into its parts, an example of which is case (d).  Here there must be another differentia at 
                                                                                                                                                 
also describes genera as wholes and species as parts (Etymologiae II, xxix, 15-16).  The founder of the 
ninth century Carolingian renaissance Alcuin immediately picks up this terminological convention, as do 
ensuing generations of philosophers (Opera omnia 954b).  
60 Divisions (a) and (b) are cases where the ordering is a classification of substances.  Case (c) is a 
classificatory ordering of a substance (or subject) into accidents.  In the case of accidental divisions, the 
more fine-grained terms do not combine with the more general term to form a definition.  Light-skinned 
man does not pick out a substance—that is, it does not pick out a natural kind.  For the Aristotelian, only 
natural kinds have definitions.  Nonetheless, light-skinned man and dark-skinned man stand in a relation of 
subordination to a less fined-grained term, man.  Likewise, the general term stands over the more fine-
grained terms (as a genus would to its species), and this general term is a ‘part’ of a verbal description that 
answers the question, “What is a light-skinned man?” 

 
 
 
71
work.  The differentiae used to divide integral wholes may not be the same for each 
integral whole.  For example, the principle used to divide the crowd in example (e) might 
not be the same differentia that one employs to divide the house into its heterogeneous 
parts.  Moreover, if the stone and wood that make up the parts of the house are 
themselves parts of the house (as Transitivity would require), then the differentia used to 
divide the house into its homogeneous parts—stone and wood—might be distinct from 
the differentia used to produce the parts in example (d). 
The general schema of division, and especially the necessity of locating a 
differentia, is a common trope in ancient and medieval mereological discussions.  
Boethius, in particular, presents mereological principles almost exclusively in his 
treatments of division and the related subject of “topical differences”.  This fact 
dramatically shapes the way that Boethius categorizes the variety of parts and wholes.  
Even under the heading of the division of the whole, the so-called true wholes, 
there is a bewildering variety of objects.  And it is not often clear why they are all wholes 
(De Div. 887d-888a; Magee 1998, 38.18-27): 
We signify in many ways when we say ‘whole’.  That which is continuous—for 
example, a body or a line or anything of this sort—is a whole.  We say that non-
continuous things are wholes.  For example, a crowd is a whole, and a people is a 
whole, and an army is a whole.  We say that what is universal is a whole—for 
example, Man or Horse—since these are wholes of their parts—i.e. of men and 
horses.  And hence, we call each and every man particular.61  And finally, that 
which is composed out of certain powers (quibusdam virtutibus) is called a whole. 
 
The mode of whole-into-parts contains the following four sub-modes: 
2a. the division of a continuous whole into parts 
                                                 
61 Here I adopt Magee’s emphasis (1998, loc. cit.).  Boethius is highlighting the etymological relationship 
between particular and pars, which mirrors the same relationship between the Greek merikos and meros. 

 
 
 
72
2b. the division of a non-continuous whole into parts 
2c. the division of the universal into parts 
2d. the division of something into its powers 
 
The division of the continuous whole into parts is further sub-divided (De Div. 888a): 
2a1. The integral whole into its heterogeneous parts. 
2a2. The integral whole into its homogeneous parts. 
 
And to this sub-division, we may add Boethius’ example of a man divided into his soul 
and body (De Div. 877c-d). 
2a3. An organism into its soul and body. 
Boethius later mentions the example of a thing being divided into its form and matter 
under the division of a continuous whole.  This suggests that form and matter are also 
parts of individuals.62  I will often refer to form and matter as hylomorphic parts.  
This last observation is already an important feature of Boethius’ treatment of 
division and its implications for mereology. Some interpreters of Aristotle are uneasy 
with calling matter and form ‘parts’, or ‘constituents’.63  Their reasoning in part draws 
upon Aristotle’s insistence that one hylomorphic part, the form, does not behave like an 
integral part.  For the Aristotelian, composite wholes are made out of “elements” 
(stoicheia).  For example, the letters are the elements of the syllable, and the traditional 
four elements ultimately make up organic beings.  The elements comprise the matter of 
                                                 
62 Boethius’ favorite example of a composite substance is a human being, who is composed out of a soul 
and a body.  But he also adds that the substantial form of Humanity is a part of the composite (De Trin. 
2.106-110).  An added complication: Boethius’ remarks about the absolute unity of God—i.e. that He has 
neither parts not accidents—suggest that only substantial forms are parts, not accidental forms (see De Trin. 
2.93-106, and Tractatus II, §1.11-13). 
63 For example, Ackrill argues, “‘Constituent’ is no doubt an unhappy word: it is because matter and form 
are not, in the ordinary sense, constituents that no question arises as to how they combine into a unity” 
(1997: 168-9). 

 
 
 
73
the composite.  The composite is also constituted by the form.  But, the form cannot be 
just another element.  The form is what imposes order and arrangement upon the 
elements.  Ultimately, it explains why this matter is such-and-so.  If, form itself were 
merely another element, one would need to look further for the explanation for why this 
matter and this form are a such-and-so.  In other words, one would be forced to look for a 
further form which explains the unification of this form and this matter.  The same 
question can be posed regarding this further form.  Is it an element or something else?  If 
one again insists that this form is an element, then one must search for a further item 
which explains the composition of the elements.  A regress seems to ensue.  Hence, the 
form cannot be an element (Aristotle Metaph. Z.17, 1041b11 ff.). 
It is still possible to think of both form and matter as parts of the composite 
(Haslanger 1994, 132).  To assert that form is not an element is merely to say that form is 
not a material part of the composite.  Boethius in particular is happy to call matter and 
form both ‘parts’ (De Div. 877c and 888b; cf. Boethius In Cat. 184a-b, and 192c-193a).  
Indeed, in Boethius’ theological treatises, the main “parts” of composite substances that 
he discusses are soul and body, followed by form and matter.  
The divisions that fall under 2a and 2b are divisions of what I will call integral 
wholes.  My use of the this term of art diverges from Boethius in an important respect, 
for Boethius sometimes uses the word Latin word for integral, integrum, to describe other 
types of wholes.  In particular, he sometimes gives examples of integrum wholes which 
are clearly wholes consisting of powers, or what I will call virtual wholes. In his De 
topics differentiis Boethius explains that the “topic from the whole” should be understood 

 
 
 
74
to cover two sorts of ‘whole’, the genus and the “complete thing (integrum)64 made up of 
more than one part” (32.9-10).  Boethius includes abstract items under the class of things 
subject to the topic from the integral whole.  For instance, one of the examples that he 
employs is that of “medicine” (medicina), which has such parts as that which preserves 
health, that which prevents illness, and that which is useful for treating mortal wounds 
(De top. diff. 33.19-20).65  These abstract integral wholes are similar to the virtual whole 
that Boethius spends most time discussing, the soul.  The similarity between the soul and 
medicine will become clear during the course of my discussion of the four differences 
between the division of the genus and the division of the whole (see 3.2.5). 
The fact that the universal is also a whole has caused some confusion for both 
medieval and contemporary interpreters of Boethius.  Some commentators have 
interpreted Boethius’ placement of the division of the universal into individuals under the 
division of a whole, along with his apparent use of extensionalist language when 
describing collection and division, as reason to conclude that Boethius thinks the 
universal is really a mereological sum of individuals.  This confusion needs to be 
eliminated before we turn to examine the four differences between the division of the 
genus and the division of the whole.

metaphysical mereology of material objects, see section 3.3.4 below.

3.1.2: Universal wholes are not integral wholes 
Boethius makes it clear that the part-whole relation that applies to a species and 
its genus is very different from the part-whole relation that applies to an individual and its 
species or genus.  But this principle is in tension with another way of characterizing 
universal wholes, one which suggests that universals are much more like integral wholes 
than first assumed.  At least two contemporary scholars, Richard Cross and Johannes 
Zachhuber, have been misled by the traditional description of a universal as a type of 
whole into thinking that neoplatonists—and in particular, Porphyry and Boethius66—hold 
the position that the universal is a special sort of integral whole.67  As we will see, these 
scholars propose this interpretation of neoplatonic doctrine despite explicit instructions 
from Porphyry and his students that there are crucial differences between universals and 
integral wholes.  Zachhuber mentions that “it was taken for granted in the Academy that 
the relation of the universal and particular was that of a whole and its parts” (2000, 86).  I 
agree.  But Zachhuber immediately proceeds to assert that the universal whole must be 
“an aggregate of individuals”—i.e. that the universal is an integral whole composed of 
individuals.68 
                                                 
66 Both authors assume that Boethius borrows heavily from Porphyry, and hence that he is a source for 
Porphyry’s theory of the universal.   
67 In all fairness, Cross and Zachhuber are only interested in Porphyry as an intellectual antecedent to their 
main subject of concern: whether Gregory of Nyssa accepts a collection theory of the universal.  On this 
issue, and whether any of the Greek Church Fathers held a collection theory, I remain agnostic. 
68 I don’t contest Zachhuber’s claim that in all probability some interpreters of Porphyry inferred that the 
species must be a collective whole.  Cross believes that Gregory of Nyssa interprets Porphyry’s theory as a 
collection theory and that “Gregory’s theory is directed, probably consciously, against Porphyry’s account” 
(2002, 374). 

 
 
 
76
Zachhuber and Cross are tempted to identify the universal with an integral 
whole—in particular a mereological sum of individuals—because of the extensionalist 
language used by Porphyry and Boethius in their discussions of universals.  Consider 
again this passage from Porphyry’s Isagoge (6.16-21): 
Therefore, when descending to the most specific species, it is necessary to go 
[there] by dividing the multitude.  When ascending to the most general genus, it is 
necessary to collect together the multitude into a one.  The species is a collection 
of many into one nature, and a still larger [collection] is the genus.  But 
particulars and singulars, to the contrary, always divide the one into a multitude. 
 
Porphyry’s language of collection suggests that one creates a species by literally 
collecting together individuals into a whole, and that one creates a genus by collecting 
together individuals and species into a whole.  Porphyry adds that a genus and species are 
both sorts of whole, but the genus is “larger” than the species (Isag. 15.13-16).  By this 
he means that the genus “contains” more than the species.  This way of describing the 
difference between a genus and a species has suggested to some interpreters that 
Porphyry is developing an extensionalist understanding of universals, or a primitive 
calculus of classes (Barnes 2003, 148).69  This impression is only reinforced by Isag. 
7.29-8.3 (quoted above in section 3.1.1).  When Porphyry claims that a genus is only a 
whole and an individual is only a part, this implies that the most general genera are only 
wholes, and the individuals are only parts.  Of course, individuals are wholes in another 
sense, but here Porphyry appears to mean that an individual cannot be a class, it can only 
be an element of a class.   
                                                 
69 Barnes concludes that on the balance Porphyry is not an extensionalist, though he alludes to the fact that 
neoplatonists after Porphyry developed an extensionalist theory of genera and species (ibid.).  In my view, 
more research will have to be done to prove Barnes’ thesis about later neoplatonism correct.  

 
 
 
77
It is also easy to find extensionalist language in Boethius.  For instance, 
Zachhuber cites this passage from Boethius’ second commentary on De Interpretatione 
(137.13-18):70 
Hence, it happens that since Platonity applies to one thing, Plato, the hearer’s 
mind relates the word ‘Plato’ to one person and one particular substance.  
However, then one hears ‘man’, [his mind] relates the understanding to the many 
items that it knows to be contained by humanity.71 
 
Zachhuber takes this remark to be a suggestion that the reference of ‘man’ is the 
mereological sum of individual human beings.  Boethius encourages commentators like 
Zachhuber and Cross further by drawing analogies between the universal and discrete 
integral wholes.  Boethius thinks the universal is differentiated into individuals by means 
of the presence of quantity.  This fact is boiled down into his assertion that a whole is 
divided in accord with quantity, whereas a genus is divided in accord with quality (De 
Div. 879b).  This already suggests that the division of the species is made by dividing a 
sum into its parts, a suggestion that is furthered by Boethius’ comparison of the way one 
divides a species to the way that one divides a mereological sum of men (De Div. 888b-c; 
Magee 1998, 40.18-20): 
Likewise those wholes which are not continuous should be divided in the same 
manner as those which are universals.  For example, “of men, some are in Europe, 
some are in Asia, and some are in Africa”. 
 
                                                 
70 Zachhuber also cites as textual evidence Porphyry’s Isagoge (7.27-8.4), his Commentary on the 
‘Categories’ (72.25-27), and Boethius’ On Division (877d).  Zachhuber even ventures, albeit hesitantly, to 
propose that at the time he composed the Categories Aristotle thought that “second substances are wholes 
composed of first substances as their parts” (2000, 85). 
71 Additionally, Zachhuber cites the following selection from Boethius’ second commentary on De 
Interpretatione: “[‘A man is just’ is a particular proposition.]  It takes a part from man, which is universal 
either in word or in nature.”  (partem namque tollit ex homine quod est universale vel vocabulo vel natura) 
(In de Int. II, 140.9-10) 

 
 
 
78
It is only a small step from this comparison to the stronger claim that a species just is a 
mereological sum of individuals, and Cross and Zachhuber are sorely tempted to do just 
that. 
But while this textual evidence is on the face of it impressive, I think that it is 
hardly conclusive.  First, concluding that the universal is an integral whole ignores the 
fact that ancient and medieval authors use ‘part’, ‘whole’, ‘contain’, and ‘collect’ 
equivocally.  It is one thing to claim that the universal “collects” together individuals and 
is “divided” into individuals, and that genera and species are “wholes” and individuals 
are “parts”; it is a still stronger claim to assert that these wholes and parts are integral 
wholes and integral parts.  One need only be reminded that the division of the soul into its 
powers is also located under the same mode.  Yet as I show below (3.2.5), while 
Boethius’ placement of the division of the soul under the division of the whole is not 
without its problems, it is nonetheless clear that Boethius does not consider the soul an 
integral whole composed of its powers.  It does not follow that a universal is an integral 
whole just because its division into individuals is included under the mode of whole into 
part.  It is not enough for Porphyry and Boethius to use mereological terminology to 
describe universals and individuals.  There must be evidence that they thought of 
universals as integral wholes that are composed out of individuals.  This sort of textual 
evidence, I submit, is not forthcoming. 
Both Cross and Zachhuber ignore a crucial complexity in Boethius’ and 
Porphyry’s metaphysics of universals.  Specifically, their metaphysics suggests a three-
fold distinction.  First, there is a difference between the logical species Human Being and 

 
 
 
79
Socrates’ Humanity.  Second, Boethius draws a distinction between the Idea and 
Socrates’ Humanity.  In his On the Trinity, Boethius claims that there are the Forms, and 
there are the forms that combine with matter to constitute composite substances.72  The 
Forms are the true forms.  The forms that combine with matter are rather “images” of the 
true Forms (De Trin. 2.110-117).73  These two distinctions entail a third distinction: that 
there is a difference between the logical species Human Being, which is derived from the 
mind’s examination of enmattered images, and the Platonic Idea Human Being, which is 
a real entity and not a construction of the mind.74  Pace Cross and Zachuber, Boethius 
                                                 
72 Both separate and immanent forms were acceptable to Porphyry and his followers.  When Porphyry 
presents his infamous three questions concerning universals in the Isagoge, the true contrast, several 
influential scholars argues, is between the Platonists/Aristotelians and the Stoics (De Libera 1999, 15-17; 
and Barnes 2003, 38-47).  
73 Compare this with Boethius’ analysis of universals as “likenesses” (similtudines) in his famous 
discussion of the problem of universals (In Isag. II, 166.8 ff.). 
74 Scholastic neoplatonism, as it was developed in Alexandria, formalized this implicit trichotomy into the 
doctrine of the three-fold universal, or “common item” (to koinon).  The locus classicus for the mature 
form of the theory is Simplicius (In Cat. 82.35-83.20).  De Libera hypothesizes that the mature form of the 
multiplication of the universal is the creation of the neoplatonic commentators on Porphyry’s Isagoge 
(1998, LXXIX).  Ammonius provides a clear portrayal of the three-fold universal.  When describing the 
three-fold universal Ammonius begins with an analogy.  “Consider some signet ring which possesses a 
relief of, perhaps, Achilles and many pieces of wax.  Now let this signet ring mark all the wax.  Later on, 
someone comes along, considers these wax pieces and thinks that all of them are from one relief.  He will 
have with him the general pattern (tupon), which is the relief in his thought.  The mark that is in the signet 
ring is said to be before the many, the mark in the wax tablets is in the many, and the mark in the thought of 
the one who has taken on an impression (tou apomaxamenou) is after the many and posterior in 
generation.” (In Isag. 41.13-30)  Ammonius then draws the analogy to the universal (In Isag. 42.6-19).  The 
term ‘universal’ can refer to three items:  (1) The universal before the many (pro tôn pollôn), (2) the 
universal in the many (in tois pollois), and (3) the universal after the many (epi tois pollois).  The universal 
before the many is the divine archetype, the patterns which the Craftsman uses to construct the rest of 
reality.  They are identified with Plato’s separate forms.  The universal in the many is an immanent, 
enmattered form.  This immanent form may be either Plato’s immanent form, Aristotle’s form, or perhaps it 
is meant to capture both (de Libera 1998, LXXX).  Finally, there is the “mental copy” (apomaxeis) formed 
from the mind’s examination of the enmattered forms (Arethas Sch. 10.19-20).  This is the universal after 
the many.  The universal after the many, the neoplatonists argue, is the only true universal, since it is the 
only one of the three that is predicable of many (Elias 29-30; David 117.10-11).  The neoplatonists read 
Porphyry’s Isagoge as a treatise on the third sort of universal, the concept (Ammonius In Isag. 69.2-5).  
Some neoplatonic authors also develop a three-fold distinction of the whole.  The source for this three-fold 
distinction is Proclus (Elements of Theology §§ 67-69).  Alain de Libera contends, pace Lloyd, that Proclus 
never lines up his three-fold analysis of the whole with the three-fold universal, but the similarity between 

 
 
 
80
does not think that the enmattered Humanity in Socrates is a part of the logical species in 
the same sense that a door is part of a house.  The part-to-whole relation between an 
individual and its universal is altogether distinct.  It indicates a hierarchical relation, 
which in turn is a relation of metaphysical dependence.  Individuals only exist because 
the Platonic Idea exists and in turn forms images of itself in matter.   
Both Cross’ and Zachhuber’s interpretations require that we understand the 
Isagoge and the appropriate sections of the De Divisione to be about extramental 
universals.  But the Neoplatonists generally argue that the Isagoge—and the 
Categories—are about concepts (Ammonius In Isag. 69.2-5; and Ps-El. 29.37).75  
Boethius and Porphyry are no exception.  This fact is brought out by Boethius’ and 
Porphyry’s reply to a standard worry generated by Aristotle’s assertion that “primary 
substances”—i.e. individuals—are prior to genera and species (Cat. 2a11-16).  The 
objection assumes that the priority of primary substances to secondary substances is a 
claim about ontological dependence.  But this would violate the commonly shared 
                                                                                                                                                 
Proclus’ three-fold whole and the neoplatonic three-fold universal quickly invited a synthesis of the two 
schemes (de Libera 1999, 19.  Cf. de Libera 1998, LXXXV.).  The most explicit synthesis can be found in 
the Byzantine commentary on Aristotle’s Nicomachean Ethics by Eustratius of Nicea (40.19-41.11).  On 
Eustratius, see Giocarinis (1964) and de Libera (ibid.).    
75 Arethas notes that dialectical science concerns itself with the genus in addition to the many (Sch. 10, 19-
20).  David comments that Porphyry asks dialectical questions, not “theological” (i.e. metaphysical) 
questions (Dav. 120.20-121.2).  Elias says that Porphyry does not concern himself with the deep problems 
concerning the status of universals.  Rather, in the Isagoge, Porphyry addresses the phenomena of (i) x 
being a subject for y and (ii) x being predicated of y (Elias 48.31-49.11).  Two contemporary interpreters, 
Lloyd and Ebbesen, also interpret the Isagoge to be about semantics—i.e. about concepts—and not 
metaphysics (Lloyd 1990, 37 and 44-5; Ebbesen 1990a, passim).  

 
 
 
81
principle that individuals are corruptible, whereas the universal is eternal (Boethius In 
Cat. 183bc):76 
But someone might say: How can individual substances be primary?  For 
everything that is primary removes that which is posterior, when it is taken away.  
Yet when posterior things are removed, the things that are prior do not perish.  
For example, if Man perishes, then Socrates accordingly will also perish.  But if 
Socrates is killed, Man does not thereby perish. 
 
If Boethius and Porphyry held that the species is a collection of individuals, they would 
be committed to asserting that individuals are indeed prior in nature to secondary 
substances.  The whole which we call ‘Human Being’ at the time when Socrates is alive 
is non-identical to the whole labeled ‘Human Being’ which exists after Socrates’ death.  
Thus, if ‘Plato is a human being’ is analyzable as Plato is a part of the whole that is 
labeled ‘Human Being’, the analysis has different truth conditions at different times.  It is 
true that Plato is part of the whole that also contains Socrates, when Socrates is alive.  
But it is false that Plato is part of the whole that also contains Socrates, when Socrates 
ceases to exist.   
Porphyry and Boethius argue that the Platonic objection misses the mark, because 
the objector does not “correctly grasp the nature of individuals” (Boethius In Cat. 183c): 
For, indeed, the total substance of the individuals (cuncta individuorum 
substantia) is not in one [individual], e.g. Socrates, or in any other particular man.  
Genera and species are not understood from one singular thing, rather they are 
conceived from all singular individuals by means of an operation of the mind 
(mentis ratione).  
 
Porphyry makes the point even clearer (In Cat. 90.30-34):77 
                                                 
76 Compare Porphyry In Cat. 90.16-22, and Simplicius In Cat. 82.26-35. 
77 Compare Simplicius In Cat. 84.12-32. 

 
 
 
82
It is necessary to not make the statement (ton logon) about one [individual].  
Rather [it is necessary] to know well that the individual substance is not just one 
of the particulars, but all singular men, out of which the man that is predicated 
commonly is conceived, and [the individual substance is not just one particular 
animal but all] singular animals, through which we conceive the animal which is 
predicated commonly.  
 
Porphyry and Boethius are identifying Aristotle’s secondary substances with concepts 
that have been derived from the perceptions of many individuals.  No one individual, 
primary substance constitutes the essence (or secondary substance) Human Being.  The 
secondary substance is derived from all the individuals.  But this does not mean that 
Human Being just is the collective whole composed out of all the individual human 
beings in the world.  Human Being is derived by an operation of the mind (In Isag. II, 
166.16-18):  
The species should be thought of as nothing other than an act of cognition 
(cogitatio) that is collected from the substantial likeness of individuals who are 
numerically distinct.  And the genus is an act of cognition collected from a 
likeness of species. 
 
Individuals are “prior” to secondary substances, because individuals are the “cause of the 
being” of the secondary substances (Porphyry In Cat. 90.34-91.1).  If no individual 
horses existed, we would not be able to examine the common “likeness” (similitudo) or 
pattern (logos) in all these individuals, abstract that likeness, and produce that which is 
predicable of many—e.g. Human Being.  The species is only causally posterior 
(husterogenê) to the collection of individuals.  The species is not identical to the integral 
collection of human beings. 
Finally, there is one more piece of evidence against the hypothesis that Boethius 
in particular holds a collection theory of the universal.  In his famous series of arguments 

 
 
 
83
against the extra-mental reality of universals, Boethius considers the proposal that “the 
genus and species exist, yet they are multiplex and not numerically one” (In Isag. II, 
162.4-5).  Boethius argues that this hypothesis leads to absurdity, for then “there will be 
no last genus”.  The details of the argument are highly obscure, and admittedly in exactly 
what sense the universal is “multiplex” is open to interpretation (Tweedale 1976, 75-77).  
One plausible interpretation is that Boethius is considering a theory of universals that 
identifies the genus with a collection of individuals.78  If this interpretation is correct, 
then it seems that Porphyry and Boethius cannot hold a collection theory on pain of self-
refutation.  
On balance, then, I think that neither Porphyry, nor Boethius holds a collection 
theory of the universal.  Zachhuber and Cross fail to appreciate the equivocity of 
mereological terminology that is employed in ancient discussions of universals.  The 
textual evidence that they provide is inconclusive at best, and there are strong 
philosophical and interpretive reasons to reject their interpretation.  The collection theory 
of universals, however, does develop in the early middle ages, as I will show in chapter 5 
(5.2.1).  Perhaps these early students of Boethius fall prey to the same misunderstandings 
that motivate Zachhuber and Cross. 
                                                 
78 Peter Abelard interprets Boethius’ remark in this manner.  For more details on Abelard’s attack upon the 
collection theory, see chapter 5 (5.2.2).  

 
 
 
84
3.2: The four-fold distinction between the genus and the whole 
In my view, Boethius does not reduce universals to integral wholes.  This broad 
distinction, however, is not the one which Boethius fixes his attentions upon in the De 
Divisione.  Rather, Boethius is keen to distinguish between the division of the genus into 
its species and the division of the whole into its parts.  Boethius offers four differences 
that mark the division of the genus off from the division of the whole.  First, the genus is 
divided with respect to “quality” whereas the whole is divided with respect to “quantity”.  
Second, the genus is “naturally prior” to its species, while the whole is naturally posterior 
to its parts.  Third, the genus is the matter of its species, yet the parts are the matter of the 
whole.  And fourth, the genus is the “same thing as” its species, while the part is not the 
same thing as the whole.  Each of these differences provides clues for re-constructing 
Boethius’ metaphysics of mereology.  In this section I will briefly touch upon each 
difference.  In section 3.3 I will then try to reconstruct Boethius’ metaphysics of part and 
whole, with an emphasis on the metaphysics of material objects. 
In section 3.1.1 I drew a distinction between integral wholes, virtual wholes and 
universal wholes.  One thing that will become apparent in the proceeding exercise is that 
Boethius’ four rules for distinguishing between the division of the genus and the division 
of the whole work best as a way to distinguish the genus from the integral whole.  They 
are less successful at distinguishing the division of the genus into its species from the 
division of the universal into individuals.79  And they are even more unsuccessful at 
                                                 
79 It is important to recall that the terms ‘genus’ and ‘species’ are relative terms.  The same item can be both 
a genus and a species, depending upon what it is being related to (Isag. 4.14-20 and 5.6-7).  Animal is both 
a species (of Corporeal Substance) and a genus (of Human Being, Horse, etc.).  Only generalissima are 
genera and not species, and only specialissima are species and not genera.  Hence, the true contrast is 

 
 
 
85
distinguishing the division of the genus from the virtual whole.  We will be left to wonder 
why Boethius does not place the division of the universal into individuals under its own 
mode, as some Alexandrian neoplatonists do.80  And we will also wonder why Boethius 
does not think (at least some) virtual wholes are not in fact genera, or sufficiently like 
genera to merit their inclusion under that division. 
 
3.2.1: The genus is divided with respect to quality 
The first distinction between the division of the genus and the division of the 
whole is that the generic division is made with respect to quality, whereas the division of 
the whole is made with respect to quantity (De Div. 879b; Magee 1998,12.17-24): 
The cutting-up of a genus is marked off from the dispersion of a whole [first] 
because the division of a whole is brought about with respect to quantity.  The 
parts that constitute the whole substance are separated either in act or by the 
mind’s power of reason and thought.  But the dispersion of a genus is completed 
by a quality.  When you place man under animal the division was made by a 
quality.  Man is a sort of animal (quale animal) because it is formed by some 
quality.  Accordingly when asked what sort of animal (quale animal) man [is] one 
will respond that [man is] rational or mortal. 
                                                                                                                                                 
between two different relations that a universal may enter into: (1) the relation of a universal to another 
universal, and (2) the relation of a universal to its individual instances.  For convenience, I will sometimes 
refer to the relation of the universal to another universal as the relation between a genus and a species, and 
the relation between a universal and its individuals will be referred to as the relation between a species and 
its individuals. 
80 Elias argues that the lowest species (specialissima) are the “indivisibles” (In Isag. 72.26-73.24; cf. Lloyd 
1965, 220).  The lowest species are still finite parts into which the genus is divisible.  Particulars are 
infinite and indeterminate.  They are infinite because particulars pass in and out of existence.  Particulars 
are also indeterminate in that they are constantly subject to change.  One cannot have a science of the 
infinite and the indeterminate.  The Tree, however, is intended to derive definitions, and thus knowledge 
(epistêmê), of the items on the Tree.  Therefore, Elias and others argue, the Tree must stop at the 
specialissima.  The division of the species into individuals is not a “true” division (Ps-El. 20.15-16).  The 
lowest species are the indivisibles.  Perhaps Boethius took these criticisms to heart and felt that he had to 
eliminate the mode of species-into-individual.  Nevertheless, since the Isagoge and De Divisione are logical 
treatises (and moreover treatises on Aristotelian logic), there is clearly pressure to locate individuals 
somewhere. 

 
 
 
86
One should not mistake the “quality” used here with Aristotle’s accidental category of 
quality.  To be sure, neoplatonic commentators on Aristotle’s Categories often ask after 
the status of the substantial differentia.  Aristotle famously states that the substantial 
differentiae are “said of a subject”, and not “present in a subject”, which is a property 
shared by substances (Cat. 3a21-28).81  Accidents, on the other hand, are present in a 
subject.  Are differentiae then substances?  The neoplatonists thought not, since the 
differentia does not say what (quid) a thing is, but what sort (quale) of thing it is.82  The 
Porphyrian compromise, which Boethius reproduces, is that the substantial differentia is a 
poiotês ousiôdês, or “substantial quality” (Porphyry In Cat. 95.17-33, and Boethius In 
Isag. II, 194.14-15).83  It is not a substance, but unlike an accidental quality, the loss or 
absence of a differentia entails the dissolution or absence of the substance of which it is a 
part (Boethius In Cat. 192b-c).   This compromise is probably at work in Boethius’ 
description of the first difference.   
Whether the compromise solution is a coherent option need not detain us.  What 
is important is the emphasis on distinction between how one divides a genus as opposed 
to how one divides a whole.  The division of the genus is carried out by determining the 
varieties of things belonging to a genus.  From a logical perspective this is carried out by 
                                                 
81 For helpful discussions of the problem, including treatments of Porphyry’s solution to the puzzle, see 
Morrison (1993) and De Haas (1997, 188 ff.). 
82 The differentia answers the question ‘What sort of thing is Human Being?’ (qualis est homo?), rather 
than ‘What is Human Being?’ (quid est homo?).  Nonetheless, the differentia demonstrates the substance, 
or essence, of the species.  It does not merely pick out an accidental feature of Human Being (In Isag. II, 
193.16-194.19). 
83 See Morrison, who calls this solution the “bi-categorial interpretation” (1993, 154-5). 

 
 
 
87
attending to the answers to the question “What sort of animal is it?”  An answer of either 
“rational animal” or “irrational animal” tells us what sort of substance it is.   
Boethius’ language suggests that logical division is grounded in ontological 
composition.  Boethius reminds us that in one sense the genus is a whole, and in another 
sense it is a part (De Div. 887c-d).  It is a whole when logically divided into its species, 
but it is a part of the species in the sense that it is a part of the species’ definition.  For 
some philosophers the definition is an actual enumeration of parts that make up the 
species.  Boethius’ third difference between the division of the genus and the division of 
the whole, that the genus is the “matter” of its species, suggests such a strongly realist 
understanding of the definition.  I will return to consider this point further when we turn 
to the third difference (3.2.3). 
While a strongly realist understanding of the definition of a species is fascinating, 
and entails its own problems, the more troubling aspect of the first difference between the 
division of the genus and the division of the whole is the suggestion that the whole is 
always divided with respect to quantity.  This generalization is troubling for several 
reasons.  First, not every whole is a quantity, let alone divisible into quantities.  The 
universal, for example, is not obviously something with quantity.  A more clear-cut case 
of a whole not divided with respect to quantity is the virtual whole.  In particular, 
Boethius explicitly asserts that the soul is a virtual whole because it is not a whole 
composed of quantitative parts (De Div. 888c-d; Magee 1998, 40.24-27):84 
                                                 
84 Aristotle, Plotinus and Porphyry all argue that the soul does not have parts in the same sense that integral 
wholes have parts.  Consult Aristotle De Anima 411b7-14, Plotinus Enneads IV.iii.2-3, and Porphyry Frag. 
253F respectively.  When Plotinus is worrying about ta merê tês psuchês, this should often be translated as 
a worry about the “parts of Soul”.  In other words, Plotinus worries about how the hypostasis Soul is related 

 
 
 
88
However, it is not the case that soul is a genus of these [sc. the vegetative, the 
animative, and the rational faculties], rather [it is] a whole.  For they are parts of 
soul, not in virtue of quantity, but in virtue of some kind of potency and power (ut 
in aliqua potestate et virtute).  For the substance of soul is composed out of these 
potencies.   
 
The parts of an integral whole form something with a measurable quantity, but the 
powers of the soul, while they “compose the substance” of soul, do not form a 
measurable quantity.  The soul is not a quantity, let alone something divisible with 
respect to quantity.  This first difference, then, does not appear to be a generic difference 
between true wholes and genera. 
Even were we to restrict Boethius’ rule to those wholes that are material, and 
hence can be divided quantitatively, this pronouncement has some odd ramifications.  
Specifically, the rule suggests a striking, and problematic principle for determining when 
something is a part of something else.  If the principle for division is according to 
quantity alone, then it seems that parts are determined solely by a quantitative measure, 
and never by what sort of thing they are.  This would be an embarrassing position to hold, 
for it would seem to exclude things like hands, feet, and heads from being parts, and only 
include things like the top half of the body, or these three inches of the body.  In other 
words, the only parts of wholes are what we called elsewhere “arbitrary undetached 
parts” (2.3).  The vast majority of integral wholes, however, have more than just parts 
                                                                                                                                                 
to individual souls.  He immediately rejects any sense of ‘part’ as it relates to bodies and proceeds to 
consider senses of ‘part’ which pertain to things that are not bodies, and he turns to consider other senses of 
‘part’ that might apply.  Ultimately, Plotinus draws an analogy between Soul and the light of the Sun.  
Sunlight is undivided at its origin, but as it reaches the earth, it dissipates and “divides itself among houses” 
(IV.iii.4, 20-21).  I confess that this final solution is perplexing.  Plotinus himself seems to be aware of the 
fact that he has reached the limits of his power to describe the relation between World Soul and souls.  

 
 
 
89
that have been defined by a quantitative measure.  And indeed, parts that are defined by 
quantity are rarely the things considered when Boethius talks about the parts of things. 
A milder reading of the rule might be that wholes—that is wholes other than 
souls, and maybe universals—are divided into things that have some quantity or other.  
This milder reading would alleviate much of the embarrassment.  Hands, since they are 
material, will have a quantity, even though they are not individuated by the quantity that 
they have.  Sadly, the milder reading of the rule does not naturally conform to the way 
the difference is articulated, which stresses that the determination of the parts of a whole 
is made with respect to quantity, and without consideration of what sort of items the 
products of the division are.  Perhaps Boethius is being sloppy, or overly simplistic for 
the sake of maintaining the introductory character of the De Divisione.  Nevertheless, as 
presented, the rule is unsatisfactory. 
 
3.2.2: The genus is naturally prior 
The second general difference between the division of the genus and the division 
of the whole is that the genus is “naturally prior” to its species, whereas the whole is 
posterior to its parts.  This difference has ramifications for Boethius’ theory concerning 
the dependence of a whole upon its parts.   
The first order of business is developing an understanding of what natural priority 
consists in.  Boethius defines three types of priority in the De Divisione (De Div. 879bc; 
Magee 1998, 12.24-28): 
Again, every genus is naturally prior to its own species, whereas a whole is 
posterior to its parts.  Parts are those things which compose a whole.  Some only 

 
 
 
90
precede the completion of their composite in nature, others also precede in 
account and in time.  Thus, it happens that we separate a genus into posterior 
items, but a whole into prior items. 
 
Boethius distinguishes between three modes of priority: (1) natural priority, (2) priority in 
account (ratione), and (3) priority in time.  I will return to define natural priority in a 
moment.  We can characterize the latter two types of priority as follows: 
An x is prior in account to y if and only if the account of x need not make mention 
of y, but the account of y must make mention of x. 
 
An x is prior in time to y if and only if x precedes y in time. 
 
Temporal priority is fairly straightforward.  Priority in account is best illustrated using 
definitions, for definitions are a primary type of account.  Animal is prior in account to 
Human Being, since the definition of Human Being must make mention of the definition 
of Animal (i.e. Living Substance), whereas Animal need not make reference to the full 
definition of Human Being.  Whatever Boethius thinks natural priority consists in, he 
suggests that it takes precedence over priority in account and temporal priority, and 
perhaps that these two modes of priority are even derivative of natural priority. 
Boethius notes that a genus is always naturally prior to the things into which it is 
divided.  In contrast, a whole is always divided into things that are naturally prior it.  The 
neoplatonic discussions of natural priority sometimes suggest that this relation is a logical 
or conceptual relation.  But at other times, they suggest that the relation is an ontological 
relation, such that if x is naturally prior to y, then y ontologically depends upon x.  If 
indeed natural priority is Boethius’ way of talking about ontological dependence, then 
this is a potentially striking thesis about the dependence of a whole on its parts. 

 
 
 
91
Both ways of construing natural priority are suggested by a passage in Porphyry’s 
commentary on the Categories.  I will quote the first part here (In Cat. 118.24-29):  
There are different kinds of priority and posteriority, as these are said in many 
ways as well.  The mode we are now looking for is this one: we call that prior 
which co-removes (sunanairei) but is not co-removed.  For example, the unit is 
prior to the dyad, for when the unit is removed it removes the dyad, whereas when 
the dyad is removed it does not remove the unit.  Thus, since the unit co-removes 
but is not co-removed, the unit is prior to the dyad. 
 
Porphyry consistently uses the verb “co-remove” (sunanairein)85 to define natural 
priority.  Even though he does not call the priority described in this passage natural 
priority, he uses the same principle in other passages where he does call it natural priority 
(for example, Isag. 15.18).  We can provisionally analyze natural priority as follows: 
An x is naturally prior to y if and only if when x is removed necessarily y is also 
removed, but when y is removed it is possible for x to remain. 
 
Natural priority is also sometimes characterized by “co-introduction” (suneisagein): 
An x is naturally prior to y if and only if when y is introduced, necessarily x is 
introduced, but when x is introduced, y is not necessarily introduced. 
 
These two characterizations of natural priority are generally treated as interchangeable.  
An illustration will perhaps show why they were deemed logically equivalent.  Porphyry 
and Boethius both tell us that the genus is prior to its species, so Animal is naturally prior 
to Human Being.  If Human Being is present Animal is also present, since Animal is part 
of Human Being.  But if Animal is present, it does not follow that Human Being is 
present.  This is usually justified by turning to particulars.  If I tell you that an animal is 
in the room next door, you cannot immediately tell me that a human being is next door.  
                                                 
85 Here I adopt Barnes’ translation of this key term (2003).  Other possible translations suggest too strongly 
a physical removal, though Strange’s choice of “eliminate along with” is also acceptable (1992). 

 
 
 
92
But if I tell you that a man is in the other room, you also know that there is an animal 
next door.  In other words, if I “introduce” an animal, it does not follow that I have 
introduced a human being.  But if I introduce a human being, I have also introduced an 
animal. 
Co-removal can be characterized in terms of essence, or in terms of classes.  
Animal is part of the definition and essence of Human Being.  If I thereby remove 
Animal, Human Being cannot remain, since I have removed part of its essence.  Or, 
considered as classes, since Animal includes Human Being in its extension, if I remove 
Animal I also remove Human Being.  The characterization in terms of classes works 
better at showing the opposite direction of dependence.  If I remove the class consisting 
of all human beings, I have not thereby removed the class of all animals, for that class is 
composed of horses, elephants, tortoises, and so forth.  Put another way, if we were to 
wipe out all Bengal tigers on the Earth, we would not thereby wipe out all animals.  All 
these ways of illustrating co-removal and co-introduction are implied in the neoplatonic 
descriptions of natural priority.  This is not surprising, as natural classes are classes 
gathering together things with like essences, and the relation between classes of human 
beings and animals is also grounded in the metaphysical fact that all animals share a 
common essential feature. 
Characterizing removal in terms of extensional objects such as classes suggests 
that introduction and removal is a physical process.  And since classes are like 
mereological sums in that their parts and members need not be spatially co-located, 
“removal” suggests annihilation.  This suggestion of annihilation is further cemented by 

 
 
 
93
Boethius’ choice of a variety of verbs whose primary sense is “to perish” or “to 
destroy”.86  The language of annihilation in turn suggests that natural priority encodes a 
thesis about ontological dependence.  Returning to our passage in Porphyry’s 
commentary on the Categories, we indeed see the suggestion of ontological dependence 
(In Cat. 118.30-34): 
On the one hand, with respect to removal, the remover is prior to what is not co-
removed.  On the other hand, with respect to existence, when [that] whose 
existence necessitates the existence of something else is in contrast to [that] for 
which it is not necessary that something else exist when it does, that whose being 
necessitates the existence of something else is posterior.87  For example, when the 
dyad exists the unit must exist, but it is not necessary that the dyad exist when the 
unit exists.  Therefore, the dyad is posterior to the unit. 
 
Porphyry then seals the connection between existential posteriority and natural 
posteriority with these concluding remarks (In Cat. 119.1-3): 
Thus, removal is the contrary of existence.  That which co-removes and is not co-
removed is prior.  That which co-introduces and is not co-introduced is 
necessarily posterior.  
 
The rule for introduction is equated with ontological dependence: x co-introduces y and 
is not co-introduced by y if and only if, whenever y exists necessarily x exists, but if x 
exists, it is possible that y does not exist. 
In his treatment of division, which is most influential on later treatments of 
dependence, Boethius follows this Porphyrian practice of giving natural priority an 
                                                 
86 The following are only some of the more common Latin verbs used by Boethius and his followers: 
deperire, deperdere, perire, interire. 
87 As all commentators note, this passage is probably corrupt, even though the sense is clear enough.  For 
my translation I adopt Busse’s suggestion of empalin tou hou ontos for empalin hou ontos.  Strange’s 
translation attempts as best as possible to track the text as it presented (1992, 124).  Barnes’ translation is 
either a paraphrase or based upon an unrevealed emendation (2003, 250). 

 
 
 
94
ontological character.  But there is one passage where Boethius suggests another type of 
dependence is at work in natural priority, namely logical or conceptual dependence.  
Boethius explains the fact that a genus is always prior to its species, with the standard 
remark that it is possible that an animal is, but a human being is not.  Immediately, 
however, Boethius adds the following intriguing remark (In Cat. 289a, my emphases): 
Even if an animal is present because a man is placed there (posito homine), when 
‘animal’ is uttered it is not necessary that there is a man.  Animal is prior to Man.  
The characterization of prior items is this: for those items that are prior, if they are 
removed (sublata) they remove, but if they are introduced (illata) they do not 
introduce.  Thus, if animal is removed it takes away man with it.  But if it is 
introduced—so that it is said that there is an animal—it does not immediately [sc. 
necessarily] introduce man with it. 
 
Co-removal and co-introduction are explicitly tied together.  Boethius’ initial remark 
about the truth-maker of the proposition that an animal is present suggests that natural 
priority is a form of conceptual dependence, not ontological dependence.  Man co-
introduces the concept of Animal, but Animal does not co-introduce the concept of Man.   
Despite this glimpse at a logical interpretation of natural priority, the majority of 
Boethius’ remarks about the natural priority of parts to wholes most naturally support the 
ontological interpretation.  For example, return to Boethius’ discussion of the difference 
between the genus and the whole (De Div. 879c; Magee 1998, 12.27-14.5): 
Thus, it happens that we separate a genus into posterior items, but a whole into 
prior items.  And so it is also true to say that if a genus is eliminated the species 
immediately perishes, whereas if a species is eliminated the genus remains intact 
in its nature and is not destroyed.  The opposite holds for the whole.  If a part of 
the whole perishes the whole, whose one part has been destroyed, will not exist.  
But if the whole perishes, the parts remain, though scattered.  For example, if 
someone removes the roof from a whole house, the whole that was there is gone, 
even though the walls and supports remain put after the whole perishes. 
 

 
 
 
95
Boethius’ ontological understanding of natural priority as it applies to wholes and parts is 
not necessarily inconsistent with the conceptual interpretation.  First, in some sense, the 
concept of Human Being is conceptually dependent upon the concept of Animal because 
there is a metaphysical relationship between the genus Animal and the species Human 
Being.  Second, as I will stress at several points, Boethius’ mereology of universals may 
be developed analogously upon the mereology of physical objects.  The root concept 
behind natural priority could be based upon the paradigm of physical objects, and only 
applied analogously to universals. 
Like the first difference between the genus and the whole, the second difference 
does not appear to be a fully general difference, for the rule that the parts are naturally 
prior to the whole holds for neither the universal whole, nor for the virtual whole.  This 
should be no surprise in the case of the universal whole.  For the species (or genus) co-
removes the individual, while the individual does not co-remove the universal.  If there is 
no human being there is no Socrates.  But it does not follow that if there is no Socrates, 
there is no human being.   
The same thing holds for virtual wholes.  In the De topicis differentiis Boethius 
notes that in the case of such “integral” wholes as medicine the existence of only one part 
suffices for the existence of the whole (33.19-20).  If something cures wounds, medicine 
exists.  But if a thing that cures wounds does not exist, it does not follow that medicine 
does not exist.  In other words, the part does not co-remove the whole, as it should if the 
part is prior to the whole.  One type of virtual whole, the soul, adds a further wrinkle.  
Assuming that Boethius subscribes to Aristotle’s analysis that human souls have all three 

 
 
 
96
faculties, and that animal souls have the vegetative and animative faculties, this much 
follows: the vegetative part co-removes the soul, and it is co-removed by the soul.  But 
the rational and animal parts, while co-removed by soul, are not themselves able to co-
remove soul.  For even if the animal or rational faculty is absent, the vegetative capacity 
may be present: the soul present may be a plant’s soul, or possibly it is the case that 
Socrates has suffered a massive trauma which reduces him functionally to a vegetable.  
Therefore, in the case of virtual wholes either the parts are naturally posterior to the 
whole (e.g. that which heals wounds, and the rational capacity), or they are neither prior 
nor posterior to the whole (e.g. the vegetative capacity). 
As I will show in section 3.3 many Aristotelians will assert as well that some parts 
of integral wholes are also not naturally prior to their wholes.  A simple example will 
suffice here.  Socrates’ heart would appear to both co-remove and be co-removed by 
Socrates.  If the heart is removed, Socrates dies.  But if Socrates dies, the heart ceases to 
possess its individuating function, and therefore it ceases to be a heart.  Thus, even if 
Boethius thinks that the second difference is really only a difference between genera and 
integral wholes, the thesis is still striking.  In section 3.3 I will examine the extent to 
which Boethius thinks that the parts of an integral whole are naturally prior to their 
whole.  But at first glance, his espousal of the rule suggests a version of mereological 
essentialism.  

 
 
 
97
3.2.3: The genus is matter 
The third difference is that genus is the matter of its species, whereas the parts are 
the matter of their whole (De Div. 879c-d; Magee 1998, 14.5-12): 
Again, the genus is the matter for its species, for just as bronze takes on a form 
and transforms into a statue the genus takes on a differentia and transforms into a 
species.  But the plurality of parts is the matter of a whole, while the arrangement 
(compositio) of these parts is the form.  And just as the species is composed out of 
a genus and a differentia, the whole is composed out of its parts.  For this reason 
the whole differs from each and every part because of the arrangement of these 
parts, whereas the species differs from the genus on account of its conjunction to 
the differentia. 
 
Boethius’ assertion that the genus is the matter of its species is often interpreted to mean 
that the relation between a genus and its species is analogous to that between matter and 
form (Magee 1998, 84).  But strictly speaking there is no matter in the species.  The 
analogy is taken from Porphyry, who states that the genus is analogous to matter at 
several points in his Isagoge (11.12-17 and 15.6).  The likeness of genus to matter is 
ultimately derived from Aristotle, who claims that one of the senses of ‘genus’ is as 
matter, “for that to which a differentia or quality belongs, that is the subject, which we 
call matter” (Metaph. ∆.28, 1024b8-9).88 
I have already ruled out the possibility that the universal is an integral whole, and 
hence I think the species is not material in the same way that a statue or Socrates is 
material.  But the analogy to matter suggests that species are actually composed out of 
                                                 
88 On this passage in the Metaphysics consult Grene (1974, 55-56), and Rorty (1974).  Compare Asclepius: 
“The species is said [to be] from the matter of the species (ek tês tou eidous hulês)—e.g. Human Being is 
from Biped.”  (In Metaph. 349.15-16) 

 
 
 
98
parts.89  It just happens that these parts are immaterial, as opposed to material.  I will 
often call the genus and differentia of a species definitional parts.90  In his commentary 
on Cicero Boethius calls definitional parts “substantial parts”, since these parts “describe 
a property and an account (ratio) of a substance” (In Cic. Top. 286.8-9).91  Substantial 
parts play a crucial role in Boethius’ treatment of the Ciceronian topics, since the topic 
from the whole (ex toto) and the topic from the parts (ex partibus) focus by and large 
upon substantial parts, not upon those parts “that embrace a magnitude”—i.e. integral 
parts (ibid.).92   
While Boethius suggests that species are actually composed out of a genus and 
differentiae, he need not subscribe to this view.  The view that the genus and differentiae 
                                                 
89 Cf. Aristotle Metaph. Z.10, 1034b20-22.  Ammonius offers a similar distinction.  Some parts of 
substance are sensible parts; other parts are “noetic” parts.  Noetic parts include the differentia (and 
presumably the genus) of the substance’s definition (they are “from which Man [is]”).  (Ammonius In Cat. 
47.2-13)  At least for the Platonist, the definitional parts are forms (Asclepius In Metaph. 349.16-17).   
90 Compare De Div. 887b-c.  The form (eidos/species), according to Aristotelian tradition, also has parts 
secundum rem.  Unlike definitional parts, these parts do not enter into the definition of the form, but 
nonetheless they do in some sense enter into a complete account of the form (cf. Asclepius In Metaph. 
345.27-29).   According to Aristotle, when giving an account of a composite sensible substance, one must 
(at some point) make mention of the matter.  (This, I take it, is the moral of Z.11, where Aristotle argues 
that purifying form of matter can go too far: 1036b21ff.)  For example, if I were to give a full account of 
human beings, I would mention the fact that they are made up of this sort of matter (i.e. this sort of flesh 
and this sort of bone).  Flesh and Bone then, while not definitional parts of the species Man, are nonetheless 
parts of Man secundum rem.  I cannot detect the existence of parts secundum rem in anywhere in Boethius’ 
treatment of mereology. 
91 Cf. In Cic. Top. 323.26 ff., 285.43 ff., and 290. 
92 Boethius adds the qualification because sometimes the integral parts can play the role of substantial parts 
in a topical inference, especially when the complete enumeration of a thing’s parts can substitute for a 
definition (In Cic. Top. 286.8-15, and 323.46-324.5).  Boethius’ choice example of a case where the 
enumeration of a thing’s parts can play the role of a definition is a house when it is partitioned into its 
walls, door, roof and floor.  Since the enumeration is putatively exhaustive, this enumeration can be used in 
topical inferences from the whole and from the parts.  But see In Cic. Top. 324.26-39, where Boethius 
claims that not every partition of a whole can serve as the basis for a topical inference, even though the 
enumeration of integral parts can at times be used to make an argument. 

 
 
 
99
are components of a species is what I shall call a strongly realist theory of definitional 
parts.  On this realist view, the species is literally a compound form, composed out of 
other forms.  But one need not think of the definition as an enumeration of a thing’s 
actual components.93  One might draw a distinction between parts and aspects, such that 
something can be “mereologically atomic”—that is, indivisible into parts—yet full of 
internal structural complexity.  Scaltsas and others find this view in Plato and Aristotle .94  
One can also find something like this distinction in Epicurean atomism.95  Epicurean 
atoms are indivisible into smaller things, yet since they have magnitude, they have 
“minimal parts”, such as a right and a left half.  One could call these minimal magnitudes 
arbitrary undetached parts and argue that they are not truly parts (see 2.3 above). 
I will not pursue the problem whether Boethius holds a strongly realist theory of 
definitional parts.  I can find no definitive evidence indicating that he is or is not a realist 
about definitional parts, and pursuing this project any further would easily take us beyond 
the scope of the current project.  I suspect, however, that Boethius does not hold a 
strongly realist theory.  My reasons for suspecting that he does not come from what he 
                                                 
93 There are plenty of philosophers who will find talking about the parts of a species to be inoffensive, even 
though it is clear to them that the definitional parts cannot literally compose the species.  Aristotle himself 
seems to be in this camp.  See his discussion of the unity of the definition in Metaph. Z.10-12, and H.6.  
For this interpretation of Aristotle, consult Harte (1996). 
94 Scaltsas tries to draw the distinction this way: some wholes are “mereologically atomic” but nevertheless 
not “simple” (1990, 585).  If a thing is mereologically atomic, it cannot be divided into parts.  Nonetheless, 
this mereologically atomic item may have complexity.  Matter and form add complexity to the substantial 
unity, and they are what they are because of the role that they play in the whole.  But, one cannot cut up 
Socrates into form and matter in the same way that one can cut him up into a head, hands, feet etc. (idem, 
588-89).  Compare Scaltsas’ distinction to Odo of Cambrai’s remarks that universals have “quasi-
composition” (De Pecc. Orig. 1092c-d).  According to Odo universals are simple, incomposite natures 
because they lack material parts.  The human soul is also simple and incomposite, and therefore not an 
integral whole (1100b). 
95 Epicurus Epistle to Herodotus 56-59; Lucretius De rerum natura I. 600 ff. 

 
 
 
100
and Porphyry say about another “whole” with non-material parts, namely the soul.  As I 
have already mentioned, the soul is a whole divided into its powers.  These powers are 
not material, and so the sense in which the soul is constituted by them is difficult to 
determine.  But as I will examine more closely below, Boethius holds the principle that 
objects without parts are indestructible, and therefore immortal.  A soul, or least a human 
soul, is immortal, which suggests that it is mereologically atomic.  Powers are, hence, 
very different from material parts.  They are structural, or better yet, functional features 
of a part-less soul.  If souls have parts only in the sense of powers, it is possible that other 
non-material things have ‘parts’ in the sense that they have powers or features, not in the 
sense that they are literally composed out of them.  Like souls, universals are permanent 
and indestructible members of Boethius’ platonic worldview.  And like souls, I suspect 
that universals are mereologically atomic. 
The compositional implications of the matter-form model are strained in other 
ways by the universal whole and the virtual whole.  Clearly, in neither sense is it literally 
true that the parts are the matter of the whole.  In a looser sense, however, there is a way 
in which the individuals are the matter for their universals.  As I mentioned in section 
3.1.2, Boethius thinks that the universal concept of Human Being is formed by the mind’s 
collection and abstraction of likenesses from individuals.  Thus, in the sense that matter is 
that out of which something is made, the likenesses in individuals are the matter for the 
universal concept.  (Note, nevertheless, that individuals are not matter for the true 
species, the Platonic Idea Human Being.)  Likewise, there is perhaps a sense in which the 
whole soul is said to arise out of its powers.  This is especially true of the vegetative 

 
 
 
101
power, for as I demonstrated just above (3.2.2) this power is a precondition for the 
existence of soul.  Both of these senses of ‘matter’ are even more tendentious and 
metaphorical than the sense in which the genus is the matter of its species. 
Let us turn now to the case of integral wholes.  For integral wholes, Boethius’ 
claim that the parts are the matter of the whole is straightforward enough.  However, 
these two features of Boethius’ discussion are worth noting: First, Boethius introduces 
the equation of form with compositio, which I have translated as “arrangement”.  The 
notion of arrangement will play a critical role in Abelard’s metaphysics of mereology 
(4.3).  Second, Boethius ends his discussion of the third difference with the intriguing 
remark that the whole is different from each and every one of its parts in virtue of this 
arrangement.  His subsequent analogy to the species suggests that this is true because the 
arrangement is another part of the whole.  But Boethius need not, and probably does not 
mean this.  But if the form is not a part, then the suggestion is rather that the whole 
supervenes upon, or perhaps even emerges from, the parts.  Depending upon how strong 
this supervenience is, Boethius may be claiming that the whole is not identical to the sum 
of its parts. 
 
3.2.4: The species is the same thing as its genus 
Finally, Boethius asserts that one difference between genera and wholes is that the 
species is “the same thing as” the genus, but the part is not the same as its whole (De Div. 
879d; Magee 1998, 14.12-15): 
Again, the species is always the same thing as the genus (idem quod genus est)—
e.g. man is the same thing as animal and virtue is the same thing as a 

 
 
 
102
disposition—but the parts are not always the same thing as the whole.  The hand 
is not the same thing as the man, and the wall is not the same thing as the house. 
 
It is not obvious what mode of sameness Boethius is employing when he draws this 
difference between the division of the genus and the division of the whole.  John Magee 
proposes that we understand the x is the same thing as y to mean that x and y share both a 
name and a definition (1998, 85).  In the commentary on Cicero’s Topics, Boethius 
asserts that the species takes the integrum nomen of the genus.  In contrast, the parts 
make up the integral whole and, when conjoined, they take the name of the whole, but 
taken singularly they do not (In Cic. Top. 289.11-16 and 331.10-15).  Human Being is 
called an ‘animal’ and it is Animal—i.e. Corporeal Substance.  However, a hand is 
neither called a ‘human being’, nor is a hand defined as a rational mortal animal.  In 
short, according to Magee, the species “being the same thing as” its genus is to be glossed 
as follows: if x is a universal and y << x, then x is F only if y is F.  But if x is an integral 
whole and y << x, x is F but y is not F.   
As suggestive as Magee’s interpretation is, I think that it cannot be what Boethius 
means for two reasons.  First, if Magee is correct, then it is unclear why the division of 
the universal into its individuals and the division of the virtual whole into powers fall 
under the broader division of the whole.  Just as the species Human Being accepts the 
name and definition of its genus, so too Socrates accepts the name and definition of his 
species.  Socrates is a human being and he is a rational mortal animal.  Boethius also 
admits that the virtual whole behaves like a genus with respect to the predicability of the 
name (De Div. 888c-d; Magee 1998, 40.27-30): 

 
 
 
103
Thus, it is true that this kind of division has a certain likeness to both the division 
of a genus and the division of a whole.  Because the predication of soul follows 
each and every one of its parts,96 it is compared to the division of a genus, [since] 
whenever there is a species of [some genus], the genus itself is a consequent. 
 
If a power is predicated of some X, then Soul is also predicable of X.  Similarly, if a 
species is predicable of X, the genus of that species is also predicable of X.  If something 
is rational, then that thing is also ensouled; just as, if something is a human being, that 
thing is also an animal.  Yet, Boethius is equally adamant that the soul is not a genus (De 
Div. 888d).  Boethius’ reasons for denying that the soul is a genus will be examined 
briefly in the next section (3.2.5). 
Second, this definition of “being the same as” does not discriminate between 
universals in relation to other universals and homogeneous quantities in relation to 
portions of that quantity, for it happens to be the case that the homogeneous parts of 
homogeneous objects take the name and definition of the whole (De Div. 879d; Magee 
1998, 14.15-19):  
This fact is clear enough in the case of those [wholes] which have dissimilar parts, 
but not likewise in the case of those things which have similar parts.  For 
example, in the case of a bronze rod (whose parts are continuous because they are 
of the same bronze) it seems that the parts are the same thing as the whole.  
 
Just as Human Being is the same thing as Animal, so too it seems that the rod section and 
the rod are “the same thing”, for the rod section is said to be ‘bronze’ and the definition 
of the bronze applies equally well to the rod section.   
                                                 
96 Reading quod quaelibet eius pars fuerit animae praedicatio eam sequitur with Magee (1998).  Smith 
prints quod quaelibet pars, cuius fuerit eius animae praedicatio, eam sequitur, which makes Boethius’ 
argument incoherent (Frag. 169F, 646-48). 

 
 
 
104
To be fair, Boethius says explicitly that the part is not always the same thing as its 
whole.  In other words, the apparent counterexamples of Socrates and the rod portion are 
not true counterexamples, since the difference is that a species is necessarily the same 
thing as its genus, whereas the part is possibly not the same thing as its whole.  But if this 
is Boethius’ meaning, why does he mention the case of the bronze rod as if it were a true 
counterexample? 
I propose, then, that Boethius cannot only mean by the claim that “the genus is the 
same thing as its species” that the species takes the name and the definition of the genus.  
This phenomenon is certainly true of species in relation to their genera, but taking the 
name and definition cannot by itself distinguish the genus in relation to its species from 
the universal in relation to its individuals or the homogeneous stuff from its portions.  
Boethius thinks he can resolve the puzzle by pointing out that the rod-parts are not 
the same in quantity as the rod (De Div. 880a; Magee 1998, 14.17-20): 
For example, if you divide a bronze rod with respect to that which is called the 
bronze, it is understood that the parts and the whole are the same.  But this is not 
so.  While perhaps the parts of this sort of object are the same thing with respect 
to substance, they are not the same thing with respect to quantity. 
  
Rod section, which has n quantity of bronze, is not the same as the rod, which has n + m 
quantity of bronze.  Hence, the rod is not the same thing (i.e. quantity of bronze) as the 
rod section.  Boethius thinks this secures the difference between genera and 
homogeneous wholes despite the fact that with respect to what type of stuff each section 
is, each rod section is made of bronze.  Again, the very fact that Boethius feels compelled 
to show why the rod-part is not the same thing as the rod strongly suggests that Magee’s 
interpretation is not correct.  Moreover, Magee’s proposal makes it such that Boethius’ 

 
 
 
105
reply to the counterexample of the rod trades on an equivocation in the sense of ‘same 
thing’.  The rod part is the same thing in the sense that it takes the name and definition of 
the rod, for both things are bronze.  But the rod part is not the same thing as the rod, 
because they differ in quantity.  Boethius fails to face down the challenge to the proposed 
definition of “same things as”.  Rather, he implicitly acknowledges that the definition is 
not sufficient.   
Boethius’ appeal to quantity suggests another interpretation.  To be sure, Boethius 
cannot mean that x is the same thing as y if and only if x is not the same in quantity as y, 
for his examples of virtue and disposition and Man and Animal do not possess quantities 
in any straightforward sense of the term.  Nonetheless, perhaps it is a significant fact that 
Man and Animal both do not possess quantity.  But again we must proceed cautiously.  
Lacking quantity, by itself, will not determine that x and y are the same thing.  Plato’s 
soul and Aristotle’s soul, for example, are both lacking in quantity, since no soul is 
material and possessing matter is a precondition for possessing quantity, or any accident 
for that matter.97  But no Christian, including Boethius, will concede that Plato’s soul is 
the same thing as Aristotle’s soul.98  Quantity may a component feature of the definition 
of being the same thing as something else, but it cannot by itself explain it.   
                                                 
97 In his treatise On the Trinity Boethius notes that Humanity in and of itself is not a subject for accidents 
(2.106-110).  It is only when Humanity inheres in matter that it can become the substrate for other forms 
(i.e. accidents).  In the same treatise, Boethius states that God’s substance admits no diversity, since it 
neither has parts nor accidents (2.93-102, and 104-106).  This is consistent with Porphyry’s remarks in the 
Isagoge which suggest that individuation is due to accidents (Isag. 7.21-27; cf. Boethius In Isag. II, 214.6-
19 and 235.5-236.6).  Accidents can only accrue to individuals in virtue of the fact that they are enmattered.  
It is inconsistent, perhaps, with the bundle theory of individuals, which is sometimes attributed to Porphyry, 
and by association, to Boethius.  See Gracia (1984, 67-81), and compare Barnes (2003, 342-45).  
98 As Chenu notes, it is a commonplace of medieval Latin Platonism that the soul is one, substantial, and 
individual (1997, 62). 

 
 
 
106
Perhaps we can combine the definitional requirement and the quantitative 
requirement into one characterization of being the same thing.  In order for x to be the 
same thing as y, these two requirements must hold: 
(1) x takes the name and definition of y, and 
 
(2) x does not differ in quantity from y. 
 
This characterization would clearly capture the case of the rod and its part.  But condition 
(2) must be clarified to capture the genus and the species.  Neither the genus nor the 
species possesses a quantity, since neither one is a subject for accidents.99  Moreover, the 
manner in which (2) is characterized will not clearly explain why Socrates is not the same 
thing as his species Human Being.  A better formulation, happily, is forthcoming.  The 
most promising characterization of being the same thing is this: 
(1) x takes the name and definition of y, and 
 
(2) x does not possess a material part, which y does possess, or y does not possess 
a material part, which x possesses. 
 
Since matter is the ground for quantity, any difference in quantity will supervene upon a 
failure to mereologically coincide with respect to material parts.  The bronze rod and its 
part both have the name and definition, but the rod-part fails to possess at least one 
                                                 
99 Boethius’ treatment of individuals elsewhere identifies the capacity to possess accidental forms as the 
principle that distinguishes those things which only subsist from those things that are substances (Contr. 
Eut. III.206-220):  “What the Greeks call ousiôsin and ousiousthai we call subsistence and subsisting.  And 
what they call hupostasin and huphistasthai we translate as substance and substanding (substare).  That 
which does not require accidents in order to exist subsists.  But that which provides some sort of substrate 
for other accidents in order that they [sc. the accidents] may exist substands (substat), for it stands under 
these accidents (sub illis stat), in so far as it is a subject for them.  For this reason, genera and species only 
subsist, for accidents do not accrue to them.  But individuals not only subsist, they substand.  They do not 
require accidents to exist.  When they are subjects, they are informed by both proper and specific 
differentiae and they sustain accidents in order that they can exist.”  The species Human Being is not a 
substrate for accidental forms, including quantitative accidents.  Individuals, on the other hand, are 
substrates for accidents, and this is because they are enmattered.  Socrates’ Humanity is enmattered, 
Socrates is capable of being a subject for accidents.  

 
 
 
107
material part that the whole rod possesses.  This new characterization also can deal with 
the alleged problem of Socrates and Human Being.  According to Boethius, the species 
Human Being is per se not a subject for accidents.  It is only when the species inheres in 
matter that the species can be a subject for accidents.  This suggests that Human Being as 
such does not possess any material parts.  Only its “images” in matter, such as Socrates 
and Plato, possess matter as such.  Socrates is a composite of matter and form, and so he 
has a material part.  The species and the individual instance of that species are identical 
with respect to name and definition, but they differ because the instance has a material 
part that the species does not.  The difference between Socrates and his species is similar 
to the difference between the bronze and its portions.  In fact, this similarity between 
homogeneous parts and the parts of universals is highlighted by Boethius in another 
treatise (In Isag. II, 215.8-11):  
For [the species] stands before (praeest) some of its own as if [before] similar 
parts.  For example, if you divide a bronze rod with respect to that which is called 
the bronze, it is understood that the parts and the whole are the same.100 
 
The section of the rod and Socrates are distinguished from the rod and Human Being 
respectively in virtue of a quantity.  The disanalogy is that the rod also possesses a 
quantity, whereas the species does not.  
It is important to stress that the second condition of my proposed characterization 
of being the same thing as something else does not require mereological coincidence.  In 
his commentary on Cicero’s Topica Boethius stresses that while the genus put into 
                                                 
100 Boethius echoes Porphyry’s usage of the term ‘homogeneous’ to describe intelligible substances: “The 
intelligible substance (noera ousia) is homogeneous, with the result that these beings are in the particular 
mind (en tôi merikôi nôi) and in the absolute [Nous].” (Sent. 22)   

 
 
 
108
relation with its species and the species with the genus (ad se invicem referuntur), the two 
are not the same (In Cic. Top. 295.30-32).  The species is composed of not only the 
genus, but also the substantial differentia.  As Boethius puts it, the differentia 
“completes” the substance of the species (320.38-42).  But “it is impossible for 
something to be other (aliud), unless there is a difference in some part” (294.7-8).  In 
these passages, Boethius is talking about the definitional parts of the species—that is, the 
internal structure of the species.  As we noted above, while one of the definitional parts of 
the species is like matter and the others are like forms, the species does not in fact have 
any material parts.  Nonetheless, Boethius suggests here that there is a difference between 
the species and the genus, because there is a difference in parts.  The passages from the 
De Divisione and the commentary on Cicero’s Topica need not conflict, so long as we 
distinguish, as I have, between non-material parts and material parts.  The species and the 
genus are the same thing with respect to their lack of material differentiation, but the 
species and the genus are different with respect to their definitional parts.  In short, there 
are two distinct modes of sameness being employed in these two passages. 
Distinguishing modes of sameness and difference is not alien to Boethius.  In 
other places he distinguishes between three modes of sameness: sameness in genus, 
sameness in species, and sameness in number (see 3.3.3 below).  While none of these 
three modes readily lines up with the two unlabeled, mereological modes I have presently 
described, this fact does not undermine my general point.  In fact, following Boethius’ 
lead both Abelard and Pseudo-Joscelin will also readily develop distinct modes of 
sameness and difference. 

 
 
 
109
3.2.5: Conclusion to the four differences 
Boethius presents the four differences between the division of a genus and the 
division of a whole as if they hold generally for all wholes.  But as my exercise has made 
more than clear, the four differences work best when contrasting a genus with an integral 
whole, although even here there is some strain.  (Recall the observations about quantity 
as a principle of division in section 3.2.1, and the natural priority of a heart to Socrates in 
section 3.2.2.) 
The four differences do not line up well with the contrast between a division of a 
genus into species and a division of the universal into individuals.  I tried to show why 
the universal is not the same thing as its individual, but while I think my proposed 
interpretation is philosophically acceptable, and its accords with many of the texts, it in 
the end remains an educated guess.  If Magee is right, then the contrast with the division 
of a genus into its species disappears.  There is also a sense in which the individuals are 
the ‘matter’ of the universal.  But there is also a sense in which the universal is that out of 
which the composite individual arises.  An individual is a composite of matter and forms.  
One of those forms is the species, or an image of the species.  When one focuses on the 
metaphysics of the individual, the universal begins to behave like a genus, which is a 
(definitional) part in addition to a whole.  The universal is naturally prior to its 
individuals, just as the genus is naturally prior to its species, yet the whole is supposed to 
be posterior to its parts.  The only case where the division of the universal whole lines up 
with the division of the integral whole is with respect to the first difference.  There is a 
sense in which a universal is divided with respect to quantity when divided into its 

 
 
 
110
individuals, since the individuals are all enmattered copies of the universal.  But 
according to Boethius and Porphyry, individuals are also individuated by their accidental 
forms. 
The virtual whole has even less success at lining up with other wholes.  The soul 
is not divided quantitatively.  Rather, it appears to be divided with respect to what sort of 
soul it is, or what sort of power it is displaying.  The powers of the soul are not the matter 
for the soul except in a very tendentious, metaphorical sense.  The powers of the soul fail 
the natural priority test as well.  Indeed, in the case of some powers, the virtual whole is 
naturally prior to the power, just as the genus is naturally prior to the species.  And, 
finally, based upon both my proposed reading of “being the same thing as” and Magee’s 
reading, the soul is more like the genus than like the whole.  The soul and its power do 
not fail to coincide because one or the other possesses a material part.  And if 
predicability of the name and definition determines sameness, by Boethius’ own 
admission, the virtual whole is like the genus, not the integral whole. 
The real puzzle, then, is why Boethius thinks the virtual whole is not a genus.  Or, 
if it is not a true genus, why is the virtual whole not enough like a genus to qualify as 
something which is divided in that manner, and not in the manner of a whole?  With 
respect to three of the four differences the virtual whole resembles the genus more than it 
resembles an integral whole, for which the four differences fit best.  But when we turn to 
Boethius’ favorite example of a virtual whole, we see that he is adamant that it is not a 
genus (De Div. 888d; Magee 1998, 40.30-32): 

 
 
 
111
However, not every soul is composed out of every part, rather different [souls are 
composed out of] different [powers].  For this reason, it is necessary to compare 
the [division of the soul] to the nature of a whole.  
 
Boethius’ reasoning is admittedly obscure.  The passage strongly suggests that Boethius 
is not thinking of Soul, but rather an individual soul.  He reasoning is something like the 
following:  Each soul is a whole, and each has different powers.  But it is not true that for 
each soul, that soul has all the powers and therefore a univocal share of the definition of 
Soul.  Some souls only have the vegetative power.  Other souls have both the vegetative 
power and the perceptive power.  Still others possess the vegetative capacity, the 
perceptive capacity, and rationality.  All three souls are Soul, yet they do not share a 
common definition. 
This reasoning is not very convincing.101  In his commentary on De Divisione 
Abelard proposes that there are actually two definitions of soul, a “superior” one in virtue 
of which the soul “has an affinity with a universal whole”, and an “inferior” definition in 
virtue of which soul has an affinity with an integral whole (In de Div. 194.8-12).  The 
superior definition is that “soul is a quality in virtue of which a body is vivified” (194.13-
14).  The inferior definition of soul is a “quality which is constituted out of rationality 
and out of sensitivity and out of the nutritive capacity (ex vegetabilitate)” (194.18-19).  
The inferior definition of soul cannot be predicated of each of its parts, because the 
                                                 
101 Many of Boethius’ first students were not convinced, and they attempted to locate soul under the 
division of the genus.  To my knowledge, one of the first attempts to place the division of soul under the 
division of the genus is found in a short letter from a mysterious “Master L”, which is preserved in the 
manuscripts of St. Gall.  The letter is transcribed by De Rijk (1963, 75-78).  Because of its provenance, the 
letter is included in Piper’s edition of Notker’s logical works (LI, 9-LVI, 3).  De Rijk’s edition, in my 
judgment, is the superior text.  On a proposed identity of Master L, consult De Rijk (1963, 79-80).  De Rijk 
proposes that the author is Liutbert, an author associated or at least familiar with the school of Eriugena.  
De Rijk’s conjecture, if correct, would date the letter to the middle of the ninth century. 

 
 
 
112
capacity for thinking is not a quality which is constituted out of rationality and out of 
sensitivity and out of the nutritive capacity, nor is the capacity for sensing a quality which 
is constituted out of rationality and out of sensitivity and out of the nutritive capacity.  
Each of these capacities (the rational capacity, the nutritive capacity and the sensitive 
capacity) has its own definition, which sets it apart from the other capacities of the soul 
(194.20-29).  However, the superior definition is predicable of all three types of soul, and 
that is why soul has an affinity with the genus.   
Abelard’s solution is an interesting compromise, but it will not satisfy Boethius.  
First, Abelard’s definition of Soul suggests that it is a quality, and thus not a substance.  
Boethius, however, insists that a soul is a substance (In Cat. 183d-184b).  Moreover, I 
suspect Boethius will insist that Abelard has not found a true genus.  Abelard’s proposed 
definition is so general as to be without content.  The proposed definition is that soul is 
whatever it is that gives life to a body.  But the definition provides us with no definitional 
parts of Soul, no genus under which Soul falls, and no substantial differentia which 
separates Soul off from Not-Soul.  Quick examinations of other virtual wholes suggest 
that this analysis is on the right track.  Consider the virtual whole medicine.  In these 
cases as well the search for a definition yields no results.  If someone where to ask you 
what medicine is, you might answer by enumerating the various parts of medicine.  
Medicine is that art which either heals wounds, prevents illness and injury, wards off 
death, and so forth.  But if one asks for the genus, it appears that one can only come up 
with a relatively uninformative one such as “an art practiced on the body”.  For the 

 
 
 
113
ancients, it seems, characterizing something by enumerating its parts does not amount to 
giving a definition unless these parts can be shown to contain a genus and differentiae. 
Regardless whether the reader finds this explanation compelling, I will let it stand, 
and I will now set the problem of virtual wholes to one side.  Virtual wholes will play a 
relatively insignificant role in my assessment of Abelard’s and Pseudo-Joscelin’s 
metaphysics of mereology.  The bulk of what they have to say about the metaphysics of 
parts and wholes is with respect to integral wholes.  It is, thus, Boethius’ metaphysics of 
integral wholes to which I now turn. 
 
3.3: Boethius’ metaphysics of mereology 
Boethius’ remarks in the De Divisione are often cryptic, and sometimes confused.  
He says some enticing things about parts and wholes.  The challenge is to discover 
whether there is a theory of parts and wholes that is working behind the scenes.  In this 
section, drawing upon the material that I have already examined, I will explore the 
possibility of reconstructing Boethius’ metaphysics of mereology.  Since Abelard and 
Pseudo-Joscelin concentrate upon the metaphysics of integral wholes and their parts, I 
will likewise concentrate upon what metaphysical theory of integral parts and wholes one 
can reconstruct out of Boethius’ remarks. 
 
3.3.1: The problem with quantity 
As my exercise in 3.2.1 should have suggested, a puzzling feature of Boethius’ 
treatment of integral wholes is his insistence that such wholes are characterized by their 

 
 
 
114
quantity.  This characterization has its roots in ancient mereological theories, especially 
Aristotle’s theories.  But Boethius’ suggestion that integral wholes are determined solely 
by quantity is not only philosophically problematic it fails to account for many of the 
nuances in the ancient mereological tradition.  First, for some thinkers it is not the case 
that all quantities are integral wholes.  Integral wholes are a subset of quantities.  Second, 
by focusing on the quantitative aspect of integral wholes and their parts one fails to 
appreciate that many parts of integral wholes are individuated according to principles 
other than quantitative measure.   
Part of the difficulty in characterizing integral wholes is that they differ widely in 
degree of complexity.  Some integral wholes are in fact primarily characterized in terms 
of quantity.  Other integral wholes require more refined principles of division.  
Aristotle tells us that some quantities are “discrete” (diôrismenon), others are 
“continuous” (suneches) (Cat. 4b19).  Boethius echoes this distinction in his treatment of 
the division of the whole, claiming that there are continuous wholes and non-continuous 
wholes (De Div. 887d-888a).  Immediately, we should ask whether wholes and quantities 
are the same.   
The easier case appears to be discrete quantities and discrete integral wholes.  
Discrete quantites are such that there is no common limit, or border, where the parts 
intersect.  Likewise, discrete wholes are such that their parts are spatially separate.  In 
chapter 2 I introduced the two main varieties of discrete wholes: some are merely 
collections, or as I labeled them earlier mereological sums, whereas others are 
aggregates.  Collections are such that the parts may be spatially separate and there may

be no structure imposed upon the collection.  In this sense, any collection of objects can 
constitute an integral whole.  If we gather items together so that they are spatially 
proximate, we get an aggregate.   
From our authors’ perspective, collections and aggregates are characterized by 
being a number of things.  Indeed, as I suggested in the previous chapter, a sum or 
aggregate is essentially some determinate set of objects, and therefore also some 
determinate number of objects.  This is not quite the end of the story, as at least some 
aggregates are also characterized by the type of objects in the set.  A crowd is a group of 
human beings, a flock a set of sheep or birds.  But other than a specification of the type of 
object that can be a member, there is no other requirement set upon aggregates apart from 
spatial proximity and number.  There is no necessary arrangement that the men must take 
up, there are no special roles that any of the members must perform.  A crowd is just a 
group of men who are in relative proximity to one another.   
This lack of structure and the preeminence of quantity in the characterization of 
discrete wholes leads some philosophers to conclude that such sets of objects are only 
quantities, and not wholes.  Aristotle, for instance, insists that mereological sums and 
many aggregates can only admit the term ‘all’ (pan) or ‘all of them’ (panta) (Metaphysics 
1024a1ff.).  When commenting on this passage, Alexander notes that integral collections 
and aggregates are numbers and that number does not properly admit the predication of 
‘whole’.102  One only can predicate ‘all’ or ‘all of them’ of such items (In Metaph. 426.19 
ff.).  A whole has a form, he claims, which causes the whole to become something over 
                                                 
102 Asclepius points out that the Pythagoreans and Plato considered numbers to be wholes—i.e. things that 
stand above (para) the heap of monads that constitute the number (In Metaph. 346.33-36). 

 
 
 
116
and above its parts.  A crowd of men, or even all men, has no such unifying whole.  All 
the men just is the sum of its parts.  Boethius, however, does not repeat this distinction 
between alls and wholes.  Boethius is willing to call crowds of men ‘wholes’.  For 
Boethius, discrete quantities of objects can be non-continuous wholes.  At times, 
Boethius even states that non-substances can be wholes.  For example, times and spaces 
can be wholes containing parts.  Boethius gives the following example: if x always exists, 
then x exists now.  This follows, he claims, from the topic from the whole, which states 
that if the whole is, then the part is.   
Some quantities are continuous quantities, and some wholes are continuous 
wholes.  Continuous quantities, Aristotle tells us, have a common “limit” (horos) at 
which the parts meet (pros hon sunaptei ta moria) (Cat. 5a1-5).103  Boethius never tells 
us as much, but we can easily translate this requirement into one that applies to 
continuous wholes.  For continuous wholes this restriction translates into the fact that 
their parts are not only spatially contiguous, they are attached to one another.  Adapting 
Porphyry’s rule for continuous quantities, we can provide this rule: if W is a continuous 
whole and x is a part of W and y is a part of W, then if x is moved, y is also moved (cf. 
Porphyry In Cat. 102.14-20).   
Aristotelians often describe time and place as continuous quantities.  Time is a 
continuous quantity because it has a common limit, the present.  Place is continuous 
because bodies occupy a place and the parts of bodies occupy sub-regions of that place 
(Cat. 5a6-14).  Hence, one might say that place is derivatively continuous.  Even though 
                                                 
103 Abelard will tweak this criterion and define a continuous whole as that whose parts are placed together 
without any gap.  See chapter 4 (4.1). 

 
 
 
117
time and place are continuous quantities, not all of our authors will be willing to call 
them ‘wholes’.  But we will see that Abelard rejects the notion that times are wholes for 
other reasons, not in virtue of the fact that times are quantities and not substances (4.3.2). 
Despite reservations from Aristotle and others, there is nothing too troubling 
about allowing discrete quantities of objects to be discrete wholes.  But continuous 
quantities present their own difficulties.  First, there is the problem of individuating parts 
of pure continuous quantities.  Second, the vast majority of continuous wholes display a 
degree of complexity that begins to drive a wedge between quantity and the principles 
that determine when something is a part of an integral whole.  In short, some continuous 
wholes are divided according to some other differentia aside from quantity.   
Some continuous wholes have only homogeneous parts, others have both 
homogeneous parts and heterogeneous parts.  Homogeneous materials are materials 
whose parts are “similar to one another and to the whole” (Ammonius In Isag. 81.21).  
Flesh is separated into bits of flesh, blood into more blood.  It is unclear whether a 
quantity of, say, blood or of wax is also a whole.  Aristotle, for instance, is skeptical.  He 
insists that, strictly speaking, many homogeneous quantities are not wholes.  One can 
only predicate ‘all’ of them, not ‘whole’.  For Aristotle, this is because “position” (thesis) 
is an important criterion for being a whole.  If, for some thing, the position of the parts 
can change without changing the nature of the thing, then the thing is an all, not a 
whole.104  Water and other liquids are only ‘all’s (Metaphysics ∆.26, 1024a6-7).  
                                                 
104 Asclepius explains the distinction between ‘all’s and ‘whole’s in an interestingly different manner: a 
whole must be the sort of entity that, if it were to lose a part, the whole would not remain the same thing (In 
Metaph. 346).  The idea seems to be this: If one were to remove a bit of blood, the remaining blood would 
persist as the same thing.  In contrast, if one were to remove a wall from the house, the house would no 

 
 
 
118
Aristotle’s appeal to position also appears to underwrite his refusal to call crowds of men 
wholes, for position implies that some further structure has been imposed upon the 
objects in a set.   
There is another possible reason why continuous quantities of homogeneous 
material are not wholes.  To get homogeneous parts from a homogeneous quantity, one 
needs to use some method of quantification, or measurement.  If one wants to divide a 
pool of water into parts, one must do so by measuring out quantities of water.  For 
example, we might measure out one fluid ounce of water and call this a ‘part’ of the pool.  
But, this fluid ounce of water is not a well defined individual.  Imagine that we now put 
the fluid ounce of water back into the pool.  It would be terribly difficult, if not 
impossible task to re-identify and draw out that very same fluid ounce of water.  In 
contrast, heterogeneous parts are easier to individuate and re-identify.  One can 
individuate heterogeneous parts by means of something other than a quantitative 
measure.  Heterogeneous parts have a form or shape, which helps one individuate the 
parts. 
Both Aristotle’s appeal to position and my independent appeal to the problem of 
individuation rely upon the fact that continuous quantities of homogenous stuff lack the 
appropriate kind of form.  Without a degree of complexity and structure, many 
Aristotelians are hesitant to claim that all quantities are wholes.105 
                                                                                                                                                 
longer be the same.  Of course, we need to specify the sense in which something is no longer the same 
thing, and Asclepius does not offer much help in this passage. 
105 Aristotle claims that the presence of form is what distinguishes a whole from a “heap” (sôros).  While it 
could not exist without the existence of the parts, the whole is claimed to be something over and above its 
parts (para ta moria) (Metaphysics H.6, 1045a9-10).  Asclepius claims that there is something else which 

 
 
 
119
The most complex type of continuous integral whole is analyzable into a further 
set of parts, matter and form.106  I will sometimes refer to matter and form as 
hylomorphic parts.  The introduction of a formal component seriously strains the 
quantitative analysis of integral wholes.  While it is true that hands, heads, and feet have 
some quantity or another, it is not in virtue of their quantity that these parts are produced 
by some division.  The form, either of the individual or the part itself, now plays the 
dominant role as the principle of division.   
The presence of form explains why Aristotle says that there are some entities 
which admit both the predication of ‘whole’ and ‘all’, for example wax.  The wax admits 
both predications because they possess both the characteristic features of ‘all’s and of 
‘whole’s (1024a6).  Wax is a paradigmatic example of homogeneous stuff.  Each part of 
the wax is wax.  Considered qua wax, a change in the position of parts does not change 
the nature of the wax.  Hence, it is an ‘all’.  But, wax also possesses a shape of some sort, 
even though qua wax the shape is not essential.  Suppose that the wax possesses the 
shape of a man.  One can then individuate parts of the man-shaped-wax, for example the  
                                                                                                                                                 
“supervenes” (epiginetai) and makes the whole subsist as something over and above (para) its parts.  
Nevertheless, this supervening element is dependent upon the existence of the parts and the collecting 
together of these parts (In Metaph. 346.16-22; cf. 350.21-22). 
106 Continuous integral wholes which have a form can differ also in degree of unity.  Artifacts, such as 
chairs and desks, have parts that are attached in a relatively weak manner—for example, with nails or glue.  
Such constructed wholes are less unified than other continuous wholes, namely organic wholes (Aristotle 
Metaphysics ∆.26, 1023b34-36; cf. idem. I.1, 1052a19ff.).  Of continuous wholes, organic wholes are the 
most unified, and hence most properly called ‘wholes’. 

 
 
 
120
arm-shaped-wax, and if one were to move the arm-shaped-wax from its initial position 
and grafted it on to another location, the shape of the wax would change.  Hence, the wax 
qua shaped wax can be called a ‘whole’. 
I suggested in section 3.2.3 that Boethius acknowledges the role of form.  The 
parts, he explains, are the matter, which with the aid of the form creates the whole.  His 
example, recall, was a hunk of bronze, which when the form of Zeus is imposed on it 
becomes the statue of Zeus.  We also noted above that the form may be a part, or it may 
be something else.  Boethius’ description of the statue in the De Divisione is ambiguous 
on this point.  He claims that a thing can be divided into its parts, or into matter and form.  
Perhaps he means that the form is not a part of the statue.  On the other hand, perhaps he 
means that the statue can be divided into its material parts, or into its hylomorphic parts.   
But if Boethius thinks both divisions are exhaustive, then where did the form go 
when the statue is divided into its material parts?  Anticipating developments in the 
twelfth century, we might say that forms are either robust or supervenient.  A robust form 
is one that, regardless of its status as a part, is something that can exist independently of 
the material parts that it structures.  A supervenient form is one which depends upon its 
material parts for its existence.   There are degrees of dependence and independence.  A 
form may depend on the existence of some parts, but not all.  Or it may depend upon the 
existence of a select set of parts.  For example, the form of the house may depend upon 
the existence of the walls, roof, and foundation, but not upon the window panes, or 
doorknobs.   

 
 
 
121
Boethius’ discussion of the divisions of the statue leaves room for the view that 
forms of at least some things are supervenient.  Other forms, in particular substantial 
forms, are probably more robust.  But Boethius does not tell us enough about forms to 
confirm this proposal with a great degree of certainty.  In his theological treatises he tells 
us that, on the one hand, there are the divine, simple, and indestructible Ideas, and on the 
other hand, there are the “images” of these Ideas, which are created in matter.  Clearly the 
Ideas are at the robust extreme of the spectrum just developed.  The status of the images 
is left underdetermined.  If I were to guess, I would bet that the substantial forms of 
things are more robust than supervenient.  Boethius’ silence about these matters will 
hinder my attempt to isolate and develop Boethius’ theory of persistence with respect to 
changes in parts. 
 
3.3.2: On when something is a part of an integral whole 
As I mentioned in chapter 2, one of the tasks for the metaphysics of mereology is 
to determine what things count as parts of another thing or when some thing is a part of 
another thing (2.3).  Boethius gives us a few clues about how parts are determined, but 
what he says is not entirely conclusive. 
Boethius sometimes suggests that a part is that thing which goes into the 
composition of the whole (De top. diff. 50.18-19): 
Parts are those things which when brought together make up the whole. 
 
Boethius contrasts parts with another sort of ‘part’ (50.19-20): 
And those things that divide the whole are called parts.  These, however, are 
usually called species or forms. 

 
 
 
122
This description suggests that integral parts are never determined by division, they are 
only determined by attending to composition.  But this thesis is in stark contrast with 
Boethius’ insistence in De Divisione that integral parts are products of divisions, just as 
much as other products of division can be parts.  Indeed, he claims that one can get 
several different sets of parts of continuous wholes by dividing them into either 
homogeneous parts, such as flesh and bone, or into heterogenous parts, such as hands and 
feet. 
Boethius’ characterizations of parts need not be contradictory if they are allowed 
to be sufficient but not necessary conditions for parthood.  The things that make up a 
whole are in one sense parts of the whole, whereas the products of dividing a whole are 
also in a sense parts. 
The apparent contradiction also dissipates if one remembers that “division” is 
often conceived as analysis and not just literal separation.  Boethius acknowledges that 
some divisions of a whole are not actual separations, since the products of the division 
are not items that can actually be pried away from each other (De Div. 888b; Magee 
1998, 40.11-15): 
It is crucial that one not think that everything is divided in actuality, as some are 
divided in the mind and in account (ratione).  For example, in actuality we can 
divide a mixture of water and wine into [smaller] mixtures of water and wine.  
But should we divide [the mixture] into its components, one being water and the 
other wine, this [is a division made only] in account.  Now that they are mixed, 
they cannot be [actually] separated. 
 
Boethius immediately follows the example of the wine-water mixture with the 
observation that a whole can be divided both into its “parts”—by which he probably 
means, into its quantitative parts—and into matter and form (ibid.; Magee 1998, 40.15-

 
 
 
123
17).  In different respects, the parts and the matter and form of a thing both compose the 
thing.  The inclusion of the example of form and matter might not be an afterthought, 
since in his theological works, Boethius stresses that the forms of material things are 
never actually separable from their matter (De Trin. 2.110-117, and 2.69-71).  Both the 
division of the wine-water mixture and the division of a statue into matter and shape, or 
form, are divisions in account.  Divisions of this sort are analyses of the make-up or 
formula (ratio) of a thing. 
Thus, some parts of an integral whole are products of physical division.  
Examples of physically divided parts are those divided solely according to quantity, or 
spatial parts.  Some heterogeneous parts are perhaps also physically separable, although it 
is less clear that they are defined by their actual separability.  Indeed, their actual 
separation might entail the cessation of their existence (see 2.4.3).  Boethius to my 
knowledge never repeats Aristotle’s maxim, but he might agree that a hand once 
separated from the body ceases to be a hand.  Other parts are determined by the fact that 
they make the whole.  The elements in the formula of a whole might be actually 
separable, as the door, walls, and roof are separable from the house.  But sometimes the 
parts will not be separable in act.  
However, this liberality concerning what counts as a part is tempered by 
Boethius’ suggestion that there are privileged divisions.  This in turn implies that some 
parts are the privileged parts. 
In his treatment of Cicero’s Topics, Boethius introduces the term “membrum”—
literally ‘limb’—to denote an integral part (In Cic. Top. 289.14-16 and 286.14-15).  The 

 
 
 
124
use of this term suggests that the integral parts that topical inferences fix upon are the 
heterogeneous integral parts of a thing.  And again, Boethius’ examples seem to bear this 
out.  One substitutes an enumeration of members for a proper definition by enumerating 
the distinguishable parts of a thing—e.g. its walls and roof, or its head and hands.  Thus, 
it is possible that not all integral parts are membra; only those parts that have a degree of 
structure can qualify as membra.  This last suggestion, however, is only a conjecture.  
Boethius does not explicitly define membra in such terms. 
Suppose Boethius is referring to heterogenous parts alone with his term 
‘membra’.  This fixation on heterogeneous parts would be a natural consequence of his 
principle that the partition of a whole should begin with the greatest parts and then move 
to the parts of these parts (In Cic. Top. 334.21-26).  The implicit reasoning in the 
commentary on Cicero is that the greater parts are easier to understand.107  Since one 
wants to build logically sound arguments from the definitions and divisions of items, it is 
best to start on as firm a footing as one can when analyzing an items parts. 
Boethius does not mean that we should necessarily start with the parts largest in 
size.  For the initial division of a house is not into two halves, but rather into discrete, 
function-specific parts (De Div. 888a; Magee 1998, 38.29-40.3): 
If [a whole] is continuous, [the division should be made] into those parts out of 
which this whole is perceived to consist.  Otherwise, it is not a division.  For you 
should divide a human body into its parts, into a head, hands, chest, and feet, or in 
                                                 
107 Boethius notes that some wholes have parts that are few in number and readily intelligible; others have 
many parts or ones that are difficult to understand (In Cic. Top. 334.15-17).  For this reason, it is excusable 
if one makes an error enumerating the parts of a complex object, whereas there is no excuse for failing to 
properly divide a simpler object.  Apparently bodies are subject to more error, since they have an indefinite 
(infinita) number of parts (334.30).  Yet genera and species are finitely divisible.  This means that they are 
more intelligible, and that it is far less excusable to fail to properly divide them. 

 
 
 
125
some other manner if a correct division comes to be with respect to appropriate 
parts (et si quo alio modo secundum proprias partes fit recta divisio). 
 
This passage from the De Divisione claims that divisions with respect to heterogeneous, 
function-specific parts are easier, but as the last sentence makes clear, the division of a 
whole into function specific parts is one of potentially several privileged divisions.  This 
thought is immediately confirmed (De Div. 888a-b; Magee 1998, 40.3-7): 
Of those things whose composition is many-fold (multiplex), division is many-
fold.  For example, an animal is separated into those parts which have parts 
similar to itself [i.e. homogeneous parts]—i.e. into flesh and bones—and, again, 
[an animal] is separable into those [parts] which do not have parts similar to 
itself—i.e. into hands, feet, [etc.].  In a similar manner [one can divide up] a ship 
or a house. 
 
Whatever mode of division we choose, we nonetheless start with the function-specific 
parts.  Up to this point, Boethius does not seem to countenance a division that begins by 
dividing up organs and which then divides the organs into homogeneous parts.  But in the 
remarks that immediately follow, Boethius suggests that there are parts of the whole, and 
there are parts of the parts (De Div. 888b; Magee 1998, 40.7-11): 
We resolve a book into verses, and these [verses] into words, [the words] into 
syllables, and syllables into letters.  Thus, it is the case that it appears that the 
letters, syllables, names and verses are in some sense (quaedam) parts of the 
whole book.  Nevertheless, when taken in another manner, they are not parts of 
the whole, rather they are parts of parts.108 
 
Boethius may intend for us to draw a general moral from the verse to syllable example, as 
some later commentators did (Magee 1998, 149).  It may be that we are to divide a body 
first into heterogenous parts, then these heterogeneous parts into their homogeneous 
                                                 
108 This idea is found in several late ancient handbooks on logic.  Compare, for instance, Isidore of Seville: 
“You divide a statement into the word, and the word into syllables, and the syllable into letters.  The letter, 
the smallest part, is an atom, and it cannot be divided.” (Etymologiae XIII, ii, 4) 

 
 
 
126
elements.  If so, it may appear that Boethius’ distinction between parts of the whole and 
parts of the parts is intended as a challenge to classical extensional mereology’s principle 
of Transitivity (2.3).   
However, I think it would be too strong to conclude from this passage that 
Boethius rejects Transitivity outright.  Indeed, he says that in some sense the letters and 
syllables are parts of the book.  What this passage suggests is that dividing the book 
immediately into letters would be an illegitimate division of the book.  The letters may 
ultimately be elements of the book, but one only arrives at the letters by first dividing into 
verses, then verses into syllables, and finally syllables into letters.  Boethius does not 
reject Transitivity.  He is merely indicating that classical extensional mereology’s 
unrestricted notion of ‘proper part’ will not give us an adequate principle for making 
divisions.  Based on the unrestricted notion of a proper part, an immediate division of the 
book into letters would be legitimate, for letters are proper parts of the book.  But 
Boethius is suggesting that a legitimate division must not only result in proper parts, it 
should result in principal parts.109 
                                                 
109 In my view, Boethius’ privileging of divisions is at least one impetus for the development of the twelfth-
century notion of “principal parts”.  We know from Abelard that there was a debate in the schools for how 
one determines the principle parts of a whole (Dial. 548.29 ff.).  Some argue that it is the parts that the 
principal parts are the ones that are parts of the whole, but not parts of a proper part of the whole—that is, x 
and y are principle parts x << the whole and y << the whole, and there is no other item, z, such that z << 
the whole, and x << z and y << z.  Others suggested that the requirement that the parts must not themselves 
be parts of a proper part of the whole be dropped: the principal parts are those that immediately make up 
the whole when collected together in the right way.  Still others argued that the principal parts are those 
that, once removed destroy the whole.  Each proposal attempts to find principles for determining whether a 
division is appropriate.

3.3.3: On static identity 
As I mentioned in the previous chapter, one can divide the issues pertaining to 
identity into two broad classes (2.5).  The first class of concerns has to do with static 
identity.  The second class of concerns revolves around identity through time, or 
persistence.  Boethius lays the ground for the early medieval study of the relation 
between mereology and static identity.  Once more Boethius’ remarks are generally 
suggestive, but they are not developed into a satisfactory theory.  
In section 3.2.4 I suggested a theory of sameness implied by Boethius’ thoughts 
about the difference between a part and its whole.  Unfortunately, this account of 
sameness is not present in his explicit treatments of static identity.  Where Boethius does 
go into detail about his theory of sameness and difference he presents these three modes: 
sameness/difference in genus, sameness/difference in species, and sameness/difference in 
number (In Isag. II, 192, 10-19; cf. De Trin. 1.48 ff.).  Boethius lays down several rules 
governing the relations between the three modes of sameness and difference.  Rule one: 
even if x and y are the same in species (or genus), it is possible that x and y differ 
numerically.  Rule two: if x and y are numerically the same, then necessarily x and y are 
the same in species and in genus.  Rule three: if x and y are different in species, then x 
and y must be different numerically. 
If we restrict ourselves to Boethius’ three explicit modes of static identity, he 
cannot explain the difference between the hand and the body.  Clearly, Socrates’ hand is 
not Socrates’ body.  But we may ask: In which of the three respects is the hand not the 
same as Socrates?  We can immediately rule out the option that the hand and Socrates’ 

 
 
 
128
body are different in genus.  Socrates’ body is a corporeal being, and his hand is also a 
body a corporeal entity.  Hence, Socrates’ body and his hand are the same in genus.  
Perhaps Socrates’ hand and his body differ in species.  This seems plausible initially.  
After all, Socrates’ body and Socrates’ hand are two types of thing—one is a human 
body, the other is a hand.  But, there are immediate difficulties.  First, it will be hard for 
many Aristotelians to stomach the notion that there is a species (Human) Hand.  Species 
and genera correspond to what are now called natural kinds.  Parts of natural kinds are 
not natural kinds (Syrianus In Metaph. 107.5-18).  Yet, even if we loosen our notion of 
species in order to accommodate ‘species’ such as Hand, there is still a problem.  By 
Boethius’ third rule, if x and y differ in species, then they must differ numerically.  Since, 
by hypothesis, Socrates’ body and Socrates’ hand are different in species, Socrates’ body 
and Socrates’ hand also differ numerically.  Therefore, if Socrates and his hand differ in 
the second respect, they also differ in the third possible respect.  But it doesn’t seem right 
to claim that the hand is numerically distinct from its body.  After all, the body contains 
the hand.  The hand is numerically different from the body-less-the-hand, but how can the 
hand be numerically distinct from something that contains the hand.  What Boethius 
sorely needs is the notion of mereological overlap, as my proposed characterization of 
“being the same thing as” made implicit use of (3.2.4).   
Some remarks buried in Boethius’ treatments of part and whole suggest a more 
nuanced understanding of the relationship between mereology and identity.  For example, 
Boethius claims that while the genus is “related to” its species, and the species to its 
genus the two are not the same (In Cic. Top. 295.30-32).  The species is composed of the 

 
 
 
129
substantial differentia in addition to the genus.110  And, “it is impossible for something to 
be other (aliud), unless there is a difference in some part” (294.7-8).  At first blush, what 
Boethius says in his commentary on Cicero clashes with his pronouncement in the De 
Divisione that the genus is the same thing as the species.  But, in fact, Boethius does not 
contradict himself.  The De Divisione passage is best construed as a claim about the lack 
of matter in the genus and the species, and hence the lack of true composition.  In his 
commentary on Cicero, Boethius is talking about the definitional parts of the species—
that is, the internal structure of the species.  And clearly, the species differs from its 
genus because the genus is only one feature of the species’ structure.  There is also the 
form-like aspect in the species’ structure. 
Boethius might not be aware of it, but if generalized as a basic rule about identity, 
Boethius’ claim about the difference between genera and species is strikingly prophetic.  
The generalized principle reads: x is not different from y unless x and y fail to 
mereologically coincide.  This principle will become the foundation of Abelard’s original 
theory of numerical sameness and difference (4.2.1).  But Boethius himself does not 
explicitly make the connection between mereological coincidence and numerical 
sameness.  Rather, he focuses upon the numerical difference of discrete objects, and he 
attributes numerical difference to differences in accidental forms (In Cic. Top. 332.29-30; 
De Trin. 1.56-63).111  But with respect to the question whether a part is numerically the 
                                                 
110 The differentia “completes” the substance of the species (In Cic. Top. 320.38-42). 
111 Boethius’ explicit treatment of numerical sameness and difference is consistent with his insistence in the 
De Trinitate that everything is what it is because of its forms, not its matter (II.83-89). 

 
 
 
130
same, or numerically different from its whole, Boethius’ explicit account of numerical 
sameness is incapable of doing the job, as I will show in the next chapter (4.2.1). 
Boethius also has trouble articulating an adequate account of the relation between 
the sum of a thing’s parts and the whole.  In his commentary on Cicero’s Topics Boethius 
states that a concrete thing is the same as the whole, and the whole is its parts conjoined 
together (In Cic. Top. 285.24-28): 
Every single thing (res) is the same as he whole (idem quod totum).  For example, 
Rome is the same as that which is the whole citizenry (tota civitas).  Each and 
every thing is also the same as each of its parts when they are brought together 
into one [thing].  For example, a man is the same as the head, throat, belly, feet, 
and the rest of the parts brought together and conjoined into one [thing]. 
 
But since a part in this tradition is always a proper part, no single part by itself is identical 
to its whole.  This is contrasted with the claim that the genus is the same as each of its 
parts taken singularly. 
The contrast between integral wholes and their parts is highlighted by the 
difference in predication, and it sometimes appears that the predicative difference is 
intended to explain the difference in the identity relations.  The name of a thing—i.e. an 
integral whole—is predicated of its parts only when these parts are combined together 
“into one thing” (In Cic. Top. 289.14-16 and 331.10-15).  House, for example, is not 
predicated of the wall alone.  It is only predicated of the wall in conjunction with the 
other walls, the roof and the floor.  In contrast, the species Man by itself takes the 
predication of Animal.   
Boethius could be more precise in his formulation of the static identity that holds 
between a whole and its parts.  For is a whole nothing other than its parts taken together?  

 
 
 
131
It seems not, since a house is not the walls, floor, and roof laid in a pile without the 
appropriate structure.  Boethius just might recognize this fact, as he often requires that the 
parts be combined together into “one” item.  For example consider the sentence 
highlighted in the following passage (In Cic. Top. 286.8-15): 
I mean by ‘substantial parts’ those which do not embrace a magnitude, but rather 
those which [embrace] the property and account of a substance.  Yet, what is said 
in the case of a definition with respect to those parts that embrace a substance, 
should [also] be understood in the case of the parts which create a magnitude of, 
say, a house—which is composed out of a floor, walls, and a roof.  For while 
these [parts]112 are nothing other than that which is composed by the parts, this 
[house] is something one and conjoined.  And the partition of [the house] is a 
distribution through certain members. 
 
The species is not a sum of definitional components, it is a unity composed out of these 
components.  Likewise, the house is some one thing composed out of these parts.  But a 
pile, we might claim, does not form a solid unity.  Piles are weaker sorts of unities, since 
their parts are easier to dislodge.  On the other end of the spectrum, as Boethius reminds 
us in De Trinitate, things that altogether lack matter have a greater degree of both unity 
and being (2.102-106).  Perhaps the requirement that the parts be unified is intended to 
eliminate the case of the pile of house parts.    
But if this is what Boethius intends, he could certainly be more careful when 
spelling out the conditions under which a collection of parts is the same as the whole.  It 
will take until the twelfth century for philosophers to unambiguously acknowledge that 
the whole requires more than merely the parts; it requires that the parts possess the 
appropriate arrangement. 
                                                 
112 I take ea to be the neuter, plural nominative, referring back to the floor, walls and roof in line 12 (rather 
than the feminine, singular, referring to domus as well).  The feminine pronoun ipsa clearly refers back to 
the noun domus. 

 
 
 
132
3.3.4: The ontological dependence of wholes upon their parts 
Boethius’ treatment of natural priority in the De Divisione implies that wholes are 
ontologically dependent upon their parts (3.2.2).  Taken in its strongest form, this claim 
entails a version of mereological essentialism.  But it is not obvious that Boethius really 
takes such a strong view.  The passage itself, along with other textual evidence, provides 
some clues that Boethius is not a mereological essentialist. 
The reader will recall from my examination of the differences between the genus 
and the whole that the rule that parts are naturally prior to their wholes, at best, applies to 
integral wholes and their parts.  But even if this thesis were to apply only to integral 
wholes, it would amount to a striking divergence from the Aristotelian mereological 
tradition. 
In his Metaphysics Aristotle asserts that some parts of substances are prior, some 
are posterior, and some seem to exist simultaneously with their wholes (Z.10, 1035b3 ff.).  
The parts of the definition (logos) are prior in account (and probably in nature) to the 
whole definition or essence.  And since the essence is prior in account and nature to the 
composite, the definitional parts are prior in nature and account to the whole composite 
(1035b14-20).   
More importantly, other parts—for example, the parts of the composite—are 
posterior in account and nature to the whole composite.  Consider the famous Aristotelian 
example of the finger: If the finger is severed, or the human being dies, the finger is no 
longer a finger except “in name” (1035b24-25, cf. De Anima 412b20-22).  Fingers, and 

 
 
 
133
other organs, are defined in terms of their functions.113  If the finger is severed, the bit of 
matter that was the finger ceases to be a finger.  For a while, this bit of matter retains the 
shape of a finger, but it does not retain the function of a finger.  In order for a bit of 
matter to be a finger, it must be incorporated in the right way within a larger bit of matter 
(the body) which is itself combined with the appropriate form.  The necessary presence of 
form also explains why the finger is posterior in account.  When giving a characterization 
of the finger, one must make mention of its role within the larger whole.  The finger’s 
role within the larger whole is determined by the form of the whole.   
Still other parts seem to be “simultaneous” (hama)—for example, perhaps the 
head and the heart of the composite animal.  For if the heart or head is destroyed, then the 
composite substance is destroyed; and if the composite is destroyed, then the heart and 
head cease to be organs (Metaph. Z.10, 1035b25-27; cf. Asclepius In Metaph. 415.22-
26).  They are heart and head only in name. 
If we take Boethius’ statement in the De Divisione as the final word about the 
ontological dependence of integral wholes to their parts, all this Aristotelian nuance is 
lost.  Hence, there are two pressing questions.  Is this statement in the De Divisione the 
final word on the matter?  And if it is, why does Boethius forsake the Aristotelian 
tradition?  I will suggest that the answer to the first question is a tentative ‘probably not’.   
                                                 
113 Form, actuality and function are strongly correlated by Aristotle.  For example, in Metaphysics H.2, he 
states that the enumeration of the material parts of a house yields the “potential house” (tên dunamei 
oikian).  Giving the function of the house yields the actuality of the house.  The composite house is 
constituted out of the function (i.e. form) and matter (1043a15-20). 

 
 
 
134
But given the way that Boethius presents the mereology of integral wholes, unfortunately 
much of the subtlety of Aristotelian mereology ends up being distorted or lost to the early 
medieval thinkers. 
Boethius’ claim about the ontological dependence of the whole upon its parts at 
first seems to commit him to a form of mereological essentialism.  But a second reading 
of the passage at De Divisione 879c shows that Boethius need not be committed to an 
extreme form of mereological essentialism.  First, consider Boethius’ concrete example.  
We have a house whose roof is removed.  Not just any part has been removed.  The roof 
is a part that removes the functionality of the house along with it.  Boethius does not tell 
us whether the removal of a sliver from the door frame would also necessarily entail the 
destruction of the house.  One might insist that Boethius stick to his guns:  He explicitly 
states that, universally, parts are naturally prior to their wholes.  Thus, if something is a 
part of the house, its removal entails the destruction of the house.  But Boethius could 
deny that the sliver is a part of the house.  Recalling his discussion of privileged 
divisions, he might say that the sliver is strictly speaking a part of a part of the house, and 
that the rule about natural priority does not cover parts of parts.  If this is what Boethius 
would say, then he anticipates a move that twelfth-century Moderates will make with 
respect what I call the Mereological Sorites (see 5.1.2). 
Denying that the sliver from the door frame is a part of the house is one possible 
way out, but not a very good one, and I think it is not what Boethius actually thinks.  We 
must take Boethius at his word when he says that if a part is removed—that is if any part 
is removed—the whole perishes.  There is still another clue that there is more to the story 

 
 
 
135
in De Divisione 879c.  Note that Boethius says, if a part of a whole perishes “the whole, 
whose one part has been destroyed” will not exist.  This remark hints at a principle that 
will be a central part of Abelard’s theory of persistence: namely distinguishing between 
this house—the one that contains the sliver—and a house (see section 4.3.1).  As Abelard 
will argue, if I remove the sliver, that house which possessed the sliver will no longer 
exist, but this does not entail that no house will exist upon removal of the sliver.  As 
suggestive as this hint is, it remains only a hint.  Boethius seems unconcerned about the 
potential onset of mereological essentialism, and so an explicit distinction along these 
lines is not made until we reach the twelfth century.  
In fact, Boethius is usually content to assert the natural priority of any part to its 
whole.  For example, in his commentary on Cicero’s Topics Boethius applies this notion 
to topical inferences (In Cic. Top. 289.35-39):  
If you want to destroy [an argument based upon the whole] it will suffice for you 
to dislodge one part.  If you want to add [a premise concerning the whole to an 
argument], you must by necessity show that all of [the whole] is present.  If you 
want to demonstrate that there is no house, it suffices for you to show that there is 
either no foundation, or no wall, or no roof, since if any one of them is lacking, 
one cannot use the name ‘house’.  But if you want to demonstrate that there is a 
house, you will not be able to defend what you propose unless you can join all 
into one. 
 
While in this context, Boethius is focused on how to support or refute arguments, at other 
points in the same treatise he sounds like he is making a metaphysical point (In Cic. Top. 
331.23-29): 
The genus is always prior to its species, whereas a whole is posterior to its parts.  
Unless the parts exist, the whole is not made.  Thus, it happens that if the genus 
perishes, the species also perish.  If a species disappears, the genus remains.  But 
the opposite holds in the case of the parts and the whole: if any one part perishes, 

 
 
 
136
the whole necessarily disappears.  If the whole, which the parts compose, is 
dispersed, the parts remain albeit scattered. 
 
If one of the parts of the house is removed and placed on the ground beside it, the house 
no longer exists—since the “conjunction” has been destroyed—but the parts still exist in 
a scattered state.  The same point is reiterated in his treatment of the Trinity.  In his 
theological work, Boethius claims that simple objects self-sufficiently exist—each one is 
an “id quod est”.  But composite beings depend upon their parts for their existence (De 
Trin. 2.92-102; cf. De Heb. props. vii-viii). 
In general, Boethius and his neoplatonic forebears appear to be thinking of 
another sense of ‘whole’ when they state this rule about the dependence of the whole 
upon its parts.  This second sense of ‘whole’ is based upon one of Aristotle’s broad 
definitions of ‘whole’ in his Metaphysics:  “The whole is that which lacks none of the 
things which are its parts.” (∆.26, 1023b26-8)  Here the sense of ‘whole’ is roughly 
equivalent to ‘complete’ or ‘all there’.114  According to this second definition, the house 
is “whole” only if all its parts are present and intact.   
The whole defined by the Aristotelian definition is contrasted with an entity that 
is “mutilated” (kolobon).  One of the conditions which must apply to a thing for it to be 
mutilated is that “the substance must remain” even though it is lacking some part 
(Aristotle Metaph. ∆.27, 1024a16).  A cup is the example Aristotle considers.  A cup is 
not mutilated if it is unable to retain its function, as would be the case if we were to cut a 
hole into its bottom.  On the other hand, should we chip a piece off the handle, the cup is 
                                                 
114 For example, see Asclepius’ example of the teleios anthrôpos, or “complete man” (In Metaph. 346.11-
12).   

 
 
 
137
not complete, but it is still a cup.  Hence, it is a mutilated cup.  This second broad 
definition of ‘whole’ and its corresponding notion of mutilation are not applied to non-
concrete items such as universals.  To my knowledge, no ancient or medieval philosopher 
thinks about mutilated genera.  Indeed, if a specific theory of genera and species allowed 
for mutilation, these philosophers would take this as evidence that the theory is incorrect.  
This sense of ‘whole’ as complete, and its corresponding notion of being 
mutilated, is worth considering because (like several of Aristotle’s distinctions) it does 
not make it to the early medieval period intact.115  Considered with respect to Aristotle’s 
sense of whole as being all there, Boethius’ claim that if any part is removed the whole 
perishes is true but trivial.  If I remove a part from the house it is not whole.  But it does 
                                                 
115 Eriugena is the only philosopher of the period who even hints that he has heard of the notion of being 
mutilated.  The hint appears in an argument against those theologians who claim that only human souls 
survive death.  The souls of irrational animals, they claim, perish along with their bodies.  Eriugena insists 
that this cannot be so, since it would entail that the genus of Rational and Irrational Animal, i.e. Life, will 
be “ruined”.  The key portion of the argument is found in the following text (Periphyseon III. 737b-c):  
“Therefore if one species perishes after the dissolution of the body, whereas the other remains, how does 
the genus of these [species] conserve its whole?  Reason dictates that their genus dies when the species are 
destroyed, just as it is necessary that every species perishes when their genus perishes.  The genus is 
preserved in its species, and the species in their genus.  If however some of the species that are constituted 
under a genus can die and do die, and others cannot die and do not die, what shall we say about their 
genus?  Does it perish in some [of its species] and not perish in others?  An integral [whole] (integrum) 
cannot persist when some of its parts happen to perish.  For this reason there will not be a genus, but the 
ruins of a genus (generis ruina).”  Eriugena also hints at the notion of being kolobon in his commentary on 
Martianus Capella (Annotationes 99.15-19 my emphasis):  “For example, we cannot call the hand of Cicero 
a relative, and likewise we cannot call a hand of Human Being a relative.  [This is] because they do not 
allow the [process of conversion] whereby ‘a hand of Cicero’ and ‘Cicero of a hand’, and ‘a hand of 
Human Being’ and ‘Human Being of a hand’, can be convertible.  For when one part is destroyed, the 
whole cannot remain as something complete.”  The genus that loses a species would be the “ruins of a 
genus” and that the Cicero, who loses a hand, is not a “complete” Cicero.  Does this mean that Eriugena is 
the first medieval to acknowledge the intuition that we often claim that integral wholes suffer the loss of 
parts without suffering the loss of identity or being?  While tempting, we cannot draw conclusions too 
hastily.  The remark in the commentary on Martianus is not followed up.  And in the argument with the 
theologians, Eriugena must actually make a stronger claim to get the argument to be valid.  Eriugena needs 
the much stronger claim that the whole ceases to exist.  The “ruins” of the genus must be like the ruins of 
Museum’s dinosaur skeleton after one has taken out and destroyed the thigh bone, where the rest of the 
bones are lying on the floor in a heap.  If the species Irrational Soul could perish and thereby only mutilate 
the genus Life, Life would still persist, and Eriugena would be unable to complete his reductio ad 
absurdum. 

 
 
 
138
not follow that the house does not exist.  If I remove a sliver from the doorframe the 
house is mutilated, not destroyed.  The only way to secure the claim that the house 
perishes when the sliver is removed is to assert the strong thesis that a house is identical 
to its parts.  
To show that Boethius does not subscribe to mereological essentialism, one would 
like to see him draw the distinction between something that is complete and something 
that is mutilated.  But Boethius never makes an explicit appeal to these notions.  Why 
does Boethius not consider this basic distinction between a whole as an individual and a 
whole that is a complete individual?  Perhaps Boethius’ omission is explained if we 
suppose that when thinking about the persistence of wholes Boethius’ paradigms were 
not things like cups and houses, but rather things like piles or crowds.  In chapter 2, I 
suggested that an aggregate’s identity is solely determined by the members that make it 
up (2.5).  Therefore, if we remove any one stone from the pile, that pile indeed ceases to 
exist.  A whole which is strictly defined by its parts is naturally only one thing collected 
out of many things if and only if all its parts are there.  What appears to have occurred 
among the neoplatonic students of Aristotle’s logic is a subtle, but important confusion 
between complex continuous wholes and relatively structureless discrete wholes. 
Ideally, to show that Boethius is not a mereological essentialist we would like to 
see Boethius explicitly appeal to Aristotle’s hylomorphic theory and to make use of the 
concept of mutilation.  But Boethius shows no interest in these concepts, let alone in the 
problems for which these concepts would prove useful.  Consequently, Boethius does not 

 
 
 
139
transfer Aristotle’s mature hylomorphism to the early Middle Ages.116  While form and 
matter are mainstays of early medieval metaphysics, there is a general amnesia 
concerning the mature Aristotelian theory of hylomorphism, and its corresponding theory 
of homonomy.  Combine these crucial omissions with the fact that Boethius does not 
consider the plausible notion that some parts of integral wholes are naturally prior, some 
are posterior, and some are neither, and it is little wonder that Boethius’ pronouncements 
set the stage for a version of mereological essentialism that preoccupied philosophers in 
the middle of the twelfth century.  
 
3.4: Conclusion to chapter 3 
Boethius says many intriguing things about the variety of wholes and parts.  The 
introductory nature of his treatments also guaranteed that they were widely studied by 
students of philosophy in the middle ages.  Unfortunately, this virtue has a corresponding 
vice.  Perhaps because he sees his audience as those who are beginning philosophy, 
Boethius often glides quickly over subjects where the advanced student wants more 
precision and detail.  In a higher level treatise, Boethius might have been more careful to, 
for example, qualify his claim that the part is naturally prior to its whole.  He might have 
                                                 
116 In regards to hylomorphism, Cassiodorus and Isidore are not much better.  Cassiodorus relates some of 
the main neoplatonic claims about the relation of the soul to the body, but he does not discuss the fusion of 
form and matter.  The soul, Cassiodorus claims, is “diffused throughout the entire body” (corpore toto 
diffusa) (De Anima X.1; p. 553).  The soul is a whole in its parts.  It is neither lesser in one place and 
greater in another, “but rather more attentive at one point and more removed at another” (sed alicubi 
intentius alicubi remissius) (idem. IV. 65-71; p. 540).  Cassiodorus adds that for this reason, the soul has 
characteristics similar to God (idem. VI.14-15; p. 547; cf. IV. 138 ff., and V.20 ff.). When discussing the 
difference between flesh and body, Isidore has the opportunity to present the doctrine of hylomorphic parts 
and the principle of homonymy, but he declines to introduce either concept (Etymologiae XI, i, 17).  He 
merely mentions that the soul is what vivifies a body (XI, i, 13). 

 
 
 
140
also elaborated on the role that form plays in the persistence of individuals.  Without 
these qualifications, however, his early readers were left with a strict set of rules.  In the 
next two chapters the reader should note how Abelard and Pseudo-Joscelin adapt 
Boethius’ principles.  In particular, one should be mindful of places where Boethius’ 
hints are noticed and elaborated upon.

 
 
 
141
CHAPTER 4 
 
 
ABELARD’S MEREOLOGY AND ITS ROLE IN METAPHYSICS 
 
 
 
 
We are now in a position to study twelfth-century metaphysical mereology as it is 
practiced by two of the century’s best metaphysicians.  I start with the better known of 
the two.  Abelard’s theoretical work on the relationships between wholes and their parts 
is remarkable for its sophistication and precision as well as its breadth of application.  
Abelard consolidates the insights of the Boethian tradition, applies them to a nominalist 
ontology (4.1), and explores their applications to the larger issues of identity (4.2.1), 
material constitution (4.2.2) and persistence through time and change (4.3). 
 
4.1: Abelard’s metaphysics 
 
In order to appreciate Abelard’s mereology, as well as his theory of identity and 
persistence, it is necessary to summarize several aspects of his general metaphysics.  The 
remarks will naturally segue into a general discussion of Abelard’s mereology.  Once 
these general remarks are made, we will be in a position to analyze Abelard’s application 
of mereological principles and theses to the broader issues of identity, material 
constitution, and persistence. 
 

 
 
 
142
4.1.1: Ontology 
Abelard’s ontology is austere.  The word ‘thing’ (res) designates a restricted class 
of items.  In the mundane world only souls, bodies and some forms are real, or things.  
Moreover, every thing is particular.  There are no universal things.117  Abelard’s thesis 
that no thing is universal and the arguments that support it also entail that no constituent 
of a thing is universal, which is contrary to a view common in the eleventh and twelfth 
centuries that mundane objects are particular, but composed out of at least some universal 
elements.118 
Abelard’s stance on the status of universals invites one to describe Abelard as a 
nominalist.  But the terms ‘realist’ and ‘nominalist’ can be deceiving.119  Contemporary 
philosophers tend to characterize nominalism in one of two ways: (i) as the thesis that 
there are no abstract entities, but only concrete entities, or (ii) as the thesis that every 
occupant of the world is particular.  Neither contemporary characterization of nominalism 
cleanly captures the shape of medieval nominalisms and realisms.   
                                                 
117 Some commentators have worried that Abelard’s stance on universals is inconsistent.  In particular, 
several commentators have worried about the details of Abelard’s positive solution to the problem of 
universals.  This line of criticism is raised in Tweedale’s groundbreaking study of Abelard’s theory of 
universals (1976, 208); although he thinks that Abelard can answer the challenge (idem. 215-16).  Most 
recently, Marenbon has worried whether Abelard’s theory of differentiae undermines his commitment to 
the irreality of universals (1997, 195-201). 
118 One version of this theory is presented by Abelard as that held by his teacher William of Champeaux.  
Abelard presents a number of objections to the theory (Log. Ingr. 1, 11.10-13.17; LNPS 515.32-38), as well 
as objections to its correlative theory of individuation by accidents (Log. Ingr. 1, 64.7-19).  Abelard reports 
that his objections to William’s first theory were decisive (Hist. Calam. 65.80-90).  On material essence 
realism see Tweedale (1976, 95-111), King (2004, 69), and Gracia (1984, 198-215). 
119 On this point see especially Jolivet (1981).  As Christopher Martin points out, we moderns tend to focus 
upon not just genus and species predicates, but also accident predicates, whereas the medieval philosophers 
focused almost exlcuively upon the former (1992, 111). 

 
 
 
143
The first characterization, (i), with its division between the abstract and the 
concrete is not particularly helpful, unless we think that ‘concrete’ is synonymous with 
‘being a res’.  This may well be what some philosophers have in mind when they resort 
to this division.  But a survey of contemporary metaphysical literature quickly indicates 
that there is no consensus on the meaning of ‘concrete’ and ‘abstract’.120  Consider the 
case of forms.121  All our medieval thinkers think that there are forms, and that these 
forms are things.  Even Abelard seems to think that some forms, namely substantial 
differentiae, are res (see below, 4.1.2). These forms must be particular, if they are to be 
res, and hence Abelard can be characterized as holding a version of “trope” theory.122  
But while both Abelard and many contemporary philosophers hold that tropes are things, 
there is disagreement among philosophers whether tropes are abstract or concrete.  Keith 
Campbell calls tropes “abstract particulars” (1981).  But one could conceivably consider 
tropes to be concrete (for example, see Lewis 1986, 64-65, and 82-86).    
Perhaps the second contemporary characterization, (ii), fares better.  But in fact, 
many of Abelard’s opponents also hold that everything, both composite objects and 
                                                 
120 I am sympathetic to Lewis’ observation that no one has satisfactorily characterized the division between 
the abstract and the concrete (1986, 81 ff.).  There have, nevertheless, been some admirable attempts to 
define the division.  See, for instance, Lowe’s study (1998, 210-27). 
121 Anticipating section 4.1.4, I have no settled views on whether states-of-affairs count as abstracta or 
concreta.  On the status of states-of-affairs, or “facts”, see Lowe (1998, 231-4), and Armstrong (1997, esp. 
113-127).   
122 The classic contemporary expositions of trope theory are Williams (1953) and Campbell (1981).  See 
also the useful conspectus of recent trope theory, its virtues, and problems in Cynthia MacDonald (1998).  
Martin characterizes Abelard as “a transferable trope anti-realist” (1992, 112).  The transferability of tropes 
is derived from Abelard’s claims that this man could have had a different particular differentia or accident 
that it actually had (Log Ingr. 2, 84.14-21, 92.24-27, and 129.34-6).  On this point, see Marenbon (1997, 
114 and 120-22).

constituents, is particular, and yet they will still insist that some thing—a res—is the 
universal.123  In the next chapter we will see how Pseudo-Joscelin develops a realist 
theory which identifies the universal as a collection of things.  Other philosophers of the 
twelfth century attempt to identify in some manner the universal with an individual 
instance.124 Abelard’s understanding of realism includes any theory which attempts to 
identify the universal with a res.  Hence, many theories that we would identify as 
nominalist turn out to be realist in Abelard’s eyes.125 
 
4.1.2: Hylomorphism and the constitution of things 
Abelard thinks that every object in the mundane world is a composite of matter 
and form, and following Boethius, he often talks of matter and form as parts.126  Later 
on—in particular, in our discussion of sameness and difference in being (4.2.1)—we will 
                                                 
123 For a compact survey of the various “realisms” current in the twelfth century, consult Jean Jolivet’s 
important article (1981, 177-81). 
124 These theories have been variously named “identity” theories, “indifference” theories and “status” 
theories.  On the concept of a status, see below.  For descriptions of the theories, and analyses of Abelard’s 
refutation of them, consult Tweedale (1976, 116-27) and King (2004, 71-72). 
125 For this reason, Jolivet prefers to characterize Abelard’s theory of universals as “non-realist” instead of 
“nominalist” (1981, 176-77). 
126 This follows naturally from Abelard’s modification of Boethius’ division of the whole into (1) the 
division  of the whole “with respect to substance” (secundum substantiam), (2)  “with respect to form” 
(secundum formam), and (3) “with respect to both” (Dial. 546.22-24).  The first division is further 
subdivided into (1a) the division of the whole with respect to the “comprehension of a quantity”, and (1b) 
the division with respect to the distribution of a common essence (546.24-26).  Abelard’s (1a) corresponds 
to Boethius’ example of the house.  (1b) corresponds to the species.  (Abelard’s treatment of the mode (1b) 
does not in any way compromise his anti-realism of species and genera.)  Mode (2) corresponds to 
Boethius’ example of the soul, and Abelard’s treatment of the division of the soul in the Dialectica adds 
little to Boethius’ discussion of this mode (558.5 ff., although compare his discussion in In de Div. 194.9-
35, and 197.5-198.3).  Mode (3) corresponds to Boethius’ example of the second way one can divide 
Socrates—viz. into body and soul. 

 
 
 
145
see that the term ‘part’ must take on a much more restricted sense, so that it only applies 
to matter, to such immaterial res as human souls, and perhaps to some forms (namely, the 
substantial differentiae). 
Abelard’s hylomorphism is strikingly different from Aristotelian orthodoxy in 
two important respects.  First, unlike Aristotle, Abelard does not think that the soul is a 
form.127  This follows from the fact that the soul can itself be a subject for its own 
accidents (Log. Ingr. 2, 213.1-5): 
But if the soul were a form, by what argument could [Aristotle] claim in the 
[chapter on] Quality that madness and anger are qualities of the soul?  Has a form 
ever gone mad or become angry?  And again, above he claimed that knowledge 
and literacy are present in the soul as in a subject.  But how can it possess 
knowledge if it is a form? 
 
There is one major difference between on the one hand animal and plant souls, and on the 
other, human souls.  Animal and plant souls are material; human souls are immaterial and 
their “sole source” is God (Hex. 775b).  This distinction arises from Abelard’s 
interpretation of Genesis 1-2.  In the creation story God first forms man’s body out of 
earth and then He breaths life (i.e. the soul) into the body.  In contrast, the myth reports 
that God created all other creatures out of the earth.  Abelard interprets this to mean that 
God created the bodies and souls of plants and animals together, and he speculates that 
their souls must be constructed out of the four elements.  Of course, animal and plant 
souls are quite rarified and subtle things, and “on account of the subtlety of these souls 
they are called ‘spirits’, just as the winds are sometimes called spirits.” (Hex. 774d).  
                                                 
127 Abelard and his contemporaries did not have access to Aristotle’s De Anima.  Abelard’s source for 
Aristotle’s claim that the soul is a form is probably Calcidius commentary on the Timaeus (235.8-236.8, 
and 240.6-14).  Compare Log. Ingr. 2, 212.38-213.1.  

 
 
 
146
Second, Abelard argues that many forms ontologically supervene upon their 
matter (Log. Ingr. 1, 79.5-12):128  
We say that matter strictly speaking is that which is prior in time and takes up as a 
subject the image (fictum) of the maker [sc. the image in the artisan’s mind].  For 
example, the bronze was bronze before it was a statue, and [before] it was 
sculpted by the artisan’s hand so that it became a statue.  We say that form 
properly speaking is that which arises out of the composition of parts.  For 
example, [the form] is that which is found in the statue due the curve or angle of 
the nose, and from the smallness or largeness of the eyes, and from all the rest that 
are due to the arrangement [of the parts].   
 
According to this passage, form supervenes upon the arrangement of the parts of the 
matter.129  In the same passage, Abelard insists that rationality—and by implication many 
substantial differentiae—are not strictly speaking forms.  The inherence of the 
differentiae to the genus is only analogous to that of a form upon its matter (Log. Ingr. 1, 
79.12-17): 
Therefore, the statue is correctly said to be composed out of matter and form.  But 
the substance of a man, which consists of animal and rationality, is not composed 
out of matter and form. The animal, which is the man, was not prior in time to the 
man, nor can it properly be said that the animal became the man.  The man was 
not made by the activity of human manipulation. 
 
Rationality is not strictly speaking a form, since it does not arise in a subject because the 
parts have been arranged in the correct manner.  Nonetheless, Abelard thinks that 
rationality is like a form, and that the composition of a human being out of animal and 
rationality is analogous to that of the composite of matter and form.  As Abelard puts it, 
“man is informed animal”, not animal and a form.  In the latter case there are two things, 
                                                 
128 Cf. LNPS 565.16; and King (2004, 76).  Compare Odo of Cambrai’s identification of form with 
composition (De peccato originali 1092a-b). 
129 Peter King highlights this feature of Abelard’s theory (2004, 76).  

 
 
 
147
in the former case “there is one out of [two]” (Log. Ingr. 1, 81.1-5).  In other words, the 
combination of rationality and animal yields one thing, not a mereological sum of two 
things. 
These remarks about substantial differentiae are puzzling, as Abelard claims in 
other passages that the differentia rationality is a form, and not a quasi-form (Dial. 
559.38-560.2):130 
There now remains that division which we make into both matter and form, for 
example as follows: one part of man is the substance of animal, the other is the 
form of rationality and mortality. 
 
He also says that substantial differentiae like mortality and rationality are res (Log. Ingr. 
1, 70.28).  But if rationality is a form and a res, then Abelard is wrong to claim that all 
forms supervene upon their parts.   
Some of the confusion may plausibly be because Abelard changed his view about 
the status of forms.  John Marenbon, for example, argues that, early in his career, Abelard 
thought that all forms—both accidents and differentiae—are things.  Later on, and 
especially as he confronted the problem of the Trinity, Marenbon detects a reappraisal of 
the status of forms (1997, 112-115 and 155-57).131   
Regardless whether Marenbon’s development hypothesis is correct, it is certainly 
the case that Abelard uses the word ‘form’ equivocally.  Sometimes ‘form’ only 
                                                 
130 Cf. Log. Ingr. 70.21-38, and 298.6-11. 
131 To make his case, Marenbon relies heavily upon Constant Mews’ (1985a) dating of Abelard’s works.  In 
conversation, Peter King has warned that we should treat all such datings with some skepticism.  There is 
some indication that Abelard never completed many of the treatises in our possession, but rather was 
revising them in piecemeal fashion throughout his career.  De Rijk hypothesizes that Abelard composed no 
less than three versions of the Dialectica, and that the third redaction was composed toward the end of his 
life (see his introduction, xii-xxiii). 

 
 
 
148
designates the structures and features of man-made objects—as the last sentence in the 
highlighted quotation from the Logica Ingredientibus indicates: “The man was not made 
by the activity of human manipulation” (79.16-17).  At other times, ‘form’ clearly refers 
to differentiae (Dial. 415.35 ff., and 559.38 ff.).   
The Logica passage is, hence, not the final word on the status of all forms.  In the 
parallel gloss found in the Logica Nostrorum, Abelard reiterates the claim that “the form 
is strictly speaking that which arises from some arrangement of parts”, and for this reason 
rationality is not technically a form (LNPS 564.16 and 564.24-25).  But he adds this 
qualification later on in the discussion (567.33-38):132 
And it should be noted that according to this exposition the thing that is animal 
(animal res ipsa) is called the proper matter of a man and rationality is the proper 
form, since they constitute the human’s concrete being (essentiam humanam).  
But the name ‘animal’ is correctly called the quasi-matter of the name ‘man’ and 
the name ‘rational’ the quasi-form, since they do not constitute the concrete being 
of the name [sc. ‘man’]. 
 
Abelard makes it clear that the man that is composed out of quasi-form, rationality, and 
quasi-matter, animal, is the “common and specific man”, not a particular composite man 
(LNPS 564.9 ff.).  Abelard’s claim that rationality is not technically a form must be 
tempered by his added assertion that the problem whether animal is the matter and 
rational is the form is a problem concerning words, not things.  
Abelard makes it clear in several places that some forms—especially those that 
are imposed upon artifacts—are not real.  But there is also evidence that Abelard thinks 
some forms, in particular substantial differentiae, are real.  In a fragment preserved along 
with a manuscript of Abelard’s Treatise on Understanding the unknown author reports 
                                                 
132 Cf. Dial. 415.34-416.6. 

 
 
 
149
that according to Abelard and his followers only some kinds of forms are concrete things 
(essentiae):133 
Others allow that some forms are things, yet some are not.  For instance, Abelard 
and those of his [followers], who by looking at matters carefully and not creating 
confusion illuminate the dialectical art, claim that no form is a thing except those 
qualities (1) which are present in a subject in such a way that the subject is not 
enough for their existence, or those (2) [for which] the arrangement of parts with 
respect to each other or with another is not necessary—just as the arrangement of 
parts to each other is necessary for the curvature of a finger, and the arrangement 
of the parts of a subject, as well as something else where the subject sits, is 
necessary for the existence of sitting—or those (3) which are present in [the 
subject] on account of something extrinsic in such a way that they cannot exist 
without this [extrinsic element]—e.g. some property is present in a man because 
he owns a horse or a cow such that when this extrinsic thing [sc. the horse or the 
cow] is destroyed this [property] does not remain—or those (4) whose departure 
does not depend upon the addition of a substance to the subject—for example, the 
departure of inanimateness requires the addition of a substance (namely a soul) to 
the subject.134  
 
If this report accurately reflects Abelard’s views—and it is generally agreed that it 
does135—then a great variety of forms are eliminated from Abelard’s ontology.  Most 
significantly the forms of artifacts, which arise from the arrangement of parts, and 
external relational characteristics lose their status as beings.  Nonetheless, according to 
the report, some forms are essentiae; and the forms that seem to meet the criteria best are 
(many of) the substantial differentiae (Marenbon 1997, 159).  Consider, for example, the 
differentia rationality.  A corporeal body as subject is not sufficient for the existence of 
                                                 
133 See section 4.2.1 below for some remarks on the twelfth-century use of the term ‘essentia’.

Marenbon (1997, 159 note 45). 
135 See Marenbon (1997, 159), and King (2004, 75-77).  The summaries provided by Normore (1987) and 
Martin (1992 and 1998) mention nothing about the reducibility of some forms, but nothing in their 
respective reconstructions precludes this possibility. 

 
 
 
150
rationality, since a corporeal body could be irrational.  Rationality does not supervene on 
the arrangement of the matter in its subject.  Rationality is not dependent upon some 
feature extrinsic to its subject.  And rationality does not appear to depend upon the 
addition of a substance in order for it to depart.  (Interestingly, it appears that 
irrationality, and other privative differentiae fail the reality test due to the fourth 
criterion.)  
Some forms have ontological independence.  Other forms, such as shape, 
relational properties, and so forth, only supervene.  Many of the substantial differentiae 
are real.  The forms of artifacts are not real.  This is consistent with Abelard’s insistence 
that artifacts are not substances.  This division between natural and man-made objects is 
reinforced when we examine Abelard’s remarks on the other half of composite objects, 
their matter. 
When it comes to the material aspect of hylomorphic composites, Abelard is also 
revisionary.  Abelard asserts a doctrine of double creation.  In “first creation” God made 
“the matter of things” ex nihilo (Log. Ingr. 2, 298.2-6 and Dial. 419.1-2).  Abelard 
identifies this matter with the four elements (Dial. 419.5-12).  In “second creation” God 
then took these elementary constituents and constructed the full variety of natural 
substances by adding forms (Log. Ingr. 2, 298.6-8 and Dial. 419.15-17).136  In second 
creation, God seems to have followed the patterns outlined in the Tree of Porphyry.  
Abelard views the Tree of Porphyry as an analysis of the metaphysical construction of 
substances.  Abelard is not alone in thinking that the Tree of Porphyry serves as a recipe 
                                                 
136 Only second creation counts as substantial generation, because in first creation there was no thing prior 
to the change that can act as the substrate (Dial. 419.17-20 and Log. Ingr. 2, 298.12-14). 

 
 
 
151
for creating substances.137  But Abelard differs from many of his realist contemporaries 
on the status of the constituents that make up the substance.  Many realists assert that the 
formal constituents of substances are universals.  Abelard insists that from the very start, 
everything is already particular (cf. Log. Ingr. 1, 18.9-11 and 64.20-24).   
Abelard also has a different starting point for his Tree.  In the mundane world, the 
Tree begins with body, not substance (Marenbon 1997, 124).  The ultimate constituents 
of the matter of things, are the four elements, each of which is qualified corporeal 
substance.  Bodies are also the ultimate constituents of things in another manner.  
Following his own master, William of Champeaux, Abelard asserts that all bodies are 
actually composed of planes, all planes of lines, and all lines of points (Log. Ingr. 2, 
179.27-29).138  This is in opposition to the authority of Boethius, who maintains that 
points are “limits”, not parts of lines (In Cat. 205b).139  Points are the smallest units of 
corporeal quantity; and each point inheres in “an indivisible subject”, which Abelard 
                                                 
137 Pseudo-Joscelin also sees the Tree of Porphyry as a guide to the construction of substances (De 
generibus et speciebus §§ 145 ff., and esp. § 152). 
138 On this point consult King (2004, 93-4), and Marenbon (1997, 134-35).  Abelard and his teacher 
William may have been influenced by Isidore of Seville’s Etymologiae, which treats in two adjacent 
chapters the theory of Democritean atoms and the theory of prime matter.  In the chapter on atomism, 
Isidore remarks that atoms are the minutest, indivisible parts of the corporeal world.  These atoms are the 
building blocks for all other corporeal things, including the elements (XIII, ii, 1).  In the very next chapter, 
Isidore describes how prime matter and corporeal forms combine to generate the elements, which in turn 
compose all the other bodies (XIII, iii, 1-3).  Isidore gives the reader no guidance for how to decide 
between or to combine these two theories. 
139 Cf. Porphyry In Cat. 103.4-17.  Aristotle is less definitive, but he says that the parts of a line meet at a 
common limit, the point, which naturally suggests that the point itself is not itself one of the parts of the 
line (Cat. 5a1-2, cf. Boethius In Cat. 204cd).   

 
 
 
152
identifies as the “singular indivisible parts of a body” (Dial. 57.15-16).140  In short, the 
bodies of substances are ultimately composed out of singular, atomic substances.141   
In contrast to Aristotelian orthodoxy, the theory of the elements has been shot-gun 
wed to an atomistic theory of bodies.  Even more significantly, Abelard’s atomism 
threatens to collapse the distinction between quantity and substance.  Points and solids 
are traditionally placed in the category of quantity, and hence they traditionally fall on the 
side of accidents.  Admittedly, early on in commentaries on Aristotle’s Categories, 
quantity maintained an uneasy place as an accident.  Porphyry, for example, suggests that 
the reason that Aristotle jumps immediately from substance to quantity, and not to 
quality, is that even were one to strip all other accidents away from a substance, it would 
still be bounded by some quantity or other (In Cat. 100.21-28).142  Quantity, it was 
recognized, has a very close relationship to the subjects that have it.  Abelard’s analysis, 
however, makes the connection even closer, so that one mode of dividing the whole with  
                                                 
140 Indeed, sometimes Abelard discussion of points appears to be shorthand for a discussion about the 
subjects of points.  In particular, when Abelard claims that bodies are composed out of points, he really 
means that bodies are composed out of atoms.  See Log. Ing. 2, 168.31-169.2 and 179.26-30. 
141 Marenbon resists this conclusion, citing a passage where Abelard draws a distinction between 
“quantitative body” and “substantial body” (Log. Ingr. 2, 189.6-24).  This passage, he insists, shows that 
the two types of body are not identical.  Nevertheless, he concedes that the exact relation between 
quantitative body and substantial body is unclear (1997, 135). 
142 Compare with Abelard: “For even if every part were stripped of quality, they could still make a division 
of the whole of the substance, whose being [the parts] construct, so long as [the parts] remain in [the 
whole’s] comprehension.” (Dial. 574.28-30)  In fact, Porphyry says something even stronger: quantity is 
the precondition for the inherence of other accidents.  Were one to remove quantity, “there would be no 
longer be any number in relation to the continuous or the discrete” (In Cat. 100.25-27). 

 
 
 
153
respect to its substance is in fact to divide the whole in relation to the “comprehension of 
a quantity” (Dial. 546.24-26).  The ramifications of Abelard’s atomism become apparent 
immediately as we turn to integral wholes. 
 
4.1.3: Integral wholes 
In chapter 2, I noted that the first order of business in metaphysical mereology is 
determining what objects count as wholes, and what objects count as parts of these 
wholes (2.2-3).  As I have already indicated, Abelard thinks that there are many kinds of 
wholes.  He also has a few things to say about the corresponding problem of determining 
what things are parts. 
When it comes to material objects, Abelard thinks that it is important to 
distinguish what we might call ingredients from parts.  This is because Abelard 
distinguishes between a loose and a strict sense of matter.  In the looser sense, the grain is 
(some of) the matter of the bread.  But in a stricter sense, the matter is what both 
constitutes the whole and remains in the whole as a part (Dial. 575.18-36).143  Roughly, x 
is a part of y if it is an ingredient of y, and x remains substantially unchanged when it 
begins to constitute y.  Accordingly, we may say that the grain is not a part of the bread, 
but only the crumbs are parts.   
In this chapter we will have to walk a fine line between the looser and stricter 
senses of ‘part’, since we want the indivisible subjects that ultimately make up Socrates’ 
body to count as parts of his body, even though these atoms may change substantially 
                                                 
143 Cf. LNPS 509.22-28, and 564.14-15. 

 
 
 
154
upon the addition of differentiae.  In anticipation of our discussion of identity (4.2.1), we 
do not want to restrict ab initio our notion of part to that of a material part, since there are 
two types of potential part that are not material.  First, although the human soul is 
immaterial, it is a thing, and hence potentially a part of Socrates.  Second, since 
substantial differentiae are real, they also may be parts.  From this point forward, I will 
try to reserve ‘part’ for only those things that meet our working characterization.   
This working notion of a part signifies the sort of thing that can stand in the left-
hand argument of the contemporary mereologist’s relation being a proper part of.  
Abelard has no concept that corresponds to the contemporary mereologist’s notion of a 
being a part of, such that it is possible that something is a part of itself.  “There cannot be 
a part where the quantity of the whole does not exceed [the quantity of the part].” (Dial. 
554.16)  It is worth mentioning at this point that Abelard conveniently overlooks objects 
denoted by mass nouns (Marenbon 1997, 117).  Objects denoted by mass nouns are 
precisely the sorts of object for which the more generous relation being a part of is 
sometimes used. 
The term ‘whole’ is used in a number of different ways as well.  In his treatment 
of division, Abelard follows the common practice of describing universals as wholes, or 
as he would say, “distributive wholes”.  The soul is also described as a “virtual whole”, 
which is distinct from both the universals, and from the central objects of our concern, 
“integral wholes”.   
Like many of Abelard’s contemporaries, the paradigms of integral wholes are 
artifacts (most often a house) and substances (usually poor Socrates).  But in contrast to 

 
 
 
155
his contemporaries, Abelard is very liberal when it comes to determining what items are 
integral wholes.  In addition to the paradigmatic integral wholes, Abelard also asserts that 
some integral wholes are pure “pluralities”—or what I will label “collections”—and 
some are aggregates.   
Collections are not sets.  The only relation is part-to-whole.  There is no set 
membership relation or sub-set relation.  And whereas a set can be a member of another 
set, collections themselves, as opposed to the parts of these collections, cannot be parts of 
other collections.144  Abelard is so liberal regarding what can count as a collection that 
the parts of a collection need not even belong to the same category (Dial. 548.19-21): 145 
For example, this whiteness and this finger belong to one whole (in uno toto 
conveniunt), but one is placed under [the genus] Substance and the other is under 
Quantity. 
 
As we will see in the next chapter (5.1.2), this liberality with respect to what qualifies as 
an integral collection is not widely embraced by Abelard’s contemporaries.  In contrast, 
Abelard’s understanding of collections is widely embraced by modern mereologists.146  
When contemporary mereologists talk about “mereological sums”, they are often talking 
about collections, since the operation of summation says nothing about the location or 
arrangement of the parts that are summed.  Mereological sums are just the enumeration of 
                                                 
144 If a collection A is a proper part of another collection B, this merely means that the proper parts of A are 
proper parts of B. 
145 Cf. Dial. 548.21-22. 
146 In this respect Abelard is more modern than some of his historical contemporaries.  Classical 
extensional mereology is committed to the general existence of sums, such that any two things constitute a 
mereological sum (Simons 1987, 108-12).  Chisholm rejects the existence of many, if not all of these 
collections.  It is possible, on his view, for x and y to exist and yet there is no z, where z = {x + y}.  See his 
axiom 4 (1976, 151).  There is no corresponding axiom in one of his other treatments of mereology (1989, 
69). 

 
 
 
156
the parts that constitute a thing.  For this reason all collections are mereological sums, but 
not all mereological sums are pure collections.  Aggregates as well as the matter 
belonging to structured material objects (such as artifacts and bodies) are also 
mereological sums. 
Aggregates are pluralities of objects that have been brought into spatial proximity.  
Examples of aggregates include crowds, flocks, and heaps of stones.  As these examples 
demonstrate, it is sometimes unclear whether a mereological sum is a collection or an 
aggregate.  A crowd of men can be relatively packed together or dispersed, but at some 
point the men will cease to be a crowd.  When men are scattered across the earth, it is 
clear that they are no longer a crowd.  The process of bringing parts into sufficient 
proximity to constitute an aggregate is referred to as aggregation.   
It should now be clear that describing a mereological sum as an aggregate or a 
collection, is merely a way of characterizing the proximity of the sum’s parts to one 
another.  The parts of a mereological sum may also be related to one another in more 
complex ways; they may be arranged so that they constitute a structured whole.  Most of 
our common sense paradigms of material objects possess an arrangement, or as Abelard 
calls it, a “composition” (compositio) (Log. Ingr. 2, 171.14-17).  Mere aggregation of 
parts is not sufficient.  I do not make a house by merely placing boards, doors, and bricks 
in the same location.   
As we have already mentioned in chapter 2 (2.5) some philosophers think that this 
arrangement is what sets the object apart from its “matter”, which is the mereological 
sum of the object’s constituent material parts.  We may call this a “form-matter” theory 

 
 
 
157
of constitution.  The form-matter theory comes in both a strong version and a weak 
version.  The strong version claims that the arrangement, or “form”, has a robust 
ontological role.  The presence of the form in the matter is a necessary condition for the 
existence of the object.  The form also, according to the strong form-matter theory, is the 
principle of individuation and persistence.  The form can survive a change in the 
underlying mereological sum, and its survival allows the object to possess different 
mereological sums over the span of its existence.  This stronger reading is commonly 
attributed to Aristotle (see 2.5 above).  The weak version of the form-matter theory also 
claims that the arrangement of the material parts distinguishes the object from its matter 
and is a necessary condition for the existence of the object.  However, it is not the case 
that the arrangement is ontologically robust enough to be the principle of persistence.  
Rather, the arrangement is ontologically dependent, or supervenes upon the parts.  
According to the weak form-matter theory, if the underlying matter were changed, the 
form would change as well.  As I will show, in the case of artifacts, Abelard holds a weak 
version of the form-matter theory (4.3.1).  The cases of substances (4.3.3) and persons 
(4.3.4) are more complicated, and for these objects I will argue that Abelard holds a 
stronger form-matter theory.  
Perhaps surprisingly some wholes that require the appropriate arrangement are, 
strictly speaking, “discrete” integral wholes, which means that they are more akin to 
aggregates than they first appear.  In order to be a “continuous” whole, there must be no 
space between parts.  Man-made objects, such as tables and houses, are always discrete 
integral wholes, since their parts, while pressed up closely to one another, still have a gap 

 
 
 
158
between them.  Only God, it turns out, has the power to fuse parts together so that wholes 
are continuous.  Humans can destroy continuous wholes, but try as they might, they 
cannot fuse parts together.  Abelard adheres to this thesis even in the face of apparent 
counter-examples.  For example, glass is a man-made object, but it seems to be fused.  
Abelard concedes that glass is continuous, but he therefore concludes that the fusion of 
the parts is not strictly brought about by human powers (Dial. 419.35-420.6) 
But no secondary acts of creation of this sort lie within our powers.  All creation 
must be ascribed to God alone and is foreign to our acts.  For example, when the 
ash and sand are placed in the kiln in order to be transformed into glass our act 
works toward the particular creation of glass.  But while we are ignorant of the 
physics, it is God who by some unseen means works upon the nature of those 
things which we had prepared, and it is He who makes the new substance.  
Whereas the glass is created by God, it is shaped in any number of containers by 
our work.  Nothing is created, [we only] combine created things.147 
  
Humans only have the power to place parts very close to together—as in the case of 
artifacts like houses—or in the case of a malleable homogeneous substance like glass, to 
apply different shapes to the substance. 
In short, for Abelard, continuous wholes line up with substances.  Artifacts fall on 
the side of discrete wholes, along with aggregations and collections of substances.  This 
difference between mereological sums of substances and artifacts on the one hand, and 
substances on the other hand, must be at the fore of the reader’s mind—especially when 
we consider Abelard’s theory of material constitution (4.2.2) and persistence (4.3). 
                                                 
147 Abelard also considers the case of human procreation.  It may seem that the father and mother generate 
their son, because it is their act of copulation and the addition of the man’s sperm to the mother’s egg that 
initiates the generation of the boy.  But, Abelard insists, the father (i.e. the putative active principle of 
generation) could disappear and the son would still be generated.  Ultimately, “the son is a work of 
Nature—i.e. of God—and not of a man” (Log. Ingr. 2, 298.29-33).   

 
 
 
159
4.1.4: States and states-of-affairs 
Abelard’s metaphysics is austere.  If we take him at his word, he allows only 
bodies and some forms to be things.  Other forms enjoy a status of being a quasi-thing, 
since they supervene upon the arrangement of bodies.  But Abelard’s semantics is much 
richer.  Here Abelard is willing to countenance natures, “states” and states-of-affairs, or 
dicta (Normore 1987, 207).  The role of natures would be important were we interested in 
the problem of universals.  But for a study of mereology they are not important.  States 
and states-of-affairs, on the other hand, will play a significant role.  We must, therefore, 
briefly consider these two components of Abelard’s semantic theory. 
The ontological standing of status and dicta is difficult to determine.  For 
example, Martin Tweedale is tempted to treat status realistically, and to locate it among 
the items in Abelard’s ontology.  Peter King, in contrast, has insisted that we take 
Abelard at his word, and understand that a status is nothing at all.  Naturally 
metaphysicians will ultimately want to get straight about the nature of status and dicta.  
But to the extent that I can, I want to put aside this problem, and focus upon the role that 
status in particular plays in Abelard’s mereology.  My account should work perfectly 
well whether one is a realist or an irrealist with respect to status.  
Abelard argues that the logical relations between, for example, the terms in a 
conditional are not immediately relations between the things denoted by these terms 
(Dial. 293.6 ff.; see Martin 1992, 117-121). In other words, the signification of a sentence 
is not merely the things signified by the terms in the sentence.  Rather, for Abelard, dicta 
are the significata of sentences, and they cause the truth of statements.  Dicta are “what it 

 
 
 
160
is that have logical properties and stand in logical relations; they are necessary, possible, 
logically opposed to one another, entail one another and so on” (Martin 1992, 114).  In 
Christopher Martin’s view, Abelard has “hit upon the notion of propositional content”.  
But the reader should not conclude that Abelard will list dicta among the contents of his 
ontology.  Famously, Abelard refuses to hypostasize dicta.  Dicta, or states-of-affairs, are 
derived from res and the properties of res.  Sometimes the relation between ontology and 
semantics is fairly straightforward: ‘Socrates is rational’ is true because the state-of-
affairs, Socrates being rational, holds.  And this state-of-affairs holds because this thing 
has this form of rationality.   
But, in anticipation of our discussion of material constitution (4.2.2), it is 
important to note that not every state-of-affairs directly mirrors the underlying ontology.  
Take the example of Abelard’s distinction between an utterance (vox) and a word 
(sermo).  The utterance is the physical puff of air; the word is that same puff of air in so 
far as it is a bearer of meaning.  The semantic property of the word is not a form that the 
word possesses.  Rather, it is better to say that it is a “functional” property (King 2004, 
91-92). 
In short, Abelard emphasizes that logical relations do not correspond one-to-one 
with relations between the things signified by the terms appearing in sentences.  Calvin 
Normore nicely summarizes the relation between dicta and ontology (1987, 207): 
I hypothesize that we can sum up the views that makes Abaelard’s theses hang 
together as: 
(1) There are more truths than truth-makers. 
(2) There are more true sentences than truths. 
 

 
 
 
161
There are more truths than truth-makers, since things can participate in many states-of-
affairs.  And there are more true sentences than truths, because the same state-of-affairs 
may underlie more than one true sentence—as, for example, the sentences ‘Socrates is a 
man’ and ‘If Socrates is a man, he is not a donkey’.148 
Abelard also sometimes talks about the “state” (status) that some thing 
participates in.  Nominalists, both contemporary and medieval, claim that there is no 
thing common to both Plato and to Socrates that makes them both human beings.  The 
realist’s response is to ask the nominalist how she can explain the fact that Plato and 
Socrates are both similar in that they are human beings.  One possible nominalist reply is 
to claim that there is no real similarity—after all, the thought runs, real similarity would 
require an explanation.  Rather, the predication of ‘human being’ to both Plato and to 
Socrates is a matter of convention. 
Abelard takes no such path.  Famously, or perhaps infamously, Abelard argues 
that there is no thing (res) in which both Plato and Socrates agree.  Nonetheless, they do 
agree “in that they are men”, or they agree “in the status of man” (Log. Ingr. 1, 19.24-25 
and 20.2-4).  It might seem that Abelard is illicitly appealing to a universal when he uses 
                                                 
148 Abelard and his school, the Nominales, are notorious for holding the view that the same state-of-affairs 
underlies differently tensed statements.  See the report of this view in St. Bonaventure Sent. III, d. 24, art. 1, 
q. 3 (= Iwakuma and Ebbesen 1992, text 64c) and Sent. I, d. 41, art. 2, q. 2 (= Iwakuma and Ebbesen 1992, 
text 64a).  On Bonaventure’s remarks see Normore (1987, 206).  Christopher Martin, however, adds a note 
of caution about using these reports to unravel Abelard’s theory of the relation between dicta and 
sentences.  “Abaelard shows great care in setting out the theory of existentiae rei/rerum or dicta and, in 
particular, in discussing sameness of content in the face of difference in tense when dealing with divine 
knowledge in the Theologia ‘Scholarium’.  We must thus treat with caution the reports from St. 
Bonaventure and St Thomas that the Nominales dealt with this problem by claiming that different 
enuntiabilia signify the same res.” (1992, 115)  

 
 
 
162
the abstract noun ‘status’.149  And indeed some twelfth-century philosophers did 
hypostasize status.150  But Abelard clearly refuses to make a status into a thing.  “Being 
man is no man, nor is it any thing.” (Log. Ingr. 1, 19.25-29)  The state of being a man is 
supra-categorial, just as the characteristics not being in a subject and being receptive to 
contraries are not subjects of accidents or themselves in any of the categories of accident. 
The relation between status and dictum is not entirely clear.  A status appears to 
be the predicative part of the state-of-affairs, and that anything fitting the scheme ‘is x’ 
will be a status.  Hence, Socrates has the status of being Socrates, being white and being 
a man (Normore 1987, 207-10).  But some care is required, since two things can possess 
the same state: Socrates and Plato agree in that they are both men.  They have the same 
state, even though there is no thing that they share in common (Theol. Chr. III §72; p. 
224.931-939).  This animal, P, informed with its P-rationality, shares no real thing with 
that animal, S, and its S-rationality.  Nonetheless, S and P have the same state.  They are 
both rational.  This suggests that Abelard, deep down, is a resemblance-nominalist.151 
                                                 
149 This impression is only worsened by Tweedale’s unfortunate translation of status as “type” (1976, 15 
and passim). 
150 Most notably the author of the Tractatus quoniam de generali et speciali statu rerum, identified by 
Haureau, and following him, Peter King as Walter of Mortagne.  The text is printed in Dijs (1990, 93-113).  
On the attribution to Walter of Mortagne, consult Dijs (idem. 87-88); and King (1982, ch. 3). 
151 Abelard suggests as much, when he says that the “indifference” theories are “closer to the truth of the 
matter” (Log. Ingr. 1, 13.19).  Abelard diverges from the indifference realist by refusing to identify things 
with a universal.  He does not dispute the resemblance aspect of the theories. 

 
 
 
163
Tropes break down into naturally resembling classes.152  But the resemblance, while not a 
matter of human convention, does not require any more explanation than the bruteness of 
the particularity of things. 
Often a thing’s possession of a status is dependent upon the fact that forms inhere 
in the thing or supervene upon an arrangement of the thing’s parts.  Thus, Socrates’ being 
a man is dependent upon the fact that a particular form of rationality, a particular form of 
mortality, and a particular form of bipedality combine with this body.  Yet sometimes, as 
in the cases of the vox/sermo and the Trinity identified above, the possession of a state is 
dependent upon things, but not because of the inherence of a form.   
Both natural things and artifacts can have status.  Abelard himself at one point 
discusses the example of a house having a status.153  But the fact that artifacts can have 
states does not violate the sharp divide that Abelard has drawn between artifacts and 
substances.  At the level of ontology the reasons why artifacts and substances possess 
states are different.  As I noted in 4.1.2, Abelard thinks that artifact production is merely 
the manipulation of substances, not actual substantial generation or destruction.  The 
house is built by manipulating accidental features of the stone, the wood, and the other 
substances that compose it (Log. Ingr. 2, 298.34-36).  A thing will possess the state of 
being a house due to accidental features that are imposed upon the mereological sum of 
things that make up the house.  A substance, on the other hand, is generated or destroyed.  
                                                 
152 Another way of putting this is to point out that things have natures: “Individuals have natures, and in 
virtue of their natures they belong to determinate natural kinds.  But an individual’s nature is not something 
really shared or common to other individuals…  Nor is the nature anything in addition to the substantial 
form and attributes of the individual.” (King 2004, 81) 
153 King (1982, ch. 6). 

 
 
 
164
Abelard describes substantial change as a case where a thing—the substrate—
“relinquishes’ or “gains” a “species state” (speciale status), or “substantial being” 
(substantiale esse) (Log. Ingr. 2, 297.4-5 and Dial. 418.8).  From the vantage of 
Abelard’s ontology, the species state is gained when the appropriate type of differentia-
trope inheres in the substrate.  This difference between artifacts and substances will be 
important later on (see 4.3.2). 
These remarks on states and states-of-affairs are admittedly sketchy, but their 
introduction is required in order to understand Abelard’s theory of material constitution 
and persistence (4.2.2).   
This completes our summary of Abelard’s general metaphysics and mereology.  
We can summarize the findings of section 4.1 with the following statements: 
(I) 
Every thing is particular. 
(II) 
Every constituent of a thing is particular. 
(III) 
Everything in the mundane world is a composite of matter and form. 
(IV) 
However, some forms are not real. 
(V) 
Bodies are the ultimate building blocks of things. 
(VI) 
There are states-of-affairs, but states-of-affairs are not things (res).154 
 
These claims are crucial if one is to understand the details of Abelard’ theory of identity, 
material constitution, and persistence.  The digression into Abelard’s general mereology 
begins to highlight his sophisticated understanding of mereology.  His catalogue of 
wholes shows that he is aware of the vast spectrum of items that are subject to 
mereological relations.  At the same time, he is aware that wholes have differing degrees 
of complexity and structure.  In particular, let me re-emphasize the distinction between 
                                                 
154 Just because status and dicta are not things does not mean that they cannot be causes.  Dicta are the 
cause of a statement being true.  Things possessing a status cause the “imposition”, or baptism, of a word to 
a thing.  (Log. Ingr. 1, 19.21-20.14). 

 
 
 
165
man-made wholes and natural wholes.  Substances are continuous wholes, created by 
God, and characterized by substantial differentiae, whose reality suggests a strong 
version of the form-matter theory of constitution.  Artifacts, in contrast, are discrete 
wholes, which are produced by human manipulation of natural substances.  Their forms 
are accidents, and they supervene upon the arrangement of parts, which means that in 
their case, Abelard subscribes to a weak form-matter theory.  The distinction between 
artifacts and substances will lead to different theories of material constitution and 
persistence.  
 
4.2: Identity 
 
Abelard’s restrictive ontology and mereological sophistication yield an original 
and subtle theory of identity.  In the first part of this section, we will see how Abelard’s 
sensitivity to the relationship between a whole and its parts leads to a startling revision of 
numerical sameness and difference.  This revision is motivated in part by a puzzle 
common to the twelfth century, the Problem of the Many Socrateses.  In the second part, 
we will turn to examine two more modes of sameness and difference, and consider how 
they may help to resolve the perennial problem of material constitution. 
 
4.2.1.: Abelard on numerical sameness 
 
Consider Socrates.  Socrates is a composite of a soul, which is immaterial, and a 
body, which is material.  The soul is indivisible, but the body is divisible into parts.  
Divisibility does not entail actual separation.  Even if Socrates’ body is intact, it can still 

 
 
 
166
be divided into parts.  Likewise, even if the parts are not actually separated from one 
another, they are still numerically distinct from one another.  Presumably this is because 
were one to actually sever, say, the hand from the rest of the body, the two parts—the 
hand and the body-less-the-hand—would be two things.   
One might also think that the body-less-the-hand and the whole body are 
numerically distinct.  Boethius holds this view, since “a part is not the same thing as that 
which is the whole” (De Div. 879c).  And he seems, on the face of it, correct.  The body-
less-the-hand is certainly not numerically the same as the whole body, since the whole 
body possesses a part that the body-less-the-hand does not possess—namely the hand.155  
And if something is not numerically the same as another thing, then the two must be 
numerically distinct.   
Yet, as Abelard points out, something puzzling happens if one grants that the 
body-less-the-hand and the whole body are numerically different (Theol. Chr. III, § 153; 
p. 252.1868-73): 
If it were said that the part is numerically different from its whole, then it would 
have to be conceded that ‘Socrates’ is predicable of many who differ numerically.  
This whole, which is composed out of a hand and the rest of the body, is Socrates.  
But the rest of the body, [considered] apart from the hand, must also be called 
Socrates—that is, is vivified by this soul. 
 
The soul occupies the entirety of the body, and thus the body is a man and is Socrates.  
But the soul also occupies the body-less-the-hand, and were we to actually annihilate the 
                                                 
155 One may insist that there are not two numerically distinct objects present when Socrates’ hand is 
attached to Socrates.  Only when one slices off Socrates’ hand, is it now the case that there are two 
numerically distinct objects.  But there is something strange about this: it appears that we have created an 
object merely through the act of severing the part from the whole.  Yet the hand was there before we sliced 
it off, we did not suddenly create it.  (And stranger still: if we are followers of Aristotle’s mature 
hylomorphic doctrine, we have to say that Socrates’ hand actually ceases to exist when we cut it off.)   

 
 
 
167
hand, the body-less-the-hand would certainly be a man.    Why then isn’t the body-less-
the-hand a man prior to annihilation of the hand?  Furthermore, since it is Socrates’ soul 
that occupies the body-less-the-hand, it seems that the body-less-the-hand is also 
Socrates.  Yet, the body-less-the-hand and the body are numerically distinct.  So there are 
two Socrateses, not one.  More problematic still is the fact that there is nothing special 
about the example of the body-less-the-hand.  We could have just as easily begun with a 
fingernail, a finger, a foot, or a toe.  Indeed, we could have divided Socrates’ body in any 
number of ways.  If we run the same sort of argument in each case, it seems that we have 
many Socrateses, all present contemporaneously in Socrates.  I will call this problem the 
Problem of the Many Socrateses.  The Problem of the Many Socrateses has parallels to 
Geach’s famous puzzle of Tib-Tibbles, or the 1001 cats on the mat (1980, 215-16).156   
Abelard offers a novel solution to this puzzle.  Abelard rejects both the relatively 
uncontroversial claim that the part is numerically the same as its whole, and the more 
interesting claim that a part is numerically different from its whole.  The solution requires 
a revised understanding of numerical sameness and numerical difference—one which can 
account for the relations that hold between things and their parts.   
It is crucial to note that Boethius and the tradition he fosters does not talk about 
“identity” (see 3.2.4 and 3.3.3).  That word is a rarity in both Boethius’ and Abelard’s 
treatises.157  Rather, Boethius and Abelard use the more flexible notions of sameness and 
                                                 
156 An elegant account of the argument and a plausible solution to the puzzle is provided by David Lewis 
(1999, 164-82).  A related puzzle is raised by Pseudo-Joscelin (De generibus et speciebus §§ 21-31).  See 
chapter 5 (5.1.2). 
157 Nonetheless, we will need to appeal to extensional identity to fully develop Abelard’s system.  

 
 
 
168
difference.  According to Boethius things are numerically the same, the same in species, 
or the same in genus.  And there are three corresponding modes of difference: numerical 
difference, difference in species and difference in genus.  The closest thing in Boethius’ 
repertoire to our notion of extensional identity is numerical sameness and difference, but 
as Abelard will show, numerical sameness and difference is more complex than 
extensional identity. 
Abelard eliminates the modes of sameness and difference in species and genus.158  
He keeps numerical sameness and difference and relates this mode to a new mode, that of 
sameness secundum essentiam (or sameness essentialiter), which I will translate as 
“sameness in being” (not—for reasons I go into shortly—as “sameness in essence”).  
Sameness in being and numerical sameness are so closely related that, in his mature 
account, Abelard lists the two types under the same mode.159  Nevertheless, there is a 
subtle distinction not only between numerical sameness and sameness in being, but also 
between numerical sameness and numerical difference.  These subtleties manifest 
themselves when we consider objects with more than one part. 
                                                 
158 Abelard offers six modes of sameness and difference, in contrast to Boethius’ three.  The full list from 
the Theologia Christiana is: (1) sameness and difference in number/being, (2) sameness and difference in 
definition, (3) sameness and difference in property, (4) sameness and difference in likeness (similitudine), 
and (6) sameness and difference with respect to change (Theol. Chr. III, §138). 
159 Unlike the relation between, say, the Logica Ingredientibus and the Dialectica, the chronological 
relation between the Theologiae is fairly clear.  Both internal evidence and historical data indicates that the 
Theologia Summi Boni is the earliest.  The Theologia Christiana and redactions of the Theologia 
Scholarium overlap with respect to their dates of composition; yet the final version of the Theologia 
Scholarium is deemed to be the last completed.  Abelard develops his theory of the relation between 
numerical sameness and sameness in being through this series of treatises.  The account in the Theologia 
Christiana is the most developed account, and will accordingly be given the greatest amount of attention.  
The account in the Theologia Scholarium has a much more cursory treatment of the topic.  A nice summary 
of the difficulties dating the three Theologiae, and especially determining the relation between the 
Theologia Christiana and the various versions of the Scholarium, is provided by Constant Mews (1985b).  
See also Mews’ general summary of the dating of Abelard’s works (1985a) and Buytaert’s study (1974). 

 
 
 
169
Abelard defines sameness in being as a case where the being of one thing is 
numerically the same as the being of the other (Theol. Chr. III, § 139; p. 247.1683-87): 
We say that something is the same in being as another when their being (essentia) 
is numerically the same—i.e. this and that are numerically the same being.  For 
example, the being of the blade is numerically the same as the sword, and a 
substance and a body (or an animal, or a man, or even Socrates) [is numerically 
the same].  And the white thing is numerically the same thing that is hard.160 
 
I should say a few words at this point about what it means for the being of something to 
be numerically the same as the being of another.  Abelard, like most of his 
contemporaries, understands essentia to mean ‘concrete thing’, not the property or 
properties that make something what it is.161  Thus, when he says that the sword and the 
blade are the same in being, he means that the concrete thing that is the sword is 
numerically the same concrete thing that is the blade.  Likewise, Cicero is the same in 
being as Tully because the concrete thing that is Cicero is numerically the same as the 
concrete thing that is Tully. 
It may appear at first pass that sameness in number is left as an unanalyzed 
primitive in Abelard’s system.  But this is not the case.  In order to account for the 
                                                 
160 In the earlier account of sameness and difference, Abelard defined sameness in being as follows: x is the 
same in being as y if and only if the being of x is the same as the being of y (TSB II, iv; and LNPS 558.15-
17).  Something is different in being from another if and only if they are not the same in being.  Numerical 
sameness is defined in terms of not being numerically different, and numerical difference is defined as a 
case where “this is not that” and “no part of this belongs to that” (TSB II, iv, p. 146.848-50).  I hypothesize 
that Abelard changed his account of numerical sameness and sameness in being from the TSB to the Theol. 
Chr. because the earlier account utilized an unanalyzed notion of sameness in its definition of sameness in 
being. 
161 On this point see King (2004, 86), Normore (1992, 90), and Kretzmann (1982, 497).  Consider 
Abelard’s characterization of Material Essence Realism: “Some think the universal is a thing (res), so that 
within things that are discrete from one another in virtue of forms they locate a substance that is the same in 
being; and this [substance] is the material being (materialis essentia) of each [particular] in which it is 
present.” (Log. Ingr. 1, 10.17-19)  In other words, this version of realism posits one concrete entity that is 
entirely present in and is a constituent of many different particulars.   

 
 
 
170
relations between a part and its whole—the very relations that cause trouble for Boethius’ 
account—Abelard’s account of numerical sameness and difference must be subject to 
further analysis.   
If Abelard were to follow the tradition, he might have been tempted to analyze 
numerical sameness in terms of enumerability.  In fact, Boethius seems at times to be 
tempted by this analysis, when he glosses “things differing numerically” as “things 
differing in that they are enumerable”.162  This gloss suggests that x and y are numerically 
distinct because they can be counted as two things.  Abelard acknowledges that 
numerically distinct things are countable.163  But Abelard clearly perceives that the 
direction of explanation points the other way.  Enumerability is founded upon the fact 
that things are numerically distinct or numerically the same.  The phenomenon of 
enumerability will not help us to explain numerical sameness and numerical difference, 
because it is sometimes the case that it is indeterminate whether x and y are one or two 
things.  Specifically, objects that share parts—i.e. overlapping objects—are sometimes 
indeterminate with respect to their number.164  The case of the Many Socrateses is one 
                                                 
162 numero differentibus, id est in numerando differentibus (In Isag. II, 191.8-9).  In all fairness to Boethius, 
it is unclear whether he intends to define numerical sameness and difference in this manner.  For more on 
this matter see chapter 3, sections 3.2.4 and 3.3.3. 
163 “Only those things are numerically different whose diversity admits allocation by enumeration 
(numerando assignari valet)–i.e. when one can say ‘one’, ‘two’, ‘three’ etc.” (TSB II, iv; p. 143.769-71; cf. 
LNPS 558.28-559.4) 
164 Numerical difference occurs only when there is no overlap of parts (Theol. Chr. III §139; p. 247.1689-
98):  “Everything that is the same in being is the same numerically, since if the being of both is the same, a 
number of things cannot be realized in them (in eis multiplicari), nor can a computation be carried out 
based upon the distinction between things, so that ‘one’, ‘two’ etc. is said of them.  Number only occurs in 
distinct beings—i.e. in those things that are so thoroughly distinct that not only this is not that, but one does 
not belong to the other and nothing belonging to one belongs to the other.  In other words, no part of one is 
present in the quantity of the other and the two do not share the same part.”   

 
 
 
171
such instance. Thus, we should look for an account of numerical sameness and difference 
that will explain and perhaps even give us a criterion for deciding the answer to these 
hard cases. 
The key to understanding not only numerical sameness and difference but also 
their relations to sameness and difference in being can be found by examining Abelard’s 
descriptions of difference in being and difference in number.  Abelard describes 
difference in being as follows (Theol. Chr. III, § 148; p. 250.1807-12): 
We say that things are different in being from one another when they differ from 
one another in such a way that this is not that.  For example, Socrates is not Plato 
and Socrates’ hand is not Socrates.  We say that differentiated things are different 
in being when the being of one is not the being of the other, even though the being 
of one might belong to the other, as a hand belongs to a man and a wall to a 
house. 
 
Something is different in being from another if the beings of the two things are 
numerically different from one another.  Plato is different in being from Socrates.  
However, this is not the only case where x is different in being from y.  It is possible for 
the being of x to belong to the being of y, and still x is different in being from y.165  Thus 
for Abelard, a hand belongs to the body as a part belongs to its whole, but the two are 
different in being.  This is because the body has parts other than the hand, and the hand 
plus the head plus the foot are not the same in being as the hand by itself.  But while the 
hand and the body are different in being, Abelard claims that the hand is not numerically 
different from the body (Theol. Chr.  III, § 150; p. 251.1826-29): 
                                                 
165 Theol. Chr. IV, § 12; p. 271.207-211: “[A]ccording to Boethius “the part is not the same thing that is the 
whole” [De Div. 879d] because it is not possible that one and the same being belongs to the whole and the 
part.  For this [part] is included along with the other [parts] in the quantity of the whole; and hence [the 
being of the part] is smaller.” 

 
 
 
172
We say that things are numerically distinct when clearly they are distinct from 
one another with respect to the whole quantity of their being, so that not only is 
this not that, but neither is a part of the other and one does not share the same part 
with another. 
 
The criterion for being numerically different is, thus, more stringent than the criterion for 
being different in being.  If x and y are numerically different, not only is it the case that 
the being of x is not the being of y, x and y utterly fail to overlap—that is, to share any 
part.   
Hence, numerical sameness and difference is subtly distinguished from sameness 
and difference in being.  But, curiously, Abelard also has a unique understanding of the 
relation between numerical sameness and numerical difference.  Consider this cryptic 
summary from his Theologia Christiana (Theol. Chr. III, § 153; p. 252.1862-68 my 
emphasis): 
This should be noted: in every case, if one is the same in being as another, then 
the one is numerically the same as the other, and vice versa.  Nevertheless, it is 
not always true that, if one is different in being from another, they are numerically 
diverse from one another (as we had already said).  For example, a part is 
different in being from its whole, but it is not numerically different.  But perhaps it 
is not the case [that the part is] numerically the same, unless someone says 
‘numerically the same’ in a negative manner –i.e. ‘not numerically distinct’. 
 
The first and second sentences of this paragraph offer nothing controversial: x is 
numerically the same as y if and only if x is the same in being as y; yet it is possible that 
x is different in being from y and yet x is not numerically different from y.  But in the last 
sentences, Abelard claims that a part is not numerically different from its whole and not 
numerically the same as its whole.  In short, Abelard denies the following bi-conditional: 
(N) Necessarily, x is numerically the same as y if and only if x is not numerically 
different from y. 
 

 
 
 
173
This denial is not an afterthought on Abelard’s part.  As I have already indicated, 
Abelard’s solution to the Problem of the Many Socrateses relies upon the rejection of the 
claim that the part is numerically different from the whole; but at the same time, Abelard 
wants to resist a commitment to the view that the part is numerically the same as its 
whole. 
When we frame Abelard’s proposal in the form of the rejection of proposition 
(N), it seems that Abelard is making a mistake.  Isn’t it just analytically true that if x and 
y are not numerically the same, then x and y are numerically different?  But in the case 
where x is a part of y, Abelard has not made a mistake.  Using Abelard’s characterization 
of difference in being and numerical difference, we can motivate the need to deny the bi-
conditional (N) with this simple argument:166  Return to Socrates’ body.  While his left 
hand is different in being from his body, the left hand is not numerically different from 
the body, since to be numerically different, the left hand not only cannot be the body, the 
hand cannot belong to the body.  And for the same reasons, Socrates’ right hand is not 
numerically different from his body.  But, by (N), if the left hand is not numerically 
different from the body, then the left hand is numerically the same as the body.  Again for 
the same reason, the right hand is numerically the same as the body.  If the left hand and 
the right hand are both numerically the same as the body, then the left hand is also 
numerically the same as the right hand.  But this is clearly false.  Hence, we have good 
reason to resist (N).167  
                                                 
166 Thanks to Bill Roche for pointing out this argument to me. 
167 I only claim that it is prima facie evidence for rejecting (N), because it seems that we also should reject 
the transitivity of numerical sameness.  In classical extensional predicate logic with identity, identity is 

 
 
 
174
Abelard’s characterization of numerical sameness and difference, and specifically 
his rejection of (N), demonstrates a subtle appreciation of the relations between wholes 
and their parts.  This subtlety is best appreciated when the theory is presented more 
formally.  For this purpose I will adapt the concept of being a proper part of something 
(_ << _).168  Let us start with numerical difference: 
x is numerically different from y if and only if 
 
(i) it is not the case that the being of x << the being of y, and 
 
(ii) it is not the case that the being of y << the being of x, and 
 
(iii) for all z, it is not the case that the being of z << the being of x and the being 
of z << the being of y. 
 
In short, x and y cannot be overlapping objects.  Or more strictly, the being of x cannot 
overlap the being of y.  Note that the non-overlap condition entails the fact that x is not 
identical to y, since if x is y then the beings of x and of y maximally overlap.   
The present characterization suffices for cases where at least one of the objects is 
a composite.  To make the characterization fully general, we must consider the case 
where x and y both lack parts—that is, when x and y are atoms.  Criteria (i) through (iii) 
will be satisfied both when the atom x is y and when x and y are different atoms.169  
                                                                                                                                                 
transitive (as well as symmetric and reflexive).  So, if a = b and b = c, then a = c.  But, numerical sameness 
cannot be transitive, as the Trinity bears out.  The Father is numerically the same as God, and the Son is 
numerically the same as God.  But it does not follow that the Father is numerically the same as the Son.  
Nonetheless, it is the case that that which is the Father is numerically the same as that which is the Son. 
168 For more on this concept, see our previous discussion in chapter 2 (2.3). 
169 It should be noted that we are using ‘atom’ in its root sense as ‘indivisible’.  Anything that lacks parts is 
an atom according to our present analysis.  Most notably, souls are atoms, since they lack parts into which 
they can be divided.  We use atoms in this inclusive manner since Abelard insists that both substantial 
forms (i.e. differentia) and accidental forms can be numerically distinct from one another (TSB II, iv, p. 
146.854-860; Theol. Chr. III, §150, p. 251.1833-1840).  In his glosses on Porphyry Abelard notes that soul 

 
 
 
175
Abelard offers us no other option than to say that atoms x and y are numerically different 
if and only if x is not identical to y.  In the case where both x and y are atomic, numerical 
difference is due to the fact that x is not identical to y.   
Earlier I noted that Abelard does not use the word ‘identity’ in his treatment of 
sameness and difference.  So, one might be suspicious that I am adding something wholly 
alien and anachronistic to Abelard’s theory.  But there is some basis for assigning an 
extensional notion of identity to Abelard.  In his discussion of the problem of universals 
Abelard asserts that no thing is universal, which means, he says, that everything is 
“personally discrete”.170  Roughly, he seems to have something like the distinctness 
between Socrates and Plato, or this horse and that cow in mind.  But, this notion of 
personal distinctness can be refined to describe the non-identity of atoms.171   
Now that the conditions of numerical difference are spelled out mereologically, 
we can readily compare the difference between numerical difference and difference in 
being.  In contrast to numerical difference, x and y are different in being if there is some 
part that belongs to either the being of x or to the being of y which the other lacks.  The 
hand is different in being from the body because the hand is only a part of the body, and 
                                                                                                                                                 
has no parts, even though it can possess accidents (Log. Ingr. 1, 94.37-38).  The soul can be ‘divided’ into 
powers, but these powers are not parts in the appropriate sense to disqualify souls from being atomic. 
170 In the Logica Ingredientibus “one in number” is glossed as “personally discrete” (Log. Ingr. 2, 157.19).  
When discussing number in his comments on the category of quantity, Abelard says that, “‘Unity’ names a 
thing that is one and discrete in itself; ‘unities’ names things that with respect to their beings personally 
different.” (Log. Ingr. 2, 172.7-9).  When discussing the three-fold analysis of sameness and difference, 
Abelard notes that all things are “numerically discrete” (LNPS 531.33-39). 
171 That souls are both atomic and primitively the same or distinct, is further evidenced by the fact that 
Abelard appeals to the non-departure of the soul as the explanation for the trans-temporal identity of a 
human being.  For more on personal identity, see section 4.3.4. 

 
 
 
176
the whole body possesses parts that do not belong to the hand.  However, because the 
hand is a part of the body, it fails the first condition—(i) above—of being numerically 
different.  Therefore, while the hand is different in being from the body, it is nevertheless 
not numerically different from the body. 
The part is not numerically different from the whole.  We must now show why, 
for Abelard, the part is also not numerically the same as the whole.  To do this we must 
now formulate a mereological characterization of numerical sameness.  Recall that x and 
y are the same in being if and only if the being of x is numerically the same as the being 
of y.  Now I claim that for a large number of cases, what it means for the being of x to be 
numerically the same as the being of y is that the being of x and the being of y completely 
coincide—that is, any part that x has y will also have, and there is no part that either x or 
y does not share with one another.172  
When putting this insight formally, we must consider two cases.  If (1) either x or 
y is composite, the being of x is numerically the same as the being of y if and only if 
there is no z such that, (z << the being of x and ¬ (z << the being of y)) or (¬ (z << the 
being of x) and z << the being of y).  This condition entails that for every part z, z << the 
being of x if and only if z << the being of y.  However, if (2) x and y are both atoms, then  
                                                 
172 As Simons notes, it is “trivially true” that two individuals are identical if and only if their parts are the 
same.  This fact has prompted some mereologists to define the relation of identity in terms of ‘is a part of’ 
(<) or ‘is a proper part of’ (<<).  For pragmatic reasons, Simons develops his systems of formal mereology 
assuming first-order predicate logic with identity (=), but concedes that, “The question whether the part-
whole relation is in some absolute conceptual sense prior or posterior to the identity relation is perhaps not 
as obvious as it may at first appear.” (1987, 11)  See also Sharvy, who argues that the part relation is more 
fundamental than identity.  Sharvy distinguishes between ‘being part of’ and ‘being a part of’.  The former 
is equivalent to ‘being some of’ and is more basic than identity.  Sharvy leaves ‘being a part of’ unanalyzed 
(1983, 234-7).  

 
 
 
177
the being of x is numerically the same as the being of y if and only if x is y.  In accord 
with our discussion of personal discreteness we interpret ‘x is y’ as ‘x is personally the 
same as y’.   
We are now in a position to analyze the conditions under which an object x is 
both not numerically different from y and not numerically the same as y.  Recalling our 
new characterization of numerical sameness, an object x fails to be numerically the same 
as y if x and y are two distinct atoms, or there is some part that belongs to the being of 
one of them that the other does not possess.  The second of these conditions can obtain in 
two different ways: (1) the beings of x and of y can fail to overlap; or (2) the beings of x 
and of y overlap, but they do not coincide. 
Just as there are two basic ways in which x and y can fail to be numerically the 
same, there are also two basic ways in which x and y can not be numerically different.  
Mereologically formulated, x is not numerically different from y only if: 
(i) 
(if x and y are composite, the being of x and the being of y coincide) and 
(if x and y are atomic, the being of x is personally the same as the being of 
y), or 
 
(ii) 
at least one of x and y is composite, and the being of x and the being of y 
do not coincide, but overlap.173 
 
In the first case, x and y are not numerically different if and only if x and y are 
numerically the same.  In the second case the bi-conditional (N) fails.  Because x and y 
overlap, x and y are not numerically different.  But because x and y fail to coincide, x and 
y are not numerically the same.   
                                                 
173 More formally: at least one of x and y is a composite and (1) x << y, or (2) y << x, or (3) there is some a 
such that, a << x and a << y, and there is some b such that, (b << x and ¬ (b << y)) or (¬ (b << x) and b << 
y).  The second conjunct of (3) merely indicates that x and y overlap but do not coincide. 

 
 
 
178
When we combine the conditions under which an object fails to be numerically 
the same and when an object is not numerically different, we arrive at the following 
general characterization of the cases under which the bi-conditional (N) fails:  
x and y are both not numerically the same and not numerically different if and 
only if 
 
(i) there is at least one part, a, such that (a << the being of x and ¬ a  << the being 
of y) or (¬ a << the being of x and a << the being of y), and 
 
(ii) for some b, b << the being of x and b << the being of y. 
 
Both conditions (i) and (ii) must hold for an object to be both not numerically the same 
and not numerically different.  Satisfaction of condition (i) suffices to disqualify x and y 
from being numerically the same, since there is at least one part that one has that the 
other fails to have.  The beings of x and of y fail to coincide.  Satisfaction of condition 
(ii) suffices to disqualify x and y from being numerically different, since either the being 
of x is a proper part of the being of y, the being of y is a proper part of the being of x, or 
the beings of x and of y share at least one part.  It is now clear why it is not a flat out 
contradiction for Abelard to claim that a part is neither numerically the same as its whole, 
nor numerically different from its whole.   
With our mereological characterization of numerical sameness and difference we 
are better equipped to describe the complex set of relations that hold between a material 
thing and its parts, and we are finally able to satisfactorily unravel the Problem of the 
Many Socrateses.  Abelard’s notions of numerical sameness and sameness in being help 
us to describe the variety of relations that hold between a whole and its parts.  For 
example, it is true on Abelard’s account that any two non-overlapping parts of a whole 

 
 
 
179
are numerically different from one another.  My right hand is numerically different from 
my left hand.  At the same time, my right hand is not numerically different from me, and 
my left hand is not numerically different from me.  Nevertheless, it does not turn out that 
my left hand is numerically the same as my right hand, because being not numerically 
different does not entail numerical sameness.  Hands, like all parts of wholes, are not 
numerically different from their bodies and they are not numerically the same.  The 
observation that my hand is not numerically the same as the body—the body which, we 
must not forget, includes that hand as a proper part—prevents the sophistical conclusion 
that the right hand is numerically the same as the left hand.   
The fact that my hand is not numerically different from my body provides us with 
the solution to the Problem of the Many Socrateses.  The Problem arises if one fails to 
distinguish being numerically different from being different in being.  The body-less-the-
hand is different in being from the body containing both hands, since the latter’s being 
possesses a part that the former lacks.  Nonetheless, the two are not numerically different, 
since the being of the body-less-the-hand is a part of the body’s being.  The two beings 
overlap.  Since the two beings are not numerically different, it cannot be the case that 
there are numerically many Socrateses in Socrates. 
Abelard’s theory of numerical sameness and difference offers an elegant analysis 
of the Problem of the Many Socrateses.  The theory accomplishes this aim because it 
carefully considers the relations that hold between a thing and its parts—something 
which the traditional Boethian theory fails to comprehend.  The theory focuses on the 
mereological character of the beings of items, and downplays the phenomenon of 

 
 
 
180
enumerability.  This suggests that the question, “How many things are there?” is 
sometimes an ill-formed question, since a composite object and its proper part will satisfy 
the complex relation being both not the same as and not different from.  This might sound 
odd, but upon due consideration the reader should see that Abelard has hit upon a deep 
problem for any ontology which allows for mereological overlap.  Namely, how do we go 
about counting things in a world where there is overlap? 
 
4.2.2: Identity and material constitution 
Abelard’s theory of numerical sameness and difference, and sameness and 
difference in being describes the relation of objects at the level of their beings, or in so far 
as they are things.  For composite things, numerical sameness and sameness in being are 
determined by the mereological sums that underlie objects.  But these modes of sameness 
and difference are only two out of several more modes of sameness and difference.  
Abelard appreciates the fact that sometimes sameness and difference can be measured by 
considering more than just the being of the objects.  Sometimes one must also consider 
the states (status) that things are in.  The modes of sameness and difference that primarily 
focus upon things and their states are identified as the modes of sameness and difference 
in property, and sameness and difference in definition.  It is only when we turn to the 
states of things that we can discern Abelard’s solution to a perennial problem of 
metaphysics, the problem of material constitution. 
The problem of material constitution can be colorfully illustrated using Alan 
Gibbard’s famous thought experiment (1975).  Consider a case where an artisan takes 

 
 
 
181
some ACME Instant Clay powder, adds water, and as she stirs to form clay, she shapes 
this mixture into the shape of a human being.  But the artist is unhappy with the product, 
and she immediately drops it into a solvent, thereby destroying not only the statue but the 
clay.  The clay and the statue come into existence together and they go out of existence 
together.  For convenience let us label the clay “Lumpl” and the statue “Goliath”.  The 
puzzle is this: is Lumpl identical to Goliath?  There are reasons to answer in the 
affirmative, and reasons to answer in the negative.   
There is good reason to think that Lumpl and Goliath are identical.  Any bit of 
material that is a part of Lumpl is also a part of Goliath, and vice versa.  And according to 
a plausible principle, which we will call the principle of extensionality, if x and y share 
all their parts, x is identical to y.  Moreover, Lumpl and Goliath share all their parts at 
every moment in which they exist.  Since the destruction of the statue and the clay 
occurred almost immediately after they came into being, there was no time for the clay to 
chip or otherwise decrease in quantity.  If x and y share all their parts at every time that 
each exists, then x is identical to y.  Thus, Lumpl is identical to Goliath. 
But there are also compelling reasons to think that Lumpl and Goliath are not 
identical.  First, common sense tells us that they are not the same: statues and clay are 
different sorts of thing.  The statue may be made out of clay, but it is not the same thing 
as the clay.  Now, of course, common sense only goes so far.  If our philosophical theory 
is compelling enough, it may trump common sense.  And there are philosophical reasons 
to reject the claim that Lumpl and Goliath are identical.  According to Leibniz’s Law, if 
two objects are identical then there can be no property possessed by one of the objects 

 
 
 
182
that the second object fails to possess.  But it seems that there is such a property in the 
case of Lumpl and Goliath.  While Lumpl actually composes a statue, it could have been 
the case that Lumpl is a flower pot.  Goliath on the other hand, could not have been 
anything other than this statue.  As some philosophers like to put the matter, Lumpl and 
Goliath possess different “modal properties”.  For this reason Lumpl and Goliath are not 
identical.  
The puzzle of Lumpl and Goliath pits powerful philosophical principles against 
powerful intuitions about objects, their parts and their matter.  Abelard’s solution 
attempts to satisfy both sets of intuitions: Lumpl and Goliath are numerically the same, 
but they are different in property. 
Abelard first introduces the notion of sameness and difference in property in his 
Theologia Christiana.  In this discussion of the theory, he distinguishes the mode 
sameness and difference in property from the mode sameness and difference in 
definition.  In the Theologia Scholarium Abelard collapses the two modes into one.  The 
reason that Abelard collapses the two modes will be examined later.  The potential 
solution to the problem of material constitution, however, is derived from the earlier 
characterization of sameness and difference in property.  We will, hence, begin with the 
earlier account of this mode of sameness and difference.   
In the Theologia Christiana Abelard defines sameness in property in these terms 
(Theol. Chr. III §140, p. 247.1699-1703): 
One item is called the same as another when the property of the former 
participates in the latter, [and vice versa]—as the white thing [in that] of the hard 
thing and the hard [in that] of the white.  This is because the white thing 

 
 
 
183
participates in hardness, which is the property of the hard thing, and conversely 
the hard thing [participates in the property] of the white thing.   
 
Difference in property is immediately characterized in contrast to this description (ibid. 
pp. 247.1703-248.1707): 
Thus, there are some items that are the same in being, but different in properties: 
their properties remain thoroughly unmixed in such a way that the property of the 
former in no way participates in the latter, even though the substance of both 
items is the same in number. 
 
These characterizations indicate that a precondition for two items being the same or 
different in property is that the items be the same in being.  The distinction arises from 
the fact that the property of one item is “mixed” or “unmixed” with the property of the 
other item.  Abelard’s example of items which are the same in being, but whose 
properties remain altogether unmixed is that of a waxen image and the wax that 
materially composes it (ibid. p. 248.1707-1710):   
This wax (i.e. this matter) is the same in number as this waxen image (i.e. the 
materiatum).  Nevertheless, this matter here and the thing-made-of-matter 
(materiatum) do not share their properties. 
 
Abelard’s example makes it clear that it applies to all cases of artifacts constructed out of 
matter.  Hence, his description of the relation between the wax and the image made in it 
will carry over to Gibbard’s Lumpl and Goliath. 
In contrast to the wax and the image, a piece of chalk is both a hard thing (durum) 
and a white thing (album).  According to Abelard, the white and the hard items are the 
same in being—they share all the same parts—and they are the same in property, since 
their properties are thoroughly mixed.  This does not mean that the hard item and the 
white item are entirely indistinguishable.  According to the account in the Theologia 

 
 
 
184
Christiana, they are the same in property, but distinct in definition (III §142, 
pp.248.1740-249.1747): 
Among those that are called the same in being and in property, some are the same 
in definition—just as the sword and the blade, or Marcus and Tully.  The 
definition of these things is entirely the same, since not only is the sword a blade 
and the blade a sword, but from the fact that it is a sword, it is a blade, and vice 
versa.  Thus, they are to be altogether circumscribed (terminanda) by the same 
definition, since that which is expressed is the same, and the being of the former 
is that of the latter. 
 
The white item is not the same in definition as the hard item, because “items are different 
in definition if their meanings (sententiae) cannot be circumscribed by the same 
definition” (ibid. §154, p. 252.1875-76).  The point is about the states of being white 
versus being hard.  The definition of being hard does not also define being white, and 
vice versa.  In contrast, Abelard thinks that being a sword is defined by what it is to be a 
blade, and being a blade is defined by what it is to be a sword: “Not only is the sword the 
same as the blade in being, being a sword (esse ensem) is altogether the same as being a 
blade (esse mucronem)” (ibid. §143, p. 249.1767-69). 
Clearly sameness and difference in definition operates at the level of dicta or 
states-of-affairs.  It is less clear whether sameness and difference in property is also, 
roughly speaking, an ‘intensional’ mode of identity.  I believe that it is, but this must be 
demonstrated by clearing away some potential misconceptions surrounding the notions of 
property and participation.  First, it cannot be the case that the notion of property that 
Abelard is using aligns with his notion of form.  This is obvious from the fact that the 
white item is the same in property as the hard item.  Abelard admits that two forms 
supervene upon the chalk, whiteness and hardness, and he is careful not to claim that the 

 
 
 
185
form of hardness is the same as the form of whiteness.  More importantly, difference or 
sameness in property need not even be derived from the inherence of forms.  In two 
significant examples where two items are different in property, the difference is not 
derived from the inherence of forms.  First, Abelard argues that the Persons of the Trinity 
are the same in being but different in property.  But God is altogether without both parts 
and forms (Theol. Chr. III, § 166 and TSB II, c. i).  Second, Abelard famously 
distinguishes between a vox, which is the word construed solely as the physical breath of 
air, and a sermo, which is the word construed as the bearer of semantic content.  The vox 
and the sermo are the same in being and number, but they are different in property.  But 
again, the difference does not seem to stem from a difference in supervening forms (see 
4.1.3 above). 
We must also come to terms with the notion of “participation” and the 
corresponding notions of being “mixed” and “unmixed”.  By now it is clear that Abelard 
does not mean by “mixed” that two properties belonging to a thing are physically mixed 
together.  Rather, the phenomenon of mixed properties occurs when x and y are the same 
in being, x and y are distinguishable in virtue of different characteristics, and yet x and y 
are interpredicable.174  In the case of the white thing (album) and the hard thing (durum), 
the white thing and the hard thing are both just the chalk.  But the white thing is the 
chalk-as-white and the hard thing is the chalk-as-hard, and the white thing is 
interpredicable with the hard thing.  That is, we truthfully assert “the white thing is the 
hard thing” (album est durum).   
                                                 
174 On mixed properties and difference in property, compare my account to that of Brower (2004, 245-48). 

 
 
 
186
In contrast, the case where properties are unmixed occurs when x and y are the 
same in being, x and y are distinguishable from one another in virtue of different 
characteristics, but x and y are not interpredicable.  This is the case of Lumpl and 
Goliath.  ‘Lumpl is Goliath’ is ambiguous.  If ‘Lumpl is Goliath’ means that Lumpl and 
Goliath are the same in being, the statement is true.  But if the statement means that the 
materia (in this case the clay) is the materiatum (i.e. the statue), Abelard argues that it is 
false, because one cannot say ‘materia est materiatum’.  The explicit argument for the 
distinction between being different in property and being different in definition is an 
argument that appeals to a semantic phenomenon.  We do say ‘album est durum’, but we 
do not say ‘materia est materiatum’.  Abelard appears to take this linguistic phenomenon 
as a guide to the way the world is.  He does not think that the distinctions born out by 
these statements are merely matters of convention.175 
The three examples of items that are different in property—the vox and sermo, the 
Father and the Son, and the image and its matter—will in the end have different 
underlying analyses.  Abelard claims that the difference between the vox and the sermo, 
and the Father and the Son are analogous to the matter and the image, but he never claims 
anything stronger.176  When making these analogies Abelard suggests that the case of the 
image and its matter is the most intelligible example of two items that are different in 
                                                 
175 I make this distinction with confidence in the case of the matter and its materiate, and in the case of the 
Holy Trinity.  I will show why the matter/materiate case is about the world in what follows.  Abelard makes 
it clear in his treatment of the Trinity that the distinction between, e.g., the Father and the Son is not merely 
linguistic (in voce).  Those who hold that view are excoriated as heretics by Abelard.  Admittedly the 
distinction between the world and human convention is trickier when it comes to the third case of the 
vox/sermo. 
176 Statue : sermo :: stone : vox. (LNPS 522.22-25).  Cf. Wilks (1998, 373-76) and King (2004, 89-92). 

 
 
 
187
property.177  This suits our purposes well, since the problem of material constitution is 
what the mereologist cares about.  I will, thus, set aside the problem of the Trinity and the 
relation between the vox and sermo.  We must find out what it is about the world that 
makes it the case that the matter is different in property from the image. 
Let us return to the key passage concerning the image and its matter (Theol. Chr. 
III, § 140; p. 248.1707-14): 
For example, this wax is numerically the same as this waxen image—that is, the 
matter is [numerically the same as] the thing-made-material (materiatum).  
Nevertheless, this matter and the thing-made-material do not share their 
properties, since the matter of the waxen image is not a thing-made-material—i.e. 
this wax is not made from wax.  Nor is the thing-made-material matter—i.e. the 
waxen image is [not] matter belonging to a waxen image—since nothing of [the 
waxen image] is in any manner a constitutive part or naturally prior.178 
 
Abelard thinks that Lumpl and Goliath are numerically the same, which means he thinks 
that Lumpl and Goliath mereologically coincide.  Abelard, thus, appears to side with 
those who appeal to the principle of extensionality to show that Lumpl and Goliath are 
identical.  This indicates that the form that arises in the statue cannot be a part of Goliath. 
This does not mean that Goliath’s form has no role to play.  Abelard does not fall 
prey to the silly “aggregative” view attacked by Kit Fine.  Using an example of a ham 
                                                 
177 For example, in the Theologia Christiana (IV, §106, pp. 317-18), Abelard puzzles over this problem: 
The Father begets the Son.  The Father is God, and the Son is God.  But if God begets God, He either 
begets God himself or some other god.  Neither horn seems palatable; but Abelard claims that the puzzle is 
easily resolvable if one considers the analogy to the wax and the waxen image.  The difference between the 
wax and the waxen image is merely a difference in property, not in being.  The puzzle first assumes that it 
is problematic for something to beget another thing that is the same in being as itself; it offers as the 
exclusive alternative the possibility that the wax begets something that is different in being.  But in truth the 
wax begets something that is the same in being, but different in property.  The same holds true in the case 
of the puzzle of how the Father begets the Son.  The Father and Son are different in property.  In effect, 
Abelard assumes that once we understand that the Father and Son are analogous to the wax and the waxen 
image, the puzzle dissolves away. 
178 The text is difficult here:  cum videlicet nihil sui ipsius pars aliquo modo sit constitutiva aut naturaliter 
prius.  To make it intelligible I construe constitutiva with pars.

sandwich, Fine argues that according to the aggregative understanding of the sandwich, 
the sandwich just is the mereological sum of the ham plus the cheese plus the two slices 
of bread.  But the aggregative account does not suffice to account for that sum’s being a 
ham sandwich.  For instance, I could toss the sandwich across the room, scattering the 
ham and cheese and bread.  On the aggregative understanding the sandwich is still there, 
since the sum will exist whenever any of its components exist (Fine 1999, 62).  A further 
ingredient is required when giving an analysis of the ham sandwich.  There are the 
spatially located parts—the ham, the cheese, the lettuce and the two slices of bread—and 
there is also an additional part, the form, or as he calls it, “a trope of betweenness” (Fine 
1999, 63). 
For Abelard the arrangement can not be a part of the ham sandwich, because he 
explicitly states that the matter and the composite are the same in being and in number.  
Forms such as the form of the sandwich are not parts.  Rather, for Abelard, these types of 
form supervene upon parts when they are arranged.  The sandwich is not a composite of 
ham, cheese, bread plus an additional part—the sandwich form.179  Yet, while he refuses 
to consider Goliath’s form or the ham sandwich form to be parts of their respective 
objects, Abelard does acknowledge the importance of form when determining their states.  
Abelard would agree with Fine that when I toss the sandwich across the room, the 
sandwich ceases to be, even though the mereological sum remains.   
                                                 
179 For similar reasons, it is clear that for Abelard the soul is not a form.  The human being is a composite 
of a form and a body, where the form is a proper part of the composite.  It follows, then, that the soul is 
numerically distinct from the body; and the soul is neither numerically distinct from the composite nor 
numerically the same as the composite. 

 
 
 
189
Abelard’s refusal to hypostasize forms and hence draw a distinction between 
Lumpl and Goliath with respect to their essentiae, may at first seem confused.   Abelard 
claims that the matter is numerically the same as the thing-made-material, and yet the 
matter is naturally prior to the thing-made-material, and the thing-made-material is 
naturally posterior to the matter.  Furthermore, in the Logica Ingredientibus Abelard 
insists that the matter is prior in time to the shaped matter (Log. Ingr. 1, 79.9-10).  And in 
the Theologia Christiana Abelard insists that matter is sempiternal, whereas the 
composite is transitory (Theol. Chr. III, § 141; Theol. Chr. IV, §40; cf.  Dial. 418.36-37 
and 550.34-35).  How can something that is the same thing be ontologically prior and 
prior in time to itself?  It would seem that we must give separate ontological standing to 
the matter and to the composite in order to make sense of the fact that the properties of 
the matter and the thing-made-material remain unmixed.  But Abelard’s commitment to 
the supervenience of many forms upon their parts does not afford us the possibility of 
drawing an ontological distinction between matter and composite.   
The key is to remember that examples of Lumpl and Goliath, the waxen image 
and the wax, and the ham sandwich are examples of artifacts and their matter.  Artifacts 
are not substances, but are made out of substances.  The human act of constructing an 
artifact is not a case of substantial generation.  No new thing, Abelard insists, is created 
when we shape clay or bronze into a statue.  We merely rearrange the mereological sum 
that is the underlying thing.  Artifacts are not different things from their matter.  They 
are, nevertheless, distinguishable from their matter, because the statue is matter shaped as 
such-and-so.  In other words, the thing has taken on a new state. 

 
 
 
190
Natural priority is defined such that x is naturally prior to y if and only if when x 
is co-removed y, y is also co-removed; but when y is co-removed, x may remain (see 
3.2.2).  Suppose that we read this as an ontological claim.  It is uncontroversial that the 
statue can be destroyed, while the clay remains.  The statue is destroyed when the 
arrangement of the parts of the clay is changed.  We must, however, gloss what is meant 
when we claim that the statue is destroyed.  The destruction of the statue does not amount 
to the loss of a part, so this rearrangement of parts is not a change in being.  The 
arrangement, rather, entails that the thing takes on a new state.  Likewise, as I will argue 
in section 4.3, if the clay loses a part, then this statue is destroyed, since there has been a 
change of being.  Nonetheless, it is possible that another statue, with a similar shape, may 
exist after the loss of any part.  In other words, another mereological sum may possess the 
same state as the earlier statue. 
There is a striking similarity between certain contemporary solutions to the 
problem of Lumpl and Goliath and Abelard’s characterization of the relation between the 
two objects.  As I mentioned at the outset, one solution that is sometimes proffered in the 
case of Lumpl and Goliath is that they have different modal properties.  Abelard is, in a 
sense, also claiming that Lumpl and Goliath have different modal properties—i.e. priority 
and posteriority.  However, Abelard does not use this difference in the same way that 
contemporary philosophers use it.  Specifically, he does not use his analysis of difference 
in property in tandem with Leibniz’s Law to conclude that Lumpl and Goliath are not 
identical. 

 
 
 
191
One might be nervous about modal properties, especially if one has nominalist 
and naturalist leanings like Abelard.180  But for Abelard there is nothing mysterious 
lurking in these properties.  Certainly they are not forms which inhere in either the matter 
or the materiatum.  Rather priority and posteriority are shorthand for Abelard’s theory of 
the constitution of things.  The clay and the statue are the same mereological sum of 
atomic substances.  When we talk about the clay, we are talking about this sum 
considered as a lump of malleable stuff.  When we talk about the statue, we are not only 
considering the sum, we are talking about it as a sum with some particular arrangement 
imposed upon it, and thus we are talking about the thing in a certain state.  Thus, while 
the sum considered as clay is rearrangable, the sum as this statue is not rearrangable.  
Rearrangement of the sum would destroy the statue, since what it is to be this statue is to 
be this material arranged in this manner.  While Lumpl and Goliath are the same thing, 
they are distinct in another sense.  They are different because Lumpl could have been 
shaped into a flower pot, but the composite of clay and shape that is Goliath could not 
possess a different shape. 
Abelard’s characterization of difference in property appears to give us a nice 
solution to the problem of material constitution.  There is one worry, however, that must 
be raised.  Abelard’s understanding of the relation between matter and the things made 
from it requires that the characterization be restricted to artifacts.  Yet it is also true that 
substances are composites of matter and forms.  Does Abelard’s notion of being different 
                                                 
180 For a succinct summary of Abelard’s theory of modality, consult King (2004, 83-85).  In contrast to 
contemporary anti-realist strategies, Abelard aims to reduce de dicto modal statements to de re modal 
statements (idem. 116, note 61). 

 
 
 
192
in property have application as well to Socrates’ flesh in relation to Socrates, or the 
elemental parts of a plant to the plant?  If substantial differentiae are essentiae, as we 
claimed in section 4.1.2, then the answer may be ‘no’.  This would be especially true if 
substantial differentiae are parts, since the addition of a differentia to a bundle of 
elemental matter would then make something that is not the same in being as the matter 
by itself.  If a plant is different in being from its elemental matter, then the question 
cannot even arise whether the plant and its matter are the same or different in property.  
Likewise, for Abelard, the soul is a thing.  The Socrates who is a composite of body and 
soul is not the same in being as the body considered apart from the soul.  The question 
never even arises whether Socrates is the same or different in property from his matter.  
We will return to consider whether differentiae are indeed parts when we study the 
persistence of substances and person. 
One further puzzle bedevils Abelard’s account of sameness and difference in 
property.  When analyzed, difference in property seemed fairly intelligible.  The real 
puzzle is figuring out why something is the same in property as another.  Whiteness and 
hardness, whether they enjoy the status of being essentiae or whether they are 
supervenient, seem to qualify as distinct, identifiable forms.  If they are essentiae, then 
whiteness is different in being from hardness, just as the right hand is different in being 
from the left hand.181  If, as is more likely, they are not essentiae, it is true that whiteness 
is not hardness, even though the white thing is the same in being as the hard thing.  And 
indeed, this is why Abelard notes that they are different in definition.  But why are they 
                                                 
181 In both the Theologia Summi Boni and the Theologia Christiana Abelard states that forms can be 
numerically distinct from other forms (TSB II, iv; p. 146.854-60, and Theol. Chr. III, § 150, p.251).   

 
 
 
193
also not different in property?  The only answer seems to be that album and durum are 
interpredicable.  But leaving interpredicability as the ultimate explanation of sameness 
and difference is something we resisted above.182  The point can be put more strikingly if 
described in terms of states-of-affairs.  In the world, there is one thing.  Two forms 
supervene upon this thing, and hence there are two states-of-affairs, the thing being white 
and the thing being hard.  Compare this to the matter and its materiatum: there is also one 
thing, and (at least) two states of affairs, the thing being clay, and the thing being a statue.  
But according to Abelard, the white thing and the hard thing are the same in property, 
while the matter and the materiatum are different.  What is the difference, apart from 
interpredicability?   
Unfortunately, Abelard offers us little assistance in unraveling this new puzzle 
about sameness of property, and there is no obvious way to construct an answer using 
Abelardian principles.  There is a gap in Abelard’s theory, as it is presented in the 
Theologia Christiana, that he does not fill.  To be fair, this lapse is understandable, as his 
main interest is in difference in property.  It is the concept of difference in property that 
will help him resolve difficulties with the Trinity, and we must always remind ourselves 
that the Trinitarian dilemma is the true motivation for elaborating this new theory of 
identity.  Nevertheless, for those of us who are interested in the metaphysics of mundane 
objects, the lacuna in Abelard’s account is irksome. 
                                                 
182 Wilks insists that ‘album est durum’ is a clear case of essential predication, whereas ‘The Father is the 
Son’ and ‘Lumpl is Goliath’ are ambiguous whether they are essential or adjacent predications (1998, 370-
72).  To the contrary, I think that even ‘album est durum’ is ambiguous.  The ‘is’ needs to be interpreted, 
since ‘the white thing is the hard thing’ is true, if it means that the white thing is the same in being as the 
hard thing, and it is false, if it means that the white thing is the same in definition as the hard thing. 

 
 
 
194
This puzzle is perhaps the reason why Abelard proceeds to collapse the modes of 
sameness and difference in property, and sameness and difference in definition into one 
mode in his Theologia Scholarium (ThSch. II § 95, p. 454.1419-1422): 
Items are the same in property or definition when they are the same in number, 
and they do not differ in any of their properties or definitions—for example, the 
sword and the blade, the white and the bright, and other such univocal items. 
 
Difference in property and difference in definition is likewise collapsed (ibid. § 97, p. 
455.1440-1444): 
Items are different in property or definition if, with respect to their status, the 
proper characteristic (proprium) of this is one item and the proper characteristic of 
that is another, and each item is bounded by definitions that are unique and 
distinct in their sense (even if they are predicated of one another because they are 
the same in being). 
 
This collapse entails that both the white and the hard, and the statue and its matter are 
different in property, or (now) definition.  The puzzle why the white and the hard are the 
same in property now disappears.  It should be added that the collapse of these two 
modes into one does not compromise the previous analysis of the relation between Lumpl 
and Goliath.  It will still be the case that Lumpl and Goliath are the same in being, yet 
different in property (and now definition).  As presented in the Theologia Christiana, the 
question whether Lumpl and Goliath are different in definition would not even be raised, 
since it is a precondition for difference in definition that the items are the same in 
property.183 
                                                 
183 See Theol. Chr. III §142 (quoted above). 

 
 
 
195
4.2.3: Segue to problems of persistence and change 
Abelard offers an original and subtle theory of sameness and difference.  The 
theory allows Abelard to account for the complex relations that hold between a whole and 
its parts, and the relations that hold between part and part.  The theory also provides a 
defensible solution to the problem of material constitution, at least for the cases where the 
problem focuses upon the material constitution of artifacts. 
However, we must now understand what Abelard’s theory has not helped us to 
resolve.  The problem of the Many Socrateses is posed as a problem for a whole and its 
parts at a single moment of time.  In other words, it is a problem of synchronic sameness 
and difference.  But what about a slightly different puzzle, one which occurs through 
time?  Suppose Socrates is actually amputated at the wrist.  Is the sum of the one hand 
plus the rest really the very same Socrates who was there before?  Do the distinctions 
between sameness and difference in being help us untangle this puzzle?  The short 
answer is, “No.”  The modes of sameness and difference in being and number help us 
describe the situation, but they do not tell us the answer to what we are really after:  Is the 
sum of the one hand plus the rest the same person as the previous sum?   
Here I disagree with Calvin Normore, who suggests that Abelard’s theory of 
sameness and difference is designed in part to handle a puzzle about diachronic identity, 
the so-called “Growing Argument”: “Hence if Socrates loses a finger we no longer have 
the same essentia, though such a loss does not create numerical diversity and we do not 
have a different Socrates before and after.” (1992, 90)  Suppose for a moment that 
Normore is correct in thinking that sameness and difference in being, and numerical 

 
 
 
196
sameness and difference, can be extended to diachronic case studies.  Accordingly, when 
Socrates loses a finger, the essentia is no longer the same.  But Socrates’ essentia is not 
the same because the essentia-with-finger is not numerically the same as the essentia-
sans-finger.  But here is where things get difficult: In the synchronic case, where the 
finger is still attached, the two essentiae are not numerically different as well.  But, after 
the finger is removed, is the essentia-sans-finger numerically different from the previous 
essentia, or is it not numerically different?  The question is difficult, if not impossible to 
answer since there are no longer two essentiae to test for possible overlap.  There is only 
one essentia—the one which is the sum of nine fingers, two legs, a head, and so forth.   
Of course, what we are really after is the answer to whether Socrates survives or 
not.  Is the essentia-with-finger yesterday the same substance and the same person as the 
essentia-sans-finger today?  Abelard, we will see, does not think that being the same 
substance or being the same person is synonymous with being numerically the same.  The 
concept of an object’s essentia will retain its usefulness, but the details of sameness in 
substance and sameness in person are still forthcoming. 
Perhaps the mode of sameness and difference in property (or definition) will hold 
a key for unraveling Abelard’s theory of persistence.  This thought is initially attractive, 
and some elements from our previous discussion of difference in property surely suggest 
an avenue to developing a theory of diachronic identity.  But the problem of material 
constitution is not the problem of identity through change.  The case of the statue and its 
matter is not an example of a case where we are forced to consider whether something 
persists through a change, and especially whether it persists through a change in its 

 
 
 
197
parts.184  The puzzle of Lumpl and Goliath is set up so that at every time that Lumpl 
exists, Goliath exists.  There is no change such that there is a question whether either 
Lumpl or Goliath still exists. 
I also remind the reader of the caveat presented earlier: Lumpl and Goliath is a 
problem that concerns an artifact and its matter.  Despite many innovations, and the 
pressures that they put on the Aristotelian worldview, Abelard still explicitly clings to the 
distinction between substances and artifacts.  If elements derived from the concepts of 
sameness and difference in property (or definition) are to help us fill out a general theory 
of persistence, we will have to make sure that it also applies to substances. 
Thus, pace Normore, we should not presume that Abelard’s theory of synchronic 
identity readily translates to a theory of diachronic identity.  Much more must be done to 
understand Abelard’s theory of change and persistence. 
 
4.3: Persistence and change 
Abelard is tempted by the thesis that if any part is removed from a whole, this 
whole no longer exists.  This thesis appears to be embodied in Abelard’s commitment to 
the Principle of Mereological Constancy.  If Abelard indeed holds this thesis, he threatens 
to drain the world of many objects that common sense tells us exist.  It turns out that 
Abelard is not quite so extreme; although common sense does not escape unscathed.  In 
4.3.1 we will see that he does go beyond several benign interpretations of the Principle of 
Mereological Constancy.  In 4.3.2 we will see that Abelard rejects perdurantism, which in 
                                                 
184 The other key cases of items that are different in property—the Trinity and the vox/sermo—are also not 
cases of persistence through change. 

 
 
 
198
turn will only exaggerate Abelard’s commitment to mereological essentialism.  But in 
section 4.3.3 we will begin to rein Abelard in, and try to rescue some of the objects of 
common sense.  Here I will offer a reconstruction of Abelard’s theory of substantial 
persistence.  In section 4.3.4 I will examine Abelard’s remarks on personal identity. 
 
4.3.1: The Growing Argument 
Abelard claims, “No thing possesses more parts at one time than at another.”185  
For convenience I will call this thesis the Principle of Mereological Constancy.  This 
Principle is a central thesis in Abelard’s mereology, although it is initially unclear what 
the Principle expresses.  Specifically the Principle could be asserting the relatively weak 
claim that no mereological sum possesses more parts at one time than at another.  But 
mereological sums are not our paradigms of material objects.  Rather, when prompted to 
think about material objects, we typically call to mind more common sense items, like 
artifacts, rocks and organic bodies.  Houses and bodies are often said to have 
mereological sums as their matter, but the objects themselves are distinct from these 
mereological sums.  In particular, these objects are thought to differ from their matter, 
because common sense tells us that material objects can and do change parts.  Thus, it 
would be one thing to claim that no mereological sum has more parts at one time than 
another, it would be another, stronger, thing to claim that no material object possesses 
                                                 
185 Log. Ingr. 2, 300.21-22; cf. Dial. 423, 29-30.  D. P. Henry highlights this principle in his studies of 
Abelard’s mereology (see esp. 1972, 120).  Roderick Chisholm has picked up on Henry’s treatment of 
Abelard and quotes it as evidence from authority for his own thesis that parts are essential to their wholes 
(1976, 145).  As the reader will see, Abelard’s theory has much in common with Chisholm’s theory of 
mereological essentialism. 

 
 
 
199
more parts at one time than another.  I argue that Abelard’s Principle expresses the 
stronger claim that many material objects are mereologically constant, not just 
mereological sums.   
Abelard does not offer an explicit defense for the Principle that no material thing 
gains or loses parts.  We can, however, reconstruct an argument for this position by 
closely examining Abelard’s treatment of change in quantity.  There Abelard argues that 
no quantity grows or diminishes.  But it quickly becomes clear that Abelard is committed 
to something stronger than that.  Quantities are properties of mereological sums, and a 
change of quantity occurs only if the underlying sum is changed.  Thus, Abelard is 
committed to the claim that mereological sums do not grow or diminish.  And once some 
further Abelardian assumptions are made, the Principle is strengthened to include not 
only mereological sums, but also many of the material objects that are constituted out of 
these mereological sums.   
Abelard presents the problem of increase in his treatment of quantitative 
change.186  It seems, he argues, that nothing grows (Log. Ingr. 2, 299.19-30): 
If someone says that to grow is [for something] to be made greater than it was 
before by means of the addition of something, nothing appears to grow.  For there 
is nothing that seems to have become greater than it was previously by means of 
addition.  For example, if a fourth [stone] is added to three stones so that the pile, 
which was previously three stones, is said to have grown by the addition of the 
fourth, this appears to be not true.  This is because the pile of three stones, even 
after the addition of a fourth stone, is no greater with respect to its quantity than it 
was before.  It consists of three stones now, just as it did before.  There are no 
more parts than it possessed before.  For a similar reason the fourth stone, when 
                                                 
186 Change in quantity is one of four types of change: (1) substantial change, (2) quantitative change, (3) 
change in quality, and (4) change in location.  Abelard gets this four-fold distinction from Boethius, but as 
we will see in Abelard’s hands the distinction between substantial change and change in quantity appears to 
collapse.   

 
 
 
200
added, has not grown in any way, nor has the composite of three stones [grown] 
when the fourth is added.  Just as before, four stones now remain; there are not 
more [stones] than before.  
 
A similar argument is given in a parallel treatment of change in another of his works 
(Dial. 421.34-422.3): 
It does not appear that any augmentation comes to be in something by means of 
the addition of something, since nothing appears to increase.  For when something 
is attached to another it is not the case that the thing attached grows, nor does that 
thing to which [the other] is attached [grows], since it does not possess more parts 
than it did before.  Moreover, it does not appear that the thing that is composed 
out of these [two] has grown.  For [the composite] only retains those parts now 
which it had previously, namely the [part] that was attached and the [part] to 
which [the other] was attached. 
 
Abelard’s argument must be unraveled carefully.  Abelard first states a plausible 
definition of increase: some thing grows if and only if that very thing becomes greater in 
quantity than it was before by the addition of another thing.  The definition seems to 
accord with our common sense notion of growth.  We typically say that the pile of refuse 
grows every time that I throw trash onto it, and that Socrates’ waistline grows if he eats 
too many hamburgers.   
Abelard then tests this definition with a simple case.  We are to imagine a 
scenario where at a time labeled ‘before’, there were three stones a, b, c piled together 
into an integral collection.  In a different location, before, there is a fourth stone d.  At the 
point in time designated as ‘now’, the three stones have been brought into proximity with 
the fourth stone.   
Before:     {a + b + c}                             d 
Now:                       {a + b + c + d}  

 
 
 
201
Abelard asks, “What grows?”187  In the case of the four stones, there are three candidates: 
{a + b + c}, d, or {a + b + c + d}.  Abelard argues that none of the three candidates is 
that which grows.   
First, it cannot be the case that {a + b + c} grows.  Before, {a + b + c} just is the 
sum of a, b, and c.  Now, {a + b + c} is still just the sum of a, b and c.  So both before 
and now, {a + b + c} has the same quantity.  It is a pile of three stones before and a pile 
of three stones now.  But according to the proposed definition, if {a + b + c} grows this is 
because {a + b + c} now has a greater quantity than it did before.  That is, according to 
the proposed definition, if {a + b + c} is what grows, then {a + b + c} now has the 
quantity of a foursome.  Yet this is the quantity of {a + b + c + d}, not of {a + b + c}.  To 
assert that {a + b + c} has the quantity of a foursome is to confuse {a + b + c} with {a + 
b + c + d}.  {a + b + c} is a part of {a + b + c + d}, but the two piles are not identical.   
For similar reasons, it cannot be the case that d grows.  Both before and now, d 
has the quantity of a unit d.  To claim that d now possesses the quantity of a foursome 
would be to conflate d with {a + b + c + d}.  But of course, d is not identical to {a + b + 
c + d}.   
The third candidate perhaps has the strongest claim for being what grows.  But 
Abelard asserts that {a + b + c + d} also does not grow: “Just as before, four stones now 
remain; there are not more [stones] than before.” (Log. Ingr. 2, 299.30)  The argument is 
highly compressed, but it can be reconstructed as follows.  Consider the collection {a + b 
+ c + d} from two perspectives.  One can consider {a + b + c + d} in so far as it is a 
                                                 
187 Henry complains that Abelard fails to adequately identify the thing that grows (1972, pp. 120 and 128).  
I think, on the contrary, that Abelard does adequately answer the question: nothing grows.   

 
 
 
202
collection: “For [the composite] only retains those parts now which it had previously, 
namely the [part] that was attached and the [part] to which [the other] was attached.” 
(Dial. 422.1-3)  At the time labeled ‘before’ {a + b + c + d} existed as a scattered 
integral collection.  The only change that occurred from before to now is that {a + b + c + 
d} went from being a scattered integral collection to an aggregate whose parts are 
spatially proximate.  So before {a + b + c + d} was,  and now {a + b + c + d} is.  Yet, the 
sum composed out of stones a, b, c, and d has no greater quantity now than it had before.   
Consider {a + b + c + d} from a second perspective—that is, as an aggregate.  
As an aggregate {a + b + c + d} did not exist before.  {a + b + c + d} became an 
aggregate now.  But, once again, the phenomenon fails to meet the demands of the 
definition of growth.  As an aggregate {a + b + c + d} cannot be greater than it was 
before, because before the aggregate did not exist.  There is no one thing that was there 
prior to the addition of the extra stone and still there after the addition.  Therefore, no 
matter which perspective one chooses to privilege, {a + b + c + d} does not grow.   
Since none of the three candidates grows, it follows that nothing grows.  It should 
be fairly obvious that a similar argument could be run for the phenomenon of decrease, or 
diminution.   
Abelard takes these arguments to apply universally to quantities.  And, at first 
glance, it may seem that Abelard’s treatment of increase only applies to quantities—
which are accidents that inhere in subjects—but not to the subjects themselves.  That 
Abelard addresses the problem under the heading of change in quantity does nothing to 
dispel this impression.  If this is the case, Abelard’s treatment of increase is trivial.  Of 

 
 
 
203
course, a quantity can never be more or less than it is.  A twosome can never be more or 
less than two things; five grams can never be more or less than five grams.  But it does 
not follow from this fact that the things that possess quantities cannot increase or 
decrease.   
But when one carefully reexamines the argument, the manner in which Abelard 
uses the example of the pile of stones makes it clear that quantities cannot increase or 
decrease, because the subjects that possess these quantities cannot increase or decrease.  
The quantities of the piles are determined by enumerating the parts.  {a + b + c + d} is 
greater in quantity than {a + b + c} because it has more stones.  This analysis of the piles 
of stones is consistent with Abelard’s general understanding of the category of quantity.  
Abelard asserts that unit quantities are accidents of unit subjects.  As the reader will recall 
from above (4.1.2), points are the smallest units of corporeal quantity; and each point 
inheres in “an indivisible subject”, which Abelard identifies as the “singular indivisible 
parts of a body” (Dial. 57.15-16).  Something will be greater in quantity than another 
because the former will possess more indivisible subjects than the latter.  To be more 
exact, a quantity belongs to a mereological sum of indivisible parts, and one quantity will 
be larger than another because the former sum has more parts than the latter sum.  Thus, 
the gain or loss of quantity supervenes upon the gain or loss of the indivisible parts that 
are the subjects for quantity.  But, as the example of the stones illustrates, if a 
mereological sum gains or loses a part, it no longer exists.  The mereological sum of a, b, 
c, and d may become aggregated or scattered, but it can never be anything other than the 
sum of a, b, c, and d.  The sum of a, b, and c is an altogether different mereological sum.  

 
 
 
204
(More precisely, {a + b + c} is different in being from {a + b + c + d}.)  If d were not 
merely scattered, but annihilated, the sum of a, b, c, and d would be destroyed.   
Therefore, the Principle of Mereological Constancy holds not only for quantities, 
it universally holds for the mereological sums that are the subjects of these quantities.  
Nonetheless, Abelard acknowledges that something appears to grow, and he attempts to 
explain this appearance.  At first Abelard seems to settle on this analysis: growth occurs 
when parts that were once scattered are brought together into the same place (Dial. 423.4-
10): 
As we have said, no part increases in the constitution of something; rather the 
composite increases with respect to its components, since the whole contains that 
which each part comprehends, and in addition whatever any of the other parts 
contains.  Therefore, some composite increases when it possesses more parts in 
some place than it previously had in the same location; and decrease [occurs when 
the composite] has fewer parts [in the same location] than before.  
 
Abelard’s example illustrates this proposed analysis (Dial. 423.13-16): 
For example, suppose there are two men, one inside the house and the other 
outside.  In relation to each other these two men are one composite.  Now if the 
man outside is drawn inside, the same composite has more parts inside the house 
than it did before, but there are not more parts than there were before. 
 
According to this proposal, our heap of stones {a + b + c + d} increases because before 
{a + b + c + d} was scattered—i.e. {a + b + c} was here and d was there—but now, {a + 
b + c} and d are both here.  Nevertheless, {a + b + c + d} had no fewer and no greater 
number of parts before than it does now.  
Interestingly, Abelard does not appear to be entirely satisfied with this account 
(Dial. 423.18-28 my emphasis): 
However, understanding increase as a conjunction and gathering [of parts] at a 
place violates not only use, but authority...  Hence, when we say, ‘if something is 

 
 
 
205
added to another, the whole is made greater’, it should not be understood that a 
composite was made greater than it was before, but rather that [the composite] 
was made greater than each of the parts through the addition of any one of these.  
For the composite did not exist before.  And if other parts, which existed before, 
are taken, there will not be a decrease in the number of these.  The parts were the 
same apart from the conjunction as they were within the conjunction.  Hence, the 
increase is not a comparison of the composite to itself, but of the whole to each of 
its parts. 
 
What Abelard seems to have done here is switch from the first way of considering the 
problem of increase with respect to our heap, {a + b + c + d}, to the second way of 
considering the heap.  Recall that from the second perspective nothing seems to increase, 
since the aggregate {a + b + c + d}, which exists now, did not exist before (even though 
the collection of those very parts did exist before).  Now Abelard proposes that the 
phenomenon of increase is really a comparison of the quantity of the product of 
aggregation compared to the quantity of the original components.  There is increase 
because now the four stones have been brought together into the same location to form 
the aggregate {a + b + c + d}, and this aggregate has a greater number of parts than either 
of the original, non-aggregated components, {a + b + c} or d.  Nonetheless, the number 
of stones was four before and still is four now.   
This revised account has two important components.  First, it is crucial that {a + b 
+ c} and d are parts of {a + b + c + d} in order to have a “proper” instance of increase 
(Dial. 422.26-29): 
But if someone understood increase in terms of a greater measure in dimension, 
so that some larger man is said to increase with respect to a smaller man, this 
person understands increase in a very improper manner. 
 
It would be inappropriate to compare {a + b + c} to another heap {e + f} and conclude 
that {a + b + c} increased.  Second, spatial proximity of the parts, or the process of 

 
 
 
206
aggregation, plays a central role.  Strictly speaking mereological sums do not increase or 
decrease.  They appear to increase and decrease because the parts of a sum can be 
scattered and aggregated.  Increase occurs when things are brought into the same location 
and the number of parts at that location is thereby greater than the number that was there 
previously.  Decrease occurs when the number of parts at a location is made less by 
scattering one or more of the original aggregate’s parts. 
The current analysis of increase is unsatisfactory, because it fails to capture a 
crucial element of the phenomenon of increase.  The initial, common-sense definition of 
increase required that it is the same thing that increases or decreases.  We now know that 
no mereological sum increases or decreases in this manner.  But when we think about 
increase, we typically do not think of mereological sums; we think about paradigmatic 
material objects.  Consider once more Fine’s example of a ham sandwich.188  A ham 
sandwich only exists when the bread and ham are arranged such that the ham is placed 
between the two slices of bread.  Suppose I toss the sandwich across the room, scattering 
its parts.  The sum of the ham and bread is now scattered, as the present analysis of 
decrease requires, but we do not think that this is a case of decrease.  Rather, this is a case 
where the sandwich no longer exists.  Suppose, however, I pick off a sliver of the meat 
from the edge of the ham.  Intuitively, it is the sandwich, and not some collection of 
objects at a place, that has decreased.   
Abelard’s current account of increase and decrease misses the fact that we tend to 
identify the thing that increases and decreases by means of a form or structure, not by 
                                                 
188 As the reader will remember from section 4.2.2, Fine uses the example to a slightly different end (1999, 
62-63).   

 
 
 
207
counting material bits that are present at some particular location.  In paradigmatic cases 
of increase, the underlying intuition is that one and the same thing increases.  It is my 
ham sandwich that increases if I add some cheese, and it is my ham sandwich that 
decreases when I bite into it.  The preliminary analysis of increase does not adequately 
preserve this intuition.189  Fortunately, Abelard offers another analysis of the 
phenomenon in his second treatment of the problem.190  Again, strictly speaking the 
mereological sum does not increase or decrease, but something falling under a proper sort 
does (Log. Ingr. 2, 299.30-40):  
Perhaps [the problem] can easily be resolved if we say that some thing grows 
when, after the addition of something else, it carries over to the sort of composite 
(transit in tale compositum) that does not recede from the nature or property of 
[the original].  For example, if some water is added to water, the water to which 
there is the addition carries over to some composite that is also called ‘water’.  
Similarly if a fourth stone is added to three stones, the pile of three stones is said 
to grow in so far as [the original pole of three] carries over to a greater pile of 
stones by means of the addition of the fourth stone.  This greater second pile, just 
as the previous pile, is a pile of stones.  But if a piece of wood is added to the 
three stones, the pile of stones is not said to grow, nor do the stones, since the 
whole taken together [sc. {the three stones + the piece of wood}] is neither stones 
nor a pile of stones.  
 
Abelard’s new characterization of increase can be characterized as follows: 
X-as-an-F increases if and only if before X is an F, and after the addition of some 
y {X + y} now is an F. 
 
                                                 
189 Curiously, D. P. Henry thinks that what I identify as the initial theory is Abelard’s second, more 
considered answer (1972, 120).   I am arguing that it is the other way around.  
190 Even in the first analysis of increase Abelard indicates some awareness that his first account is 
inadequate (Dial. 423.32-424.2).  However, he does not adjust his account of increase to accommodate the 
worry about structured wholes until he treats the problem a second time in the Logica Ingredientibus.  I 
should stress that by labeling the two accounts of increase as the ‘first’ and ‘second’, I do not intend to 
suggest that one account has an early date than the other.  I have no views concerning the relative dating of 
the two treatises.  I favor the account in the Logica for philosophical reasons.  Constant Mews dates the two 
works as roughly contemporary to one another (1985, 130-32). 

 
 
 
208
Based on this new account {a + b + c}-as-a-pile-of-stones increases, if another stone is 
added.  Before {a + b + c} was a pile of stones.  Now {a + b + c} “carries over” to {a + 
b + c + d} (i.e. {a + b + c} is a proper part of {a + b + c + d}), and {a + b + c + d} is 
also a pile of stones.  In contrast, {a + b + c}-as-a-pile-of-stones does not increase if one 
adds a piece of wood, since even though {a + b + c} is a proper part of {a + b + c + the 
piece of wood}, {a + b + c + the piece of wood} is not a pile of stones. 
Abelard admits that in some sense, even if one adds a piece of wood to {a + b + 
c}, {a + b + c}-as-something increases (Log. Ingr. 2, 299.40-300.4): 
Perhaps, then, the pile grows, since what is prior and what is made from that [are 
both] called a pile.  But if a stone is conjoined to a man, or a man to a stone, for a 
similar reason neither the man nor the stone is said to have grown, which indeed 
would have been the case, <if> the composite [of the man and stone] could be 
called ‘stones’ or ‘men’.191 
 
If Cicero were added to the integral collection {Plato + Socrates} the group of men would 
increase.  If a horse were added to {Plato + Socrates}, the group of men would not 
increase, but perhaps the group of animals would increase (Log. Ingr. 2, 300.4-8).  
Abelard’s example of the integral collection formed out of a man and a stone seems to 
indicate that as the sortal ‘F’ becomes more general, our intuitions that something 
increases becomes weaker.  In the limit case we are hesitant to claim that a pile of things 
increases. 
Notice that this new account of increase applies only to aggregates and more 
complex material wholes; and even for aggregates the analysis is somewhat shaky.  This 
                                                 
191 quod si lapis homini vel homo lapidi coniungatur, nec homo neque lapis simili ratione crevisse dicitur, 
quod quidem esset, <si> compositum vel lapides vel homines dici posset.  Geyer correctly surmises that 
something must be added.  His addition captures the sense of the argument. 

 
 
 
209
sortal-based account of increase will not make sense in the case of mereological sums 
when they are considered as collections.  If the scattered sum {Peter Abelard + the Queen 
of France} were brought closer together, the sum would not increase.  Likewise, if 
Abelard and the Queen were placed on different hemispheres of the Earth, the sum would 
not decrease.  Annihilating either Abelard or the Queen will not cause an increase or 
decrease of the mereological sum.  Rather, the annihilation of either member of the sum 
entails the destruction of the sum itself. 
The analysis works somewhat better in the case of aggregates.  Strictly speaking, 
the pile of stones {a + b + c + d} does not decrease if d is removed, since the 
mereological sum of those stones still exists.  We might say that, as an aggregate, {a + b 
+ c + d} ceases to be, and the aggregate {a + b + c} comes into being.  But since simple 
aggregates are merely collections that are brought into spatial proximity, it would be 
more precise to say that before the mereological sum of a, b, c, and d was aggregated, 
and now that same sum is scattered.  The decrease of a pile of stones occurs when the 
sum of the stones was aggregated into a pile beforehand, but now the aggregated sum {a 
+ b + c} is a proper part of the mereological sum of a, b, c and d and this aggregated sum 
{a + b + c} is also a pile of stones. 
Abelard’s new account of increase works best for things that fall under either 
some natural kind or some artifact sortal.  Consider, again, the ham sandwich, since this 
undermined Abelard’s previous account of increase and decrease.  The ham sandwich 
increases when I add a slice of cheese, because the mereological sum of the parts now 
aggregated together possesses the previous aggregated mereological sum of sandwich 

 
 
 
210
parts as a proper part, this new aggregated sum is greater than the old aggregated sum, 
and this new aggregated sum is also a ham sandwich.  When the sandwich is tossed 
across the room, no decrease occurs because the sum, while scattered, has no proper part 
that is still a ham sandwich.  And the ham sandwich decreases when I take a bite out of it, 
because the new aggregated sum is smaller than the old one, yet it still is a ham 
sandwich.  When the aggregated mereological sums persist as ham sandwiches, this is 
due to the fact that the parts belonging to that sum are arranged in the proper way.  
Hence, the new account of increase and decrease is preferable for philosophical reasons.   
At this point in the argument, it now seems that the new Abelardian analysis of 
increase is the following: The Principle of Mereological Constancy expresses the claim 
that a mereological sum cannot have fewer or greater parts.  A thing appears to increase 
because it trades in a smaller mereological sum for a bigger mereological sum—that is, 
the thing increases because its matter increases.  Hence, one can safely say that 
mereological sums never have more or less parts, but still insist that an artifact can often 
have different mereological sums over the span of its existence.192  But if that is all that 
Abelard’s analysis amounts to, he still is not claiming anything distinctive.  Many 
philosophers admit that mereological sums are essentially dependent upon their parts, and 
yet they insist that a structured material object can possess different mereological sums 
and still be the very same object.193 
                                                 
192 Many of Abelard’s contemporaries express this very point—e.g. Pseudo-Joscelin (De generibus et 
speciebus §§22 and 26), and Introductiones Montani maiores (fols. 72ra-rb).  See next chapter, section 
5.1.2. 
193 For instance, see Simons (1987, 245-6 and 272-80) and Van Cleve (1986, 147).  Usually, but not 
always, these philosophers hold a strong version of the form-matter theory.  Simons generally tries to avoid

Here is where Abelard’s thesis says something bold.  Abelard’s Principle of 
Mereological Constancy applies to artifacts, and not just the matter of artifacts.  While 
the existence of these boards and these stones is not sufficient for the existence of this 
house, their existence is necessary.  Consider this passage concerning the relation 
between a house and its parts (Dial. 550.33-36): 
But perhaps it can be said that, when this stone is removed and exists by itself 
apart from the conjunction of the house, this house (which existed previously) 
[still] exists –i.e. this stone and what were parts with it exists.  (For it is 
impossible for the substance of body to be annihilated.)   
 
Abelard’s imagined interlocutor is offering a particularly astute objection.  When a stone 
is removed from the house, the mereological sum composed of that stone and all the other 
parts of this house still exists.  Abelard’s liberal policy towards collections forces him to 
acknowledge this fact.  The anonymous objector is now asking whether Abelard is 
thereby committed to the identification of this house with this now scattered mereological 
sum.  The opponent’s objection would go through if Abelard were committed to the 
claim that material objects were identical to their mereological sums.  In the same 
passage, immediately preceding his opponent’s remarks, Abelard seems to assert just 
that: “For this house is nothing other than this stone and all the other parts at once.” 
(Dial. 550.11-12) 
The opponent correctly assumes that Abelard’s principle about the mereological 
constancy of wholes applies to objects other than mereological sums.  But in addition, the 
                                                                                                                                                 
sounding Aristotelian, but he nonetheless ends up appealing to form as a principle of individuation and 
identity over time when presenting his solution to the Ship of Theseus (1987, 199-209). 

 
 
 
212
opponent assumes that the existence of the mereological sum is sufficient for the 
existence of the house.  Abelard denies this stronger assumption (Dial. 550. 36-551.4): 
We don’t deny this; but it is not the case that this house [now] exists.  Those 
things cannot be called ‘this house’ when the composition of a house is removed.  
Nor [is it true] that in order for this house to exist it suffices that the matter exists.  
These boards and stones cannot yet be called this house before fabrication.  The 
composition characteristic of a form is necessary.  Therefore, it does not follow 
that if these stones and boards exist, this house exists.  They only persist [as a 
house] because of the composition that is in the disposition of the parts. 
 
The existence of the mereological sum does not entail the existence of this house.  The 
structure of a house must be present in the parts.   
In the case of artifacts, the form cannot be the principle of persistence.  The 
existence of the mereological sum is a necessary condition for the existence of the artifact 
because it is also a necessary condition for the existence of the artifact’s form.  Abelard 
denies that this house exists once it loses a stone.  Abelard thinks this is true because of 
this additional premise (Dial. 551.4-6): 
This composition, since it belongs to all the parts at once, necessarily changes if 
any part is removed. 
 
The arrangement of the house supervenes upon the parts.  When the parts are altered, the 
arrangement is also altered.  The new arrangement might also be that of a house, but this 
new arrangement is not the very same arrangement as before.  The arrangement, 
therefore, cannot preserve the identity of this house.  In other words, Abelard subscribes 
to the weak version of the form-matter theory, not the traditional strong version.194  An 
                                                 
194 Further evidence that this is indeed Abelard’s view can be gleaned from a work by one of his Nominalist 
followers.  When describing the thesis that “nothing grows”, this anonymous author insists that, “Every 
subtraction or addition of a part and every transposition of parts changes the being of the whole.” (Ebbesen 
1991, 438; reproduced in Ebbesen 1992, 70) 

 
 
 
213
artifact essentially changes when a part is lost, gained, and even when the sum is 
rearranged.195  Since the form of the artifact changes when parts are gained or lost, an 
artifact strictly speaking cannot persist through the change of parts.  The Principle of 
Mereological Constancy holds for artifacts, and not just for the matter of artifacts.   
Abelard’s Principle of Mereological Constancy is rightfully famous, or infamous, 
because of what it entails about the nature and persistence of material objects.  I started 
with the simple claim that no quantity shrinks or grows.  Because quantities are accidents 
of mereological sums, it quickly follows that strictly speaking no mereological sum 
shrinks or grows, because no mereological sum can gain or lose parts and remain the 
same sum.  It seemed at first that the claim that mereological sums are mereologically 
constant is all that Abelard holds.  His Principle when interpreted as such is compatible 
with a strong form-matter theory of material particulars.  But in the case of artifacts, 
Abelard rejects the strong form-matter theory, and opts for the weak version instead.  
Once this fact is made plain, it follows that Abelard’s Principle of Mereological 
Constancy applies to material objects such as houses, statues and chairs, and not just to 
the matter of these objects.  Abelard is committed to the distinctive claim that strictly 
speaking no artifact has more or less parts now than it did before.   
Recall that Abelard draws a line between artifacts and substances (4.1.2).  
Artifacts are the products of human accidental manipulation of substances.  Humans do 
not generate artifacts, since generation is reserved for the activities of Nature and 
                                                 
195 Compare Van Cleve’s three grades of mereological essentialism (1986, 141).  Van Cleve thinks that it is 
true that the whole is destroyed if a part is lost or added (grades 1 and 2), but he denies that the whole is 
destroyed when the parts are merely rearranged (grade 3) (idem. 144). 

 
 
 
214
ultimately God.  Artifacts do not persist through the change of accidents since any change 
in an accidental form suggests an underlying change in the arrangement of the parts of 
the artifact’s being.  But the substances that make up these artifacts—e.g. the clay, stone, 
and wood—may have a different set of persistence conditions.  Abelard follows Aristotle 
and claims that substances are the sorts of things that can persist through the change of 
accidents (Dial. 54.35-55.9; Log. Ingr. 2, 160.31-33).  Perhaps, then, substances are not 
mereologically constant. 
Before turning to the identity and persistence of substances with respect to their 
parts, I must address a question that some contemporary readers have been impatiently 
thinking for quite some time.  Namely, some contemporary metaphysicians might be 
wondering why Abelard fails to consider the possibility that objects have not only three-
dimensional parts, but also temporal parts. 
 
4.3.2: No temporal parts 
One common attempt to avoid the extremism of mereological constancy is to 
argue that brooms, cars, and even cats are actually four-dimensional objects (see 2.5).  
This broom is not merely a sum of such spatial parts as this handle and these hairs.  
Rather it is a sum of spatio-temporal parts.  Roughly speaking, the handle and hairs are 
parts of a “time slice”, or “temporal part”, of the broom, and the broom itself is a 
mereological sum of these temporal parts. 
The four-dimensionalist theory attempts to resolve the puzzle of persistence, but 
not by directly answering Abelard’s question of what is increased or decreased.  Instead 

 
 
 
215
the four-dimensionalist redescribes the event.  The pile does not increase or decrease.  
The bigger pile and the smaller pile are merely two temporal parts of one temporally 
stretched out object, the four-dimensional pile.  In short, the addition or loss of a spatial 
part is no longer an event that threatens to undermine the integrity and existence of a 
whole.  Four-dimensionalism does not ignore the problem of persistence, but it does 
redefine the phenomenon so that there is no longer a question of whether something 
persists through time and change of parts.   
For Abelard, the four-dimensionalist solution is not an option.  As I have already 
noted in chapter 2, many of the ontological presuppositions of four-dimensionalism are 
alien to Abelard (2.5).  Abelard accepts the Aristotelian supposition that time is an 
accident of substances.  This orientation towards substances naturally lines up with a 
form of endurantism.  I also pointed out in chapter 2, the metaphysical assumptions 
behind endurantism do not easily line up with four-dimensionalism.  This is especially 
true once we add the fact that Abelard is clearly a presentist. 
I claim that presentism and endurantism do not easily square with the view that 
artifacts and other objects are sums of temporal parts.  But the two are not necessarily 
incompatible.  Chisholm, for instance, argues that artifacts are what he calls “entia 
successiva” (1976, 97).196  That is, strictly speaking, the broom is subject to the principle 
of mereological constancy, and hence any loss of a hair entails the destruction of that 
                                                 
196 Persons are entia per se, and hence not subject to mereological essentialism.  Chisholm’s arguments for 
the substantiality of persons are not mereological; they rely on the unity of subjective experience (idem, 
140 ff.). 

 
 
 
216
broom.197  But in a looser and more popular sense, what we call “the broom” is really a 
successive string of these mereologically constant objects.  In short, the entia successiva 
that we loosely call the broom has a type of temporal part, since changes in parts occurs 
over time, and accordingly each mereological constant member of the string that is the 
broom is a time-indexed part.198  
The reader should note the similarities between Chisholm’s account and the 
account of artifacts I have attributed to Abelard.199  Perhaps Abelard also thinks that 
artifacts are sums of temporal parts in this sense.  But for reasons that I will now explore, 
Abelard will not accept that entia successiva composed of temporal parts are real, for 
Abelard rejects the reality of wholes whose parts exist in succession.  At best, he insists, 
successive wholes are philosophers’ fictions. 
Abelard’s examples of wholes whose parts exist in succession are times and 
speech (oratio).  Most of his remarks occur in his discussion of the Aristotelian quantity 
of time, but he explicitly mentions speech in a key passage on successive wholes (Dial. 
553.8 ff.), and it will be easy to show that Abelard’s analysis of time carries over to the 
analysis of speech.   
                                                 
197 Chisholm holds that the existence of a material particular depends upon the existence of its parts: “For 
every x and y if x is ever part of y, then y is necessarily such that x is part of y at any time that y exists.” 
(1976, 149; cf. Chisholm 1989, 66).  Van Cleve also holds that something like the Principle of 
Mereological Constancy applies to sums, artifacts and non-living material objects.  He makes exceptions 
for organisms and persons (1986, 147 ff.). 
198 In his earlier writings, Chisholm insists that things do not have temporal parts (1976, 139-44).  But in his 
last treatment of metaphysics, he clarifies his position, insisting that the parts of entia successiva are entia 
per se and endure through time, whereas the things they make up have by definition something like 
temporal parts (1996, 93).    
199 I will have more to say about this point in chapter 6, but I think Abelard clearly anticipates Chisholm.  
In fact, I think that Abelard’s analysis of change and persistence superior is to Chisholm’s. 

 
 
 
217
Let me make some preliminary remarks about times and speech in turn.  Some 
commentators use the term ‘temporal whole’ when discussing Abelard’s treatment of 
time.  But the times that Abelard is specifically considering must be kept distinct from the 
temporal wholes that are the subjects of contemporary metaphysics.  (Hence, I will use 
the clumsy term ‘times’ instead of ‘temporal wholes’.)  Abelard is talking about the 
Aristotelian category of time, and in particular he is focusing upon durations such as 
hours, days, and weeks.  He is not talking about times as dates, as these temporal items 
more precisely fall under the Aristotelian category of “when”.  The hours and days, 
which are the focus of Abelard’s remarks, are the measured durations of substances (Log. 
Ingr. 2, 184.30-34).200  But for what presently follows I suggest that this fact is not very 
helpful.  Indeed, it may prove to be a red herring if we are not careful.  Abelard’s and his 
unnamed opponents are both considering the possibility whether the quantity of the 
duration itself can be an integral whole.  What Abelard concludes about the status of 
times will have ramifications for his views about the possibility of successive wholes in 
the category of substance, but one must not think that Abelard is directly addressing the 
contemporary four-dimensionalist’s proposal that perduring substances are mereological 
sums of time slices.   
By speech Abelard means the physical noises made by a mouth.  Since speech is 
measured by short and long syllables, Abelard considers them to be quantities.  The 
comparison between times and speeches (as I will call individual instances of spoken 
                                                 
200 See King (2004, 101), and Henry (1990, 139).  Abelard actually says that a quantity of time is the 
duration of existence of “anything whatsoever”.  But since in the Aristotelian framework everything tends 
to boil down to substances and their properties, we can safely focus upon times as durations of substances. 

 
 
 
218
sounds) is instructive.  The underlying subjects of the short and long syllables that 
compose the quantity of a speech are actual puffs of air.  The ephemeral quality of 
syllables, and hence the speech as a whole, is due to the fact that these puffs come in 
succession and quickly pass out of existence.  In contrast, the connection between a time 
and its subject is not so obvious.  Abelard is a presentist, so only the present exists.  The 
past was and is now no longer, and the future will be but is not yet.  But it does not 
immediately follow that Abelard believes in something like mereological occassionalism.  
By mereological occasionalism I have roughly this thesis in mind: brooms and cats don’t 
exist.  Rather the broom-at-t1 and the cat-at-t1 exist at t1, and when t1 no longer is, these 
objects also cease to exist, substituted immediately with the broom-at-t2 and the cat-at-t2.  
I think this view is utterly alien to Abelard, who is in favor of endurantism.  This was all 
assumed previously in the discussion of the problem of increase.  The stones endured 
through time.  The question was whether the thing composed out of these stones could 
survive the loss or addition of further parts (which also endure in their own right).  
Abelard, like his master Aristotle, thinks that time is dependent upon substances.  To 
think that Abelard’s presentism reveals something directly about the status of the subjects 
of the things that are present is to reverse the direction of dependency. 
I do not mean to suggest that the Aristotelian approach to temporality is safe from 
reproach.  Nor will I propose to examine carefully Abelard’s theory of the how times are 
related to their subjects.201  But this much can be said: Abelard’s Aristotelian assumptions 
                                                 
201 The most notable difficulty with Abelard’s theory of time as an accident is his claim that each thing has 
its own duration, and hence its own time.  Abelard attempts to reconcile this implication with the 
commonplace that there is only one time for the world as a whole.  For a discussion of these issues and 
Abelard’s solution, consult King (2004, 101-102). 

 
 
 
219
make it so that an analysis of persistence must deemphasize the temporal aspect of the 
puzzle in favor of the changes to the subject.  I have already attempted to do just this in 
my study of Abelard’s problem of increase.  The puzzle was over mereological change—
i.e. the addition and removal of essentiae.  In general, Abelard’s approach to persistence 
will proceed in this manner: focusing upon the essentiae and properties of wholes, not 
upon their path through time.  Persistence will never be framed in terms of re-
identification over time, but rather in terms of re-identification through changes in 
essentiae and property. 
One other fact about speeches should be noted as a preliminary matter.   If I utter 
‘There’ but am stopped before I can complete the speech, ‘There is a dog’ never did exist.  
We can only judge that the whole ‘There is a dog’ existed after the speech has come into 
existence and gone out of it.  The same is in fact true for a day.  Should God annihilate 
the universe during the first hour, the day never existed.  A time did exist, just as a speech 
(namely, ‘There’) existed, but the day never existed since it never was completed.  
Abelard’s discussion of times often conceals this fact, but this is not fatal to his 
enterprise.  We can charitably assume that cases of days cut short by the act of God as 
well as incomplete speeches have implicitly been put to one side, just as houses that were 
left half built are also implicitly put aside.  The comparison is between completed integral 
wholes and completed days and speeches.  In fact, Abelard is well aware of the fact that 
speeches and times are only judged to be whole ex post facto.  This fact is a crucial part 
of his explanation of the status of times and speeches, which I will address shortly. 

 
 
 
220
Here ends my preliminary remarks about the special properties of times and 
speeches.  I must emphasize these crucial points.  Abelard is considering the proposal that 
a quantity of time as such, or a quantity of spoken sound as such, is an integral whole.  
But for our purposes, times and speeches are test cases for a larger claim about the nature 
of wholes, namely whether any integral whole can exist whose parts exist successively.  
Abelard’s answer to this broader question, not his view of time in particular, will explain 
why the theory of temporal parts is anathema to his metaphysics of mereology and 
persistence.  
As Abelard reports it, some thinkers call times and speeches integral wholes, even 
though they have very different properties from other integral wholes.  It is agreed by 
these thinkers that other integral wholes follow these rules: 
(a) If the whole exists, necessarily all the parts exist. 
(b) If any part does not exist, necessarily the whole does not exist. 
(c) If one part exists, it is not necessary that the whole exists. 
 
The reader can see that these rules are all derived from a strict reading of Boethius’ 
proclamation that the parts are naturally prior to their whole (see 3.2.2 and 3.3.4).  
Abelard has already made use of these rules in his argument for mereological constancy.  
Now Abelard contrasts the behavior of other integral wholes, with wholes whose parts 
proceed in succession.  His explicitly mentions times (Dial. 553.12-15):202 
For this [type of] whole in contrast to other integral [wholes] the opposite is said 
to hold: namely, any one of its parts entails the [existence of] the whole, and the 
destruction of the whole destroys each and every one of its parts.  For example, if 
the first [part of the day] exists, the day is said to exist as well.  And accordingly 
if the day did not exist, it would also be asserted that the first part does not exist. 
 
                                                 
202 The same observations are also made at Dial. 62.38-63.6 and Log Ingr. 2, 187.3-7. 

 
 
 
221
Thus, in contrast to rules (a) to (c), Abelard notes (presumably with his opponent’s 
endorsement) that times behave as follows.  The day never exists all at once.  If the 
second part of the day is present, the first has necessarily already passed, and is no 
longer.  Thus, in contrast to rule (a), a day by definition can never be such that all its parts 
are simultaneously in existence.  Likewise, in contrast to (c), the day exists so long as one 
part of the day exists.  And, in contrast to (b), while it is necessary that some part of the 
day exist in order for the day to exist, it is not necessary that the first part of the day exist 
in order for the day to exist.  As Abelard observes in one of his discussions of these 
differences, times (and by implication speeches) behave like distributive wholes, for the 
existence of Human Being does not entail that Socrates exists, but if Socrates exists, 
Human Being necessarily exists (Log Ingr. 2, 187.15-20).  
Similar observations can be made for speech.  According to Abelard, when I say 
‘There is a dog’, by the time ‘dog’ has left my lips the other uttered sounds have gone out 
of existence.  Thus, the whole ‘There is a dog’ behaves like the day, and not like other 
integral wholes.  It is not necessary that—indeed, it is impossible that—all the parts of a 
speech are present simultaneously.  And while some part of the speech must be present in 
order that the speech is present, no particular part must exist for the speech to exist. 
After making these observations concerning the differences between other 
integral wholes and wholes whose parts exist in succession, Abelard rejects the claim that 
times and speeches are integral wholes.  In his Logica Ingredientibus Abelard complains 
that a day cannot be an integral whole because all its parts are not present at once (Log. 
Ingr. 2, 187.9-14): 

 
 
 
222
Since ‘day’ is the name of these twelve hours, it must be the case that all twelve 
hours are pointed out at once when they make up the day.  This is because a day is 
nothing other than these twelve hours.  But how can some things be many at once 
unless each one exists?  And how can they all persist at the same time when they 
do not make up one thing? 
 
The argument is far from convincing.  Days are by definition wholes whose parts exist in 
succession.  Necessarily, the parts of a day are not present all at once.  Abelard’s 
opponents readily acknowledge that wholes whose parts exist in succession do not 
behave like other integral wholes.  Abelard’s argument, hence, appears to be a case of 
begging the question, or at best a dispute over the meaning of ‘integral whole’.  Abelard 
has done nothing yet to show why times and speeches are not real. 
Abelard does somewhat better in his treatment of successive wholes in the 
Dialectica (Dial. 554.14-20): 
No composite is composed of only one part, nor is it the case that a part is such 
that the quantity of the whole fails to exceed it.  If there were only one part, it 
would follow that [the part] is the same as its whole.  But many parts at once 
never exist in a time, since many never exist at once.  It follows that a time never 
consists of many parts, as neither the first nor the middle nor the final [parts] 
remain, but it is always the case that only one part actually exists. 
 
Abelard reiterates the criticism that a time is always present because one part is present, 
whereas a whole should be present because all its parts are present.  But now Abelard 
attempts to back up this claim.  His opponent grants that at the first hour, the day exists, 
and that this is because the first part of the day is present.  Abelard finds something 
unintelligible in this admission.  The day is present.  But the middle of the day is not 
present, and the end of the day is not present.  The only part that is truly present is the 
first half of the day.  Thus, it appears that the quantity that is the first half of the day is 
presently identical to the quantity that is the day.  In short, the part is presently identical 

 
 
 
223
to its putative whole.  This will always be true.  Later on, the middle of the day will be 
identical to the day.  Still further on, the end of the day will be identical with the day.  At 
every point at which the whole exists it is identical to the part.  In other words, at any 
point in the whole’s existence, if I ask you to produce the whole, all you can do is 
produce a part of the whole. 
This is a better argument, but it still strikes me as a case of begging the question.  
At root, Abelard is assuming something very strong: that in order for something to exist, 
it must exist presently and altogether.  This assumption is precisely what the proponent of 
successive wholes rejects.  But rather than throw up our hands in dismay, perhaps I can 
show why Abelard thinks this is a plausible assumption to make.  The proponent of 
successive wholes is asking Abelard to admit a type of entity into his ontology which has 
properties very distinct from other objects already in his list of things that are real.  But 
just as Abelard has not yet given the proponent of successive wholes a reason to reject 
successive wholes, Abelard has not been given any reason to assume that there are such 
things as wholes that exist in virtue of succeeding parts.   
Consider three continuous moments in time t1, t2, and t3, and three stones a, b, 
and c.  At t1, a exists but b and c do not.  At t2, God annihilates a and replaces it with b.  
At t3, again God annihilates b and replaces it with c.  Now consider my claim that there 
exists a whole that is {a + b + c}.  When does this whole exist?  Does it exist at t1?  It 
seems that it does not.  Only a exists at t1.  Does it exist at t2?  No, only b exists at t2.  
And the same can be said of t3.  All three parts never existed together at any particular 
time.  What reason, then, do we have for thinking that the whole composed of a, b, and c 

 
 
 
224
ever existed?  Those who are sympathetic to the reality of successive wholes will respond 
that the whole {a + b + c} just is the succession of these three stones.  Moreover, given 
that it is a successive whole, it would be unreasonable to insist that there must be some 
point in time where {a + b + c} exists altogether.  This is indeed the proper response.  
But notice that the proponent of successive wholes has given Abelard no compelling 
reason to accept the existence of successive wholes such as {a + b + c}.  Lacking this 
compelling reason to admit them, and given that these successive entities behave 
differently from other integral wholes, Abelard opts to bar successive wholes from his 
catalog of the real. 
The thesis that no whole that exists in virtue of successive parts is real appears to 
be a first principle in his ontology.  But just as with the thesis of mereological constancy 
developed in the last section, precisely how this no-succession principle is formulated is 
important.  Since both times and speeches are quantities, it may at first appear that the 
principle states that no quantity exists whose parts exist in succession.  But, since 
quantities inhere in essentiae, I think that the principle is better formulated as the claim 
that there is no essentia whose parts exist in succession.  Anticipating developments in 
the next section I will suggest that this principle is consistent with Abelard’s claim that 
persons (and perhaps other substances) can persist through changes in parts. 
Abelard thinks that successive wholes are not real integral wholes, but this does 
not mean that talking about them amounts to nonsense.  Abelard draws a distinction 
between language about the way that things are, and figurative but convenient language 
(Dial. 554.20-23): 

 
 
 
225
Strictly speaking it cannot be said that a day ever exists, only figuratively, as if we 
were to say that the [whole day] exists through the part—i.e. its part exists.  But 
this [which does exist] is not strictly speaking even a part, since it does not 
compose [anything].  Only it exists. 
 
Abelard goes on to add that whole times are philosopher’s inventions (554.29-36).  A day 
is an abstraction developed out of a consideration of the instants of time that have come 
and passed away.  We can consider it as a whole and analyze it into its “parts”, but the 
composite does not exist in its own right.  Each moment in time has come and passed 
away, and in order for it to be a real whole, all its parts must be present at any moment 
that the whole purportedly exists.  In this manner, time is like speech, since even after the 
last syllable dissipates, our mind is able to hold the content of the physical speech in view 
and treat it as a meaningful whole.   
In his studies of Abelard on times, Henry correctly surmises that Abelard’s refusal 
to admit objects that exist through a succession of parts will prove to be an obstacle to his 
attempt to secure the persistence of objects through a change of parts (1990, 139 ff., and 
1984, 248 ff.).  For this reason, Henry thinks that Abelard has made a mistake, failing 
both to see the ramifications of his pronouncements upon the status of times, and to make 
use of the distinction between X-parts and parts-of-X.   
But as the last section should have made clear, I think that Abelard fully intends 
to make the extremist claims from which Henry wants to rescue him.  With respect to the 
claim that Abelard should have availed himself of the distinction between parts-of-X and 
X-parts, first I am not convinced that Abelard ever assents to this distinction.  Many of 
the passages that Henry cites as proof that Abelard notices the distinction fail to bolster 
Henry’s claim.  Instead of lamenting Abelard’s sloppiness for failing to resort to the 

 
 
 
226
distinction when discussing problems pertaining to persistence, I take the absence of 
Henry’s distinction in these discussions to be more evidence that Abelard never 
acknowledged the distinction in the first place.  Second, as I have already made clear in 
chapter 2 (2.4.3), I am far from convinced that the distinction between X-parts and parts-
of-X fulfills its promise as a solution out of difficult quandaries concerning ontological 
dependence and persistence.  In the case of times in particular, Henry thinks that Abelard 
rejects the existence of times as wholes among other reasons because a time violates rule 
(c) from above.  It is true, he notes that if an X-part exists, then it is not necessary that X 
exist.  But if a part-of-X exists, then necessarily that of which it is part, X, must exist 
(1984, 253).  If only Abelard had remembered this difference, Henry muses.  Then, he 
would have seen that times are perfectly acceptable integral wholes.  But if I am right, 
Abelard’s reluctance to call times wholes has to do precisely with the successiveness of 
these wholes.  Abelard does not see a compelling reason why a string of succeeding 
objects counts as one whole.  Henry’s principle about parts-of-X is uncontroversial only 
for those cases where the parts are all present—cases like a house.  It is not obvious that 
the rule should hold for successive entities. 
In my study of Abelard’s problem of increase I suggested that brooms and houses 
are not things that persist through mereological changes, they are actually a series of 
things of the same sort.  Here is precisely where I think Abelard’s claims about the status 
of times do ramify, as he himself seems to be aware.  Right after announcing that talking 
about days is figurative, Abelard makes this startling pronouncement (Log. Ingr. 2, 
187.40-188.1): 

 
 
 
227
Accordingly, in truth one can never truly and properly say that a day exists, or 
that a whole exists, or that this quantity exists, or even that bronze or anything 
altogether exists. 
 
It is unclear what the scope of the last “anything altogether” is.  I will argue that it at least 
falls short of including persons.  But the passage is provocative, for it suggests that just as 
whole times are figurative abstractions brooms, houses, and other artifacts are likewise 
convenient fictions.   
 
4.3.3: Substantial persistence 
I have argued that the Principle of Mereological Constancy is not merely a 
principle about the quantity of things, it is about things—namely the mereological sums 
that are the matter of objects.  Stones, plants and animals are composites of matter and 
substantial differentiae, whereas artifacts are composites of matter arranged to produce 
supervening, accidental features.  Artifacts and substances are similar materially.  The 
difference between the two types of object must come from the presence of substantial 
differentiae.  In contrast to the forms of artifacts, substantial differentiae, or at least some 
of them, are themselves essentiae.  It is the reality of the differentiae that will allow 
substances to persist in ways that artifacts can not.  
Several caveats are necessary.  First, the claim that the differentiae are real is only 
as strong as the evidence.  The texts in Abelard, we already remarked, are ambiguous; the 
key supporting text is a secondhand report (4.1.2).  If the substantial differentiae are not 
real, then stones, plants and animals will become strings of entities of the same sort. 
Second, Abelard does not explicitly puzzle over the persistence of non-human substances 

 
 
 
228
to the same degree as he worries about artifacts and humans.  Much of this section is 
based upon circumstantial evidence—in particular, upon Abelard’s insistence in the strict 
divide between artifacts and substances, and upon several remarks that Abelard makes 
about human beings in so far as they are substances.  What follows is an admittedly 
speculative reconstruction of what Abelard could say, if pressed on the persistence of 
substances. 
Once substances are considered, the question whether a thing persists is 
ambiguous between two more refined questions: Does this substance persist?  And, does 
this essentia persist?  To answer these more refined questions, let us draw a distinction 
between being essentially the same over time and being substantially the same over time.  
This distinction is slightly artificial in that it regiments a distinction between essentia and 
substantia that Abelard is not always careful to maintain.  But there are places where 
Abelard suggests this distinction, and the regimentation on our part will make matters 
more manageable.  The relation being essentially the same over time is closely related to 
being the same in essentia, as it is characterized in section 4.2.1, and is another way of 
describing mereological constancy.  Roughly speaking if the essentia of x has all the 
same parts and no more or less parts as the essentia of y, and ‘x’ names some object at t1 
and ‘y’ names an object at t2, then x is essentially the same as y over the span of time t1 
to t2.  A simple example might make matters clearer: if ‘x’ names {a + b + c} at t1, and 
‘y’ names {a + b + c} at t2, then x and y are essentially the same over the span of time t1 
to t2.  Now suppose that {a + b + c} is the matter of a stone.  Furthermore, suppose I chip 
away a, but the substantial differentiae that made it a stone are intact.  The stone fails to 

 
 
 
229
be essentially the same over the time in which the change occurred, yet we are inclined to 
say that the stone is the same substance.  Both {a + b + c} and {b + c} possess the state 
being a stone. 
The description of this simple material change is incomplete, since having the 
same state does not get us to the claim that this stone persists after losing a.  Many 
individuals can possess the same status, and hence be substantially the same.  Abelard 
notes that the substantial differentia is the last item to enter into the constitution of an 
individual’s substance (Dial. 546.28-547.26).  There is no further differentia that yields 
the individual substance.  Since the genus plus differentiae constitute the definition of a 
substance, the individual does not have its own definition (584.26-29).  Nevertheless, 
while two individuals may be substantially the same, they will differ from one another 
with respect to their “proper substance” (Theol. Chr. III §72; p. 224.931-939): 
But, while Socrates is different numerically from Plato—i.e. one is different from 
the other because their being is distinct (ex discretione propriae essentiae)—it is 
not the case that [Socrates] is said to be altogether other than [Plato]—i.e. that 
[Socrates] differs substantially [from Plato].  They both belong to this nature on 
account of the fact that they agree in the same species.  That is, they [agree] in 
that they are each a man.  Thus, they are not distinct because of any substantial 
difference, so that he is not other than the other because [his] substance belongs to 
a different species.  Rather, Socrates is other (as it has been said) in person—i.e. 
because of a distinctness of proper substance (ex discretione scilicet propriae 
substantiae).  
 
Let us set aside the introduction of personhood until the next section, and instead focus 
upon the idea of being a proper substance.203  This concept lends its name to what we are 
after in the case of the stone.  We want to know the conditions under which this stone is 
                                                 
203 There is, nonetheless, a close relationship between the notion of being a proper substance and being the 
same person.  See my remarks in section 4.3.4.  

 
 
 
230
the same proper substance over time.  Abelard does not give us an explicit criterion for 
being the same proper substance over time.  But, I argue, the criterion is similar to the 
sortal criteria which we uncovered in Abelard’s analysis of the growing argument.   
Return to the stone with matter {a + b + c}.  Removing any of the substantial 
differentia that in combination with {a + b + c} makes this stone a stone will entail 
substantial change—destruction.  The matter, {a + b + c}, “relinquishes a species state” 
(speciale status) or “substantial being” (substantiale esse) (Log. Ingr. 2, 297.4-5, and 
Dial. 418.8).204  On the other hand, if I chip away a, yet {b + c} retains its substantial 
differentiae, {b + c} retains the state of being stone.  The parts a, b and c are all 
primitively particular, because as Abelard claims elsewhere the particularity of things is a 
brute fact (Log. Ingr. 1, 64.20-24).205  Moreover, {b + c} shares parts with {a + b + c}.  
Since this relation is measured over time, it would be imprecise to say that they overlap.  
We could however coin a phrase and claim that {a + b + c} and {b + c} trans-temporally 
overlap.  Thus, in the imagined scenario where I chip away a, the stone is not essentially 
the same over time, yet the stone remains the same proper substance over time.   
Essential sameness over time is dependent upon the mereological constancy of the 
being of things.  Substantial sameness is dependent upon the retention of a species state.  
                                                 
204 The reader might wonder why I insist on using Abelard’s idiosyncratic terminology, and not the more 
familiar terminology of a kind.  The reason is that Abelard only recognizes natural kinds as items that have 
genera and species.  In Abelard’s view a status is more general than a kind, since for example artifacts can 
also possess status. 
205 Abelard rejects the popular medieval theory of individuation by accidental forms.  What makes Socrates 
this very individual human cannot be his accidental forms, since it would then be the case that accidents are 
naturally prior to substances, which as any good Aristotelian knows is false (Log. Ingr. 1, 64.7-14).  
Individuation by accidents is a component of what Gracia identifies as the Standard Theory of Individuality 
(1984, 124-128).  Another popular medieval principle of individuation is matter, but no twelfth-century 
philosopher entertains this option. 

 
 
 
231
If we grant that substantial differentiae are real (essentiae)—as we did in section 4.1.2—
then substantial sameness is dependent upon the constancy of the differentia through 
change.  Since the differentia, unlike a supervening form, is real, it is robust enough to be 
the one of the principles of persistence. 
Still, is the differentia the only principle of persistence?  I have mentioned that the 
reality of substantial differentiae would let Abelard hold a stronger form-matter theory of 
constitution.  But to hold the strongest version of the form-matter theory, Abelard would 
have to be committed to the view that the differentiae are sufficient for persistence.  
Whether Abelard holds the strongest version depends upon how we interpret Abelard’s 
suggestion that differentiae could have informed other substances than they actually do 
(Log. Ingr. 1, 84.19-21):206 
This Socrates could have been [a man] through a different [rationality]—whether 
this [other rationality] exists or never exists—as he is a man through this 
[particular rationality]. 
 
It is unclear whether Abelard thinks that differentiae are actually separable once they 
inform some essentia, or whether he holds the weaker claim that, at the moment when 
God was informing essentia, he could have used this rationality as opposed to that one.  
On the weaker interpretation, this rationality trope, Rat1, could have been combined with, 
Ess2, rather than Ess1; yet once God makes Rat1 + Ess1, it is not possible for Rat1 to 
come loose and drift over to another essentia.  Abelard’s interpretation of Aristotle’s 
claim about the inseparability of accidents suggests, but only suggests the weaker modal 
claim concerning differentiae (Log. Ingr. 2, 129.31-131.9; cf. Marenbon 1997, 121-22). 
                                                 
206 Cf. Log. Ingr. 1, 92.22-9; and Marenbon (1997, 120). 

 
 
 
232
On the other hand, independent, philosophical considerations suggest that Abelard 
should hold the stronger view, and hence assert that the persistence of differentiae is the 
only necessary and sufficient condition for substantial persistence.  Consider two plants: 
A is composed out of differentia P1 and the sum {a + b + c}; B is composed out of P2 
and {d + e + f}.  Through normal metabolic processes, a is lost by A and taken in by B.  
Meanwhile, d is lost by B and taken in by A.  According to the criteria set out for being 
the same proper substance, P1 + {d + b + c} is the same proper substance (over time) as 
P1 + {a + b + c}, and P2 + {a + e + f} is the same proper substance as P2 + {d + e + f}.  
In other words, A and B persist through their respective changes in matter.  Fast-forward 
to a time where through the same metabolic changes, we have P1 + {d + e + f} and P2 + 
{a + b + c}.  It seems that we must say that A is the former form-matter composite and 
that A is the same proper substance as P1 + {d + e + f} over the time in which the 
metabolic changes took place.  Likewise, B is now P2 + {a + b + c}.  Now consider a 
case where God performs a wholesale switch of A’s and B’s matter.  The result is again, 
a case where we have the two objects with metaphysical structures P1 + {d + e + f} and 
P2 + {a + b + c}.  And again, I see no reason why A is not the same proper substance as 
the sum informed by P1, and that B is the sum informed by P2.  It does not make any 
difference whether the material switch is gradual or wholesale.  At the end of the change 
A is the same proper substance over the span of time measured by the change as P1 + {d 
+ e + f} and B is P2 + {a + b + c}.  The second change does not occur in nature, but 
surely it is in God’s power to do it.   

 
 
 
233
By now the reader should be able to see that mereological continuity of the matter 
is neither sufficient nor necessary for substantial persistence.  The substance need only 
possess the right sort of matter to be the same proper substance.  From a purely 
philosophical perspective, Abelard should hold the strong form-matter theory of 
constitution for substances. 
Is it safe to say that substantial change is a type of essential change, but not all 
essential change is substantial change?  This would only be true if the reality of 
differentiae entailed that they count as parts of a substance’s being.  The presence of the 
term ‘essentia’ in both cases suggests that real differentiae should be parts.  But Abelard, 
in fact, may not think that any form—supervening or real—is a part, at least in the sense 
of ‘part’ used when measuring sameness in being and essential sameness over time.  For 
example, in the Theologia Summi Boni he claims that the body is prior to this man even 
though the body and the man are numerically the same (TSB III, i, §12; p. 163, 208 ff.).  
The body and the man can only be numerically the same if they share all the same parts.  
But the body by itself does not possess the differentia rationality.  This body could have 
possessed another differentia, in particular irrationality.  In the Dialectica, Abelard 
insists that forms do not make up the essentia of a thing (non in essentia componit), yet 
they nevertheless “bring the substance of the thing to completion” when they “advene” 
upon the thing’s matter (Dial. 415.35-416.6).  The example Abelard gives is the 
inherence of rationality in an animal.  There is, thus, evidence that differentiae are not 
parts, even though they are real. 

 
 
 
234
The main features of the persistence conditions for substances still stand.  In 
contrast to his hylomorphic theory of artifacts, Abelard should hold a strong form-matter 
theory of constitution for substances.  The substantial differentiae are real, and their 
reality underwrites the persistence of a substance.  In the natural course of things, the 
persistence of this proper substance is measured by the persistence of this differentia 
trope and an essentia that is mereologically continuous with previous essentiae inhabited 
by this trope.  
 
4.3.4: The persistence of persons207 
Unlike the case of non-human substances, Abelard explicitly rejects the view that 
human beings must be mereologically constant (TSB III, i, §14; p. 164.227-229): 
There is nothing in the divine substance at some time that was not present at some 
other time; whereas in the same man there are parts at some time which are not 
present in him at some other time.  And [the same man] frequently gains and loses 
accidents. 
 
This is also apparent from Abelard’s rejection of the view that every part of a man is a 
“principal part”—that is, the removal of any part entails the destruction of not only the 
quantity, but also the substance of a thing (Dial. 552.6-14 my emphasis):208 
                                                 
207 ‘Person’ is an ambiguous notion.  According to Boethius a person is properly defined as an individual 
substance capable of reason (Contra Eut III, p. 214.171-2).  With the added restriction to human beings, 
this is the notion of person that we will pursue in this section.  But there is also a looser sense of person, 
which Abelard uses to when he claims that all things are “personally discrete”.  This latter, looser sense of 
‘person’ is related to being a proper substance, and it applies to all individuals.  Twelfth-century 
philosophers also extend the notion of person to the Father, Son and Holy Spirit.  For our purposes, we can 
steer away from the persons of the Trinity, and the complications that Trinitarian theology introduces. 
208 For a careful analysis of this portion of the Dialectica, consult Henry (1991, 92-115) and see also the 
helpful summary in King (2004, 79-81). 

 
 
 
235
Therefore, it stands according to our newest argument209 that whenever any part is 
destroyed the whole is necessarily destroyed.  It follows, then, that every part is a 
principal part, if we understand ‘in substance’ according to the destructivist’s 
sense [of the phrase] (vim destructionis).  If Socrates’ fingernail is removed some 
quantity persists in the remaining body, but that whole [quantity], which was in 
the whole previously, [does not now persist].  Likewise, a substance persists, but 
not that whole [substance] which existed previously (i.e. that of which the 
fingernail as a part had existed and had been removed).210  Therefore, it is not the 
case that the quantity is destroyed rather than the substance, of which substance 
the fingernail was a part. 
 
The Abelard’s opponent, not Abelard, is committed to the claim that if a fingernail is 
clipped, the substance that has that fingernail as a part perishes.  Abelard tries to distance 
himself from this consequence (Dial. 552.15-27): 
Given that the destruction of the substance of a whole follows from the 
destruction of any of its parts, what will we say when we see that Socrates 
remains even though his fingernail or the whole hand or foot is lost and that in 
this case the substance of a man persists intact?  It therefore does not seem that 
this man consists of all his parts at once, but only of those after which he cannot 
be found.  Otherwise his predication appears equivocal over different times in 
accord with the increase or decrease of his body.211  If ‘Socrates’ and ‘this man’ 
become names of all of those which are now in the man at the same time, given 
that this man is said to be this body, all those present in [him] will be predicated.  
But, then, if a fingernail is severed or a foot is removed and ‘this man’ is said of 
the remaining body, the predication will not be the same with respect to the 
substance that is now diminished.  And the substance of this man, which was 
previously, cannot be said to be that [substance], which now exists.  That is, the 
hand along with the rest of the body [cannot be said] to be the rest of the body. 
 
Once this is conceded, it follows that the removal of any part of a human being entails the 
substantial destruction of that human being.  And since the substantial destruction of a 
                                                 
209 See Dial. 551.6-17.  
210 The text is difficult: sic quoque substantia remanet, sed non ea tota quae prius exstiterat cuius videlict 
pars unguis ademptus exstiterat. 
211 Cf. LNPS 548.4-10, quoted below. 

 
 
 
236
human being is murder, his opponent is committed to the claim that the clipping of a 
fingernail is an act of murder (Dial. 552.32-34): 
Therefore, it is necessary that when a hand is removed, the man who was there 
before does not now remain.  It follows that if one were to remove either a hand 
or any other part of a man, one appears to commit murder. 
 
Abelard admits that his previous claim was hyperbolic.  After making the rhetorical jab, 
Abelard is content to retract the accusation of murder (Dial. 552.34-37): 
But, perhaps not every destruction of a man is called murder; only those cases 
where one expels the soul from its seat [count as murder].  Murder is the act of 
slaying a man, and an act of slaying cannot occur unless by means of the 
expulsion of a soul. 
 
The primary point, however, stands.  Abelard wants to distance himself from the claim 
that the Principle of Mereological Constancy applies to human beings. 
Abelard’s resistance to the position endorsed by his current opponent is odd, since 
Abelard clearly holds the Principle of Mereological Constancy, and he interprets it 
strongly enough that it begins to collapse the distinction between substantial change and 
quantitative change.212  The oddity is only enhanced because in his struggle with the 
destructivists, Abelard does not carefully distinguish between his example of the house, 
and his example of Socrates.  The change from the house to Socrates is abrupt, and it is 
not flagged as an important switch.  I think this is an oversight on Abelard’s part.  But we 
can help him out and flag the switch on his behalf.  When we clarify Abelard’s poition, I 
think it is clear that, with respect to artifacts, Abelard is a mereological essentialist.  With 
                                                 
212 D. P. Henry also notices this oddity.  He thinks that it is because Abelard fails to employ the distinction 
that Abelard himself “discovered” at other points in his writings (1985, 84-87).  I think that Abelard fails to 
use the distinction between X-parts and parts-of-X because he never developed this distinction (see 2.4.3 
above). 

 
 
 
237
respect to human beings, it is just as clear that he wants to resist mereological 
essentialism.  Abelard’s final attack against his current opponent mentions only human 
beings.  It is the consequences for human beings that ultimately give Abelard pause. 
I conjectured that non-human substances persist because of the presence of 
substantial differentiae.  This conjecture depends upon the premise that substantial 
differentiae are real, if not parts of substances.  In the case of human beings, no 
conjecturing is necessary.  The personal identity and personal persistence of human 
beings is grounded upon the persistence of the human soul. 
Like the distinction between substance and essentia, one can also distinguish 
between an essentia and a person.  This clue comes from the writings of Abelard’s 
followers, the Nominales.213  The Nominales were infamous for holding the view that 
“nothing grows” (nihil crescit),214 or as one earlier document preserves it, “no thing 
grows” (nulla res crescit).215  This opinion matches the view espoused in Abelard’s 
discussion of increase (4.3.1).  But the view of the Nominales has an interesting wrinkle.  
According to our sources the Nominales claim that a substantia or essentia cannot grow, 
but a person can grow (Iwakuma and Ebbesen 1992, 185 text 33a): 
They say that the substance which is Socrates (que est Socrates) ceases to be, but 
Socrates does not cease to be.  For they distinguish between the essentia and the 
person. 
 
                                                 
213 Some of the opinions are preserved in the texts collected by Iwakuma and Ebbesen (1992). On the 
relation between Abelard and the Nominales, consult especially the studies by Calvin Normore (1992) and 
Sten Ebbesen (1992 and 1991). 
214 Iwakuma and Ebbesen (1992, 202 text 53; cf. 191 text 37). 
215 Iwakuma and Ebbesen (1992, 184 text 26). 

 
 
 
238
Unlike Abelard, the Nominales do not seem to distinguish between the essentia of 
Socrates and the substance of Socrates, and both the essentia and the substance are 
subject to the Principle of Mereological Constancy.216  In another Nominalist text, the 
anonymous author claims that, “Every subtraction or addition of a part and every 
transposition of parts changes the being of the whole”. (Ebbesen 1991, 438; reproduced 
in Ebbesen 1992, 70).  The author makes no effort to distinguish between forms that 
weakly supervene and forms that are real.  It seems that every form weakly supervenes.  
The author then addresses a challenge to this position.  The challenger asks how can this 
proposition ‘the ill can be well’ (sanum potest esse aegrum) be true?  For what is ill 
cannot cease to be so without the loss, acquisition or transposition of some part—namely, 
it seems, some accidental form.217  But if it ceases to be ill, it ceases to be.  Consequently, 
that which is ill cannot become well.  The anonymous Nominalist replies (ibid.): 
Whatever is healthy is naturally healthy, and whatever is ill is naturally ill.  
Nonetheless, the same man who is healthy can be ill (tamen idem homo qui est 
sanus potest esse aeger). 
 
There is, hence, a difference between a person, and the being that is this person.  Put 
another way, “that which is Socrates”—viz. the essentia—cannot change parts, but 
Socrates can endure changes in parts.218 
                                                 
216 For example, see text 40b (Iwakuma and Ebbesen 1992, 192), and text 48d (idem. 198). 
217 Of course, for Abelard, the form of illness or of healthiness is not a part of the man.  Nevertheless, since 
a change of form does not occur unless there is a change in the disposition of the material parts, the realist 
challenge goes through. 
218 “Again, we say that nothing which now is [Socrates] will be Socrates if any part is added or subtracted 
from it (nihil erit Socrates quod modo sit si aliqua pars ei addatur vel subtrahatur)”.  The text is 
reproduced by Ebbesen (1992, 70 footnote 12). 

 
 
 
239
It is clear from these fragments that the essentia of Socrates is identified with his 
material parts, and hence Socrates’ essentia changes when parts are added or lost.  The 
Nominalist’s usage of ‘essentia’ is consistent with Abelard’s usage (LNPS 548.4-10):219 
Note that ‘Socrates’ signifies this substance, since [it signifies] this man.  But it 
does not signify that substance which is constantly varying due to the influx and 
efflux [sc. of matter].  If it signified this substance, which is now Socrates, as well 
as a future being (cras essentiam) that will in the future be Socrates, then 
[‘Socrates’] would constantly change its signification, since Socrates is not the 
same being today and tomorrow.  But [a changing signification] is unacceptable. 
  
But in contrast to the Nominales, Abelard also suggests that we must make a distinction 
between substance and being, since ‘substance’ is used to pick out both that which has 
the state of being this man, and that which is the matter of Socrates—i.e. the “substance 
which is constantly varying”.  The ambiguous use of ‘substance’ is also detectable in this 
passage (Dial. 421.17-23): 
A thing is changed with respect to increase when the quantity of a substance has 
grown through the addition of something—e.g. when God by means of [His] 
unseen [power] applies increases to [us as] young boys and extends our substance 
with respect to some dimension, whether it be in height, in length or in width.  
Diminishment [occurs] when something belonging to a substance is lost or 
subtracted—e.g. when God shrinks our substance little by little as we become 
older. 
 
Here ‘substance’ might refer to a continuous series of essentiae that possess the state 
being a man.  Or it might refer to Socrates’ matter.  I will hold off from speculating about 
the significance of the differences between Abelard and the Nominales until chapter 6, 
with the exception of this observation:  Perhaps the Nominales noticed Abelard’s sloppy 
use of the term ‘substance’ and they attempted to apply it more stringently.  For now I 
                                                 
219 This point of comparison between Abelard and the Nominales is hightlighted by Normore (1992, 89-
90). 

 
 
 
240
will attempt to locate a difference between essentia and substance, as well as a difference 
between substance and person.  Due to ambiguous use of ‘substance’ by Abelard, I will 
again impose an artificial regularity where none is present.   
We start with the distinction between essentia, substance and proper substance.  
An essentia must be mereologically constant.  It is especially important to distinguish 
between being the same substance, and being the same proper substance over time, 
because being the same substance requires only that the same state is possessed.  Plato 
and Socrates agree in the state of being a man, and hence are the same in substance.  Yet 
Plato and Socrates are not the same proper substance (see 4.3.3).  Synchronically, 
Socrates’ proper substance is this essentia combined with this set of differentiae.  As I 
argued in 4.1.2 the soul is not the differentia rationality.  Nonetheless, Socrates’ soul and 
his rationality are closely related. Were the soul to depart the body, the body would also 
lose its rationality.220 
The presence of Socrates’ soul guarantees that this man remains the same proper 
substance through change.  Consider this possible act of God: one night He switches 
Socrates’ soul with Plato’s soul.  Abelard does not explicitly raise this body-swapping 
puzzle, but I think he must claim that {Socrates’ soul + Plato’s body} is still Socrates.  
Plato’s body considered at an instant is a particular sum of material parts (perhaps 
informed with some corporeal differentiae).  Over time, Plato’s body is mereologically 
                                                 
220 There is a potential wrinkle: since Abelard claims that differentiae do not individuate substances (Dial. 
421.1-8), and that God could have combined this rationality with another substance, it appears that our 
criteria for being the same proper substance over time and being the same person over time will come apart 
in a different respect.  Were God to replace Socrates’ rationality with Plato’s rationality, Socrates’ soul 
would still be Socrates’ soul, but the composite of soul plus body would no longer be the same proper 
substance. 

 
 
 
241
inconstant, as it continually gains and loses parts.  ‘Plato’s body’ picks out more than one 
essentiae.  It is possible that the sum of parts that once was Plato’s body now happens to 
constitute Socrates’ body, and when that sum is unified with Socrates’ soul, it is Socrates’ 
body.  When we have the composite {Socrates’ soul + Plato’s body}, in truth we have the 
composite {Socrates’ soul + Socrates’ body (that was, by the way, once the matter of 
Plato)}.   
Socrates’ soul also explains why Socrates is the same person over time.221  But 
personhood adds a further complication to the picture.  A man is either identified with the 
soul plus the body, or with the body.  A person is ultimately identified with the soul.  
Socrates the person is hence distinct from Socrates the man.  If the soul is removed from 
its body, Socrates the man no longer persists.  This is an act of homicide.  But so long as 
Socrates’ soul is not annihilated, Socrates the person survives.   
                                                 
221 Socrates’ soul also explains why there is no more than one Socrates present in this very man at any 
particular time.  As Abelard notes at several points in his writings, there are many proper parts of this very 
individual man than can also lay claim to being a man (TSB III.i, §21; p. 166.289-301): “In one man there 
are many parts, which are distinct from one another (such that this is not that)… which when some parts are 
removed or cut off are called ‘men’…  Each of these parts before removal was a man… Our separation 
does not confer in substance to that which remains or was removed something that was not there 
previously.  This is because when a hand is cut off, that which now remains a man, remained a man before 
the cut [as] some part lying with the man, who was whole.  Likewise, if a foot is cut off, the rest is a man, 
which was a man before the cut, since it also had the definition of a man…”  Nevertheless, because these 
man-candidates overlap this very individual man, they are not numerically distinct from this very man.  
These arbitrarily many man-candidates share one very special part, viz. Socrates’ soul (TSB III.i, §21; p. 
167.303-306):  “Nevertheless we don’t say that there are many men in one man, since we don’t say that 
there are many men unless there are [many] being nourished by many souls.”  We could readily add on 
Abelard’s behalf that there are not many Socrateses because there is only one soul inhabiting these 
overlapping wholes, and this soul is Socrates’ soul.  This last claim appears as an assumption in his 
argument of the many Socrateses in Socrates (Theol. Chr. III, § 153; p. 252.1868-73).   

 
 
 
242
4.4: Conclusion to chapter 4 
Abelard’s discussions of mereology and his application of mereological principles 
to his theories of identity, material constitution and persistence are exciting and bold.  
Abelard’s appreciation of the phenomenon of mereological overlap helps him to develop 
a unique and exciting theory of sameness and difference.  The additional mode of 
sameness and difference in property gives him the resources to resolve the problem of 
material constitution.  Abelard’s remarks about mereological change and diachronic 
identity are equally exciting, even if at times, they are not as fleshed out as we would like 
them to be.  In particular, we wish that he had explicitly entertained some particular 
puzzles (for example, the soul swap thought experiment), or been more definitive 
regarding his views oo the status of the differentia, or the relation between rationality and 
the soul.  But these complaints should not overshadow the sophistication of his 
mereological insights, and the rigor of his argumentation.  Abelard’s mereology is the 
culmination of a tradition, and I insist, one of the high points in the history of mereology.  
His only equal in the twelfth century is the subject of our next chapter, Pseudo-Joscelin.

 
 
 
243
CHAPTER 5 
 
 
PSEUDO-JOSCELIN AND THE MODERATE CRITIQUE OF ABELARD 
 
 
 
 
Abelard’s mereology is a remarkable advance in the history of the subject, but we 
have already seen some of its limitations in the previous chapter.  In particular, Abelard 
has trouble with the problem of persistence.  A form of mereological essentialism is true 
in the case of artifacts (4.3.1).  Abelard is equally explicit about his commitment to the 
persistence of human beings—their principle of persistence ultimately being the soul 
(4.3.4).  The trouble lies with those items that fall in between artifacts and persons.  On 
the one hand, Abelard draws a strict divide between substances and artifacts.  On the 
other hand, Abelard thinks that many forms weakly supervene upon the arrangement of 
the material parts.  I attempted to interpolate a theory of persistence for primary 
substances that would account for both of these explicit principles; yet the resulting 
theory relied upon the controversial claim that the substantial forms—the differentiae—of 
primary substances are real, and not weakly supervening items (4.3.3).  The problem is 
that while Strong hylomorphism is what Abelard should assent to in order to retain his 
distinction between substances and artifacts, Abelard does not clearly and explicitly 
endorse such a theory.  To make matters worse for Abelard, while his commitment to the 

 
 
 
244
mereological essentialism of artifacts is coherent and defensible, it does not accord with 
our common intuitions about the nature of artifacts.  When the broom in my kitchen loses 
a few hairs, I still take it to be the same broom, and not just “the same” in some 
philosophically loose sense.  
Hence, there is room for a more accommodating picture of persistence: one which 
explicitly accounts for primary substances besides human beings, and which accords with 
our unreflective experience of household objects.  We do not need to wait long to find 
such accounts.  Our current evidence suggests that the problem of persistence was a 
common topic of discussion in the schools of the early to middle twelfth century.  A 
variety of answers were offered to the problem, some in apparent response to Abelard.   
One author in particular stands out for his mereological insights and theory of 
persistence.  He is the mysterious author of the treatise De generibus et speciebus (“On 
Genera and Species”).222  This text is preserved in two manuscripts.  It is attributed to 
Abelard by Victor Cousin and included in his 1836 edition of Abelard’s work.  The 
attribution was first disputed by Prantl (1885, 144).  The reader need only explore the 
contents of this chapter to see for herself how wrong Cousin is.   
While it is clear that the author is not Abelard, the identity of the author remains 
unknown.  The De generibus et speciebus contains a defense of the collection theory of 
universals.  From John of Salisbury we know that Joscelin, the bishop of Soissons, as 
                                                 
222 For my account of the text and authorship I rely upon the research of Peter King, whose edition of the 
De generibus is forthcoming.  All citations of the De generibus are to this edition.  An older version of the 
edition is included as an appendix to King’s dissertation (1982, vol 2, 143-85); an even older edition is 
printed in Cousin (1836, 507-550). 

 
 
 
245
well as “another” thinker (alius) defended the collection theory.223  At De generibus § 14, 
the manuscript refers to a “Master G”, whom Cousin took to refer to Guillaume de 
Champeaux but whom, Peter King argues, is more likely Master Goslenus (i.e. Joscelin).  
Based on these two pieces of evidence, King infers that the author of the De generibus is 
a student or colleague of Joscelin, and to indicate this he dubs the author Pseudo-Joscelin. 
Based on further internal evidence, King hypothesizes that the author wrote the treatise 
circa 1120-1130.  On authorship and dating, we defer to Professor King’s judgment.  
Because I think no confusion will arise, in the remainder of the chapter I will refer to the 
author of De generibus as merely Joscelin. 
In my view Joscelin provides a forceful response to Abelard’s more essentialist 
and eliminativist leanings.  I will attempt to demonstrate this in two parts.  First, I will 
examine Joscelin’s critique of mereological essentialism and his alternative proposal of 
identity and persistence (5.1).  I will then consider Joscelin’s response to Abelard’s 
criticisms of the collection theory of universals.  I will show how Joscelin’s general 
theory of identity and persistence with respect to mereological constitution and 
mereological change is adapted to develop a more defensible version of the collection 
theory (5.2).   
 
5.1: The Moderate theory of identity and persistence 
In order to make Joscelin’s views intelligible and thus present them in their best 
possible light, I will need to develop the framework within which Joscelin develops his 
                                                 
223 Metalogicon II.17 (ed. J. B. Hall, p. 83). 

 
 
 
246
remarkable theory.  Joscelin’s remarks about the identity and persistence of wholes are 
best understood once we have an understanding of the twelfth-century puzzle that 
Joscelin is specifically addressing, which I will call the Mereological Sorites. 
In the first section (5.1.1), I present a general version of the Mereological Sorites.  
Then I sketch in broad terms the positions that twelfth-century thinkers generally take 
with respect to the Sorites.  I call the most intuitive position towards the Sorites the 
Moderate position.  In the second section (5.1.2), I outline the best strategy that the 
Moderate can employ for defusing the Sorites.  In my view, Joscelin develops a sound 
response to the Sorites by following the guidelines offered by the Moderate.  In order to 
demonstrate that the Moderate position was a popular response to the Sorites, and that 
Joscelin’s theory is forceful version of the position I will sometimes compare Joscelin’s 
remarks with other Moderate writings.  In particular, I will make use of the treatment of 
the Sorites found in an anonymous treatise dubbed the Introductiones Montanae 
maiores.224 
 
5.1.1: The Mereological Sorites 
The history of twelfth-century philosophy is incomplete, but recent strides in 
textual and historical scholarship have revealed a rich scholastic tradition in this 
                                                 
224 The text of the Introductiones is preserved in MS Paris, Bibliothèque Nationale cod. lat.15141.  Aside 
from excerpts printed in De Rijk’s studies, there is no printed—let alone critical—edition at present.

period.225  Mereological topics are a significant part of the curriculum in these schools, 
possibly because it is recognized that mereology plays a crucial role in a variety of 
philosophical and theological debates.226  Among the mereological topics covered in the 
curriculum are puzzles pertaining to persistence.  Sometimes the problem of persistence 
is raised in the guise of the Growing Argument; but often the problem of persistence is 
raised in the form of what I will call the Mereological Sorites. 
The Mereological Sorites is a particularly colorful and forceful way to motivate 
an extreme form of what we identified in chapter 2 as mereological essentialism (2.4.1).  
The Sorites is troubling to early medieval thinkers because it appeals to a rule canonized 
in the Boethian tradition, which is often introduced as the “topic (locus)227 from the 
whole”: 
(R) Si totum est, pars est. 
 
The contrapositive of (R)—si pars non est, totum non est—appears to express the same 
thing as the topic from the integral part: destructa parte destruitur totum.  The Latin, 
since it does not mark indefinite and definite nouns, makes translation of the rule 
difficult.  (R) could be translated as: “If the whole exists, the part exists.”  Or: “If the 
                                                 
225 In the past few years our knowledge of the history of eleventh and twelfth century philosophy has been 
augmented by the palaeographical spadework of John Marenbon, Yukio Iwakuma, and Sten Ebessen.  See 
the list of references for citations. 
226 For example, Chris Martin (1998) hypothesizes that resolutions of the Growing Argument (see 4.3.1) 
had direct application to theories of the Incarnation.   
227 Following Cicero, Boethius defines an argumentum as the sense of the words used in proving some 
proposition.  The “topic” is defined as “the source of the argumentum” (De top. Diff. 3.13-14).  For a brief 
discussion of Boethius on the topics, see Martin (2004, 160 ff.).  Abelard thinks that the “topics” serve as 
the vis inferentiae, or as Martin glosses it, “the warrant for an entailment” (idem. 169). 

 
 
 
248
whole exists, a part exists.”  Or: “If a whole exists, a part exists.”228  Given that the rule is 
used to motivate a form of mereological essentialism, the author of the Sorites thinks that 
something like the following is an appropriate translation: 
(R*) “If this whole exists, then [any] part [belonging to that whole] exists.” 
However, as I will show below, many philosophers propose a weaker reading of (R).  
Expressing the rule in this way highlights its relation to Boethius’ thesis that the part is 
naturally prior to the integral whole (3.2.2).  According to Boethius’ thesis, the parts can 
exist while the whole does not, but the whole cannot exist without the parts.  Interpreted 
weakly, Boethius’ thesis of natural priority states that, for example, a house cannot exist 
without walls, foundation, and a roof.  But it need not entail that this house cannot exist 
without this specific roof, or this specific wall.  Interpreted strongly, the Boethian thesis 
entails a version of the contrapositive of (R) that corresponds to the essentialist 
translation (R*): “if [any] part [belonging to this house] is destroyed, [this] house is 
destroyed”.  
The Sorites appeals to a number of instantions of rule (R) in order to derive an 
extreme form of mereological essentialism.  The argument is given in several versions in 
the literature.  The following version is presented by Joscelin (De gen. et spec. §3): 
1. If the house is, the wall is. 
2. If the wall is, half the wall is.  
3. If half the wall is, half of the half of the wall is. 
4. etc. 
                                                 
228 Joscelin also notes that it is unclear whether the rule is a general or particular statement.  He claims that 
the rule, when interpreted generally is true.  The rule is false only when it is applied to a “determinate 
whole” (De gen. et spec. §4).   I find this remark somewhat baffling since I don’t know how it could be true 
universally that if wall is destroyed, house is destroyed, when in a particular case I can destroy this wall and 
yet not destroy this house. 

 
 
 
249
After numerous, but finite steps, we reach the whole that is composed of two stones in the 
wall, and this whole is a proper part of the wall. 
n. If the whole of two stones is, the stone is. [Rule (R).] 
o. If the house is, the stone is. [From premises 1 to n.] 
p. Suppose the stone is destroyed, so that the stone is not. 
q. If the stone is not, the house is not.  
 
If (q) is read as saying ‘if any stone of this house is destroyed this house ceases to exist’, 
then it appears that any loss or gain of a part entails generation or corruption.   
The Sorites challenges the intuitive view that things can gain and lose parts.  
There are three general positions that one can adopt with respect to this Sorites: 
1.  No Change: one can deny that things gain or lose parts.   
 
2.  Moderate: one accepts that things gain and lose parts.  The loss of some parts 
entails the destruction of the thing; but the loss of other parts does not entail the 
destruction of the thing. 
 
3.  Extreme Change: things lose and gain parts, and any loss or gain of parts 
entails the destruction of this whole (and perhaps the generation of another). 
 
The No Change position denies that a problem exists, since the antecedent assumption of 
the Sorites never obtains.  To my knowledge no twelfth-century philosopher embraces 
this position.  The Extreme Change position, in contrast, does appear to have its twelfth-
century adherents: most notoriously the so-called Nominales, who held the position that 
nothing grows (see 4.3.4).  Abelard explicitly holds the Extreme position in the case of 
artifacts.  But in the case of persons I argued he is a Moderate.  The greatest interpretive 
difficulty, the reader will recall, is whether Abelard is a Moderate or an Extremist with 
respect to non-human, primary substances.   

 
 
 
250
The Moderate position is the intuitive position.  It accords with our common 
notions about the nature of medium sized objects—both substances and artifacts.  Yet, 
the Moderate position has the toughest task, since its advocates must find a principled 
reason to resist the Sorites. 
 
5.1.2: Moderate responses to the Sorites 
Medieval Moderates attack the Sorites by attempting to find some principled way 
to halt the series of conditional entailments.  There are two basic ways they attempt to 
accomplish this.  The first way is to claim that there is a crucial equivocation of a middle 
term within the argument that undermines its validity.  The second way they attempt to 
halt the regress is by rejecting the strong translation (R*).  Usually this is done by 
challenging the assumption that the persistence of a whole is solely determined by the 
persistence of its parts.  I will examine each strategy in turn.  
 The first Moderate strategy is to claim that the Sorites is invalid due to an 
equivocation of a middle term. For example, the Moderate sometimes argues that the 
middle term in premises (2) and (3) is equivocal.  In (2) the half wall is a part.  In (3), 
however, the half wall is a whole.  A whole is not a part.  Therefore, if premise (2) is true 
and the half wall is a part, rule (R) should not license premise (3).   
This strategy will not work.229  By the same argument, one could not infer the 
following proposition (b) from proposition (a): 
a. If Socrates is a man, Socrates is an animal. 
                                                 
229 Abelard points this out in his discussion of the Mereological Sorites (Dial. 551.18-552.6).  Abelard uses 
the Mereological Sorites in his discussion of principal parts.  

 
 
 
251
b. If Socrates is an animal, Socrates is a substance. 
Just as the middle term in the Sorites is putatively equivocal, the middle term shared by 
propositions (a) and (b) is equivocal.  The term animal in the first premise is a genus.  
The term animal is a species in the second inference.  Since, not every genus is a species, 
it seems that we must (by the Moderate’s lights) insist that the argument will not go 
through.  But even this type of Moderate, Abelard insists, will want to claim that 
premises (a) and (b) form part of a valid argument. 
This criticism of the Moderate rests upon two assumptions, one which is 
orthodox, and one which is more controversial.  The orthodox assumption is that ‘part’ 
and ‘whole’ are relatives.  There is nothing objectionable, pace the Moderate, about 
claiming that the half wall can be both a whole and a part.  The more controversial 
assumption is that any collection of objects counts as a whole.  The half of the wall, he 
reasons, can be divided into parts—in particular, into this half of the half and that half of 
the half wall.  Anything that can be divided into parts has parts, and anything that has 
parts is a whole (for whole and part are correlative notions).  Hence, the half of the wall 
is a whole.  Indeed, the only item in the Sorites that might plausibly not be a whole is the 
stone.  As we have already seen, this more controversial assumption is embraced by 
Abelard (4.1.3). 
Abelard’s controversial assumption is not universally held by his eleventh and 
twelfth-century contemporaries.  Indeed, Abelard’s liberal understanding of what can 
count as a whole is at one point excoriated in a colorful fashion:  

 
 
 
252
In the face of this opposition, Master P[eter] was forced [by his own principles] to 
claim that he and the queen of France are one body, as well as he and Mount 
Appenninus.230   
 
This passage does not give a philosophical reason for rejecting the claim that any odd 
collection of items constitutes a whole, but one can be given.  As I pointed out in chapters 
2 (2.3) and 3 (3.1.1), the term ‘part’ as it is used in ordinary language is multivocal, and 
often the sense of ‘part’ employed in a particular discourse is more restrictive than the 
mereologists formal sense of ‘part’.  Likewise, the sense of ‘whole’ that we are most 
interested in is often more restricted than the contemporary mereologist’s notion of a 
mereological sum. 
Abelard’s notion of a whole, at least in this context, aligns quite well with the 
mereologist’s notion of a mereological sum.  But the wholes that we care about are 
generally more structured than mereological sums.  Houses are importantly different from 
piles of boards, bricks and nails; Socrates and Fluffy the cat are importantly different 
from hunks of flesh, bone and blood.  The former types of entity are different from the 
latter in two crucial senses.  First, the former types of entity can be complete or 
“mutilated” (recall my remarks about kolobos in 3.3.4).  A house without one of its walls 
is a damaged house.  A man who is missing a hand or a foot is an incomplete or mangled 
man.  It is unclear what it would mean for a pile of house parts or organic parts to be 
mutilated.  This is the case because the former types of entity possess recognizable forms, 
or structures, as well as functions.  There is no form that corresponds to half-walls and 
                                                 
230 Introductiones Montanae maiores, 69rb.  This quote is quoted by De Rijk (1966, 16).   

 
 
 
253
hunks of matter.231  Abelard’s second, controversial assumption glides over these key 
differences.  Thus, while the initial Moderate charge of equivocation fails because it 
falsely assumes that no item can be both a part and a whole, the underlying idea—that 
there is some distinction that must be drawn between structured composites and 
unstructured composites—should be taken seriously.  This intuition is picked up and 
developed by the second Moderate strategy.   
The more successful strategy of the Moderate is to challenge the claim that, if this 
whole exists, necessarily any part of the whole exists.  This claim is too strong, the 
Moderate charges, since it assumes that the only available criterion for determining the 
identity and persistence of a whole is an extensional criterion.  An extensional criterion is 
appropriate, perhaps, for uncontroversial instances of discrete wholes—that is to say, for 
what Abelard calls collections and aggregates.  But even Abelard, who holds that artifacts 
are discrete wholes, admits that a purely extensional criterion—the enumeration of an 
artifact’s parts—is not the end of the story (4.3.1).  A form or structure is also required. 
The notion of form contains at least two aspects, which crucially must be 
disentangled.  First, the form of a thing suggests an identifiable shape or arrangement.  
This first aspect of form, by itself, will not carry enough weight to count as a condition 
                                                 
231 Some neoplatonists reject the notion that the parts of a thing have forms.  See Syrianus In Metaph. 
107.16-18.  The passage is discussed by Gersh (1978, 88-89).  This a fairly strong Aristotelian reading of 
‘form’.  In a weaker sense, many parts do in fact structure (and function).  In this weaker sense, form 
admits of degree.  Consider my bold claim that the wall is an item with a structure, or form, whereas the 
half-wall lacks a form.  On closer examination, this claim is not obvious.  Depending upon how one divides 
the wall in two, it might turn out that the half-wall has a significant amount of structure, consisting of a 
highly engineered arrangement of joists and nails.  Or, if the wall is composed of irregular stones, the half-
wall may be a carefully arranged composite, each stone carefully placed so as to form a seamless surface.  
In general, determining when a thing has enough structure to count as a whole is a messy affair.  The ends 
of the continuum are clear paradigms—the house clearly has structure, the pile clearly lacks it—but the 
items in between admit of vagueness.

for persistence.  Many things that lose parts will preserve a good deal of perceptible 
formal structure (call it F-structure), and yet fail to persist as an F.  The cup with a tiny 
but effective hole in its bottom will preserve a good deal of cup-structure, yet it is not a 
mutilated cup.  It fails to be a cup because of the second crucial aspect of form.   
The Aristotelian concept of form contains not only the notion of shape and 
structure, but also function.  On the functional analysis, a wall would persist so long as 
the composite that lost a part remains capable of supporting the house.  A chipped cup 
remains so long as the thing left after the chipping can still fulfill the function of a thing 
that holds liquid for the purpose of drinking.  A functional criterion is, for this reason, a 
promising avenue for determining whether something is mutilated, as opposed to 
destroyed.  The Sorites could thus be halted by claiming that the loss of any stone does 
not compromise the functionality of the wall, let alone the house.  Granted, the loss of a 
load-bearing part of the wall might compromise the wall, and if the wall is a load bearing 
wall, hence the house.   But as a universal rule, (R*) is false. 
This strategy for dissolving the Sorites is employed by Joscelin.  Joscelin chooses 
to make the point by drawing a distinction between “principal” parts and secondary 
parts.232  Joscelin insists that rule (R) holds in some cases, but not in others.  The rule 
                                                 
232 Joscelin and other twelfth-century Moderates probably lifted this terminology from another context, a 
scholastic debate about which Abelard reports (Dial. 549.3-553.7).  The dispute, as Abelard reports it, is 
over how one determines the immediate branches of a logical division.  Abelard has just finished discussing 
Boethius’ rule that just as the division of a genus into species must occur by applying the appropriate 
differentiae in the appropriate order, so too the division of a whole must be brought about by making the 
appropriate cuts in the appropriate order (Dial. 548.29-549.3).  A word, for example, must first be divided 
into syllables, then syllables into letters.  A word is not properly divided if it is immediately divided into 
letters.  The letters are strictly speaking parts of the parts of the word.  The rule is understood by Abelard to 
be wholly general.  He thus raises the question of how it is that we determine the parts which are principal 
and the parts which are secondary.  According to Abelard there are two competing positions defended in 
the schools: the “constitutionalists” (secundum constitutionem) and the “destructivists” (secundum 

 
 
 
255
holds when a “part principal in essence” is removed, but not when a secondary part is 
removed.  A part principal in essence is distinguished from both a part principal in 
quantity and a secondary part (De gen. et spec. §§ 6-8):  
Moreover, it should be established that some parts of a continuous whole are 
principal, and others are secondary.  Some principal [parts] are principal in 
essentia, others are principal in quantity, and still others are principal in both 
[manners].  A part principal in essentia is one which when destroyed destroys its 
whole. For example, Socrates’ heart or brain when destroyed destroys Socrates.  
The lower half of Socrates (or the upper half) is a part principal in quantity.  
Socrates’ half contains more of the whole body than his foot or his hand.  
Nonetheless, when the lower half of Socrates is destroyed, it does not destroy 
Socrates.  This is because the heart and the brain, which are parts principal in 
essentia, remain in the upper part.233 
                                                                                                                                                 
destructionem).  The constitutionalist position closely follows the letter of Boethius’ rule: the principal 
parts of a whole are those parts that only belong to the whole.  Thus, the parts of the parts of a whole are 
not principal parts (Dial. 549.6-7).  Abelard makes short work of the constitutionalist position by 
demonstrating that in most cases, putative principal parts are in fact parts of parts (549.21-27).  Any whole 
with more than two atomic parts allows for putative principal parts to be parts of parts.  For example, a 
whole {a + b + c} has no principal parts, since a << {b + c}, b << {a + c}, and c << {a + b}.  The 
destructivist criterion echoes that proffered by Joscelin: “principal [parts] are those which destroy the 
substance of the whole” (549.9-12).  In a long, convoluted string of arguments, Abelard attempts to 
demonstrate that any part will be a principal part.  It follows from this that the destructivist falls prey to the 
Sorites, with the terrible result that one commits homicide whenever a fingernail is clipped (552.6-14).  
Abelard’ critique of the destructivist can be overcome by appealing, as Joscelin does, to the functional 
criterion in tandem with the genetic criterion. 
233 The author of the Introductiones presents a less satisfying version of the distinction between principal 
and secondary parts:  “The rule is given: if the part is destroyed, the whole is destroyed.  If we say this 
generally of any part whatsoever, it is false, because when the hand is destroyed, the man is not destroyed.  
Therefore, it should be understood of principal [parts]—whether (1) they be parts principal with respect to 
essentia (for there are some tiny parts which when they are destroyed, the whole is destroyed—e.g. a heart 
or a brain), or (2) they be principal with respect to quantity (such as walls, the roof, etc.).”  (71va: Et datur 
regula: destructa parte destruitur totum.  Si dicamus generaliter de qualibet parte, falsum est, quia 
destructa manu non destruitur homo.  Unde de principalibus est intelligendum, sive sint principales partes 
secundum essentiam (sicuti quaedam sunt partes minutissimae quibus destructis destruitur totum, ut cor et 
cerebrum), sive sint principales secundum quantitatem sicuti paries, tectum et caetera.)  The author of the 
Introductiones proposes that both parts principal in essence and parts principal in quantity entail the 
destruction of the whole when they are destroyed.  The author’s claim that both quantitative and essential 
principal parts entail the destruction of the whole is dangerously ambiguous.  The author may merely mean 
that, since houses are quantitative wholes, their principal parts must be quantitative principal parts.  The 
quantitative principal parts of the house will be those parts which when removed destroy the house.  (After 
all, the author of the Introductiones assigns the parts of houses to the quantitative side of the divide.  This is 
perhaps because the author of the Introductiones follows Abelard in denying that artifacts are substances.)  
But other philosophers insist that things can have both quantitative principal parts and essential principal 
parts.  Certainly, 50 pound chunks of Socrates’ body are quantities.  And given how large these quantitative 
parts are, they appear to be principal quantitative parts.  Surely if these quantitative portions of Socrates 

 
 
 
256
Joscelin goes on to make it clear that parts principal both in essentia and in quantity are 
reducible to parts in essentia.  An example of this third sort of principal part is the upper 
half of Socrates.  If the upper half is destroyed, Socrates is destroyed; but this is due to 
the fact that the heart and brain (which are contained in the upper half of Socrates) are 
destroyed (§10). 
Joscelin argues that rule (R) should be modified to say: If the whole is, then any 
part principal in essence exists (De gen. et spec. § 12):  
We therefore concede this consequence ‘if this house is, this wall is’, since its 
wall is principal in essentia.  But we do not accept the [consequence] ‘if this wall 
is, this half wall is’.  This is because we do not know whether this half wall is a 
part essential (essentialis) to this house. 
  
Destroying half the wall could have one of two consequences.  The destruction of the half 
wall could entail the collapse of the entire wall.  Or the wall could merely be mutilated, 
yet remain a wall.234  To illustrate his point Joscelin presents the following example of a 
wall made from four stones (De gen. et spec. § 16): 
Let us suppose that a wall consists of four stones and that each half wall is 
composed out of two [stones].  It is possible to destroy one of the two halves by 
removing one stone and yet have the wall continue to exist in the three stones.  
We concede that in the case of the subtraction of a half of the wall in this manner 
that the wall is not destroyed.  The subtraction was such that that which remains 
suffices as the essentia of a wall.  If it is subtracted in such a manner that the 
                                                                                                                                                 
count as principal quantitative parts, Socrates can lose a principal quantitative part and yet persist through 
the loss.  If a 200 pound Socrates goes on a severe diet and loses 50 pounds, it better not be the case that 
Socrates ceases to exist when the pounds are shed. Joscelin’s formulation of the distinction in principal 
parts is superior to the Introductiones formulation, because it readily accords with our intuitions in the 
obese Socrates case.  Joscelin also allows us to claim that artifacts, such as a house or a wall, can have parts 
principal in essentia. 
234 Or as Joscelin puts it, “its form is changed even though some of its parts remain” (§ 13).  It should be 
noted that Joscelin is sloppy in his use of the term forma.  Sometimes, as in this passage, the term means 
something like ‘appearance’ or ‘shape’.  In other passages, forma refers to a thing’s Aristotelian form—i.e. 
its substantial differentia or accidents.  Below we will use the term ‘form’ exclusively in the latter sense. 

 
 
 
257
remainder cannot make a wall (whether anything is added or not), the same thing 
cannot remain a wall.   
 
If the top stone is destroyed, the remaining three stones can be a wall.  And so, while the 
half wall is destroyed, the wall is not destroyed.  The wall is only altered in its 
appearance.  But if the stone at the very bottom were destroyed, the wall would collapse, 
and the same three stones would cease to be a wall.  The top stone is, hence, at best a part 
principal in quantity.  The bottom stone is a part principal in essentia.   
The example of the wall demonstrates that Joscelin’s use of the distinction 
between principal parts and secondary parts is underwritten by the formal/functional 
criterion.  In the above example, if the top stone is knocked away, the form and function 
remain, and thus the wall remains in its essence.  If the bottom stone is destroyed, the 
wall is destroyed because the remaining mereological sum no longer possesses the 
requisite form and function.  Thus, Joscelin’s use of parts principal in essence is 
shorthand for an appeal to the formal criterion.  
Employing this distinction, Joscelin also suggests instances where unstructured, 
integral collections are immune to the Sorites.  For example, Joscelin suggests that 
collections of primary substances are often not susceptible to the Sorites.   At first blush it 
appears that all aggregates and collections are defined extensionally, and accordingly that 
the Sorites should go through (De gen. et spec. § 17): 
For example, it is true to say that if this flock is, then this bird is, and I understand 
this determinate flock—i.e. 10 birds or some other determinate number.  And I 
can posit [the existence of] any one of these ten upon positing the whole flock.   
 
If any one of the birds were to perish, then the determinate flock of ten would not remain.  
Nonetheless, Joscelin argues, the Sorites does not go through, because it is not true that if 

 
 
 
258
any part of any of the ten birds is destroyed, the whole thereby ceases to exist.  It is only 
true that if the flock of ten exists, the essential parts of the birds exist.  For example, it is 
true that if this flock of ten exists, then this bird’s heart exists.  But it is not necessarily 
true that if this flock is, then this feather exists (§ 18).  Joscelin also thinks that universal 
wholes are a special sort of unstructured, integral collection, yet universals are not 
susceptible to the Sorites.  We will look at this extension of Joscelin’s Moderate position 
in section 5.2.  The only case where Joscelin might allow that the Sorites works is the 
case where the whole is defined extensionally and the parts are either atomic, or are 
constructed in such a way that any part of a part is an essential principal part.  Thus, even 
integral collections such as Mount Appeninus, Abelard and the Queen of France are not 
subject to the mereological Sorites.235 
The formal/functional criterion might well halt the Sorites as stated.  But allow 
me to press the Moderate to look beyond merely answering the Sorites and to provide a 
comprehensive solution to the puzzle of persistence.  Looking beyond the Sorites, the 
formal criterion by itself does not provide a fully adequate criterion for persistence.  
Consider another scenario.  At time 1 there is a house, my house, replete with all of my 
decorative additions.  At that moment, God completely annihilates my house and 
immediately creates in that very same spot a house that possesses the same blueprint and 
decorative marks.  The appearance is the same, and the function is the same.  But one 
should, I think, argue that my house—the one that existed at time 1—did not survive 
God’s act.  The formal, functional criterion tells us why the collapsed pile of house-parts 
                                                 
235 It is not clear whether Joscelin would allow these arbitrary mereological sums to be classified as wholes.  

 
 
 
259
is no longer a house, while the house that has a chip on its threshold persists.  But this 
criterion seems to get the wrong answer in the Divine home-wrecker scenario.  
The best Moderate responses to the Mereological Sorites insert an additional 
feature into their accounts of persistence that will block the Divine home-wrecker 
scenario.  One such refined version of the Moderate objection can be found in the 
anonymous Introductiones Montanae maiores.  The author of the Introductiones 
examines the following version of the Sorites.  Let ‘a’, ‘b’ and ‘c’ be the names of stones 
in the wall of a house. 
(i) If a is destroyed, the whole consisting of a and b does not exist. 
(ii) If the whole consisting of a and b is destroyed, then the whole consisting of a, 
b and c does not exist. 
(iii)And so forth, until one has destroyed the wall itself. 
 
The wall is an uncontroversial part of the house, and once the wall is destroyed, by rule 
(R) the house destroyed.  Hence the Sorites is generated. 
The author of the Introductiones replies that it is false that when a is annihilated 
the whole consisting of a and b is annihilated.  On the other hand, it is true that the whole 
consisting of a and b “does not remain the same whole, that is in the same property of 
whole with respect to all the parts” (my emphasis).236  This phrase suggests that the 
structural criterion is being appealed to.  The author’s elaboration indicates that the 
functional criterion is also at work. 
For the whole consisting of this stone and the other does not remain in the same 
property of whole when the first stone, which was a principal part of the whole 
consisting of this stone and the other, is annihilated.  We do not speak strictly 
[when we say] ‘this whole remains when that stone, which was a principal part of 
that [whole], is destroyed’, because that whole [sc. the one consisting of this stone 
                                                 
236 Introductiones 72ra: non remanet idem totum ac in eadem proprietate totius secundum omnes partes. 

 
 
 
260
and the other] is altogether nothing.  Rather is it said that this whole remains 
because some of its parts remain, just as a king is said to remain in his sons even 
though he is destroyed, because some son of his lives and maintains his father’s 
kingship.237 
 
The father’s kingship is clearly identified in part by its function.  And in so far as the 
example of the king and his sons is meant to illuminate the persistence of a whole, it 
appears that persistence requires functional continuity.  Yet something additional is at 
work in this passage.  In fact, two different additions are proposed.   
First, the author of the Introductiones suggests that the further condition needed 
for persistence is mereological continuity.  
1. A whole persists if and only if some part of that whole persists. 
In other words, the author is suggesting that persistence requires not mereological 
constancy, but rather mereological overlap through time.  Yet, mereological continuity 
will not adequately complete the Moderate criteria for persistence.  First, it is not clear 
how many parts may be replaced in my house before it begins to look like the Divine 
home-wrecking scenario.  For example, is it sufficient that only one part of the original 
house remain, while God immediately replaces all the other parts with proxies?  Can He 
leave a wall and replace the rest?  How about half the house?  It is not clear where the 
threshold lies, after which God’s act is no longer remodeling, but rather an act of 
                                                 
237 Introductiones 72ra: Primo enim lapillo annihilato qui principalis pars erat illius totius constantis ex 
illo lapillo et ex alio, totum constans ex illo lapillo et ex alio non remanet in eadem proprietate totius.  Nec 
ut proprie loquamur, illo lapillo destructo qui principalis pars erat illius, istud totum remanet, cum omnino 
illud totum nihil sit.  Sed dicitur illud totum remanere cum remanet aliqua partium illius, ut tyrannus 
dicitur remanere in filiis suis eo etiam destructo, cum aliquis filius illius tyranni in patris tyrannide 
remanens vivit. 

 
 
 
261
destruction and creation.238  Moreover, the added criterion (1) does not accord well with 
our intuitions about organisms.  In contemporary discussions of persistence, it is 
commonly asserted that during the average lifetime of a human being, every atom in that 
human’s body has been replaced (e.g. Aune 1985, 83).  Thus, over the ordinary span of 
growth and metabolism Socrates would persist even though no part that he originally 
possessed is now present as a part of him.  
Fortunately, the passage in the Introductiones suggests a more promising addition 
to the functional criterion.  The crucial clue again lies in the author’s analogy to a king 
and his kingdom.  The analogy suggests the following: 
2. A whole persists if and only if there is historical and causal continuity between 
different mereological sums that compose the whole.   
 
Notice that this is a looser criterion than the first proposed addition.  Socrates’s adult 
body may not share any matter with Socrates’ body at the age of one year, but there is a 
clear historical and causal trajectory that links the two mereological sums of matter, and 
which licenses the claim that Socrates persists.  Socrates’s body has a unique creative 
origin: when his soul is first tied to matter at conception.  Each proceeding sum of matter 
is developed following a unique, historical trajectory.  Each sum of matter is causally 
linked to previous sums by the fact that have each been at some time incorporated into 
this living organism bound up with this soul.  Socrates’ body persists, on this account, so 
long as each sum helps trace the trajectory of a unique life-line.  Let us call this second 
criterion the genetic criterion. 
                                                 
238 Joscelin suggests that there is a threshold below which a “nature”—i.e. natural substance—is no longer 
such and before which there is no nature (De gen. et spec. §23). 

 
 
 
262
Armed with the combination of the functional criterion and the genetic criterion 
the author of the Introductiones resists the Sorites by insisting that, while a whole does 
“not remain in the same property of whole”—where he means that the whole is no longer 
this particular mereological sum—that whole can nevertheless survive the loss or gain of 
a part: 
But it is true if it is said that when the whole consisting of two stones is destroyed 
the whole consisting of three is destroyed [provided that we mean] the whole 
consisting of two stones is annihilated and the whole consisting of three stones 
does not remain in the same property of whole.  The whole consisting of two 
stones is destroyed if these two stones are changed or disjoined.  Nevertheless, 
that [whole] consisting of three parts remains the same, but it is altered on account 
of the alteration of its parts.239 
 
The antecedent condition of premise (ii) is imagined: {a + b} is annihilated.  Hence, the 
whole that used to be the same as the mereological sum {a + b + c} is now altered, 
although “it remains the same”, which can only mean that the whole persists through the 
change while ceasing to be identical to the mereological sum {a + b + c}.  Likewise, the 
same is true for premise (i): if a is annihilated, the whole that used to be identical to the 
mereological sum {a + b} persists, but is no longer that mereological sum.  In order for 
the Sorites to go through at step (i) to (ii) the whole composed of a and b must be 
annihilated, not merely be changed so that it does not remain in the same property of 
whole.  So, the reading of the conditional premises such that the argument goes through  
                                                 
239 72ra-72rb: Sed si dicatur “destructo toto constanti ex duobus lapillis destruitur totum constans ex 
tribus”—id est annihilatur totum constans ex duobus lapillis—<et si dicatur> “destruitur totum constans 
ex tribus lapillis”—id est non remanet in eadem proprietate totius—vera est.  Destruitur enim totum 
constans ex duobus lapillis si illi duo lapides transmutentur et disiungantur.  Tamen illud constans ex 
tribus partibus idem remanet, sed alteratum propter alterationem partium. 

 
 
 
263
is false.  The true reading of the conditional premises, such that the whole identified in 
the consequent does not remain in the same property of whole, will not allow the Sorites 
to go through. 
Joscelin appreciates the need for a genetic criterion when developing a theory of 
persistence through mereological change.  He introduces the genetic criterion when 
discussing what he calls “natures” (De gen. et spec. § 123): 
I call a nature whatever (whether it is one essence or many) is of dissimilar 
creation from all others which are not that [object] or belonging to that [object].  
For example, Socrates is dissimilar in creation from all others who are not 
Socrates.  
 
I will return to examine the nature consisting of many essences in my discussion of 
Joscelin’s collection theory (5.2.4).  For now, the focus is on individual essences, such as 
Socrates.240  The reason for Joscelin’s clumsy use of the phrase “dissimilar in creation” 
will perhaps also become apparent when I discuss universal collections.  What is behind 
the phrase is nothing more than the genetic criterion as previously defined.  Socrates is 
dissimilar in creation from Plato because he has a unique point of origin, at conception, 
and each proceeding bundle of matter, forms, and soul is linked into a life with a unique 
trajectory.   
There is something further that is packed into Joscelin’s terse definition of a 
nature, for x and y are two distinct natures if x and y each have a distinct genetic origin, 
and if y does not “belong” to x.  The second clause of the disjunction ‘which are not that 
[object] or belonging to that [object]’ most naturally applies to the case where the nature 
                                                 
240 Joscelin’s notion of “essence” is similar to Abelard’s in that an essence is a concrete item.  There is a 
subtle difference, which I highlight below in section 5.2.3. 

 
 
 
264
is constituted by many essences.  But there is a sense in which it applies to individuals as 
well.  This point can be illustrated by briefly examining Joscelin’s treatment of a cousin 
of the Problem of the Many Socrateses, which we already have examined in 4.2.1 (De 
gen. et spec. § 21): 
If any two points are joined together, they make a two pointed line, which is one 
creation (creatura), and thus will possess one foundation.  One atom will not be 
its foundation, for then [the one atom] would thereupon be delineated by two 
points [which is absurd].  Therefore, it must be the case that one creation 
constituted out of two atoms is a body which this two-pointed line is founded…  
But if a third [point] is added, this creation must have a foundation.  It will thus 
have either this foundation—that is, the one where the first two-pointed line is 
founded—or another.  But it cannot have the former, since two points cannot be in 
one atom.  Thus, another foundation comes to be, composed out of the first 
foundation belonging to the two-pointed line and an additional atom.  And again 
[something] <will be added>.  
 
At first, it appears that Joscelin is describing an actual act of compounding—as if 
someone where taking atoms from a pile and forming a line out of them, each new 
compound being a “new creation”.  But the next paragraph makes it clear that Joscelin is 
imagining something different (De gen. et spec. § 22): 
By increasing in this manner and creating progressively new creations at last one 
comes across some particle of Socrates, such as a fingernail.  And you will have 
one great nature, which will be a part of Socrates and not Socrates, since the 
fingernail is not in the constitution of [the great nature].  This fingernail along 
with the great part [sc. the great nature] is a part of Socrates.  Yet when this 
fingernail is destroyed the part of the nature, for whom the fingernail is a part and 
which is the nature Socrates, is destroyed.  And thus Socrates is destroyed.  This 
great nature, which previously was a part of Socrates and not Socrates, remains as 
Socrates now that the fingernail is destroyed, and so what was not Socrates now 
becomes Socrates. 
 
Joscelin is examining the body of Socrates at some time t1.  That body is composed out 
of a set number of atoms, which together are the “foundation”—i.e. the subject—of 
Socrates’ whole quantity.  As Abelard would insist, every sub set of Socrates’ atoms also 

 
 
 
265
form some foundation for a specific quantity that is a portion of Socrates’ whole quantity.  
Now Joscelin asks us to focus upon those atoms that compose one fingernail.  This 
fingernail summed with Socrates’ body less the fingernail, the “great nature”, is Socrates’ 
body at t1.  The fingernail is not Socrates’ body, and the great nature is not Socrates’ 
body.  Now Joscelin severs Socrates’ fingernail.  {The great nature + the fingernail} no 
longer exists.  Does this mean that Socrates’ body ceases to exist at t2?  No, Joscelin 
seems to assert.  But then something equally odd must be admitted: something that was 
not Socrates’ body becomes Socrates’ body.  On the face of it, this is mysterious.   
Notice that the problem resembles the Problem of the Many Socrateses because it 
massages many of the same intuitions.  Joscelin’s puzzle differs from the Problem of the 
Many Socrateses because it considers a case of identity through change, not a worry 
about synchronic identity.   
Joscelin answers the puzzle by pointing out that the attempt to identify a thing 
with its mereological sum is the wrong way to approach the problem.  Not every 
mereological sum of atoms forms a “nature”.  Rather Joscelin insists a nature has a 
threshold sum.  Fewer atoms will not suffice, and the addition of more atoms will not 
necessarily change the nature.241  “Rather we say that only as many atoms are united as 
are sufficient for the constitution of one member.”  But it is not merely that the requisite 
threshold number of atoms is required (De gen. et spec. § 23): 
                                                 
241 Joscelin adds that arbitrary mereological sums of members—such as the sum {Socrates’ hand + 
Socrates’ throat}—are not natures (§ 25).  Indeed, Joscelin is even inclined to deny that the hand is 
properly speaking a nature.  This implies that there is strictly speaking no form for a hand.  Joscelin 
entertains the challenge that a hand, when severed, does appear to be a nature.  His reply is very 
Aristotelian: “Here a new accident is created and a new whole is made, just as it should be understood in 
the case of a corpse.” (De gen. et spec. § 28) 

 
 
 
266
In Socrates’ finger, which is one of his members, a hundred atoms are united, and 
out of these [atoms] the finger is composed.  No nature is composed out of any 
[subset] of these hundred atoms beneath the finger; rather all one hundred atoms 
are located in the finger because of the overlying form (per supervenientem 
formam).242 
 
At least for organisms, a nature is determined in part by an organizing form, which 
presumably was present at the genetic origin of the organism and has persisted through 
the lifespan of that organism.  According to Joscelin, Socrates is a composite of a 
mereological sum of material atoms (which he calls essentiolae, “little essences”),243 
Socrates’ humanity (which as we will see in 5.2.3 is a particular form, or trope), and a set 
of accidental characterstics (also tropes) that he labels “Socrateity”.244  The forms that 
make up Socrates’ S-humanity advene upon the atomic beings “as a whole”, but it does 
not inform each atom singularly.  The atomic beings are free to come and go without 
violating the integrity of Socrates’ essence, S-humanity.  Thus, in the case of organisms, 
the persistence of a substantial form combined with the right sort of matter apparently 
grounds the genetic criterion of persistence. 
All of this underlying metaphysical machinery enables Joscelin to untangle the 
current puzzle of how the great nature becomes Socrates’ body.  In his view, the puzzle 
dissipates once the situation is re-described (De gen. et spec. § 26): 
                                                 
242 I refrain from using the term ‘supervening’, lest the reader assume that Joscelin holds that forms 
supervene upon the parts in the same manner that Abelard seems to think that they do.  I insist that Joscelin 
cannot hold this view. 
243 At root, the material essence of Socrates is a sum of essentiolae, which Joscelin calls Socrates’ “hûle”—
i.e. “matter” (§152). 
244 Joscelin insists that a nature is a composite of a formal component and a material component: a 
substantial differentia is not a nature, but when it combines with a material essence, it forms a nature (De 
gen. et spec. § 175). 

 
 
 
267
When a part of Socrates is destroyed, the ones that remain do not become 
Socrates, rather Socrates becomes out of these parts.  Therefore, for this reason, 
we do not want to say that Socrates perishes, nor that a non-Socrates becomes 
Socrates.  Rather, [we want to say] only this: so long as the essence of Socrates is 
preserved, we assert on the basis of these [considerations] that Socrates is 
composed out of fewer [parts]. 
 
Joscelin does not deny that an individual can add or lose parts.  Nevertheless, persistence 
or change in a thing’s mereological sum is not the relevant criterion for determining 
whether an individual persists.  In other words, in order for a thing to persist, it need not 
be the same in being before and after change.   
At first it appears that the retention of a substantial form metaphysically explains 
this similarity in creation between stages of an individual.  Socrates gains and loses parts, 
but his Socrateity and S-humanity remain intact.  In order for the form to do its job in this 
account of persistence, it cannot be the case that forms supervene upon their matter.  If 
this interpretation were correct, then pace Abelard forms must be something over and 
above the arrangement of the material parts.   
Yet while form is the dominant factor in determining the persistence of an 
individual through change, form cannot be the sole determinant of persistence.  Socrates’ 
humanity is defined not only by the forms S-rationality and S-mortality; it is also defined 
by the material essence in which these forms inhere.  This insight, however, need not 
undermine the account of persistence presented here.  Joscelin’s conception of natures 
incorporates the notion of being not of dissimilar creation.  Thus, Joscelin should 
incorporate the genetic criterion.  While there may not be a single atom in Socrates when 
he is fifty that was present in Socrates when he was one, there is a unique historical 
trajectory that connects the matter that was Socrates at age one with the matter of 

 
 
 
268
Socrates at age fifty.  Thus, while Socrates’ humanity must have matter as its ultimate 
material essence, this matter need not be the same in being over time in order for 
Socrates’ humanity, and hence Socrates to persist.245 
Not surprisingly, the genetic criterion works well with living organisms.  It is less 
obvious that it can work in the case of artifacts.  Thus, it is no surprise that with respect to 
such items as brooms and houses, Joscelin leans more heavily upon the formal/functional 
criterion.  This alone is a significant break from Abelard.  Joscelin refuses to decide 
whether an artifact like a house is a continuous or discrete whole (§ 1).246  Artifacts may 
not possess natures.  Nevertheless, Joscelin thinks that they do possess forms, or 
“properties”,247 that are robust enough to support the distinction between essential 
principal parts and other parts (De gen. et spec. § 14): 
Whenever such a form is found in some subject (whether the quantity is increased 
or decreased), the form that was their previously remains. 
 
The destruction of the essence of an artifact depends upon which part is removed.  This 
point is made twice: first on the assumption that the artifact is a continuous whole (§§ 15-
16); second on the assumption that the artifact is a discrete whole (§ 20).  Some part 
                                                 
245 Note, however, that the historical criterion is not sufficient, since the matter might at some time take on 
a new form.  In the case of Socrates, this occurs when he dies.  The matter that constituted Socrates’ body 
now becomes a corpse (§28).  Thus, while the matter persists according to the historical continuity 
criterion, Socrates does not persist.  
246 Abelard, the reader will remember, insists that all artifacts are discrete wholes (4.1).  Perhaps Joscelin 
refuses to decide whether an artifact is a discrete or continuous whole because he acknowledges the 
difficulty that artifacts present to one’s ontology.  Artifacts may not possess natures, but they have one 
significant similarity to primary substances: unlike aggregates and collections, artifacts have structures and 
functions. 
247 This point is sometimes obscured by the fact that Joscelin sometimes uses the term ‘forma’ to mean 
‘shape’, as when he says, “I say that they are the same in essence, not in form” (§ 12).  Cf. §§ 15 and 20. 

 
 
 
269
removal will reduce the quantity of the whole and perhaps deface it, but only the removal 
of a part that eliminates the mereological sum’s ability to retain its form and function will 
entail the destruction of the whole. 
Joscelin seems to lean more heavily upon the formal and functional criterion 
when considering the persistence conditions of artifacts.  Given our previous observation 
that the formal and functional criterion on its own is not a sufficient criterion of 
persistence, Joscelin needs to extend the genetic criterion so that it can apply to artifacts.   
I see no reason why such an expansion cannot be accommodated by a twelfth-
century Moderate such as Joscelin.  As we will see in section 5.2, Joscelin extends the 
genetic criterion to cover the persistence of a special sort of discrete, integral collection—
a universal.  Most artifacts have a distinct, genetic origin.  The sword is forged.  The 
broom is assembled.  The house is built.  Once these artifacts are created, they may 
develop a historical, causally linked trajectory as well.  I may replace the carburetor in 
my car, or the windows in my house, and so long as the sum of parts retains the form and 
function of a car and a house, these two artifacts can persist through gradual changes in 
parts.248  
                                                 
248 Notice that an appeal to the genetic criterion will provide the Moderate with a definitive answer to the 
traditional puzzle of the Ship of Theseus.  As a brief reminder to the reader, the puzzle of the Ship of 
Theseus is generated as follows:  Imagine that sitting in the Athenian harbor is the ship that carried Theseus 
over to Crete and back.  The ship is then placed in the harbor as a monument to Theseus’ achievement.  But 
like most artifacts, nature takes its toll, and the ship needs replacement parts to keep it ship worthy.  Thus, 
bit-by-bit, the ship’s planks are replaced and the old ones are discarded.  But, as it turns out, the planks are 
sturdy enough that they can be recycled, and some entrepreneur decides to take the old planks away and 
begin building a new ship out of them.  At some point in the future, all the original planks have been 
replaced in the ship sitting in Athens, and these original planks have been used to build another ship in a 
harbor up the coast.  The puzzle is to determine which ship, the one sitting in the Athenian harbor or the 
one composed of the original planks is the Ship of Theseus.  Using the genetic criterion in conjunction with 
the formal criterion the Moderate should say that the Ship sitting in the Athenian harbor and composed out 
of all new planks is the Ship of Theseus.  It is the one that has had both a continuous historico-causal 
trajectory and a continuity of form and function.  The second ship, composed out of the old, original 

 
 
 
270
In combination with the functional criterion, the genetic criterion seems to 
provide Joscelin with everything that he wants.  The mereological sum after the loss of a 
part must retain the same form and function in order for the house to persist.  And the 
mereological sum after the loss of a part must have the appropriate causal and historical 
links to previous sums that constituted the house in the past.  The house created by God 
fails this second test, since it has an altogether different creative origin than my house. 
With respect to the mereological Sorites Abelard is sometimes an extremist.  In 
particular, he holds some version of mereological essentialism for not only discrete, 
integral collections—i.e. mereological sums—but also for artifacts, which he thinks are 
structured, discrete wholes.  Moderates attempt to correct Abelard by finding principled 
reasons to resist the Sorites.  We identified two criteria, what we called the formal 
criterion and the genetic criterion.  The formal criterion has an extra dimension, the 
functional dimension.  I also suggested ways in which one or the other of these two 
criteria is prior to the other.  The genetic criterion may, for instance, be underwritten by 
the formal criterion (as it seems in the case of organisms).  Other times, the formal 
criterion seems to play second fiddle to the genetic criterion.  Perhaps the best appraisal 
of the relation between the criteria is that they compliment one another, each contributing 
to a complete account of persistence, even though one criterion may be fore-grounded 
with respect to some particular type of object.  The interplay between the formal and  
                                                                                                                                                 
planks, has a different genetic origin.  The second ship began its existence as a ship when there were 
enough original parts in place to give that structured sum the form of a ship. 

 
 
 
271
functional criterion, and the genetic criterion will play a crucial role when Joscelin 
attempts to extend his theory of  persistence to cover yet another discrete, integral whole, 
the universal. 
 
5.2: The collection theory of universals 
Abelard is a Moderate with respect to human beings, and probably also with 
respect to Aristotelian substances.  Substances all fall under the broader category of 
continuous wholes.  When it comes to discrete wholes, which in his view include 
artifacts, Abelard is an Extremist.  Abelard’s views concerning discrete, integral wholes 
inform his criticisms of another theory of his day that used mereological concepts: the 
collection theory of universals. 
In chapter 3, we established that Porphyry and Boethius do not subscribe to the 
view that the universal is a special sort of integral whole (3.1.2).  Nevertheless, Boethius’ 
presentations of the theories of universals, of part-whole, and of division are filled with 
enough ambiguity that it is seemingly only a matter of time before some early medieval 
philosophers are tempted to develop a collection theory in the shadow of Boethius’ 
authority.   
It is not known when medieval philosophers began to speculate that the universal 
is a special sort of integral whole.249  Until more texts have been unearthed and made 
                                                 
249 Sometimes scholars of early medieval philosophy claim to find evidence for this view in early texts, but 
with respect to the evidence that is widely available, I think these claims are unfounded.  To give only one 
example, Marenbon raises the possibility that a thinker associated with Alcuin’s school, Fredegisus of 
Tours, holds a version of the collection theory.  In his De substantia nihili et de tenebris (c. 800 AD) 
Fredegisus makes one intriguing remark about the status of universals (Monumenta Germaniae Historica.  
Epistulae IV, Epistle 36, p. 553, 8-11):  “Every definite name—e.g. ‘man’, ‘stone’ or ‘tree’—signifies 
some thing.  When these [names] are spoken, we immediately understand the things that the [names] 

 
 
 
272
available for proper study, we will not know for certain when the collection theory was 
developed.  But we have good evidence that a naïve version of the collection theory 
emerged in school discussions of universals sometime in the late eleventh century or 
early twelfth century, for Abelard presents a famous set of arguments against the theory 
(5.2.1-2).250  It is a commonplace in histories of the problem of universals that Abelard’s 
criticisms of the collection theory were decisive.  He does not clearly mention the theory 
in his later treatment of the problem of universals.  But Joscelin shows that he is 
Abelard’s equal by presenting a spirited defense of the collection theory that overcomes 
the Abelardian criticisms (5.2.3). 
 
5.2.1: Abelard on the collection theory 
In the treatment of the problem of universals presented in his Logica 
Ingredientibus, Abelard describes a late eleventh-century or early twelfth-century version 
                                                                                                                                                 
signify.  The name ‘man’ designates the universality of men, which is posited apart from any difference 
[between individual men].  ‘Stone’ and ‘tree’ likewise embrace their [own proper] generality.”  Marenbon 
raises the question, but stops short of endorsing the interpretation that Fredegisus holds a collection theory 
of the universal (1988, 51; cf. 1981, 63).  Marenbon is correct to hesitate from wandering down this path.  
First, it is unclear whether Fredegisus believes that the “thing”, which a definite name signifies, must be a 
concrete particular.  Indeed, Fredegisus states that ‘man’ refers to the universality of men, not the collection 
of men.  Fredegisus may be referring to an immanent constituent that is present in all men, or as Marenbon 
suggests, Fredegisus may be referring to a concept in our minds.  Fredegisus’ remark about universal 
names is provocative, but inconclusive.  Occasionally John Marenbon claims to find an espousal of a 
collection theory in an early commentary on Aristotle or Porphyry.  Since these commentaries are for the 
most part buried in unpublished manuscripts, it is difficult for me to verify these claims.  My suspicion is 
that the remarks are much like Fredegisus’, and that they are equally inconclusive.  Merely describing a 
species as that which collects together its individuals is not enough for the theory to be a true collection 
theory, since the activity of “collection” may refer to a mental operation—as Boethius himself seems to 
think of it—or as class inclusion.  A true collection theory must identify the species with the concrete 
collection of its individuals—that is, the species must be an integral whole.   
250 There is the possibility that Abelard has developed a straw-man position to knock down, but I find this 
scenario extremely improbable.   

 
 
 
273
of the collection theory.  We will use his description to construct a preliminary 
characterization of the theory.  It is unclear how accurate and charitable Abelard’s 
portrait of the collection theory is.  Abelard has sometimes been accused of 
misrepresenting his opponents’ positions.  Yet it is possible that there were philosophers 
who hold the naïve version of the collection theory that we will presently sketch. 
Many, if not most, twelfth-century thinkers make a strict division between 
universal wholes and integral wholes.  But despite this common recognition of the 
distinction between universal and integral wholes, some philosophers are tempted to 
reduce universal wholes to integral wholes.  This reduction is motivated by a rejection of 
the thesis that a universal is a thing that is wholly present in many individuals such that it 
constitutes the substance of each individual (Log. Ingr. 1, 13.18-23):251 
There are others who hold another view about universals, and they come closer to 
[our] view of the matter when they say that things are not only different from each 
other in virtue of forms, but they are personally discrete in their essences.  That 
which is in one [thing] is in no manner in another thing, whether it is matter or 
form.  And it is not the case that they can subsist any less in their different 
essences when their forms are removed, since personal discreteness belongs to 
each of them. 
 
For both these philosophers and Abelard the metaphysical components of individuals are 
“personally discrete”.  There is no thing that is shared by more than one individual at the 
same time.252  For example, the humanity in Socrates, which is a component of his being, 
                                                 
251 For this formulation see Boethius (In Isag. II, 163.1-3 and 161.16-22).  The fact that twelfth-century 
philosophers reject in re universals does not entail that they also reject the existence of Divine Ideas.   
252 Of course this is not the most precise way of putting the point.  The collection theorist need not reject 
the existence of “binary products”—i.e. the part or parts that are shared by two overlapping mereological 
sums (Simons 1987, 13).  But proponents of in re universals do not have binary products (at least as they 
are normally conceived in the case of concrete physical objects) in mind when they conceive of the 
universal as some thing that is wholly present in more than one thing at a time. 

 
 
 
274
is not numerically the same thing that is in Plato.  Socrates has his humanity (S-
Humanity) and Plato has his humanity (P-Humanity), and S-Humanity is not numerically 
the same as P-Humanity.   
While collection theorists reject strong realism, they acknowledge that Socrates 
and Plato are importantly similar, and they also insist that universality is a property of 
things, as opposed to utterances (voces) (Log. Ingr. 1, 14.1-6): 
Nevertheless, they still maintain that the universal belongs to things,253 and they 
claim that discrete things are the same indifferently, not essentially.  For example, 
they say all men, while discrete in themselves, are the same in man—i.e. they do 
not differ in the nature of humanity.  And they say these same [men] are singulars 
with respect to difference, and universal with respect to indifference and the 
agreement in likeness. 
 
Abelard characterizes the collection theory as a form of indifference theory.254  Socrates 
and Plato, while numerically discrete and possessing no one thing in common, agree with 
one another in some important respect, namely in that they are both men.  Abelard notes 
that the collection theory is only one version of the indifference theory.  Some versions 
attempt to identify the particular with the universal (Log. Ingr. 1, 14.18-31).255  In 
contrast, the collection theory identifies the universal thing with an integral collection of 
particulars (Log. Ingr. 1, 14.7-11): 
                                                 
253 In other words, universality is a property possessed by things. 
254 On indifference theories consult Tweedale (1976, 111-127) and King (1982, ch. 3; and 2004, 71-72).  
These indifference theorists are classified by Abelard as realists, because they attempt to identify the 
universal with a res, but contemporary philosophers will probably categorize indifference theories as 
versions of nominalism, since indifference theorists assert that everything that (concretely) exists is 
particular.   
255 It is beyond the scope of this study to make this version of indifference theory intelligible.  For helpful 
discussion of this version, consult the sources cited in the previous footnote. 

 
 
 
275
But at this point there is disagreement.  Some find the universal thing only in the 
collection of many.  They never call Socrates or Plato per se a species.  They say 
that all men when collected together are the species that is man, all animals taken 
together are the genus that is animal, and so forth.  
 
Abelard’s description of the theory suggests that the specialissima human being is the 
collection of the individual human beings.  But as we will see shortly, assuming that 
universals are collections of individuals leads to serious problems.   
After describing the collection theory, Abelard offers a famous series of 
objections to the theory as he understands it.  For convenience of reference, I have 
marked what I take to be discrete arguments with bold, bracketed numbers (Log. Ingr. 1, 
14.32-15.22): 256 
Now let us attack the first [version of the indifference theory] that was posited 
about the collection, and [1] let us ask how the whole collection of men together 
(which is called the species) can be predicated of many –as a universal is—when 
a whole is not said of each [of its parts].  But if it is conceded that it is predicable 
of different [things] part-by-part (per partes)—because each of its parts applies to 
it—then nothing [answers] to the commonness [proper to] a universal—i.e. [that 
the universal] should exist, according to Boethius, as a whole in each [of its 
subjects], and that this [commonness proper to a universal] is divided from that 
commonness that is commonness part-by-part (for example, a crowd whose 
diverse parts belong to different men).  [2] And likewise Socrates would be said 
part-by-part of many, so that he would be a universal.  [3] Moreover, any plurality 
of men taken together would happen to be a universal, and since the definition of 
a universal or species applies likewise to them, the result would be that the whole 
                                                 
256 Abelard does not mention the collection theory in the Logica Nostrorum.  Tweedale thinks that Abelard 
instead considers a new theory of universals, which Tweedale labels the “plurality theory” (LNPS 521.21-
29): “And there are still others who appear to affirm that universals are things.  These men assign 
commonness to things by saying that the universal is one thing, the singular is another—that is to say, the 
being of the defining characteristic of one comes from what is universal, the other from what is singular.  
Thus, animal (and body) is a universal, but some animal (or some body) is not.  For according to this view 
that animal is a universal roughly means that there are many each of which is an animal.  And that this 
animal is only predicable of one roughly means that this animal is only one thing.”     It hard to understand 
what this theory amounts to, but I agree with Tweedale that it is not a version of the collection theory—
indeed, as Tweedale notes, “it may not really be a theory at all but only a sophistical way of talking” (1976, 
127).  Iwakuma suggests that the plurality theory is also discussed in the Tractatus de generali et speciali 
§§ 4-7, and the Sententia de universalibus secundum Mag. R §§ 2-3 (Iwakuma 2004, 311-12). 

 
 
 
276
collection of men contains many species.  [4] Similarly we should call any 
collection of bodies and spirits one universal, substance.  And since the whole 
collection of substances is one generalissimum, if one is destroyed while the rest 
remain, we would have many generalissima among substances.  [5] But to this 
now I retort that if the remaining collection is not a generalissimum when one 
[substance] is removed from the substances, but nevertheless a universal 
substance persists, then it is necessary that this [remaining collection] be a species 
of substance and that it possess a coequal species under the same genus.  But what 
[species] can be opposite to [the remaining collection], since the species of 
substance is either entirely contained in that [opposite], or it shares the same 
individuals with this [opposite]—just as rational animal and mortal animal [share 
individuals]?  [6] Again, every universal is naturally prior to its individuals.  But a 
collection of anything, in relation to the singulars out of which [the collection] is 
constituted, is an integral whole, and it is naturally posterior to its components.  
[7] Furthermore, in his De Divisione Boethius assigns this difference between the 
integral whole and the universal whole: a part is not the same thing that is the 
whole, but a species is always the same thing that is the genus.  But how can the 
whole collection of men be the multitude of animals? 
 
Abelard’s attacks upon the collection theory are compressed, often elliptical, and of 
varying quality.  Some of Abelard’s objections rely upon assumptions whose justification 
rests solely upon the authority of Boethius, and which the collection theorist should never 
embrace.  An example of this kind of objection is the objection marked as [7] (Log. Ingr. 
1, 15.18-22).257  In this objection Abelard appeals to Boethius’ distinction between 
universal wholes and integral wholes.  But the collection theorist is attempting to recast 
universals as integral wholes, and so she should reject Boethius’ distinction.  To insist 
that the collection theorist must assent to a strict difference between universal wholes and 
integral wholes merely begs the question.   
Even the better objections that Abelard offers are sometimes confusingly 
presented.  Therefore, rather than marching through Abelard’s objections one at a time, 
                                                 
257 Another example is Abelard’s complaint that the collection theory yields universals that are not wholly 
present in many at once (Log. Ingr. 1, 14.32-40 = [1]).  This objection relies upon a supposition that both 
indifference theorists and Abelard reject. 

 
 
 
277
which is a feat already capably performed by D. P. Henry (1984, 235-59),258 I propose to 
abstract the key objections and present an Abelardian critique of the collection theory.  
 
5.2.2: An Abelardian critique of collective realism 
In this section I will isolate and abstract the strongest forms of Abelard’s 
philosophical objections to the collection theory.  Abelard’s description of the collection 
theory indicates that the collection theorist believes the following principles:  
(I) 
A universal is an integral collection of particulars. 
(II) 
Predication is explained in terms of mereological relations between these 
particulars. 
 
Abelard assumes that the particulars that compose a universal whole are concrete 
individuals, or Aristotelian primary substances.  The second principle follows from the 
fact that the collection theorist concedes that the universal must be predicated of its 
subjects “part-by-part” (per partes).259  Assuming that universals are composed of 
individuals and that predication is part-by-part, the collection theory will attempt to 
explain sentences such as 
(1) x is F. 
(2) x is F and y is F (and x is non-identical to y) 
by paraphrasing them as 
                                                 
258 Also consult Tweedale (1976, 113-115), and King (1982, ch. 3).  For an approach that is similar in style 
to my own, consult Freddoso (1978).  Freddoso thinks Abelard’s basic objection is “that the collective 
realist conflates universals with integral wholes”, and he goes to great lengths to demonstrate that this 
objection, which gets such curt treatment by Abelard, is “actually quite strong”.  
259 The phrase is Abelard’s (Log. Ingr. 1, 14.40-15.1; quoted below).  It refers to predications that 
correspond to the type of commonness that shared objects—such as cakes—possess.  The cake is common 
to the children in the classroom only because each child has a piece of the cake (Boethius In Isag. II, 
162.16-18, and 161.21-22). 

 
 
 
278
(1*) x is (an) F because x is a part of the collection of F’s.  
 
(2*) x is (an) F and y is (an) F because x and y are both parts of the collection of 
F’s. 
 
Thus, ‘Socrates is a man’ means that Socrates is a proper part of the integral collection of 
all human beings.  Both of these principles will need modification in order to avoid the 
objections that are isolated below.   
There are three main Abelardian objections to the naïve version of the collection 
theory.  The first objection attacks the collection theory for not having an adequate way 
of discriminating between universal wholes and other integral collections.  The other two 
Abelardian objections derive from Abelard’s assumption that the identity and persistence 
conditions of unstructured, discrete wholes are extensionally defined.  Abelard challenges 
the adequacy of the synchronic identity conditions of universals by charging that 
according to the collection theorist’s characterization of universals too many things will 
qualify as universal.  Abelard challenges the adequacy of the persistence conditions of the 
collection theory based on the principle that mereological essentialism should apply to 
the collection theorist’s universal wholes.  When taken together these three objections 
charge that the collection theory cannot secure universals of the “right sort”, by which I 
mean the species, genera and accidents that Aristotelians generally recognize.  I will 
assume that the collection theorist will want to honor this Aristotelian desideratum.  Items 
that are generally not recognized as legitimate genera, species and accidents by medieval 
Aristotelian philosophers will be called deviant universals. 
The collection theorist must first provide a principled method for determining 
whether items of a particular sort can be parts of some universal or other.  Without such a 

 
 
 
279
criterion, and since the collection theorist thinks that universals are integral wholes, the 
theory seems to allow deviant universals.  For instance, as Abelard suggests, the theory 
would allow individual wholes to be universals (Log. Ingr. 1, 14.40-15.1 = [2]): 
And likewise Socrates would be said part-by-part of many, so that he would be a 
universal.   
 
Socrates is a collection of material parts and forms, all of which are particular.  
According to the collection theory, a universal is a collection of particulars.  Therefore, 
Socrates is a universal.  But Socrates is the worst sort of deviant universal, since 
admitting him as a universal violates the basic conceptual distinction between individual 
and universal. 
Deviant universals pop up even when we restrict our attention to collections of 
more than one individual.  The Abelardian assumes that all integral wholes are 
characterized extensionally and honor the mereological axiom of transitivity.  (Joscelin 
will in fact reject or modify both these assumptions, see 5.2.3.)  Consequently, it is 
generally true of integral wholes that if something is a part of a whole, the parts of that 
part are also parts of the whole.  For example, suppose that we collect together every 
human being in the world and label this collection All Humans.  All Humans has as parts 
Socrates, Plato, and other individual human beings.  But by the mereological axiom of 
Transitivity (2.3), Socrates’ finger, Socrates’ head, Plato’s head and so forth are also 
proper parts of All Humans (Freddoso 1978, 534).260  It is generally agreed that the 
species human being does not contain as parts Socrates’ finger and Plato’s foot.  
                                                 
260 Cf. Henry (1984, 239-43). 

 
 
 
280
Moreover, this deviant universal would entail deviant predications: if All Humans were 
identical to the species human being, then Socrates’ finger is a human being.  
In sum, the first problem occurs because the collection theory appears to include 
too many items as potential parts.  However the objections that isolate this problem are 
not decisive. As Martin Tweedale points out, “At best these criticisms of Abailard’s only 
show that the collection theory naturally calls for some further explanation of how 
universal collections are to be distinguished from non-universal ones.” (1976, 114)   
Suppose that there is some way to fix the collection theory so that only the right 
sorts of parts are collected together.  No deviant universals containing such parts as 
Socrates’ hands and feet are allowed.261  The Abelardian still insists that the criterion of 
synchronic identity is too weak to allow only the right collections to be universals.262 
To illustrate this problem let us simplify matters and create a finite universe with 
three inhabitants, Socrates, Plato and Cicero.  The Abelardian now challenges the 
collection theorist to give a criterion which ensures that only one collection composed out 
of these three men qualifies as the universal Human Being (Log. Ingr. 1, 15.1-4 = [3]):  
Moreover, any plurality of men taken together would happen to be a universal, 
and since the definition of a universal or species applies likewise to them, the 
result would be that the whole collection of men contains many species. 
 
                                                 
261 The first problem for the collection theory can be solved by stipulating that the parts of a universal must 
be tropes, and that the membership of a trope in a universal is determined by whether it resembles the other 
members of a universal collection in the appropriate respect.  We thereby eliminate deviant universals that 
have too many of the wrong sort of parts.   
262 Following up on the last footnote, But we can still generate deviant universals that contain too few of the 
right sort of parts.  The collective realist’s revised criterion does not guarantee that universals contain as 
parts every trope that resembles in the appropriate respect.   

 
 
 
281
The collection theorist presumably wants the collection {Plato + Socrates + Cicero} to be 
the universal Human Being.  But {Plato + Socrates} is also a collection of the right sort 
of parts, as is {Socrates + Cicero}.  Why are these two smaller collections not also 
universals?  The Abelardian sees this as a serious objection, since he cannot find another 
principle of synchronic identity aside from an extensional one.  In Abelard’s terms, 
unstructured integral collections only have identity conditions at the level of sameness 
and difference in being and number.  Universal collections, the Abelardian assumes, do 
not possess a form or structure that would allow them to have identity conditions at the 
level where states begin to play a role—such as the level where things may be the same 
or different in property.263  As the Abelardian sees it, the collections {Socrates + Plato} 
and {Socrates + Plato + Cicero} differ only in extension—or in Abelard’s words, they are 
different in being.  There is no overarching form of a universal that would show why the 
collection of three is a universal while the collection of two men is not a universal.  
The third main problem for the collection theorist, the problem of persistence, is 
suggested by the following quick quip by Abelard (Log. Ingr. 1, 15.15-18 = [6]): 
Again, every universal is naturally prior to its individuals.  But a collection of 
anything, in relation to the singulars out of which [the collection] is constituted, is 
an integral whole, and it is naturally posterior to its components.264   
 
                                                 
263 Recall that when Abelard is giving his sortal based criterion of persistence, he suggests that there is no 
legitimate sort Pile (4.3.1). 
264 The problem of persistence also underwrites several of Abelard’s other objections to collective realism, 
but unfortunately Abelard is not careful to distinguish the problem of synchronic identity from the problem 
of persistence.  In particular, I have in mind Log. Ingr. 1, 15.4-15 (= [4] and [5]).  Isolating the problem of 
persistence is further hindered by the fact that Abelard dwells upon the properties of genera and species and 
attempts to derive a contradiction from a violation of the rules that govern the relation of a genus to its 
species. 

 
 
 
282
Abelard’s complaint that the collection theory violates the rule that a whole is posterior to 
its parts seems to be an argument that rests solely on Boethius’ authority.  But as opposed 
to the argument mentioned at the very end of section 5.2.1 (= [7]), this new objection has 
some independent philosophical merit.265  If one supposes that an unstructured integral 
collection just is the mereological sum of the parts, as Abelard supposes, then it follows 
that the whole is naturally posterior to its parts.  Should a part be removed, this whole 
perishes.   
In our imagined universe inhabited by three men, the problem amounts to this: 
suppose that {Socrates + Plato + Cicero} is the universal Human Being.  At some time 
soon after, Socrates is killed.  What has happened to the universal Human Being?  Is 
Human Being now {Plato + Cicero}?  If it now is, why was {Plato + Cicero} not a 
universal before?  The structure of the argument should be familiar, since it is the general 
problem of persistence applied to the specific case of the universal Human Being.  In the 
case of structured, continuous wholes the Moderate is able to appeal to the formal and 
genetic criteria to show how different mereological sums can be the same thing over time 
and change.  But discrete, integral collections do not appear to have the requisite form or 
unique genetic origin to guarantee persistence.  Without the aid of these criteria, 
mereological essentialism applies, and so the collection theorist is forced to claim that the 
universal Human Being perishes when Socrates perishes.  This, however, is an unhappy 
result, since for Aristotelians universals are thought to be more permanent, and hence the 
                                                 
265 Tweedale in general disparages Abelard’s criticisms of collective realism.  “Abailard’s criticisms of the 
proposal are not very potent in themselves”, but he adds that this criticism “seems to cut deeper” (1976, 
114-15).  

 
 
 
283
right sort of stable object for scientific enquiry.  The collection theorist can of course 
choose to reject this desideratum, but doing so undermines a good deal of one’s 
motivation to locate universals among the members of the real (res). 
Together, these three Abelardian criticisms amount to a powerful indictment of 
the naïve collection theory.  To the best of our knowledge Abelard’s critique proved 
decisive, since this naïve version of the collection theory does not reappear in the later 
centuries of the medieval period.  Nonetheless, Abelard’s dismissal did not go 
unchecked.  There is at least one defender of a collection theory of universals who rises 
to the challenge and provides some powerful rejoinders to the Abelardian juggernaut.266  
In the next section we will look at Joscelin’s attempt to answer the Abelardian challenge 
and develop a defensible version of the collection theory.  
 
5.2.3: A new version of the collection theory 
Now that the challenges to collective realism have been presented we may turn to 
Joscelin’s version of the collection theory.  We will first present the details of his theory.  
We will then turn to the three challenges to collective realism and examine Joscelin’s 
solutions to these problems. 
                                                 
266 In fact, Joscelin’s De generibus et speciebus is one of two known twelfth-century texts that explicitly 
advocate the collection theory of universals.  The author of the Compendium Logicae Porretanum also 
holds a collection theory, but he does not attempt to clearly explicate the theory or to defend it from 
objections.  As I will shortly demonstrate, the version of the theory attacked by Abelard seems to be more 
primitive than the versions advocated by Joscelin and the author of the Compendium.  This fact has 
prompted some commentators to hypothesize that both Joscelin and the anonymous author of the 
Compendium developed their versions of the theory with Abelard’s criticisms explicitly in mind (Martin 
1983, xix). 

 
 
 
284
Joscelin is a realist in the Abelardian sense that he identifies the universal with a 
res.267  Joscelin’s identification of the universal with a thing is motivated by his rejection 
of what he deems to be the only alternative: the universal is an utterance (vox).268  
Joscelin seems to consider only a naïve version of vocalism, one which focuses upon 
utterances as physical puffs of air.269  Utterances understood as such cannot be real.  
Following Aristotle’s dictum in the Categories, utterances are wholes that exist in 
succession.  Joscelin, like Abelard, insists that no item that exists in succession is truly 
real (De gen. et spec. § 79; Cf. chapter 4, 4.3.2).   If universals are only utterances, then 
universals are unreal.  But proposing that universals are unreal undermines Aristotelian 
logic (see §§ 78-83).  For example, if species and genera do not have reality, then 
ordering species and genera into a hierarchy loses all sense.  Ultimately, Joscelin is 
arguing that vocalism undermines the knowledge derived from definitions. 
While Joscelin identifies the universal with a thing, he rejects the view that 
universals are constituents of individuals that are wholly present in each individual (§§ 
33-47).  His own ontology, like the previously mentioned indifference theorists and 
Abelard, is particularist (De gen. et spec. § 85):  
                                                 
267 One may be an antirealist in this sense and also hold a collection theory.  There is a Twelfth century 
example of this position in the Compendium Logicae Porretanum.  The universal is a collection of singular 
forms that cause similar effects in distinct individuals (III.29, p. 50).  Nevertheless, the author of the 
Compendium does not think that this collection qualifies as a res.  When you predicate a universal of a 
subject, you signify no thing, although you do point to the form in the individual that causes a particular 
effect (I.12, p. 6; cf. Martin 1983, xxiii). 
268 Abelard famously rejects this dichotomy, insisting that the universal is neither a vox nor a res, but an 
utterance in so far as it signifies (a sermo). 
269 What goes around comes around.  Joscelin’s rejection of vocalism relies upon a naïve version of the 
theory, just as Abelard’s rejection of the collection theory relies upon a naïve version of that theory.  The 
irony of this situation is highlighted by Peter King (1982, ch. 3). 

 
 
 
285
Each individual is composed out of matter and form.  For example, Socrates is 
composed out of the matter man and the form Socrateity, and Plato from a similar 
matter (i.e. man) and a different form (i.e. Platonity), and so forth for each man.  
And just as Socrateity, which constitutes Socrates formally, never exists apart 
from Socrates, the essence of a man270 that sustains Socrateity in Socrates never 
exists except in Socrates.   
 
Each individual is a combination of a ‘material’ component and a ‘formal’ component. 271  
Each component is itself particular and unique to the individual.  The matter and form of 
an individual such as Socrates are each themselves complex.  Socrateity is possibly a 
complex of various accidental forms unique to Socrates.272  Socrates’ human essence is 
further analyzable into its own material and formal components—i.e. this animal essence 
                                                 
270 Illa hominis essentia.  Joscelin indicates later in his treatise that strictly speaking  ‘man’ refers to the 
collection of essences, and that the essences themselves have no name (§ 130, §§ 104-108).  In everyday 
speech, Joscelin acknowledges that we often use ‘man’ to refer to the particular essence present in Socrates 
and that this equivocation is relatively harmless. 
271 No twelfth-century philosopher as far as I know holds a contemporary version of the bundle theory 
where individuals are constituted out of tropes plus a primitive “compresence relation”.  Only the ninth-
century philosopher Eriugena subscribes to a theory that resembles a bundle theory (Periphyseon III. 712b; 
and III. 713c).  A common theory of the twelfth century is a trope theory where individuals are constructed 
out of a material substrate (which itself may be a mereological sum of material parts) and tropes, or as they 
would say, “forms”.  Abelard and Joscelin both seem to hold something like this theory (see Joscelin’s 
description of the construction of Socrates out of “little essences” (essentiolae) at §§144-153).  According 
to David Armstrong, the trope plus substrate theory of metaphysical composition is the most plausible form 
of contemporary trope theory (Armstrong 1989, 116 and 136; Armstrong 1997, 24-25).  
272 The author of the Compendium Porretanum also holds that there are “proper qualities”, and that these 
qualities explain the difference between individuals.  Neither Joscelin nor the author of the Compendium 
gives us a detailed account of the constitution of these proper qualities.  There are compelling reasons to 
wish that Joscelin does not identify Socrateity with a complex of Socrates’ accidents.  Abelard has 
presented a convincing series of arguments against the view that accidents are the principle of individuation 
(Log. Ingr. 1, 63.31-64.19; cf. Gracia 1984, 204-210).  Perhaps these proper qualities are haecceities.  More 
promising is this suggestion: for Joscelin and the Porretani singularity and individuality, like all difference, 
is taken for granted.  Both authors hold that every thing and every component of a thing is already 
particular.  The only task in there view is to account for sameness.  The only consideration that might short-
circuit this final suggestion is that both Joscelin and the Porretani take the resemblance between tropes to 
be primitive.  

 
 
 
286
and the differentia rationality, mortality and two-footedness (§ 85).273  This analysis of 
the individual’s material component resolves down to what Joscelin identifies as “matter” 
(or later hûle) and “the ability to receive contraries” (§ 87).274  Each component of these 
components is also particular and unique to the individual that it composes.  The 
metaphysical analysis of an individual never reveals a universal thing that is present as a 
whole in several individuals at once. 
Joscelin rejects the versions of indifference theory that attempt to identity the 
universal with the individual (§§ 50-72).  The universal thing is a collective integral 
whole (De gen. et spec. § 85): 
Therefore, I say that the species is not solely the essence of a man that is in 
Socrates or in any other individual; it is the whole collection derived from each of 
these matters.  That is, it is one [thing]—a flock so to speak—conjoined from the 
essence of a man which sustains Socrates plus each of the other [essences] of this 
nature. 
 
Notice immediately that Joscelin identifies the species with a collection of “essences”, 
not a collection of individuals.275  Here Joscelin’s use of the term ‘essence’ takes on a 
slightly different sense than that of Abelard.  The “essence which sustains Socrates” is a 
concrete thing, and it is a composite of a material component and a formal component.  
                                                 
273 Hence, Joscelin takes Boethius’ remark that the genus is also a part of the species literally.  Definitional 
parts are given a robust metaphysical underpinning.  The sense in which the species is a part of the genus 
will require a bit more subtlety.  
274 Later in his treatise, Joscelin combines this analysis with his mereological analysis of individuals (§§ 
144-153).   
275 Compare D. C. Williams: “For all the paradoxes which attend the fashionable effort to equate the 
universal Humanity, for example, with the class of concrete men (including such absurdities as that being a 
featherless biped is the same as having a sense of humor) disappear when we equate it rather with our new 
set, the class of abstract humanities –the class whose members are not Socrates, Napoleon, and so forth, but 
the human trope in Socrates, the one in Napoleon, and so forth.” (1953, 10)  This move to metaphysical 
constituents squelches Freddoso’s attack upon the collection theory. 

 
 
 
287
But Socrates’ essence is not Socrates, rather it is a metaphysical constituent of Socrates.  
What apparently must be added are the features that Joscelin identifies as his Socrateity.  
The part of Humanity, Socrates’ contribution to the universal collection, is not Socrates 
but instead Socrates’ humanity.  Socrates’ humanity is itself a compound of a substantial 
form, rationality, plus what he calls a “material essence”.  It is crucial that the reader 
remember that each component of a material essence is itself particular.  Joscelin has 
hypostasized the elements in the Tree of Porphyry: an individual substance is a 
compound of a material substrate and layer upon layer of ever more specifying tropes.  
Joscelin’s insistence that the proper parts of a universal collection are the essences 
of individuals, and not the individuals themselves, helps him avoid Abelard’s complaint 
that Socrates’ hands and feet will be proper parts of the species human being.  Socrates’ 
left hand is not a part of his essence, since we could remove his hand and Socrates’ 
essence will still persist.  Indeed, as I demonstrated above, Socrates will persist in virtue 
of the fact that Socrates’ essence persists.  Ultimately Socrates’ essence will persist so 
long as Socrates’ substantial forms inhere in an appropriate mereological sum of 
essentiolae. 
While Socrates’ hands and feet may not be parts of Socrates’ human essence, the 
layer-cake analysis of essences entails that his human essence has some parts.  In 
particular, Socrates’ human essence is the composite {S-rationality + S-animality + an S-
body}.  Socrates’ body itself is a layered composite, ultimately consisting at any 
particular time of a sum of little essences and forms.  Why, then, aren’t these little 
essences also parts of Humanity?  In short, Joscelin still owes the Abelardian a principled 

 
 
 
288
reason why some parts of an individual are not parts of the universal collection.  I will 
return to consider Joscelin’s reply, but first I wish to finish the outlines of Joscelin’s 
theory. 
Just as the species human being is the collection of material constituents of 
individual human beings, the genus animal is the collection of material constituents of 
human essences (De gen. et spec. § 85): 
The animal that sustains the form of humanity that is in me is not essentially the 
[animal] in another of the matters of individual animals, although it is indifferent 
from that [animal present in another individual animal].  Thus, I say that this 
multitude of animal essences, which sustain the forms of each of the species of 
animal, should be called the genus.  And this [multitude] is different from the 
multitude that makes the species. 
 
For convenience, we will call the particular material components of individual human 
beings humanities, and the particular material components of humanities animalities.  
The species human being is the collection of humanities; the genus animal is the 
collection of animalities.  This analysis works all the way up to the highest substantial 
genus, Substance.276  Something analogous to this analysis explains the nature and 
ordering of universals in the non-substantial categories (§ 88).   
Note that this analysis of genera and species will violate some of Boethius’ rules 
concerning the relations between a genus and its species.  For example, according to 
Boethius, the genus is the same thing as the species.  But on Joscelin’s theory, this cannot  
                                                 
276 Joscelin is hesitant to claim that the collection of brute material essences constitutes a genus for 
independent reasons (see §§ 179 ff.).  Joscelin’s resistance is due to his attempt to honor the Aristotelian 
dictum that Being (ens) is not a genus. 

 
 
 
289
be true.  Since the collection of animalities is not identical to the collection of humanities.  
This violation need not worry Joscelin if his theory is both consistent and able to satisfy 
enough other Aristotelian desiderata. 
Joscelin’s theory does not fall prey to the pitfalls of immanent realism, because 
there is no entity that is present in more than one individual at a time.  For this reason, 
Joscelin agrees with Abelard that nothing answers to Boethius’ traditional definition of 
the universal (Abelard Log. Ingr. 1, 14.32-40).  He also accepts Abelard’s remark that the 
collection theory must analyze predication as “part-by-part” (per partes) predication.  As 
Joscelin explains, traditionally predication of a species or genus of an individual is 
analyzed as “inherence”.  While the authorities do not clearly sanction this analysis, 
Joscelin declines to challenge his opponents on this point (§§ 93 and 115).  He grants that 
predication is inherence, but notes that this does not lead to the absurd conclusion that 
‘Socrates is a man’ entails that the collection of humanities inheres in Socrates.  ‘Socrates 
is a man’ means that a part of the species inheres in Socrates (§ 93).  In general, 
predication is analyzed as follows: ‘a is F’ means that 
(1) a has some metaphysical constituent m,  
(2) ‘F’ is the name of a collection of essences that are appropriately indifferent 
from one another, 
(3) and m << F. 
 
(Condition (2) will be discussed more fully below.)  The predication of a genus to its 
species can also be analyzed adequately on this account.  For example, ‘F is G’ (e.g. 
‘Man is animal’) means that anything that is F is also G.  And this turns out true on the 
collection theory as well if the following conditions hold: 

 
 
 
290
(4) ‘F’ is the name of a collection of material essences that are appropriately 
indifferent from one another, 
(5) ‘G’ is the name of a collection of material essences that are appropriately 
indifferent from one another, 
(6) x is an F and a G because m constitutes x and m << F, and there is a material 
essence n such that n constitutes m and n << G. 
 
Strictly speaking the m’s are not proper parts of G, although all the m’s have constituents 
(the n’s) that are proper parts of G.  The mereological axiom of Transitivity cannot hold 
in the case of universal collections.   
I claimed that Joscelin’s analysis of the universal as a collection of essences 
blocks deviant universals that contain both Socrates and his hands.  Socrates is not a part 
of a universal; only his material essence (his humanity) is.  Since Socrates’ hand is part of 
Socrates, and not Socrates’ human essence, Socrates’ hand is not a part of Humanity.  
Nonetheless, a more general principle must be developed to restrict other parts, 
specifically those belonging to Socrates’ human essence, from being parts of Humanity.  
Joscelin’s answer is to appeal to what I have identified as condition (2) above.  In short, 
condition (2) must provide the reason why Transitivity fails in the case of universal 
collections, and hence why Socrates’ animal essence is not a part of Humanity.  
Condition (2), once elaborated, will also block the creation of deviant universals such as 
the collection containing Socrates’ humanity, Plato’s paleness and Brunellus’ animality 
(≠ his assinity).  In both cases, Joscelin would insist, the putative parts are not sufficiently 
“indifferent” from the other parts that are contained by the universal.277 
                                                 
277 Nothing prevents it from being a collection.  Joscelin does not reject Abelard’s unrestricted collection 
principle; he does not specifically endorse it either. 

 
 
 
291
Condition (2) needs to be clarified, since Socrates’ animality, Brunellus’ 
animality and Socrates’ humanity are both different and similar to one another.  It will 
not suffice to claim that they are insufficiently indifferent to constitute a universal 
without specifying the relevant respect.  Joscelin attempts to provide the appropriate 
respect, and thereby to provide a solution to the first main Abelardian challenge.   
The key to the Abelardian objections is the assumption that an integral collection, 
since it lacks a form, can only possess extensional criteria of identity and persistence.  In 
effect, what Joscelin is attempting to do is trying to provide universal wholes with 
enough structure to avoid the Abelardian objections.  Roughly speaking, Joscelin is trying 
to develop intensional criteria for the synchronic and diachronic identity of universal 
collections.278   
At first blush, Joscelin’s intensional criteria—especially as I originally formulated 
it in clause (2) above—might seem to appeal to brute similarity.  If this is the end of the 
tale, then Joscelin’s theory of universals is merely a version of what contemporary 
metaphysicians call resemblance nominalism.279  But resemblance is not the whole story; 
                                                 
278 Again, Tweedale anticipates this type of reply to Abelard: “[Abelard’s criticism] only forces the 
collection theory to further explain itself by providing some criterion for the identity of the universal over 
and above the mere parts that make it up.” (1976, 115) 
279 I warned the reader in chapter 4 (4.1.1) that a great deal of care must be taken when using the terms 
‘realism’ and ‘nominalism’ to characterize twelfth-century metaphysics.  Here, for instance, we discuss the 
collection theory as a version of realism; but to a comporary metaphysician the view appears to be a 
version of nominalism.  Some contemporary philosophers reserve the term ‘nominalism’ for those theories 
that deny the existence of properties period –whether they are tropes or universal properties (see Armstrong 
1989, 39-58).  With this more restricted conception of nominalism in mind, Armstrong describes the 
version of the collection theory that we are currently describing as a “trope theory + resemblance” (1989, 
119-131).   

 
 
 
292
and it should not be the whole story.280  First, as Christopher Martin notes when assessing 
the merits of the collection theory presented in the Compendium Logicae Porretanum, the 
collection theory that appeals to brute resemblance inherits the same basic problem that 
plagues all resemblance theories (1983, xlii): 
Unless, however, something is done to explicate similarity further it seems that as 
with all resemblance theories, except perhaps that which holds it to be 
conventional, we have simply replaced one obscure notion with another.  For the 
problem of universals surely arises out of a concern to say how it is that things 
may be collected together as similar. 
 
While duly noting that there is no consensus about what the ‘problem of universals’ truly 
is281, we take Martin’s objection very seriously, and we count it as a point against any 
collection theory that leans on a relation of brute resemblance.   
Second, resemblance construed as qualitative similarity will not always get the 
right parts of a universal, especially when the universal is meant to be a natural kind.  
Consider a case where the embryonic and adult forms of an organism are dramatically 
different in quality—for example, a caterpillar and a butterfly.282  Joscelin, like most of 
his Aristotelian contemporaries, focus upon the status of the genera and species of 
primary substances, or natural kinds.  Joscelin should want the essence of a Monarch 
                                                 
280 In contrast, the version of the collection theory endorsed in the Compendium Logicae Porretanum 
appears to be a straightforward version of resemblance theory.  The author of the Compendium asserts that 
all whitenesses are said to be one universal whiteness because these forms have a similar effect.  Likewise, 
all humanities are called one universal because they produce a similar effect in their subjects (III.29, p. 50).  
Compare Joscelin’s remark that some things are the same in effect, and that matter tends to be the principle 
of sameness while form is the principle of difference (§203).   
281 For example, Rodriguez-Pereyra (2000 and 2002) has recently argued that the problem of universals is 
really a problem of “the Many over One”, not the “One over Many”.  For a reply consult MacBride (2002).  
For a helpful and sober discussion of the nettle of related problems that constitute the ‘problem of 
universals’ consult Oliver’s study (1996) and Mellor and Oliver (1997).

caterpillar and the essence of an adult Monarch butterfly to be contained in the same 
universal Monarch Butterfly.  But it is hard to see what qualities the two individuals 
possess, which license their inclusion in the same collection.  
The biologists among us will retort that superficial, qualitative resemblance is not 
the sole guide to determining natural kinds.  A better criterion is similarity in genetic 
code.  While Joscelin is no twelfth-century geneticist, this biological analysis comes 
closer to capturing the way in which Joscelin expands the notion of the genetic criterion 
of persistence spelled out in section 5.1.2 to universal wholes.283 
Here is where Joscelin extends the notion of both a nature and the genetic 
criterion of persistence in order to develop his replies to the Abelardian challenge.  
Joscelin claims that proper universals will be “natures”.  Here Joscelin extends the notion 
of a nature to cover not just individual essences, but also collections of essences (De gen. 
et spec. § 123): 
I call a nature whatever (whether it is one essence or many) is of dissimilar 
creation from all others which are not that [item] or belonging to that [item].  For 
example, Socrates is dissimilar in creation from all others who are not Socrates.  
Likewise, the species man is dissimilar in creation from all other things that are 
not this species or some essence belonging to this species. 
 
Earlier, in the case of individual organisms, the genetic criterion appeared to be posterior 
to the formal criterion.  In the case of universal collections, it now appears that the 
analysis is definitively the opposite.  The key to analyzing the nature of a universal is to 
decode the version of the genetic criterion that Joscelin appeals to when he insists that the 
parts of a universal are “not dissimilar in creation”.   
                                                 
283 Both the analogy to contemporary biology and the analogy to a family, which will be presented shortly, 
were both developed in close collaboration with Peter King.  I thank him again for the many conversations 
that we have had about Pseudo-Joscelin. 

 
 
 
294
Joscelin, just as Abelard, assumes that the world divides into natural kinds.284  
These natural kinds are in no way conventional.  For theological reasons, 
conventionalism is neither needed, nor is it attractive.  In keeping with their Christian 
commitments, twelfth-century thinkers assert that the world is a well-ordered creation of 
God.285  Many medieval philosophers, furthermore, assent to the neoplatonic doctrine that 
each occupant of this world is created from a divine paradigm, template, or Idea.286  All 
human beings are copies of the divine Idea of human being, all sparrows are copies of the 
sparrow Idea, and so forth.  The individuals copied from these divine templates will be 
created in a similar manner.  Put somewhat anachronistically, they will have the same 
genetic blueprint, and will thus come to possess resembling features.  It is this similarity 
in origin that ultimately underwrites qualitative resemblances.  Thus, for Joscelin 
resemblance is not primitive; similarity in creation is the true reason why natural kinds 
are collections of material essences.287 
                                                 
284 On Abelard consult King (2004, 81-83). 
285 This basic principle allows twelfth-century nominalists to avoid the worry about conventionalism that 
plagues more “naturalistic” versions of nominalism.  Here I assume Armstrong’s conception of 
naturalism—i.e. that “the world, the totality of entities, is nothing more than the spacetime system”.  
Armstrong takes this to entail that God (at least as He is traditionally conceived in by Monotheists) does 
not exist (1997, 5).   
286 The belief in divine Ideas cuts across the traditional divide between realists and nominalists.   
287 Interestingly, Peter King interprets Abelard in a roughly similar manner.  Individuals unproblematically 
break down into natural classes, determined by objective relations of similarity.  These similarity relations 
are underwritten by a similarity in creation: “Why a given thing has some features rather than others is 
explained by how it got that way—the natural processes that created it result in its having the features it 
does…similar processes lead to similar results.” (2004, 82)   

 
 
 
295
Interpreting similarity in creation in terms of the theological cum biological model 
allows us to see just how natural the expansion of the genetic criterion of persistence 
from individual substances to universal collections is.  Consider Socrates.  At conception 
Socrates is a combination of a sperm cell and an egg cell.  Qualitatively this zygote 
shares little resemblance to the pot-bellied crank trolling around the agora of Athens.  But 
this act of conception marks the beginning of a unique life-line.  All subsequent 
mereological sums along this causal/historical trajectory will share this unique point of 
origin.  Similarly, all human beings will have a similar beginning.  They all arise from 
God’s application of the Idea of human being when creating individual substances.  No 
other individuals will have an exactly similar point of origin.  Thus, just as different 
mereological sums of matter and form share a common feature—that they are all Socrates 
at some point in his life—so different essences are all parts of the same universal at some 
point of time in the universals existence. 
We are now in a position to clarify Joscelin’s answer to the first Abelardian 
challenge.  The parts of a universal must be essences of individuals, and not the 
individuals themselves.  More importantly, the parts of a universal must have been 
created in an exactly similar manner.  This precisification of Joscelin’s criterion that the 
parts must not be dissimilar in creation is necessary to block another sort of deviant 
universal.  Otherwise, in a world inhabited by two donkeys (Brunellus and Jack) and two 
humans (Socrates and Plato) there would be no way to discount, e.g., the putative 
universal {B-animality + S-humanity + P-humanity}. 

 
 
 
296
Recall that, at first glance, the genetic requirement did not seem to distinguish 
Socrates’ humanity from Brunellus’ animality.  Neither item is an individual, and each 
item is a material essence.  Moreover, Socrates’ humanity has as a constituent Socrates’ 
animality, and Socrates’ animality and Brunellus’ animality are required to have the right 
sort of indifference in creation.   
It is true that Socrates’ humanity has a constituent that is not of dissimilar creation 
from Brunellus’ animality.  Nonetheless, Socrates’ humanity is one metaphysical level 
closer to concrete individuals than Brunellus’ animality, for Socrates’ humanity is a 
compound of animality and additional forms.  The corresponding material essence 
belonging to Brunellus is not his animality, but rather his assinity, which is a compound 
of animality and other forms.  Brunellus’ assinity and Socrates’ humanity will not form a 
nature because they are dissimilar in creation from one another: the former is created out 
of animality and donkey-making differentia, the latter out of animality and human-
making differentia.  In short, Brunellus’ animality and Socrates’ humanity are not exactly 
dissimilar in creation, since the former is a material essence of the animal-type whereas 
the latter is a material essence informed by species-making differentia. 
A similar argument explains why Socrates’ animality is not a part of Humanity.  
Socrates’ animality is a constituent of Socrates’ humanity, but it is not appropriately 
dissimilar in creation to be a part of the collection of human essences.  Each human 
essence is a composite of a particular rationality form and a particular material essence, 
an animality.  No animality as such possesses a form of rationality.  If it did, it would in 
fact be a humanity.  Socrates’ animality lacks the appropriate dissimilarity in creation to 

 
 
 
297
be a human essence, and hence a part of Humanity.  The genetic requirement blocks the 
Abelardian’s application of Transitivity.  The first criticism is thus neutralized.   
Joscelin uses his expanded version of the genetic criterion to answer the second 
challenge to the collection theory.  But he must also add a new aspect to the quasi-
structure of a universal collection.  Recall that the problem of synchronic identity 
challenged the collection theory to show why a universal cannot be created out of a 
incomplete collection of individuals.  Joscelin provides a nice version of this problem, 
now framed in terms of his use of material essences instead of individuals (De gen. et 
spec. § 114): 
A species is what is predicated in quid of many differing in number—i.e. what 
inheres materially in many.  But if this is true, then it can also be said that 
everything which is so predicated is a species, [and hence] there will be not one 
but many species humanity.  Let us suppose that there are only ten essences of 
humanity that make up this species.  I say that five of these are one species and 
the other five are another, for that which is composed out of five is predicated –
that is, it inheres materially in—many (i.e. in those five individuals that are 
materially constituted out of these [five essences]).  
 
Joscelin, after numerous qualifications and digressions, finally appeals to his criterion in 
order to block this problem (§§ 122-3): 
But if someone protests, “Therefore, the [collection] constituted out of five 
essences is a species, for this [collection] inheres materially in many…”, I 
respond that it is nothing of the sort, since it is not a nature. 
 
The collection of five essences fails to be a species because “it is not dissimilar in 
creation from the remaining [five] essences that are in the species” (§ 123). 
Joscelin’s answer is deceptive, since it suggests that the genetic criterion by itself 
will suffice to block the creation of this sort of deviant universal.  But, clearly, Joscelin is 
implicitly invoking another rule as well:   

 
 
 
298
A universal is the complete collection of material essences that are exactly 
indifferent in creation.   
 
Any group of material essences or forms can form a collection.  But for a collection to be 
a universal, the collection must not have a part that is dissimilar in creation from the other 
parts of the collection, and the collection must include all items as parts which are not 
dissimilar in creation from one another.  We will call a collection of essences that 
satisfies these two conditions a complete collection.  
At first pass, this new rule appears to be ad hoc.  The Abelardian challenge was 
for the collection theorist to come up with a principled reason why the collection of five 
essences is not a universal, despite the fact that it meets the revised genetic criterion.  The 
appeal to the new rule provides no such reason. 
Joscelin insists that the collection of five essences would not be a nature.  This 
immediately suggests a parallel to Joscelin’s discussion of Socrates’ great nature (§ 22, 
quoted in 5.1.2).  In the case of Socrates, Joscelin ultimately insists that it is the form hat 
determines the boundaries of the nature.  The form explains why there is no problem how 
a part that was not Socrates—e.g. Socrates-less-the-hand—becomes Socrates after 
amputation.  The form also explains why there is only one great nature.  The form 
informs all the material parts that compose Socrates.  It also, as a matter of course, 
informs any subset of these parts.  But this fact does not license one to infer that there are 
many Socrateses.  That would be tantamount to counting the same form many times over.  
There is only one form of Socrates, and hence there is only one Socrates. 
Unfortunately, Joscelin’s strong hylomorphism may resolve the Problem of the 
Many Socrateses and its cousins, but it does not help to provide a principled justification 

 
 
 
299
for the new rule of completeness, because universals do not have forms.  But perhaps 
universals do not need strongly persisting forms.  In the case of artifacts, the uniqueness 
of creation and the persisting functionality of the remaining mereological sum seemed to 
suffice to guarantee persistence (5.1.2).  Let us furthermore, examine this notion of a 
function.  Often collections of individuals are defined by a specific task or role—e.g. an 
orchestra, a committee, and board of trustees.  These entities are even thought to persist 
even as specific members rotate in and out.  Now consider a family.  While the function 
of a family is perhaps not as obvious as that of an orchestra, there is still a striking 
similarity.  Both are defined groups, whose members can change but which retain their 
identity.  We might even go so far as to suggest that the principle of identity for a family 
is similarity of creation, a commonness of genes. 
The metaphor of a family constitutes the best reply that Joscelin can give to the 
second Abelardian challenge.  Universals are those collections which contain all and 
exactly only those individuals who are exactly indifferent in creation.  This rule now 
seems reasonable.  When searching for the extension of a family, one does not stop with 
just the mother and daughters.  One attempts to find all those individuals who are 
genetically related.  Likewise, when one is looking for the extension of a natural kind, 
one is not content to stop with Plato, Socrates, and Xenophon.  One wants to include all 
those individuals who have the same creative origin.  When looking for the extension of 
Humanity, one is looking for all the offspring of the divine Idea of human being.  
Therefore, I submit, Joscelin’s insistence that a universal collection must be complete is 
not ad hoc. 

 
 
 
300
Finally, let us consider Joscelin’s response to the third Abelardian criticism.  
Individuals come into being and pass away, and presumably their metaphysical 
constituents likewise are subject to generation and corruption.  So a universal analyzed as 
a collection of tropes that resemble one another in the appropriate manner is subject to 
the loss of parts.  One can now ask: do universals survive a change in parts, and if they 
do, what explains this persistence?   
Joscelin is aware of this objection.  In fact, he presents it much more clearly and 
succinctly than Abelard does (De gen. et spec. § 112): 
Again it has been said against [us]: if the species is nothing other than that which 
is composed out of many essences, then whenever this [composite] is changed, 
the species is changed.  Yet this [collection] will change every hour.  For instance, 
let us suppose that humanity consists of only ten essences.  When at some 
moment a man is born, some other humanity is now constructed.  The crowd 
consisting of eleven essences is not the same as the [crowd of] ten.  And as I have 
many times,288 every essence of humanity that composed the species a thousand 
years ago is now altogether gone, and new [essences] have arisen which make up 
the humanity that is the species today.  Therefore, unless at each moment the 
meaning of the utterance ‘man’ changes, it cannot be said with truth at both times 
(bis) ‘Socrates is a man’.  Suppose that you said again ‘Socrates is a man’.  If you 
say this of the humanity which you had said it of previously, it is false, for that 
[humanity] no longer exists. 
 
In his reply Joscelin spends a lot of time elucidating the appropriate theory of 
signification to solve the problem.  But for our purposes, the semantic elements of the 
argument are secondary.  In our view the semantic version of the problem presented and 
challenged by Joscelin depends upon the deeper problem of persistence.289   
                                                 
288 It is unclear whether Joscelin is speaking in propria persona, or whether the ‘I’ refers to the unnamed 
author (Abelard?) of this objection.   
289 The argument reproduced by Joscelin assumes that signification is roughly reference.  Joscelin rejects 
this identification and spends a great deal of energy developing an alternative account of signification (§§ 

 
 
 
301
The analogy to the family helps us understand how Joscelin’s genetic criterion 
can solve the puzzle of persistence for universal wholes (De gen. et spec. § 113): 
It is true that the humanity that was a thousand years ago or which was yesterday 
is not that [humanity] which is today.  Nevertheless, it is the same as that—i.e. it 
is not dissimilar in creation.  For it is not the case that what is the same with 
another is the same this.  A man and a donkey are the same in genus, and 
nonetheless this is not that.  Socrates is composed out of more atoms as a man 
than as a boy, but is nonetheless the same.  
 
Joscelin proposes that universal wholes have roughly the same sort of persistence 
conditions that organic individuals possess.  In both cases, the wholes are not defined 
extensionally.  Persistence does not depend upon mereological constancy.  In the case of 
Socrates, this is because of the formal and the genetic criterion.  The universal, however, 
is more akin to the family—it has a looser functional criterion of persistence that is 
dependent upon the extended genetic criterion.  New members of the family are born, 
other members perish.  But the family persists.  Likewise, new members of a natural kind 
are born, others perish.  But according to Joscelin the universal, which is the sum of all 
individuals exactly indifferent in creation currently present, persists even as its 
membership changes. 
The general outline of Joscelin’s collection theory is now complete.  Joscelin’s 
response to the three Abelardian challenges is defensible.  Yet a curious fact remains: for 
all their real and apparent differences, what is really striking is how similar Abelard and 
Joscelin are.  Consider this interpretation by a leading scholar of Abelard (King 2004, 
82): 
                                                                                                                                                 
92-102, and 113).  Joscelin’s views about the signification of universal terms are interesting and worthy of 
study, but this project lies outside the scope of our project.   

 
 
 
302
By “naturally similar” Abelard means that the similarity between Socrates and 
Plato is not conventional, but rather a fact about the world that follows from each 
being human, which is itself a function of their biological history.  In short, 
Abelard takes a natural kind to be a well-defined collection of things that have the 
same features, broadly speaking, that make them what they are.  …On this 
reading, it is clear that natural kinds have no special status; they are no more than 
discrete integral wholes whose principle of membership is similarity, merely 
reflecting the fact that the world is divided into discrete similarity-classes of 
objects. 
 
If Peter King is right, the only crucial difference between Joscelin and Abelard, is that 
Joscelin takes the added step to insist that these similarity-classes are res, that universals 
are something over and above the individuals that compose them.290  I have already 
proposed one reason why Joscelin may have taken this extra step at the beginning of 
section 5.2.1; there may be others.291  But as a provocative afterthought: perhaps Cousin 
was not so crazy for mistakenly attributing the treatise On Genera and Species to 
Abelard.  I still think that the evidence en masse counts against such an attribution.  But 
the similarities suggest that Abelard and Joscelin were both tapping a common source of 
ideas. 
 
5.3: Conclusion to chapter 5 
We started with the observation that Abelard’s treatment of persistence with 
respect to mereological change is in tension with many of our commonsense notions 
about mundane objects.  Our evidence shows that a number of twelfth-century 
                                                 
290 I will not attempt to assess the merits of Joscelin’s theory as a solution to the problem of universals.  But 
I think that of the two, Abelard’s solution is the more elegant and successful solution.  
291 Another possible reason is Joscelin’s acceptance of the common view that predication is inherence (De 
gen. et spec. § 93). 

 
 
 
303
contemporaries of Abelard were also uneasy about some of the ramifications of Abelard’s 
and his followers’ theory of persistence.  Twelfth-century Moderates attempt to rescue 
commonsense objects by offering an alternative form-centered approach to persistence.  I 
have identified Joscelin as a philosopher whose work stands out as a sophisticated 
version of the Moderate position.  Joscelin also defends a version of the collection theory 
of universals, a theory which many presumed was definitively refuted by Abelard.  In 5.2, 
I hope I have shown that Abelard’s criticisms are not definitive.  In fact, I have suggested 
that Joscelin’s collection theory contains a number of elements that are agreeable to 
Abelard.   
I have claimed that Joscelin’s Moderate metaphysics of mereology and 
persistence is a defensible alternative to Abelard’s, and that Joscelin’s theory has the 
virtue of preserving commonsense.  However, I hesitate to make the stronger claim that 
Joscelin’s theory trumps that of Abelard.  My reasons for refraining will be taken up in 
more detail in the next chapter, but these reasons boil down to this worry: Joscelin can 
preserve common sense only at a price.  Namely, Joscelin and Moderates of his ilk are 
committed to the existence of robustly real forms.  While these forms do a remarkable 
amount of work preserving the persistence of mundane objects, many philosophers find 
them suspicious.  I have shown in chapter 4 that Abelard is often suspicious of real forms, 
and he attempts to reduce many of them away.  In order to declare an outright victor, we 
need to decide whether we can live without hypostasized forms. 

 
 
 
304
CHAPTER 6 
 
 
CONCLUSION 
 
 
 
 
No one is yet in a position to write the full history of early medieval mereology.  
But I hope that the reader is now convinced that such a project would be fruitful.  Two of 
the brightest minds in the twelfth century were preoccupied with puzzles central to 
mereology and the related metaphysical issues concerning the identity and survival of 
material objects.  In my view, their work in mereology and the metaphysics of identity 
and persistence is first rate.  The positions that they carve out are still among the viable 
options considered and embraced by contemporary metaphysicians. 
In chapter 2 I argued that the theory of part and whole is not solely an exercise in 
formal logic.  The logic of parts and wholes is dependent upon a number of extra-logical 
considerations.  In particular, before one develops a formal system of parts and whole, I 
think one must first complete four basic projects.  First, one must decide which items in 
one’s ontology may be parts.  Second, one must decide when some things become one 
whole.  Third, one must determine what relations of dependence, if any, obtain between a 
whole and its parts.  In particular, one must determine whether any relations of 

 
 
 
305
ontological dependence obtain between the part and whole.  Finally, based upon what 
relations of ontological dependence obtain, one must develop a theory of synchronic and 
diachronic identity for wholes.   
With these parameters in place, I then turned my attention to Boethius.  I took this 
detour because I have stressed that the contributions of Abelard and Pseudo-Joscelin 
cannot be adequately assessed until we come to terms with the mereological doctrines of 
their intellectual predecessor.  Boethius is the most influential transmitter and interpreter 
of ancient Greek philosophical concepts to the medieval West, and hence Boethius had a 
profound influence upon the development of early medieval mereology.  I think two 
features of Boethius’ mereology, in particular, must be emphasized.  First, Boethius fails 
to stress the importance of the classical Aristotelian concept of form, and accordingly he 
passes over the mereologically pregnant notion of mutilation (3.3.4).  Second, Boethius 
presents and repeatedly highlights a rule commonly presented in ancient textbooks which 
says that if a part is removed, the whole is removed as well (3.2.2, and 3.3.4).  It is 
precisely for these reasons that Abelard and Pseudo-Joscelin emphasize the role that the 
material parts of things play in the identity and persistence conditions of these things.  
Boethius’ emphasis of the Greek scholastic rule also encourages the development of a 
brand of mereological essentialism that develops in the twelfth century, and which is 
embraced to some degree by Abelard.   
As I have shown, Abelard takes Boethius’ scholastic rule to heart and proposes 
that the loss of any part entails the annihilation of that very whole (4.3.1).  For this reason 
Abelard flirts with a type of mereological essentialism.  Yet Abelard also insists that 

 
 
 
306
human beings survive a variety of mereological changes.  D. P. Henry takes these 
commitments as evidence that Abelard has no consistent, well-formulated theory of 
material objects.  But I have argued that this interpretation is mistaken.  It is true that 
Abelard thinks the material essences of things suffer annihilation upon the gain or loss of 
even one part.  He even holds that many structured wholes, such as houses and brooms, 
are dependent upon their parts in this strict sense, because the forms of these sorts of 
object weakly supervene upon the arrangements of the material parts.  But following a 
hint from Abelard’s followers, the Nominales, we can readily see that persons have a 
different, looser criterion for persistence.  The material essence of a person is 
mereologically constant, and therefore the material essence of a person cannot survive 
mereological change.  The sum of bodily parts plus a soul is, accordingly, subject to the 
rule of mereological constancy.  From the strict metaphysician’s point of view, this sum 
does not increase or decrease.  But the person needs to retain only one part, her soul, in 
order to persist. 
I noted with some disappointment that Abelard is silent about objects which are 
neither artifacts nor persons, such as stones, flowers, and dogs.  Moreover, what Abelard 
does say suggests that all non-human primary substances are mereologically constant.  
He claims that animal and plant souls are material, and so it would seem that these non-
human souls cannot be principles of persistence.  I went on to argue that there is evidence 
that Abelard does not think animals and plants suffer the same tenuous existence as 
artifacts.  Abelard asserts that there is a strict divide between artifacts, which are cobbled 
together by humans, and substances, which are created by God.  Presumably, then, there 

 
 
 
307
is also a corresponding difference in the persistence conditions of artifacts and 
substances.  I offered the tentative suggestion that substances differ from artifacts in 
virtue of the type of form that informs them.  In particular, there is some evidence—but 
unfortunately not definitive evidence—that the substantial differentiae are not dependent 
upon the material parts, that they are somehow more real.  I argued that if this is indeed 
Abelard’s view, then he has the resources to draw the sort of definitive distinction 
between artifacts and substances that he desires.  On the one hand, artifacts have forms 
which are strongly dependent upon the arrangement of the material parts.  The forms of 
artifacts cannot survive mereological change.  Hence, artifacts are mereologically 
constant.  On the other hand, if the substantial differentiae are real and not supervenient, 
then these forms can act as the principle of persistence for substances.  So long as the 
differentiae survive, the substance can survive mereological changes. 
If I am right, Abelard’s theory of persistence for artifacts is similar to the theory 
of Roderick Chisholm, and Abelard’s theory of substantial persistence resembles the 
Stoic theory that is attributed to Chrysippus.292  Let me briefly consider in turn each 
resemblance. 
Chisholm holds that the existence of a material particular depends upon the 
existence of its parts: “For every x and y if x is ever part of y, then y is necessarily such 
                                                 
292 The comparison of Abelard’s metaphysics of identity and persistence to the Stoics is made in passing by 
Calvin Normore (1992, 89).  In a recent essay Normore has made the bold claim that “Abelard is as close to 
Stoicism as a Christian could be”, and that Abelard use of the Stoics is not an “independent rediscovery of 
Stoic ideas but a self-conscious taking up of them” (2004, 132).  Unfortunately, Normore then restricts the 
scope of his essay to Abelard’s application of Stoic principles to ethics.  To my knowledge, no one has 
explicitly compared Abelard to Chisholm. 

 
 
 
308
that x is part of y at any time that y exists.” (1976, 149)293  And like Abelard, Chisholm 
rejects one popular avenue in contemporary discussions of persistence: temporal parts 
(1976, 139-44).294  Objects such as chairs, houses and statues appear to suffer regular 
losses of parts due to everyday use, and they appear to survive this wear-and-tear.  But 
Chisholm insists that appearances are deceiving.  Material things are all “entia per alia”, 
or “entia successiva”.  They are “logical constructions” out of successive mereological 
sums, each of which are composed out of individuals that he identifies as the “entia per 
se” (1976, 97).295  Abelard has something similar in mind.  Strictly speaking this house, 
which just is this mereological sum of stones and wood arranged as a house, does not 
survive the loss or gain of a part.  Nonetheless, so long as there is mereological continuity 
between the first sum and the second sum, and both sums are houses, we are licensed to 
say that a house survives wear-and-tear (4.3.1). 
                                                 
293 Cf. Chisholm (1989, 66).  Van Cleve also holds that something like the Principle of Mereological 
Constancy applies to sums, artifacts and non-living material objects.  He makes exceptions for organisms 
and persons (1986, 147 ff.). 
294 In his swan-song, A Realistic Theory of Categories (1996), Chisholm appears at first pass to recant and 
admit that material objects can have temporal parts.  But a more careful reading of his text reveals that 
there has been no major shift in his position.  Entia successiva, he says, “may have individual things as 
temporal parts” (93).  But all Chisholm means by this is that what we take loosely and popularly to be, for 
example, a broom is really a series of individuals stretched out in time.  The broom is not one individual 
composed out of temporal parts, as the perdurantist would have us describe this scenario.  If there is still 
any doubt, one need only read on to find that Chisholm reiterates the claim that a person’s body only exists 
in the loose and popular sense (100).  
295 Chisholm also insists that persons are entia per se, and hence not subject to mereological essentialism.  
Interestingly, Chisholm’s arguments for the substantiality of persons are not mereological; they rely on the 
unity of subjective experience (1976, 140 ff.). 

 
 
 
309
Abelard might have influenced Chisholm; he certainly anticipates Chisholm.296  
When we turn to substantial persistence Abelard is anticipated by the Stoics.  It seems 
that Chrysippus developed his analysis of persistence in response to the “Growing 
Argument” (auxanomenos logos), which David Sedley suspects was employed by the 
Academic skeptics in their disputations with the Stoic school (1982, 256).  A quick 
inspection of the Hellenistic Growing Argument reveals how similar it is to Abelard’s 
argument against increase and decrease.  As with Abelard’s version, the argument 
attempts to establish that nothing is augmented or diminished, since the addition or 
subtraction of even one particle of matter entails that the initial collection of particles is 
no longer identical with the new collection.  Chrysippus admits that when considered at 
the level of material essences, or substrates, collections of material particles are 
mereologically constant.297  But Chrysippus adds another level of description, which is 
echoed in Abelard’s analysis of persistence.298  The Stoics distinguish between the 
“substrate” (to hupokeimenon) and the “qualified thing” (to poion).299  The qualified 
                                                 
296 I will not press the point too hard, but in my view, Abelard not only anticipates Chisholm, his analysis 
of change and persistence is superior to Chisholm’s.  Abelard properly emphasizes the role that the 
arrangement of the parts plays in the phenomena of successive objects, whereas Chisholm does not.  
Because Chisholm does not accord due attention to the nature of this arrangement, it is not clear how he 
can distinguish between a broom and the mereological sum of {bristles + handle}.  He will also have 
trouble explaining what happens when the bristles and handle suffer lose and then regain a broom structure.  
Assume that not one bristle or atom is lost during these rearrangements.  Did this very broom go out of 
existence and then come back into existence?  In other words, can objects have sporadic existence?  On this 
puzzle, and others that arise from Chisholm’s mereological commitments, consult Cartwright’s treatment of 
scattered objects (1975).

thing is divided in turn into generally qualified things, and “the uniquely qualified things” 
(ta idiôs poia).300  Persons, and other structured entities are uniquely qualified things.  
According to the Stoics, that which is uniquely qualified can endure changes in 
substrate,301 just as Abelard allows for a looser sense in which the retention of a state 
(status) will underwrite a looser form of persistence for artifacts and non-human 
substances (4.3.2-4). 
Based upon these brief comparisons, Abelard is in good company.  His central 
ideas echo the philosophy that dominated the Hellenistic and Roman eras, and many of 
them still have currency among contemporary metaphysicians.  Yet, in particular with 
regard to the Stoics, it would be a mistake to think that Abelard is a copy-cat.  The lines 
of transmission between Stoic views and the twelfth century are obscure.  There is very 
little direct transmission.  As Gerard Verbeke notes, at no time was there an “invasion of 
Stoicism” into the Middle Ages.  There was no massive introduction of Stoic writings 
into the Middle Ages (1983, 1).302  Rather, the assimilation of Stoic ideas was indirect, 
and mediated through the Greek and Latin Church Fathers (idem. 5).  Consequently, even 
                                                 
300 Dexippus In Cat. 23.25-24.4 (SVF II.374).  The relationship between ta poia and ta idiôs poia is 
complex, and not without its interpretive and philosophical problems.  For an analysis of the relation 
between qualified and uniquely qualified things, consult Irwin’s study of the Stoics on individuals (1996, 
466-75), and also Rist (1969, 159-67). 
301 See Simplicius In de Anima 217.36-218.2; and Arius Didymus (SVF II.395); cf. Simplicius In Cat. 
140.24-30. 
302 Sten Ebbesen has recently claimed that Stoicism was both everywhere and nowhere in the Late Middle 
ages (2004, 108).  Stoicism is everywhere because a significant number of Stoic ideas can be detected in 
scholastic thought.  But Stoicism is at the same time nowhere, for like us the scholastics did not possess any 
texts of the major Stoic thinkers, nor did they possess anything like von Arnim’s landmark collection of 
fragments (SVF).  Concerning mereology, Ebbesen notes that there is some evidence that at least the later 
medieval thinkers were aware of the puzzle of Dion and Theon (2004, 122 and note 59).  

 
 
 
311
if it is not entirely without precedent, Abelard’s mereology is a remarkable advance in the 
history of the subject.  Moreover, his utilization of the principle of overlap to develop a 
subtle analysis of sameness in being and numerical sameness has no detectable precedent 
in the history of philosophy.  It is a unique accomplishment.   
Abelard’s theory is perhaps less satisfying when it addresses the problem of 
persistence.  Such everyday objects as brooms and houses cease to be objects that endure 
through time and seemingly trivial mereological change.  Moreover, the endurance of 
non-human substances is not guaranteed, since my reconstructed solution to substantial 
persistence rests heavily upon texts which are not definitively from Abelard’s own hand 
(4.1.2). 
It seems that some of Abelard’s students, the so-called Nominales, took the more 
extreme position with respect to the endurance of substances (4.3.4).  Some of the reports 
of their views suggest that both Socrates’ essentia and Socrates’ substance are 
mereologically constant, whereas Socrates the person is not mereologically constant.  
Furthermore, our evidence concerning the Nominales suggests that they made no 
distinction between the forms of artifacts and the forms belonging to substances.  In 
short, the Nominales appear to be even more anti-realist than their teacher.  We might 
even say that, because they reject the notion that substantial differentia are real, the 
Nominales have taken Abelard’s mereological views to their logical conclusion.   
The Abelardian or Nominalist world-view is austere, and revisionist.  It requires 
us to rethink and to reject some of our deeply held intuitions about the nature and 
persistence of ordinary objects.  Intuitions may be jettisoned, and if the Nominales are 

 
 
 
312
right, many of them should be.  But sometimes intuitions can be indications that our 
metaphysics has taken the wrong tack.  It appears that a number of twelfth-century 
philosophers felt precisely this way.  In this period, we can detect a strong tendency 
toward what I called the Moderate position on mereological change and persistence.  In 
this study I focused upon Pseudo-Joscelin’s Moderate position, and argued that it is a 
viable alternative to Abelard’s theory of persistence.  Pseudo-Joscelin rejects the claim 
that persistence is determined by mereological constancy.  In place of this austere 
principle, Pseudo-Joscelin suggests that a combination of mereological continuity and the 
persistence of form and function can secure the persistence of objects.  He thinks that 
these principles can secure persistence of not only humans and primary substance, but 
also artifacts, and even universals.  Pseudo-Joscelin rejects Abelard’s thesis that the 
removal of any part entails the destruction of the whole, even in the case of artifacts and 
universals.  The annihilation of a whole follows only from the removal of parts principal 
in essence, since the removal of a part principal in essence leads to the elimination of the 
object’s form and function.  Thus, a chip in the doorframe does not annihilate this house, 
whereas removing a keystone in the foundation, or perhaps blowing a large hole in the 
roof, will do just that.  
While Pseudo-Joscelin’s account agrees with commonsense, it does not come for 
free.  Pseudo-Joscelin’s account of persistence depends upon some controversial 
philosophical principles.  Specifically, Pseudo-Joscelin requires that forms, and the 
functions encoded in them, play a primary role in identity and persistence (5.1.2).  If 
forms and their functions are to play their proper roles in Pseudo-Joscelin’s metaphysics, 

 
 
 
313
these forms must be ontologically independent to a greater degree than Abelard is (at 
least at times) willing to endorse.  This is most apparent in the case of artifacts, where 
Abelard insists that forms merely supervene upon the arrangement of the parts.  The form 
of a house or a broom is not real.  In contrast, Pseudo-Joscelin must assert that the form 
of the broom is something real, and that it is relatively independent of the matter of the 
broom. 
Ultimately, then, in order to declare a victor of the struggle between Abelard and 
Pseudo-Joscelin, we must first decide whether we prefer our forms to be of the 
supervening variety or the robust variety.  Those suspicious of independently existing 
forms will prefer the austere metaphysics initiated by Abelard and carried to its logical 
conclusion by the Nominales.  Those who are comfortable with independently existing 
forms can choose Pseudo-Joscelin’s more Moderate program. 
In this study I have often compared and contrasted the metaphysics of our twelfth-
century philosophers to what we might call a “standard” understanding of Aristotelian 
metaphysics.  One of my claims is that while Boethius is well versed in this standard 
Aristotelianism, for a variety of reasons he often fails to relate this system in its full 
complexity to later medieval readers.  But if I am right, Pseudo-Joscelin’s Moderate 
metaphysics bears a degree of similarity to standard Aristotelianism.  In both systems, 
form plays a dominant role in determining the individuality, identity, and survival of a 
composite thing.  However, Pseudo-Joscelin applies his mereological principles in ways 
Aristotle and his neoplatonic followers do not.  Most notably, Pseudo-Joscelin vigorously 
defends the thesis that a universal is an integral whole composed of particulars.   

 
 
 
314
Abelard thinks collection theories were indefensible, since if universals were 
integral collections, they would be subject to the rule of mereological constancy.  But this 
would undermine the value of universals as objects for the understanding and semantic 
reference.  Pseudo-Joscelin defends the theory by expanding upon his theory of 
persistence for substances and artifacts.  Universals also have something akin to a 
structure, which guarantees their persistence through change in membership.  Ultimately, 
I think that Pseudo-Joscelin’s theory boils down to a version of resemblance nominalism, 
with all of that general theory’s advantages and liabilities.  I leave the reader to decide 
whether the theory succeeds as an answer to the problem of universals.  But again I ask 
that the reader consider how similar the metaphysical assumptions of Pseudo-Joscelin 
and Abelard ultimately are, for Abelard also flirts with resemblance nominalism.   
These observations regarding the similarities and dissimilarities between Pseudo-
Joscelin’s Moderate metaphysics and a standard Aristotelianism suggest another reason 
why the intellectual innovations of the twelfth century are worthy of study, and why a 
complete history of twelfth-century philosophy is desirable. 
Boethius, for reasons of expediency, or perhaps out of a genuine lack of 
carefulness, bequeathes a mereological system that is bled of powerful Aristotelian tools, 
to the early middle ages.  These omissions and simplifications clearly shape the way that 
Abelard and Pseudo-Joscelin proceed to frame and resolve mereological puzzles.  For 
these reasons, it is tempting to conclude that Boethius hinders intellectual progress by 
emphasizing the textbook rule of parts and wholes, while obscuring the metaphysical 
potency of forms.  But Boethius’ seemingly negative influence is in reality an impetus for 

 
 
 
315
some remarkably innovative philosophical reflection.  For example, deprived of full 
access to classical Aristotelian concepts, Pseudo-Joscelin is nevertheless able to 
independently motivate the need for a form-based solution to puzzles concerning 
mereological change.  Given the dominance of Aristotle’s hylomorphism in the later 
medieval periods, it is surely possible that had Abelard been acquainted with Aristotle’s 
fully fleshed-out metaphysics, he would not have developed his austere, and at times 
reductivist analysis of material objects.  In short, because they were liberated from the 
authoritative constraints of a full-fledged Aristotelian system both Abelard and Pseudo-
Joscelin were free to develop original, sophisticated, and I think, defensible theories 
about the relations of a thing to its parts.
