TRENDS IN LOGIC
Studia Logica Library
Volume 37
Trends in Logicis a book series covering essentially the same area as the journal
Studia Logica—that is, contemporary formal logic and its applications and rela-
tions to other disciplines. These include artiﬁcial intelligence, informatics, cog-
nitive science, philosophy of science, and the philosophy of language. However,
this list is not exhaustive, moreover, the range of applications, comparisons and
sources of inspiration is open and evolves over time.

To my teachers

Preface
The Lvov-Warsaw School of Logic and Analytic Philosophy was one of the most
important schools of philosophical thought in twentieth century. In early 1910s its
members already discussed the validity of the principles of excluded middle
and contradiction. Among ideas developed in this school, one might count
Łukasiewicz’s view that one can believe a contradiction and that certain sentences
can be neither true nor false. This led to the construction of his three-valued logic.
Another example is Ajdukiewicz’s conventionalism about meaning and his formal
work on deﬁnitions (it seems that it was Ajdukiewicz and Łukasiewicz who ﬁrst
focused on the consistency, translatability, and non-creativity conditions on deﬁ-
nitions, at least on the Polish ground). Other examples include Jas´kowski’s
approach to natural deduction and his work on discussive logics, Lindenbaum’s
lemma on maximally consistent sets of formulas, Presburger’s work on arithmetic,
Kotarbin´ski’s semantical reism, and Tarski’s work on formal semantics and truth.
One
of
the
representatives
of
this
school
was
Stanisław
Les´niewski
(1886–1939) (Alfred Tarski, whose importance in twentieth century logic it is hard
to overestimate, was his only Ph.D. student). Les´niewski developed his system of
foundations of mathematics as an alternative to the system of Principia Math-
ematica. He constructed three systems: Protothetic, which is his version of a
generalized propositional calculus, his own (higher-order) logic of predication
called Ontology, and a theory of parthood called Mereology.
Les´niewski’s work is interesting for a few reasons.
• If one is interested in history of logic in general, it is hard to deny that Les´niewski
was one of the key ﬁgures in one of the most important schools of logic in twentieth
century. He devoted his research to developing an alternative to the system of
Principia Mathematica and this attempt is worth studying in his own right.
• If one is interested in the development of Tarski’s thought it might be useful to
learn what his Ph.D. supervisor’s views were and how Les´niewski’s work and
Tarski’s ideas are (or are not) related.
• Philosophical discussions in which Les´niewski participated pertained to issues
which are discussed quite lively even today. His approach to semantical and
set-theoretic paradoxes and his views on the validity of the principle of excluded
middle and of the principle of contradiction are philosophically interesting.
vii

• Les´niewski was a nominalist and his systems were a nominalistic attempt to
provide a system of foundations of mathematics. It is a major attempt of this sort
and as such it is worth an examination.
• His metalogic is quite speciﬁc. Nominalist as he was, he wanted to develop a
purely inscriptional syntactic description of his systems in a way that did not make
any reference to expression types. It is interesting to see how he proceeded.
• His systems have some interesting properties. For instance, in all of them deﬁni-
tions can be creative (and this is not considered to be a problem). The generality of
Prothetic admits interesting extensions (intuitionistic (see López-Escobar and
Miraglia 2002) or modal (see the works of Suszko and in general, see Sect. 3.7 for
references). The language of Ontology (which, in a way, can be viewed as one of
the ﬁrst free formal logics) is, arguably, more suitable for capturing certain aspects
of predication and abstract noun phrases as they work in natural language.
This book is devoted to a presentation of Les´niewski’s achievements and their
critical evaluation. I discuss his philosophical views, describe his systems, and
evaluate the role they can play in the foundations of mathematics. It was my purpose
to focus on primary sources and present Les´niewski’s own views and results rather
than those present in secondary literature. For this reason, later developments are not
treated in detail but rather either mentioned in passing, or described in sections
devoted to secondary literature included in some chapters. The intended audience of
this book includes philosophy majors, graduate students, and professional philos-
ophers interested in logic, mathematics, and their philosophy and history.
Parts of this book started as my Ph.D. dissertation written under the supervision
of Richard Zach and defended in 2008 at the University of Calgary. Other parts
report on research which went beyond the dissertation (in particular, Chap. 6 was
written together with Severi K. Hämäri). Ultimately, in 2011 my wife took me to
India, where she pursued her research in Indian philosophy and forced me to use
those few months to write the whole book anew.

Preface

Acknowledgments
This book started as a Ph.D. thesis written under supervision of Richard Zach at
the University of Calgary and I owe him gratitude for his time, effort, and patience.
I am also grateful for all the comments on my dissertation which I received from
Nicole Wyatt, Jack MacIntosh, and John Kearns.
I would also like to thank my other teachers. Words cannot express my grati-
tude to my ﬁrst philosophy teachers, Martyna, and Robert Koszkało, from whom I
stole (well, borrowed and never returned) my ﬁrst book on Les´niewski’s systems
and without whose motivation I would probably end up being a helicopter pilot
(and we all know how unexciting and underpaid that job would be). I owe grat-
itude to my M.A. supervisor, Jarosław Mrozek, who allowed me to teach my ﬁrst
seminar on Les´niewski before I graduated and to my M.A. referee, Andrzej
Włodzimierz Mostowski.
As for Chap. 6, many thanks for their comments to John MacFarlane, Nuel
Belnap, Wilfrid Hodges, Paolo Mancosu, Øystein Linnebo, and Jan von Plato.
Work on this part was supported by the Special Research Fund of Ghent University
through project [BOF07/GOA/019].
Later parts were discussed at various places where I was giving talks: Ghent,
Riga, Edinburgh, Szklarska Pore˛ba, Hejnice, Geneva, Frankfurt, Dublin, St.
Andrews, Auckland, and Oxford, among others. I am grateful to all the audience
members for their feedback. The approach to higher-order quantiﬁcation discussed
in the last chapter was also partially shaped in discussion with Øystein Linnebo,
who was my host at Bristol during my British Academy Visiting Fellowship,
Hannes Leitgeb and Leon Horsten—other Bristol Philosophy Department mem-
bers at the time of my stay in Bristol—and Stewart Shapiro, whom I ran into and
tended to disagree with on various occasions.
I am grateful to my students, Paweł Pawłowski and Paweł Siniło, who proof-
read major parts of this text and helped me to avoid at least some of the mistakes.
I was also able to discuss a late draft of this book with Peter Simons during my
stay in Dublin as a Long Room Hub Visiting Fellow, so I would also like to thank
the Long Room Hub and Peter Simons for their support.
ix

I am deeply thankful to my parents, Halina, and Andrzej Urbaniak—the list of
things I am grateful for would probably be longer than the book itself. Finally,
I am grateful to my wife, Agnieszka Rostalska, for her patience in general, for
causing my voluntary exile in India and for turning it into a writing spree.

Chapter 1
Introduction
Abstract I provide motivations for the research, describe the structure of the book,
give a short biography of Le´sniewski and provide details of primary sources.
1.1 A Few Words of Motivation
Of course, other surveys of Le´sniewski’s work exist. However, to the best of my
knowledge, their scope and interests differ from mine. Most of the discussions present
in the literature focus just on selected aspects of Le´sniewski’s work. For instance,
Słupecki (1953, 1955), Iwanu´s (1973), Rickey (1976) and Lejewski (1958) focus
on one of the logical systems only. Luschei (1962) and Betti (2005) cover not only
the content of what Le´sniewski actually published, but also almost indistinguishably
speak of what he is known (from other sources) by the authors to have said or
believed. Wole´nski (1985), Rickey (1976) and Betti (2005) are too brief to provide
a complete introduction. When the above authors discuss Le´sniewski’s views, they
focus on presenting them rather uncritically, whereas works that criticize Le´sniewski
(such as Grzegorczyk 1955) have been justly accused of misrepresenting the systems.
So, my intention is to provide a survey that covers many aspects of what Le´sniewski
published, makes a clear istinction between what views can be assigned to him based
on textual evidence and what he is reported or believed to have claimed, and, when
is philosophical views are discussed, assesses them critically.
There are a few books on certain aspects of Le´sniewski’s thought written in
French: Miéville (1984, 2001, 2004, 2009), Miéville and Vernant (1995), Gessler
(2005, 2007), Peeters (2005). Their focus, however, is more historical than critical
(see e.g. a review by Quinon (2011)), while my interests are more analytical.
Probably the only published book-long treatment of similar scope written in
English is Luschei’s book, titled The Logical Systems of Le´sniewski (1962). In many
respects it is admirable. Unfortunately, it has also been criticized on a few points.

Introduction
First, the text has been found to be too polemical towards other logicians Cohen
(1965).1 It also does not contain an accessible account of how proofs in Le´sniewski’s
systems work Thomas (1967), Kearns (1973) points out that not too many results
are clearly stated.2 Dawson (1965) emphasizes that the author gets involved in a
somewhat biased philosophical commentary about the system and historical remarks
rather than presenting Le´sniewski’s views critically.3 I do not want to suggest that I
managed to avoid any criticism of the above sort. Rather, I would be glad if it turned
out that at least to some degree my work constitutes even a slight improvement on
these points.
As I mentioned in the preface, the intended audience of this book includes phi-
losophy majors, graduate students and professional philosophers interested in logic,
mathematics and their philosophy and history. This puts the author in a slightly difﬁ-
cult position. On the one hand, the nature of the topic may make the book sometimes
challenging for a philosophically-minded reader. On the other hand, due to accessi-
bility considerations, mathematically-minded readers mind ﬁnd the book slow-paced
and sometimes not as technically precise as they think it should be.
As a philosopher, I am mostly interested in those technical issues which I think
are philosophically relevant. Given that the intended audience includes philosophers,
I decided to abandon some details of certain technically interesting dimensions of
Le´sniewski’s work (like a step-by-step explication of his Terminological Explana-
tions, detailed proofs of some theorems, or the technicalities related to Le´sniewski’s
approach to formal systems as developing in time). This, to some extent, is a matter
of taste—one person’s sloppy is another person’s saving 15minutes of my life.
A related worry is that readers with purely mathematical background might con-
sider philosophical aspects of this work to be of questionable relevance and validity.
But this seems to be the attitude they would have towards most of philosophical
1 “In his zeal to demonstrate the outstanding merit of Le´sniewski’s contributions to logic…Luschei
sometimes devotes a disproportionate amount of space to denigrating the work of other logicians.”
2 “The book is expository. It does not contain proofs, and not many results are stated precisely. The
author’s style makes reading difﬁcult; many passages give the impression of being literal transla-
tions from some language unlike English. The book is also marred by being unduly polemical. It
would have been relatively simple to present Le´sniewski’s views and describe his practices, and
then show how these differ from those of other logicians. Instead Luschei champions Le´sniewski’s
views, and mentions many other logicians only to show how far short they fall of a Le´sniewskian
ideal…Luschei’s explanations are less helpful, than they might be, for he uses a cumbersome, unfa-
miliar terminology, which sometimes makes his explanation as much trouble to work through as the
T.E [Le´sniewski’s Terminological Explanations]. Luschei also fails to provide helpful comparisons
with more familiar systems.”
3 “From its title, one might be prepared to ﬁnd in this book either a presentation and development
of the systems in question, or a discussion and commentary about the systems (or both of these). In
fact, Professor Luschei concerns himself almost entirely with the latter task, and indeed no proofs
of theorems appear in the text at all, although some examples of ‘Le´sniewski’s technique of “natural
deduction” ’ are given in a note. Thus the book is primarily directed at readers who wish to learn
something of the historical and philosophical background and foundations of Lesniewski’s systems
of logic, rather than to those who wish to become familiar with speciﬁc theses of the logic or to
acquire facility with the formal techniques involved.”

texts and I can hardly do anything about it. Just as some mathematicians would
ﬁnd philosophical discussion irrelevant and uninteresting, some philosophers would
take highly abstract and philosophically uninterpreted mathematical results to be
uninteresting and irrelevant. Having said this, I hope philosophically-minded math-
ematicians will also be able to ﬁnd something interesting in this work.
1.2 The Structure of This Book
This chapter continues with a brief biography, a survey of primary sources, and
acknowledgments. In Chap.2, I discuss Le´sniewski’s philosophical views from the
early period. I start with an account of Le´sniewski’s understanding of linguistic
conventions (Sect.2.2). Le´sniewski’s linguistic conventions may be thought of as
various additional restrictions put on natural language. Those include deﬁnitions,
which determine how he uses some terms, some general conditions on what truth
conditions of various statements are, and some other assumptions about the lan-
guage of the discourse which are hard to classify. I also provide some basic conven-
tions that he accepted and used in the years 1911–1914. Next, after a brief detour
through Le´sniewski’s views on proper names, I show how he applied those con-
ventions to various problems. That is, I discuss what conclusions those conventions
helped him to draw about existential propositions (Sect.2.4), the principle of con-
tradiction (Sect.2.5), the principle of excluded middle (Sect.2.6), the eternity of
truth (Sect.2.7), and how he attempted to solve a few paradoxes (Sect.2.8): Nelson–
Grelling’s, Meinong’s, Epimenides’ (the Liar), and Russell’s. Finally I say a few
words about his rejection of abstract objects (Sect.2.9).
Chapter3 is devoted to Le´sniewski’s generalized system of propositional calculus
(called Protothetic). In Sect.3.1, I describe the historical context in which it was
constructed. In Sect.3.2, I discuss the notion of semantic categories which is cru-
cial for the construction of Le´sniewski’s systems. Section3.3 deals with Le´sniewski’s
original “wheel-and-spoke” notation. Section3.4 describes Le´sniewski’s motivations
for his formulation of Protothetic (especially his criticism of Principia Mathemat-
ica). Protothetic originated as the result of gradual axiomatic generalization of the
propositional calculus. The ﬁrst propositional system (S) given by Le´sniewski is a
purely equivalential propositional calculus without quantiﬁers. The second system
(S1) admitted quantiﬁers binding propositional quantiﬁers and also variables repre-
senting propositional connectives. Extending S1 with a certain rule (rule η) results
in a stronger system S2. However, η was quite complicated, so it was replaced by
another, simpler rule (called the rule of extensionality, η⋆). The result of this replace-
ment is called S3. A conditional reformulation of S3 was called S4 and a slight
modiﬁcation of S3 in which deﬁnitions were of a different form was called S5. All
those axiomatizations are presented in Sect.3.5. Section 3.7 is an annotated guide to
the secondary literature of the subject.
Chapter4 is concerned with Le´sniewski’s Ontology. Section4.1 introduces the
basic intuitions behind the system and indicates in what respects the system differs
from the classical logic. In Sect.4.2 the language of Ontology is described in more

Introduction
detail, and Sect.4.3 presents the 1920 axiomatization of Ontology. Some examples
of deﬁnitions of Ontology that highlight the ﬂexibility of the language in question are
given in Sect.4.4. A good example of a reasoning led in Ontology is Le´sniewski’s
argument against universals. A certain formulation of this argument is discussed
in Sect.4.5. I also discuss the relation between Ontology and Russell’s description
theory in Sect.4.6 and Le´sniewski’s attempt to employ Ontology to deal with a
certain paradox (having to do with four-dimensional objects) in Sect.4.7. Secondary
literature pertaining to Ontology is discussed in Sect.4.9.
Le´sniewski’s Mereology is discussed in Chap.5. In Sect.5.1, I focus on
Le´sniewski’s motivations for mereology. Section5.2 describes and compares the
axiomatizations of Mereology from years 1916, 1918, 1920 and 1921. Section5.3
introduces those theorems of Mereology which initially were intended to support
the claim that Mereology can be a sensible replacement for set theory and also those
theorems which indicate to what extent Mereology turns out to be different from the
standard set theory. In the same section I also critically assess the potential role of
Mereology in the foundations of mathematics. Section5.4 is a survey of secondary
literature related to Mereology.
In Chap.6 Severi K. Hämari and I focus on a persistent myth about Le´sniewski
and deﬁnitions, according to which it was Le´sniewski who came up with the con-
sistency and conservativeness requirements on deﬁnitions. After some preliminaries
(Sects.6.1 and 6.2) We explain the origins of the folklore (Sects.6.3 and 6.5), elab-
orate on Le´sniewski’s unusual style which contributed to the obscurity of his works
(Sect.6.4), explain why Le´sniewski’s deﬁnitions are creative (section creativity), and
what Le´sniewski’s rules for deﬁnitions actually accomplished (Sect.6.7). Finally, we
argue that most of the credit on the Polish ground should go to Łukasiewicz and
Ajdukiewicz instead (Sect.6.8).
Things get more involved with Chap.7 where I discuss various ways one might
attempt to replace standard set theory within the framework of Le´sniewski’s sys-
tem. In Sects.7.1–7.4 I describe and critically assess Le´sniewski’s and Soboci´nski’s
Soboci´nski(1949b)solution(s)toRussell’sparadox.Themainpointofthispartisthat
the strategy is not successful: there still exists a paradox not noticed by Soboci´nski—
the solution implies that for any two individuals one is an element of the other. In
passing, I also discuss the question whether Ontology itself does not contain enough
set theory (Sect.7.5).
Another strategy of dealing with set-theoretic paradoxes, which employs the so-
called higher-order epsilon connectives, suggested by Lejewski (1985), is discussed
in Sects.7.6 and 7.7. I describe the strategy, apply it to the problems raised by
Le´sniewski and Soboci´nski and show that it falls short of providing with a theory
strong enough to compete with set theory.
Yet another attempt of turning Mereology into a useful tool in foundations of
mathematics, Słupecki (1958) generalized mereology, is presented and assessed in
Sect.7.8. This attempt, however, fails, not only because at certain points it goes
against Le´sniewski’s basic convictions about logic, but also because the resulting
system is, in an important sense, not extensional.

1.2 The Structure of This Book
5
In the last Chap.8 I take a step back. If the Le´sniewskian systems are to serve as
a tool for the nominalist then even before we ask whether and what theories we can
reconstruct within this framework we have to ﬁrst deal with the question whether
the logical systems as they already are do not violate the nominalistic assumptions.
Hence, I turn my attention to the question whether Le´sniewski’s quantiﬁers binding
name variables (or Boolos’ plural quantiﬁers for that matter) commit one to the
existence of sets (understood as abstract objects). First, I introduce the language
of Quantiﬁed Name Logic (QNL) and explain its set–theoretic and substitutional
semantics (Sect.8.2).
Having done that, I discuss the question whether plural quantiﬁcation commits
its users to sets. I start with an argument to the effect that it does (section received).
It ultimately rests on the assumption that the logic obtained with the substitutional
semantics is devoid of certain theoretically preferable features that QNL with set–
theoretic semantics has. I discuss reasons to think that in Sect.8.4.
Then, I discuss some known attempts to provide Ontology (and thus QNL) with a
nominalistically acceptable semantics (Sects.8.5 and 8.6). I ﬁnd both these attempts
lacking, even though the basic intuitions behind them are quite compelling. In
Sect.8.7 I employ those intuitions to develop a more satisfactory semantics. It is
a modal interpretation, where the plural quantiﬁer ‘∃a φ’ (suppose φ does not con-
tain free variables other than a) is intuitively read as ‘it is possible to introduce a name
a which would make φ substitutionally true.’ There is a proof that QNL with Kripke
semantics has the same expressive power as QNL with set–theoretic semantics. In
Sect.8.8 I defend the philosophical viability of this semantics against some known
or potential objections.
1.3 Le´sniewski’s Life and Philosophical Development
Stanisław Le´sniewski was born on March 30th, 1886 in Serpukhov, Russia. From
1899 to 1903 he attended gymnasium in Irkutsk. Next, he spent some time traveling
and studying. He visited Leipzig (1904–1906, he met Wilhelm Wundt), Heidelberg
andZurich(ca.1906–1908),andMunich(wherehestudiedattheLudwigMaximilian
University in 1909). In 1910 he moved to Lvov, where within 2 years he completed
his Ph.D dissertation under Kazimerz Twardowski’s supervision. He spent some
time in Warsaw in 1913. Then, he lived in Kimorciszki and Moscow for some time
before ﬁnally settling in Warsaw, where in 1918 he obtained his habilitation4 was
appointed the Chair of Philosophy of Mathematics at the University of Warsaw. There
he supervised his only Ph.D student, Alfred Tarski, who graduated in 1923 Tarski

One usually has to obtain it to supervise Ph.D students and sometimes to teach certain courses.

Introduction
(1923). He continued teaching at the University of Warsaw till May 13th, 1939, when
he died of thyroid cancer.5
Le´sniewski’s ﬁrst publication was his Ph.D dissertation (1911).6 the between
1911 and 1916 he published regularly. Most his papers from this period were rather
informal, but the problems discussed were related to the philosophy of logic and
mathematics. Quite soon he was drawn to the problems raised by Russell’s paradox
and the debates surrounding the foundations of mathematics. In 1914a he published
his ﬁrst piece on Russell’s paradox (where he already employed some mereological
intuitions) and his 1916 paper contains the ﬁrst formulation of his Mereology (a
formal theory of parthood). Years 1911–1916 are sometimes referred to as the ﬁrst
period of his philosophical activity.
He did not publish anything between 1916 and 1927. After he moved to War-
saw he taught actively and obtained various results whose publication he withheld.
During this period, sometimes dubbed ‘the second period of his philosophical devel-
opment’ he worked on developing his systems: Protothetic (at ﬁrst approximation, a
generalization of propositional logic), Ontology (roughly, a higher-order logic) and
Mereology.
Eventually, he resumed publication. The main item was his “On the Foundations
of Mathematics” series, which consisted of eleven chapters spread over ﬁve volumes
of the Polish Philosophical Journal (Przegl¸a ad Filozoﬁczny). He also published
two papers in Fundamenta Mathematicae concerned with speciﬁcally mathematical
problems (axiomatic theories of groups and Abelian groups), and four separate papers
where he elaborated on his logical systems, Protothetic and Ontology (Mereology,
as a theory of parthood is usually considered an extra-logical theory).
The main events in his biography may be represented by the following chronology:

As far as we know, from the beginning of his philosophical activity Le´sniewski
was concerned with philosophy of logic. While in Lvov, he published his dissertation
in which he discussed truth and analyticity of existential propositions (Le´sniewski
1911).AlreadyinthatpaperheacceptedasomewhatAristotelianviewofthestructure
of predication. He treated ‘is’ as a copula which expresses predication and occurs
between two terms. This is contrasted with the rendering typical for predicate logic,
where one of the terms together with a copula is treated as a predicate, and the other
term (the subject term) has to be singular.
Also, from the beginning he decided that mere logic should not distinguish
between empty, singular and universal terms (referring to, respectively, no, exactly
one, and more than one objects). If one wants to construct a logic to formalize state-
ments of natural language, the intuition behind this decision may be something like
this: logic is supposed to provide us with theses and deductions which stay valid when
we apply them to natural language. When we use terms in natural language, we quite
often do not know (or may be mistaken as to) whether they refer to a unique object
or to anything at all (and indeed, answers to such questions are often extra-logical).
For instance, ‘Socrates is human’, in predicate logic is represented as
‘Human(socrates)’ where the argument has to be a singular term. The same sentence
according to Le´sniewski would be rendered as ‘Socrates ε human’, where (as long
as the syntactic correctness of the formula is involved) both ‘Socrates’ and ‘human’
can be singular, general or even empty terms. So, for instance, also sentences like
‘unicorn ε animal’ or ‘dog ε animal’ would be well–formed, if the language admitted
such natural language terms. (This does not mean that they all would be true, but

Introduction
I will discuss satisfaction conditions of formulas constructed using ε later.) These
speciﬁc features of his approach will later become trademarks of his logical system
of predication called Ontology.
He was also concerned with the validity of the traditional logical principles,
which were discussed quite lively in Poland those days. In 1910 Jan Łukasiewicz
wrote a book in which he intended to undermine the Principle of Contradiction
Łukasiewicz (1910a).7 Soon after, Le´sniewski published a paper (1912) where he
criticized Łukasiewicz.
Another principle that raised concerns was the principle of Excluded Middle.
Łukasiewicz (1910b) tried to undermine it, and Tadeusz Kotarbi´nski criticized the
principle from the indeterministic perspective. He argued that statements about the
future which are not yet causally determined are neither true nor false Kotarbi´nski
(1913). Le´sniewski (1913a,b) disagreed, arguing that the only case of failure of
this principle is when it is interpreted in a very unusual way and when some terms
occurring in a sentence are empty.
Quite soon Le´sniewski became interested in paradoxes and the foundations of
mathematics. In (1914a) he argued that the Russell class does not exist. While doing
so, he tacitly assumed certain principles that hold for mereological fusions, but not
for sets in the classical set theory. In (1916), he provided the ﬁrst construction of his
Mereology. This axiomatized theory of the parthood relation, he later suggested, was
supposed to constitute an alternative to set theory in the foundations of mathematics.
One of the main themes in Le´sniewski’s development is his increasing sympathy
for nominalism. His early argument against universals (1913b) employed the notion
of a property. Later (Le´sniewski 1927, 199), he found this argument insufﬁcient and
provided a formulation which did not seem to him to refer to properties (whose
existence he came to deny). This later formulation is discussed in Sect.4.5.
Between 1916 and 1927, when he was constructing his systems and did not publish
anything, one of his main concerns was to provide a nominalistic description of those
calculi. So, instead of providing an inductive deﬁnition of an inﬁnite set of well-
formed-formulas, he treated formulas as inscription tokens. Instead of speaking of an
inﬁnite set of theorems he spoke of a state of a system at a given moment, meaning
the set of all inscription tokens which have been actually proven. By an actually
proved inscription he meant an inscription token s for which there was a sequence
7
The story is a bit complicated here. First, Łukasiewicz published a book titled O zasadzie
sprzeczno´sci u Arystotelesa. Studium Krytyczne [On the principle of contradiction in Aristotle. A
critical study, (Łukasiewicz 1910a)]. In the same year, he published a paper based on this book titled
“Über den Satz des Widerspruchs bei Aristoteles” [On the principle of contradiction in Aristotle,
(Łukasiewicz 1910c)]. The paper has been translated by Vernon Wedin as Łukasiewicz (1971). Since
then, some people when they write about contradiction cite Łukasiewicz (1971) as the translation
of Łukasiewicz (1910a,b,c) (see e.g. Horn 2009) , as if there was only one Łukasiewicz’s work
from that year. As of now, the 1910 book hasn’t been translated into English. To make things even
more confusing, there is a German translation of the 1910 book (Łukasiewicz 1993) under exactly
the same title as Łukasiewicz’s 1910 paper. One of the authors who get the story right in their
references is Betti (2004b).

of inscription tokens which was a proof of an inscription token equiform8 to s. This
feature made the whole construction cumbersome, especially since another of his
points of ﬁxation was precision. He strove to provide a description of the systems
in a language as precise as possible—the description he provided is usually referred
to as his ‘terminological explanations’. (For the sake of accessibility I will not use
this method. However, it is interesting for its own sake, and I will touch this issue in
Sect. 6.4.)
Le´sniewski’snominalisticinclinationsalsoinspiredhimtoputforwardMereology
as an alternative to set theory. His main objection against set theories was that they
treated sets as abstract objects. He complained that could not even understand what
a set as an abstract object is and insisted that the only way that he can understand
this notion is when sets are thought of as mereological wholes.
He resumed publishing in 1927. From then on, his published works were mainly
concerned with presentation of his logical systems and Mereology. He renounced
his early informal philosophical deliberations9 and focused on formal systems, con-
tinuing to work on them till his death.
1.4 Primary Sources
Below is the list of Le´sniewski’s papers together with English titles and reference to
their original place of publication. All page references in this book refer to the two
volumes of the English edition of Le´sniewski’s collected works Le´sniewski (1991),
even if some translations are slightly corrected. I discuss secondary literature at the
end of each of Chaps.2–5. If the reader is not interested in bibliographical details,
they are free to skip ahead to the next chapter. First, there are papers from the period
1911–1916:
1. “Przyczynek do analizy zda´n egzystencjalnych” (A contribution to the analysis
of existential propositions), (1911).
2. “Próba dowodu ontologicznej zasady sprzeczno´sci” (An attempt at a proof of
the ontological principle of contradiction), (1912).
8 The notion of equiformity played an important part. Instead of speaking of an expression type,
say φ, he explicitly spoke of all tokens equiform to a token φ, where φ was described in terms of its
structure and equiformity of its constituents to certain other tokens. For example, instead of ‘p∧¬p
is not provable in Protothetic’, he would say something more like ‘for every token whose ﬁrst and
fourth constituents are equiform to the following symbol: p, whose second constituent is equiform
to the following symbol: ∧, and whose third constituent is equiform to the following symbol: ¬, no
system of Protothetic (that is, in no inscribed development state of this system) contains a proof (a
sequence of inscription tokens satisfying appropriate conditions) which proves this token.’
9 In (Le´sniewski 1927, 181) he wrote: “Steeped in the inﬂuence of John Stuart Mill in which I
mainly grew up, and ‘conditioned’ by the problems of ‘universal–grammar’ and of logic-semantics
in the style of Edward Husserl and by the exponents of the so–called Austrian School, I ineffectually
attacked the foundations of ‘logistic’ from this point of view.”

7. “Podstawy ogólnej teoryi mnogo´sci I” (Foundations of the general theory of

The (1916) paper was the last one written in the early period, and also the ﬁrst
that dealt with the issues discussed in details in the series of papers between 1927
and 1931, titled “On the Foundations of Mathematics I–XI”. The list of all parts of
this series together with their references is:
1. “O podstawach matematyki. Wst¸ep. Rozdział I: O pewnych kwestjach,

of sets from the years 1921–1923. XI. On ‘singular’ propositions of the type
‘Aεb’), (1931a).
While working on this series, Le´sniewski also published two papers which were
more concerned with speciﬁc mathematical topics rather than with foundations of
mathematics: “Über Funktionen, deren Felder Abelsche Gruppen in bezug auf diese
Funktionen sind” (On functions whose ﬁelds with respect to these functions are
Abelian groups) (1929c) and “Über Funktionen, deren Felder Gruppen mit Rücksicht
auf diese Funktionen sind” (On functions whose ﬁelds, w.r.t. these functions are
groups) (1929d) simplify axiomatizations of two mathematical theories (Abelian
group theory and group theory respectively).
In 1929 Le´sniewski also published a paper concerned with a description of Pro-
tothetic: “Grundzüge eines neuen Systems der Grundlagen der Mathematic §1–11”
(Fundamentals of a new system of the foundations of mathematics, §1–11) (1929a).
In “Über die Grundlagen der Ontologie” (On the Foundations of Ontology)
(1930b) he presented an outline of his Ontology and in “Über Deﬁnitionen in der
sogenannten Theorie der Deduction” (On deﬁnitions in the so-called theory of deduc-
tion) (1931b) he formalized the requirements he put on deﬁnitions in his systems.
In 1938 he was preparing for publication in Collectanea Logica10 two papers:
“Einleitende Bemerkungen zur Fortsetzung meiner Mitteilung u.d.T. ‘Grundzüge
eines neuen Systems der Grundlagen der Mathematik”’ (Introductory remarks to
the continuation of my article: fundamentals of a new system of the foundations of
mathematics) (1938a), where he elaborates on how he had formulated Protothetic
and explains some of its basic principles, and “Grundzüge eines neuen Systems der
Grundlagen der Mathematik, §12” (Fundamentals of a new system of the founda-
tions of mathematics §12) (1938b) where he hints at another, so-called computative
formulation of Protothetic. Those were never published, but preprints survive in the
Harvard College Library.
Another invaluable source is a set of notes made by Le´sniewski’s students. Most of
the text consists of formal symbols, theorems and proofs. The notes have been gath-
ered, translated into English and edited by Srzednicki and Stachniak (1988). There
are two parts to that book: (a) foundations of mathematics, (b) Peano arithmetic and
Whitehead’s theory of events. The ﬁrst part is divided into: “From the Foundations

Chapter 2
Le´sniewski’s Early Philosophical Views
Abstract I focus on Le´sniewski’s papers written before he published formal work
on his systems. I begin with a discussion of what Le´sniewski called linguistic con-
ventions: various postulates introduced to elucidate the meaning and role of certain
natural language devices. Then I show how he used them to draw conclusions about
existential propositions, the principle of contradiction, the principle of excluded
middle, the eternity of truth and the existence of abstract objects. I also explain
his approach to paradoxes: Nelson–Grelling’s, Meinong’s, Epimenides’ (the Liar),
and Russell’s. All Le´sniewski’s arguments are carefully reconstructed and critically
assessed.
2.1 Introductory Remarks
It was not until the late 1920s that Le´sniewski started publishing on the systems of
logic for which he is famous. Before 1920, he devoted his papers to certain issues in
the philosophy of logic and mathematics. However, most of his investigations from
that time did not involve any formalized or axiomatized system. He conducted them
informally.
Among the problems he discussed were the logical properties of existential propo-
sitions, the justiﬁcation of the Principle of Contradiction, the value of the Principle
of Excluded Middle, the eternity of truth, and a few paradoxes: Meinong’s, Nelson-
Grelling’s, Epimenides’ and, most importantly, Russell’s.
Le´sniewski in 1927 apparently repudiated his earlier results (1927, 181–182).
Nevertheless, some of his arguments are interesting. Even if not all of them are
philosophically compelling, they do cast some light on how his thought developed.
Moreover, the reader has the right to assess these early views on his own instead of
trusting Le´sniewski’s self–criticism.
I begin with a discussion of what Le´sniewski called his linguistic conventions and
I list the basic conventions that he accepted in years 1911–1914. Next, I show how he

Le´sniewski’s Early Philosophical Views
applied those conventions to various problems. That is, I discuss what conclusions
those conventions helped him to draw about existential propositions, the principle
of contradiction, the principle of excluded middle, the eternity of truth, and how
he attempted to solve a few paradoxes: Nelson–Grelling’s, Meinong’s, Epimenides’
(the Liar), and Russell’s. Finally I say a few words about his rejection of abstract
objects.
2.2 Linguistic Conventions
Le´sniewski’s linguistic conventions are various restrictions he put on natural lan-
guage to obtain its more regulated version. Those include deﬁnitions, which specify
how he uses some terms, some general conditions on what the truth conditions of
various types of statements are, and some other assumptions about the language of
the discourse which are hard to classify.1
Le´sniewski claimed that if we rely only on common sense, it is hard to see any
way out of paradoxes that arise in natural language (like the Liar, which arises when
we ask ourselves whether “This sentence is false” is true or false). Commenting on
his solution to the Liar (where he employed the assumption than no noun phrase
token refers to any expression token of which it is a part) he explained:
It is also correct to say that the above–mentioned convention is ‘arbitrary’ in the sense that
it conﬂicts with ‘natural intuitions’ of language. […] Since, keeping to ‘natural intuitions’
of language we get involved in irresolvable paradoxes, these ‘intuitions’ seem to imply
contradiction. The ‘artiﬁcial’ frame of strict conventions is thus a far better instrument of
reason than the language dissolving in the opaque contours of ‘natural’ habits which often
imply incurable contradictions—much as the ‘artiﬁcially’ regulated Panama Canal is a better
waterway than the ‘natural’ rapids on the Dnieper. (1913b, 82)
Although he did not use the term ‘compositional’, one of his main worries
about natural language was that in natural language the symbolic function (which
is Le´sniewski’s idiosyncratic term for something like ‘reference’ or ‘semantic role’,
read on for details) of a complex expression is not a straightforward result of the
symbolic function of its components. In order to (1) avoid paradoxes that we run into
when reasoning in natural language and (2) explain how the symbolic function of a
complex expression results from the symbolic functions of its constituents (and the
way they are related to each other in this complex expression) Le´sniewski introduced
some deﬁnitions and postulates which were supposed to regulate the language that
he used. He called them linguistic conventions. Here is how he explained why they
are needed:
The symbolic function of complex linguistic constructions, e.g., propositions, depends on
the symbolic functions of the elements of these constructions, that is individual words,
and on their mutual relationship. In the unplanned process of development of language,
1 For instance, Tarski-style hierarchization of natural language seems to be a regimentation of the
same sort.

2.2 Linguistic Conventions
17
the symbolic function of propositions can depend in some particular cases on identical
symbolic functions and on identical relationship between speciﬁc words—in quite differ-
ent ways. The planned construction of complex linguistic forms cannot, for representing
various contents in the system of theoretical propositions, be conﬁned within the possible
results of the unplanned evolution of language. Such construction calls for the formation of
certain general conventional-normative schemas to embody the dependence of the symbolic
functions of propositions on the symbolic functions of their elements, and on the mutual
relationship between these elements. To ascertain whether the given content has been repre-
sented adequately or inadequately in a proposition, one has to analyze individually how the
speaker’s representational intentions relate to the above-mentioned schemas. These schemas
should indicate in what way the symbolic function of a proposition should be conditioned
[determined R.U.] by the symbolic functions of the particular words and by their mutual
relationship. (1911, 16–17)
And also:
I have more than once pointed out that a system of linguistic symbols, just as any other
system of symbols, e.g., the system of railway signals, requires the existence of certain rules
for constructing the symbols and keys for reading them.2 I have repeatedly stressed that the
functions of various complex linguistic structures, e.g., those of propositions, should depend,
in a correctly constructed precise language, upon the functions or the order of particular
words—on the basis of certain patterns determined by general normative conventions the
knowledge of which permits the correct symbolization of an object in a given language or
the decoding of a symbol for a given language. Taking into account the need so speciﬁed
for a precise language, I established, in my previous papers, various linguistic conventions
indicating on what rules the system of linguistic symbols is based and how to understand
statements about some constructions which I used in analysis. (1913b, 56)
So, one reason for introducing conventions was to avoid paradoxes. Another one
was that the trust we usually have in natural language intuition, though mainly suf-
ﬁcient for everyday communication, does not allow us to avoid ambiguities in more
complicated cases and does not provide any method of resolving misunderstandings.
Finally, he thought that conventions were needed to ensure the compositionality of
symbolic function.
In his early work, Le´sniewski did not codify those conventions in a manner typical
for an axiomatic system. To a large extent, they are to be found here and there in his
papers, sometimes introduced quite ad hoc in order to approach a speciﬁc problem.
I will list and discuss those conventions in this section, and in the later sections I
will show how Le´sniewski applied them. Let us begin with some conventions from
(1912, 31–42):
(2.1) All expressions are divided into connoting and non-connoting.
(2.2) An expression is connoting iff it can be deﬁned.3
2 Le´sniewski’s father was a railroad engineer.
3 “I divide all linguistic expressions into connoting and non-connoting; I adopt the expression
‘connoting expression’ to denote expressions that can be deﬁned, and the expression ‘non-connoting
expression’ to denote expressions that cannot be deﬁned. The expressions ‘man’, ‘green’, ‘square
circle’, ‘centaur’ are examples of connoting expressions; the expressions ‘to a man’, ‘well’, ‘at’,
‘abracadabra’, ‘object’, ‘every man is mortal’, etc. are examples of non-connoting expressions.”
(1911, 31)

Le´sniewski’s Early Philosophical Views
Le´sniewski, at least in the early period, seems to have followed Aristotle in his
account of deﬁnitions.4 The way his train of thought develops indicates that ‘can
be deﬁned’ should be read as ‘can be deﬁned by means of a classic deﬁnition’. A
classic deﬁnition has the form: ‘A is a B which is C’. Following Aristotle, A here
is the deﬁned expression, B is called the genus proximum (the closest kind) and C
is a differentia speciﬁca (speciﬁc difference). C has to somehow determine B, in the
sense that either not every B should be C, or C should be a conjunction of more
properties than B. Thus, for instance, ‘square circle’ is a connoting expression, for
we can say ‘A square circle is a circle which is a square’. In contrast, ‘how are you’
is not a connoting expression on this view, because for no B and C we can say: ‘How
are you is a B which is C’.
(2.3) All expressions divide into denoting and non-denoting. Denoting expressions are
those which refer to (symbolize) something that exists, while non-denoting expressions
are those that do not refer to any existing object. For example, the following expressions
denote something: ‘man’, ‘green’, ‘object’, ‘the fact that every man possesses the property
of mortality’, ‘every man is mortal’. The relation of denoting is called a symbolic relation.
An expression which denotes something is said to possess a symbolic function.5
(2.4) If an expression can be used and treated as having a symbolic function, it is said to
have a symbolic disposition.
The distinction between having a symbolic function and having a symbolic dis-
position is the difference between actually referring and being able to refer without
4 The similarity between Le´sniewski and Aristotle can be observed at least insofar as we speak of the
form of a deﬁnition:
“Because there is nothing else in the deﬁnition
besides the primary genus and the differentiae.” (Met., Z, 1037b, 29–30) Aristotle’s approach is more
metaphysically involved, because he attaches special status to
(the closest kind)
and
(speciﬁc differences). These notions are strongly connected
with his metaphysics.
5 “I divide all linguistic expressions into those denoting something and those denoting nothing, in
other words symbolizing something and symbolizing nothing or expressions which are symbols
and those which are not. I call the relation of expressions to the objects denoted (in other words—
symbolized) by these expressions, a symbolic relation. I call that property of an expression which
consistsinitssymbolizingsomething,thesymbolicfunctionofthatexpression.Anexpressionwhich
denotes something, or which possesses the symbolic function, can be exempliﬁed by the following:
‘man’, ‘green’, ‘object’, ‘the possessing by every man of the property of mortality’, ‘every man is
mortal’, etc. The expressions which do not denote anything, or do not possess symbolic functions,
can be exempliﬁed by the following ones: ‘abracadabra’, ‘square circle’, ‘centaur’, ‘the possessing
by every man of the property of immortality’, ‘every man is immortal’, etc. The expression ‘square
circle’ does not possess a symbolic function because no object is a square circle, in other words there
isnosuchobjectascouldbesymbolizedbytheexpression‘squarecircle’;thustheexpression‘square
circle’ symbolizes no object, in other words symbolizes nothing. The expressions ‘possessing by
every man of the property of immortality’, ‘every man is immortal’ do not possess a symbolic
function because no man is immortal, in other words there is no object that could be symbolized by
the aforementioned expressions. Therefore, these expressions symbolize no objects, or symbolize
nothing.” (1911, 31–32) It is interesting that among denoting expressions Le´sniewski included true
sentences, but not false sentences. He was not too explicit about what sentences refer to, but it
seems that rather than accepting Fregean Truth, he rather took them to refer to facts or relations of
inherence between objects and properties.

2.2 Linguistic Conventions
19
any change on the part of the language.6 Empty names and false sentences have a
symbolic disposition but not a symbolic function. Names referring to objects and
true sentences have both.7
(2.5) Connoting expressions having symbolic function divide into expressions for which
there is a non-connoting expression which symbolizes the same object, and expressions for
which there is no such non-connoting expression. For instance, the expression ‘the fact that
every man is mortal’ denotes the fact that every man is mortal. There is a corresponding
non-connoting expression: ‘every man is mortal’, which denotes the same fact. By contrast,
for the connoting expression ‘cow’ there is no non-connoting expression denoting the same
object(s).
(2.6) Accordingly, connoting expressions possessing a symbolic disposition divide into
expressions for which there is a non-connoting expressions having the same symbolic dis-
position, and those for which there is no such connoting expression.8
(2.7) Non-connoting expressions for which there is a connoting expression having the same
symbolic disposition are called propositions. (1911, 34)9
(2.8) A proposition is true iff it possesses a symbolic function. Otherwise, it is false. (1911,
34–35)
(2.9) A simple afﬁrmative proposition (that is, a proposition not having a proposition as
its proper part) is of the form ‘S is P’ and it symbolizes the relation of inherence between
the object denoted by the subject and the properties connoted by the predicate. An atomic
proposition is true if and only if the object denoted by the subject has all the properties
connoted by the predicate.10
6 I add this reservation, because Le´sniewski wouldn’t say that, for instance, ’how are you’ has a
symbolic disposition just because someone can use this phrase to name an elephant.
7 “I call the property of an expression which consists in that expression’s application or treat-
ment (according to, or against, the adopted linguistic conventions) as one possessing the sym-
bolic function, the symbolic disposition of that expression. Thus, e.g., I say that the expressions:
‘man’, ‘hippocentaur’, ‘every man is mortal’, ‘the possessing by a hippocentaur of the property
of horseness’—possess a symbolic disposition when they are applied, or treated as expression-
symbols. The ﬁrst and third of these expressions possess a symbolic function, but the second and
fourth do not because no object is a hippocentaur or the possession by a hippocentaur of the property
of horsiness.” (1911, 33)
8 “All connoting expressions possessing a symbolic function can be divided into two groups:
expressions which correspond with any non-connoting expression symbolizing the same object,
and expressions which correspond with no non-connoting expression symbolizing the same object.
Thus, e.g., the connoting expression ‘the possessing by every man of the property of mortality’
corresponds with a non-connoting expression symbolizing the same object, namely the expression
‘every man is mortal’. The latter also symbolizes the possessing by every man of the property
of mortality and also the expression ‘the possessing by every man of the property of mortality’.
Whereas the connoting expression ‘man’ corresponds with no non-connoting expression which
would symbolize the same objects as those symbolized by the word ‘man’.
All connoting expressions possessing a symbolic disposition can be divided into two groups:
expressions which correspond to any non-connoting expression possessing the same symbolic
disposition, and expressions which correspond to no such non-connoting expression.”(1911, 34)
9 Whenever I refer to someone’s work, it is my reading of the text, unless quotation marks are
present.
10 “…any proposition possessing a symbolic function symbolizes the possessing by the object, sym-
bolized by the subject of that proposition, of properties connoted by its predicate. This convention

Le´sniewski’s Early Philosophical Views
(2.10) “A proposition having a denoting subject and a connoting predicate possesses a
symbolic function if[f]11 a singular proposition being its contradictory counterpart does not
possess the symbolic function.”(1911, 36)
It seems that by ‘the relation of inherence between an object and a property’
Le´sniewski does not mean one and the same relation for all true simple sentences.
Rather, he means something like “relation tokens”. For him, whenever we have two
true atomic sentences such that either their subjects symbolize different objects or
the predicates symbolize different properties, the relations of inherence involved are
numerically different.
(2.11) “No contradictory proposition possesses a symbolic function.”12 (1911, 36)
(2.12) “If one of two propositions contradicting each other possesses a symbolic function,
then the other will not possess one.” (1911, 36)
(2.13) A proposition is true a priori iff its truth can be demonstrated by means of linguistic
conventions alone. It is false a priori iff its falsehood can be demonstrated by means of
linguistic conventions alone.13 (1911, 36)
Now, a few conventions to be found elsewhere:
(2.14) “[A] connoting expression W represents any object possessing the properties con-
noted by the expression ‘W’—with the exception of the expression ‘W’ itself together with
those expressions which have at least one element in common with the expression ‘W’.”
(1913b, 64)
Le´sniewski was a nominalist (I discuss his argument against universals later on).
The above convention about what connoting expressions denote is to be understood
as being about what nowadays we would call tokens: utterances and inscriptions. As
we will see Sect.(2.8.3), he relied on this move in his response to the Liar paradox.
(Footnote 10 continued)
implies that propositions can symbolize only the relations of inherence.”(1911, 36) What is some-
what interesting, Le´sniewski, instead of saying that this refers only to simple (atomic) propositions
adds a footnote which says: “…I speak of propositions in the sense of the ones reduced to the
form of categorical propositions with positive copulas and predicates in the Nominative.” (1911,
36) which seems to suggest the claim that all propositions are reducible to propositions of this
speciﬁc form. This claim however is not essential for further discussion; neither does Le´sniewski
give a complete set of directions describing how this reduction should proceed for any arbitrary
proposition. Therefore, I decided to treat (2.9) as referring to simple propositions only, without
assuming the claim about the reducibility of complex propositions (which is implausible anyway).
11 Le´sniewski in his early writings used ‘if’ in deﬁnitions in the sense of ‘iff’.
12 Some conventions I just quote, if they were originally phrased in a concise manner. If I ﬁnd a
simpler and more accessible reformulation, I use it instead.
13 Probably ‘alone’ should be read as ‘as the only extralogical assumptions.’ “I call false a priori all
such propositions whose falseness can be demonstrated by means of linguistic conventions alone or
the propositions which can be inferred from those conventions. …On the analogy of the deﬁnition
of the expression ‘proposition false a priori’, I deﬁne the expression ‘proposition true a priori’.
I employ the latter expression to denote such propositions whose validity can be demonstrated
by means of linguistic conventions alone or the propositions which can be inferred from these
conventions.”

2.2 Linguistic Conventions
21
(2.15) A simple afﬁrmative proposition is analytic iff it contains no predicates which con-
note properties that are not connoted by the subject. It is synthetic if it contains predicates
which connote (also) such a property (properties) that are not connoted by the subject.
Here is how Le´sniewski phrased the distinction:
I use the expression ‘analytic proposition’ to denote propositions which, being of the form
of propositions with positive copulas, contain no predicates which connote properties that
are not connoted by the subject. I use the expression ‘synthetic proposition’ to denote those
propositions which, being of the form of propositions with positive copulas, contain pred-
icates which connote also such properties that are not connoted by the subject. Thus, e.g.,
the propositions ‘a man has two hands’, ‘an orphan does not have a mother’ are analytic
if we use the word ‘man’ in the sense of ‘mammal with two hands and two legs’, and the
word ‘orphan’ in the sense of ‘human being that has neither father nor mother’; it is because
the properties connoted by the predicates of the propositions with positive copulas—‘man
is what has two hands’ and ‘an orphan is what does not have a mother’—that is the prop-
erties of having two hands and not having a mother—are connoted by the subjects: ‘man’
and ‘orphan’. The propositions: ‘man creates God in his own likeness’ or ‘an orphan never
knows a caress in his life’, on the other hand, are synthetic because the properties connoted
by the predicates of the propositions with positive copulas: ‘man is what creates God to his
own likeness’ and ‘an orphan is what does not know a caress in its life’, that is the properties
of creating God to one’s own likeness and of not knowing a caress in one’s life, are not
connoted by the subjects. (1911, 2–3)
(2.16) A proposition with a negative copula (‘is not’) reduces to a proposition with the
same subject, positive copula and a predicate generated by preceding the predicate of the
previous sentence by ‘non’, e.g. ‘S is not a P’ reduces to ‘S is a non-P.’ 14
Le´sniewski also introduced a convention about proper names which, although not
used afterwards, is interesting in itself:
(2.17) Proper names connote the property of possessing a name which sounds like a given
proper name. Proper names denote different objects univocally. For example ‘James’ denotes
every James in the same sense (as far as there is more than one person called ‘James’).
Since Le´sniewski’s views on proper names are quite uncommon we will take a closer
look at this view in Sect.2.3.
2.3 A Digression on Proper Names
Let us start with Le´sniewski’s formulation of the view expressed in (2.17):
14 “…a proposition with a negative copula can symbolize possessing, by the object denoted by the
subject of that proposition, properties connoted by the expression consisting of the word ‘not’ and
the predicate of the proposition with a negative copula in question (the negation ‘not’ is to apply to
the whole expression that follows it). If the proposition with a negative copula has the form: ‘no etc
…’, then the word ‘no’ will be substituted, in the process of reduction, by the word ‘every’. Thus
the proposition with a negative copula ‘no object can both possess and not possess one and the same
property’ …symbolizes the possessing by the object denoted by the subject of that sentences …the
possessing by every object of properties connoted by the expression consisting of the word ‘not’
and the predicate of the proposition with a negative copula—that is, the expression ‘able to both
possess and not possess one and the same property’.” (1912, 23)

Le´sniewski’s Early Philosophical Views
J.S. Mill says that not all names have connotations. Among those which have no connotations
are, according to Mill, proper names such as, e.g., Paul, Caesar on the one hand, and some
of the names of attributes on the other. If this were really so, one could foresee certain
difﬁculties in regarding as analytic those positive existential propositions whose subjects
are just such names without connotation. Yet even the names which I have mentioned and
which according to Mill have no connotation, in my opinion, have connotation; proper
names connote the property of possessing a name which sounds like the given proper name,
whereas the names of attributes regarded by Mill as lacking connotation, connote either the
property of possessing such names, or the property of complete identity with entities which
bear such names. Thus, e.g., the name ‘Paul’ connotes the property of having the name
‘Paul’, the name ‘redness’ connotes the property of having the name ‘redness’. Instead of
‘Paul’ we can then say ‘a being which has the name ‘Paul”, instead of ‘redness’—a being
which is completely identical with beings that bear the name ‘redness’…I shall touch here
upon Husserl’s thesis that one proper name, e.g., Socrates’, can name various objects only
because it is ambiguous, just as names such as ‘redness’; I do not think this is the case—
these names would be equivocal only if, while denoting various objects, they also connoted
different properties. In fact the word ‘Socrates’, while denoting different objects, connotes
always one property, that is the property of bearing the name ‘Socrates’. [translation slightly
corrected R.U.] (1911, 5–6)
This view is not just merely a descriptive theory of proper names. The descriptive
theory postulates that for any proper name there is a deﬁnite description which
uniquely determines its reference. This already assumes that proper names, taken
univocally, pick out their referents uniquely. On the other hand, Le´sniewski suggested
that proper names are not only connotative (as Russell or Frege may be read to
have suggested), but also that they are, in a sense, general terms. There are at least
three controversial claims about proper names that Le´sniewski seems to have been
committed to:
(2.18) For any proper name n it is possible that there are at least two different objects, o1
and o2 such that if terms n1 and n2 refer uniquely to o1 and o2 respectively, then both ‘n1 is
n’ and ‘n2 is n’ are true.
(2.19) For any object o, o is a referent of a proper name n iff o has a property of being
named by n.
(2.20) The property described in (2.19) is the only property connoted by n.
One might object to (2.18) by saying that whenever we use a proper name, we seem to
(or at least we are trying to) refer to a unique object. One can also argue against (2.19)
by insisting that it’s prima facie implausible if we apply possible-world semantics.
For indeed, take the name ‘Aristotle’. It seems that Aristotle could have been named
with a different proper name than the name which he actually was given. Thus, there
appears to be a possible world where Aristotle does not possess the property of being
named ‘Aristotle’.15 (2.20) seems suspicious because it seems circular: to know what
n refers to, I have to know what property it connotes. Yet, to know which object has
the property connoted by n I already have to know which object is named by n, and
therefore which object n refers to.
15 See (Kripke 1980) regarding related issues.

2.3 A Digression on Proper Names
23
The objections are not conclusive, though. The fact that whenever we use a noun
phrase m we tend to refer to a unique object does not entail that it is not possible
that m has more than one referent. This is pretty straightforward and does not require
additional arguments. Note also that there are some terms which are general, but
which are in the majority of their uses taken as referring to exactly one object (like
‘father’ or ‘mother’). That is, what a term in one of its uses is taken to refer to is not
ﬁxed by its connotation only, but also by pragmatic considerations.
Second, proper names in some rare uses are taken to refer to multiple objects. For
instance, if a superstitious parapsychologist who believes in “the power of names”
says ‘Jacob is always impolite’ she does not have to refer to any speciﬁc person.
Rather, she might be understood as saying ‘Everyone whose name is ‘Jacob’ is
impolite’. Or, she may say ‘Every Jacob is impolite’, which seems to be a normal
case of quantiﬁcation and, unless some other reasons against this reading are given,
can be treated as such.
It is also sometimes admissible (however uncommon) to use a plural form of a
proper name to refer to a few bearers of this name simultaneously. One of languages
in which this happens is Polish. For example, if there are two men, each of them
being named ‘Rafal’, you might say (in Polish): ‘The Rafals went to the store’ if it is
clear from the context that those two men are the only Rafals you might be referring
to.
The objection against (2.19) is not really lethal either. What it indicates, though, is
that (2.19) has to be reformulated. Although the example mentioned in the objection
may falsify (2.19) in one of its readings, consider the following intuitive emendation:
(2.21) For any object o, o is a referent of a proper name n (in a language L) iff n has the
property of being named by n (in L).
where by ‘being named’ we speak of some sort of procedure typical for the way
proper names are introduced in a given language.
It is true that the object named ‘Aristotle’ (in English) in the actual world in
another possible world is not named ‘Aristotle’ in any of the languages existing in
that possible world. Still, it is true about Aristotle in such possible world that his
name is ‘Aristotle’ in actual English. This indicates that the connotations of proper
names on Le´sniewski’s view are better to be interpreted as not purely descriptive,
for the reference to the actual language to which the proper name belongs is rigid.
A more serious concern comes to mind when we ask ourselves how informative
(2.17) really is and we doubt whether (2.20) is not circular. Its main claim is that
“proper names connote the property of possessing a name which sounds like a given
proper name.” If this is supposed to explain how names refer, it does not do much
more than saying:
[PNA] A proper name denotes the object(s) having the property of being denoted by it.
or
[PNB] The sense of a proper name n (in L) is ‘an object denoted by n (in L)’.

24

Le´sniewski’s Early Philosophical Views
On the face of it, both options are problematic. [PNA] is uninformative: it uses the
notion of denotation of a proper name to explain what a proper name denotes. [PNB]
in an explanation of what sense of a proper name is uses the notion of denotation of a
proper name, thus blocking the possibility of using the sense of a name in explaining
what it denotes.
Perhaps there are viable ways of facing these challenges. Maybe the notion of
denotation on the right-hand side of [PNA] differs from the one on the left-hand
side. Maybe an interesting interplay of the notions of sense and (various deﬁnitions
of) denotation can be developed to show [PNB] says something philosophically
plausible. Alas, Le´sniewski did not get into any more detail and never returned to
the issue.
This sort of approach, dubbed nominal description theory of proper names, have
been developed in more detail recently by Kent Bach. Bach, most likely indepen-
dently of Le´sniewski, formulated the view on which “when a proper name occurs in
a sentence it expresses no substantive property but merely the property of bearing
that very name.” (Bach 2002, 73).16 Alas, a longer discussion of Bach’s views lies
beyond the scope of this book. Let us get back to Le´sniewski and his account of
existential propositions.
2.4 Existential Propositions
Le´sniewski’s ﬁrst publication (1911) was concerned with the properties of existential
propositions. This is also the ﬁrst time he applied his conventions. His claims in that
paper were somewhat unusual. On his view, all positive existential propositions are
analytic and yet false. Also, some negative existential propositions are analytic and
false and some are synthetic, but contradictory and therefore false.
For Le´sniewski all existential propositions are atomic. A positive existential
proposition is of the form: ‘S exists’ or equivalently: ‘S is a being’ (1911, 3). A
negative existential proposition has the form: ‘S does not exist’ or ‘S is not a being’
where ‘being’ is a noun phrase meaning the same as Latin ens, Greek on, or English
object.
Following convention (2.1) we know that ‘being’ connotes something only if it
can be deﬁned by means of a classic deﬁnition. However, to form such a deﬁnition,
we would have to ﬁnd such B and C that:
(2.22) [A] being is a B which is C.
would be a classic deﬁnition. To make such a deﬁnition work, B would have to be a
name wider than ‘being’. However, (and that is another concept taken from Aristotle)
16 See also (Katz 1990).

2.4 Existential Propositions
25
there is no name wider than ‘being’ or ‘object’. Everything that can be named is an
object, and as such, a being of some sort.17
Thus, on Le´sniewski’s view, there is no deﬁnition of ‘being’, and the name ‘being’
does not connote anything. This, together with convention (2.15) entails:
(2.23) All positive existential propositions are analytic.
Recall that according to (2.15) a positive atomic proposition is analytic if and only if
its predicate does not connote properties which are not connoted by the subject. Since
‘being’ does not connote anything, whatever is the subject of a positive existential
proposition, its predicate does not connote anything which is not connoted by the
subject. At least, this is Le´sniewski’s argument for this claim.
Nevertheless, every positive existential proposition is, according to Le´sniewski,
false. His argument is based on convention (2.9). Indeed, ‘S is a being’ is true iff S has
all properties connoted by ‘being’. But, since there are no such properties, it is false
that S has them. (The fact that Le´sniewski thought this argument sound indicates
that he treated a sentence of the form ‘all A are B’ as implying the existence of some
A’s. If, instead, (2.9) was read as saying that it is true iff no properties connoted by
the predicate are not had by the object(s) denoted by the subject, the argument would
not go through.)
Now consider negative existential propositions. There are two options. A negative
existential proposition is either analytic or it is synthetic.
If ‘S’ itself connotes the property of non-being, then ‘S is a non-being’ is ana-
lytic, and yet false. According to Le´sniewski, atomic propositions with contradictory
subjects are contradictory themselves, and cannot be true (2.11).
If ‘S’ does not connote the property of non-being, ‘S is a non-being’ is synthetic
and S is only said to have the property of non-being. But every ‘S’ is reducible to a
name phrase ‘being which has properties A1, A2, A3, . . .’. So we have a proposition
saying something equivalent to:
The being which has properties A1, A2, A3, . . ., is not a being.
which is a contradictory proposition.
Le´sniewski’s conclusions are unusual. He defended his claims despite their lack
of intuitive support. So, ﬁrst, it might be objected that the deﬁnitions that he uses in
proving his conclusions are artiﬁcial. For Le´sniewski, the relevance of a classiﬁcation
17 “I have said that the predicate of a positive existential proposition which has been brought to
the form of a proposition with a positive copula, does not connote anything, except—at most—the
property of being greater than one. I maintain this because such a predicate is synonymous with
the words ‘being’ or ‘beings’ which connote nothing else, even though they denote (‘denotation’ as
used by Mill) everything. This view conﬂicts with J.S. Mill’s theory which says the word ‘being’
connotes the property of existing. I consider Mill’s theory wrong because, should the word ‘being’
really connote the property of existing, we could deﬁne that word as ‘that which has the property
of existing’, or in other words, as a ‘being which has the property of existing’ (since the deﬁnition
must indicate not only differentiae speciﬁcae, but also the genus); this would, then, give rise to an
inevitable regressus in inﬁnitum. The word ‘being’ cannot be in fact deﬁned at all; the statement
that this word does not connote anything is fully in keeping with this fact.” (1911, 4–5)

Le´sniewski’s Early Philosophical Views
dependsonitstheoreticalusefulness,thatis,onwhetheritallowsuseithertoconstruct
propositions or theories concerning all and only those objects which fall under one
of the classes that our classiﬁcation singles out. And indeed, he thought that his
classiﬁcation makes it easier to put forward some theoretical claims about all and
only (simple) analytic propositions and other claims concerning all and only (simple)
synthetic propositions. Some examples that Le´sniewski gave were: ‘All analytic
propositions (and only these propositions) contain no such information about the
objects symbolized by the subjects, that could not be deduced from the meaning of
the subjects’ and ‘All synthetic propositions (and only these propositions) contain
such information about the objects symbolized by the subjects’ (1911, 9–10).18
One might think, all Le´sniewski did is he introduced a few deﬁnitions which,
together with some assumptions about how the language works, implied some bizarre
claims. They sound awkward because the terms employed mean something different
from what we usually associate with those terms. Le´sniewski, however, treated his
conclusions as if they actually held for natural language. Here is what he says about
that:
The idea expressed in the preceding section contradicts current opinions concerning existen-
tial propositions: the possibility of constructing both positive and negative, true existential
propositions is commonly accepted. Thus e.g., both the proposition ‘people exist’ and the
proposition ‘square circles do not exist’ are considered true.
I have taken pains to demonstrate the groundlessness of this common attitude towards exis-
tential propositions, all that remains for me to do is to cast some light on the probable origin
of such a widespread error. [emphasis mine] (1911, 15)
He also suggested that his views about analytic propositions were claims about the
samegroupofpropositionswhichwasreferredtobyotherlogiciansandphilosophers:
18 About the idea that some classiﬁcations are natural and some are artiﬁcial he says: “One hears,
from time to time, of ‘natural’ and ‘artiﬁcial’ methods of classiﬁcation. People who use this form
of expression do not usually limit themselves in characterizing particular methods of classiﬁcation,
to the inclusion of these descriptively to either of the above categories; they usually combine
such a descriptive characterization of methods of classiﬁcation with the teleological element of
valuation, and they value ‘natural’ classiﬁcations higher than artiﬁcial’ ones. The origins of the
above characterizations of methods of classiﬁcation, and the positive or negative estimations which
accompany these characterizations, can vary immensely from case to case.
Some such cases are determined by various linguistic habits and traditions, others—by more or
less well thought out and justiﬁed views concerning the problems of theoretical usefulness.
The classiﬁcation of propositions into analytic and synthetic which I have carried out …can be,
in view of at least one of its consequences, characterized as regarded by some as ‘artiﬁcial’. Such an
‘objection’ can in the ﬁrst place originate from the fact that one of the two classiﬁcation labels, i.e.,
that of analytic propositions, comprises two ‘very’ or ‘too’ heterogenous groups of propositions:
(1) propositions whose predicates connote any properties but not those connoted by the subjects’,
and (2) propositions whose predicates do not connote the properties connoted by the subjects only
because they do not connote any features.
I do not consider it my task to tone down all such dissonances if they arise solely from deeply
rooted emotional impulses resulting from some linguistic habits, yet I cannot miss the opportunity
to provide my classiﬁcation of propositions with a ‘safety valve’ against objections supported by
arguments of theoretical usefulness of my classiﬁcation.” (1911, 9)

2.4 Existential Propositions
27
In modern logic there is a widespread conviction that all analytic propositions are true. Those
who advocate such a privileged position of analytic propositions in science claim that the
principle of contradiction would be in jeopardy if any proposition could be false in spite of
its being analytic […But] some analytic propositions might be true, while others might be
false. […] Thus, those scholars who hold that all analytic propositions are necessarily true
propositions are in error. (1913b, 61–62)
A more moderate conclusion to draw would be that one can take the Kantian
deﬁnition of analyticity as inclusion of the subject in the predicate quite literally, and
that with the aid of Le´sniewski’s other assumptions, one can argue that this deﬁnition
does not coincide with the notion of ‘being true in virtue of meaning’.19
Anyway, Le´sniewski goes on to point out that sentences that seem to be true and
existential are misrepresented and their “adequate verbal symbols would be non-
existential propositions” (1911, 15), that is, instead of ‘S exist(s)’, if we take it to be
true, we should use ‘Some being(s) is(/are) S’ and by ‘S does not exist’ we should use
‘No being(s) is(/are) S’, if we want to represent our beliefs and intentions adequately.
His explanation of how he got to this conclusions is somewhat hasty:
The semiotic analysis of the adequacy or inadequacy of certain propositions in relation to
the contents which they represent is then ultimately based on a phenomenological analysis
of the speaker’s representational intentions. (1911, 17)
There is something speciﬁc to note about his arguments. His reasoning for the
claim that all positive existential propositions are analytic assumes that ‘being’ does
not connote anything (for it is not deﬁnable by means of a classic deﬁnition). On
the other hand, his justiﬁcation of the claim that negative propositions are false
assumes that ‘non-being’ connotes something. It is far from obvious that by negating
a predicate which does not connote something one can get a predicate connoting
something.
Arguably, for ‘non-being’ one cannot construct a classic deﬁnition either. For
consider:
A non-being is a B which is C.
We cannot ﬁnd B and C to make the above expression true, because (as Le´sniewski
himself seems to have believed), the truth of the claim that B is C in a deﬁnition
requires a B which is C to exist. A possible objection to this claim is this. It is possible
to take any two disjoint B and C in order to obtain such a deﬁnition. The problem
with this objection is that Le´sniewski used the notion of a classic deﬁnition: B has
to be a genus proximum and C has to be a differentia speciﬁca. That is, C has to be
included in B. Obviously this would be impossible had B and C been disjoint.
Le´sniewski appears to make two of the standard moves that were usually made
those days. (1) He suggested that the surface form of a statement does not have
to express its content adequately. (2) He used quantiﬁcational devices to express
existence.

2
Le´sniewski’s Early Philosophical Views
Although (1) seems to be a correct observation, Le´sniewski does not seem to have
been inﬂuenced by a similar strategy of Russell’s or Frege’s. Probably, the extent to
which he was acquainted with the western logical thought at that time did not exceed
a relatively simple formal theory given by Łukasiewicz in his book on the principle
of contradiction (Łukasiewicz 1910).
As to (2), it is unclear which part of Le´sniewski’s ‘Some object is S’ does the
heavy lifting of existential import. In his early work, Le´sniewski was unclear about
that. Later on, however, it was the copula ‘is’ that imported the existence rather than
the quantiﬁer.20
Le´sniewski’s general line is this. First, he introduced linguistic conventions and
agreed that they do not merely formalize our natural language intuitions. Rather, they
are, to some extent, supposed to replace intuitions whose reliability is undermined
by paradoxes. Then, he argued that given those conventions it follows that existential
propositions do not have certain properties we normally think they do (and that people
who share the normal intuitions are wrong). Next, he insisted that to preserve those
“normal” intuitions we have to use different sentences to express what we have in
mind.
It is not clear why Le´sniewski went through all the trouble of playing around with
the ‘unnatural’ reading and insisting that we should change our ways of expressing
existential statements in natural language. Perhaps a more viable option would be
to say that the logical structure of existential statements is not the one Le´sniewski
initially attributes to them, but rather the one he introduces to preserve our intuitions
aboutexistentialstatements.Thenotionofdeeplogicalstructureofanaturallanguage
sentence, it seems, was not available to Le´sniewski at that time, and this might
be one reason why he expressed his view as he did. On this re-interpretation, the
lengthy discussion of the unnatural reading might be seen as an argument against
that interpretation and for the more elaborate quantiﬁcational reading of existential
statements.
2.5 The Principle of Contradiction
In 1910, Łukasiewicz published a book titled On the Principle of Contradiction in
Aristotle (Łukasiewicz 1910a)21 His considerations of Aristotle’s position led him to
distinguishing at least three different principles: the logical principle of contradiction,
(2.24) For no p : p and not−p are true simultaneously.
the ontological principle of contradiction,
(2.25) No being may possess and not possess at the same time one and the same quality.
20 So, for example, it is a theorem of one of Le´sniewski’s systems that ∃a ¬ex(a), i.e. ‘For some

2.5 The Principle of Contradiction
29
and the doxastic principle of contradiction.
(2.26) It is not possible to believe in a contradiction.
He argued that (2.26) as a factual statement is false (although it may have some worth
as a methodological directive), and that Aristotle’s arguments for (2.24) and (2.25)
are not conclusive.
In his paper from 1912, Le´sniewski, against Łukasiewicz, attempted a proof of the
(ontological) principle of contradiction. The basic version in which he formulated
that principle was:
(2.27) No being can both possess and not possess one and the same property.
Which was also equivalently stated as:
(2.28) Every object is unable to both possess and not possess one and the same property.
(2.29) Every P is unable to both have and not have c.
The expression ‘both to possess and not to possess a property c’ Le´sniewski abbre-
viated as ‘to be a contradiction’. The expression ‘P is unable to be a contradiction’
was read by Le´sniewski as equivalent to a conjunction of two claims:
(2.30)
P is not a contradiction.
(2.31) The sentence ‘P is not a contradiction’ is true a priori.
where being true a priori, by convention (2.13), means being provable on the basis
of linguistic conventions only.
Le´sniewski’s argument for the Principle of Contradiction goes as follows:
(2.32) ‘Some object is a contradiction’ is a contradictory proposition.
By (2.11), ‘Some object is a contradiction’ does not possess a symbolic function
(because(2.11)saysthatnocontradictorypropositionpossessesasymbolicfunction).
However, it has (he claimed) a denoting subject and a connoting predicate. Therefore,
bytheconventionregardingthetruthandfalsehoodofcontradictingpropositionswith
denoting subjects and connoting predicates (2.10), the proposition:
(2.33) Every object is not a contradiction.
is true (because its contradictory proposition is false). Since the proof is based on lin-
guistic conventions only, the Principle of Contradiction is, according to Le´sniewski,
true a priori.
Clearly, in some reasonable sense of the word ‘proof’, what Le´sniewski gave was
a proof of the ontological Principle of Contradiction. Nevertheless, epistemically
speaking the proof is not extremely compelling. The conventions on which it is
based, especially the one which says that no contradictory proposition possesses a
symbolic function, seem to do the heavy lifting and to smuggle the conclusion in
already. If someone rejects the ontological Principle of Contradiction, they probably

Le´sniewski’s Early Philosophical Views
will not accept the claim that contradictory propositions do not have a symbolic
function.
Given that the argument is not too convincing, it is interesting to see how
Łukasiewicz reacted to Le´sniewski’s paper. Here is a passage from Łukasiewicz’s
entry in his diary from May 9, 194922:
I met Le´sniewski in Lvov in 1912. I lived then with my uncle in Chmielowski Street 10.
One afternoon someone rang at the entrance door. I opened the door and I saw a young man
with a light, sharp beard, a hat with a wide brim and a big black cockade instead of a tie.
The young man bowed and asked kindly: “Does Professor Łukasiewicz live here?”. I replied
that it was so. “Are you Professor Łukasiewicz?” asked the stranger. I replied that it was
so. “I am Le´sniewski, and I have come to show you the proofs of an article I have written
against you”. I invited the man into my room. It turned out that Le´sniewski was publishing
in Przegl¸ad Filozoﬁczny [Philosophical Review, RU] an article containing criticism of some
views of mine in the “Principle of Contradiction in Aristotle”. This criticism was written
with such scientiﬁc exactness, that I could not ﬁnd any points which I could take up with
him. I remember that when, after hours of discussion, Le´sniewski parted from me, I went
out as usual to the Kawiarnia Szkocka (Scottish Café), and I declared to my colleagues
waiting there that I would have to give up my logical interests. A ﬁrm had sprung up whose
competition I was not able to face.
2.6 The Principle of Excluded Middle
Le´sniewski (1913b) makes a distinction between two formulations of the Principle
of Excluded Middle (PEM). One refers to objects (the metaphysical PEM):
(2.34) Every object has to stand, with respect to every property, either in the relation of
possessing it or in the relation of not possessing it.
the second refers to propositions (logical PEM):
(2.35) At least one of two contradictory propositions has to be true.23
He clearly states that his rejection of PEM will be the rejection of the logical version.
He speaks of this version of PEM in not very favorable terms:
The logical principle of the excluded middle not only does not help to resolve ‘logical’
problems of various kinds, but it is in fact a dangerous theoretical obstacle which should be,
therefore, removed from science. (1913b, 47)
The argument against the logical version of PEM proceeds as follows. According
toconvention(2.9),foranatomicpropositionofthekind‘A is B’tobetrue,theremust

LesnieDoc.html#lukdiary
23 Although Le´sniewski did not give a deﬁnition of the contradictory of a sentence, from his
discussion it seems that this was a syntactic notion: if S is taken to be a singular term, the sentence
contradictory with ‘S is P’ would be ‘S is not P’, and if S is taken to be a general term, then the
sentence contradictory to ‘Some S is P’ is ‘Every S is not P’.

2.6 The Principle of Excluded Middle
31
be an object denoted by A, having all the properties connoted by B (recall that the
reading of ‘all properties’ is strong here, so: ‘all properties and at least one property’).
Hence, every atomic proposition whose subject does not denote anything is a false
proposition, and every proposition whose predicate does not connote anything is a
false proposition.
Thus, all contradictory sentences from the following pairs are false:
(2.36) Every centaur has a tail. Some centaur does not have a tail.
(2.37) Every square circle is a circle. Some square circle is not a circle.
(2.38) Pegasus is an animal. Pegasus is not an animal.
The ﬁrst two examples come from Le´sniewski, the last one does not.24 Since
these pairs are, according to Le´sniewski, pairs of contradictory propositions, they
are counterexamples to PEM.
Thus, Le´sniewski rejects the equivalence:
(2.39) (‘A is B’ is false) ≡(A is not B)25
Moreover, this account yields some speciﬁc examples of false analytic sentences:
(2.40) Every contradictory object is contradictory.
(2.41) A square circle is a circle.
Note that according to Le´sniewski, the proposition contradictory to ‘S is P’ is
‘S is not a P’, which is not equivalent to ‘It is not the case that S is P.’ To some
extent it allows one to think that his discussion is not a discussion of propositional
Principle of Excluded Middle proper, because the negation involved is different. Yet,
we will later see that the issues discussed in the 1914 paper will be important for his
24 “Let us suppose that I am to answer the question of whether the following propositions are
true: ‘every centaur has a tail’, ‘a certain centaur does not have a tail’, ‘every square circle is a
circle’, ‘a certain square circle is not a circle’. If we take into account the above analysis, the answer
to this question becomes quite easy. Each of the four mentioned propositions is obviously false
because the subject of each denotes nothing. The word ‘centaur’ which is the subject in the ﬁrst
two propositions, and the expression ‘square circle’ being the subject in the remaining two—denote
nothing because no object is a centaur and no object is a square circle. Thus, no object is such that it
could be denoted only by the word ‘centaur’ or by the expression ‘square circle’. These expressions
denote no objects, that is to say—they denote nothing.” (1913b, 59)
25 “The points raised …throw some light on the ‘problem’ of negative propositions. They demon-
strate the falsehood of the theory of negative propositions, developed in considerable detail by
Sigwart in his Logic and defended by some other modern logicians. According to this theory—the
negative proposition ‘A is not B’ is equivalent to the afﬁrmative proposition ‘the proposition ‘A is
B’ is false’…Given the propositions ‘the centaur has no tail’, ‘a square circle is not a circle’ …the
respective propositions …are ‘the proposition ‘the centaur has a tail’ is false’ and ‘the proposition
‘the square circle is a circle’ is false’. The propositions of the type ‘A is not B’ …are in this case
false because …they have subjects which denote nothing …For the same reason, the respective
propositions of the type ‘A is B’, i.e. ‘the centaur has a tail’, ‘a square circle is a circle’—are also
false. If, however, the last two propositions are false, then the propositions stating their falsehood
must be true.” (1913b, 59–60)

Le´sniewski’s Early Philosophical Views
logical development further on (for example, for Le´sniewski’s solution of Russell’s
paradox).
Also, Le´sniewski’s considerations allow us to see the difference between the
metaphysical PEM and the logical PEM. Le´sniewski’s rejection of logical PEM does
not undermine the metaphysical version. Le´sniewski still claimed that any existing
object either has or does not have a given property. The only case where he thought
the logical PEM might fail is when a subject of a sentence fails to denote.26
2.7 Eternity of Truth
Le´sniewski believed that any sentence that was true is and will be true, and that
any sentence that was false is and will be false. In this sense, he believed in the
eternity of truth. Most of his views on this issue can be found in a paper which he
wrote to criticize Tadeusz Kotarbi´nski, who believed that there are some sentences
which are neither true nor false and may become true or false with the ﬂow of
time. The whole discussion between Kotarbi´nski and Le´sniewski was seminal for
Łukasiewicz’s invention of three-valued logics. What Łukasiewicz rejected was the
claim that if a sentence is not true, it is false. Thus, he introduced a third value,
interpreted as ‘not yet determined’.27
Since Kotarbi´nski’s views are quite important for the development of many-
valued logics (his views inspired Łukasiewicz to construct his three-valued logic) and
Kotarbi´nski’s paper has never been translated from Polish, I will start with a lengthy
presentation of Kotarbi´nski’s views. Then I will turn to Le´sniewski’s criticism of
those views.
In (1913) Tadeusz Kotarbi´nski, a representative of the Lvov-Warsaw school,
published a paper titled “The problem of the existence of the future.” His main
claim is that propositions about future events not yet causally determined are neither
false nor true now. The arguments are rather unclear and the paper employs many
metaphors. The main gist, however, is that if propositions do not change their truth-
value through time, then all actions are predetermined and there is no free will (and
since we know we have free will, propositions change their truth-value through time).
Here is a sample of Kotarbi´nski’s style in that paper:
Truly one has said that what has gone away has never ceased to exist—it only came into
absence. What happened, truly happened; one who states that, states the truth, so this some-
26 Even though Le´sniewski rejected one of the forms of the PEM, he did not divide sentences into
true, false and indeterminate—according to him, if a PEM failure takes place, it is because both a
sentence and its negation are false. Gelber (2004) suggested that “on the basis of his interpretation
of Aristotle, for instance, Le´sniewski developed a three-valued classiﬁcation with true, false and
indeterminate as the values” (p. 231). This is not Le´sniewski’s view. The charitable reading of
Gelber is that Le´sniewski is there mistaken with Łukasiewicz).
27 The introduction of such a third value would invalidate Le´sniewski’s reasoning. There are some
other difﬁculties to Łukasiewicz account of futura contingentia, though. Alas, they lie beyond the
scope of this book.

2.7 Eternity of Truth

thing does exist. To change the past—this is a mad idea. To give somebody the world of
the past under his reign is to yield an enormous sphere of reality which he cannot reign. If
impossibilities are prone to gradation, it is more impossible to revert yesterday’s ﬂight of
a mosquito than to modify the moon’s trajectory tomorrow. What has happened cannot be
undone. But really, is it only true about the past? Is it only the past things and events which
are such and such, so that they cannot be not such and such, or is it also the things that are to
come that are already such and such and not different and they cannot come about as not such
and such? Is it also the case that also in the future there is something that cannot be undone,
because it has already happened? Many would ﬁrmly deny that. But after a consideration,
having understood the issue, they would equally ﬁrmly assert it. And a scientiﬁcally educated
man, with his eyes shut is eager to concede without a doubt that the whole future is such and
such, and even though nothing in it has happened, it nevertheless cannot be undone. What
is to come, allegedly differs from what has gone just like, for example, what happens now
behind us in space differs from what is happening in front of us …like a cloud above our heads
from another cloud above the Paciﬁc Ocean. [My translation of (Kotarbi´nski 1913: 74)].
Kotarbi´nski’s reasoning resembles the discussion in Aristotle’s Peri Hermeneias,
IX. The main line of the argument is this. Suppose it is true that p is a sentence true at
t′. Then it is now true that p is true at t′. But if that is the case, I cannot do anything to
change it, because it has already been ‘decided’ that p at t′ is to come. An analogous
reasoning seems to apply to false sentences. Suppose that p is a sentence false at t′.
Then, it is false that p is true at t′. But if it is already so, there is nothing we can do
to change it.
Speaking more in terms of Kotarbi´nski’s terminology, Kotarbi´nski identiﬁes being
an object of a true afﬁrmative judgment with existence (‘judgment’ is taken from
Kotarbi´nski’s terminology). He argues that if a judgement is true at some time t, then
it is true at any time later than t. It follows that whatever exists at some time t, exists
at any time later than t (i.e. never ceases to exist), and whatever does not exist now,
never comes to existence (for if what p states does not exist, then what not—p states
does exist and continues do to so).
This conclusion seems to him quite problematic. We usually believe that we can
create something: whether it is a result of our moral action, or a subject of our artistic
or intellectual activity. Since this (following his deﬁnition of existence) cannot be
the case (at least he so believes), if the propositions referring to those created objects
have already been true before the act of creation, he concludes that some propositions
referring to future freely created objects are neither true nor false.
This is just a guess about what the argument would have been like if Kotarbi´nski
formulated it more explicitly. Here is how he originally phrased his view (again, I
quote Kotarbi´nski at length since his work has not been translated):
Truly, an enormous majority of things to come, practically speaking, have more to do with
the past than with future things. The ﬂow of sea currents, earthquakes, volcano eruptions,
the rotations of heavenly bodies cannot be changed. We cannot make it true that golf stream
will ﬂow through Poland, that the tomorrow’s golf stream’s ﬂow is here. With this sort of
things we are powerless. No matter whether we leave them behind or whether they are in the
future. We have to reckon with those to come as well as with those that has passed. Those
things are such and such and their having those properties in the future exists even though
they are in the future …It is already a true judgment which asserts that an object which lives
will die in the future. My inherence, pictorially speaking, of the property of being dead is

34
2
Le´sniewski’s Early Philosophical Views
true already. But is my every position in the future equally existent? Is the fact that I will
die equally true as the fact that I will die at this speciﬁc time, and that this and no other
job I will have, that among two roads I will choose the one on the right and not the one on
the left, that in that speciﬁc moment such and such thought will cross my mind, raised by
my attention in that moment, that I will make a vow (or not), abide by it (or not)? Is this
also already true today and was it true centuries ago, or at least since my birth? No, never!
Those things are undecided, they are in our hands, under our reign, and the great practical
difference which divides everything in two spheres is not the present moment: it only crosses
the present moment at some places. Of course, on the other side of the river that ﬂows on
the border of our freedom, there remains the whole gigantic world of things that are ready to
come, which already have the truth to accompany them. The freedom ends where the truth
begins, not where the past comes into being. If I can do something, create it, it is not true
that it already is. For how can one create what is, what happened or what already is created?
One may, at most, create something similar, but not the very same thing. But neither what I
can create is false. For how can one come to being, if the judgment stating its existence is
false? If it came about (as created), we would have had a contradiction: a judgment about
it would have been true and false. Apparently, maybe not, but in fact—indeed. For we are
talking not about making something which is not present a future thing. We are not talking
about a microbe infecting a presently healthy man. We are not talking about covering a
canvas which is now white with paint. We do not need creativity (in our ontological sense)
for that; and this is what one has in mind when he denies intuitively the impossibility of
creating something when the corresponding judgment about it is false. Only when we truly
create, we create the truth…For, for something to truly come into being it is required that
before it does, the judgment stating it to be not true. This is the condition of creativity. On
the other hand, there is no creativity, if before that moment where the judgment is to begin
to be true, it is false. For what is false, cannot become true. If it is false that in the moment
t an object has a given feature, one cannot make it that this object has this feature at t, even
if t is a future moment. Otherwise—a contradiction. For if one can make this happen, then
the assertion of this achievement cannot contradict any true judgment, whereas from the
assertion of this achievement it follows that the assertion of what is achieved is true, that it
is true that the object has this feature in that moment, but the assumption says that it is false.
Contradiction. If anyone wanted to argue that the possibility of doing something does not
presuppose the existence of the result, but rather only that the result will exist, and that he
does not presuppose the truth of the corresponding judgment now, but rather that later, when
we perform the action, it will be true, one can answer what follows. If it is false that a given
object has a given feature right now, it will never be true, even when the action will have
been performed; moreover, it will still be false. So a certain judgment will be true and will
not be true (it will even be false), so—contradiction. For contradiction applies to the future,
present and past existence equally. So, one cannot leave tomorrow, if we know today that
who asserts this departure lies. [My translation of (Kotarbi´nski 1913: 79–80)]
The most striking feature of Kotarbi´nski’s view is that he identiﬁes truth with
necessity and falsehood with impossibility:
Every truth is a necessity, every falsehood—an impossibility. For what is, has to be, because
it cannot not be; if something is ready [i.e. already decided], but it is not, it cannot be, because
already the judgment stating it is false, so it cannot become a truth. One can memorize it
in a simpler way: a judgment is true if the thing is, and therefore when it is necessary, it is
false—if the thing is impossible and it contradicts something that is.28

2.7 Eternity of Truth
35
In response to Kotarbi´nski, Le´sniewski published a paper: “Is all truth only true
eternally or is it also true without a beginning?” (1913a). Le´sniewski begins with a
few minor points.
Le´sniewski on Kotarbi´nski’s Account of Existence
Kotarbi´nski’s at some point in his paper says:of existence:
(2.42) x exists if and only if x is an object such that an afﬁrmative judgment referring to it
is true.
Clearly, Kotarbi´nski’s approach differs from Le´sniewski’s. Le´sniewski deﬁned truth
in terms of the existence of an object named by the subject and the connotation of
the predicate. Kotarbi´nski on the other hand explains what it is to exist in terms of
truth.
(2.42) makes the notion of existence only as clear as our understanding of what
a judgment refers to. Indeed, this is the notion that Le´sniewski picks on. He adds a
few premisses of his own:
(2.43) Every afﬁrmative judgment asserts that an object possesses a property (that is, asserts
a relation of inherence).29
(2.44) Being an object to which a judgment refers is the same as being asserted by this
judgment.
and concludes:
(2.45) Only relations of inherence can exist.
This, as he says, contradicts Kotarbi´nski, who explicitly stated his own existence
(and obviously, Kotarbi´nski is not a relation of inherence).
This does not seem to be a very charitable reading of Kotarbi´nski, who probably
would not accept all these additional premises. True, Kotarbi´nski sometimes speaks
asifjudgmentsreferredtofacts(orrelationsofinherence)andsometimeshespeaksas
if judgments referred to common-sense objects. One option to read (2.42) charitably
is to take it to say that (at least for atomic judgments) a subject of a judgment refers
if its name is a subject in a true judgment and that the judgment is about this object.
Another is to say that a judgment refers both to the inherence relation and to the
object referred to by the subject. Either way, the objection is not compelling.
On What Has Gone by
Another Le´sniewski’s argument relies on intuitions he has about what exists. Oppos-
ing Kotarbi´nski’s claim that what is gone by has not ceased to exists, Le´sniewski
(without giving any deﬁnition or argument) deploys the intuition that a relation of
(Footnote 28 continued)
jest, gdy rzecz jest, a wi¸ec gdy jest konieczna, fałszywy—gdy niemo˙zliwa, sprzeczna z czym´s, co
jest.” (Kotarbi´nski 1913: 88–89)
29 The word comes from Latin in-(English: in) and -haerere (English: to hang, to stick). The relation
of inherence is the relation between a property and an object that has it.

36
2
Le´sniewski’s Early Philosophical Views
inherence exists at t if and only if it actually takes place at t. He then insists that a
relation which has gone by (i.e. ceased to take place) no longer exists.
This also is not a lethal objection. Kotarbi´nski himself mentions at least two
different notions of existence:
Simply, the term in use is ambiguous. In one sense (which we will use) every object about
which an afﬁrmative judgment stating it is true, and vice versa: a judgment stating its object
is true if the object exists …in the other sense, the more colloquial one, only the present
things exist, the past things existed and the future things will exist. (Kotarbi´nski 1913: 75)
and the objection stems from their conﬂation.
Objects with No Judgments
Le´sniewski’s another objection to (2.42) is that an object can exist without a judg-
ment referring to it being true. This is supported by a nominalistic interpretation
of Kotarbi´nski’s notion of a judgment: it is possible that an object exists while no
sentence-token referring to it exists. The impression one can get is that Kotarbi´nski
and Le´sniewski are talking past each other using different notions of a judgement.
Le´sniewski’s Notion of Eternal Truth
Le´sniewski points out that is unlikely that there are eternally existing tokens: inscrip-
tions, utterances etc. However, to be able to speak of eternal truths, he suggests a more
charitable sense of ‘being an eternal truth’ on which ‘being true’ means ‘being true
if uttered’. In this sense, Le´sniewski claims that all true sentences are true eternally.
One wonders why Le´sniewski himself didn’t employ this interpretation when
criticizing Kotarbi´nski by saying that an object can exist without any true sentence
token about it.
Another point is that (as we shall later see) Le´sniewski was an extensionalist
(among other things, he believed that the only connectives used in logic should be
truth-functional). That being the case, it is hard to see how conditionalizing and
saying ’true if uttered’ helps, if the ’if’ there is interpreted as material implication.
For suppose no tokens of a certain type of sentence p and its negation are uttered.
Then ‘if p is uttered, it is true’ and ‘if ¬p is uttered, it is true’ both come out vacuously
true, and so both p and ¬p are eternally true.
Le´sniewski: What is True Will Always be True
Let us move to Le´sniewski’s main argument:
(2.46) Suppose some judgement ‘A is B’ which is now true, will be false.
Therefore:
(2.47) At some time t later than now, ’A is B’ is not true.
But:
(2.48) Since ‘A is B’ is not true at t, ‘A is not B’ is true at t.
This, Le´sniewski claims, constitutes a contradiction:

2.7 Eternity of Truth
37
(2.49) “This assumption leads then to the conclusion that the judgment‘A is not B’, which
contradicts the judgment ‘A is B’ true at the present time, becomes true at time t. An
obstacle to the acceptance of the above conclusion is presented by the logical principle of
contradiction which says that if one of two contradictory judgments is true, then the other
must be false. Thus, if the judgment ‘A is B’ is true at the present time, we must conclude
that the contradictory judgment ‘A is not B’ is always thus also at time t, false.” (1913a,
97–98)
A possible response (discussed by Le´sniewski) is to say that if t is some later
time, ‘A is B’ can be true now and false at t, because A can cease to be B some
time between now and t.30 To avoid this difﬁculty, Le´sniewski insists that an atomic
sentence with a predicate with no rigid time reference can express different claims
at different times.
For instance, ‘Stanisław Le´sniewski will die’ uttered in 1913 expresses the state-
ment that at some time later than the time of utterance Le´sniewski will cease to exist.
The claim is true in 1913. If it is uttered after his death, it states the existence of
a different relation of inherence. The former judgment is true, the latter is not (if
Le´sniewski does not exist, he can bear the relation of inherence to anything). So,
Le´sniewski focused on sentences whose subjects denote and predicates connote the
same independently of the context (especially time) of utterance.
…if in any of the above judgments I substitute for the expressions whose meaning varies with
time or circumstances such expressions whose semantic function is (for the given system of
linguistic symbols) constant, I will immediately encounter truths which are eternally true.
If, e.g., instead of judgments: ‘Stanisław Le´sniewski will die’ or ‘Stanisław Le´sniewski will
cease to be alive’ I formulate the judgment: ‘Stanisław Le´sniewski possesses the property
of having ceased to be alive in the future of 2 p.m., March 2nd, 1913’, then this judgment
will be always true.” (1913a, 98–99)
Indeed, we may safely assume that both Kotarbi´nski and Le´sniewski did not discuss
the eternity of truth of context- (especially tense-) sensitive sentences, ant that the
problem they focused on was rather whether those full-blown, precise sentences can
change their truth values.
With this in mind, let us try to run Le´sniewski’s argument without tense-sensitive
predicates and with a particular example of a sentence. Suppose ‘Le´sniewski is alive’
is uttered (and true) at time t1 (say, in 1913). Uttered at t1 it expresses the judgment:
‘Le´sniewski is alive at t1.’ Suppose further that this judgment is false at some later
time t2 (say in 1940). This means that at t2 it is false that ‘Le´sniewski is alive at t1’.
But then, at t2 it is true that ‘Le´sniewski is not alive at t1’.
Now, why would this be a contradiction? Recall that Le´sniewski explicitly says
that he relies on “the logical principle of contradiction which says that if one of two
30 “One might say that my proof would be quite valid but for the fault that it does not ‘accord with
reality’. To support this objection one might cite a ‘random’, it seems, judgment which is originally
true and then ceases to be true, e.g., the judgment ‘Stanisław Le´sniewski will die’. This judgment
is true for as long as I am alive; when I die it will become false because, when I shall not be here
anymore, I shall not be able to die again. By becoming false at the time of my death, the judgment
‘Stanisław Le´sniewski will die’ will give way to the true judgment ‘Stanisław Le´sniewski died’
which in its turn is false until I shall die.” (1913a, 97–98)

38
2
Le´sniewski’s Early Philosophical Views
contradictory judgments is true, then the other must be false. Thus, if the judgment
‘A is B’ is true at the present time, we must conclude that the contradictory judgment
‘A is not B’ is always […] false.” (1913a, 97–98) Applied to our case, this entails
that if ‘Le´sniewski is alive at t1’ is true at t1, ‘Le´sniewski is not alive at t1’ is false at
t1, and therefore always false, also at t2. But then ‘Le´sniewski is alive at t1’ is true at
t2, which contradicts the assumption.
Le´sniewski: What is True, Always was True
Le´sniewski’s argument for the claim that all truth is true without a beginning is very
similar.
(2.50) Suppose some judgement ‘A is B’ which is now true, was false.
Hence:
(2.51) At some time t earlier than now, ‘A is B’ was not true.
But:
(2.52) Since ‘A is B’ is not true at t, ‘A is not B’ is true at t.
And again, Le´sniewski says:
(2.53) …on the basis of the law of contradiction—since the judgment ‘A is B’ is true at
present, its contradiction ‘A is not B’ is always false, and so it was at time t”. (1913a, 103)
Assessment
Both Le´sniewski’s arguments rely on (at least) two assumptions. The principle of
excluded middle (if a sentence is not true at t, then its negation is true at t), and an
unusual version of the principle of contradiction which says that if ‘A is B’ is true
at present, its contradiction ‘A is not B’ is always false.
One might object that the principle of excluded middle has been rejected by
Le´sniewski himself in his earlier paper. This is not a strong objection, because
Le´sniewski still claimed the principle is valid for sentences without empty or non-
connoting names.
A more serious problem was that Le´sniewski used a very unusual version of the
principle of contradiction. Let us even put aside the fact that it differs from his own
formulation from his paper on this principle. What is more worrying is that the eternal
aspect of truth, which is not present in standard formulations of this principle, is built
into it. What the principle of contradiction validates is the passage from:
‘Le´sniewski is alive at t1’ is true at t1.
to
(2.54) ‘Le´sniewski is not alive at t1’ is false at t1.

2.7 Eternity of Truth
39
Alas, the claim that (2.54) entails that ‘Le´sniewski is not alive at t1’ is always false
and therefore also at t2 is neither normally built into the principle of contradiction,
nor an assumption that Kotarbi´nski would endorse.
Le´sniewski in his alleged application of the principle of contradiction actually
performs two steps. The ﬁrst one is the actual application of the original principle,
and the second one assumes that iterated applications of temporally indexed truth
attributions do not matter. That is, that once we have a sentence ‘A is B at t1’, adding
or removing ‘is true at t2’ to it does not change the truth-value of the sentence. But
this is exactly what Kotarbi´nski contested.
2.8 Paradoxes
In the course of discussing the issues described above, Le´sniewski approached a few
paradoxes. Three of them (Nelson-Grelling’s, Meinong’s and Epimenides’) were dis-
cussed in passing in papers concerned mainly with something else, whereas Russell’s
paradox was discussed speciﬁcally in 1914a and 1927.
2.8.1 The Nelson-Grelling Paradox
The paradox31 consists in asking ‘Does a man who kills all and only people who do
not commit a suicide kill himself?’ and reasoning: If he kills himself, then he is not
among the people who do not commit a suicide, so he does not kill himself. If he
does not kill himself, then he is among the people who do not commit a suicide, and
thus he kills himself.
Le´sniewski’s answer in (1913b, 74–77) was that both: ‘He kills himself.’ and ‘He
does not kill himself.’ are false, because there is no object which is a man who kills all
and only people who do not commit a suicide. If there was such an object, this object
would be contradictory. (Le´sniewski’s considerations pertaining to the principle of
excluded middle are relevant here. It is exactly because the subject is empty why
both sentences can be false.)
2.8.2 Meinong’s Paradox
Meinong put forward the claim that whenever a judgement is being made, there is
something about which this judgement is being made. Here is how he puts it:
That knowing is impossible without something being known, and more generally, that judg-
ments and ideas or presentations are impossible without being judgments about and presen-
tations of something, is revealed to be self-evident by a quite elementary examination of
these experiences. (Meinong 1960, 76)
31 Grelling’s paradox is sometimes associated with quite a different reasoning pertaining to hetero-
logicality. However, ‘Nelson-Grelling paradox’ is a term which Le´sniewski originally used. Indeed,
this is similar to a formulation to be found in Grelling and Nelson (1908).

40

Le´sniewski’s Early Philosophical Views
This also pertains to negative existential statements, which claim that something does
not exist:
…it is even more instructive to recall this trivial fact, which does not yet go beyond the realm
of the Seinsobjektiv: Any particular thing that is not real must at least be capable of serving
as the Object for those judgments which grasp its Nichtsein. It does not matter whether this
Nichtsein is necessary or merely factual; nor does it matter in the ﬁrst case whether the
necessity stems from the essence of the Object or whether it stems from aspects which are
external to the Object in question. In order to know that there is no round square, I must
make a judgment about the round square…Those who like paradoxical modes of expression
could very well say: “There are objects of which it is true that there are no such objects”.
(Meinong 1960, 82–83)
Speciﬁcally, Meinong seems to have been committed also to ‘Some objects are
contradictory’. Le´sniewski gave what he thought to be a generalized version of
Meinong’s argument for this claim. Here it is.
Either it is true that there are no contradictory objects, or it is false that there are
no contradictory objects. If the latter is the case, we easily get to the conclusion that
some objects are contradictory. Suppose the former:
(2.55) There are no contradictory objects.
This seems to imply (at least on the Meinongian view):
(2.56) A contradictory object is not an object.
But ‘a contradictory object is not an object’ is true only if a certain object is contra-
dictory. Thus we have:
(2.57) Some object is contradictory.
The point of this paradox is that to deny the existence of contradictory objects one
has to truly predicate something about them. True predication requires the existence
of the objects of which something is predicated, and thus to be able to say truly
about contradictory objects that they do not exist one has to assume that there are
contradictory objects.32
Le´sniewski argues that there is a simple response to the above reasoning. First,
in the Le´sniewskian framework, the proposition ‘A contradictory object is not an
object’ is false, because its subject does not denote anything (recall that afﬁrmative
sentences with empty subjects were for Le´sniewski false). Yet, it is true that there are
no contradictory objects. Hence, (2.56) (which Le´sniewski takes to be false) is not
32 “…if it were true that there are no ‘contradictory objects’, in other words, no objects are contra-
dictory, then it would be true that ‘a contradictory object is not an object’. It can be, however, true
that ‘a contradictory object’ is not an object only in the case when a certain object is ‘contradic-
tory’. If no object were ‘contradictory’, then no proposition about the ‘contradictory object’ could
be true, including the proposition ‘a contradictory object is not an object’. Thus, if it were true: ‘a
contradictory object is not an object’, then it must be also true that a certain object is contradictory.
This being so, the assumption made at the beginning that no object is ‘contradictory’ entails the
conclusion that a certain object is ‘contradictory’.” (1913b, 62–63)

2.8 Paradoxes
41
just a reformulation of (2.55) (which he takes to be true) and does not follow from it
(because no false sentence follows from a true one).
Following Le´sniewski’s remarks on existential propositions, the non-existence of
contradictory objects should be rather parsed as:
(2.58) No object is contradictory.
which is true and does not imply the existence of any contradictory object, in contrast
to (2.55) or (2.56).
2.8.3 Epimenides’ Paradox (Liar)
The paradox, in Le´sniewski’s formulation, consists in the following reasoning. Sup-
pose that Epimenides during the time between t1 and t2 utters exactly one sentence:
(2.59) The sentence asserted by Epimenides at time t1– t2 is false.
Is this sentence, as uttered by Epimenides, true or false? Suppose it is false. Then,
what is stated in this sentence does not take place. Hence, it is not the case that the
sentence uttered by Epimenides at time t1– t2 is false (for this is what the sentence
states). But, if it is not false, it is true.
Suppose it is true. Then, what is stated in this sentence takes place. So it is the
case that the sentence uttered by Epimenides at time t1– t2 is false.
Le´sniewski’s solution to this paradox makes use of (2.14), which is a somewhat
artiﬁcial restriction on what names can refer to (namely, that they cannot refer to
expressions whose parts they are), and the following claims:
(2.60) Sentences, understood as inscriptions or sounds, are the proper truth bearers.
(2.61) All afﬁrmative categorical sentences with non-denoting subjects are false.
Consider the expression ‘The sentence asserted by Epimenides at time t1– t2’ as
uttered by Epimenides at time t1– t2 (as it occurred in the sentence which he uttered).
Does it denote at all? Following Le´sniewski’s convention regarding the denotation
of connoting expressions, it denotes all and only those sentence tokens asserted by
Epimenides at time t1– t2, which have no common part with the expression ‘the
sentence asserted by Epimenides at time t1– t2’ as uttered by Epimenides in t1– t2.
But there is no such a sentence. Therefore, this noun phrase does not denote anything.
Knowing that the subject of Epimenides’ sentence does not have a denotation,
Le´sniewski could truly say in 1913:
(2.62) The sentence asserted by Epimenides at time t1– t2 is false.
It is an expression equiform to that uttered by Epimenides. Nevertheless, it was true,
while the one uttered by Epimenides was false. Why?
Consider the subject of the sentence uttered by Le´sniewski: ‘The sentence asserted
by Epimenides at time t1– t2’. The sentence actually asserted by Epimenides has all

42
2
Le´sniewski’s Early Philosophical Views
propertiesconnotedbythissubject,anddoesnothaveanyexpression(numerically)in
commonwiththissubject.ThereforethesubjectofthesentenceutteredbyLe´sniewski
denotes the sentence uttered by Epimenides. Moreover, since the sentence uttered
by Epimenides does not have a denoting subject, it is true (when uttered by someone
else than Epimenides, or by Epimenides but not at t1– t2) that it is false.
Note also that from the fact that the sentence uttered by Epimenides is false it
does not follow that it is true, because its subject does not refer to this sentence itself,
and because the principle of excluded middle fails for sentences with non-denoting
subjects.
There are some interesting aspects of this solution. First of all, it seems to be one
of the very ﬁrst (in modern logic) applications of some sort of a restriction excluding
self-reference to the Liar paradox.
Second, it assumes that truth-value ascription is token-based. Two tokens of the
same sentence (type) which do not contain any indexical expressions, uttered at two
distinct occasions can have different truth-values.
Third, quite a few approaches to some paradoxes consist in claiming paradoxi-
cal sentences to be meaningless or devoid of truth-value. In contrast, Le´sniewski’s
approach makes them false, without making their negations true (and that is where
he employs his rejection of the principle of excluded middle).
Fourth, this solution does not save us from some versions of the liar paradox.
(2.14) is too weak. Indeed, assume that no name names an expression of which it is
a part. This does not undermine for example the following formulation:
(2.63) Sentence (2.64) is true.
(2.64) Sentence (2.63) is false.
No name in (2.63 and 2.64) names an expression of which it is a part. Still, a
contradiction is derivable if we assume that every sentence is either true or false.
Perhaps, a stronger assumption should have been taken to avoid the liar. Say, some-
thing like ‘No circularity in naming should take place’, that is, if we start with a
given name, say m0, then there are no expressions m1, . . . , mk such that mi names
a part of mi+1 and mk = m0.
One worry about this sort of approach is that it is pretty strong and it seems to
restrain us from considering some sentences which seem quite innocently true. This
is a general problem with many solutions to the Liar paradox, and it is not clear
whether any solution to the Liar can be given that does not violate some of our
intuitions.33,34 Overall, Le´sniewski’s approach is of the same type as (and predates)
33 See for instance Simmons (1993) for a critical survey.
34 Another problem is that this does not provide a way out of the Yablo’s paradox. Consider an
inﬁnite sequence of sentences s0, s1, s2, . . . such that:
s0 = ‘∀x (P1(x) →¬Tr(x))′,
(2.65)
s1 = ‘∀x (P2(x) →¬Tr(x))′,
s2 = ‘∀x (P3(x) →¬Tr(x))′, . . .

2.8 Paradoxes
43
Tarskian approach to natural language and paradoxes, and shares its virtues and
vices.35
2.8.4 Russell’s Paradox
Le´sniewski’s approach to Russell’s paradox is quite speciﬁc. As he addresses the
problem in (1914a) he applies pretty much the same strategy which he applied in
his earlier papers. He introduces his own understanding of certain notions and then
argues that when they are taken in this sense the solution is such-and-such. When he
discusses Russell’s paradox, he does preserve its verbal formulation. But as he goes
on explaining how his solution is supposed to work, it becomes more and more clear
that what he means by ‘class’ is not what Frege or Russell had in mind.
While Frege’s and Russell’s notion of a class is closely related to the notion of
set as it is employed in standard set theories (like Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory),
Le´sniewski’s notion stems from intuitions about parthood relation. In Le´sniewski’s
sense,aclassofcertainobjectsisjustonebiggerobjectwhosethoseformerobjectsare
all parts of. So, he approaches Russell’s paradox from the mereological (meros mean-
ing part in Greek) perspective.36 To see this clearly we need to follow Le´sniewski’s
reasoning for a while.
As phrased by Le´sniewski, the paradox assumes that one of the following sen-
tences is true:
(2.66) The class of classes not subordinated to themselves is subordinated to itself.
(2.67) The class of classes not subordinated to themselves is not subordinated to itself.
where by ‘subordinated to’ Le´sniewski means ‘being an element of’. Next, standard
paradoxical reasoning indicates that each of the above sentences implies the other,
thus yielding a contradiction. If such a class is not subordinated to itself, it belongs
to the class of of classes not subordinated to themselves, that is, to itself. If it is
(Footnote 34 continued)
Assume that the extension of every Pn, for n = 1, 2, 3, . . ., is sn, sn+1, sn+2, . . .. So every si says
that all s j’s with j > i are not true. Now ask yourself: is s0 true? If yes, then for any k > 0 the
sentence sk is false. But this also means that for any k > 1 the sentence sk is false. But this is exactly
what s1 says and hence s1 is true, which falsiﬁes s0. Suppose then that s0 is false. This means that
there is a k > 0 such that sk is true. But we can repeat the reasoning we led about s0, this time
about this sk to show that sk can’t be true. Hence the paradox. However, no circularity in reference
in Le´sniewski’s sense takes place: the subject of each sentence refers to all sentences below it. The
question whether circularity is involved is sensitive to the notion of circularity involved. See for
instance Leitgeb (2002) and Urbaniak (2009a).
35 See Betti (2004a) for a historical discussion of the relation between Le´sniewski’s and Tarski’s
approach to the Liar. See for instance Soames (1999) for a more in-depth discussion of the Tarskian
approach.
36 This move will be discussed in detail in Chap.5. Problems with Le´sniewski’s solution to Russell’s
paradox will be also discussed later on (Chap.7). Here I just focus on presenting the solution from
his early writings.

44

Le´sniewski’s Early Philosophical Views
subordinated to itself, it does not posses the property which all its members are
supposed to have, and therefore is not subordinated to itself.
Le´sniewski, referring to his discussion of the principle of excluded middle, points
out that if no object is the class of classes not subordinated to themselves, then both
(2.66) and (2.67) are plainly false, without implying a contradiction.
Before we look at the main assumptions of Le´sniewski’s argument, let us see
how he used variables. For the needs at hand it is enough to think about variables
substitutionally. The substitution class contains all possible countable noun phrases.
The difference between capital and lower case name variables is not essential. When
Le´sniewski wants to emphasize that the satisfaction of a formula requires that an
individual name be substituted for a variable, he uses a capital letter. Since this was
not a part of his ofﬁcial notation, I will use this convention in informal considerations,
but dispose of it once I move to Le´sniewski’s formal systems.
So, for instance, ‘an object P is subordinated to a class K iff for some a …’ does
not contain variables of three different sorts, but rather three different variables of
one and the same type. Moreover, Le´sniewski did not introduce a separate sort of
variables for classes. He just used P and K to keep track of what variable stands for
what (P is the ﬁrst letter of ‘przedmiot’—‘object’ in Polish, and K is the ﬁrst letter
of ‘klasa’—‘class’).
If there is no empty set, it is enough to show that no object is the class of classes
not subordinated to themselves in order to conclude that Russell’s class does not
exist. This is the strategy that Le´sniewski employs.
The basic notion used in Le´sniewski’s early solution to Russell’s paradox (1914a)
is ‘the class of object(s) n’ (we will use ‘Kl(n)’ in symbols), where n is a noun
phrase. His assumptions governing this notion are as follows:
(2.68) There is no empty class.
Presumably, the intuition here is that a class is a mereological whole composed
of those objects which are its parts (we also say, their mereological fusion). Since
every object is its own part (in this sense),37 there is no object devoid of parts. That
is, there can be no mereological fusion if there is nothing to fuse.
(2.69)
Kl(Kl(n)) = Kl(n)
Again, the underlying intuitions are mereological. If you fuse a bunch of objects,
then the fusion of that fusion is just one and the same object. A pile of a pile of stones
(if we admit piling single objects) is just the same pile of stones.
(2.70) Every atomic sentence with an empty subject is false.
This stems from convention (2.9). For an atomic sentence to be true, the object
denoted by the subject has to have the properties connoted by the predicate. If the
object does not denote any object, this condition is not satisﬁed and the sentence is
false.
37 This notion of parthood differs from the notion of proper parthood which requires the part to be
“smaller” than the object of which it is a part.

2.8 Paradoxes
45
(2.71) The universe of existing objects is the class of all objects which are not the universe.
This relies on the intuition that there is nothing more to the universe than all the
objects that exist in it: fuse all objects and you have the universe.
Another notion Le´sniewski uses is ‘subordination’ (nowadays, we would say
‘being an element’). He considers three ways of deﬁning it and insists that these are
the only three options:
(2.72) An object P is subordinated to a class K iff for some a (‘for some substitution of a
possible countable noun phrase’) the following two conditions are fulﬁlled: (1) K is a class
of objects a, (2) P is (an) a (or: P is one of the as).
(2.73) An object P is subordinated to a class K iff for every a the following two conditions
are fulﬁlled: (1) K is a class of objects a,38 (b) P is a.
(2.74) An object P is subordinated to a class K iff for every a: K is a class of objects a iff
P is a.
Le´sniewskistartswithrejectingoptions(2.73)and(2.74)fromtheabovetrilemma.
Rejecting (2.73)
Suppose that (2.73) works. Take a to stand for ‘a square circle’. For no P it is true that
P is a square circle. Therefore, there is a name (‘a square circle’) which, substituted
for a always falsiﬁes both conditions formulated in (2.73).
The ﬁrst condition is falsiﬁed because on Le´sniewski’s view there is no empty
class and the class of square circles would have to be empty (and simple sentences
with empty subjects are false).
The second condition is false because nothing is a square circle. Thus, for any P
and K it is not the case that for every name a: K is the class of objects a and P is a.
Thus, on this deﬁnition, no object is subordinated to any class.
(Come to think of it, (2.73) is quite absurd to start with. For if K is to be a class
of any objects, (2.73) requires it to be the class of a’s for any a. Among other things,
this would mean that K would have to be both the class of elephants and the class
of things which are not elephants.)
Rejecting (2.74)
Suppose (2.74) is true and an object P is subordinated to a class K. Take:
(2.75) a means ‘P or not P’.
Clearly:
38 I translate using the indeﬁnite article: ‘a class of objects’, because the assumption is not taken to
imply the uniqueness of a class of objects a.

46
2
Le´sniewski’s Early Philosophical Views
(2.76) For any object Q, Q is P or not P.
Thus:
(2.77)
P
is a.
is obviously fulﬁlled.
Now, recall we use the deﬁnition on which:
K is a class of objects a iff P is a.
Since every object is a (on our ﬁxed reading of a), K (the class of objects a) is the
universal class:
(2.78)
K = Kl(a) is the universal class.
By (2.69) we get:
(2.79)
K = Kl(Kl(a))
(2.74) also entails:
(2.80)
K is a class of the universal class iff P is the universal class.
(just substitute ‘the universal class’ for a).
(2.79) tells us that K is a class of the universal class, so we get the right-hand side
of (2.80):
(2.81)
P is the universal class.
On the other hand, replace a from the formulation of (2.74) by ‘an object which
is not the universal class’:
(2.82)
K is a class of the objects which are not the universal class iff P is an object which
is not the universal class.
Then (since, by (2.71), the universal class is the class of objects which are not the
universe) again:
(2.83)
Kl(the objects which are not the universal class) is the universal class
Since from (2.78) we already know that K is the universal class, we can conclude
that the ﬁrst condition from the formulation of (2.74) is satisﬁed. Hence, we also
have the other one:
(2.84)
P is an object which is not the universal clas.
which contradicts (2.81).
Since the above argument (which follows Le´sniewski closely) is somewhat cum-
bersome, let us take a look at another, less Le´sniewskian formulation. (2.74) tells us
that for any a:
K is a class of objects a (K = Kl(a)) iff P is a.

2.8 Paradoxes
47
This allows us to take (2.85), (2.86) and (2.87) as assumptions. Let us proceed with
the proof. (‘b or non-b’ is a complex noun phrase naming all objects which are either
b or not b (that is, all objects), ‘V ’ stands for ‘the universal class’, and ‘non-V ’ is a
name which names all things which are not the universal class.)

Contradiction: (2.96), (2.99).
Dealing with (2.72)
Given Le´sniewski’s assumptions, the only remaining possibility is (2.72). This for-
mulation has two interesting consequences:
(2.100)
Every object n is subordinated to Kl(n).
(2.101)
Not every object subordinated to Kl(n) is an n.
The ﬁrst claim is quite simple. For an object n to belong to Kl(n) it is enough that
for some a, n is a and Kl(n) is Kl(a). This, however, is witnessed by n itself, for n
is n and Kl(n) is Kl(n). (The latter claim is not logically trivial, for on Le´sniewski’s
view, for Kl(n) to exist, n has to exist.)
The second claim, which at ﬁrst seems unusual, can serve as an example of how
‘being subordinated to’ is (tacitly, at this point) connected with ‘being a part’.
Consider a sphere Q. As Le´sniewski says, the class of (all) halves of the sphere
Q is the sphere Q itself. The sphere Q is also the class of (all) quadrants of Q. Thus,

48
2
Le´sniewski’s Early Philosophical Views
we have the conclusion that any half of Q is subordinated to the class of quadrants
of Q. It is a general point to which we will get back when discussing Le´sniewski’s
understanding of class (Sect.5.1). Given two names such that the whole constituted
by all objects denoted by the ﬁrst is also the whole constituted by all objects denoted
by the second, any object denoted by the ﬁrst name is subordinated to the class of
objects denoted by the second name, even if no object denoted by the ﬁrst name is
denoted by the second name.
Now we are ready to give the argument for the main thesis, saying that every
class is subordinated to itself. Deﬁne ‘∪’ as a name-forming operator deﬁned by:
P is (Q ∪R) iff (P is Q) ∨(P is R). We will show that if K is Kl(n) for some n,
then K is subordinated to itself.39

(2.110)
(2.112)
K is subordinated to itself
(2.109), (2.111)
This completes Le´sniewski’s early solution to Russell’s paradox. If every class is
subordinated to itself, then no class is not subordinated to itself. So the class of classes
not subordinated to itself would be empty. But (Le´sniewski insists) there is no empty
class. Therefore, the class of classes not subordinated to itself does not exist. That
being the case, both ‘the class of classes not subordinated to itself is subordinated to
itself’ and ‘the class of classes not subordinated to itself is not subordinated to itself’
are false. (Since the subject is empty, the principle of excluded middle fails.)
One objection which Le´sniewski put forward against the standard formulation of
Russell’s paradox was that the inference from:
K is subordinated to the class of classes which are not subordinated to themselves.
to:
K is not subordinated to itself.
39 This is a streamlined version of Le´sniewski’s argument, the original is less accessible.

2.8 Paradoxes

is invalid. In fact, if we assume the mereological account of classes, we think of the
class of objects P as a whole consisting of all of P’s parts. Moreover, as we will
later explain in more detail (in Chap.5), being an element of (or being subordinated
to) this class does not force an object to be a P itself. It may as well be a part of a P
or a whole consisting of a few of P’s or a whole consisting of some parts of some
P’s.
For example, consider a herd of ten cows: a1, a2, a3, . . . , a10. Let us use the
name ‘cow α’ as a name which can be truly predicated only of our cows. Now,
‘Kl(cow(α))’ is a name of the mereological fusion of our cows. Being an element
of a herd is, following Le´sniewski, the same as being a part of it. But in this sense,
not only our cows are subordinated to this class. Among parts of the fusion are also
cow halves, legs, heads, pairs of cows etc. Clearly, being subordinated to the class
Kl(cow(α)) does not imply being a cow.
Note that assumption (2.71), used in Le´sniewski’s rejection of (2.74), also shows
some predilections towards the mereological understanding of the class. For take the
name ‘all objects that are not the universal class’. The class of all objects that are not
the universal class on the distributive (non-mereological) reading is not the universal
class. For there is some object which (by (2.74), which seems to mirror distributive
intuitions adequately) is not its element (namely, the universal class).
On the other hand, on the mereological reading the class of a is the mereological
fusion of all objects a. This being the case, in some sense, the universal class is
nothing over and above the fusion of all other objects in the world. The universal
class is a part of the fusion of all objects that are not the universal class.
Le´sniewski returned to this paradox after developing his logical systems. A classic
discussion of this formal treatment is to be found in Soboci´nski (1949b). Problems
with this approach are discussed in Urbaniak (2008a). I will also discuss this approach
later, in Chap.7.
2.9 On Universals
Le´sniewski devoted some space to the rejection of the existence of abstract objects
(1913b, 50–53). This reasoning starts with a tentative deﬁnition of a general object:
(2.113)
A is general with respect to a group of objects iff it possesses only those properties
which are common to all those objects.
For instance, the universal ‘man’ cannot have any properties common only to a
few men, but rather it has to have only those properties that all of them have. The
argument now proceeds as follows.
Suppose there is an object Pk which is general with respect to individuals
P′
1, P′
2, . . . , P′
n. For every individual object P′
i one can always ﬁnd certain prop-
erty ci which is not common to all individual objects P′
1, P′
2, . . . , P′
n. For instance,
the property of being identical with P′
i . So, Pk does not possess the property ci.

50
2
Le´sniewski’s Early Philosophical Views
Moreover, the individual object P′
i does not possess the property of not possessing
the property ci. Hence, the general object Pk does not possess the property of not
possessing the property ci (because, on the currently entertained deﬁnition, a gen-
eral object cannot possess any property which an object that falls under it does not
have). But then, Pk possesses the property ci. Thus, any general (universal) object is
contradictory.
The argument is not extremely convincing. The anti-nominalist can simply rely on
a different account of universals. For instance, one may make a distinction between
the properties of the universal itself (like: being universal, being immaterial, being
abstract etc.) and the content of the universal. The universal ‘man’ can be said to be
abstract whereas no individual man is an abstract object. Introducing the notion of
content to the account of universals seems to refute Le´sniewski’s objection. Sure,
if an object does not have the property of not possessing the property ci, then it
possesses the property ci itself. But it is doubtful that if the property of not possessing
the property ci is not in the content of a universal, then the property of ci is in its
content. With respect to a given content properties are not divided in two groups:
those, which belong to the content, and those, whose negated properties belong to
the content. Rather, they divide in three groups: those which belong to the content,
those the negated properties of which belong to the content, and those which are
not ‘decided’ by the content (that is properties such that neither themselves nor their
negated properties belong to the content).
Gryganiec(2000)suggestsanotherreasontotreatthedeﬁnitionusedbyLe´sniewski
as inadequate. Here is how he formulates his argument:
The incorrectness of the deﬁnition of the object Op can be also shown in a different way.
Suppose there are two individual objects P1 and P2. Assume moreover that the ﬁrst one,
that is P1, possesses n properties, whereas the second one—P2—n + m properties. We do
not decide here whether symbols n and m denote ﬁnite or inﬁnite sets of properties; we only
know that those sets exhaust the ontic furnishing of those objects. The universal Op{P1,P2}
with respect to objects P1 and P2— according to Le´sniewski’s deﬁnition—will only have
the properties common to objects P1 and P2. Therefore, the object Op{P1,P2} will have n
properties. This being the case, Op{P1,P2}—thanks to the principle of extensionality—will
be identical with the object P1, which also possesses n properties, that is, it will be an
individual. [my translation]
Let’s grant that by n and m Gryganiec understands sets of properties and not the
cardinalities of those sets (he is somewhat ambiguous about it, but if we do not grant
it, the argument obviously will not work).
Still, the argument is not very compelling. First, Gryganiec assumes that for P1
and P2 their universal exists. But neither Le´sniewski’s argument nor the Platonist
position requires that for any two objects there be an objects which is their universal.
But this is a minor scratch. More importantly, Gryganiec asks us to assume that there
exist two distinct individual objects one of which has all the properties that the other
has (and some more).But such a possibility is hard to imagine.
If one admits that being identical with an object is a property, and that not having
a property is also a property, then take the property of being identical with P2 (call it
f ). P1 clearly does not have property f . Then P1 has the property of not having the

2.9 On Universals
51
property f . But since P2 has all the properties of P1, P2 also has the property of not
having the property f . That is, P2 has the property of not having the property that
it obviously has, which does not seem possible. If, on the other hand, not having a
property is not treated as a property, Le´sniewski’s argument does not work anyway
and there is no point in putting forward a counterexample.
We can try to salvage Gryganiec’s argument by denying that being identical with
an object is a property. If so, we need a stronger and yet reasonable notion of property.
Now, the problem is that spatio-temporal location seems to be a good candidate for a
property of an individual even in this stronger sense. But then, P2 could not have all
the properties that P1 has unless they completely overlapped. But if overlapping non-
identicals is the metaphysical construct that has to be conjured to make the argument
work, the argument is at least controversial.
Le´sniewski later formulated a formalized version of his argument. The new ver-
sion did not employ the notion of a property and was expressed in the language of
Ontology. I will get back to this argument in Sect.4.5 after introducing the required
formal apparatus.
2.10 Further Readings
As for Le´sniewski’s philosophical views, the standard place to start is Luschei (1962).
For a reader who wishes to see the character in a wider perspective, (Wole´nski 1985)
(in Polish) is the classic—a good English translation of it is Wole´nski (1989). He
has a chapter on Le´sniewski, which as far as technical aspects of the logical sys-
tems are concerned is much more detailed than Luschei’s book, but is not meant
to be comprehensive. Other background-covering works are Wole´nski (1986a and
1999). The Polish school of logic is presented in a more general survey on the devel-
opment of logic between the two world wars in Grattan-Guinness (1981). Jadczak
(1993a,b) discusses Le´sniewski’s role in the Lvov-Warsaw school. Le´sniewski’s let-
ters to Kazimierz Twardowski have been recently published as Le´sniewski (1999).
The question whether Le´sniewski was a philosopher at all is asked (and answered
positively) by Wole´nski (2000). Simons (2008a) provides a very readable survey in
his Stanford Encyclopedia entry on Le´sniewski.
Sanders (1996) discusses informally Le´sniewski’s motivations for his systems.
He does not go beyond the content of Luschei (1962) and Poli and Libardi (1999). A
good but quite informal survey of Le´sniewski’s achievements is Kearns (1967), which
also contains an interesting evaluation of Le´sniewski’s work. Kearns argues that
Le´sniewski’s view of the world is “defective in that it does not recognize structure”
(p. 88), which, he suggests, deprives “Mereology of signiﬁcance”. Le´sniewski’s early
philosophical views are discussed in French by Peeters (2005).
Rickey (1976, reprinted as Srzednicki and Stachniak 1998) provides a more tech-
nical overview of some results about Le´sniewski’s systems obtained before 1972.
An interesting survey of technical aspects of Le´sniewski’s work, especially of the
relation between Ontology and set theory has been published by Surma (1977).

Le´sniewski’s Early Philosophical Views
Le´sniewski’s view on truth-bearers in the context of the Lvov-Warsaw school is
presented in Wole´nski and Rojszczak (2005).
Sinisi (1966) discusses Le´sniewski’s criticism of Whitehead’s theory of events.
Betti (2004a) presents Le´sniewski’s solution to the liar paradox and argues that it
was Le´sniewski and not Tarski who suggested regimentation of natural language as
a device which is necessary to avoid paradoxes.
Regarding paradoxes, an interesting account which employs some of Le´sniewski’s
ideas is Hi˙z (1984). The relation between the early and informal solution to Russell’s
paradox from 1914 and the later development of Le´sniewski’s formal systems are
explored by Sinisi (1976).
Le´sniewski’s nominalism is nicely discussed by Hintze (1995), and the connection
between it and Goodman’s approach is explored by Prakel (1983). Simons provides
a good introduction to Le´sniewski’s nominalistic inscriptional approach to metalogic
(2002) and provides a good background on nominalism in the Lvov-Warsaw school
(1993, reprinted in Srzednicki and Stachniak 1998).
Tadeusz Kotarbi´nski, Le´sniewski’s good friend, used Le´sniewski’s systems as a
tool while putting forward his own reism (Kotarbi´nski 1929). As Wole´nski (1986b)
convincingly explains, Ontology itself is neutral with respect to the problem and it
is rather the form of the logical system which makes it easier to speak of reducing
various non-concrete terms to other terms. In other words, Le´sniewski’s systems
do not contain terms intended to represent abstract entities, but if there were such
entities, it would be possible to express facts about them in Le´sniewski’s languages.
There is also an interesting connection between Brentano’s analysis of categorical
propositions and Ontology, explored in Simons (1984).
An important discussion of the impact of Le´sniewski’s thought can be found
in Betti (2008b). While Tarski shared nominalistic intuitions with Le´sniewski and
Tarskian impossibility of giving a satisfactory theory of truth for ordinary language
andtheanalysisofquotationmarkscanbealreadyfoundinLe´sniewski,therearedeep
discrepancies between the interests of Tarski and Le´sniewski. While the latter was
not interested in model theory, the former was partially responsible for its origination.
While the former enjoyed working on set theory and metalogic, the latter focused
on purely axiomatic work on logical systems, without doing much metatheory and
deﬁnitely not liking set theory. Yet, Betti convincingly argues that the story about
a great breakup between the two logicians is a myth: Tarski’s interest were quite
different to start with and it seems to her “that the whole story was more, from
Tarski’s point of view, a ﬁght for freedom from a 100 percent genius master, one
whose commitment to a radical philosophical position was, for an extraordinarily
gifted and ambitious mathematician, very much in the way.” (Betti 2008a, 56)
A somewhat surprising similarity between Le´sniewski and Mally has been dis-
covered and described by Gombocz (1979).
Le´sniewski’s systems are also known for their application to history of philosophy.
Thom (1986) interestingly attempts to cast new light on Parmenides, Gorgias, Leu-
cippus and Democritus using a modiﬁed version of Ontology. Henry (1972, 1969)
attempted to apply Le´sniewski’s logics to analysis of some medieval concepts.

Chapter 3
Le´sniewski’s Protothetic
Abstract Protothetic is Le´sniewski’s generalized system of propositional calculus:
one is allowed to use quantiﬁers binding propositional variables and variables repre-
senting various connectives or higher-order function variables. First, I describe the
historical context of its development, discuss the crucial notion of semantic categories
and explain Le´sniewski’s original notation. The notation uses wheels and spokes to
graphically represent connectives, so that geometric relations between connectives
correspond to certain logical relations. Then I move on to Le´sniewski’s motivations
for Protothetic (especially his dissatisfaction with Principia Mathematica). Since
Protothetic resulted from gradual generalizations of the propositional calculus, I
describe all those generalizations and provide some examples of proofs. Finally, I
include an annotated guide to the secondary literature of the subject.
3.1 Introduction
Le´sniewski’s ﬁrst step in his logical investigations was a construction of a set theory
(1916) (his theory of parthood called mereology) meant “to contribute as much as
possible to the justiﬁcation of modern mathematics” (1916, 129). He did not fully
formalize it—he used variables, introduced axioms and deﬁnitions, and proved theo-
rems, but except for the use of variables, all these were given in a regimented version
of the natural language.1 All his publications on Mereology (1928,1930a,b,1931a)
shared this level of formalization. Only around 1930, quite in parallel, he started
publishing on the logic underlying his Mereology:
1 Later, he commented: “In the year 1915 I made a ﬁrst attempt to give a deductive form to my
conception of classes and collections, which I was using in the analysis of the ‘antinomy’ of Russell.
Relying on four propositions called axioms, and using a number of other propositions which I called
deﬁnitions, I arrived at a number of interesting theorems with methods which I was then able to
use.” (1928, 227)

Le´sniewski’s Protothetic
While using colloquial language in scientiﬁc work and attempting to control its ‘logic’, I
endeavored to somehow rationalize the way in which I was using in colloquial language
various types of propositions passed down to us by ‘traditional logic’. While relying on
‘linguistic instinct’ and the often non-uniform tradition of ‘traditional logic,’ I attempted to
devise a consistent method of working with propositions which were ‘singular’, ‘particular’,
‘general’, ‘existential’ etc. …Having acquired considerable experience in the consistent sci-
entiﬁc operation with these ‘singular’ propositions2 and having at my disposal a considerable
number of what were for me thoroughly reliable theoretical syntheses which, although they
were constructed more or less ad hoc and not formulated within the limits of a deductive
system, nevertheless made it much easier for me to elucidate for myself and others the sub-
tleties of my scientiﬁc language, I wished to take one step further and, using the ‘singular
propositions of the type ‘A ε b,’ to base all my deliberations on some clearly formulated
axiomatization which would harmonize with my theoretical practice in this domain at that
time. (1931b, 366–367)
The system resulting from this investigations, which dealt mainly with predication
was called ‘Ontology’. Le´sniewski formulated the ﬁrst single axiom of this system
in 1920, but for a while he did not publish his results.3
Simultaneously, he started working on a theory that coped with the propositional
aspect of his reasonings. In 1921, inspired by Łukasiewicz’s modiﬁcation of Nicod’s
system of propositional logic (Lukasiewicz 1921) he postulated two things: (1) that
hispropositionalcalculusshouldhaveonlyoneprimitivelogicalconstant,and(2)that
there should be no additional symbol for deﬁnitions, but rather that deﬁnitions should
be written using that primitive term.4
In 1922 Tarski, Le´sniewski’s only Ph.D. student, proved that if the universal
quantiﬁer binding propositional variables is admitted, the equivalence sign sufﬁces
as the only sentential connective in a functionally complete propositional calculus.5
Since then, they cooperated on the construction of both a theory of propositional
deduction (called Protothetic from ‘ﬁrst theses’ in Greek, loosely speaking) and of
a theory which may be roughly characterized as dealing with predication (called
Ontology).6
This chapter will be devoted to the development of the propositional construc-
tion. Protothetic originated as the result of gradual axiomatic generalization of the
propositional calculus. The ﬁrst propositional system (S) given by Le´sniewski is a
2 i.e. propositions of the form ‘a is b’.
3 “This theory has for some time now become known to a wider circle of my colleagues and students
through copies of my university lectures.”(1930b, 608)
4 “In deﬁning the functions of the theory of deduction in terms of other such functions, both Sheffer
and Nicod use a special equal-sign for deﬁnitions which they do not deﬁne in terms of the primitive
functions of the system …. This circumstance makes it difﬁcult to say whether Nicod’s theory of
deduction is in fact constructed out of the single primitive term: ‘|’.
“In 1921 I realized that a system of the theory of deduction containing deﬁnitions 44 would
actually be constructed from a single term only if the deﬁnitions were written 45 down with just
that primitive term and without recourse to a special equal-sign for 46 deﬁnitions.” (1938b, 418)
5 A propositional calculus is called functionally complete (in the relevant sense) if all extensional
propositional connectives can be deﬁned by means of the primitive symbols of its language.
6 Most of the work was done by Le´sniewski, but quite often he employs results obtained by Tarski,
crediting him explicitly.

purely equivalential propositional calculus without quantiﬁers. The second system
(S1) admitted quantiﬁers binding both propositional variables and variables repre-
senting propositional connectives. Extending S1 with a certain rule (rule η) results
in a stronger system S2. However, rule η was quite complicated, so it was replaced
by another, simpler rule (called the rule of extensionality, η⋆). The result of this
replacement is called S3. A conditional reformulation of S3 was called S4 and an
equivalential modiﬁcation of S3 (deﬁnitions were written differently) was called
S5.
There are at least two difﬁculties in giving a historically adequate account of
these systems. The ﬁrst one is that sources are sparse. Many important manuscripts
have been destroyed during the Second World War. The systems are reconstructed
mainly on the following basis: Tarski’s dissertation (Tarski 1923), the ﬁrst eleven
paragraphs of Le´sniewski’s “Fundamentals of a New System of the Foundations of
Mathematics” (Le´sniewski 1929),7 and some lecture notes taken by his students,
edited by Srzednicki and Stachniak (1988).8
The second difﬁculty is that the standards of exposition that Le´sniewski followed
were quite different from what we are used to nowadays. That is, there is no explicit
deﬁnition of a language, rules are sometimes described quite vaguely and sometimes
only mentioned without explicit statement. The closes that his presentation gets to
a precise formulation is in his semi-formalized Terminological Explications, whose
accessibility is problematic for other reasons (see Sect.6.4).
I will begin with a brief account of the semantic categories insofar as this notion
is useful for describing Le´sniewski’s systems and the formal languages he uses.
Next, I will devote some time to Le´sniewski’s notation of propositional connectives.
Then, I will present the six propositional calculi. Having done this, I will provide
some examples of proofs in Protothetic. Finally, I will survey secondary literature
pertaining to Protothetic.
3.2 Semantic Categories and the Language of Protothetic
The idea of segregating expressions of a given language according to the role they
play can be traced back at least to Aristotle (ﬁrst ﬁve chapters of On interpretation).
A theory providing such a division has been developed in late medieval scholastic
logic. In the modern era the key philosopher to discuss this issue seems to have been
Husserl. He outlined a sketch of the theory of Bedeutungskategorien (categories of
meaning) in his Logical Investigations.
7 The twelth paragraph being prepared for publication in 1938 survived as (Le´sniewski 1938b).
8 Before the notes were published, they were accessible to very few of Le´sniewski’s followers. One
of them, J. Słupecki provided an impressive reconstruction Protothetic in his (1953). An unpublished
dissertation titled Computative Protothetic by Owen Le Blanc (1991) is an invaluable source of
information about computative formulations of Protothetic (Le´sniewski (1938b) somewhat hints at
the computative formulation).

Le´sniewski’s Protothetic
The ﬁrst formalized theory of semantic categories was constructed by Le´sniewski
around 1921. The ﬁrst mention of this fact seems to be the second footnote of
Tarski (1923), but Le´sniewski employed his categories in 1929 Le´sniewski (1929)
as an alternative to Russell’s and Whitehead’s theory of types. This study has been
developed by (Ajdukiewicz 1935), another logician from the Lvov-Warsaw school.
However, from the publication of “On syntactic connectivity” (Ajdukiewicz 1935)
onward, the subject of this theory was rather called ‘syntactic categories’.
The underlying idea is that two expressions belong to the same semantic category
if they are interchangeable in any sentence without the loss of meaningfulness, i.e. if
one is replaced by another in a meaningful sentence, the resulting expression is also
a meaningful sentence.
In all of Le´sniewski’s systems there are two basic semantic categories: names
and sentences. For Le´sniewski, a name is any expression (complex or not) that may
take the place of either M or N in a sentence of the form: ‘M is N’.9 This is quite
straightforward in Latin or Polish which do not have articles.10 For example, all of the
following are well-formed in Latin11: ‘Canis est canis’, ‘Canis est animal’, ‘Socrates
est animal’, ‘Chimera est animal’, ‘Chimera est Chimera’ and therefore ‘canis’ (dog),
‘animal’, ‘Socrates’ and ‘Chimera’ are all names on this account. Beside expressions
of those two categories there are syncategorematic expressions whose role is to
construct more complex expressions when applied to some expressions. They are
called functors.12 We will need a piece of notation from Ajdukiewicz (1935), called
index notation.
Deﬁnition 3.1 (Semantic Category, index notation) Every propositional variable or
propositional constant belongs to one and the same class called the semantic category
of sentences. If an expression belongs to this category, its index is s. Every name
variable or name constant belongs to one and the same category, called the semantic
category of names. If an expression belongs to this category, its index is n. Every
expression of a language whose index is neither s nor n is called a functor. What
semantic category it belongs to is determined by (1) how many expressions it is
applied to in order to construct a well-formed expression, (2) what the semantic
categories of the expressions it is applied to are, and (3) what the semantic category
of the whole expression which it generates properly concatenated with its arguments
is. If a functor f applies to l arguments: α1, . . . , αl of categories (respectively) of the
9 The fact that this account can be found in a fairly standard textbook used those days in Poland
(kotarbinski 1929) indicates that Le´sniewski’s notion is by no means unusual.
10 Ultimately, I will use the notion of semantic category with reference to formalized languages
only, where related issues do not arise.
11 It is sometimes believed that in Latin ‘est’ has to occur as the last word in sentences like these.
However plausible it is with respect to certain forms of ancient Latin, the rule does not apply to
Medieval Latin, which was the language that logicians used to work in for centuries. The scholastic
grammar allowed inﬁx notation for ‘est’ and I see no reason not to use scholastic Latin in contexts
like the present one.
12 The term comes from Kotarbi´nski.

Expressions of (various systems of) Protothetic can be built from: propositional

the universal quantiﬁer, any constant of any semantic category if it is correctly deﬁned
in a given system by means of symbols which have been previously introduced
(what a correct deﬁnition is will be explained later). Whenever a category has been
introduced, variables can be introduced which belong to this category and quantiﬁer
can bind them. One way to put it more formally is this:
Deﬁnition 3.2 Expressions of Protothetic are constructed from:
• Propositional variables: p, q,r, possibly with numerical subscripts. They are of
semantic category s.
• Functor variables: for any category τ constructed from s’s there are variables
f τ, gτ, f τ
1 , f τ

scripted with variables or constants of lower semantic categories (in which case
they are called functor variables with parameters).
• One primitive propositional connective of category s

• The universal quantiﬁer: ∀(binding variables of all categories).14

to the rules of deﬁnition (to be introduced). Constants can be subscripted with
variables or constants of lower semantic categories (in which case they are called
constants with parameters). I will discuss the role of parameters in Sect.3.6.
13 Strictly speaking, Le´sniewski didn’t use category superscripts. Nor will we, assuming that the
context will make it clear what category a variable is supposed to belong to.
14 Le´sniewski used brackets to mark quantiﬁcation. In general, the way Le´sniewski introduced
his language would be somewhat foreign to the modern reader. The presentation I use does not
follow Le´sniewski to the letter. However, I believe that in the present context the gain in readability
outweighs the philosophical advantages of employing Le´sniewski’s notation and his inscriptional
syntax. See however remarks in Sect.6.4.

The formation rules are:
• If φ is an expression of Protothetic of category
τ
σ1···σn and expressions of Protothetic
α1, . . . , αn are respectively of categories σ1, . . . , σn, φ(α1, . . . , αn) is a well–
formed expression of Protothetic of category τ.
• If χτ is a variable of category τ and φ is an expression of Prothetic of category s,
then ∀χτ φ is an expression of Protothetic of category s.

3.3 Le´sniewski’s Notation
Le´sniewski introduced his own idiosyncratic notation for one- and two-place sen-
tential connectives. Its particular feature was that the shape of a symbol encoded its
truth-table. In this section I will describe this notation due to its own merits, but later
on I will use a modern notation for the sake of accessibility.15
First of all, this is a preﬁx notation. Functors are written before arguments, argu-
ments are placed in parentheses and are not separated from each other by commas.
Universal quantiﬁcation binding variables of any semantic category is expressed by
the whole sequence of those variables put within the lower corner-brackets: ⌊
⌋.
For instance, a universal quantiﬁer binding all propositional variables p1, . . . , pn is:
⌊p1, . . . , pn⌋. The scope of a quantiﬁer is marked by upper-corner brackets: ⌈⌉.
For example, what we would write as ‘∀p p’ in Le´sniewski’s notation is: ‘⌊p⌋⌈p⌉’.
1- Place Connectives
The basic constituent of each 1-place functor symbol is a horizontal line:‘−’. By
adding to this line vertical lines on its ends (two such lines are possible) in all possible
combinations we obtain all possible 1-place functors. The rules are simple16:
• A vertical line occurs on the left side, iff (if the argument has the value 0, the whole
expression has the value 1).
• A vertical line occurs on the right side, iff (if the argument has the value 1, the
whole expression has the value 1).
Hence, we obtain four possible 1-place functors: ⊣, ⊢, ⊢⊣, −, which can be described
by the following classical matrix:
15
In (Le´sniewski 1929) his notation seems to have been used for the ﬁrst time, but, strictly
speaking, Le´sniewski explains it in his (1938a). It is commented on in Srzednicki and Stachniak
(1988). (Luschei 1962, 289–305) also devotes some space to this ideographic notation.
16 Le´sniewski himself was not committed to the existence of truth-values, and he did not speak
about them. He did not provide any formal semantics for his systems at all. I do say things in terms of
truth-values but it does not entail that I am committed to their existence. For the sake of presentation
I just take it to be a convenient abbreviation to speak about ‘having truth value 0’ instead of ‘being
false’ and ‘having truth value 1’ instead of ‘being true’.

3.3 Le´sniewski’s Notation
63
p ⊢⊣−⊣⊢
1 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 0 1
The left side of the horizontal line corresponds to argument’s having value 0 and
the right side corresponds to argument’s having value 1. A vertical stroke occurs if
for that value the whole expression has value 1. ‘⊢⊣’ is called verum: if the argument
has value 0, the whole expression has value 1 (hence the stroke on the left), and if
the argument has value 1, the whole expression has value 1 (hence the stroke on the
right). ‘−’ is called falsum. No matter whether the argument’s value is 0 or 1, the
value of the whole is 0 (hence no vertical strokes). ‘⊢’ is negation. If the argument’s
value is 0, the value of the whole is 1 (hence the stroke on the left), and if the
argument’s value is 1, the whole has value 0 (hence no stroke on the right). ‘⊣’ is
called assertion. The value of the whole is 1 just in case the value of the argument is
1 (hence the stroke on the right and no stroke on the left).17
2- Place Connectives
The basis of a 2-place functor is a circle: ‘◦’ (called ‘the hub’). To this circle four
possible lines (‘spokes’) can be added in four directions—up, down, left, right. The
rules of adding these lines are as follows:
• A line to the left occurs iff for arguments having values respectively 1, 0, the whole
has value 1.
• A line to the right occurs iff for arguments having values respectively 0, 1, the
whole has value 1.
• A line upwards occurs iff for arguments of value 0, 0, the whole has value 1.
• A line downwards occurs iff for arguments of value 1, 1, whole has value 1.
These rules can be pictured by the following schema:
0 1
1 0
0 0
1 1
According to these rules we obtain 16 possible 2-place functors. To characterize
them, we shall apply the following method: a 2-place functor will be characterized
by a 4-place sequence of elements 1 and 0, simply by giving values taken by the
whole expression when arguments have values, respectively, 11, 10, 01, 00.18
17 (Luschei 1962, 292) calls verum the tautologous connection of one argument and falsum the
contradictory connection of one argument.
18 Names of functors are usually given according to Luschei’s translation (Luschei 1962: 290–291),
with slight differences.

A peculiar feature of this notation is that there is a correspondence between geo-
metrical properties of symbols of functors and the logical properties of these functors.
I don’t want to get into details (see, Urbaniak 2006), but here are two examples:
1. Let us deﬁne the relation of inclusion between two functors:
Notice ﬁrst that in Le´sniewski’s notation the deﬁniens comes ﬁrst and the
deﬁniendum occurs on the right side of the formula. As we can see, we have
deﬁned the expression ⊂of category
s
s
ss
s
ss .
Thatis,wedeﬁneaconnective,⊂,whichtakestwo2-placesententialconnectives
as arguments and yields a sentential expression as a result. The variables f, h
represent sentential connectives, and r, s are propositional variables. In modern
notation:
∀f, h [ f ⊂h ≡∀r, s (r f s →r h s)]
The inclusion of 1-place functors is deﬁned analogously (i.e. we should change
the number of arguments of functors and the number of variables which the
quantiﬁer binds).
Now, it turns out that a functor h of the same number of arguments as f includes
functor f in the above sense iff f is graphically a part (proper or not) of h. For
example, ‘
’ geometrically includes the functor ‘
’, and it also includes it
according to the above deﬁnition, because for any r, s it is true that if
(r, s)
then (r, s).
2. Deﬁne the functor cnv of category
s
sss
ss by:19
19 Observe that instead of using indices to mark the semantic category of a variable, Le´sniewski
used various shapes of brackets surrounding the arguments. The strategy, alas, is less systematic

3.3 Le´sniewski’s Notation
65
which reads:
∀f,r, s [cnv( f )(r, s) ≡f (s,r)].
That is, applying cnv to a connective f yields a connective: cnv( f ) which
applied to two sentential argument yields truth-value 1 iff f itself applied to
those arguments but in reversed order yields truth value 1.
Wemaysaythat g isaconverseof f iff g isequivalenttocnv⟨f ⟩.Thegeometrical
rule is:
Two 2-place functors, say f, g are converses of each other iff both:
• f has a horizontal line on a given side iff g has a horizontal line on the opposite
side, and
• f has a vertical line in a given direction iff g also has a vertical line in the
same direction.
For example the following pairs are converses of each other:
, ;
,
;
,
.
The notation can be systematically extended to connectives of more arguments
while preserving the correlation between the shape and the logical relationship
between functors (see Urbaniak, 2006).
3.4 Le´sniewski’s Protothetic and Principia Mathematica
A very important feature of Protothetic is that deﬁnitions are treated as expressions
of this system, and equivalence (or implication, depending on the formulation) is
treated as the only primitive connective. For this reason, Le´sniewski’s account of
deﬁnitions varies from that of Russell’s. Russell treated deﬁnitions as expressions
of the meta–language used to introduce abbreviations. Le´sniewski objected to this
treatment on three counts:
1. If a deﬁnition is to be an expression of the meta-language, then the meaning of
‘iff’s in deﬁnitions is more vague than it would have been otherwise. It is not
sure whether it contributes anything to the system, allowing to generate new non-
equiform theorems, or whether it is rather just an unofﬁcial way of abbreviating
theorems of the basic language of the system. It is not obvious (at least, if you are
as fastidious as Le´sniewski was) whether such a deﬁnition is a rule of inference,
a notational rule or just an expression of the author’s state of mind.
than that of using indices because nowhere did he give a clear and general explanation of how the
shape of brackets corresponds to the semantic category involved. In practice, this did not cause
much confusion.

66

Le´sniewski’s Protothetic
2. If having as simple a formulation as possible is an essential virtue of an axiomatic
system (as Le´sniewski believed), it would be useful to reduce deﬁnitions to
something already present in the system.
3. As it turns out, some deﬁnitions in Le´sniewski’s systems are creative.20 That is,
introducing deﬁnitions may allow to prove something which does not contain
the deﬁned term, but is unprovable without deﬁnitions. But if deﬁnitions are
to be treated only as meta-linguistic abbreviations, they should not have any
“logical strength”. In contrast, if a deﬁnition is just taken to be an axiom of a
speciﬁc kind, the fact that its addition strengthens the system is less surprising.
Some people believe that deﬁnitions should not be creative, some people don’t.
Le´sniewski belonged to the latter group. (Also, see Chap.6 for more details about
Le´sniewski’s view of deﬁnitions.)
Le´sniewski’s criticism of Russell was actually a little bit more complex. Rumour
has it that Le´sniewski devoted one of his Warsaw seminars to Principia Mathemat-
ica.21 It took him (the legend continues) one semester to read one page with his
students. Indeed, a distinctive feature of Le´sniewski’s style is that he always very
meticulously (and somewhat uncharitably) tries to reconstruct the view that he is
about to criticize. To the best of my knowledge there is no written account of the
content of the famous seminar. However, when Le´sniewski started publishing his On
the Foundations of Mathematics series, the ﬁrst chapter (included in his 1927) titled
“On some questions regarding the sense of the ‘logistic’ theses” was devoted to a
criticism of Principia Mathematica.
AlthoughLe´sniewskihadhisﬁrstcontactwithsomethinglikemodernformallogic
already in 1911, it took him quite a few years to convince himself of the importance
of symbolization for the development of logic and mathematics. The basic problem
for him, it seems, was the lack of clarity as to the status of axioms and theorems of
a given theory, to which the usual comments were no cure:
Theﬁrstencounterwith‘symboliclogic’createdwithinmeastrongaversiontothatdiscipline
for a number of years to come. Even the exposition of its elements included in the book
by Łukasiewicz, and certain other expositions of ‘symbolic logic’ which I attempted in
succession, wishing somehow to absorb the results reached by the exponents of this science
were incomprehensible to me, and not because of my own fault… Not possessing the faculty
of entering into the spirit of other people’s ideas, I was estranged from the science itself by the
considerable effect of the obscure and ambiguous comments provided by its exponents. The
decidedly sceptical dominant note of the position I occupied for a number of years in relation
to‘symbolic logic’ stemmed from the fact that I was not able to become conscious of the
20 Słupecki (1955) contains a proof of this claim for Ontology, and (Slupecki 1953) mentions this
property of Protothetic. Generally the idea is that one can think of the language of Protothetic
or Ontology as a higher–order language. Le´sniewski’s formulation did not contain an axiom of
comprehension. Instead, it contained the rule that every formula of a certain form deﬁnes a new
constant. A version of the axiom of comprehension was obtainable by existential instantiation after
the introduction of a constant. Hence, for instance, in the formulations of Ontology which contain
certain form of the axiom of comprehension, rules of deﬁnition are no longer creative (stachniak,
1981).
21 A story I heard from A.W. Mostowski in a discussion. I do not recall seeing the claim anywhere
in print.

3.4 Le´sniewski’s Protothetic and Principia Mathematica
67
real ‘sense’ of the axioms and theorems of that theory—‘of what’ and ‘what’, respectively, it
was desired to ‘assert’ by means of the axioms and theorems. (Le´sniewski, 1927, 181–182)
His criticism focused on the use of Russell’s assertion sign (‘⊢’), the mean-
ing assigned to logical constants in Principia Mathematica, and Whitehead’s and
Russell’s comments about those symbols. He opens his discussion with the follow-
ing words:
The character of the semantical doubts which occupied me for some time during attempts,
long futile, to read the works written by ‘logicists’ can easily be grasped by anybody by a
careful analysis of the comments which Whitehead and Russell provide for particular types
of expressions which occur in the ‘theory of deduction’, and he may also reﬂect on such
an occasion how much the aforesaid comments are infused with reﬁned cruelty towards a
reader who is accustomed to paying some attention to anything he reads. (Le´sniewski 1927,
182)
As an example, Le´sniewski considers ⋆1.3.:
⊢: q. →.p ∨q
The comment one can ﬁnd in Principia Mathematica is: “This principle states: if q
is true, then p or q is true”. To ﬁgure out why this is the right reading Le´sniewski
tries to ﬁnd in Principia Mathematica an explanation of the meaning of expressions
like:
⊢.p
p ∨q
p →q
Turnstile
As for ⊢, two comments that Le´sniewski ﬁnds in Principia Mathematica are:
(3.1) “The sign ‘⊢’, called the ‘assertion-sign’ means that what follows is asserted. It is
required for distinguishing a complete proposition, which we assert, from any subordinate
propositions contained in it but not asserted.”
(3.2)“Insymbols,if‘p’isaproposition,‘p’byitselfwillstandfortheunassertedproposition,
while the asserted proposition will be designated by ‘⊢.p’. The sign ‘⊢’ is called the
assertion-sign; it may be read ‘it is true that’ (although philosophically this is not exactly
what it means).”
So, what is asserted by ‘⊢.p’? Passage (3.1) suggests that the propositions that are
asserted are those that immediately follow the turnstile and a dot (so in this reading
it is p itself that is asserted). This reading is also supported by the following:
(3.3) “The dots after the assertion-signs, indicate its range; that is to say, everything following
is asserted, until we reach either an equal number of dots, preceding a sign of implication or
the end of the sentence.”

68
3
Le´sniewski’s Protothetic
On the other hand, passage (3.2) tells us that it is the whole expression ⊢.p that
is asserted. This reading has also another textual support:
(3.4) “On all occasions where, in Principia Mathematica, we have an asserted proposition of
the form ‘⊢. f x’ or ‘⊢. f p’ this is not to be taken as meaning ‘⊢.(x). f x’ or ‘⊢.(p). f p’.”
As Le´sniewski puts it:
After reading all the passages of the work which refer to the assertion sign and expressions
of the type ‘⊢.p’ the reader who is not particularly distinguished by exuberant frivolity can
hardly say that he understands the intentions of the authors. (Le´sniewski 1927, 183)
Indeed, Le´sniewski emphasizes that so far the only clear indication as to how to read
‘⊢’ in natural language is that one cannot read it as ‘it is true that’ without changing
its meaning.
In his attempt to clarify, Le´sniewski formulates three questions:
(1) Suppose ‘p’ is a proposition. Is ‘⊢.p’ also a proposition?
(2) Suppose ‘p’ is a proposition having a certain sense. Does ‘⊢.p’ have the
same sense?
(3) What should we take to be Whitehead’s and Russell’s axioms and theorems?
(a) whole expressions (‘⊢.’ included) or (b) just those subexpressions which follow
‘⊢.’?
Le´sniewski then discusses a few initially plausible readings of ‘⊢’ and their rela-
tion to the above questions.
Reading A. ‘⊢.p’ means ‘we (Whitehead and Russell) assert that p’. The answer
to question (1) is positive. The answer to question (2) is negative. The answer to
question (3) is (a).
The problem here is that on this reading the axioms and theorems are very speciﬁc
statements about the authors of the theory and express only the fact that the authors
of the given theory assert this or that formula. As Le´sniewski puts it:
…a system created from that type of proposition, is not a system of logic at all; It
could rather be considered as a deductive confession of the authors of the given theory.
(Le´sniewski 1927, 187)
Reading B. ‘⊢.p’ means ‘that which follows is asserted: p’. On this view, accord-
ing to Le´sniewski, the answer to question (1) is negative. For him,
that which follows, is asserted: p
is not a proposition, but rather “a peculiar composite of three parts following
one after another, of which the ﬁrst, the assertion sign, is a proposition in the
form of a single expression having the same sense as the proposition “that which
follows is asserted”, the second is formed of dots, and the third, the expression
‘p’ is a proposition, as we assumed.” (Le´sniewski 1927, 185) Thus, the complex
expression which is not a proposition does not have the same sense as its constituent
proposition. The answer to question (3) on this reading is (b).

3.4 Le´sniewski’s Protothetic and Principia Mathematica
69
Le´sniewski points out that if this is how one should read ‘⊢’, it seems that White-
head and Russell are not using the symbol consistently, for they sometimes put it
in front of a formula which they certainly do not want to assert as theorems. For
instance we can ﬁnd in Principia Mathematica statements like:22
Similarly ⊢: (y) : (∃x). f (x, y).
Reading C. ‘⊢.p’ has the same meaning as ‘p’. The authors put ‘⊢’ in front of a
proposition just to suggest that it is a proposition which they are asserting (but the
assertion is not part of the content of a proposition). We should count as axioms
whole expressions, ‘⊢’ included. Le´sniewski suggests that the same objection that
he put forward against (B), mutatis mutandis, applies here.
Use of Variables and Semantic Ascent
Continuing his comments on ⋆1.3. Le´sniewski notices that according to ⋆1.01. impli-
cation ‘p →q’ is deﬁned by ‘¬p ∨q’, where deﬁnitions are supposed to preserve
the meaning. Thus he takes ⋆1.3. to mean the same as:
(3.5) ‘¬q. ∨.p ∨r’
Now the question is how we should understand the negation. The explanation to be
found in Principia Mathematica is:
If p is any proposition, the proposition ‘not p’ or ‘p is false’, will be represented by ‘¬p’.
Thus it seems that according to Whitehead and Russell reading ‘¬p’ as either ‘not p’
or ‘p is false’ does not change the meaning of what is claimed. This is problematic for
Le´sniewski, because in ‘p is false’, the symbol p no longer represents a proposition
the way it does in ‘¬p’. When we say ‘…is false’, the dots should be ﬁlled by
a name of a sentence (or proposition), not by the sentence itself. For instance the
expression ‘Spiderman is bald is false’ is not a well-formed sentence. Rather, it has
to say something about the sentence, as in “ ‘Spiderman is bald’ is false”.23 That
being the case, the sentence:
‘p’ is false
does not mean the same as ‘¬p’.24 They may be equivalent, perhaps, but the former
says something about a linguistic expression. The latter does not seem to do that.
‘Not: Spiderman is bald’ is not a sentence about a sentence: it is about Spiderman
and his baldness (if you will), but it does not contain a name that refers to a sentence
(and frankly, it doesn’t sound like a correct sentence either).
Similarly, Whitehead and Russell explain the meaning of disjunction:
22 Le´sniewski refers to p. XXIV of the ﬁrst volume of the 1910 edition of Principia Mathematica.
23 Needless to say, the Spiderman example isn’t originally Le´sniewski’s.
24 I put aside the worries about variables occurring in quotations.

70
3
Le´sniewski’s Protothetic
If p and q are any propositions, the proposition ‘p or q’, i.e. ‘either p is true or q is true’
where the alternatives are to be not mutually exclusive, will be represented by ‘p ∨q’.
But then (3.5) means the same as:
(3.6) ‘ ‘q’ is false’ is true or ‘p or r’ is true.
which expands to:
(3.7) ‘ ‘q’ is false’ is true or ‘ ‘p’ is true or ‘r’ is true’ is true.
Again, ‘or’ occurs in the above, and since it is taken to mean the same as ‘∨’ we can
easily climb the ladder of semantic ascent, allegedly preserving the meaning of the
whole sentence:
(3.8) ‘‘q’ is false’ is true or either ‘ ‘p’ is true’ is true or ‘ ‘r’ is true’ is true.
Quite correctly, however, Le´sniewski points out that semantic ascent does not pre-
serve the meaning. Propositions that mean the same are about the same. But, for
instance, ‘Paris is in France’ is a sentence about Paris and its location, whereas ‘
‘Paris is in France’ is true’ is about a sentence and its relation to the world.
In General
Indeed, Whitehead and Russell were not perfectly clear or consistent in their use of
‘⊢’ or propositional connectives. Nor were they very careful when they explained
the classical connectives in terms of semantic ascent. This Le´sniewski took to be
quite a serious problem:
…the reader will constantly wilt under the weight of this medley of interpretations. The
impenetrable chaos which is the actual result of the reader’s effort aimed at grasping the
sense of the ‘primitive proposition’ ⋆1.3., could be even intensiﬁed, if the reader refers to
a series of other comments contained in the work of Whitehead and Russell and connected
with the comments on the mentioned problems, which do not harmonize with the authors’
comments already quoted or even with one another. (Le´sniewski 1927, 194)
On one hand, Le´sniewski’s criticism does not seem as crippling as he himself
(quite uncharitably) took it to be.25 Many logicians had (and have) decent sense of
understanding of what was going on in PM, despite those, after all minor, philosoph-
ical issues. On the other hand, the criticism led Le´sniewski to ignore the assertion
sign to and avoid any kind of treatment of complex formulas which takes them to
be saying something about their constitutive formulas. This indeed was a sensible
move.
25 For instance, one interpretation is that Whitehead and Russell used ‘⊢’ to precede those formulas
which they took to belong to the system they were developing. Then ‘⊢p ∨¬p’ could be read as: ‘
‘p ∨¬p’ is a theorem of the system under consideration’. The answer to (1) is positive, the answer
to (2) is negative, and the answer to (3) is (b). Perhaps, some occurrences of ‘⊢’ which precede
expressions which are not theorems of PM can be found in PM, but there is nothing wrong about
just saying that indeed, Whitehead and Russell sometimes made mistakes and misused the symbol.

3.5 Axiomatic Formulations

3.5 Axiomatic Formulations
What follows is a simpliﬁcation of the original account. The main issue here is that
Le´sniewski was a nominalist and his directives which he used to describe the system
were not meant to describe some abstract entity (say, a set of theorems). They rather
described how a system-token seen as a bunch of inscriptions is to be developed.
Indeed, his view on logical systems is quite dynamic: theorems are written expres-
sions, and the system physically grows or develops as new theorems and proofs are
being written down. This speciﬁc feature was mirrored in Le´sniewski’s explanations.
He was really concerned with speaking of his systems as if they were a bunch of
inscriptions. So, for instance, depending on the stage of development of a system,
some expressions may be meaningful or meaningless according to whether their def-
initions have been already written down. For the sake of simplicity of our description
I will not follow this approach, instead presenting a somewhat ‘Platonized’ version
of Protothetic using mainstream methods.
A few words about notational conventions. Variables p, q,r are propositional
variables within the system, variables f, g are variables of categories different than
s (the context will determine their category). φ, ψ, χ are meta–linguistic variables
standing for formulas, ζ (possibly with numerical subscripts) are schematic meta–
variables representing variables of various semantic categories and τ (possibly with
numerical subscripts) is a schematic letter standing for constants (propositional con-
stants or functors of other categories).26
System S
As discussed in (Le´sniewski 1929, 423–438), it had two axioms:
(S.1) ((p ≡r) ≡(q ≡p)) ≡(r ≡q)
(S.2) (p ≡(q ≡r)) ≡((p ≡q) ≡r)
and two rules:
[Detachment for equivalence] From ψ ≡χ and ψ infer χ.
[Substitution for equivalence]
From ψ ≡χ and φ infer φ(χ) (which results from φ by
replacing some of occurrences of ψ in φ by χ).
Thesystemconstitutesasoundandcompleteaxiomatizationoftheclassicalequiv-
alential calculus. That is, given the language of the theory contains only propositional
variables, brackets, and the equivalence symbols, the classical (semantical) conse-
quence operation coincides with deducibility in this system.
S is not functionally complete. That is, not all classical connectives can be deﬁned
in a language which contains classical equivalence but no quantiﬁcation binding
propositional variables.
26 At one point, ‘(ζ)’ is a name of a rule, but the context makes it clear and no ambiguities arise.

72

Le´sniewski’s Protothetic
S has an interesting feature. For any expression φ in the language of this system
(that is, correctly constructed from propositional variables and the equivalence sym-
bol) this expression is a theorem of S iff any propositional variable in φ occurs an
even number of times.27
System S1
This system (Le´sniewski 1929, 438–450) admitted quantiﬁers binding both propo-
sitional variables and ﬁrst-order functor variables. The system is based on three
axioms:
(S1.1)
∀p, q,r (((p ≡r) ≡(q ≡p)) ≡(r ≡q))
(S1.2)
∀p, q,r ((p ≡(q ≡r)) ≡((p ≡q) ≡r))
(S1.3) ∀g, p {∀f (g(p, p) ≡[∀r ( f (r,r) ≡g(p, p)) ≡
∀r ( f (r,r) ≡g(p ≡∀q q, p))] ≡∀q g(p, p)}
Tarski (1923) has shown that the system is functionally complete. First, he deﬁned
conjunction by:
p ∧q ≡∀f [p ≡[∀r (p ≡f (r)) ≡∀r (q ≡f (r))]]
Then, other standard connectives can be deﬁned:28
¬p ≡(p ≡∀q q)
p →q ≡(p ≡p ∧q)
p ∨q ≡(¬p →q)
Once these connectives are available, functional completeness straightforwardly
follows.
27 This seems to be the ﬁrst form of the so-called Le´sniewski-Mihailescu theorem (Mihailescu
1937). The difference is that Le´sniewski proved the theorem for a language without negation.
Mihailescu’s version applied to a language with equivalence and negation. For such s language the
theorem requires not only each variable but also the negation symbol to occur an even number of
times.
28 In fact, once the system enforces extensionality (which Tarski called the law of substitution):
∀p, q, f [(p ≡q) ∧f (p) →f (q)]
(or the corresponding inference rule), conjunction can be deﬁned by means of a simpler formula:
p ∧q ≡∀f (p ≡( f (p) ≡f (q)))

3.5 Axiomatic Formulations
73
It is common in the literature to call quantiﬁers binding propositional variables
only ﬁrst-order protothetical quantiﬁers, and to call other quantiﬁers higher-order
protothetical quantiﬁers. Interestingly, ﬁrst-order propositional quantiﬁcation alone
would not sufﬁce to deﬁne all truth–functional connectives using equivalence as the
sole primitive connective (see Surma 1977 for details). It only allows one to deﬁne
two propositional constants: false (∀p p) and true (∀p (p ≡p)), and four functions
of one argument: assertion (ass(p) ≡p), negation (¬p ≡[(∀p p) ≡p]), the
verum of p (ver(p) ≡(p ≡p)) and the falsum of p ( f al(p) ≡(¬p ≡p)) but this
does not yield functional completeness. Higher-order protothetical quantiﬁcation is
needed to deﬁne conjunction.
Now, (S1.3) might look convoluted, but once we employ deﬁnitions of other
connectives, things get quite simple. First of all, p ≡∀q q tells us that that p is
equivalent to something which is false, so we can render the expression as ¬p.
Secondly, the huge left-hand of the equivalence is just a fancy way of stating the
conjunction of g(p, p) and g(¬p, p) in terms of equivalence. Thus, the content of
(S1.3) boils down to:
∀g, p [g(p, p) ∧g(¬p, p) ≡∀qg(q, p)]
which is a version of a principle of bivalence, because it intuitively speaking says
that if something holds of a sentence and of its negation, it holds of all sentences.29
All systems under discussion, allow for conditional proofs: to prove a condi-
tional, or its universal generalization, one can assume the antecedent and derive the
consequent. Also, it is taken for granted that to prove a universal generalization of a
formula it is enough to prove the formula itself. These rules were not listed explicitly,
but observe that rules (α)-(γ ) listed below do not contain any quantiﬁer introduction
rule.30 And indeed, the moves in question were used without any additional explana-
tion by Le´sniewski and his students, starting already with Tarski (1923). Apart from
that, S1 employed six rules of inference, all of them originally named by a Greek
letter:
(α) Detachment for equivalence.
(β) Substitution: this works almost like universal quantiﬁer elimination in natural deduction
systems. From ∀ζ φ it allows one to infer the expression resulting from substituting in φ for
all occurrences of ζ (free in φ) a simple expression of the language (a constant or a variable)
given that no substituted variable becomes bound. The rule applies to propositional variables
and functor variables as well.
(γ ) Distribution: let all free variables in χ be ζ1, . . . , ζk, and let all free variables in ψ
be ζk+1, . . . , ζm. From ∀ζ1, . . . , ζm (χ ≡ψ) infer ∀ζ1, . . . , ζk χ ≡∀ζk+1, . . . , ζm ψ. An
analogous rule pertains to universal quantiﬁers binding functor variables.
29 Le´sniewski, partially due to his criticism of Łukasiewicz and Kotrabi´nski’s attempts to make
sense of a third logical value, denied the philosophical plausibility of many-valued logics.
30 “Le´sniewski never published technical directives for his method, as Gentzen and Ja´skowski did
for theirs in 1934-35, since he presented his intuitive deductions only as outlines demonstrating
how to construct rigorous proofs according to his ofﬁcial directives.” (Luschei 1962, 40)

Le´sniewski’s Protothetic
(δ) Deﬁnition(ofapropositionalconstant):τζ1,...,ζk ≡χ isadeﬁnitionofanewlyintroduced
propositional constant τ of category s with possible parameters ζ1, . . . , ζk iff χ is a well-
formed formula with ζ1, . . . , ζk as the only free variables. If τ does not contain parameters,
χ cannot contain any free variables.
(ε) Deﬁnition (of a protothetical functor): Say μ1, . . . , μv, ζ1, . . . , ζk are variables of cat-
egories σ1, . . . , σv, σ ′
1, . . . , σ ′
k. Then
∀μ1, . . . , μv, ζ1, . . . , ζn (τμ1,...,μv(ζ1, . . . , ζn) ≡χ(μ1, . . . , μv, ζ1, . . . , ζn))
is a deﬁnition of a newly introduced k-place functor τ of category
σ
σ ′
1,...,σ ′
k with parameters
μ1, . . . , μv iffμ1, . . . , μv, ζ1, . . . , ζn aretheonlyfreevariablesinχ(μ1, . . . , μv, ζ1, . . . , ζk)
(non-primitive expressions cannot occur in wffs unless they are earlier deﬁned). An impor-
tant aspect both of (δ) and of (ε) is that parameters do not contribute to the semantic category
of the newly deﬁned constant—we will see the importance of this fact in Sect.3.6.
(ζ) A rule concerning quantiﬁers. Originally it was formulated for a language with impli-
cation as the primitive symbol. No clear description of this rule exists in the sources. It was
supposed to move universal quantiﬁer from the front of a conditional to the front of the con-
sequent, given that no variable bound by this quantiﬁer occurred as free in the antecedent.
What we know is that Tarski in 1922 proved it to be dependent on the other rules and as such
redundant (so we do not need it anyway). (Srzednicki and Stachniak 1988, 22–23)
System S2
This system, described in (Le´sniewski 1929, 451–53), built over a richer language
than S1 (now, both variables of all types constructible from s, and quantiﬁers binding
them are allowed) is an extension of S1 by a rule dubbed the rule of veriﬁcation,
also called (η). It originates from the following idea due to Łukasiewicz. Say two
propositional constants are introduced:
0 ≡∀q q
1 ≡(∀q q ≡∀q q)
Take a formula φ whose all variables are propositional. Consider all possible sub-
stitutions of 0s and 1s for all propositional variables in φ. If they all are sentences
provable in S1, the universal generalization of φ is a theorem.
Le´sniewski introduced an analogous rule for semantic categories other than s. For
any semantic category σ there is a speciﬁc set of all possible extensional constants
S (called veriﬁers of that category) such that for any formula φ if all results of
substitution of free variables of category σ by elements of S are provable in S1, then
the formula φ preceded by universal quantiﬁers binding these variables is a theorem
of S2.
For instance, for the semantic category s, the veriﬁers are 1 and 0, as deﬁned above.
For
s
s,s veriﬁers are constituted by all 16 truth-functional connectives. In general the
veriﬁers of a given semantic category are all (up to logical equivalence) differently
deﬁned constants of that category. Le´sniewski provided a detailed explanation of how

3.5 Axiomatic Formulations
75
a complete list of deﬁnitions of veriﬁers of any speciﬁc category is to be produced
(since this is not intrinsically complex, let us not elaborate on the details).
One thing worth observing is that even though this rule is quite intuitive, proofs
employing higher-order quantiﬁers become quite lengthy. For instance, to prove
∀f, p (¬ f (p) ∨f (p)) one has to prove four other formulas:
∀p (¬¬p ∨¬p)
∀p (¬ass(p) ∨ass(p))
∀p (¬ver(p) ∨ver(p))
∀p (¬ f al(p) ∨f al(p)).
This was one of the reasons why the rule was abandoned in later systems.
Note that Le´sniewski did not want rule (η) to allow the introduction of universal
quantiﬁers binding propositional variables. In his formulation, the rule (1) describes
the deﬁnitions of all veriﬁers of a certain category other than s and (2) allows one to
introduce ∀ζ φ(ζ) if all instances resulting from the substitution of veriﬁers of the
same category as ζ for ζ in φ(ζ) have been proven. A likely reason why this rule
excluded the case of a universal quantiﬁer binding a propositional variable is that
this would make the rule partially redundant. Other rules handle quantiﬁers binding
propositional variables sufﬁciently: it turns out that if an expression can be proved
by applying (η) to propositional variables, then it is already provable in S1.
System S3
The system (Le´sniewski 1929, 454–464) resulted from the fact that the formulation of
(η) is somewhat lengthy and so are proofs employing this rule. Le´sniewski proposed
a rule of extensionality, called (η⋆) which turns out to do the same job as (η). The
rule says that for any one-place functor of at least second order the corresponding
law of extensionality (to be deﬁned below) is a theorem. To formulate the law of
extensionality for higher-order functors we have to go through a few deﬁnitions.
Deﬁnition 3.3 (Order of a functor) The order of a functor is deﬁned by two condi-
tions:
• Every functor all arguments of which belong to the category of propositions is a
ﬁrst-order functor.
• Every functor at least one argument of which is of order k −1 and no argument is
of order k or higher, is k-order.
□
Deﬁnition 3.4 (Higher-order equivalence) 0-order equivalence is just material
equivalence. First-order equivalence of sentential connectives is deﬁned by:
∀f,g,p1,...,pk(( f .= g) ≡( f (p1, . . . , pk) ≡g(p1, . . . , pk)))

76
3
Le´sniewski’s Protothetic
Various kinds of equivalence between expressions of the same category σ are deﬁned
according to the following schema:
(χ1 .=σ χ2) ≡∀ξ1, . . . , ξn (χ1(ξ1, . . . , ξn) .=σ ′ χ2(ξ1, . . . , ξn))
where χ1 and χ2 belong to category σ =
σ ′
σ1,...,σn and ξ1, . . . , ξn are variables of
categories (respectively) σ1, . . . , σn. That is, two functors of category σ =
σ ′
σ1,...,σn
are σ-equivalent iff applying them to the same arguments results in σ ′-equivalent
expressions.
Now, the rule of extensionality says that any instance of the following:
∀ζ1, ζ2, ζ [(ζ1 .=σ ζ2) →(ζ(ζ1) .=σ ′ ζ(ζ2))]
is a theorem, where ζ1, ζ2 are variables of category σ, and ζ is a higher-order functor
of category σ ′
σ . This reads: if two expressions ζ1 and ζ2 are σ-equivalent, then for
any one-place functor ζ of appropriate semantic category, the result of applying ζ to
ζ1 is σ ′-equivalent to the result of applying it to ζ2.
S3 employs the same axioms as S1 and the rules: (α), (β), (γ ), (δ), (ε) and (η⋆).
The system is equivalent to S2, and is a sound and complete with respect to the
classical semantics in which propositional variables range over two truth-values and
variables of other categories range over extensional functions of appropriate type.
System S4
This system, introduced in (Le´sniewski 1929, 456–459)31 is a conditional formula-
tion of S3 based on the following axioms:
(S4.1)∀p, q (p →(q →p))
(S4.2)∀p, q,r ((p →q) →((q →r) →(p →r)))
(S4.3)∀p, q,r (((p →q) →r) →((p →r) →r))
(S4.4)∀g, p, q (g(p, q) →(g(p →∀q q, p) →g(q, p)))
(S4.4) is quite interesting. Let us see what it says and why it is valid. It states
that for any two–place connective g, if g(p, q) is true and g(p →∀q q, p) (that is,
g(¬p, p), because ∀q q is disprovable) is true, then also g(q, p) is true. Why? Well,
Protothetic is a two–valued extensional logic. Hence, under any valuation q has to
be either (materially) equivalent to ¬p or to p. If it has the same truth–value as ¬p,
then we can substitute q for ¬p in g(¬p, p) and hence g(q, p). If, on the other hand,
q has the same truth value as p, we can substitute p for q in g(p, q) and so we get
g(p, p). But then, we also can substitute q for p and we get g(q, p) as well.
31 There, Le´sniewski described his formulation from year 1922.

3.5 Axiomatic Formulations
77
The rules of system S4 are:
(αI ) Detachment for implication: From φ →ψ and φ infer ψ.
(βI ) Substitution: just like (β), only for a language based on implication.
(γI )
Distribution: This is an intuitive correlate of (γ ). Let all free variables in χ be
ζ1, . . . , ζk, and let all free variables in ψ be ζk+1, . . . , ζm. From ∀ζ1, . . . , ζm (χ →ψ)
infer ∀ζ1, . . . , ζk χ →∀ζk+1, . . . , ζm ψ.
(δI ) and (ϵ1) Rules of deﬁnitions: they correspond to (δ) and (ϵ) and describe what deﬁnitions
in a language based on implication should look like. The only new thing is that instead of
material equivalence ‘φ ≡ψ’ such deﬁnitions employ logically equivalent longer formulas
built by means of material implication:
∀σ (((φ →ψ) →((ψ →φ) →σ)) →σ)
where σ is a propositional variable which is free neither in φ nor in ψ.
(ζI ) A conditional formulation of (ζ).
(ηI ⋆)
A conditional formulations of (η⋆) (analogously, another variant of the system is
obtained if instead of (η⋆) a conditional version of (η) is employed).
Later (1922–1923), this system was simpliﬁed. The ﬁrst important simpliﬁcation
is due to Tarski ( see Lesniewski 1929, 459), who (1) suggested writing deﬁnitions in
the form of two separate implications, and (2) showed that then it will sufﬁce to use
((S4.1)) and the following axiom of veriﬁcation instead of all the above axioms:
∀f, p, q,r ( f (r, p) →( f (r, p →∀s s) →f (r, q)))
System S5
This is the ﬁnal form of Protothetic. It results from a slight modiﬁcation of S3—the
rule of deﬁnitions now puts deﬁnienda on the right side of the equivalence and not
on the left. The difference is that this makes proofs slightly shorter, because it allows
one to apply universal quantiﬁer distribution and detachment to deﬁnitions without
employing the theorem stating that equivalence is symmetric.
3.6 Some Theorems and Proofs
Now, let us take a look at some theorems and proofs in Protothetic.32 First, to get
the hang of the expressive power of the language of Protothetic, let us take a look
at a few theorems of full Protothetic. We will focus on properties of connectives of
category s
s (analogous theorems for other semantic categories also exist).
32 This section is based on (Słupecki 1953). My modiﬁcations consist in selecting the material to
be included, adding natural language explanations, ﬁlling in some proof details, and re-arranging
the proof layout.

Le´sniewski’s Protothetic
∀f, p, q ((p ≡q) →( f (p) ≡f (q)))
(3.1)
(3.1) is the law of extensionality for 1-place connectives. It says that substitution of
materially equivalent arguments in the scope of such connectives does not change
the value of the whole expression.
∀f (∀p ( f (p) ≡ass(p)) ∨∀p( f (p) ≡ver(p)) ∨∀p( f (p) ≡f al(p)) ∨∀p( f (p) ≡¬p))
(3.2)
(3.2) is the law of the number of functions. It says that a 1-place connective is
equivalent to one of the four connectives deﬁned before: ass(p), ver(p), f al(p),
¬p.
∀f, p ( f (p) ≡( f (1) ∧p ∨f (0) ∧¬p))
(3.3)
(3.3) is called the law of development. It says that any f (p), when p is true, is
equivalent to f (1), and is equivalent to f (0) otherwise.
∀f, p ( f (1) ∧f (0) →f (p))
(3.4)
(3.4) is the law of veriﬁcation for 1-place s
s connectives. It says that if both f (1) and
f (0) are true, so is f (p) for any p.
As it turns out, none of (3.1–3.4) is S1-provable, and all of them are pairwise
S1-equivalent—that is, their equivalence can be proven in Protothetic even with-
out the use of the rule of veriﬁcation and the rule of extensionality. Of particular
importance is the S1-equivalence of (3.1) and (3.4), because a generalization of the
equivalence proof yields the result that veriﬁcation and extensionality over the lan-
guage of Protothetic have the same logical strength. This, of course, means that S2
(based on the rule of veriﬁcation) and S3 (based on the rule of extensionality) are
indeed equivalent, as indicated before.
Thus, to give a taste of what proofs in Protothetic look like, we will concentrate on
proving the equivalence of the law of veriﬁcation (3.4) and the law of extensionality
(3.1). We will work within the implicational system S4. Since we want to prove an
S1-equivalence, (η) and (η⋆) will not be used in these proofs.
One move that was practiced both by Le´sniewski and by Le´sniewskian scholars
is the use of additional assumptions and conditional proofs (this is one reason to
think that Le´sniewski was one of the pioneers of natural deduction). Thus, if one
wants to prove a conditional φ →ψ or its universal generalization (the result of
preceding it with a universal quantiﬁer binding all free variables), it is enough to
assume φ and derive ψ. We will allow ourselves to employ this strategy too.33 Also,
I will help myself to the mainstream method of writing natural deduction proofs
Fitch-style. (The original style consisted rather in just listing the formulas and giving
the formula numbers on which they depended.)
Recall the axioms of S4. Let’s see what we can prove from them.
33 Natural deduction methods were in early stage of their development, so Le´sniewski and his
students helped themselves to some of those techniques without explicitly describing them.

3.6 Some Theorems and Proofs
79
Theorem 3.5 (S4.1), (S4.2), (S4.3) ⊢S1 ∀p, q (((p →q) →p) →p). That is,
formula:
(S4.3′)
∀p, q (((p →q) →p) →p)
can be proved from these axioms using the rules available in S1.
Proof
1
(p →q) →p
Assumption
2
((p →q) →p) →((p →p) →p)
Sub p/r: (S4.3)
3
(p →p) →p
MP: 1, 2
4
p
Assumption
5
p →p
Discharge: 4 ⇒4
6
p
MP: 3, 5
To prove a generalized conditional we assume its antecedent in line 1. Line two
is obtained by substituting p for r in (S4.3). Detachment (also known as Modus
Ponens, hence MP) applied to line 1 and 2 yields line 3. To prove p →p it is enough
to assume p in line 4, observe that it directly follows from itself and discharge this
assumption in line 5. Then, MP applied to lines 3 and 5 gives us p, which ends the
proof.
The reason why (S4.3′) is interesting is that once universal quantiﬁers are
dropped, (S4.1), (S4.2) and (S4.3′) together give us the Tarski-Bernays axiom-
atization of the purely implicational classical calculus (as its name indicates, the
axiomatization was formulated by Łukasiewicz (1929). Theorem 3.5 is good news
because since we know that Tarski-Bernays axiomatization is complete for the purely
implicational calculus, so is the purely implicational part of (S1) (by the way, since
we know the Tarski-Bernays axiomatization is complete, we also know that (S4.1),
(S4.2),((S4.3′)) ⊢S1 (S4.3). This also means that henceforth we will be able to
rely on (S4.3′) (in general, in proofs we can use previously proven theorems).
The next question is what happens once we take the universal generalization
of the implicational axioms and add the Tarski-style deﬁnition of negation (¬p
means p →∀p p). Can we derive all classical propositional theorems that can be
formulated using negation and implication? To ﬁx ideas, take an axiomatization of
the full classical calculus (again, Łukasiewicz’s):
[Ł1] ∀p ((¬p →p) →p)
[Ł2] ∀p, q (p →(¬p →q))
Theorem 3.6 Both claims hold:
(S4.1), (S4.2), (S4.3) ⊢S1 [Ł1]
(S4.1), (S4.2), (S4.3)] ⊢(S1) [Ł2]

Le´sniewski’s Protothetic
Proof
For the ﬁrst claim, we will use (S4.3′):
1
((p →∀p p) →p) →p
Sub ∀p p/q : (SS4.3′)
2
(¬p →p) →p
Def ¬: 1
Line one is obtained from (S4.3′) by substituting ∀p p forq. Line 2 just follows by
deﬁnition of negation. The fact that I substituted a complex expression in line 1 might
seem worrying, given that Le´sniewski originally only allowed for substitution of
simple expressions. This, however, is not a problem, because substitution of complex
expressions is handled in Protothetic by the rule of substitution together with the rules
of deﬁnitions. Thus, instead of substitution ∀p p, I could ﬁrst deﬁne ⊥as ∀p p, then
substitute ⊥for q in (S4.3′), and then use the deﬁnition of ⊥to derive line 1. Since
this only makes proofs longer without providing any more insight into their structure,
from now on I will apply substitution to complex expressions without apology.
For the second claim, consider the following proof:
1
p
Assumption
2
p →∀p p
Assumption
3
∀p p
MP: 1, 2
4
q
Sub q/p: 3
5
(p →∀p p) →q
Discharge: 2⇒4
6
p →((p →∀p p) →q)
Discharge: 1⇒5
7
p →(¬p →q)
Def¬: 6
To prove line 7, by deﬁnition, it is enough to prove line 6. So we assume its
antecedent in line 1 and aim at proving its consequent in line 5. But that consequent
is an implication itself. So we assume its antecedent in line 2 and try to prove its
consequent in line 4. MP applied to 1 and 2 gives us line 3, and plain substitution
applied to line 3 gives us the desired result in line 4.
This tells us that we have (the universal generalization of) the whole classical
logic at our disposal. From now on I will just apply a generic rule called CL to mean
that something follows by the classical logic, without explaining how this is to be
proven using the axioms and primitive rules of the system.
Now, our goal is a proof of the equivalence of extensionality and veriﬁcation for
1-place sentence connectives. That is, we will be trying to prove:
[VerEx] ∀f, p, q ((p ≡q) →( f (p) ≡f (q))) ≡∀f, p ( f (1) ∧f (0) →f (p))
Theorem 3.7 (S4.1), (S4.2), (S4.2) ⊢S1 [V er Ex].

⇐: Now it’s time for a constant with a parameter to come to the rescue. We will
deﬁne a constant p which contains a variable in its subscript, and yet is a one-place
constant forming expressions like p(q):
[Defp] ∀p, q [p(q) ≡∀f ((p ≡q) →( f (p) ≡f (q)))]
From now on I will not only help myself to (universal generalizations of) classical
propositional theorems, but also to standard classical treatment of quantiﬁers (any
such move will be marked by ‘CL∀’). Now, we will need a few claims:
Lemma 3.1 All of the following are S1-provable from (S4.1), (S4.2) and (S4.3):
(a)
0(1)
(b)
0(0)
(c)
1(1)

The key moves are in lines 2, 3 and 8, where we substitute a deﬁned constant with
a parameter for a one-place variable. This is the ﬁrst way deﬁnitions in Le´sniewski’s
systems can help prove theorems. In this case, a deﬁnition allowed us to prove

3.6 Some Theorems and Proofs
83
something about a relation between p and q by means of a claim about 1-place
connectives.
This ends our short tour around protothetical proofs. One important thing to notice
is that the rule of extensionality is formulated for one-place functors. The trick we
used above can be generalized to prove that together with the rules of deﬁnitions, the
rule of extensionality is strong enough to prove extensionality for n-ary functors of
arbitrary semantic category, for any ﬁnite n. There is also another way deﬁnitions in
Le´sniewski’s systems provide proofs with extra power, but its discussion will have
to wait till Chap.6.
3.7 Further Readings
Historically speaking, Protothetic was preceded by certain suggestions concerning
propositional quantiﬁcation. Russel (1906) suggested introducing quantiﬁers bind-
ing the propositional variables, but he did not develop this idea. Łukasiewicz (1929)
developed a calculus where quantiﬁers binding propositional variables play an impor-
tant part (see also Łukasiewicz and Tarski 1930), but it seems that the generality that
Protothetic can afford was Le´sniewski’s idea. The very ﬁrst paper related to Proto-
thetic which employs quantiﬁcation not only over propositional variables but also
over variables representing connectives is Tarski (1923, reprinted in Srzednicki and
Stachniak 1998), where it was shown that when this sort of generality is admitted,
conjunction can be deﬁned in terms of equivalence as the only connective. Tarski’s
resultsonfunctionalcompletenessofPrototheticwereextendedbySoboci´nski(1949,
reprinted in Srzednicki and Stachniak 1998), who generalized Tarski’s considerations
concerning forms of deﬁnitions in Protothetic. Soboci´nski’s paper is also interesting
for historical reasons—in the introduction he describes the fate of Collectanea Log-
ica, the Polish journal in which (Le´sniewski (1938a,b) were to appear. The outbreak
of war made its publication impossible.
The project of ﬁnding the shortest possible axiomatization of Protothetic, already
initiated by Le´sniewski, was continued not only by him but also by some of his
students for quite a few years. (Soboci´nski 1954, 1960, 1961) gives good surveys of
the results. The latter paper also contains an interesting metatheorem which states
a sufﬁcient condition for an axiomatization of Protothetic (although no proof of
its sufﬁciency is given). Soboci´nski also gave another, slightly more complicated
version of sufﬁcient conditions for completeness, also without a proof (but with a
convincing explanation). Le Blanc (1985) provides another, shorter version of the
axiomatization.
One of the best introductions to Protothetic so far is Słupecki (1953). The formu-
lations that Słupecki focuses on are mainly conditional. His explanations of the rules
of inference are somewhat brief, but he provides many examples of simple proofs
which allow the reader to get an idea as to what rules he is using. In one aspect his
rules differ from those of Le´sniewski: he allows for substitution of complex expres-
sions in place of variables of appropriate semantic categories, which was forbidden

Le´sniewski’s Protothetic
in the original formulation (this move, however, is conservative). A nice feature of
Słupecki’s presentation is that he starts with relatively simple systems and goes on
to construct full Protothetic by gradual strengthening. Slupecki also discussed some
interesting theorems that can be formulated in the language elementary Protothetic,
which are also provably equivalent in elementary Protothetic (for one-place func-
tion symbols, at least, but a generalization of his results is to be found by Chikawa
(1967)). A sketch of a completeness proof is included.
Rickey (1972, 1973), provides a good insight into the nature of Le´sniewski’s ter-
minological explanations, with special attention to how the inscriptional description
of the rules of Protothetic is to be understood.
An interesting book (in French) intended as an introduction to Protothetic is
(Miéville 2001).
Le´sniewski’s idiosyncratic wheel-and-spoke notation is interesting for at least two
reasons: (1) symbols for propositional one- and two-place connectives encode their
truth-tables with their own shape, (2) geometric relations between different sym-
bols correspond to various logical relations between the functions that they express.
Recently it has been shown that there is a simple algorithm that extends this method
to arbitrary ﬁrst-order classical connectives (Urbaniak 2006).
A comprehensive monograph on intuitionistic Protothetic is (López-Escobar and
Miraglia 2002).
Another group of formulations of Protothetic, hinted at by Le´sniewski, is called
computative Protothetic and was the subject of a PhD thesis at the University of
Manchester (Le Blanc 1991). In the system there are signs for assertion and rejection,
and rules describe which formulas are asserted or rejected on the basis of what has
been previously asserted or rejected. The oldest system of computative Protothetic
and contains nine rules of inference and is based on one axiom: ‘A :  →’
(where  is the falsum constant and A means assertion). Le Blanc describes sixteen
equivalent formulations, based on ten different combinations of primitive terms. He
reconstructs those systems and provides a detailed description of their rules. Also,
sketches of consistency, completeness and equivalence proofs are given.
An interesting research direction is many-valued Protothetics. Those have been
studied (and a completeness result has been given) by Scharle (1971). It turns out
that ﬁnitely-valued Protothetic can be axiomatized with the following property: for
every closed wff φ one of Ji(φ) is provable, where Ji is a function that takes one of
the designated values only if its argument has value i. The full proof of this fact can
be given using a technique developed by Surma (1976) which uses ﬁnitely generated
trees. Many-valued Protothetics have been the subject of a PhD dissertation at the
University of Manchester, supervised by Lejewski (Watanabe 1973). As Watanabe
has shown, the change in the number of admissible values results in the possibility
of introducing different general quantiﬁers of one and the same semantic category,
corresponding to different conjunctions one can introduce in a many-valued system.
There is a connection between Protothetic and Henkin’s theory of propositional
types (Henkin 1950, 1963), which was an improvement of the system of Church
(1940). (Andrews (1963) constitutes an improvement of Henkin’s theory). Minor

3.7 Further Readings
85
details aside, Henkin’s theory of propositional types can be thought of as a version
of Protothetic.
Grzegorczyk (1964) shows that every one of Henkin’s equality symbols is deﬁn-
able by mean of relational abstraction and the equality symbol for the usual material
equivalence (although still the set of axioms is denumerable). Meridth (1951) pro-
vides also a similar system, commented on by Arai and Tanaka (1966).
Propositional calculi become more complex when we admit non-extensional oper-
ators. One of the intuitive steps is to introduce an identity operator which expresses
something like ‘expresses the same proposition’ or ‘states the same fact’. If the cri-
teria of identity are more ﬁne-grained than in Frege’s account (according to which
the denotation of any two sentences having the same truth value is the same), we
get non-extensional calculi. Zero-order calculi with additional axioms and rules for
identity, called Sentential Calculi with Identity (SCI), have been extensively stud-
ied by Suszko (1966, 1967, 1971a,b,c,d,e,f, 1972a,b, 1973, 1975, 1977) and devel-
oped by Omyła (1994). Apparently quite independently, following a suggestion of
Prior (1957), Cresswell constructed a second-order theory of intensional identity.
Besides the difference of level, in Suszko’s system identity is a primitive sym-
bol introduced axiomatically, whereas in Cresswell’s system identity is deﬁned by:
‘p = q ≡∀f ( f (p) ≡f (q))’ where functor variables are allowed to range over
non-extensional functors as well. The question of the relation between Cresswell’s
and Suszko’s systems has not been fully explored. Also, Suszko at one point sug-
gests that Protothetic would have been much more interesting if it had admitted the
intensional identity. No such extension of Protothetic has been constructed so far.
Another fascinating issue seems to be the relation between intensional identity and
modalities. In his papers Suszko also shows how in some systems with identity as the
only primitive non-extensional system it is possible to obtain various modal calculi.

Chapter 4
Le´sniewski’s Ontology
Abstract After describing basic intuitions underlying the system, I brieﬂy point
out how it differs from the classical logic. (The main difference is that there is no
distinction between predicates and singular terms: there is only one class of name
variables, and names can refer to any number of objects.) Then, I describe its language
and its original axiomatization. I give some examples of deﬁnitions in Ontology to
highlight the ﬂexibility of its language. Next, I discuss Le´sniewski’s argument against
universals formulated in the language of Ontology, the relation between Ontology
and Russell’s description theory and Le´sniewski’s attempt to apply Ontology to a
paradox concerned with four-dimensional objects. Secondary literature pertaining to
Ontology is surveyed in the last section.
4.1 Ontology: Basic Intuitions
The ﬁrst remark on Ontology, a logical system developed by Le´sniewski, dates back
to his introduction to “On the Foundations of Mathematics”. Ontology is a second
layer of his systems. The ﬁrst layer, Protothetic, was concerned with propositional
aspectsofreasoning,widelyunderstood.Thesecondlayerextendsthisbyintroducing
a category of names (and other derivative categories) and a predication copula: ε .
Le´sniewski says that Ontology…
…forms a certain kind of modernized ‘traditional logic’, and which in content and ‘power’
most nearly approaches the Schröder ‘Klassenkalkül’, considered as including the theory of
‘individuals’. (Le´sniewski 1927,176)
The ﬁrst axiomatization of Ontology1 Le´sniewski claims to have formulated while
teaching a course ‘Exercises in the domain of the Cantorian Theory of Sets’ at War-
saw University in 1919/1920 (Le´sniewski 1931,367). The ﬁrst ofﬁcial presentation
1 All other formulations of Ontology consist in replacing the axiom of Ontology with another,
provably equivalent axiom (or axioms).

Le´sniewski’s Ontology
of Ontology was Le´sniewski’s lecture in Warsaw on January 10, 1921, titled ‘On
the principles of Ontology’ at the scientiﬁc session of the Polish Association for
Psychology (Le´sniewski 1931,369).
Although Ontology is mostly concerned with predication, it differs from the clas-
sical predicate logic in a few respects. First of all, it introduces terms, but it makes
no distinction between names and predicates. In this respect, it follows traditional
syllogistics rather than the predicate calculus. In Ontology there is only one category
of names, no matter whether they are empty, singular or common terms. So, a wide
understanding of the word name is accepted here. A name is any expression that
may take the place of either M or N in a sentence of the form: M is N. Or, in other
words, all countable categorematic (as opposed to syncategorematic) expressions
that are not sentences are taken to be names. Some examples of names in this wide
understanding are:a cat, Socrates, brown, the bald guy in the corner, unicorn. Thus,
by including the case when a name does not refer, Le´sniewski’s logic is one of the
ﬁrst formalized free logics.2 The main motivation for this move is the same as stan-
dard motivations for free logics: one wants logic to be applicable to our discourse
independently of often empirical question whether the names used refer to anything
(and whether they refer to one or more objects).
Le´sniewski’s Ontology can be viewed as an extension of name calculus in the
wide sense of the word ‘name’ mentioned above. ‘Name calculus’ because the basic
speciﬁc variables (a, b, c, d, . . .) that are used in Ontology are name variables (this
does not mean that no variables of other categories are used). Roughly speaking, an
intuitive way to think of name variables is that they correspond to possible countable
noun phrases or that they represent ways in which a name can refer. ‘An extension’
because the language also contains variables of higher categories, insofar as those
categories can be “built” by combining categories of names and of sentences.
Another respect in which Ontology differs from standard ﬁrst-order logic is that
it represents predication in a different way than ﬁrst order languages. Besides quan-
tiﬁers3 and classical propositional connectives, Ontology has another primitive sym-
bol, the epsilon connective ε (read as ‘is’ or ‘is one of’). An expression of the form
aεb is read as ‘a is b’ (or ‘a is one of b’s’) and it is true if and only if a is taken to be
a singular term that names an object which is among the objects named by b. So, the
following are true: Socrates ε philosopher, The book on my desk ε Kleene’s ‘Intro-
duction to Metamathematics’, and the following turn out to be false (although still
well-formed): ‘Unicorn ε animal’, ‘elephant ε animal’. Some examples of the ren-
dering of simple quantiﬁed statements: ‘some philosophers are mad’ (‘some b is c’)
has the form ∃a (a ε b ∧a ε c) and ‘all mad people think they are philosophers’ (‘all
b are c’) becomes something like ∀a (a ε b →a ε c). 4
2 A free logic is a logic which holds also in empty domains. A free logic is supposed to avoid the
ontological commitment of other systems. For instance, standard ﬁrst order logic requires that the
domain should contain at least one object.
3 Historically speaking, Le´sniewski used only the universal quantiﬁer.
4 However, it is possible that natural language quantiﬁcation is ambiguous. So, for example, a
universal statement with existential import should be rather rendered as ’∀a (a ε b →a ε c) ∧
∃c c ε a’.

4.1 Ontology: Basic Intuitions
91
Third, in Ontology quantiﬁers are not meant to carry ontological commitment. It
is the use of ε by which existence is stated. So, existence is deﬁned:
∀a (ex(a) ≡∃b bεa)
(4.1)
and it is provable in Ontology that for some a, a does not exist:
∃a ¬ex(a)
(4.2)
This and similar facts raised a fairly complex debate about the interpretation of
Le´sniewski’s quantiﬁers and the meaning of variables in his systems. For it is not
clear how they are to be interpreted given Le´sniewski’s nominalism and the fact that
he did not provide a semantics for his system. For now, I will ignore these problems,
but I will list related literature in Sect.4.9 and discuss the issue in Chap. 8.
4.2 The Language of Ontology
The notion of semantic category as applied to Ontology is pretty much the same
as the notion which we already know from Sect. 3.2. What is new in comparison
to Protothetic is that expressions of the category of names (n) are introduced, and
expressions of categories that can be built from s’s and n’s are allowed, pretty much
as in Protothetic we allowed categories built from s’s only (see Deﬁnition 3.1 on p.
60).
All (atomic) formulas of type a ε b are of category s. All terms are of category n.
Any expression which with k arguments of categories σ1, . . . , σn yields an expression
of category σ is of category
σ
σ1···σn . For instance, ε takes two arguments, both of
category n and forms an expression of category s. Thus, its category is
s
nn .
The language of Ontology arises from a generalization parallel to that of
Protothetic: for any semantic category of Ontology, constants (possibly with parame-
ters) can be deﬁned, and variables together with quantiﬁers binding those variables
can be introduced.
Deﬁnition 4.1 Ontology is constructed in a language determined by the following5:
• a, b, c, d, e, possibly with numerical subscripts are nominal variables, of category
n.6
5 This is not exactly the language that Le´sniewski used, but (granted the slightly Platonic approach)
it has all the properties essential for the further development. Section 6.4 is devoted to a brief
explanation of the speciﬁc aspects of Le´sniewski’s meta-logic.
6 Le´sniewski used unofﬁcial notation in which a name variable in a formula was written in capital
letter if the satisfaction of that formula required the uniqueness of the referent for that variable.
Since I rather prefer a streamlined syntax which does not depend on model-theoretic properties of
formulas, I will not follow Le´sniewski on this.

92

Le´sniewski’s Ontology
• The language of Protothetic is a sub-language of the language of Ontology. That
is, any formation rule that holds for Protothetic, hold also for Ontology and every
well–formed formula of Protothetic is a well–formed formula of Ontology.
• ε is a primitive symbol of category
s
nn .
• For any deﬁned constant (possibly with parameters) of category
τ
σ1···σn (rules of
deﬁnitions are given below),7 there also are variables of that category, f
τ
σ1···σn ,
g
τ
σ1···σn ,possiblywithnumericalsubscripts.Inpractice,thesuperscriptsareomitted
when the semantic category is obvious from the context.8
• If φ is of category
τ
σ1···σn and expressions α1, . . . , αn are of categories σ1, . . . , σn,
then φ(α1, . . . , αn) is a well-formed expression of the language of Ontology of
category τ.
• If φ is an expression of category s and ζ a variable of any category, then ∀ζ φ is a
well-formed formula of category s.

4.3 The Axiomatic System
Ontology, in its version from 1920 as described by Le´sniewski9 in his(Le´sniewski
1931, 364–369), has a single axiom:10
∀a, b [a ε b ≡∃c (c ε a) ∧∀c, d (c ε a ∧d ε a →c ε d) ∧∀c (c ε a →c ε b)]
This axiom says that for any a and b, a is b iff (1) for some c, c is a, (2) for any c
and d, if c is a and d is a, then c is d, and (3) for any c, if c is a,then c is also b.
The intended interpretation of ε11 is that a ε b is true if and only if there is exactly
one object which is a, and this object is among the objects which are b (this includes
the case where b names exactly one object). Accordingly, (1) is supposed to guarantee
the non-emptiness of a, (2) is intended to express the requirement that a names at
most one object, and (3) is meant to state the inclusion between a and b (‘any object
which is a, is b’).
7 Le´sniewski did not have a speciﬁed list of constants. Rather, he invented symbols ad hoc as he
went. Sometimes he took symbols from the language of set theory which had similar meaning,
sometimes he took abbreviations of Latin words, sometimes he used Greek capital letters, but there
does not seem to be any deep uniformity in his choice of constant symbols.
8 This is not Le´sniewski’s original device. His main tool was introducing different shapes of brackets
surrounding the arguments.
9 There are various other axiomatizations, see Sect. 4.9 for references.

That is, the quantiﬁer elimination and introduction procedures are just an extension
of classical rules to variables of higher categories. Besides there are a few speciﬁc
rules, especially connected with deﬁnitions and introduction of variables of different
semantic categories.
Any deﬁnition of a constant name expression of category n (possibly with para-
meters ζ1, . . . , ζk) has the form:
∀a [a ε ζ1,...,ζk ≡a ε a ∧φ(ζ1, . . . , ζk)]
where ζ1,...,ζk is the deﬁned term and φ is a formula with a and ζ1, . . . , ζk as its
only free variables.
Protothetical deﬁnitions: for any variables α1, . . . , αk of semantic categories
σ1, . . . , σk and any formula β with α1, . . . , αk (and possibly ζ1, . . . , ζu) as its only
free variables, there are constants τ, τ ′ of categories
s
σ1···σk and
n
σ1···σk (possibly with
parameters ζ1, . . . , ζu), the former introduced by the universal closure of (4.3), the
latter introduced by the universal closure of (4.4).

l ) . . . (χσm
1 , . . . , χσm
n ) ≡β
12 Originally,the rules for quantiﬁers and propositional inference were a trivial extension (to quan-
tiﬁcation over variables of different categories) of the rules employed in Protothetic, see Chap. 3
for details.

94

Le´sniewski’s Ontology
Finally, the (two-fold) rule of extensionality is:
• If α and β are nominal variables and γ is a nominal variable distinct from them
both, any formula of the form:
∀γ [γ ε α ≡γ ε β] →∀χ [χ(α) ≡χ(β)]
is a theorem (where χ is a variable of category s
n ).
• Further, suppose:
– τ 1 and τ 2 are constants of category σ =
s
σ1···σk , (possibly with parameters
ζ1, . . . , ζu),
– τ 1′ and τ 2′ are constants of category σ ′ =
n
σ1···σk , (possibly with parameters
ζ1, . . . , ζu),
– α1, . . . , αk are distinct variables of categories σ1, . . . , σk,
– ζs is a variable of category s
σ ,
– ζn is a variable of category s
σ ′ ,
Then all instances of the following two schemata are theorems:
∀ζ1, . . . , ζu, α1, . . . , αk [τ 1
ζ1,...,ζu(α1, . . . , αk) ≡τ 2
ζ1,...,ζu(α1, . . . , αk)] →
→∀ζs, ζ1, . . . , ζu [ζs(τ 1
ζ1,...,ζu) ≡ζs(τ 2
ζ1,...,ζu)]
∀ζ1, . . . , ζu, α1, . . . , αk [a ε τ 1′
ζ1,...,ζu(α1, . . . , αk) ≡a ε τ 2′
ζ1,...,ζu(α1, . . . , αk)] →
→∀ζn, ζ1, . . . , ζu [ζn(τ 1′
ζ1,...,ζu) ≡ζn(τ 2′
ζ1,...,ζu)]
Roughly speaking, the rule of extensionality says that if two names refer to the
same things, or two functors apply to the same arguments, then whatever is true of
one of them, is also true of the other.
4.4 Some Examples of Deﬁnitions in Ontology
To appreciate the ﬂexibility of the language of Ontology, let us take a look at some
examples of deﬁnitions that can be built within its language. Coextensiveness is
deﬁned by:
∀a, b (◦(a, b) ≡∀c (c ε a ≡cεb))
Sometimes it is simpler to use the inﬁx notation (e.g. to write ‘a ◦b’ instead of
‘◦(a, b)’). Obviously, ◦is13 symmetric, reﬂexive and transitive:
13 In the context where I describe theorems of Ontology (or theorems of Mereology) I will just say
‘it is true’ or ‘holds’, still meaning ‘it is provable from the axioms of the system under consideration
using its rules’.

4.4 Some Examples of Deﬁnitions in Ontology
95
∀a, b (a ◦b ≡b ◦a)
∀a a ◦a
∀a, b, c (a ◦b ∧b ◦c →a ◦c)
The existence of a’s (‘there is at least one a’) is deﬁned by:
∀a (ex(a) ≡∃b b ε a)
‘ex’ is of semantic category s
n . We can also introduce variables and quantiﬁcation
for that category. Using the rule of extensionality we can easily prove that14:
∀a, b (a ◦b →∀f
s
n ( f
s
n (a) ≡f
s
n (b))
(4.5)
We can also deﬁne inclusion between two expressions of category s
n :
∀f, g [ f ⊆g ≡∀a ( f (a) →g(a))]
(4.6)
Reﬂexivity and transitivity for ⊆thus deﬁned hold.
Boolean operations on expressions (union, intersection, difference) of category s
n
can be deﬁned as well.
∀a, f, g [ f ∪g(a) ≡f (a) ∨g(b)]
∀a, f, g [ f ∩g(a) ≡f (a) ∧g(b)]
∀a, f, g [ f −g(a) ≡f (a) ∧¬g(a)]
(Note that in the above we are dealing with complex functors ‘ f ∪g’, ‘ f ∩g’, ‘ f −g’
applied to a single argument a, not with the union of f and g(a) etc.)
We can ‘climb’ up the ladder of semantic categories. For instance, we can deﬁne
non-emptiness of a s
n -expression, in the way analogous to that used for deﬁning
existence.
∀f [ex( f ) ≡∃a f (a)]
The functor ex
ssn deﬁned this way is an example of an expression of the category
s
s
n .
We can deﬁne generalized Boolean operations on expressions of category s
n . For
instance, the intersection of all names of which f is truly predicable can be deﬁned
by:
∀f, a [a ε ∩( f ) ≡∀b ( f (b) →a ε b)]
14 Basically because a ◦b means ∀c (c ε a ≡c ε b) so (4.5) results from an instance of the rule of
extensionality pretty much by deﬁnition of ◦.

96
4
Le´sniewski’s Ontology
Similar deﬁnitions are available for other operations and other categories. For
instance, ◦for two expressions of category
s
nn would be deﬁned15:
∀f, g ( f ◦g ≡∀a, b ( f (a, b) ≡g(a, b))
For a functor f of category s
nn we can easily deﬁne the domain d( f ) and range r( f )
of it:
∀f, a [d( f )(a) ≡∃b f (a, b)]
∀f, a [r( f )(a) ≡∃b f (b, a)]
For any
s
nn -expression, its restriction to speciﬁc domains and ranges is introduced
by:
∀f, g, h, a, b [restr( f, g, h)(a, b) ≡f (a, b) ∧g(a) ∧h(b)]
For any two-place functor we can deﬁne its reﬂexivity, transitivity, symmetry, anti-
symmetry. Thus we can also express the fact that it is a partial or well-ordering.
Pretty much all the standard notions can be introduced: ﬁrst, least, maximal, greatest
element of a given relation, least upper bounds, greatest lower bounds, chains etc.
(with respect to a restricted domain or not).
4.5 Against Universals, Revisited
As an example of how the language of Ontology may be used to formalize philo-
sophical arguments I will now describe one of Le´sniewski’s arguments against the
existence of universals.
(Le´sniewski (1927), p. 199) constructed an argument against the existence of
universals, very similar to the one from (Le´sniewski (1913), pp. 50–53).16 The dif-
ference is that it does not employ the notion of property and it does not employ
negative properties. In its original version it consists of one assumption and six con-
clusions following subsequently. Even though it is not formalized in Ontology, the
way it is phrased makes the formalization relatively easy. Here is Le´sniewski’s origi-
nal version. Just like his early argument against universals, this one starts with a very
speciﬁc assumption about abstract objects:
15 Mind that in our ofﬁcial notation the full form of this deﬁnition should be
∀f
s
n,n , g
s
n,n (◦
s
s
n,n , s
n,n ( f
s
n,n , g
s
n,n ) ≡∀a, b ( f
s
n,n (a, b) ≡g
s
n,n (a, b)))
16 The latter has been already discussed in Sect.2.9.

4.5 Against Universals, Revisited
97
However, in connection with that passage and with reference to all those who, by reason of
the meaning they give to expressions of the type ‘general object’17 with respect to objects
a,18 are inclined to state the proposition ‘if X is a general object with respect to objects a, X
is b and Y is a, then Y is b’,19 I wish to state here that this proposition entails the proposition
‘if there exist at least two different a, then a general object with respect to objects a does
not exist,’ in accordance with the following schema:
(1) If X is a general object with respect to objects a, X is b, [and] also Y is a, then Y is b.
(assumption)
(2) If X is a general object with respect to objects a, X is different from Z, and Z is a, then Z
is different from Z.
(3) If X is a general object with respect to objects a, X is identical with Z and Y is a, then Y
is identical with Z.
From (2) it follows that:
(4) If X is a general object with respect to objects a, and Z is a, then X is identical with Z.
(5) If X is a general object with respect to objects a, Z is a and Y is a, then (X is a general
object with respect to objects a, X is identical with Z, and Y is a).
From (5) and (3) it follows that:
(6) If X is a general object with respect to objects a, Z is a and Y is a, then Y is identical with
Z.
From (6) however it follows that if there exist at least two different a, then a general object
with respect to objects a does not exist.
Formalized reconstructions of the full argument have been given by Waragai
(1981) and Gryganiec (2000). I will sketch a simpliﬁed proof which starts with the
formalization of Le´sniewski’s assumption and ends with his ﬁnal conclusion.
Let us start with the assumption that if c is a general object with respect to objects
a and c is b, then any object d which is a is also b. The intuition here is pretty much
the same as the one behind Le´sniewski’s ﬁrst argument. We start with a bunch of
objects, all named by a name a, and formulate a necessary condition for an object, say
c, to be a general object with respect to those objects. Namely, whatever is predicable
of this general object should be predicable about any of the objects among a’s.
If we represent is using the epsilon, and treat ‘gen’ as a one-place functor which
with one name argument, say a, constructs a name gen(a) (‘The general objects with
respect to a’s’), this assumption may be formalized by:
∀a, b, c, d [c ε gen(a) →(c ε b →(d ε a →d ε b))]
(4.7)
17 By ‘general object’ Le´sniewski understood universals.
18 For instance, in this sense (at ﬁrst approximation), redness would be a general object with respect
to all red objects.
19 Le´sniewski informally used capital letters as name variables in formulas if the truth of a formula
required that only one object be assigned to a variable. So, instead of a, if the truth of a formula
requires that only one object is a, Le´sniewski would use a capital letter, like X, Y or Z. For the sake
of uniformity I do not use capital letters as name variables in the formalism.

Le´sniewski’s Ontology
The intended conclusion is that if c is a general object with respect to objects a, d is
a, and e is a, then d is identical with e, that is, there are no objects which are general
with respect to more than one object. We can formalize the claim as follows:
∀a, c, d, e [c ε gen(a) ∧d ε a ∧e ε a →d ε e ∧e ε d]
(4.8)
To give the proof of (4.8) from (4.7) we need two easy theorems of Ontology:
∀a, b (a ε b →a ε a)
(4.9)
∀a, b, c (a ε c ∧b ε c ∧c ε c →a ε b ∧b ε a)
(4.10)
I skip their proofs. A few words why the above holds, though. Observe that c ε c
guarantees that exactly one object is c. But if both the object which is a and the
object which is b are c, they have to be one and the same object. Now, let us prove
(4.8) from (4.7):

Le´sniewski’s comments:
I regard my treatment as the result of a careful formulation of theoretical tendencies involved,
more or less explicitly, in the argumentation of opponents of the different kinds of ‘universals’
in various phases of their ‘disputes’ about them. If one takes the position that this assertion is

4.5 Against Universals, Revisited
99
a banal one, I would cite in defence the circumstance that exponents of ‘philosophy’ defend,
regrettably often, positions at variance with banal assertions. (1927, 199)
The philosophical importance of the formal result is debatable. It may be equally
well taken to prove that if there are general objects (i.e. universals), they do not
satisfy (4.7). Indeed, a sensible proponent of universals is quite likely to deny that
if an object falls under a universal, it has all the properties that the universal does
(for instance, no concrete object is abstract even though any universal that it falls
under is).
4.6 Description Theory and Ontology
Recall that one of the basic theorems about Russell’s deﬁnite descriptions states:
A(ιx(B(x))) ≡∃y [∀z (B(z) ≡z = y) ∧A(y)]
(4.11)
(The only x which is B is A iff there is a y such that any z is B iff it is y, and y
is A.)
In Ontology, instead of things like ‘A(x)’ we rather have to say ‘b ε a’, where x
corresponds to b and A to a. Thus, we can recast (4.11) as20:
∀a, b [b ε a ≡∃c [∀d (d ε b ≡d = c) ∧c ε a]]
(4.12)
As it turns out (Hi˙z 1977), (4.12) is equivalent to one of the (many equivalent)
axioms of Ontology:
∀a, b [b ε a ≡∃c c ε b∧∀c (c ε b →c ε a)∧∀e, f (e ε b∧f ε b →e = f )] (4.13)
The equivalence proof is not too complicated, so as an example I will only give
it in one direction (4.11 ⇒4.13). To complete the proof we only need to show that
the right-hand side of (4.12) entails the right-hand side of (4.13):
20 Remember, ‘a = b’ stands here for ‘a ε b ∧b ε a’.

4.7 Time Slices and Ontology
Le´sniewski did not discuss three- or four–dimensionalism explicitly.21 Nor did he
consider time as a dimension while discussing mereology (which is understandable,
given that he meant mereology to underlie mathematics rather than some more elab-
orate metaphysical theories). However, at least at one spot one can see that he was
21 Three-dimensionalism is the view that what we naturally and primarily take to be objects are
things that have three spatial dimensions. Four-dimensionalism on the other hand claims that it is
the whole spatio-temporal ‘worms’ that we intuitively consider objects. For instance, on the three-
dimensionalist view Rafal Urbaniak at this instant and Rafal Urbaniak from ﬁve minutes ago are not
literally exactly the same object (although, there is a certain relation between them that resembles
identity). On the four-dimensionalist view, Rafal Urbaniak at this instant is only part of the whole
Rafal Urbaniak which is the whole consisting of Rafal Urbaniak at all moments at which he is alive.

4.7 Time Slices and Ontology
101
conscious of some problems related to identity, time-slices etc. The discussion occurs
in the context of Ontology, and the following sophism is discussed. Let us start with
the following premises:
Warsaw ε older than the Saski Garden.
(4.14)
Warsaw of 1830 ε smaller than Warsaw of 1930.
(4.15)
Warsaw of 1830 ε Warsaw.
(4.16)
Warsaw of 1930 ε Warsaw.
(4.17)
‘Older than the Saski Garden’, ‘smaller than Warsaw of 1930’ and ‘Warsaw’ are all
taken to be names, in Le´sniewski’s wide sense of the word. (The ﬁrst one names
all and only those things which are older than the Saski Garden, the second one all
and only those things which are smaller than Warsaw of 1930.) Now, note that the
following two are theorems of Ontology:
∀a, b, c (a ε b ∧c ε a →c ε b)
(4.18)
∀a, b, c, d (a ε b ∧c ε a ∧d ε a →c ε d)
(4.19)
(4.19) entails:
Warsaw ε older than the Saski Garden ∧Warsaw of 1930 ε Warsaw ∧
∧Warsaw of 1830 ε Warsaw →Warsaw of 1930 ε Warsaw of 1830
(4.20)
But the antecedent is provided by (4.14), (4.16), and (4.17), so we get:
Warsaw of 1930 is Warsaw of 1830.
(4.21)
now, by applying (4.18) to (4.15) and (4.17) we conclude:
Warsaw of 1930 is smaller than Warsaw of 1930.
(4.22)
Since the conclusion is quite obviously false while the premises seem true, we
need to ﬁnd the fallacy. For Le´sniewski, it is an equivocation of the word ‘Warsaw’
in the premises. To make (4.14) true, ‘Warsaw’ has to be taken as a singular term
which names one object (presumably, Warsaw from the beginning to the end of its
existence). But then, to time-slice of Warsaw (Warsaw of 1830, Warsaw of 1930)
can be truly called Warsaw, and so (4.16) and (4.17) are false in this reading.

102
4
Le´sniewski’s Ontology
On the other hand, to make either (4.16) or (4.17) true, ‘Warsaw’ has to be taken
as a general name referring to (at least two, if not all) time-slices of Warsaw. But if
this is the case, ‘Warsaw’ cannot be a subject of a true atomic sentence and (4.14) is
false.22
4.8 Le´sniewski’s Arithmetic
Using the language of Ontology, Le´sniewski developed his own axiomatization of
arithmetic (Srzednicki and Stachniak 1988, pp. 129–152). More or less, it is a version
of Peano Arithmetic. The axioms are:
1 ε nat
∀a [a ε nat →sq(a) ε nat]
∀a [a ε nat →¬sq(a) = 1]
∀a, b [a ε nat ∧b ε nat ∧sq(a) = sq(b) →a = b]
∀a, b [1 ε b ∧∀c (c ε nat ∧c ε b →sq(c) ε b) ∧a ε nat →a ε b]
∀a [a ε nat →a + 1 = sq(a)]
∀a, b [a ε nat ∧b ε nat →a × (b + 1) = (a + b) + 1]
∀a (a ε nat →a × 1 = a)
∀a, b [a ε nat ∧b ε nat →a × (b + 1) = (a × b) + a]
∀a, b [a ε nat ∧b ε nat ∧a > b →∃c (c ε nat ∧a = b + c)]
∀a, b [a ε nat ∧b ε nat →a + b > a]
∀a, b (a ε sq(b) →b ε nat)
All but three last axioms are fairly standard axioms of (second order) Peano
arithmetic, including the second order induction axiom. The third and second last
axioms are added to handle ordering. Only the last axiom is somewhat unusual,
because the lecture notes suggest that “it is not a thesis of Peano arithmetic” and
that it is essential for proving ∀a, b (a ε sq(b) →a ε nat).23 The lecture notes claim
22 Something that Le´sniewski didn’t say (but which corresponds to the four-dimensionalist view) is
that there is a reading which makes all premises true but which makes the application of (4.18) and
(4.19) illegitimate, because the logical form of (4.16) and (4.17) is not the same as that of a ε b. In
this reading ‘Warsaw’ refers to a unique, four-dimensional object (Warsaw from the beginning to the
end of its existence), ‘Warsaw of 1830’ refers to a yearly time-slice of Warsaw and ‘Warsaw of 1930’
refers to another yearly time-slice of Warsaw. (4.16) instead of saying that among object(s) named
by ‘Warsaw’ there is the object which is named by ‘Warsaw of 1830’ says rather that Warsaw of
1830 is part of Warsaw (and similarly for (4.17)). But in this reading it does not follow that Warsaw
of 1930 is Warsaw of 1830, even if ‘Warsaw’ names exactly one object and (4.14) is true.
23 “The axiom . . . restricts the scope of the term ‘sq’. Without this restriction the axiom system of
Peano arithmetic is not sufﬁcient.” (Srzednicki and Stachniak 1988, p. 141)

4.8 Le´sniewski’s Arithmetic

independence, but do not provide any independence proof. Le´sniewski then proceeds
to meticulously derive quite a few moderately exciting consequences, such as the
commutativity, associativity and distributivity of arithmetical operations.24
4.9 Further Readings
The ﬁrst thing the reader may want to take a look at is the only existing collection
of papers related directly to Le´sniewski’s Ontology and Mereology (Srzednicki and
Rickey 1984). It contains English translations of Kruszewski (1925) and Soboci´nski
(1949, 1954). Lejewski (1954, 1958, 1969), Słupecki (1955), Canty (1969), Iwanu´s
(1973), and Clay (1966, 1970, 1974a) are also included.
The simplest subsystem of Ontology we get when we allow only name variables
and do not admit any quantiﬁcation. A general account and metatheory of calculi
of this kind can be found in Pietruszczak (1991). Pietruszczak constructs various
calculi of this kind and provides a general method for proving completeness of those
with respect to set-theoretic semantics. Since the book was published only in Polish
his work is relatively unknown. Quite independently, a subsystem of Ontology of
this sort (quantiﬁer–free, name variables only), called L1 was studied by Ishimoto
(1977); Ishimoto and Kobayashi (1982); Ishimoto (1997).
More general systems are generated by introducing quantiﬁers binding name
variables only. Some authors call the subsystem of Ontology which contains only
this sort of quantiﬁers ‘elementary Ontology’. Some other authors use ‘elementary
Ontology’ to refer to a rather stronger system which admits also second-order vari-
ables and quantiﬁers binding them (that is, we also allow variables representing
functors that take name arguments only), but no variables (or constants) of other
categories.Elementary Ontology in the latter sense is discussed especially by Iwanu´s
(1973)—who also shows it to be equivalent to the theory of atomic Boolean alge-
bras and the classical theory of set algebras. Iwanu´s also provides an interesting
decidability proof for Elementary Ontology.
Elementary Ontology is also discussed in the ﬁrst part of one of the best surveys on
Ontology (Słupecki 1955). Słupecki, however, discusses also some aspects of non-
elementary Ontology, which is obtained mainly by adding the rule of extensionality.
He proves that deﬁnitions in the system satisfy the condition of translatability, i.e.,
for every φ which contains a deﬁned term there is a provably equivalent expression φ′
which does not contain this term. Interestingly, deﬁnitions are creative in the system.
They can be made non-creative by introducing two axiom schemata. Słupecki also
sketches the proof of the theorem that Ontology is consistent relative to Protothetic.
A speciﬁc type of functional completeness of Elementary Ontology with respect
to ε has been proven by Urbaniak (2006a).
24 Le´sniewski also attempted to eliminate recursive deﬁnition by means of explicit deﬁnitions in
the language of Ontology. Alas, the notes on this topic are rather scant and the issue requires further
investigation beyond the scope of this book.

Le´sniewski’s Ontology
Lejewski (1958) is intended as a survey of the full–blown Ontology. It contains
more elaborate intuitive explanations of the intended meaning of epsilon and some
other connectives deﬁnable in Ontology. Lejewski, who is interested in replacing
epsilon with another, more intuitive for native English speakers, connective proves
that Ontology can be constructed with inclusion as the sole primitive term (Lejewski,
1977).25
Various equivalent axiomatizations of Ontology are discussed in Soboci´nski
(1934). Miéville (2004) is a recent French text intended as a historical introduc-
tion to Ontology.
Canty (1969) explains the relation between the epsilon, the distributive predica-
tion, and higher-order epsilon connectives. The discussion is quite informal.
Urbaniak (2006b) proves that in set-theoretic semantics the classical Ontology has
at least ℵ0 non-standard models with a non-standard ε . Urbaniak (2009) strengthens
the result by proving that no set of second-order formulas of the language of Ontology
can unambiguously ﬁx the set-theoretic interpretation of ε .
Kubi´nski (1969) gives a convincing sketch of a proof that Ontology is absolutely
non-categorical (i.e. that no set of formulas of Ontology deﬁnes a class of models up
to isomorphism).
Le´sniewski’s systems raise also certain philosophical concerns. One of the crucial
questions (which I discuss in Chap. 8) is the meaning of quantiﬁers and variables.
Le´sniewski claimed that his systems are nominalistic but he used something that
nowadays can be easily construed as higher-order quantiﬁcation. How to interpret
the role of variables and quantiﬁers in Le´sniewski’s systems to avoid this clash?
Another interesting aspect is how Ontology can be applied in philosophy. Does
formalizing arguments using Ontology provide us with a new insight into their quality
or meaning?
Munitz (1974) is an interesting book that covers some differences in expressing
existence in various logical systems, Ontology included. Existential assumptions and
commitments as expressed in Ontology were, it seems, ﬁrst discussed in Lejewski
(1954). An interesting commentary to Lejewski is Kearns (1969).
Prior (1965) argues that variables in Ontology represent class names rather than
singularoremptyorcommonterms.However,hedoesnotexplainwhatthedifference
is and why it is so important. He does not explain what he means by a class name.26
Sagal (1973) criticizes Prior.27
Since the quantiﬁers in Le´sniewski’s systems do not (or at least, were not intended
to) express ontological commitment, a perfectly legitimate question arises as to what
those quantiﬁers were supposed to do and how we are to interpret variables that occur
in the system. For instance, there is some similarity between Le´sniewski’s account
25 This inclusion functor in the classical formulation of Ontology is deﬁned by (4.6) on p. 87.
26 Also, the main argument that he presents is not very compelling. It seems to be this: regular
names cannot be logically complex (he does not explain this notion either), class names can, names
in Ontology can be complex, therefore names in Ontology are class names.
27 He does so mostly on the grounds that this reading disagrees with Le´sniewski’s dislike of abstract
objects.

and the theory of plural quantiﬁcation developed by Boolos (1998a) (informally
discussed by Simons (1997)).28
The question of ontological commitment of Ontology is also raised by Simons
(1995). Simons suggests a different criterion of ontological commitment (which
is,unfortunately quite vague):
I shall say that a set of propositions …ontologically commits to those objects (of whatever
ontological category) that, in some sense of ‘exist’ have to exist if all the propositions in the
set are true.
and argues that Ontology has no ontological commitments. His claim that Ontology
is valid if the domain of individuals is empty is certainly true (he gives a proof).
However, this does not seem to answer exactly the question whether it is free of any
commitments. In his proof, the truth-conditions of higher-order statements tacitly
do much of the heavy lifting, and the question whether their use does not involve
any commitment has not been successfully answered. Simons attempts to provide
some hints in Simons (1985b), where he suggests his ‘combinatorial semantics’ in
which name variables (are supposed to) range over ‘ways of meaning’, but it is not a
precise account and this approach has not yet been fully developed and assessed. He
does pose an interesting problem: how should one construct a formal semantics for
Le´sniewski’s logic which performs the task a formal semantics normally performs,
but does not assume explicitly or implicitly the existence of abstract objects?
Küng and Canty (1970) argue that the quantiﬁcation in Ontology is not objectual
(referential).29 The authors claim that the interpretation should be substitutional
(although they suggest that they can be interpreted as referential over a realm of
sets associated with a domain of objects). Kielkopf (1977) criticizes the view in its
whole generality, but he introduces some other subtle interpretations of quantiﬁers
which are neither straightforward substitutional nor referential. Küng (1977) applies
28 There are of course some differences. For Le´sniewski, quantiﬁcation does not express existence
(i.e. ∃a φ, philosophically is not to be meant as stating that there exists a such that φ). For Boolos
individual quantiﬁcation commits one to individuals and the higher-order quantiﬁcation in the
standard interpretation commits one to certain kinds of abstract entities, but monadic higher-order
quantiﬁcation interpreted as relating to plurals commits us to only whatever individuals we need
to render the relevant sentence true. Also, Le´sniewski assumes that the category of names contains
singular names, empty names and plurals indiscernibly. Boolos treats plurals as another group in
its own right. He has a syntactic distinction between two kinds of nominal variables. I discuss the
relation in more detail in Chap. 8.
29 The quantiﬁcation in a given language is called referential (or objectual) with respect to a given
semantics of this language if the truth in a model of quantiﬁed statements is dependent upon there
being (or not) some objects in the domain of this model satisfying (or not) the formula resulting
from the initial formula by deleting the quantiﬁer. Or, in other words, in the objectual interpretation
variables in a model are assigned objects in the domain of this model. The objectual reading is
often opposed to the substitutional reading, where variables are rather associated with a substitution
class—the class of expressions (which do not belong to the domain of the model), and the satisfaction
of a formula in a model is deﬁned via some results of substitution being true (or not). Clearly,
Ontology as an axiomatic system can be given both an objectual and a substitutional interpretation.
Presumably, the question of whether quantiﬁcation in Ontology is objectual or substitutional boils
down to something like: ‘which interpretation is in accordance with Le´sniewski’s views?’.

106

Le´sniewski’s Ontology
so-called prologue-functors (developed by Küng (1974)) like ‘whatever extension
the inscriptions equiform with the following item are taken to have …the following
is asserted …’ to account for quantiﬁcation in Le´sniewski’s systems (whether this
reading is nominalistic depends on how the notion of extension is understood,and
providing a nominalistic explanation of what an extension is is not an easy matter).
A very interesting approach to semantics of Ontology has been taken by Rickey
(1985). Quantiﬁed name calculi are interpreted in ﬁrst-order two-sorted models. One
sort is the sort of individuals, another sort is the sort of names. A binary relation on
the Cartesian product of those two sorts is added, which intuitively corresponds to
the relation of naming.
Soboci´nski (1949) deals with Le´sniewski’s solution to Russell’s paradox
(Soboci´nski 1949 was published in a few parts, but is reprinted in whole in
Srzednicki and Rickey 1984). There are some reasons to think that this solution
is not satisfactory, as I argue in detail in Chap. 7 (see also Urbaniak 2008).
Lejewski (1985) is an interesting attempt to use the expressivity of the language
of Ontology to capture main intuitions pertaining to sets. I discuss this attempt and
indicate its weaknesses in section also in Chap. 7.
Deﬁnite descriptions as formulated in Le´sniewski’s Ontology have also been stud-
ied. Hi˙z (1977) proved that the deﬁnition of descriptions in ⋆14.01 of Principia
Mathematica when formulated in the language of Ontology, is in Ontology provably
equivalent to the axiom of Ontology. I described this result in Sect.4.6. Another
discussion of Russell’s theory of descriptions from a Le´sniewskian point of view is
Lejewski (1960), to which Russell responded in Russell (1960).
Lambert and Scharle (1967) argue that the system of free logic FLt is trans-
latably equivalent to a ﬁrst-order modiﬁcation of elementary Ontology called L4′.
The authors suggest that their translation “Provides for the ﬁrst time …a way of
interpreting at least the ﬁrst order fragment of one version of Le´sniewski’s system
called Ontology in more general parlance”. Simons (1981) correctly criticizes this
claim, where he points out that L4′ (1) is not a subsystem of Ontology, because it
has an additional axiom requiring that no term be general, and (2) even if it were a
subsystem, it would be a narrow part of Ontology, and so it is false that free logics
provide a more general parlance to speak of Ontology. Interesting modiﬁcations of
Ontology that allow to embed some free logics are developed by Simons (1985a).
Grzegorczyk (1955) compares Ontology to Boolean algebra and suggests that
Ontology formally resembles the theory of complete atomic Boolean algebras with
constants and functions of an arbitrary high type. Iwanu´s (1973), p. 202 elaborates
on this issue, emphasizing some differences: Boolean algebras are not provided with
a rule of deﬁnitions, so the statement should be conditional: if we extend the the-
ory of Boolean algebras with a good account of deﬁnitions (which is pretty much
a translation of Le´sniewski’s rules), then there is a correspondence. Also, the proof
of the equivalence between elementary Ontology (in the stronger sense) and theory
of Boolean algebras states something about a proper subsystem of Ontology only.
Interestingly, it was Le´sniewski’s research that inspired Tarski’s work on the founda-
tions of Boolean algebras (1935), which played an essential role in the development
of Boolean algebras.

4.9 Further Readings
107
Stachniak (1981) develops a strengthening of Ontology, L DF and a semantics
for this calculus, where models are taken to be atomic Booleanalgebras enriched
by a speciﬁc set of functions and relations. The strengthening consists in including
an axiom schema which, brieﬂy speaking, resembles the axiom of comprehension.
Stachniak uses a fairly standard method of constructing models from constants to
prove the completeness and compactness theorems. He also discusses the ultraprod-
uct construction of models for Ontology. Deﬁnitions in L DF are not creative.
Lebiedewa (1969a; 1969b) extends Ontology by introducing modalities.
There is also an interesting modiﬁcation of Ontology which is meant to deal with
vague terms (Kubi´nski, 1958). Kubi´nski (1959) developed also a modiﬁcation of
Ontology that is intended to deal with apparent contradictions of the form ‘a is b and
a is not b’.Unfortunately, both papers are available in Polish only. Kubi´nski (1960)
extends Ontology with means to express something like ‘a is more like b than like c’.
An ontological version of the axiom of choice is independent of Ontology.
Kowalski (1977) studies the extension of Ontology obtained by adding this axiom,
and Davis (1975) discusses various formulations of this axioms. Perhaps the most
elegant of these formulations is: ‘∃f ∀a, g (g(a) →g( f (a)))’.
An interesting extension of Ontology is constructed when we add an axiom of
inﬁnity. When this is done, a theory that bi-interprets Peano arithmetic is derivable
(i.e. is a proper sub-theory of the theory thus obtained). Gödel’s theorem applies to
this extension (Canty 1967). In a sense, those strengthenings can constitute founda-
tional systems that Le´sniewski was after. There are some problems, however,which
mostly have to do with Le´sniewski’s philosophical views. Le´sniewski claimed to be
a nominalist. Unless a plausible nominalist story about quantiﬁcation in Ontology
is told, it is fairly unclear that Ontology itself is a nominalistically acceptable tool.
Le´sniewski also opposed the idea of modifying a system “just to make it work”
(that was his main objection against developing weaker set theories just to avoid
the Russell’s paradox) and he believed that the axioms of his systems correspond to
certain essential features of reality (he even called them true). That being the case,
a question arises as to whether postulating the actual existence of inﬁnitely many

Le´sniewski’s Mereology
Abstract First,IfocusonLe´sniewski’sphilosophicalmotivationsforMereology:he
constructed the system to provide a nominalistically acceptable alternative to set
theory as a foundational system. Next, I compare axiomatizations from years 1916,
1918, 1920 and 1921. Then, I introduce a selection of mereological theorems. Some
seem to support the claim that Mereology can be a sensible replacement for set theory
and some indicate the extent Mereology to which it is different from the standard
set theory. I also critically assess the potential role of Mereology in the foundations
of mathematics. My assessment is rather negative. (It will be clear in chaps.7 and 8
that it is Ontology and not Mereology that should play the foundational role.) The
last section contains a survey of secondary literature related to Mereology.
5.1 Why Mereology?
Mereology1 was the ﬁrst deductive system developed (around 1916) by Le´sniewski.2
It arose from his considerations regarding Russell’s antinomy.3 He wanted to provide
an alternative system of foundations of mathematics which avoids antinomies, but
1 The name originates from the ancient Greek and loosely speaking means ‘a science about parts’.
2 So, historically speaking, it was the ﬁrst theory he constructed, however imperfect formally it
was at that time. In his endeavor to provide it with a secure logical background theory he later
developed Ontology and Protothetic. Goodman in The structure of appearance (Goodman 1966)
credits Le´sniewski with the publication of “a [emph. mine] calculus of individuals”. The one
Goodman presents in the book is a variant formulated by Leonard in The calculus of individuals
and its uses (Goodman and Leonard 1940). The mereological axioms are equivalent to Le´sniewski’s,
but the underlying logic in Goodman and Leonard (1940) is weaker.
3 “I occupied myself zealously with the ‘antinomies’. From the time when in the year 1911 I began
an acquaintance with them by meeting with the ‘antinomies’ of Russell related to the ‘class of classes
not elements of themselves’, and problems concerning the antinomies were the most demanding
subject of my deliberations for over eleven years.” (Le´sniewski 1927, 199)

Le´sniewski’s Mereology
unlikestandardsettheorydoesnotpaytheprizeofgivinguponintuitivelycompelling
assumptions. In the preface to the ﬁrst presentation of his Mereology he writes:
The present work is the ﬁrst link in an extended series of works, which I intend to publish
in the near or distant future, desiring to contribute as much as possible to the justiﬁcation
of modern mathematics …The arrangement of deﬁnitions and truths, which I established in
the present work dedicated to the most general problems of the theory of sets, has for me,
in comparison to other previously known arrangements of deﬁnitions and truths (Zermelo,
Russell, etc.) this advantage that it eliminates the ‘antinomies’ of the general theory of
sets without narrowing the original domain of Cantor’s term ‘set’ …and on the other hand,
it does not lead to assertions which are in such startling conﬂict with intuitions of the
‘commonalty’…(Le´sniewski 1916, 129–130)
The basic idea behind Mereology is that a collection of material objects is nothing
more than a concrete whole consisting of those objects taken together. This means,
for example, that the mereological class of stones in a given heap is nothing more
than the heap itself. In the early stage of development of set-theory the informal
explanations of what a set is indeed might have suggested this reading. For example,
Cantor says:
Any set of distinct things can be regarded as a single thing in which those objects are
constituents or constitutive elements.4
For Cantor, examples of objects standing in the relation of constitution are: (a) par-
ticular sounds and the whole musical composition, (b) a picture and its suitably
matched parts. Considering the way the development of Cantor’s set-theory went it
seems that Cantor did not understand sets mereologically. The point is, however, that
in the early years of set theory, informal explanations were not precise enough to
exclude this interpretation.
As we have already seen (in Sect.2.8.4), Le´sniewski relied on mereological intu-
itions about classes already when he dealt with Russell’s paradox in (1914a). At that
time, however, he did not use any axiomatization of his theory of parthood. Only
in 1916 he took the ﬁrst stab at constructing such a system. It was not technically
perfect. There were axioms, deﬁnitions, theorems and proofs, but he did not go far
with formalization. He did use something like name variables, but everything else
was stated using natural language. Also, the logic underlying his proofs was not
explicitly formulated. Strictly speaking, while publishing on Mereology, Le´sniewski
never went much further in the level of formalization.5 Only in later papers did he ﬁll
4 “Jede Menge wohlunterschiedener Dinge kann als ein einheithliches Ding für sich angesehen
werden, in welchem jene Dinge Bestandteile oder constitutive Elemente sind.” (my translation of
Cantor 1877, 83)
5 In his last paper on Mereology he does suggest abbreviating some name-forming functors, but
the proofs and theorems are still stated quite informally (Le´sniewski 1931a). Still, it deserves the
name of a formalization because he introduces axioms and deﬁnitions, which despite containing
certain natural language expressions, like ‘is a part of’ or ‘is’ are formulated in quite a regimented
language. He also proves that certain other expressions which he calls theorems follow from these
axioms and deﬁnitions. Even though he had not formulated clearly his rules of inference by that
time, his proofs were quite regimented and detailed. In a way, they look very much like an applied

in the gap by introducing two logical systems (Protothetic and Ontology) in which
his prior informal arguments can be formalized.
Le´sniewski adhered to the view which identiﬁes classes with what we nowadays
would call ‘mereological fusions’ and he intended to build a few claims into his
system: he rejected the existence of the empty set, did not distinguish between an
object and its singleton, wanted to avoid reference to abstract objects and extensions,
and disagreed with Russell and Whitehead’s no class theory. Let’s take a look at a
closer look at these points.
First, he considered the existence of the empty set dubious. The empty set seemed
for him to be something invented or introduced just for convenience (mainly to make
the set product operation uniform and executable for any sets).6 Also, Le´sniewski
took antorian deﬁnition seriously. If any set is constituted by its elements, then
whenever there is nothing that constitutes it, the set itself does not exist.
Being of the opinion that, if an object is the class of some a …then it actually consists of a,
I always rejected …the existence of theoretical monstrosities like the class of square circles,
understanding only too well that nothing can consist of something which does not even exist.
(Le´sniewski 1927, 214)
Second, he did not recognize the distinction between an object and its singleton.
Here it is important to distinguish two readings of the claim that an object is iden-
tical with its singleton. In the ﬁrst reading, accepted by Le´sniewski, if a name m
names exactly one object x, then the expression ‘the class of m’ also names exactly
one object, namely x itself. However, Le´sniewski did not accept the view that for
any object x, x is a class k such that any object y which is an element of k is identical
(Footnote 5 continued)
system of natural deduction (e.g. to prove a conditional he assumes the antecedent and proves the
consequent; to prove a conditional within the scope of a universal quantiﬁer he freezes the relevant
variable(s), assumes the antecedent and proves the consequent).
6 For example, Fraenkel says: “On purely formal grounds, namely to be able to express certain facts
more easily and more conveniently, we introduce at this point a further improper set, the so-called
null-set. This is deﬁned as containing no element whatever; it is therefore in virtue of the deﬁnition
from page 4 not a set at all, but it will on the ground of a special appointment and by an extension
of that deﬁnition, will be counted as one (indeed as a ﬁnite one) and will be designated by 0.”
(my translation of Fraenkel 1928, 21) Also in a more modern text Fraenkel, Bar-Hillel and Levy
suggest that the reason for postulating the empty set is practical: “The practical reasons which call
for the existence of an individual are as follows. When we deﬁne the intersection of two sets r
and s to be the set t which consists of those elements which belong to both r and s, we want the
intersection to be deﬁned even in the case where r and s have no members in common. In this case
the intersection t has to be a memberless element, i.e. an individual. There are also many other
examples where the existence of a memberless element makes things simpler. The same practical
reasons which call for the existence of such an element also call for using always the same element
for the intersection of any two sets r and s with no members in common, and for referring to this
element as a set. Therefore we shall call this element the null-set and our sets are, from now on, the
elements which have members as well as the null set. Let us, however, stress at this point that whereas
the existence of at least one individual is required for serious philosophical reasons, referring to one
of the individuals as the null-set is done only for reasons of convenience and simplicity, and can be
regarded as a mere notational convention.”(Fraenkel et al. 1973, 24)

Le´sniewski’s Mereology
with the object x. In other words, he accepted the ﬁrst and rejected the second of
these claims:
mεm →Kl(m) = m
mεm →∀b (b is an element of Kl(m) →bεm)
The ﬁrst claim is in accordance with the mereological account of classes. The second
(insofar as we accept Le´sniewski’s identiﬁcation of being an element with being a
part7) goes against it. Let us name a speciﬁc chosen lizard ‘Aldo’. Now, the singleton
of Aldo is (for Le´sniewski) Aldo himself. It is not the case, however, than any element
of this singleton (that is, any part of Aldo) is Aldo.
This issue touches upon another interesting feature of mereological classes. They
have cardinality only relative to countable noun phrases. The question ‘how many
objects does the heap of stones consist of?’ is as difﬁcult to answer as the question
‘how many parts does this heap have?’. On the other hand, the question like ‘how
many stones does it consist of?’ seems easier to answer.
Every mereological class can also be viewed as singleton, relative to the name of
itself. So for example, the class of humans is the mereological whole composed of
all people. But the class of the class of humans is a singleton, in the sense that it is
the class of certain a (namely, ‘the class of humans’), where a is a singular term.
This also indicates that using the term ‘singleton’ in this loose, relative sense is not
too useful.8
Third, Le´sniewski neither believed in the existence of abstract objects nor did
he think he understood in the slightest explanations that employed ‘extensions of
concepts’, ‘concepts’ or ‘courses of values of functions’:
I will not attempt here to submit Frege’s conception which treats classes as ‘extensions of
concepts’ to analytic assessment because, despite my best efforts in this direction, I am
still unable to understand what the various authors are saying when they use the expression
‘extension of a concept’. If the ‘extension of concept a’ is not to be the class of objects a
consisting of objects a in accordance with my conception of classes, then, being unable to
answermyownquestionastowhatthis‘extensionofconcepta’couldbeandwhenandwhere
one could become acquainted with such an ‘extension’ and whether anything like it exists in
the world, I am none the less inclined to surmise meekly that it is simply an object ‘devised’
by logicians for the annoyance of many generations. I am no more able to understand Frege’s
utterance …that the ‘extension of a concept’ “attaches to the concept itself and to it alone”,
than I am the most obscure enunciation of the exponents of ‘romantic philosophy’, which
simply means that I do not understand the utterance at all. The declaration, according to
which “With such functions whose value is always a truth-value, we can say ‘extension of
the concept’ instead of ‘course of values of the function’ and it seems appropriate to call
directly a concept, a function whose value is always a truth-value” does nothing to clarify
for me the question of the ‘extensions of concepts’ because the expression ‘course of values
7 More technically, with being an ingredient. I will discuss the details of this identiﬁcation later.
8 One could try to deﬁne the notion differently and say that a singleton is a class which has a unique
element. But in this sense, the fact that a class is the class of a’s, where a is a singular term is not
sufﬁcient for this class to be a singleton (although it is a necessary condition). What is sufﬁcient is
that the object which generates the class has no parts, that is, is an atom.

5.1 Why Mereology?

of the function’ is no more intelligible to me than the expression ‘extension of the concept’.
(Le´sniewski 1927, 219–220)
Also, Le´sniewski objected to the philosophical underpinnings of Whitehead’s and
Russell’s no-class theory. Basically, the no-class theory in Principia Mathematica
takes the symbols for classes to be incomplete symbols, just like deﬁnite descriptions,
and provides a way of reducing expressions containing them to expressions which
do not contain symbols for classes. A philosophical motivation for this approach to
be found in Principia Mathematica is:
The symbols for classes, like those for descriptions, are, in our system, incomplete symbols:
their uses are deﬁned, but they themselves are not assumed to mean anything at all. That
is to say, the uses of such symbols are so deﬁned that, when the deﬁniens is substituted
for the deﬁniendum, there no longer remains any symbols which could be supposed to
represent a class. Thus classes, so far as we introduce them, are merely symbolic or linguistic
conveniences, not genuine objects as their members are if they are individuals.
It is an old dispute whether formal logic should concern itself mainly with intensions or with
extensions. In general, logicians whose training was mainly philosophical have decided for
intensions, while those whose training was mainly mathematical have decided for extensions.
The facts seem to be that, while mathematical logic requires extensions, philosophical logic
refuses to supply anything except intensions. Our theory of classes recognizes and reconciles
these two apparently opposite facts, by showing that an extension (which is the same as a
class) is an incomplete symbol, whose use always acquires its meaning through a reference
to intension.
In the case of descriptions, it was possible to prove that they are incomplete symbols. In the
case of classes, we do not know of any equally deﬁnite proof, though arguments of more or
less cogency can be elicited from the ancient problem of the One and the Many⋆. It is not
necessary for our purposes, however, to assert dogmatically, that there are no such things as
classes. It is only necessary for us to show that the incomplete symbols which we introduce
as representatives of classes yield all the propositions for the sake of which classes might be
thought essential. (Whitehead and Russell 1913, I, 75–76)
Roughly, the no-class theory proceeds as follows. If φx is a matrix (that is, an
open formula), we say that φ ˆx is the name of the function involved in this matrix
itself. Functions that involve no variables except individuals are called ﬁrst-order
functions.Functionswhichhaveﬁrst-orderfunctionsamongtheirargumentsandhave
no arguments except ﬁrst-order functions and individuals are called second-order. In
general, a function is n+1-th order (n > 0) if it has at least one function of n-th order
among its arguments and no function of at least n +1-function among its arguments.
A function of order n is called predicative if in its deﬁnition only quantiﬁcation over
functions of order k < n is employed. The fact that φ ˆx is predicative is denoted
by putting an exclamation mark after φ: φ!ˆx and writing correspondingly φ!x for
its value. Two propositional functions are said to be formally equivalent when any
argument which satisﬁes one of them also satisﬁes the other. A function of a function
is called extensional when its truth-value with any argument is the same as with
any formally equivalent argument. All functions introduced in the system of PM are
extensional.
The authors also accept the Axiom of Reducibility which states that given any
function φˆx there is a formally equivalent predicative function. For functions of

116

Le´sniewski’s Mereology
one and two variables it is formulated (Whitehead and Russell 1913, I, 71–72) as
(I changed the notation slightly):
∀φ ∃ψ ∀x (φx ≡ψ!x)
∀φ ∃ψ ∀x, y (φ(x, y) ≡ψ!(x, y))
Now, every propositional function φ ˆx determines a class ˆz(φz). If two functions are
formally equivalent, they determine the same class:
∀φ, ψ [ˆz(φz) = ˆz(ψz) ≡∀x (φx ≡ψx)]
How do Russell and Whitehead reduce the notion of class which satisﬁes the
above conditions, but also which allows a name of a class to stand as a grammatical
subject of a sentence to a sentence which does not contain any name of a class? The
three relevant deﬁnitions are:
⋆20.01
f {ˆz(ψz)} =Df ∃φ [∀x (φ!x ≡ψx) ∧f {φ!ˆz}]
⋆20.02
x ∈(φ!ˆz) =Df φ!x
⋆20.03
cls =Df ˆα{∃φ (α = ˆz(φ!z))}
The idea is this. If we have a sentence which apparently states something about
a class, we reduce it using 20.01 to a statement about a predicative function (the
existence of which is guaranteed by the Axiom of Reducibility). Speciﬁcally, saying
that a certain predicative function determines a class and an object is an element
of this class, by 20.02 boils down to saying that this function applied to this object
yields a true proposition. 20.03 allows us to use the name ‘class’ itself.
The star in the Le´sniewski quotation is a reference to an argument against the
existence of classes put forward by Russell. The argument is:
If there is such an object as a class, it must be in some sense one object. Yet it is only of
classes that many can be predicated. Hence, if we admit classes as objects, we must suppose
that the same object can be both one and many, which seems impossible. (Whitehead and
Russell 1913, I, 72)
Le´sniewski was quite amazed that the argument had been taken seriously (1927, 224–
226). It seemed to him that using the word ‘many’ makes sense when it is treated as a
quantiﬁcational device in the contexts like ‘there are many a’s’ where a is a general
countable term. But then, there is no single object which has the property of being
many. On the other hand, for no object x does it make sense to say that x is many,
because ‘many’ does not express a property that an object can posses:
Despite my sincerest wish, I am unable to treat seriously the thesis which proclaims that, “if
we admit classes as objects, we must suppose that the same object can be both one and many
which seems impossible”, as I feel in it some gross misunderstanding: even posito that the
expression ‘many’ causes no doubts on the theme ‘at least how many?’, I can ﬁnd no sense
in saying about some object that it is ‘many’ even though, by assuming that the meaning
of the expression ‘many’ is not uncertain with respect to quantity, that it means e.g., the

same as ‘at least two’, I fully understand e.g., the utterance that ‘many objects’ exist in the
world …Seeing no sense in the thesis quoted, I cannot regard it as an even slightly ‘cogent’
argument for anything at all in the world. (Le´sniewski 1927, 225–226)
Le´sniewski disagreed also with the no–class theory itself. He believed that the
name ‘class’ has some irreducible use in the natural language. However, he thought it
was the mereological use: collections of concrete objects are concrete objects, every
class is an element of itself and being an element is the same as being a part (in the
improper sense that treats every object as a part of itself). His formalized Mereology
was meant to be a theory of classes thus understood.9
5.2 Axiomatizations
I will now describe four axiomatizations of Mereology developed by Le´sniewski.
They come from (respectively) 1916, 1918, 1920, 1921.10 The ﬁrst axiomatization
was ﬁrst published in 1928. The axiomatization from 1918 (published in Le´sniewski
1930a resulted from Le´sniewski’s discontent with the fact that the axiomatization
from 1916 employed deﬁned terms in two of its axioms. The 1920 axiomatization
(published in Le´sniewski 1930a as well) took ‘being an ingredient’ (i.e. a proper or
an improper part) as the primitive, instead of ‘being a proper part’ used in previous
axiomatization. His axiomatization from 1921 (published in Le´sniewski 1931a) is
signiﬁcantly simpler. It takes ‘being exterior’ as the primitive and consists of two (as
opposed to four) axioms.
A generally interesting question is why Le´sniewski waited that long with publica-
tion of his results. This question is hard to answer. Most likely, he was a perfectionist
and did not want to publish his results before preparing versions which he would
consider ﬁnal. There is only one passage where Le´sniewski comments on this issue,
and he rather tries to ﬁnd an excuse for publishing his papers which he does not
consider really ready for publication rather than explain why he waited so long. In
the beginning of his On the Foundations of Mathematics he says:
The aim of this work is the removal of a painful situation, in which I have found myself for
a number of years. The situation consists in this, that I possess a good many unpublished
scientiﬁc results from various areas of the foundations of mathematics, that the number
of these unpublished results continually grows, and since these results inter–relate with
9 Le´sniewski also admitted a second use, called ‘distributive’, which was similar to that formalized
by the classical set theory. Even though no published work by Le´sniewski contains this claim (he
does not even say explicitly that one can make sense of Cantor’s set theory or of the system of
Principia when one considers this to be the sense they were concerned with), it has been made
by competent Le´sniewskian scholars (Luschei 1962, 29–32; Soboci´nski 1949b). I will discuss this
issue in Chap.7.
10 The systems are dated based on Le´sniewski’s testimony present in the papers in which he describes
his systems, which was conﬁrmed by people like Kotarbi´nski with whom Le´sniewski had discussed
his results long before he published them (see for instance Kotarbi´nski 1929). Also, Le´sniewski had
lectured on his systems while in Warsaw long before they were actually published.

Le´sniewski’s Mereology
each other and with the results of other researchers in these areas, the technical–editorial
difﬁculties connected with their preparation for publication continually increase.
While I was trying different ways of arranging the scientiﬁc results to which I had arrived,
I considered among others a systematic–compendium method, I took as a model in this
connection the well–known work of Whitehead and Russell. However, such a task is again
spreading over a number of years, and it is difﬁcult for me to determine how much time I
would still need, in order to submit in this way for a wider technical discussion the whole
of the results, to which I have been led by already more than ten years of reﬂection on the
foundation of mathematics.
Thispainful situationisfurthercomplicatedbythe fact that just asIreachedsome ofmyviews
and some scientiﬁc results under the inﬂuence of conversations with my colleagues and in
connection with their still unpublished scientiﬁc results, so also my views and observations,
which I had formulated during a number of years in university lectures and in numerous
scientiﬁc discussions, have contributed to the formation of certain opinions and results of my
colleagues, who, out of an admirable loyalty towards me, have withheld from publication
until now a number of their scientiﬁc results, until my own related results are published.
(Le´sniewski 1927, 174–175).
Putting these historical issues aside, let us take a look at the axiomatizations them-
selves.
5.2.1 Axiomatization from 1916
The language in which Mereology was originally formulated was partially informal.
However, for the purpose of presentation I will use Ontology as the logical theory
which underlies Mereology and I will formalize theorems of Mereology using the
language of Ontology. Rules of inference of Mereology are the same as that of
Ontology.11 In the process of formalization it is important to note that ‘a is not b’
and ‘every a is b’ for Le´sniewski had existential import. They were respectively
equivalent to: ‘a is an object and not(a is b)’ and ‘some object is a, and for any X,
if X is a, then X is b’. (Le´sniewski 1928, 230) Let us start with two preliminary
deﬁnitions (already given by Le´sniewski):
∀a, b [aε ∼b ≡aεa ∧¬aεb]
∀a, b [a ⊆b ≡∀c (cεa →cεb)]
The 1916 formulation had two axioms not containing deﬁned terms and two
axioms which involved previously deﬁned terms.12 The ﬁrst two axioms introduce
the notion of a part.
Axiom I
∀a, b (aεprt(b) →bε ∼prt(a))
that is, if a is a part of b, then b is an object which is not a part of the object a.
11 To avoid indexing variables in the chapter on Mereology I allow all the letters a, b, c, d, e, f, g
to be name variables.
12 Names of formulas in this paragraph come from the 1916 paper.

5.2 Axiomatizations
119
Axiom II
∀a, b, c (aεprt(b) ∧bεprt(c) →aεprt(c))
This states the transitivity of parthood relation: if a is a part of b and b is a part of c,
then a is a part of c.13
Axiom I indicates that strictly speaking by ‘part’ Le´sniewski understood a proper
part: a part of an object cannot be identical with that very object. For the reﬂexive clo-
sure of the parthood relation (sometimes called ‘improper parthood’) he introduced
the term ‘ingredient’,14 deﬁned by:
Deﬁnition I ∀a, b (aεingr(b) ≡(aεb ∧bεa) ∨aεprt(b))
which reads: a is an ingredient of b if and only if either a and b are the same object,
or a is a part of b. Two other important deﬁnitions are that of a set and that of a class.
As it will turn out, this has nothing to do with the standard set-theoretic distinction
between sets and classes. An object a is a set of b (or a set of bs) if and only if it is an
object such that every one of its ingredients has an ingredient which is an ingredient
of an object which is b:
Deﬁnition II ∀a, b (aεset(b) ≡aεa ∧∀c (cεingr(a) →
→∃d (dεingr(c) ∧∃e (eεb ∧dεingr(e) ∧eεingr(a)))))
For instance, the mereological whole constituted, say, by all people in Canada is
a set of people, because every one of its ingredients has an ingredient which is an
ingredient of a person (in Canada).
To see why this rather complicated iteration of “ingredienthood” is needed, con-
sider what would happen if the deﬁnition required only that every ingredient of a
be an ingredient of an object which is b. Then, the mereological whole constituted
by all people in Canada (call it CAN) would not be a set of people, because CAN
would have ingredients, like the mereological fusion of one person’s leg and another
person’s right hand, which would not be ingredients of any particular person.
Also, note that the indeﬁnite article in ‘is a set’ is there not without a purpose.
According to this deﬁnition, one countable noun may generate quite a few different
sets. The intuition here is that every mereological whole constituted by some objects
b (i.e. by some objects denoted by the countable noun phrase ‘b’) is a set of b,
although choosing different representatives (or groups of representatives) of b we
get different mereological wholes.
13 A quick reminder about the notation. I abbreviated Le´sniewski’s wording of formulas. Instead
of ‘for some’ I write ‘∃’, instead of ‘for all’ I write ‘∀’. Instead of ‘is’ I write ‘ε’. I also sometimes
changed the shape of brackets. Also, informally, Le´sniewski used capital variables in case when the
truth of a formula required that a term be singular. Otherwise, the formulas are pretty much the same
formulas that Le´sniewski gave. So, for instance, originally, Axiom II would read: ‘If P is a part of
object Q, and Q is a part of object R, then P is a part of object R.’ It is important to remember
that he did not have two sorts of variables in his ofﬁcial language, and only used capital letters
as variables in formulas for whose satisfaction it was required that those variables be interpreted
as individual terms. To avoid shaping syntax by semantics and to keep things simple I decided to
use only lower case variables. If the reader is not satisﬁed with my choice, he is free to rewrite all
relevant formulas in his favorite notation.
14 The term is claimed to have been suggested by Mr Lucjan Zarzecki (1928, 230).

Le´sniewski’s Mereology
Take another example: any heap of stones is a set of stones in the sense introduced
by Deﬁnition II. Therefore, if a names more than one object, the name set(a) names
also more than one object: it names any mereological whole constructed from some
objects that fall under a.
Another notion deﬁned by Le´sniewski is the one that determines the ‘maximal’
set of objects a, that is the set of all a’s. This is the notion of a class, and an object
a is a class of objects b if and only if every object b is an ingredient of a, and any
ingredient of a has an ingredient which is also an ingredient of some object b:15
Deﬁnition III ∀a, b (aεcl(b) ≡aεa ∧∀c (cεb →cεingr(a))∧
∧∀c (cεingr(a) →∃d (dεingr(c) ∧∃e (eεb ∧dεingr(e)))))
The remaining two axioms employ the notion of a class:
Axiom III
∀b (∃a aεb →∃c cεcl(b))
Axiom III may be meta-linguistically read as stating that any non-empty name gen-
erates its class.
Axiom IV
∀a, b, c (aεcl(b) ∧cεcl(b) →aεc)
Axiom IV states that a given name generates at most one class.
5.2.2 Axiomatization from 1918
Quite soon Le´sniewski became dissatisﬁed with the fact that his formulation
employed deﬁned terms in two of its axioms.16 Thus, in 1918 he made a modiﬁcation
described in his paper (Le´sniewski 1930a). Deﬁnitions I, II and III and axioms I and
II remain untouched. Axioms III and IV are replaced by:
Axiom C
∀a, b, d [bεb ∧dεd →∀c (cεa →((cεb ∧bεc) ∨cεprt(b))) ∧
∧∀c (cεa →((cεd ∧dεc) ∨cεprt(d))) ∧∀e (eεprt(b) ∨eεprt(d) →
→∃f ((( f εe ∧eεf ) ∨f εprt(d)) ∧( f εa ∨∃c (cεa ∧f εprt(c))))) →bεd]
Axiom D
∀a [∃c cεa →∃b (∀d (dεa →(dεb ∧bεd) ∨dεprt(b)) ∧
∧∀d (dεprt(b) →∃c (((cεd ∧dεc) ∨cεprt(d)) ∧(cεa ∨∃e (eεa ∧cεprt(e))))))]
Axiom C looks somewhat complicated, but its intuitive sense is not so difﬁcult.
Less formally speaking, it says that if:
15 Since cl(a) is the mereological fusion of all those objects that are a, I will use ‘the class of a’ and
‘the class of a’s’ interchangeably. By the former use I want to emphasize that it is a class determined
by a single name a and by the latter I want to highlight that it is nothing above and beyond the
objects that a already denotes, considered as one individual object.
16 Keep in mind that making your axiomatization as simple as possible was the name of the game in
Le´sniewski’s days. People not only wanted to have as few axioms as possible, but they also wanted
their axioms to contain as few symbols as possible. One of the mysteries in the history of logic
is why anyone actually cared about things like replacing an axiom with another axiom, say, two
symbols shorter, and proving they were equivalent.

5.2 Axiomatizations
121
1. b and d are objects (bεb ∧dεd):
2. any object c which is a is an ingredient of b:
∀c (cεa →((cεb ∧bεc) ∨cεprt(d)))
(by Deﬁnition I, c is an ingredient of b iff either it is identical to b (cεb ∧bεc),
or it is a part of d.)
3. any a is an ingredient of d:
∀c (cεa →((cεd ∧dεc) ∨cεprt(d)))
4. any part of either b or d:
∀e (eεprt(b) ∨eεprt(d) →
has an ingredient:
∃f ((( f εe ∧eεf ) ∨f εprt(d))∧
which either is a
( f εa∨
or is a part of one of a’s:
∃c (cεa ∧f εprt(c)))
then b is d (bεd).
So, the axiom says that if b and d are two classes (in Le´sniewski’s sense) of a’s,
then they are identical (in fact, this is pretty much a restatement of Axiom IV, but
without the use of deﬁned terms).
Axiom D (when we introduce the notion of ingredient using deﬁnition I) may be
read as stating that if at least one object is a, then there is an object such that all
objects a are its ingredients and every part of it has an ingredient which is an a or an
ingredient of an a. In other words: if at least one object is a, then there is a class of
objects a.
This formulation is not deeply innovative. It is easy to see that axiom D results
from axiom III if we eliminate from it the notions of ingredient and class using
deﬁnitions I and III. For Axiom III says that for any b, if there is an a such that aεb
(i.e. b is non–empty), there is an object which is a class of b’s (I used the indeﬁnite
article because the axiom does not imply that such a class is unique). When we use
Deﬁnition III, the consequent of Axiom III reads:
∃c [cεc ∧∀d (dεb →dεingr(c)) ∧∀d (dεingr(c) →∃e (eεingr(d)∧
∧∃f ( f εb ∧eεingr( f ))))]

122
5
Le´sniewski’s Mereology
Now, using Deﬁnition I we replace every expression of the form αεingr(β) with
(αεβ ∧βεα) ∨αεprt(β), and we get a formula which pretty much is Axiom D. The
only difference is that it contains cεc in the consequent. This, however, is logically
redundant, because ∃a aεb together with ∀d (dεb →dεingr(c)) already imply
∃d dεingr(c) which can be true only if c is a singular term, that is only if cεc.
5.2.3 Axiomatization from 1920
In (1930a) Le´sniewski discussed a formulation of Mereology dating from 1920 which
takes ‘is an ingredient’ as a primitive term. This formulation is equivalent to the
previous formulations. It has four axioms:
Axiom (a)
∀a, b (aεingr(b) ∧¬bεa →bε ∼a)
Axiom (b)
∀a, b, c (aεingr(b) ∧bεingr(c) →aεingr(c))
Axiom (c)
∀a, c, d [∀b (bεa →bεingr(c) ∧bεingr(d)) ∧
∧∀b (bεingr(c) ∨bεingr(d) →∃e (eεingr(b) ∧
∧∃f, g ( f εingr(g) ∧gεa ∧eεingr( f )))) →cεd]
Axiom (d)
∀a [∃c cεa →∃b (∀d (dεa →dεingr(b)) ∧
∧∀d (dεingr(b) →∃c (cεingr(d) ∧∃e (eεa ∧cεingr(e)))))]
and parthood is deﬁned by:
Deﬁnition (e)
∀a, b (aεprt(b) ≡aεingr(b) ∧¬(aεb ∧bεa))
The deﬁnition of class is the same as Deﬁnition III in the version from 1916.
Again, there seems to be nothing essentially new about this formulation. It takes
another expression as a primitive, but the reformulation of its axioms is a quite
straightforward translation of axioms occurring in previous formulations. And so,
Axiom (a), given Deﬁnition (e), has the same intuitive content as Axiom I. Axiom (b),
considering the same deﬁnition easily implies Axiom II. Indeed, Axiom (b) seems
just to be ‘a reﬂexive closure’ of the assumption of transitivity from axiom II. Axiom
(c) is just another formulation of the extensionality statement, present already in
Axiom IV. Axiom (d), if we use deﬁnition III turns out to boil down to Axiom IV.
5.2.4 Axiomatization from 1921
In (1931a) Le´sniewski discusses another, equivalent formulation which takes
‘exterior to’ as a primitive. Two objects are exterior to each other if and only if
they have no overlapping parts.17 There are two axioms:
17 What he published in 1931 is nevertheless referred to as the 1921 axiomatization, since this seems
to be the year when it was formulated. This difference arose from the fact that Le´sniewski lingered
with the publication of his results.

5.2 Axiomatizations
123
Axiom
A ∀a, b [aεext(b) ≡∀c (cεc →
→∃d ((dεext(a) ∨dεext(b)) ∧dε ∼ext(c)))]
Axiom
B ∀a, φ [∀b [bεφ(a) ≡bεb ∧∃d dεa ∧
∧∀c (bεext(c) ≡∀d (dεa →dεext(c)))] →
→φ(a)εφ(a)]
Axiom A can be read as saying that two objects, a and b are exterior to each other
if and only if for any object c there is an object d which overlaps with c but which
does not overlap with either a or b. To grasp intuitively why the equivalence holds,
consider the following. From right to left: suppose a and b are not exterior to each
other. This means that they have a common part. Call it c. But then, there is no d
overlapping with c which does not overlap with a and b. For the opposite direction,
suppose there is a c such that any d which overlaps with c, overlaps both with a and
b. This means that c is a common ingredient of a and b and hence, a and b overlap.
Axiom B may be taken to state that if something is a, then there is a class of a’s.
Basically what it says is this: suppose you deﬁne a name–forming functor of one
name argument, φ, by saying that it names any object b such that (a) if an object c is
exterior to all the a’s, b is exterior to c, and (b) if b is exterior to an object c, then c
is exterior to all the a’s. Part (a) means that b has no ingredient outside of the fusion
of the a’s. Part (b) means that there is no part of the fusion of all the a’s which is
exterior to b. Together, they mean that b is the maximal object which has all a’s as its
ingredients. That is, b is their fusion. So, given that ‘φ(a)’ is deﬁned as ‘the fusion
of a’s’, Axiom B says that if a itself is non–empty then there is exactly one fusion
of a’s (‘φ(a)εφ(a)’ is true only if there is exactly one object denoted by ‘φ(a)’).
The notions of a class and of an ingredient can be easily deﬁned:
Deﬁnition
C ∀a, b [bεcl(a) ≡bεb ∧∀c (bεext(c) ≡∀d (dεa →dεext(c)))]
This reads: b is a class of a’s iff b is an object and it is exterior to an object c if and
only if this object is exterior to all the a’s. It is easy to see that this deﬁniens occurs
in Axiom B.
Deﬁnition
D ∀a, b [aεingr(b) ≡∃c (bεcl(c) ∧aεc)]
This deﬁnition says that an object a is an ingredient of an object b if and only if for
some c, b is a class of c’s and a is one of the c’s. The parthood relation is deﬁned as
in Deﬁnition (e).
This axiomatization interestingly diverges from the previous ones and the proof
of their equivalence (given by Le´sniewski in the same paper) is rather non-trivial.
5.2.5 Some Other Conditions of Being a Class
K. Kuratowski and A. Tarski formulated three other possible deﬁnitions of class,
equivalent to the one used originally by Le´sniewski. These results are described in
Le´sniewski (1930a).

124
5
Le´sniewski’s Mereology
Kuratowski’s deﬁnition is:
Deﬁnition a
∀a, b [bεcl(a) ≡∀c (cεa →cεingr(b)) ∧
∧∀c (∀d (dεa →dεingr(c)) ∧cεingr(b) →bεc ∧cεb)]
Roughly speaking, it says that an object b is cl(a) if (1) it mereologically contains
all the a’s, and (2) whatever mereologically contains all a’s and is an ingredient of
b simply is b. So, for instance if you take a clay statue, call it ‘Jay’, Jay will be the
class of ‘all clay pieces constituting the statue’ since whatever is such a clay piece
is an ingredient of Jay, and any object which mereologically contains the fusion of
all such clay pieces and itself is an ingredient of Jay simply is Jay (this suggests
that plain classical mereology is not the best framework for the constitution-identity
debate).
Two deﬁnitions suggested by Tarski are:
Deﬁnition b
∀a, b [bεcl(a) ≡∀c (cεa →cεingr(b)) ∧
∧∀c (∀d (dεa →dεingr(c)) →bεingr(c)))]
Deﬁnition c
∀a, b [bεcl(a) ≡bεb ∧∀c (∀d (dεa →
→dεingr(c)) ≡bεingr(c))]
Tarski’s Deﬁnition b is slightly different from Kuratowski’s. It says that b is a
class of a’s if it mereologically contains all a’s, and is mereologically contained in
any object that mereologically contains all a’s.
Deﬁnition c on the other hand says that for b to be a class of a’s it is enough that
(1) b is an object, that (2) it is an ingredient of anything that contains mereologically
all a’s, and that (3) if it is an ingredient of an object c, this object mereologically
contains all a’s.
5.3 Mereology as a Replacement for Set Theory
Le´sniewski intended to develop Mereology as an alternative to classical set theory. In
the series of papers in which he described various axiomatizations of Mereology he
also proved numerous theorems that are intended as analogues of certain theorems
of set theory. Although his proofs are not wholly formalized, they are clear enough
to see that they can be fully formalized. Also, an interesting aspect of Le´sniewski’s
proofs in Mereology is that he clearly uses a strategy typical for natural deduction
(freezing variables, assuming the antecedent and proving the consequent in order to
prove the whole conditional), even though the ofﬁcial deductive system developed
by him does not allow for this kind of moves. Nowadays it is a common practice,
but those days it stood in clear contrast with the more common strategy of proving
theorems within a system in the Hilbert-style fashion.18
18 It is said that Le´sniewski eventually became dissatisﬁed with Mereology as a system of founda-
tions of mathematics. He did not publish such a comment anywhere, and the information seems to
come from secondary sources. For instance (Kearns 1962, 35) says: “Le´sniewski did not give up

5.3 Mereology as a Replacement for Set Theory
125
I will now give and describe those theorems of Mereology proven by Le´sniewski
which are crucial for one of his stronger theorems in Mereology, an analogue of
Cantor’s theorem. (Almost all theorems I will describe have been given and proven
by Le´sniewski. Occasionally I will also mention fairly trivial consequences of his
theorems.)
This analogue states that if a name a names more than one object, and the objects
it names do not overlap, then there are more sets of a’s than objects a’s. So, for
instance, if I have ﬁve (obviously, non overlapping) lizards, and I name this little
herd ‘Aldos’, then the theorem implies that there are more than ﬁve sets of Aldos.
Going over a few theorems on our way will also help us understand the expressive
power of the language of Mereology. Simultaneously I will also discuss those theo-
rems which show how Mereology differs from set theory. For the sake of accessibility
I replace proofs given by Le´sniewski with informal explanations. The reader is free
to look at detailed proofs in Le´sniewski’s own writings. (Those who are eager to see
some examples of proofs, I beg to wait till Chap.7.) Numbering of the following
theorems and deﬁnitions has nothing to do with the names assigned by Le´sniewski,
but in footnotes I give detailed references to the original formulations. For theorems
proven by Le´sniewski I provide references in footnotes.
Among some simple theorems which involve the notions of parthood and ingre-
dient are:
∀a (aεa →aε¬prt(a))
(5.1)
which states that no object is part of itself.19 It easily follows from Axiom I.
∀a (aεa →aεingr(a))
(5.2)
that is, every object is an ingredient of itself.20 Deﬁnition I implies:21
∀a, b (aεprt(b) →aεingr(b))
(5.3)
which means that every part of an object is also its ingredient. Also, the relation of
being an ingredient is transitive:22
∀a, b, c (aεingr(b) ∧bεingr(c) →aεingr(c))
(5.4)
his claims that it [Mereology] is intuitively acceptable, but he did realize that it cannot replace set

Le´sniewski’s Mereology
If one object is an ingredient of another object, they have at least one ingredient in
common:23
∀a, b (aεingr(b) →∃c (cεingr(a) ∧cεingr(b)))
(5.5)
If an object a is an ingredient of another object b, then a has an ingredient which is
an ingredient of an ingredient of b:24
∀a, b (aεingr(b) →∃d (dεingr(b) ∧∃c (cεingr(a) ∧cεingr(d))))
(5.6)
Given the Le´sniewskian understanding of the notions of class and set, clearly
every class is a set:25
∀a, b (aεcl(b) →aεset(b))
(5.7)
Every object is the class of its own ingredients:26
∀a (aεa →aεcl(ingr(a)))
(5.8)
and whatever has a part is the class of its own parts:27
∀b (∃a aεprt(b) →bεcl(prt(a)))
(5.9)
The identiﬁcation of a singleton with its element (mentioned before) is also
provable:28
(aεa →aεcl(a))
(5.10)
The deﬁnition of being an element abides by the intuition that for a to be an element
of a class b there has to be some c, such that b is the class of c, and a is c:
Def. (el)
∀a, b [aεel(b) ≡∃c (bεcl(c) ∧aεc)]
Interestingly, if a is an ingredient of b, then by (5.8) there is a name ingr(b) such
that bεcl(ingr(b)) and aεingr(b), and thus a is an element of b:29
∀a, b (aεingr(b) →aεel(b))
(5.11)
Also, if a is an element of b, then there is some c such that bεcl(c) and aεb, and thus a
is an ingredient of b (for, by deﬁnition III, if b is cl(c), then every c is its ingredient):30

127
∀a, b [aεel(b) →aεingr(b)]
(5.12)
Theorems (5.11) and (5.12) together identify being an element of a class with
being its ingredient. This identiﬁcation implies the reﬂexivity and transitivity of
being an element:31
∀a (aεa →aεel(a))
(5.13)
∀a, b, c (aεel(b) ∧bεel(c) →aεel(c))
(5.14)
The class of sets of b is the class of b’s:32
∀a, b (aεcl(set(b)) →aεcl(b))
(5.15)
Any set of b is an ingredient of the class of b’s:33
∀a, b (aεset(b) →aεingr(cl(b)))
(5.16)
Any class of b’s is a class of sets of b’s:34
∀a, b (aεcl(b) →aεcl(set(b)))
(5.17)
From (5.7) and the identiﬁcation of being an ingredient with being an element it
follows that every object is the class of its elements:35
∀a (aεa →aεcl(el(a)))
(5.18)
Theorem (5.13) implies that every object is an element of itself. Note also that for
any a there is at most one class of a’s:
∀a, b, c (aεcl(c) ∧bεcl(c) →aεb)
(5.19)
Now, if a is a class of b’s, it is unique. Thus, being an object, by (5.13) it is an element
of itself. That is, every class has at least one element: itself.36
∀a, b (aεcl(b) →aεel(a))
(5.20)
Therefore, there is no empty class.

Le´sniewski’s Mereology
¬∃a ∀b ¬bεel(a)
(5.21)
One can deﬁne a name: ‘a class which is not an element of itself’:
Def. (r)
∀a [aεr ≡aεa ∧¬aεel(a) ∧∃b aεcl(b)]
The class of classes which are not elements of themselves would be cl(r). But, since
every class is an element of itself and no class is empty, cl(r) does not exist:37
¬∃a aεcl(r)
(5.22)
The notions of subset and proper subset are deﬁned as follows:
Def. (subset)
∀a, b (aεsubset(b) ≡aεa ∧∀c (cεel(a) →cεel(b)))
Def. (psubset)
∀a, b (aεpsubset(b) ≡aεsubset(b) ∧¬bεa)
Those notions are not very fascinating, though:38
∀a, b (aεsubset(b) ≡aεingr(b))
(5.23)
∀a, b (aεpsubset(b) ≡aεprt(b))
(5.24)
∀a, b (aεsubset(b) ≡aεel(b))
(5.25)
It is also possible to deﬁne ‘the universe’. First, we have to deﬁne the name
‘object’:
Def. (obj)
∀a (aεobj ≡aεa)
and now we say that the universe is the class of all objects:39
Def. (U)
∀a (aεU ≡aεa ∧aεcl(obj))
In the ﬁrst paper on Mereology (Le´sniewski 1916) there is an interesting confusion
which shows that Le´sniewski was not clear as to the logical foundations of his system.
Theorem XLIII (Le´sniewski 1916, 159) claims that some object is the class of non-
contradictory objects. The informal proof is:
In agreement with the law of non-contradiction we may state that every object is a non-
contradictory object. It follows from this that some object is a non-contradictory object, from
which—in accordance with Axiom III—the given theorem results. (Le´sniewski 1916, 159)
Theorem XLIV (p. 160) states that the class of non-contradictory objects is the
universe.
37 A slight reformulation of Theorem XXVI, (Le´sniewski 1916, 150).
38 These are obvious consequences of Theorems XXVIII–XXXI, (Le´sniewski 1916, 152–155).
39 Deﬁnition VII, (Le´sniewski 1916, 159).

5.3 Mereology as a Replacement for Set Theory
129
Neither XLIII nor XLIV actually are theorems of Mereology. They both imply
that there exists at least one object. However, in the empty domain all axioms of
Ontology and Mereology are valid and all rules are truth–preserving (or, in other
words, the axiomatic basis of Le´sniewski’s systems does not contain unconditional
existential statements).40 So, the alleged Theorems XLIII and XLIV imply something
that Mereology does not imply.
In formulations other than that from 1921 the notion of being exterior can be
deﬁned as follows:41
Def. (ext)
∀a, b (aεext(b) ≡aεa ∧∀c (cεingr(b) →¬cεingr(a)))
Thus, a is exterior to b iff a is an object which has no common ingredients with b.
The notion of a relative complement is also deﬁnable. The idea is that a is a
complement of b respective to c (that is, a is c “minus” b) iff b is a part of c and a
is the class of those parts of c which are exterior to b:42
Def. (compl)
∀a, b, c [aεcompl(b, c) ≡bεsubset(c) ∧∃d (aεcl(d) ∧
∧∀e (eεd ≡eεel(c) ∧eεext(b)))]
Clearly, if a is a part of b, then there is a’s complement relative to b:43
∀a, b (aεprt(b) →∃c (cεcompl(a, b)))
(5.26)
Some fairly simple theorems which relate the notions of parthood and complement
are:44
∀a, b, c (aεcompl(b, c) →aεext(b))
(5.27)
∀a, b, c (aεcompl(b, c) →aεprt(c))
(5.28)
∀a, b, c (aεcompl(b, c) →bεprt(c))
(5.29)
Also, no object is a complement of itself with respect to any class, neither is it
the complement of a class with respect to itself, and no class is the complement of a
class with respect to that class:45
¬∃a, b [aεcompl(a, b)]
(5.30)
¬∃a, b [aεcompl(b, a)]
(5.31)
¬∃a, b [aεcompl(b, b)]
(5.32)

Le´sniewski’s Mereology
Another interesting notion is the notion of a sum of two exterior objects:46
Def. (+)
∀a, b, c [aεb + c ≡aεcl(b ∪c) ∧bεext(c)]
where ∀a, b, c (aεb ∪c ≡aεb ∨aεc). That is, a is the sum of two exterior objects
b and c iff a is the class of things which are b or c. It is provable that for any a and
b at most one object is a + b,47 and that if a is exterior to b, there exists an object
which is a + b:48
∀a, b, c, d (aεb + c ∧dεb + c →aεd)
(5.33)
∀a, b (aεext(b) →∃c cεa + b)
(5.34)
A generalization of + is the notion of sum:49
Def. (sum)
∀a, b [aεsum(b) ≡aεcl(b) ∧∀c, d (cεb ∧dεb →
→cεd ∨cεext(d))]
Say b is a name which names only pairwise exterior objects. Then the sum of b’s is
the class of b’s.
Probably the most interesting theorem of Mereology given by Le´sniewski is the
one that corresponds to Cantor’s theorem in classical set theory. To be able to formu-
late it, we ﬁrst have to deﬁne two Ontological concepts: equinumerosity and ‘being
fewer than’.50
First, objects a are as numerous as objects b (a ≃b) iff there is some constant τ
of category n
n such that all the conditions below hold:
∀c (cεa →∃d (dεb ∧dετ(c)))
∀d (dεb →∃c (cεa ∧dετ(c)))
∀c, d, e (cεa ∧dεb ∧eεb ∧dετ(c) ∧eετ(c) →dεe ∧eεd)
∀c, d, e (cεa ∧dεa ∧eεb ∧eετ(c) ∧eετ(d) →cεd ∧dεc)
It is not too difﬁcult to notice that the ﬁrst condition says that τ relates each object
which is a to an object which is b (that is, that τ is total on a’s), the second condition
says that each object which is b is the “value” of τ for some object which is a (that
τ is onto b), the third condition says that τ is functional (that it doesn’t relate an
a-object to more than one b-object), and the last condition requires that τ should be
an injection.
The second deﬁned notion is that of objects a being fewer than objects b. There
are fewer a’s than b’s iff the following two conditions are both satisﬁed:
46 Deﬁnition VIII, (Le´sniewski 1929b, 295).
47 Theorem CLIII, (Le´sniewski 1929b, 296).
48 Theorem CLV, (Le´sniewski 1929b, 297).
49 Deﬁnition IX, (Le´sniewski 1929b, 302).
50 Those are explained in footnote 14, (Le´sniewski 1929b, 311).

5.3 Mereology as a Replacement for Set Theory
131
∃c [∀d (dεc →dεb) ∧a ≃c]
∀c [∀d (dεc →dεa) →¬b ≃c]
The ﬁrst requirement is that a is equinumerous to a certain name c which is weakly
included in b. The second is that b is not equinumerous to any name c which is
weakly included in a.
If we write ‘objects a are fewer than objects b’ as ‘a < b’, the “Cantorian”
theorem in question is:51
∀a [∀b, c (bεa ∧cεa →cεb ∨cεext(b)) ∧
∧∃b, c (bεa ∧cεa ∧¬bεc) →a < set(a)]
What this states may intuitively be grasped as follows. Let a be a ‘discrete’ name,
that is, if it names more than one object, those objects have no parts in common. If,
moreover, the name names more than one object, then there are more sets of a’s than
objects a. For example, suppose that ‘a’ names exactly two stones: b and c, exterior
to each other. How many objects a are there? Two. b and c. How many sets of a are
there? At least three: b itself, c itself and the sum of b and c are all sets of a. Is, say,
a half of b a set of a’s? No. According to deﬁnition II, any set of a’s has to have at
least one object a as its ingredient. How about the sum of b and a half of c? If it was
a set of a’s, then every ingredient of it would have to have one ingredient e such that
e would have been an ingredient of an ingredient of one of the a’s, which would also
have to be an ingredient of this sum itself. But the half of c is not an ingredient of
an ingredient of any object a which is an ingredient of the sum in question. So, it
seems, there are exactly three sets of a’s and only two objects a.
Mereology was constructed by Le´sniewski, as he explicitly stated, to provide an
alternative form of the foundation of mathematics. This new system indeed provides
an interesting theory of classes, at least in one sense of this word.
Unfortunately, neither Le´sniewski nor later developments have shown that Mere-
ology actually constitutes a foundation of mathematics in any sense remotely similar
to that in which classical set theory does. The last theorem of this section is proba-
bly the most mathematically interesting theorem of Mereology that Le´sniewski has
proven. On the other hand, some quasi-mathematical concepts, like equinumerosity,
are already deﬁnable in Ontology. Le´sniewskian scholars sometimes put it by saying
that number is an Ontological concept.
What exactly would Mereology have to be like to succeed as a system of foun-
dations of mathematics, or at least as a replacement for set theory? Considering
the importance of classical set theory nowadays I would conjecture that Mereology
would be successful if (a) a theory isomorphic with one of standard set theories
were a sub–theory of Mereology (or of a nominalistically acceptable extension of
it), and yet (b) Mereology would not be committed to abstract objects. Restriction
(b) results from Le´sniewski’s nominalistic assumptions. Restriction (a) is not exactly
51 Theorem CXCVIII, (Le´sniewski 1929b, 313).

Le´sniewski’s Mereology
Le´sniewskian. Of course, from what we know, he attempted to prove mereological
analogues of certain theorems of the standard set theory. So, if we wanted to be
more in accordance with Le´sniewski’s intuitions, we should require that Mereology
be able to prove analogues of major theorems of set theory. The problem with this
formulation is that the notion of a mereological analogue of a major set–theoretic
theorem is fairly vague. I would suggest (a) as a nowadays reasonable requirement
for quite simple pragmatical reasons. There have been thousands of mathematicians
who believe set theory makes sense and who use set theory in their everyday research
practice. Of course, one can go ahead and say that this theory simply does not make
sense and people who are using it are all mistaken, but this would be quite a strong
claim. Rather, I am inclined to believe, considering the abundance of set theoretic
content in various meta–logical and mathematical contexts, one of the tasks of a per-
son who constructs a foundational system is to explain the meaning of the theory, not
to try to explain the theory away. Hence, if one starts with saying that, for instance,
it does not even make sense to use the expression ‘the empty set’ instead of trying to
explain how it is possible that this expression makes sense, one puts forward a very
revolutionary approach to the problems.
Such a revolutionary strategy might be suspected of not being a foundations of
mathematics itself, but rather an attempt to construct a new mathematical theory. The
issue here resembles the qualms concerning intuitionism raised by Chihara. In a way,
Heyting, who views the existence assertions of classical mathematics as metaphysical
and vague, can be interpreted as putting forward a program which simply banishes
such assertions from mathematics. Heyting constructs a logical system in which the
existential quantiﬁer is accounted for in terms of assertability conditions (‘∃x P(x)’
can be asserted only if one can specify a mathematical object o of which it can be
truly said that P(o)). Chihara suggests that ‘Intuitionism is not so much a philosophy
of mathematics as it is the construction of a new kind of mathematics’ (Chihara 1990,
22). He says:
…philosophy of mathematics is, and should be, directed at understanding actual mathemat-
ics, and dealing with the philosophical problems arising out of the enormous role (actual)
mathematics plays in everyday life and in science. When Heyting turned his back on classical
mathematics and gave up trying to understand classical mathematical assertions, he in effect
gave up philosophy of mathematics! (Chihara 1990, 23)
In a similar manner, if one simply disregards set theory and thinks of Mereology as the
correct theory of classes, it seems that one no longer is concerned with foundations
of what nowadays is classical mathematic, but rather one intends to develop a wholly
different theory whose foundational role is quite unclear.52
52 Peter Simons points out: “Le´sniewski’s alternative to set theory is based on the (justiﬁed) assump-
tion: If you follow me in what you mean by ‘member’ and ‘set’ you will not get into logical trouble.
That is true, but the proponents of inconsistent set theory were doing more than trying to stay out
of trouble (which is why they got into it in the ﬁrst place): they were trying to provide a logical
foundation for mathematics, some of them with a view to showing at least part of mathematics to be
just logic. Le´sniewski’s weaker system may, or, more likely, may not be adequate to that purpose.”
(Simons 1993, 7)

5.3 Mereology as a Replacement for Set Theory
133
This does not mean that Mereology as a separate theory is useless. It turned out
to be interesting in quite a few different ﬁelds: linguists sometimes use it when they
discuss semantics of mass terms and philosophers speak of parts when they speak
about persistence, perdurance and other issues discussed in modern metaphysics.
5.4 Further Readings
Papers concerned with Mereology divide into a few groups. Some of them constitute
either an introduction or a philosophical discussion of the system. Others contain
mostly results obtained within the axiomatic system of Mereology. Some are con-
cerned with properties of Mereology as a logical system—among those a special role
is played by papers whose authors discuss the novelty of Mereology (its critics claim
that the system is very similar to other known systems and its advocates empha-
size the differences). Another group of papers is concerned with systems based on
Mereology. I will brieﬂy discuss the relevant papers in this order.
Perhaps the most accessible introduction to Mereology is Soboci´nski (1954a).
Asenjo (1977) discusses the historical role that Le´sniewski’s Mereology played in the
development of non–classical set theories. Lorenz (1977) elaborates on the interplay
between the partition of a whole into parts and the attribution of properties to an
object. Probably the most up–to–date comprehensive book (in German) discussing
mereologies is Ridder (2002). Another book whose part may serve as a textbook
(in English) is Simons (1987), although Simons is focusing on developing his own,
non-extensional mereology.
Just like it was the case with Le´sniewski’s other systems, some researchers devoted
their attention to obtaining simpler axiomatizations of Mereology. Various formula-
tions were offered by Lejewski (1954a, 1955, 1962). Clay (1961) is concerned with
obtaining new theorems of Mereology and simplifying its axiomatic basis. Clay
(1970) shows that one of axiomatizations given by Lejewski contains a redundant
axiom.
Clay (1973) discusses a deﬁnition of the class operator simpler than that given
initially by Le´sniewski. Le´sniewski himself gave the following simpliﬁcation:
∀a, b [aεcl(b) ≡aεa ∧∀c (b ⊆el(c) ≡aεel(c))]
However, his proof of its equivalence to the original deﬁnition, as originally given
(Le´sniewski 1930a), depends on the deﬁnition of a set (recall that deﬁnitions in
Le´sniewski’s systems are creative). Soboci´nski is reported to have asked the question:
does the equivalence proof depend on the deﬁnition essentially? Or, in other words:
is the use of this deﬁnition in the proof creative? Clay (1973) proves that the answer
to this question is negative.
The consistency of Mereology has been proven by Clay (1968). Clay constructs
a model of Mereology in which the domain is taken to be the set of all real numbers
whose decimal expansions contain only zeros and ones with the exception of the

134
5
Le´sniewski’s Mereology
number 0. Name variables range over subsets of this set. The epsilon has the standard
interpretation and prt(a) is non–empty only if a is assigned a singleton. In this case
it denotes the set of all those numbers x in the domain which for every position where
the object belonging to the singleton assigned to a has a 1 in its decimal expansion,
x has 1 at the same position too. In a way, this is a proof that if Ontology enriched
with the axioms for real numbers is consistent, so is Mereology.
Lejewski (1969) noticed that this might be interpreted as proving consistency of
a fairly simple theory which depends on the consistency of a less intuitively obvi-
ous theory. Hence, he focuses on proving the consistency of Mereology relative to a
weaker subsystem of Mereology itself. The consistency of Ontology has been proven
by a member of Le´sniewski’s seminar before the war.53 If we interpret ontological
variables as protothetical variables,54 and we interpret ε as the functor of conjunction,
the theory becomes a sub–theory of Protothetic.55 Lejewski proved that if we addi-
tionally interpret el (element of) as the protothetical assertion operator, Mereology
becomes a sub–theory of Protothetic as well.
Clay (1974b) provides (indirectly) another consistency proof. He shows how the
standard Euclidean 3–dimensional topological spaces provide a model for atomless
Mereology. Since the classical Mereology is its subsystem, this proves consistency
of Mereology relative to topology.
Grzegorczyk (1955) argued that the models of Mereology are just complete
Boolean algebras with zeros deleted.56 In a similar manner, Kubi´nski in his remark
published in 1968 points out that cl(a) may be taken in the algebraic interpretation
(i.e. when we take the language of Ontology, interpret it in Boolean algebras by
53 It is not clear who gave the proof, though.
54 That is, if we interpret name variables as propositional variables and variables of category
σ
σ1,...,σn
as variables of category
σ ′
σ ′
1,...,σ ′n where σ ′ and the categories σ ′
i result from σ and categories σi by
replacing all n’s by s’s.
55 Directives of Ontology become directives of Protothetic under that interpretation as well.
56 A Boolean algebra is a set A with two binary operators ∧(meet) and ∨(join), a unary operation
¬ (complement) which contains two elements 0 and 1, such that for any x, y, z ∈A the following
hold:
x ∨(y ∨z) = (x ∨y) ∨z x ∧(y ∧z) = (x ∧y) ∧z
x ∨y = y ∨x
x ∧y = y ∧xr
x ∨(x ∧y) = x
x ∧(x ∨y) = x
x ∨(y ∧z) = (x ∨y) ∧(x ∨z) x ∧(y ∨z) = (x ∧y) ∨(x ∧z)
x ∨¬x = 1 x ∧¬x = 0
The ordering relation is put on a Boolean algebra by taking:
a ≤b ⇔a = a ∧b
Now, we say that a subset B of an Boolean algebra A has a supremum if and only if there is an
x ∈A such that for all y ∈B y ≤x, and that for any z ∈B for which y ≤z for any y ∈B, it is
the case that x ≤z. We say that A is a complete Boolean algebra if and only if every subset of A
has a supremum (in A).

assigning subsets of the algebra to name variables) to be the least upper bound of the
a’s. These claims were criticized by Clay (1974a) on the point that what Grzegorczyk
(or Kubi´nski, for that matter) reconstructed was not Le´sniewski’s Mereology. First
of all, variables in the system discussed by Grzegorczyk were individual variables.
Secondly, Grzegorczyk’s quantiﬁcation was ﬁrst–order only. Another difference is
that mereological models can be empty, whereas a complete Boolean algebra has
to contain non-zero elements.57 Asenjo (1977) remarks that Grzegorczyk’s analogy
breaks down if one does not require that Mereology has to be atomistic (Le´sniewski’s
Mereology did not require the existence of atoms).
Słupecki (1958) can be interpreted as a similar attack against the novelty of Mere-
ology. Słupecki hints that Mereology does not differ formally from a certain elemen-
tary theory of partial ordering. However, he formulates it with Chwistek’s simple
type theory as underlying logic, which as Clay (1974a) points out, ‘fails to include
Ontology or any other theory of the distributive class to use as counterpoint for the
notion of collective class.’
At least two straightforward modiﬁcations of Mereology are available. First, it is
possible to add an axiom stating that every object is either an atom or is constructed
from those atoms which are its parts, or one can add an axiom stating that no atoms
exist. The former extension of Mereology has been dubbed ‘Atomistic Mereology’
and studied by Soboci´nski (1971). Both atomistic and atomless Mereologies have
been provided with fairly simple axiomatizations by Clay (1975).
A system of mereology inspired by Le´sniewski’s Mereology has been constructed
by Goodman and Leonard (1940). It is weaker than Mereology.
Richard Milton Martin attempted to develop a systematic approach to linguistic
and multiple reference in the framework of a system of mereology (Martin 1988,
1992).
Some papers discuss the possible role that Mereology can play in foundations of
mathematics. Clay (1965) introduces the notion of weak discreteness:58
∀a [w-dscr(a) ⇔∀b, c, d, e [(dεcl(b) ∧eεcl(c) ∧b ⊆a ∧c ⊆a ∧d = e) →
→∀a (aεb ≡aεc)]]
57 By a non–zero element I mean an element which is not only a zero in an algebra. According to
this nomenclature, an object which is both 0 and 1 is a non-zero element.
58 It is contrasted with the strong notion of discreteness, given by
∀a [dscr(a) ≡∀c, d (cεa ∧dεa →c = d ∨cεex(d))]
where ex is deﬁned by:
∀c, d (cεex(d) ≡∀b (bεel(c) →¬bεel(d)))
This condition says that a possible name a is discrete iff for any two possible names that uniquely
name individuals named by a, they either name the same individual, or they name objects which
have no common part.

Le´sniewski’s Mereology
The condition states that a possible name a is weakly discrete iff for any two names
that name some of the objects named by a, if they differ on the objects that they
name, their (mereological) classes are different. He shows that if the condition of
weakdiscreteness is satisﬁed, classes behaveincertainaspects likedistributivesets.59
Clay proves an analogue of (5.35) (see p. 20), but instead of using the strong dis-
creteness in the antecedent, he requires only that a name be weakly discrete. He also
proved that if two equinumerous names a and b are weakly discrete, there are as
many sets of a’s as there are sets of b’s (see Deﬁnition II on p. 9 for details regarding
Le´sniewski’s understanding of sets). The crucial result proven by Clay, however, is
the meta–theorem saying that for any formula φ involving only a1, . . . , an as name
variables, equinumerosity and ‘denoting fewer objects’ operator, and ﬁnally, the set
operator, any conditional with σ as its consequent and a formula which states strong
discreteness of a1, . . . , an:
∀a1, . . . , an (dscr(a1) ∧· · · ∧dscr(an) →φ)
is equivalent to a conditional with the same consequent, but whose antecedent states
the weak discreteness of a1, . . . , an:
∀a1, . . . , an (w-dscr(a1) ∧· · · ∧w-dscr(an) →φ)
Le´sniewskian scholars have been concerned with related issues for a while.
Soboci´nski is reported (Clay 1972) to have proven that if a is discrete (in the strong
sense), then if a names ﬁnitely many objects, there are ﬁnitely many sets of a’s.
Clay himself (1972) proves that this condition holds even without the assumption of
discreteness of a.
Słupecki (1958) attempted to modify Mereology in order to obtain a theory that
could play the role of standard set theory but which would not commit one to sets.
As it turns out, this strategy is not devoid of difﬁculties. Sect.7.8 contains a wider
discussion of this subject.

Chapter 6
Le´sniewski and Deﬁnitions
Chapter Written with Severi K. Hämäri
Abstract We indicate, document and attack a popular misunderstanding about
Le´sniewski and deﬁnitions, according to which it was Le´sniewski who came up with
the consistency and conservativeness requirements on deﬁnitions. After some pre-
liminaries we explain the origins of the folklore, elaborate on Le´sniewski’s unusual
style which contributed to the obscurity of his works, explain why Le´sniewski’s
deﬁnitions are creative, and what Le´sniewski’s rules for deﬁnitions actually accom-
plished. Finally, we argue that most of the credit on the Polish ground should go to
Łukasiewicz and Ajdukiewicz instead.
6.1 Introductory Remarks
A theory of deﬁnitions which places the eliminability and conservativeness
requirements on deﬁnitions is usually (following Belnap 1993) called the standard
theory. In this chapter1 we look at a persistent myth which credits this theory to
Le´sniewski.2 After a brief survey of its origins, we show that the myth is highly
dubious:
• No place in Le´sniewski’s published or unpublished work is known where the
standard conditions are discussed.
• Le´sniewski’s own logical theories allow for creative deﬁnitions.
• Le´sniewski’s celebrated ‘rules of deﬁnition’ lay merely syntactical restrictions on
the form of deﬁnitions: they do not provide deﬁnitions with such meta-theoretical
requirements as eliminability or conservativeness.
1 This chapter is based on a paper (Urbaniak and Hämäri 2012), which contains more details and a
collection of translations of main source texts.
2 This common belief has lingered at least since the publication of Suppes (1957) (but only
Nemesszeghy and Nemesszeghy (1977) try to bring up some evidence to corroborate it).

Le´sniewski and Deﬁnitions
On the positive side, we point out that among the Polish logicians, in the 1920s and
1930s, a study of these meta-theoretical conditions is more readily found in the works
of J. Łukasiewicz and K. Ajdukiewicz.
This issue bears on how we are to estimate Le´sniewski’s impact on Tarski. Betti
(2008a) argues that the forerunner of Tarski’s semantical investigations was not
Le´sniewski, but rather Ajdukiewicz. Although Betti does not discuss the history of the
desiderata put on deﬁnitions, Hodges (2008) asks how Le´sniewski’s theories affected
Tarski’s views on deﬁnitions. He concludes that ‘[i]t’s impossible to measure how
far Le´sniewski’s other views3 on deﬁnitions inﬂuenced Tarski without establishing
what those other views were, and this is difﬁcult’ (103).
Below (in Sects.6.6 and 6.7) we try to shed more light on what ‘those other
views were’. Even though many of these issues are well known among Le´sniewski
scholars,4 the persistence of the above-mentioned folklore indicates that the wider
audience might not be as familiar with them. This unfamiliarity is not completely sur-
prising, given Le´sniewski’s unapproachable style (see Sect.6.4) and, until recently,
the lack of comprehensive and tangible secondary sources on his theory of deﬁni-
tions.5 Two separate issues are at play here: on one hand, we may ask who endorsed
the theory; on the other, who analyzed the conditions. We argue (in Sect.6.7) that
Le´sniewski’s ‘rules of deﬁnitions’ ensured eliminability but allowed for creativity
without him commenting on why he proceeded this way. Instead, we establish (in
Sect.6.8) that Łukasiewicz employed the conservativeness requirement in an argu-
ment against Le´sniewski, and that Ajdukiewicz managed to develop a rather elab-
orate account of those requirements that forms the grounds of the standard theory.
Finally, we dismantle the evidence which Nemesszeghy and Nemesszeghy (1977)
use to argue that the theory is Le´sniewski’s. We hope that our treatment here paints an
accessible picture of Le´sniewski’s position on deﬁnitions for those not yet acquainted
with it.6
3 Hodges argues that there is a link between Le´sniewski’s requirement of ‘irresistible intuitive
validity’ and Tarski’s ‘wymóg trafno´sci’ (i.e. the material adequacy requirement) [102–103, 114].
4 See for instance (Rickey 1975a; Simons 2008b).
5 For instance, although Luschei (1962, 36) testiﬁes that ‘Le´sniewski’s rules for deﬁnition… are
among his most important scientiﬁc contributions, and need to be rescued from comparative obliv-
ion’, and further explains that he knows of ‘no other rules comparable in adequacy and rigor of
formalization to Le´sniewski’s directives of deﬁnition, more comprehensive and exact even than
Frege’s’ [ibidem], he leaves the nature of those rules rather unexplained. He brings them up only in
his rendering of Terminological Explanations, especially in T.E. XLIV. This terminological expla-
nation starts with ‘A is legitimate as propositive deﬁnition immediately after thesis B of this system
if and only if the following eighteen conditions are fulﬁlled…’ and continues with a rather literal
representation of what Le´sniewski himself said about the conditions.
6 Since we are here concerned only with the Poles of Lvov-Warsaw school, we can only hint at the
discussions of e.g. Kant’s, Mill’s, Frege’s, Peano’s, and Russell’s roles in the early developments of
the standard account. (We have a few remarks in Sects.6.3 and 6.5, though.) Decent introductions
to theories of deﬁnitions are Gupta (2009) and Abelson (1967) and the monographs (Dubislav
1981; Robinson 1954). Most original texts prior to Frege are in Sager (2000) (although it lacks the
relevant passages from Port-Royal Logic. Beck (1956) seems still the authority on Kant’s treatment
of deﬁnitions. Shieh (2008) has extensive Frege references (both primary and secondary) as well

6.2 Basic Notions
141
6.2 Basic Notions
The standard theory, in contrast to theories about teachers’, lawyers’, legislators’,
or lexicographers’ deﬁnitions, is concerned with deﬁnitions in the logicians’ sense:
a deﬁnition is a formula (or a set of such) which, relative to a formal theory and
a language, ﬁxes the meaning of new symbols occurring in it. (We can ignore the
otherwise important distinction between explicit and implicit deﬁnitions here. Also,
we are not considering meta-theoretical abbreviations, but object level “acronymic”
deﬁnitions which introduce new symbols into the object language).
As Belnap (1993, 119) reasons, ‘a deﬁnition of a word should explain all the
meaning that [the] word has, and… it should do only this and nothing more.’ He
suggests that a natural connection with these intuitive desiderata might be the reason
why the standard theory placed eliminability and conservativeness as the criteria7
of acceptable deﬁnitions. He also argues that the criterion of eliminability ascertains
that the intuition about ‘all the meaning’ is satisﬁed while the criterion of conserva-
tiveness, i.e. non-creativity, ensures the satisfaction of the ‘only’ part.
Let us look into some technical details. In deductive terms eliminability is deﬁned
as follows. Let T be a theory, L its language and  a set of formulas in an extended
language L′ ⊇L. Then, symbols in L′ \ L are eliminable (i.e. “ is eliminable”) in
T ∪ with respect to L if and only if for any formula φ in language L′ there exists
a formula ψ in L such that T ∪ ⊢φ ≡ψ. In other words, every expression in the
extended language has to be “translatable” into the old language. Conservativeness,
on the other hand, is deﬁned as follows. Let T , , L and L′ be as above.  is
conservative over T if and only if for all formulas φ in the language L, if T ∪
 ⊢φ then T ⊢φ. This means that no new claim that can be formulated in the
original language becomes provable once the deﬁnition is introduced. As we can
see, according to the standard view a set of formulas  is a deﬁnition only with
respect to some theory and some language; there are no general syntactical criteria
of deﬁnitions here.
(Footnote 6 continued)
as a good introduction to his theory of deﬁnitions. On Peano’s groups’ treatment of deﬁnitions and
deﬁnability in mathematics there appears to be only a few sources in English. Grattan-Guinness
(2000) is a notable exception. His book is a valuable source on the other players as well, just
search his index for ‘deﬁnition’. Anyone interested in the Peanists should look at Padoa (1900),
which is one of the most important texts in early model theory and the problem of deﬁnability.
Before E. Beth’s breakthrough in the 1950s, Tarski was one of the few working on Padoa’s method,
see Tarski (1934) and Hodges (2008). Kennedy (1973) sketches the impact Peano’s theory of
deﬁnition had on young Russell. Dubislav’s role in the development of the standard theory might
turn out to be important. This German positivist and logician published two editions of his book
Die Deﬁnition (Dubislav 1981) in the late 1920s and the third edition in 1931. He discusses creative
(schöpferischen) deﬁnitions in considerable detail. We know that at least Koj (1987) talks about
Dubislav’s impact on Ajdukiewicz. Grattan-Guinness (2000, 486, 519–520) provides a description
of Dubislav’s work in general. For anyone interested, most present-day issues are examined in the
collection (Fetzer et al. 1991).
7 We do not use the word ‘criterion’ in a technical “Wittgensteinian” sense, but as a synonym of
‘condition’ and ‘requirement’.

Le´sniewski and Deﬁnitions
To avoid a problem arising from the possibility of two separately conservative (or
eliminable) but jointly creative (non-eliminable) deﬁnitions, the deﬁnitions have to
be introduced in stages. Each subsequent stage has to be eliminable and conservative
over the previous ones. We cannot go into more details of the standard theory. For
the particularities see Suppes (1957, Chap.8), Mates (1972, 197–203) and especially
Belnap (1993).8
As it turns out, eliminability (even supposing consistency) is not a sufﬁcient crite-
rion for a successful deﬁnition. Deﬁnitional extensions might differ on a fundamental
level from the original theory, e.g. they might lack a model with cardinality in the
spectrum of the original theory.
Without the criterion of conservativeness we would also run the risk of Prior’s
(1960) skepticism or ‘tonktitis’, as Belnap (1962) called it. Prior argues that the rules
of deduction cannot function as deﬁnitions that explain all the meanings of the logical
constants: there are inconsistent sets of rules (that is, rules which lead to triviality).
But there is more here than meets the eye. Belnap replies that there is a difference
between rules that can function as deﬁnitions and rules that cannot: the rules that
deﬁne meaning are conservative over the underlying logic. Therefore, the criterion
of conservativeness is important to the proof-theoretic meaning theory as well (see
also Hacking 1979).
As we will explain in Sect.6.6, Le´sniewski’s deﬁnitions (e.g. in his theory called
Ontology) satisfy the eliminability but not, in general, the conservativeness require-
ment (yet we have pretty good reasons to think the system is consistent (Słupecki
1955)). Why, then, was the standard theory ascribed to him?
6.3 On the Origins of the Folklore
As far as we can tell, no publication by Le´sniewski is the origin of the folklore, and
most book passages and articles on deﬁnitions between the 1930s and the 1960s
contain nothing about Le´sniewski. For instance, even in (Łukasiewicz 1963, 31–33)
where Le´sniewski’s views on deﬁnitions are implicitly criticized, none of these views
are explicitly attributed to him. (We will come back to Łukasiewicz’s lecture notes,
originally presented in 1928–1929, in Sect.6.8.)
AreferencetoLe´sniewski’sposition,however,canbefoundatleastinŁukasiewicz
(1928b), Tarski (1941), Mostowski (1948), Kelley (1955), Church (1956), Suppes
(1957) and Ajdukiewicz (1936) (in an introduction written in 1960). We will show
in Sect.6.8 that Lukasiewicz and Ajdukiewicz have not contributed to the folklore.
Let us look a bit closer at the other sources.9
8 Došen and Schroeder-Heister (1985) discuss slightly different notions (which are used in Belnap
(1962): conservativeness and uniqueness. They show that this pair of conditions has interesting
properties (e.g. they are dual to each other in certain contexts).
9 For the sources on Le´sniewski’s views, see also (Hodges 2008, 103–5).

6.3 On the Origins of the Folklore
143
In Tarski’s Introduction to Logic Tarski (1941) we ﬁnd that:
…the present day methodology endeavors to replace subjective scrutiny of deﬁnitions… by
criteria of an objective nature, in such a way that the decision regarding the correctness of
given deﬁnitions… would depend exclusively upon their structure, that is, upon their exterior
form. For this purpose, special rules of deﬁnition… are introduced. [These rules] tell us what
form the sentences should have which are used as deﬁnitions… each deﬁnition has to be
constructed in accordance with the rules of deﬁnition… [In footnote:] one of [Le´sniewski’s]
achievements is an exact and exhaustive formulation of the rules of deﬁnition. (Tarski 1941,
123, n. 4)10
Although Tarski does not explicate what Le´sniewski’s ‘rules of deﬁnition’ are,
we agree with Hodges (2008) that it is clear from the context that Tarski means some
syntactical criteria for good deﬁnitions. There is no mention of meta-theoretical
requirements in the passage. As we will see later, Tarski’s remark is adequate. Still,
Tarski cites no works and states no explicit rules by Le´sniewski and this might have
caused some confusion.
Church when writing about the object language deﬁnitions in Introduction to
Mathematical Logic Church (1956) states that he…
…agrees with Le´sniewski that, if such deﬁnitions are allowed [in the object language], it
must be on the basis of rules of deﬁnition, included as a part of the primitive basis of the
language and as precisely formulated as we have required in the case of the formation and
transformation rules… Unfortunately, authors who use deﬁnitions in this sense have not
always stated rules of deﬁnition with sufﬁcient care… On the other hand, once the rules of
deﬁnition have been precisely formulated, they become at least theoretically superﬂuous,
because it would always be possible to oversee in advance everything that could be introduced
by deﬁnition, and to provide for it instead by primitive notations included in the primitive
basis of the language… Because of the theoretical dispensability of deﬁnitions in [this]
sense… we prefer not to use them… (Church 1956, 76, n. 168).
Here it is clear that the mentioned rules of deﬁnition are taken to be syntactical and
that object language deﬁnitions should at least be eliminable. Although it appears that
Church is silent about creativity, it is nonetheless plausible that the deﬁnitions which
he would allow are non-creative, for he states that the correct rules for deﬁnitional
introduction of symbols would make the system interchangeable with another one
that lacks them. Church could well have adhered to the standard theory.
What, then, is Church attributing to Le´sniewski? An interpretation which reads
Le´sniewski as embracing the ‘superﬂuity’ of object language deﬁnitions is of little
credibility. Thus we are left with another more plausible but rather vague interpre-
tation on which Le´sniewski wanted deﬁnitions to be governed by precise rules. On
10 The emphases are changed. There are some small points pertinent to the history of this passage
in Tarski’s Introduction. The German edition (Tarski 1937), which otherwise seems to agree with
the translation, does not credit Le´sniewski with the formulation of the rules of deﬁnition. Hodges
(2008) notes that the attribution of ‘an exact and exhaustive formulation of the rules of deﬁnition’
appeared in the English edition of 1941. He suggest that the change might be ‘a mark of respect for
a teacher who had died just 2 years earlier.’ [103]. Also, in the fourth edition of 1994 ‘an exact’ is
replaced by slightly less emphatic ‘a precise’. It is not clear whether it was Tarski’s decision, Jan
Tarski’s improvement of his father’s style, or John Corcoran’s choice of a more appropriate word.

Le´sniewski and Deﬁnitions
this reading Church (1956) (in a way, just like Tarski) contributes to the folklore not
by what he says, but rather by what he leaves unexplained.
The same is true about Mostowski. The most explicit remark about Le´sniewski
to be found there is:
The need of a precise formulation of the rule of deﬁnitions has been strongly emphasized
by Le´sniewski. He gave a precise formulation of this rule with respect to the systems he
constructed. (Mostowski 1948, 251)
Kelley (1955) and Suppes (1957), on the other hand, subscribe to the folklore.
Kelley states in an appendix that he implicitly posits ‘an axiom scheme for deﬁnition’
and that…
…the axiom scheme of deﬁnition is in the fortunate position of being justiﬁable in the sense
that, if the deﬁnitions conform with the prescribed rules, then no new contradictions and no
real enrichment of the theory results. These results are due to S. Le´sniewski. (Kelley 1955,
251, n.)
Here Kelley is slightly vague: what would he count as a ‘real enrichment’? If, as
is natural to assume, he means inferential creativity, then he might be the ﬁrst to
state the folklore. (He is partly right since Le´sniewski’s rules would ascertain the
consistency of the introduced deﬁnitions within a consistent theory, even though the
relative consistency proof is not due to Le´sniewski.) Kelly presents no source for his
claim.
Suppes (1957) seems far more explicit than Kelley. He states that:
it is not intended that a deﬁnition shall strengthen the theory in any substantive way. The
point of introducing a new symbol is to facilitate… investigation… but not to add to… [the]
structure [of a theory]. Two criteria which make more speciﬁc these intuitive ideas about
the character of deﬁnitions are that (i) a deﬁned symbol should always be eliminable from
any formula… and (ii) a new deﬁnition does not permit the proof of relationships among
the old symbols which were previously unprovable; that is, it does not function as a creative
axiom. [In a footnote:] These two criteria were ﬁrst formulated by the Polish logician S.
Le´sniewski… he was also the ﬁrst person to give rules of deﬁnition satisfying the criteria.
(153)
As we can see, Suppes states the standard theory; and there is no doubt about what
he credits to Le´sniewski. Suppes claims that Le´sniewski (a) had ‘formulated’ the
conditions and (b) had laid these requirement on some ‘rules of deﬁnitions’.
The former claim is dubious, bearing in mind Frege’s remarks on non-creativity
and eliminability of deﬁnitions in 1914:
Now when a simple sign is thus introduced to replace a group of signs, such a stipulation
is a deﬁnition. The simple sign thereby acquires a sense which is the same as that of the
group of signs. Deﬁnitions are not absolutely essential to a system. We could make do with
the original group of signs. The introduction of a simple sign adds nothing to the content; it
only makes for ease and simplicity of expression.
…
A sign has a meaning once one has been bestowed upon it by deﬁnition, and the deﬁnition
goes over into a sentence asserting an identity. Of course the sentence is really only a
tautology and does not add to our knowledge. It contains a truth which is so self-evident

6.3 On the Origins of the Folklore
145
that it appears devoid of content, and yet in setting up a system it is apparently used as a
premise. I say apparently, for what is thus presented in the form of conclusion makes no
addition to our knowledge; all it does in fact is to effect an alteration of expression, and
we might dispense with this if the resultant simpliﬁcation of expression did not strike us
as desirable. In fact it is not possible to prove something new from a deﬁnition alone that
would be unprovable without it. When something that looks like a deﬁnition really makes it
possible to prove something which could not be proved before, then it is no mere deﬁnition
but must conceal something which would have either to be proved as a theorem or accepted
as an axiom. (Frege 1914, 208)
Even earlier (he has remarks about non-creativity already in Begriffschift (1879,
55), see also Shieh 2008, 994), not to mention the fact that the basic ideas behind
eliminabilityas well as non-creativitywere, arguably, knownat least byBlaisePascal.
The case of eliminability is clear, since the possibility of substituting mentally the
deﬁned term with the deﬁniens in all contexts is mentioned many times in De L’esprit
Géométrique (1814b, e.g. 127). But the case of non-creativity needs an argument.
Pascal not only demands that the sentences containing the deﬁned word must be
translatable to ones not containing it. He also demands that all proofs containing the
deﬁned word must be translatable into proofs not containing the word [otherwise
proofs would not be persuasive (Pascal 1814a, 161)]. Therefore, one might argue
(just like in the case of Church) that Pascal, if asked, would have said that deﬁnitions
are non-creative. But the cases are not identical, and we have here an open question:
would Pascal allow for a deﬁnition to act as an axiom with existential import?11 If the
answer to this query is positive, then Pascal would have accepted creative deﬁnitions
nonetheless.12 But, without doubt, non-creativity was known to Mill (1869, 100)
who lampooned the idea of using deﬁnitions as premises in any other context than
when we are dealing with words.
The failure of claim (b) is slightly less obvious, since, as we will see in
Sect.6.4, Le´sniewski’s idiosyncratic style is difﬁcult to follow. However, given that
Le´sniewski’s logical systems abide by his rules of deﬁnitions and yet deﬁnitions in
those systems are creative (see Sect.6.6), (b) also turns out to be rather implausible.
It is remarkable that both Hodges (2008, 104) and Rickey (1975b) review the points
(a) and (b) of the folklore rather similarly. We discuss their critiques in Sect.6.5.
Further, in Suppes (1957) there is no citation supporting claims (a) and (b)
(According to Hodges (2008, 105), Suppes could not name the reference when
Hodges enquired about it in 1996 and later.). As far as we know, and contrary to
some claims (see Sect.6.5), no one has found any discussion of the conditions in
Le´sniewski’s works. It is probable that none of the texts used by Suppes13 attributed
11 e.g. Hobbes seems to have held such a position, see (Abelson 1967, 318). Think of a deﬁnition
of number zero: zero is the number which has no predecessor. Now, one strategy to eliminate ‘zero’
would be would be to apply existential generalization: there is a number which has no predecessor.
Such an eliminative deﬁnition of zero would be creative if used as a premiss.
12 Compare (Abelson 1967, 319).
13 Tarski (1941) is among Suppes’s references, whereas Kelley (1955) and Church (1956) are not.

Le´sniewski and Deﬁnitions
the standard theory to Le´sniewski. Most other authors cite either Suppes or Belnap
(1993), whose source is also Suppes.14
In general, it seems that already before the mid-1950s writers of introductory
books wrote about Le´sniewski and his so-called rules of deﬁnition. Every time this
happened, the rules were rather mentioned than explicitly described. This tendency
has continued: Le´sniewski’s rules for deﬁnition receive no detailed discussion even
in Wole´nski’s classic book Wole´nski (1985) whose English translation serves the role
of the standard reference when it comes to the Polish school. This unwillingness to
explicate turns out to be nothing surprising given Le´sniewski’s “Byzantine” writing
style.
6.4 On Le´sniewski’s Idiosyncrasies
One of the reasons why the actual nature of Le´sniewski’s rules is hardly known is their
rather convoluted form. Therefore, the reader might ﬁnd a quick tour of his approach
useful. Once we brieﬂy survey these issues, we move on to the later development of
the folklore. Then, we examine the reasons why Le´sniewski’s systems need creative
deﬁnitions and what his rules for deﬁnitions actually state.
In his papers Le´sniewski uses at length a truly idiosyncratic terminology to deﬁne
the rules of inference and the rules of deﬁnitions for his systems by means of what
he calls terminological explanations (T.E.). Chronologically, the ﬁrst paper where
he employs terminological explanations to talk about deﬁnitions is from (1929a) and
his (1931b) is the second one.15 In the former he presents rules for his system of Pro-
tothetic and in the latter he gives rules for a simpler system of classical propositional
logic (here he employs Łukasiewicz’s axiomatization).
Few would call Le´sniewski’s style user-friendly. For instance, the ﬁrst termino-
logical explanation in Le´sniewski (1931b), probably the most straightforward one,
elaborates on the composition of an expression A from a “collection” a of symbols.
The lower-case variables behave like the name variables, which will be described in
detail in Sect.6.6, and capitalized variables stand for singular terms. (Although it is
quite natural to interpret Le´sniewski’s name variables set theoretically, as collections,
it is not in accord with his original ideas, hence the scare quotes. Perhaps, a slightly
14 “I learned most of the theory ﬁrst from Suppes (1957), who credits Le´sniewski …” (Belnap 1993,
117). Here he refers to the same quotation in Suppes above.
15 PublicationdatesarenotperfectlyrepresentativeofwhenLe´sniewskicameupwithvariousthings,
for he often tended to keep his papers in the drawer for a while; so it seems that Mereology dates
back to 1916, Ontology dates back to around 1920 (see e.g. Le´sniewski 1931a, 367), and Protothetic
dates back at least to 1923; it is not clear whether the fact that the systems were constructed in those
years means that full-blown ready-to-print descriptions of those systems are the same age (for more
details, see Urbaniak (2008b, 71–74, 105–107, 140–142).

6.4 On Le´sniewski’s Idiosyncrasies
147
more plausible reading takes them to be plural variables, but we do not need to get
into these details here.)16 The original formulation of T.E. I goes as follows:
I say of object A that it is (the) complex of (the) a if and only if the following conditions are
fulﬁlled:
(1) A is an expression;
(2) if any object is a word that belongs to A, then it belongs to a certain a;
(3) if any object B is a, and object C is a, and some words that belongs to B belongs to C,
then B is the same object as C;
(4) if any object is a, then it is an expression that belongs to A. (Le´sniewski 1931b, 631).
The underlying intuition is that for A to be composed of expressions a, (1) A
has to be an expression (2) composed of words which occur in an expression which
is a only, where (3) expressions a have no words in common, and (4) contain no
expression that does not occur in A.17
This is only the ﬁrst terminological explanation in Le´sniewski (1931b) and they
get more complicated; elsewhere (1929a) he is even less reader-friendly: he presents
his terminological explanations in his full-ﬂedged, idiosyncratic, formalized meta-
language with little explanation in natural language.18 For example, the tenth termi-
nological explanation in (1929a) looks like this:
∀A [A ε qnr1 ≡
∃B (B ε qnt f ∧B ε ingr(A) ∧1ingr(A) ε ingr(B)) ∧
∧∃B (B ε sbqnt f ∧B ε ingr(A) ∧Uingr(A) ε ingr(B)) ∧
∧∀B, C (B ε qnt f ∧Bingr(A) ∧C ε sbqnt f ∧C ε ingr(A) ∧
∧1ingr(A) ε ingr(B) ∧Uingr(A) ε ingr(C) →
→A ε Compl(B ∪C))]
All of this only states the necessary and sufﬁcient conditions for an expression A to
be a quantiﬁed formula (i.e. that (1) there is a quantiﬁer, which contains the bound
variables, which occurs in A, and whose ﬁrst word is the ﬁrst word of A; (2) there
is a range of a quantiﬁer which occurs in A such that the last word occurring in A
occurs in the range of this quantiﬁer; and (3) for any two expressions B and C such
that B is a quantiﬁer occurring in A and C is a range of a quantiﬁer and occurs in A,
if the ﬁrst word in A occurs in B and the last word of A occurs in C, A is the result
of the composition of B and C).
Le´sniewski uses this kind of strategy at length to deﬁne the systems under inves-
tigation. In (1931b) he presents an axiom for the classical propositional calculus,
16 For more details pertaining to the philosophical issues related to Le´sniewski’s variables and
quantiﬁers see (Urbaniak 2008b, Chap.7).
17 For a slightly elaborate explanation of what Le´sniewski means by ‘words’, he sends the reader
to his 1929a paper.
18 Le´sniewski, however, does not think of it as a formal system sensu stricto.

148

Le´sniewski and Deﬁnitions
formulates the rules of inference (detachment and substitution), and syntactically
deﬁnes the shape of correct deﬁnitions.
For instance, Ajdukiewicz (1928, 51), who in general agrees that Le´sniewski’s
system ‘is the only system with precisely formulated rules for deﬁnitions’, when
comparing Le´sniewski’s rules for deﬁnitions with those of Frege emphasized that
the main difference between their views is that Le´sniewski explicitly required that the
deﬁniens should not contain quantiﬁers and that it should not contain different occur-
rences of one and the same variable. Nothing beyond that, even if the complicated
form of the description may make its content seem more elaborate.
In general, the preceding examples should sufﬁce as an illustration of the challenge
that detailed understanding of Le´sniewski’s rules poses, and as an explanation of the
relative unpopularity of his work. An uncharitably minded reader could say that no
deep intrinsic logical complexity is involved in Le´sniewski’s explications; after all,
if all the formulation does is provide a description of what the axiom is and what
rules of inference are, this can be done in a more accessible manner; and she might
conclude that Le´sniewski’s meticulous emphasis on precision and full formalization
is an overkill which, mixed with the unfamiliarity of his language, makes the effort
of reading his work seem too strenuous.
This attitude is understandable. Most logicians can lead their lives tackling more
intrinsically interesting logical problems without requiring this level of precision.
Considering the fact that Le´sniewski was publishing in the late 1920s and early
1930s, when deeper logical problems surfaced, it is no wonder his work received
little attention (For example, Jordan (1945, 44), who knew Le´sniewski’s works well,
says that reading Le´sniewski’s account of deﬁnition is a ‘somewhat excruciating
experience’ for anyone ‘anxious to spare themselves the valuable thought’.). But
this fact does not imply that Le´sniewski’s approach is worthless. For example, the
development of proof theory in the 1960s and 1970s required almost the same level
of syntactical precision that Le´sniewski embraced. Some possible reasons why he
adopted such a style and stern standards are discussed in Simons (2008b).
On the other end of the spectrum, some people when faced with Le´sniewski’s
complicated metalanguage get an impression of hidden wisdom and a feeling that
more is being said than what they can grasp. They too are somewhat responsible for
the long life of the myth.
6.5 Later Developments in the Folklore
Probably the most known recent paper about the standard account is Belnap (1993),
where Belnap acknowledges the folklore. Here, however, we can see some caution:
he is painfully aware of the lack of an original source. As we discussed earlier, his
only reference is to Suppes’s Introduction to Logic. He writes that ‘[t]he standard
theory of deﬁnitions seems to be due to Le´sniewski, who modeled his “directives” on
the work of Frege, but I cannot tell you where to ﬁnd a history of its development.’
Belnap continues with a guess at which texts might be relevant. He supposes that

6.5 Later Developments in the Folklore
149
the theory might be in Le´sniewski (1931b), or at least somewhere in Le´sniewski’s
Collected works; as far as we know, it is in neither.
Because of Belnap’s reservations we see caution, for example, in Horty (2007).
When Horty discusses how the fruitfulness of deﬁnitions relates to the requirements
of conservativeness and eliminability in Frege’s works,19 he notes that the ‘explicit
formulation’ of the criteria ‘is generally credited to Le´sniewski’ and that he knows ‘of
no complete history of the modern theory of deﬁnition, but some historical remarks
can be found in Belnap (1993)…’ [34, n. 4].
On the other hand, Gupta (2009) implies that the standard account might be
by Ajdukiewicz. He states that one of the present authors, R. Urbaniak, holds this
stance. However, at the time, Urbaniak had only remarked on two issues concerning
this debate. First, the conditions were to the best of his knowledge not formulated
by Le´sniewski. Second, as long as the Polish logicians are concerned, Ajdukiewicz
studied the conditions. Unlike Gupta, we do not claim unqualiﬁed Polish origin of
the standard theory; and, as our recent ﬁndings suggest, the priority even among the
Poles might belong to another logician, Jan Łukasiewicz.
The most exciting period in the development of the folklore is the 1970s. During
that time, a discussion over the admissibility of the deﬁnition of implication to be
found in Principia Mathematica raised also a debate over the justiﬁcation of the
ascription of the standard requirements to Le´sniewski. This debate appears to be
unknown to the later authors on the history of deﬁnitions.
For example, neither Belnap (1993), nor Gupta (2009), nor Hodges (2008) refer
to these papers from the 1970s. In Nemesszeghy and Nemesszeghy (1971), which
started the discussion about implication in PM (Nemesszeghys claim that, unexpect-
edly, the PM deﬁnition of implication is creative) we ﬁnd an indubitable afﬁrmation
of the folklore.20
Dudman (1973), in a reply, points out that the attribution is mistaken because
of the priority of Frege’s writings. Rickey (1975b), on the other hand, brings forth
strong arguments against the folklore. Rickey criticizes especially Nemesszeghy
and Nemesszeghy (1971), but notes that the essentially same argument can be put
forward against Kelley (1955), and Suppes (1957). On all his points pertaining to
Le´sniewski, Rickey does not just rely on his own expertise, but he expresses gratitude
to B. Soboci´nski who ‘[veriﬁed] all of the comments… about Le´sniewski’. This is
interesting because Soboci´nski (who was a student of Le´sniewski and, after his
teacher’s untimely death, one of the main contributors in the study of Le´sniewski’s
systems alongside with Lejewski) took care of Le´sniewski’s Nachlass from 1939
until it was lost around 1944 (See Simons 2008b).
19 Here Horty claims that although Frege subscribed to the standard requirements, he gave no
logical analysis of these conditions.
20 Even though Nemesszeghy and Nemesszeghy do not credit Suppes, they seem to be following
him. Here is the quotation from Nemesszeghy and Nemesszeghy (1971) for comparison with the
above citation from Suppes (1957): “The idea that deﬁnitions should not strengthen the theory in
any signiﬁcant way ﬁnds expression in the following two criteria ﬁrst formulated by the Polish
logician S. Le´sniewski: (1) a deﬁned symbol should be always eliminable, (2) a deﬁnition should
not permit the proof of previously unprovable relationships among the old symbols.”

150

Le´sniewski and Deﬁnitions
The negative part of Rickey’s argument can be reconstructed as follows: he points
at (a) the priority of Galileo Galilei on the notion of eliminability of deﬁnitions21 and
at (b) the priority of Pascal and Mill on the notion of non-creativity; he also claims
that (c) there is no manuscript, paper or book in Le´sniewski’s oeuvre where these
requirements are mentioned as the criteria; and that (d) in his theories Le´sniewski
utilized creative deﬁnitions freely.
Hodges (2008, 104) attacks the folklore, as expressed in Suppes (1957), by inde-
pendently formulating an argument similar to Rickey’s reasoning. Hodges comments
in a short passage on (a) Pascal’s and Porphyry’s prior discussion of eliminability,
on (b) the priority of Frege regarding non-creativity, on (c) the absence of textual
evidence, and on (d) the fact that Le´sniewski endorsed creative deﬁnitions. Hodges
also claims that ‘Le´sniewski probably had no general theory of deﬁnitions’, i.e. that
Le´sniewski treated deﬁnitions in a piecemeal manner, in one deductive system at a
time. Nothing in our ﬁndings contradicts this statement.
Rickey in addition lays out a summary of Le´sniewski’s positive achievements
pertaining to deﬁnitions22: (1) Le´sniewski showed that deﬁnitions can be used on the
object language level, and that the symbol ‘=d f ’ is thus superﬂuous; and (2) ‘[s]ince
deﬁnitions are in the object language Le´sniewski realized—and this is a valuable
contribution—that it is necessary to have rules for introducing deﬁnitions.’ [176].
Rickey notes that the rules Le´sniewski placed on deﬁnitions in Le´sniewski (1931b)
ascertained eliminability and consistency.
He concludes that when Le´sniewski developed his rules ‘[c]reative deﬁnitions
were neither deﬁned nor discussed…. However, some of the deﬁnitions introducible
according to that rule are creative (relative to the particular axiom system chosen)’.
(Rickey 1975b, 176). Notwithstanding the clarity of his expression here, Rickey’s
critique seems to have been mostly unnoticed or forgotten: as far as we know, the
only ones who reacted to this criticism were Nemesszeghy and Nemesszeghy (1977).
And they argued against it.
Nemesszeghy and Nemesszeghy (1977) presented the basis of their argument
already in an earlier reply to Dudman.23 In their Nemesszeghy and Nemesszeghy
(1973) they write that in the previous paper they ‘did not attribute to Le´sniewski the
view that all deﬁnitions should satisfy the criteria’.24 They admit that ‘Le´sniewski
used deﬁnitions which satisﬁed [eliminability] but not [non-creativity]’. On the con-
trary, they continue to point out that they only meant ‘that the idea that deﬁni-
tions should not strengthen the theory in any signiﬁcant way ﬁnds expression in
those two criteria of Le´sniewski’. In other words, the argument of Nemesszeghy and
Nemesszeghy implies the exegetical difference that we mentioned in the introduction,
21 Rickey cites Galilei (2001, 28) where ‘mathematical deﬁnitions’ are described as ‘abbreviations’.
22 He restates these contributions in Rickey (1975a). We treat these issues in Sect.6.7.
23 It appears unlikely that Rickey had read Nemesszeghy and Nemesszeghy (1973) before writing
Rickey (1975b).
24 They are correct in this, though the opposite reading is natural, too: see n. 20 above.

6.5 Later Developments in the Folklore
151
between following the requirements and studying them; and they credit Le´sniewski
with the latter.25
It is just this difference that Nemesszeghy and Nemesszeghy (1977, 111–112)
accuse Rickey of “fusing and confusing” and they reiterate that they ‘did think,
and still think, that one can truly hold’ that the ‘[c]onditions… can be attributed to
Le´sniewski.’ Nemesszeghy and Nemesszeghy (1977) base this conviction on the fact
that Le´sniewski ‘was the ﬁrst, at least in modern times, to discuss and use deﬁnitions
that play a creative role’ which, according to them, would not have been possible
without good knowledge of the eliminability and non-creativity properties as a tool
of measure: ‘he had a clear idea of the distinction between “creative role” and a
“mere abbreviative role” of a deﬁnition, which ﬁnds expression in [the] conditions’.
Here [unlike in Nemesszeghy and Nemesszeghy (1971) or (1973)] they provide a
citation to justify their claim—page 50 in Le´sniewski (1929a) (that is, p. 459 in the
English translation).26 First of all, contrary to what is claimed, the passage referred
to does not support the claim (as we argue in extenso in Urbaniak and Hämäri 2012).
Secondly, as we argue in Sect.6.7, the only meta-theoretical principles that
Le´sniewski mentions as guiding his position on deﬁnitions were consistency and
the avoidance of meta-linguistic treatment of deﬁnitions; therefore it seems that he
was interested in the correct syntactic form of deﬁnitions only. Finally, there is evi-
dence, which we discuss in Sect.6.8, that even though it was Le´sniewski’s work on
deﬁnitions which prompted the study of the standard requirements in Poland it was
Łukasiewicz who noticed the importance of the creativity of deﬁnitions, and that (as
far as we know) it was Ajdukiewicz who ﬁrst studied the conditions systematically
(at least in Poland).
We think that the Nemesszeghys attribution of the standard requirements to
Le´sniewski, even only as a measure on deﬁnitions, is an overstatement. His role
in the development of theory of deﬁnitions is important, but to claim on his behalf
the invention of the standard conditions just because he may have been aware of them
is to stretch the facts. Besides, Frege has technically at least as good a claim for them
as Le´sniewski, and Frege has priority. We know that Le´sniewski was well aware of
Frege’s published writings because they were well known among the Poles during
the early decades of twentieth century. According to Wole´nski (2004), Frege’s ideas
were frequently discussed by Łukasiewicz and Le´sniewski. Wole´nski even remarks
that ‘[i]n fact, Le´sniewski’s… work on deﬁnitions… is a continuation and extension
of Frege’s work’ [45]. On Wole´nski’s view, the main difference between Frege and
Le´sniewski is that while the former required non-creativity, the latter allowed cre-
ative deﬁnitions within his systems and thus, to avoid trouble, needed exact rules to
govern them.
25 In comparison with our discussion on Suppes (1957) in Sect.6.3 it seems that Nemesszeghys
deny the claim (b) but afﬁrm claim (a) presented there.
26 The Nemesszeghys give the citation in German and thank Owen Le Blanc for pointing it out to
them. We will give it in English. The same reference (without a page number) is in Jurcic (1987,
198). He states that ‘Le´sniewski (1929a) ﬁrst formulated the rules of deﬁnition and the requirements
of eliminability and noncreativity.’

Le´sniewski and Deﬁnitions
To whom the standard conditions ﬁnally will be attributed remains to be decided
since we still know too little of the overall picture. It is quite possible that as potential
desiderata on good deﬁnitions they formed ideas that were “in the air”, and that they
were, hence, common property.
To sum up, even though the folklore about Le´sniewski and the requirements is
dying away in the tradition following Belnap (1993), one can still run into peo-
ple attributing the restrictions to Le´sniewski. It seems also that the argument in
Nemesszeghy and Nemesszeghy (1977) has not been contested before. This paper is
meant as a coup de grâce to all such allegations. As we have indicated above, we will
proceed through several steps. First we will explain why deﬁnitions in Le´sniewski’s
systems are creative. Then we will look at Le´sniewski’s rules of deﬁnitions, and
explain what they actually said: we will show that eliminability and conservative-
ness as the criteria (or a measure) of deﬁnitions are not to be found there. We will
argue that, at least on Polish grounds, the study of these criteria should be credited
to Łukasiewicz and Ajdukiewicz. Finally, we will reconsider Nemesszeghys’ claim.
6.6 The Creativity of Le´sniewski’s Deﬁnitions
Now we will turn to Le´sniewski’s systems, and explain why some deﬁnitions in these
systems are creative. To start with, deﬁnitions for Le´sniewski are not meta-linguistic
abbreviations; rather, he treats them as axioms (of a speciﬁc kind) formulated in the
language of the system itself. The introduction of these deﬁnitions is to be governed
by what he calls ‘rules of deﬁnitions’.
Since our goal is only to explain why deﬁnitions in Ontology are creative, we can
put many technical details aside and look at a rather simple example of deﬁnitions
of name constants. Recall that the rule of deﬁnition for name constants says that a
new constant γ can be introduced by means of a formula:
∀a [a ε γ ≡a ε a ∧φ(a)]
(6.1)
where φ(a) is a formula in the language of the system not containing any free
variables other than a or other deﬁned constants. (Strictly speaking, Le´sniewski
allowed deﬁned constants to occur in deﬁning conditions. He did this on the condition
that the order in which constants have been introduced is maintained so that the
deﬁnitions involved contain no circularity. We do not need this level of detail.)
The presence of a ε a on the right-hand side might at ﬁrst seem slightly surpri-
sing; the underlying idea here is that since the left-hand side assumes that a “is a
singular term”, the right-hand side has to do the same, and ‘a ε a’ expresses exactly
this statement (because no distinction between singular terms and other terms is built
into the syntax, a ε a has to be explicitly stated).
Thus, for instance, a formula that prima facie looks like a deﬁnition of Russell’s
class:
∀a [a ε λ ≡¬a ε a]
(6.2)

6.6 The Creativity of Le´sniewski’s Deﬁnitions
153
is inadmissible as a deﬁnition; it is not a theorem of Ontology either, and it easily
leads to contradiction since it entails λ ε λ ≡¬λ ε λ. Rather, the correct deﬁnition
would be:
∀a [a ε λ ≡a ε a ∧¬a ε a]
(6.3)
which, since its right-hand side is a contradiction, entails:
¬∃a a ε λ,
(6.4)
which only says that nothing is λ (or that ‘λ’ doesn’t name anything).
A closer examination reveals that (6.3) says that a is λ iff, ﬁrst, a is an object,
and second, a is not a. This avoids the contradiction because what we get when we
substitute λ for a is:
λ ε λ ≡λ ε λ ∧¬λ ε λ
(6.5)
Since the right-hand side of (6.5) is a straightforward contradiction, we can simply
derive the negation of the left-hand side:
¬λ ε λ
(6.6)
This, however, does not allow us to infer that λ ε λ.
By existential generalization, (6.4) entails that there is an empty name:
∃b ¬∃a a ε b.
(6.7)
Thisconsequence,however,essentiallyreliesonthedeﬁnitionofλandisnotprovable
in a system obtained by deleting the rule of deﬁnitions.
To see more clearly why the deﬁnition is creative, the following comparison
would be useful. Consider a system which instead of the rule of deﬁnition contains
what we may call deﬁnitional comprehension: for any φ(a) which satisﬁes the same
conditions as those put on deﬁning conditions occurring in deﬁnitions the following
is an axiom:27
∃b ∀a [a ε b ≡a ε a ∧φ(a)]
(6.8)
(Similar additions are to be made for other types of deﬁnitions.) If we were to
add to this system with deﬁnitional comprehension a deﬁnition (or any number of
deﬁnitions) formulated in accordance with Le´sniewski’s schema (6.1), the obtained
deﬁnitional extension would be non-creative.28
27 Observe that by adding axioms of the form ∃b ∀a (a ε b ≡φ(a)) we would be able to derive the
Russellian contradiction if we take φ(a) to be ¬a ε a.
28 See Stachniak (1981) for a proof of a theorem from which our claim follows.

Le´sniewski and Deﬁnitions
Thus thereasonwhydeﬁnitions arecreativeintheoriginal systemis that Ontology,
as it stands, lacks deﬁnitional comprehension: whenever one wants to prove ∃b φ(b)
one has to deﬁne a γ , prove φ(γ ), and then use existential generalization.29
So in a deﬁnition-free system with comprehension all constant-free theorems of
the version with deﬁnitions but without comprehension are provable. The converse
holds, too.
6.7 What Did Le´sniewski’s Rules for Deﬁnitions Actually Do?
Le´sniewski (1931b) set out to give precise rules for deﬁnitions for Łukasiewicz’s
axiomatization of classical propositional logic.30 Here Le´sniewski uses his so-called
terminological explanations to describe syntactically the axioms and the admissible
rules of inference, including the rules of deﬁnitions (Le´sniewski’s rules of deﬁnitions
for various systems are described in earlier chapters of this book). This syntactical
focus makes his line of pursuit essentially different from Ajdukiewicz’s strategy
(which is discussed in the next section).
Crucial for Le´sniewski’s approach to deﬁnitions is his Terminological Explanation
XI where he states what shape a deﬁnition is supposed to have. This explanation boils
down to the requirement that a deﬁnition should be a formula of the form:
¬[(γ (α1, . . . , αn) →φ(α1, . . . , αn)) →¬(φ(α1, . . . , αn) →γ (α1, . . . , αn))],
which is just a roundabout way of using negation and implication (which are primitive
in the system) to express the equivalence:
γ (α1, . . . , αn) ≡φ(α1, . . . , αn)
where γ is a constant symbol being deﬁned, α1, . . . , αn are all different propositional
variables, φ contains onlyprimitive(or previouslydeﬁned) symbols, andtheformulas
contain only the explicitly mentioned variables.31
To get a clear picture of what is going on here we need only to look further at the
last (twelfth) terminological explanation and the conclusion in Le´sniewski (1931b).
Terminological Explanation XII says ‘of [an] object A that it is a deﬁnition, relative
to C if and only if A is a deﬁnition of some expression, relative to C, by means of
some expression, and with respect to some expression’ [647]. This, when translated
from Le´sniewskese, basically states that a formula is a deﬁnition at a certain stage of
development of a system if there is an expression of which it is a correct deﬁnition
at that stage.
29 Stachniak (1981) gives a Henkin-style completeness proof for a variant of Ontology which
contains deﬁnitional comprehension for all categories of constants.
30 Le´sniewski (1931b) is a summary of the lectures that Le´sniewski gave in Warsaw in 1930–1931.
31 In Le´sniewskianese this does have its bells and whistles and sounds a bit more complicated.

6.7 What Did Le´sniewski’s Rules for Deﬁnitions Actually Do?
155
Le´sniewski concludes the paper with a claim that a formula can be added to the
system only if it is a consequence by substitution of previously proven theses, or it is
a consequence by detachment of previously proven theses, or it is a correctly added
deﬁnition. In general, Le´sniewski’s terminological explanations are meant to deﬁne
the syntactic relation of derivability. They do not employ the notion itself and, a
fortiori, they say nothing about conservativeness (This point holds for his treatment
of deﬁnitions for all systems he considers).
At this point, it should be clear what Le´sniewski set out to do and what he achieved.
Using a rather idiosyncratic semi-formalized metalanguage, without any reference
to eliminability or non-creativity, he provided a meticulous description of what syn-
tactic form deﬁnitions should have. Deﬁnitions that satisfy his rules have consis-
tency and eliminability properties. Yet he presented no proofs to this end: consis-
tency is only mentioned in passing when Le´sniewski says that the reason behind his
rules is to ensure the consistency of the system and eliminability is just an unmen-
tioned side-effect of the rules. Ajdukiewicz, on the other hand, instead of focusing
on the syntactical form of deﬁnitions, tries to work out a more general motivation
for them, suggesting that the syntactic restrictions result from certain more general
meta-theoretical requirements.

Łukasiewicz (1929),32 in a rather short passage about deﬁnitions in propositional
logic (in his logic course materials) remarks that substitution of deﬁned terms should
preserve the truth-value of sentences, and that addition of deﬁnitions should not make
new expressions formulated in the original language provable:
Sharing the view of the authors of Principia Mathematica I hold that deﬁnitions are theoret-
ically superﬂuous. If we have a theory in which deﬁnitions do not appear at all, nothing new
should be obtainable in that theory after we introduce deﬁnitions. (Łukasiewicz 1929, 52)
Alas, he also remarks that these issues do not belong to a general course in logic,
and does not elaborate.
He, however, does not credit himself with the formulation of these criteria. In his
introduction to this script he explicitly lists what he thinks the results he can claim
are. He mentions (i) his bracket-free notation for propositional logic and Aristotle’s
syllogistic, (ii) his axiomatization of propositional logic, (iii) his way of writing down
proofsinthesystemsinquestionandsomeoftheproofs,(iv)hisremarksaboutdeduc-

Le´sniewski and Deﬁnitions
his completeness proof for propositional logic, (vii) his axiomatization of Aristotle’s
syllogistic, and (viii) some historical remarks about Aristotle, Stoics, Frege, Origen
and Sextus. He notes that he could also claim (ix) his consistency proof for proposi-
tional logic and (x) his style of independence proofs, but those were independently
invented by Post and Bernays. Most notably, he does not mention the restrictions
on deﬁnitions, and he explicitly remarks: “Apart from the above-mentioned points,
whatever can be found in the lectures, is not my property.” (Łukasiewicz 1929, vii).
He also observes that he owes a lot to discussions with his colleagues and their
students and that there are many results he simply cannot correctly attribute.
Some new light can be cast on the history of the conditions when we look a few
years earlier at the reports from the meetings of the Polish Philosophical Society
that can be found in the 1928–1929 volume of Ruch Filozoﬁczny (Philosophical
Movement). Łukasiewicz (1928a) describes a talk he gave at a plenary session of
the Society on March 24, 1928, titled The role of deﬁnitions in deductive systems.
There, he opposes to the idea that deﬁnitions should be interpreted as theorems of a
given system and suggests that they rather should be interpreted meta-linguistically
as abbreviations. The reason he presents is that if the former path is chosen, new
theorems formulated in the language devoid of deﬁnitions can become provable.
This, however, is not the whole story.
Only a few weeks before this talk, Łukasiewicz presented a more elaborate lecture
in the Logic Section of the Society, titled “About deﬁnitions in theories of deduc-
tion”.33 Although Łukasiewicz does not say this, it is quite possible that he is attack-
ing the views of Le´sniewski who having criticized the meta-theoretical treatment
of theorems and deﬁnitions in Principia Mathematica34 decided to treat deﬁnitions
intra-theoretically. Łukasiewicz starts off by presenting the opposition between two
ways of interpreting deﬁnitions—as meta-theoretical abbreviations introduced by
means of rules, and as theorems formulated within the system. Then he sketches two
examples of creative deﬁnitions (in a propositional language) formulated using the
latter, intra-theoretical approach (the creativity of one of them has been proven by
Wajsberg, and of the other by Łukasiewicz). Łukasiewicz’s main point is that we
should interpret deﬁnitions meta-theoretically since their creativity, which clearly
can take place if deﬁnitions are interpreted intra-theoretically, is undesirable.
Łukasiewicz mentions then that Professor Le´sniewski participated in the discus-
sion insisting that ‘in [his] Ontology deﬁnitions lead to theses independent of the
axioms; this is not a vice; quite the contrary: if one adds deﬁnitions, creative is exactly
what they should be.’ [178]
A few points seem worth bringing up. First, Łukasiewicz’s method of ﬁnding
independence proofs plays a key role here (Roughly, for a propositional language
the strategy is that if one wants to show that given a certain Hilbert-style proof
system a formula φ is independent of a premise set Γ , one has to ﬁnd some many-
valued characterization of the connectives occurring in the language, on which all
33 A report on this talk Łukasiewicz (1928b) (written by Łukasiewicz himself) appeared also in the
same volume as the other report.
34 See Urbaniak (2008b, 85–92) for details.

6.8 Łukasiewicz and Ajdukiewicz on Deﬁnitions
157
assumptions in Γ have one of the chosen values, inference rules preserve chosen
value(s), and yet φ does not have a chosen value.). Indeed, to prove that a deﬁnition
is creative in a certain system one not only has to establish that with this deﬁnition
one can prove a certain formula, but also that this formula is not provable in the
system itself, i.e. that it is independent of the original axioms.
Second, it is still rather unclear what role creativity plays in arguments against the
object-language treatment of deﬁnitions. What Łukasiewicz seems to have proven
is that if certain deﬁnitions are accepted as theorems, they are creative. But even if
one values non-creativity, to turn this into an argument against the object-language
treatment of deﬁnitions, one also has to show that once one switches to the meta-
linguistictreatmentofdeﬁnitions,non-creativityvanishes.Thishowever,primafacie,
seems unlikely: if you can prove a new χ with a theorem φ ≡ψ, you are also able
to prove the same χ with a meta-theoretical rule that captures this equivalence.
Thus it appears probable that (at least in some contexts) the distinction between the
creative and the conservative cuts across the one between the intra-theoretic and the
meta-theoretical.
Third, the debate emphasizing the importance of non-creativity seems to stem
from Le´sniewski’s view of deﬁnitions as theorems, even if it was not Le´sniewski who
formulated the requirement: this at least partly explains what Le´sniewski’s impact
on these matters was and why his name came to be connected with the standard
requirements. Łukasiewicz’s report also constitutes evidence for the claim that once
Le´sniewski was faced with the non-creativity requirement he rejected it.
Now we may turn to Ajdukiewicz’s contribution. Ajdukiewicz discusses trans-
latability (which is, mutatis mutandis, the same as eliminability) and consistency
requirements in a lecture script (in Polish) which dates back to 1928. Ajdukiewicz
used these notes when he was teaching in Warsaw. (Those parts of Ajdukiewicz
(1928) that pertain to deﬁnitions have been published in Polish in 1960.)
Furthermore, translatability, consistency and conservativeness requirements are
discussed in a paper Ajdukiewicz (1936) gave later in Paris.35 As it will turn out by
35 In the 1956 edition of Tarski’s Logic, Semantics, and Metamathematics, in the translation of Tarski
(1934), ‘consistency and re-translatability’ are mentioned as ‘the conditions for a correct deﬁnition’
[307, n. 3]. At the same page of the 1983 edition the criteria are ‘non-creativity and eliminability’.
This puzzling fact is noticed by Hodges (2008). Paolo Mancosu pointed out an interesting passage
concerning the second edition, written by Tarski in his correspondence with Corcoran:
Replace “re-translatability” by “non-creativity”. [I do not explain the meaning of the term
“non-creativity” for the same reason why I did not explain before the meaning of “re-
translatability”. I have never intended to make LSM a self-contained work. By the way,
re-translatability is a stronger property than “non-creativity”. In old times it was frequently
used in discussing deﬁnitions. It seems that now “non-creativity” is more fashionable.]
Tarski might have been alluding to the work done in the theory of deﬁnability back in the 1960s
and 1970s. One of the results was that (supposing consistency) the eliminability of a term is a
necessary and sufﬁcient condition for its explicit deﬁnability within the given theory, whereas
conservativeness is only sufﬁcient: some weaker forms of deﬁnability imply the latter property as
well (See Rantala 1977, 179–185). But for some reason the 1983 footnote does not read ‘consistency
and non-creativity’, which would have been the weaker criteria.

158

Le´sniewski and Deﬁnitions
the end of this section, Ajdukiewicz not only mentions these rules, but also provides
some proofs concerning them.
In the introduction to a collection of his papers, around 30years after having
written the script, Ajdukiewicz (1960, v–vi) explains his motivation behind the 1928
and 1936 papers by saying that he tried to understand what the ultimate goal of
structural rules for deﬁnitions are. He contrast his own approach to Le´sniewski’s
rules which were purely syntactical.
Ajdukiewicz observes what we have already learned in the previous sections:
Le´sniewski was not concerned with general conditions on deﬁnitions formulated in
terms of derivability, but rather with the project of deﬁning derivability in terms of
syntactic relations, which includes a purely syntactic description of what a deﬁnition
should look like. Ajdukiewicz himself, however, was after more general conditions:
those directly related to the purpose a deﬁnition should serve in a system.
In the 1928 script, which is titled The main principles of methodology of sciences
and formal logic (Główne zasady metodologii nauk i logiki formalnej), Ajdukiewicz
ﬁrst introduces the notion of being a meaningful expression relative to (a background
theory consisting of) sentences Z: An expression W is, in this sense, meaningful if it
contains only such constants which are equiform with one of the constants occurring
in Z, and if its syntax obeys the syntax of Z. [Par. 12, p. 45].
The notion of a meaningful expression is used in paragraph 19 titled Rules of
Deﬁnitions (Dyrektywy deﬁniowania) to introduce the requirements of translatability
and consistency, pretty much as we know them. Say we extend the language of Z,
JZ, i.e. ‘the set of sentences meaningful relative to Z’, to a new language JZ+D by
using a deﬁnition D to introduce an expression δ, which is new relative to Z. The ﬁrst
condition Ajdukiewicz introduces is translatability which requires that any sentence
in JZ+D should (modulo accepted inference rules and theory Z + D) be inferentially
equivalent to a sentence in JZ. The second condition he introduces is consistency: if
Z was consistent (relative to given inference rules which are kept ﬁxed) then Z + D
also has to be consistent. (Ajdukiewicz 1928, 46–47).
Non-creativity, even though not mentioned in 1928, receives attention only a few
years later. (1936, 244), after pretty much repeating his previous formulation of
translatability and consistency requirements, remarks that…
…Often, but not always, one also wishes the rules of deﬁnitions to exclude creative deﬁni-
tions. A deﬁnition is called creative on the grounds of a certain language, if from the theses
of that language according to the rules of deduction by means of that deﬁnition it is possible
to derive a sentence of that language (and so, not containing the deﬁned term), which cannot
be derived without that deﬁnition.
In other words he claims that sometimes one requires also that no formulas of the
old language which were not theorems of the original theory become derivable in the
theory obtained by adding a deﬁnition. This is exactly the non-creativity mentioned
e.g. by Suppes (1957, 153),36 by Łukasiewicz (see above), and already by Frege:
In fact it is not possible to prove something new from a deﬁnition alone that would be
unprovable without it. When something that looks like a deﬁnition really makes it possible
36 See the quotation in Sect.6.3.

6.8 Łukasiewicz and Ajdukiewicz on Deﬁnitions
159
to prove something which could not be proved before, then it is no mere deﬁnition but must
conceal something which would have either to be proved as a theorem or accepted as an
axiom. (Frege 1914, 208)
Although it is unlikely that Ajdukiewicz independently reinvented the condi-
tions of eliminability and conservativeness (as they are called nowadays), what sets
him apart from his predecessors and contemporaries is his genuinely meta-meta-
theoretical treatment of these criteria.37 He, for instance, not only mentions non-
creativity in (1936, 245–246), but also attempts to ﬁnd formal conditions whose
satisfaction by a system guarantees the non-creativity of deﬁnitions within the sys-
tem. He assumes the consistency requirement and argues that if the rules of inference
cannotdistinguishbetweenconstants,deﬁnitionsarenon-creativeonaratherstraight-
forward condition of irrelevancy of the deﬁned terms for the language’s inference
rules (i.e. that derivability is preserved under uniform substitution).
Given this assumption of “irrelevancy”, the argument that the consistency require-
mentis(insuchasetting)sufﬁcientfornon-creativitybecomesratherstraightforward.
Suppose a deﬁnition D of a word W leads to inconsistency with premises Z, where
formulas in Z do not contain W. Then we can with a substitution of D, which instead
of W contains an expression of the same category but occurring already in Z, derive
a contradiction just from Z as well. So for D to satisfy the consistency requirement
it is sufﬁcient that Z derives an instance of the deﬁnition which is constructed within
the language of Z. Of course, if the consistency requirement is not satisﬁed then
deﬁnitions will be creative, allowing for the derivation of ⊥which was underivable
in the system devoid of deﬁnitions.
Ajdukiewicz observes that a similar reasoning applies to creativity. If a W-free
formula φ is to be derivable from D with Z, then if Z already proves a W-free
instance of D then Z also proves φ.
It should be clear how this applies to the creativity of Le´sniewski’s deﬁnitions.
The condition sufﬁcient for non-creativity discussed by Ajdukiewicz requires that
no constants should be distinguished in the system. In QN Ld f it is clearly violated:
it is possible to derive expression (6.3) from Sect.6.6, that is:
∀a [a ε λ ≡a ε a ∧¬a ε a]
but (without the deﬁnition itself) it is neither possible to derive an instance of it:
∀a [a ε b ≡a ε a ∧¬a ε a]
nor its existential generalization:
37 For example, we do not ﬁnd such approach in Frege (1914), Łukasiewicz (1929) or Suppes (1957).
More recently, however, Ajdukiewicz’s interest in the criteria reappear independently in e.g. Belnap
(1993)andDošenandSchroeder-Heister(1985).Yet,sincethehistoryofthestandardtheoryremains
still unwritten, the study of little-known sources can, as our discussion here demonstrates, reveal
some surprises.

Le´sniewski and Deﬁnitions
∃b ∀a [a ε b ≡a ε a ∧¬a ε a].
In a sense, the whole point of introducing a deﬁnition in QN Ld f is to distinguish
one constant and to be able to prove about it something not provable about any other
constant. Also, in a way, it is the idea that all we need is instances of deﬁnitions that
stands behind the move to QN Lcom and the conservativeness of deﬁnitions in that
system.
Later Ajdukiewicz (1958) presented a sketch of what he called ‘a general theory
of deﬁnitions’ which would treat about all types of deﬁnitions: real, nominal, and
conventional, and which would reveal the logical relations between these classes of
deﬁnitions. On both of these tasks the criteria of translatability and non-creativity
(latter in a disguise of a need to proof existence) are utilized.38
Tosumup,ŁukasiewiczandAjdukiewiczinthe1920sand1930sbothmentionand
usetheconsistency, translatability, andconservativeness requirements for deﬁnitions.
Ajdukiewicz studied them and indicated one source of the creativity of deﬁnitions
in some systems: the fact that certain constants are in such systems, so to speak,
distinguished.
6.9 Remarks
Wehavetriedtoprovideanswerstothreesetsofproblems:(i)wheredidtheideathatit
was Le´sniewski who introduced the restrictions of eliminability and conservativeness
originate and why has this impression been around for so long? (ii) is the conviction
true at all, i.e. was it really Le´sniewski who established these requirements and, if
not, what was his actual stance on deﬁnitions? (iii) if not Le´sniewski then who in fact
presented and studied the meta-theoretical criteria of good deﬁnitions in Poland?
Let us brieﬂy summarize our ﬁndings. The myth about Le´sniewski’s role has died
hard because:
1. It is general knowledge that Le´sniewski’s works on deﬁnitions are of importance,
2. Le´sniewski is often praised for having introduced precise rules for deﬁnitions
by authors who leave the nature of those rules obscure (e.g. Luschei 1962), or
even misrepresent them (e.g. Suppes 1957), and the inﬂuence of some of these
texts has been tremendous,
3. the accessibility of Le´sniewski’s works has been low: the English translation of
his collected works dates back only to 199139 and given his idiosyncratic style
and the complexity of his formulations the translations are not much easier to
read (even for non-Polish and non-German speakers),
38 Ajdukiewicz’s general theory could be more fruitful theoretical basis for a practical account of
deﬁnitions used in computer science and network technologies than, for instance, that of Robinson
(1954), whose system is developed further in Cregan (2005).
39 Some of Le´sniewski’s texts have been translated before, most notably Le´sniewski (1931b) in the
important collection of papers by Polish logicians: (McCall 1967).

6.9 Remarks
161
4. further, the availability of the relevant works by Łukasiewicz and by
Ajdukiewicz is even lower, especially for non-Polish readers.40
With high plausibility we can state that it was not Le´sniewski who introduced
translatability, consistency and conservativeness requirements for deﬁnitions; and,
for certain, he did not study them:
5. Le´sniewski’s use of creative deﬁnitions appears essential to his systems,
6. Le´sniewski’s rules of deﬁnitions are concerned only with the syntactic form of
deﬁnitions as admitted in particular systems,
7. Le´sniewski does not bring up eliminability and non-creativity requirements even
as potential desiderata of good deﬁnitions anywhere in his writings (not even in
those bits which are devoted to deﬁnitions),
8. Ajdukiewicz, who was familiar with Le´sniewski’s work and knew him person-
ally, also states that Le´sniewski has formulated no meta-theoretical requirements
for deﬁnitions (and this fact was, according to Rickey (1975b), conﬁrmed by
B. Soboci´nski as well).
Most importantly, we have found good reasons to believe that it was Łukasiewicz
whobroughttheissueup,andAjdukiewiczwhowasﬁrsttoprovideameta-theoretical
study of how the criteria of conservativeness affect the deﬁnitions, at least on the
Polish ground:
9. Łukasiewicz in 1928 uses the conservativeness requirement to argue against the
intra-theoretic treatment of deﬁnitions and presents the criterion in his lecture
script (although he does not credit himself with its formulation),
10 Ajdukiewiczdescribesthetranslatabilityandconsistencyrequirementsexplicitly
in 1928,
11. Ajdukiewicz mentions and studies, with respect to some other meta-theoretical
conditions, conservative deﬁnitions in 1936,
12. Ajdukiewicz seems to be crediting not Le´sniewski but himself with the claim that
the goal of Le´sniewski’s syntactic restrictions is to satisfy the meta-theoretical
requirements Ajdukiewicz mentioned in 1928.
There still are many open questions pertaining to the history of the standard
account of deﬁnitions (as well as to the history of the non-standard account of cre-
ative and/or circular deﬁnitions). For instance, what happened during the 20 year
gap between the works of Frege, Peano, Russell and Whitehead, and the works of
Łukasiewicz, Le´sniewski and Ajdukiewicz? How does Dubislav ﬁt into the picture?
There seems to be room for a more extensive study of Peano’s group as well.
As is clear from our discussion, the study of the Polish golden age of philosophy
and logic, i.e. the time between Kazimierz Twardowski’s (1866–1938) appointment
as a professor at Lvov in the end of nineteenth century and the Second World War,
might be sometimes surprising.
Even if some pieces of the puzzle are still missing, it seems we can now at least
conclude: The myth about Le´sniewski and deﬁnitions is (almost) deﬁnitely busted.

Chapter 7
Sets Revisited
Abstract I discuss various attempts to emulate standard set theory within the
framework of Le´sniewski’s system: the Le´sniewski–Soboci´nski strategy of distin-
guishing between collective and distributive totalities (a heap of stones is a collective
totality; a set of chairs is not) I show the strategy, as used by Soboci´nski, leads to
a few paradoxes. Further, I argue that using the means available within Ontology
itself does not result in a theory strong enough to mimic set theory. I then describe
Słupecki’s generalized mereology and argue that it is too different from set theory to
be able to play a foundational role.
7.1 Distributive Classes
Intuitively, there is in English a name-forming functor of one name argument. This
functor forms with its argument a name of the class of all and only those objects which
are named by its argument. It is ‘the class of ’ (henceforth ‘cl’). So, for instance, we
speak of the class of integers, the class of bears, the class of contradictory objects
(presumably, it is the empty class), and so on.
While I already covered the mereological notion of a class in this book, the
functor I now have in mind is distributive, as opposed to the collective class-forming
functor. In the collective sense the class of a’s is the result of collecting them into one
mereological whole. In the distributive sense, the property of being an a distributes
over the elements of the class of a’s, so that whatever belongs to the class of a’s is
an a. In this distributive sense, the following sentences seem compelling:
(7.1) My dog’s leg is not an element of the class of dogs.
(7.2) The class of integers is not an element of the class of integers.
(7.3) The class of the class of elephants is not the same as the class of elephants.
(7.4) My dog is an element of the class of dogs. The class of dogs is an element of the class
of classes of animals But my dog is not an element of the class of classes of animals.

Sets Revisited
These are examples of sentences true in the distributive reading and false in the
collective interpretation.1 The ﬁrst sentence indicates that the notion of distributive
element is different from parthood: a part of an element of a class does not have to
be an element of this class. Distributively speaking, the relation of being an element
is not reﬂexive. It is also sensitive to iterations and intransitive.
In this distributive sense I will take for granted the following:
∀a, b[b ε el(a) ≡∃c (aεcl(c) ∧bεc)]
(7.5)
where el(a) is read as an element of a. It states that an object b is an element of a
if and only if there is a possible name c such that a is the class of all and only those
objects that are c and b is c. (7.5) will constitute the hard core of most things which
follow in this chapter.
It is not clear how Le´sniewski would account for this sort of distributive intuitions.
Perhaps, Le´sniewski would say that the only irreducible sense of the word ‘class’
is that formalized by Mereology. After all, he employed mereological intuitions to
reject (2.72) (see page xx of this book).2 Perhaps, he would concede that there are
two interpretations of the notion of a class involved. At least, this is the way that
Le´sniewski’s student, Soboci´nski (1949), interpreted the situation. We will take a
closer look at what the latter has to say in Sect.7.4, but before we do that, let us
revisit Russell’s paradox once again, this time within the formal framework.
7.2 Russell’s Paradox Again
The ﬁrst attempt to extend (7.5) to a substantial theory may consist in adding the
following axioms:
∀a∃b (bεcl(a))
(7.6)
1 It is important to emphasize that the question I am concerned with is not whether there is a way
of introducing into the language of Ontology a formal counterpart of the expression ‘the class of’
which would mimic correctly Le´sniewski’s understanding of this term (which was quite unusual),
but rather how the expression ‘the class of’ in the nowadays most common, set-theoretic use can
be imitated in the language of Le´sniewski’s systems. Thus, even if Le´sniewski would not share the
intuitions behind the examples above, it does not matter. The point is that the sense of ‘the class of’
in which the above examples come out true seems to be a legitimate and widespread understanding
of the expression in question and Mereology falls short of accounting for this plausibility.
2 There is an intriguing comment on Le´sniewski’s philosophical method made by Twardowski:
“In general, those who follow Le´sniewski, very arbitrarily demand an analysis where they ﬁnd it
convenient; however, whenever someone demand an analysis where it is inconvenient, they refer to
intuition. And when the opponent in the discussion tries at some point to refer to intuition as well,
they respond: “We cannot understand what you claim to be intuitively given”. (K. Twardowski’s
Diary, ms. 2407/3)”. [The quote comes from Kazimerz Twardowski’s archive, located in the library
of the Institute of Philosophy and Sociology of the Polish Academy of Sciences, Warsaw. The

7.2 Russell’s Paradox Again
167
∀a, b, c, d[aεcl(c) ∧cl(d) ∧bεc →bεd]
(7.7)
(7.6) is full comprehension and (7.7) says that a class can be determined only by
names of the same extension.
Unfortunately, this will not work. We can easily deﬁne a name ⋆by:
∀a[aε⋆≡aεa ∧∀b(aεcl(b) →¬aεb)]
(7.8)
The existence of cl(⋆) is guaranteed by (7.6). The class is something similar to the
Russell’s class. (Although note that it does not even require that a be a class in order
to be ⋆.) Clearly, (7.6), (7.7) with (7.8) imply contradiction.3
Theorem 7.1 (Soboci´nski) (7.6) (7.7) (7.8) ⊢⊥.
To see why this holds consider the following proof:
1
a ε ⋆→(a ε cl(⋆) →¬a ε ⋆)

3 The ﬁrst four theorems in this chapter have been proven in a rather tedious manner by Soboci´nski
(who credits Le´sniewski with the proofs). I give simpliﬁed and streamlined proof sketches based
on Soboci´nski’s proofs.

Sets Revisited
Maybe something is wrong with (7.6)? Let us try to weaken this assumption to
the following:
∀a, b[bεa →∃ccεcl(a)]
(7.9)
This restricts comprehension to non-empty names. On Le´sniewski’s view, this might
be more intuitive, because he did not believe in empty classes. However, the problem
remains. Assume (7.9) and (7.7). These assumptions together with (7.8) lead to the
conclusion that if an object is a class of b’s, it is b itself:
∀a, b[aεcl(b) →aεb]
(7.10)
Theorem 7.2 (7.9), (7.7), (7.8) ⊢(7.10).
Start the proof as above and continue from line 11:
1

∃Elim: 5, 6⇒8
10

The problem is, (7.10) agrees neither with the distributive nor with the collective
notion of a class. For neither the distributive class of natural numbers is a natural
number itself nor the collective mereological fusions of all lizards in the world is a
lizard.

7.2 Russell’s Paradox Again
169
There is even a worse problem. To see it, we ﬁrst need the following lemma:
∀a, b, c[aεa ∧cεcl(a ∪b) ∧bεc →a = b]
(7.11)
The proof is:
1
a ε a ∧c ε cl(a ∪b) ∧b ε c
Assumption
2
b ε b
Ontology: 1
3
a ε a ∪b

11
a = b
Ontology: 2, 10
12

Now, it turns out that the current axioms entail that there exists at most one object:
∀a, b[aεa ∧bεb →aεb]
(7.12)
which seems even more problematic than (7.10).
Theorem 7.3 (Soboci´nski) (7.7), (7.8), (7.9) ⊢(7.12).
Here is the proof:

7.3 Remark on Frege’s Way Out
Frege in 1903 suggested weakening something like (7.7) to an assumption that may
be expressed in Le´sniewski’s system by:
∀a, b, c, d[aεcl(c) ∧aεcl(d) ∧bεd ∧¬bεcl(d) →bεc]
(7.13)
It says that if one and the same thing is the class of c’s and the class of d’s, then
extensionality holds (whatever is a d is also a c), but it is restricted to those objects
which are not the class itself. This move is commonly referred to as Frege’s way out.
Unfortunately, in 1938 Le´sniewski showed that (7.13) and (7.9) lead to contra-
diction with two additional assumptions:
∀a, b, c[aεcl(c) ∧bεcl(c) →a = b]
(7.14)
∃a, b, c [aεa ∧bεb ∧cεc ∧a ̸= b ∧a ̸= c ∧b ̸= c]
(7.15)
The ﬁrst of them states the uniqueness of the class of objects a, the second states
that there are at least three different objects:

7.3 Remark on Frege’s Way Out
171
Theorem 7.4 (Soboci´nski) (7.9), (7.13), (7.14), (7.15) ⊢⊥
The proof is somewhat tedious, so I skip it. The reader might check Soboci´nski’s
original paper for details, or (Urbaniak 2008) for a slightly simpler reconstruction.
The issue of whether Frege’s way out leads to inconsistency has been debated for
a while. Quine (1955) credits Le´sniewski and provides his own version of the proof.
Geach (1956) describes a generalization of Le´sniewski’s proof. Linsky and Schumm
(1971) emphasize that Frege’s way out, contrary to the common view, does not lead
to inconsistency, but rather yields a system which is metaphysically false, severely
limiting the number of existing objects (they also give an even simpler proof). They
argue the system is satisﬁable in a domain with only one element. Dummet (1973)
argues that in fact, Frege’s system is inconsistent, because he takes truth values to be
objects and proves within his system that there are at least two truth values. Frege’s
way out is however still defended by Landini (2006). The issue is too complicated
and too off-topic to be settled in this chapter. Let us get back to what Soboci´nski had
to say about distributive classes.
7.4 Soboci´nski on Distributive Classes
Soboci´nski in his paper devoted to Le´sniewski’s resolution of Russell’s paradox
claims:
The expression ‘class(a)’ in the distributive sense is nothing more than a ﬁctitious name
which replaces the well-known term of classical logic, ‘the extension of the objects a’.
If one takes the term in this sense, the formula ‘bεcl(a)’ means the same thing as ‘b is an
element of the extension of the objects a’ or, more brieﬂy, ‘b is a’. In which case, the formula
‘Socrates is cl(white)’ means the same thing as ‘Socrates is an element of the extension of
white objects’; in other words: ‘Socrates is white’. Thus, the understanding of ‘class’ in the
distributive sense would reduce the formula ‘bεcl(a)’ to the purely logical formula ‘bεa’,
where ‘ ε ’ is understood as the connective of the individual proposition. (Soboci´nski 1949,
p. 31)
Soboci´nski does something quite unexpected here. For some reason he reads
‘εcl(a)’ as ‘is an element of the extension of the objects a’. Recall that ‘cl(a)’ is just
the formal version of ‘the extension of the name a ’. But if that is the case, ε is no
longer being read by Soboci´nski as ‘is’, but rather as ‘is an element of’. However,
this reading is plainly wrong given the interpretation given to ε by Le´sniewski.
While the reading is quite counterintuitive, it is still interesting to see what happens
with the paradoxical assumptions on this reading. Replace α1εcl(α2) with α1εα2 in
those assumptions. (7.6) becomes
∀a∃b bεa
(7.16)
which is disprovable in Ontology (basically because it says that every possible name
is non–empty and in Ontology one can deﬁne the empty name and obtain the negation
of (7.16) by existential quantiﬁer introduction). (7.7) is read as

172
7
Sets Revisited
∀a, b, c, d[aεc ∧aεd ∧bεd →bεc]
(7.17)
which, again, is disprovable in Ontology. (7.9) turns out to be provable
∀b, c[bεc →∃a aεc]
(7.18)
(7.13) becomes:
∀a, b, c, d[aεc ∧aεd ∧bεd ∧¬bεd →bεa]
(7.19)
which is tautologically true. (7.14) turns out to be unprovable and false in most
non-trivial models:
∀a, b, c[aεc ∧bεc →a = b]
(7.20)
What happens to (7.5) on this reading? It becomes:
∀a, b[bεel(a) ≡∃c (aεc ∧bεc)]
(7.21)
which is certainly absurd. Take any two singular names, a, b. Clearly aεa ∪b∧bεa
∪b. Thus, ∃c (aεc ∧bεc). But then, aεel(b) and bεel(a), that is, it turns out that
any two individuals are elements of each other. This, again, is a slightly inconvenient
conclusion.
Overall, this interpretation does allow us to avoid undesired paradoxical conclu-
sions. But this happens because quite compelling assumptions on this formalization
become (at least in most of the cases) trivially false claims. This discrepancy, instead
of providing a solution to the paradoxes, undermines the adequacy of Soboci´nski’s
interpretation.
7.5 Does not Ontology Contain Some Set Theory Already?
Is not our effort pointless? Is there a need to introduce cl on top of Ontology? Is not
Ontology a set theory already? For instance, if one develops a standard set-theoretic
semantics for Ontology (name variables range over the power set of the domain of
individuals etc.), something very much like the axiom of choice can be expressed in
the language of Ontology by:
∃f ∀a, b(aεb →f (b)εa)
(7.22)
which in the set-theoretic interpretation can be read as stating that there is an f such
that for every non-empty set b, f (b) is an element of b (see Davis 1975 for details).
Davis himself uses set-theoretic paraphrases throughout his paper, commenting
brieﬂy:

7.5 Does not Ontology Contain Some Set Theory Already?
173
Set theoretic paraphrases will be used throughout this investigation since they are the most
natural to use in discussions concerning the axiom of choice (Davis 1975, p. 182).
This line of reasoning is familiar. It resembles the standard argument for the claim
that the standard second-order logic is set theory in sheep’s clothing.
We need to distinguish between two questions. One is whether Ontology as it is,
given that it involves higher-order quantiﬁcation, involves ontological commitment
to sets. This issue will be tackled in Chap.8. Another question, relevant to our current
considerations, is whether it is possible to emulate within Ontology enough set theory
to obtain major mathematical theories.
The mere fact that set-theoretic paraphrases are convenient in a discussion does
not imply that the paraphrased language indeed says something about sets. Nor does
it show that the theory in question is rich enough to go proxy for set theory. At most,
one can say that if the language is given standard set-theoretic semantics then it is
possible to formulate in it formulas that are true in a model iff a speciﬁc set-theoretic
axiom(s) (formulated in metalanguage) hold(s) in the same model.
This might suggest that at least some facts usually stated in set theory are express-
ible in the language of Ontology. However, even though formulas of Ontology may
have the same satisfaction conditions as certain set-theoretic claims, the language
of Ontology itself does not contain a systematic device which would emulate the
behavior of the usual set-theoretic jargon.
For instance, there is a certain interesting translation along these lines:
Class a is a subset of the class b ∀c(cεa →cεb)
Class a is empty
¬∃b bεa
Classes a and b are disjoint
¬∃c (cεa ∧cεb)
Still, the language of Ontology is far from the generality enjoyed by the language
of set theory. Let us take a closer look at (7.22). Take the common-sense set-theoretic
semantics. We start with a possibly empty set of urelements, then construct the
power set to obtain the range of name variables, and similarly for all other semantic
categories. In this setting (7.22) says only that for any non-empty set of urelements
there is a function that selects an element of that set. This is (not) the same as
saying that for any nonempty family of pairwise disjoint nonempty sets there is a
function which assigns to each element of that family a unique element of the input
set. Of course, in Ontology we can emulate “nonempty family of pairwise disjoint
nonempty sets of urelements” and similarly for any other “type” or “order” of the
usual set-theoretic objects. But there is no single formula of Ontology which is true
in a model if and only if the set-theoretic axiom of choice in its full generality holds
for all semantic categories. We have to introduce an axiom-of-choice-like formula
for every semantic category separately. Now, since the language of Ontology has no
upper limit on how complex semantic categories can get, this means that the best
we could do is to suggest a choice schema under which all those particular choice
axioms would fall. But this is quite different from being able to express the axiom
by means of a single formula of set theory.

174

Sets Revisited
There is another possibility to explore: perhaps, there is a sensible translation from
the language of standard set theory into the language of Ontology which preserves
our intuitions about distributive classes, and (hopefully) theorems of an interesting
set theory. We will take a closer look at this option now.
7.6 Higher-Order Epsilon: The Basics
Recall that the question which launched the discussion about distributive classes was:
how to imitate the usual talk about distributive classes in a language of Ontology or a
language based on this language? As we have already seen, Le´sniewski–Soboci´nski’s
solution to the Russell’s paradox did not work very well: the mereological approach
seems like the change of topic, and Soboci´nski’s deﬂationary interpretation clearly
fails.
Some preliminary work on an alternative approach has been suggested by
Lejewski (1985), who tried to develop a “class-talk” within Ontology. He did so
by introducing class-like operators, and a new sort of functors needed to mimic
predication between such class terms. Predication operators of this sort are called
higher-order epsilon operators (HOε).
Lejewski’s approach was advertised in the context of Russell’s paradox by (1972,
pp. 42–44), who was quite optimistic. He claimed that the approach “gives one
acceptable sense to the principle that there are classes of whatever sorts of objects
one may specify” (Henry 1972, p. 44), and that “intuitive clarity can be maintained
throughout, [a] version of the [Russell’s] paradox is avoided, and ad hoc evasive
strategems of a formalist nature shown to be needless” (Henry 1972, p. 46).
I will start with explaining brieﬂy what higher-order epsilon operators are. Then
I will consider a few ways they can be introduced. Next, I will investigate the cash
value of Henry’s claims and show what happens if one actually applies Lejewski’s
strategy to Russell’s paradox.
The basic idea is that instead of treating cl(a) as a name of a class, we put it in a
semantic category different from the category of names and treat ‘is’ as ambiguous.
For example, ‘Socrates is a philosopher’ is parsed as sεp, but a sentence of a similar
form, ‘Reading is learning’ is, if we follow Le´sniewskian intuitions, not a sentence
directly about objects. It rather is taken to mean that anything which reads, learns.
This sort of approach can be systematized in Le´sniewski’s Ontology. Deﬁne the
weak identity ﬁrst:
∀a, b[◦(a, b) ≡∀c(cεa ≡cεb)]
(7.23)
(Observe that it also holds between empty terms.) Now, every one-place sentential
functor of a name argument can be nominalized:4
4 In the original notation of the papers at issue parentheses surrounding arguments of different
categories were of different shapes. For the sake of convenience I follow this aspect of the original
notation, as well as I keep using φ as a functor variable. There is no obvious assignment of shapes of

7.6 Higher-Order Epsilon: The Basics
175
∀a, φ[aεtrm⟨φ⟩≡aεa ∧φ(a)]
(7.24)
Thereareatleasttwoclass-likeoperatorswemightwanttointroduce.Oneismeant
to help one to speak of classes of objects satisfying a certain formula, one is meant
to help one to speak of classes of objects falling under a certain term. Accordingly,
read ‘cl[[φ]](a)’ as ‘a is the class of those objects that φ-ize’ and ‘[[a]](b)’ as ‘b is
the class of a’s’. Deﬁne these by:
∀a, b[cl[[a]](b) ≡◦(b, a)]
(7.25)
∀a, φ[cl[[φ]](a) ≡cl[[trm⟨φ⟩]](a)]
(7.26)
(These deﬁnitions do not interpret class terms as actually referring expressions:
cl[[a]](b) only means that b has the same extension as a, and cl[[φ]](a) only means
that a refers to exactly those objects which satisfy φ.)
The trick now is to deﬁne a predication copula for such “fake” terms which could
mimic some of our class talk. For this, we need a higher-order epsilon ε1 deﬁned by:
∀φ, ψ[φε1ψ ≡∃a (φ(a) ∧ψ(a)) ∧∀b, c(φ(b) ∧φ(c) →◦(b, c))]
(7.27)
which, if you deﬁne:
∀φ[ext⟨φ⟩≡∀b, c(φ(b) ∧φ(c) →◦(b, c))]
(7.28)
where ext⟨φ⟩may be read as ‘φ’ determines a unique possible name, up to coexten-
siveness (or, in other words, φ determines a class) may be expressed by:
∀φ, ψ[φε1ψ ≡∃a (φ(a) ∧ψ(a)) ∧ext⟨φ⟩)]
(7.29)
Intuitively speaking, φε1ψ is true if there is only one (up to coextensiveness) name
of which φ can be truly predicated and it is one of the names of which ψ can be truly
predicated.
The following theorem5 indicates the contrast between the regular ε and the
higher-order ε1:
Theorem 7.5 The following are provable in Ontology:
∀a[cl[[a]]ε1cl[[a]] ]
(7.30)
∀φ[cl[[φ]]ε1cl[[φ]] ]
(7.31)
(Footnote 4 continued)
brackets to semantic categories, I will just arbitrarily pick different shapes for different categories
for the purposes of this chapter.
5 Most of theorems and proof sketches about higher-order epsilon operators have been developed
by the author.

¬∀aaεa
(7.32)
Proof
From (7.23) we get
∀a[◦(a, a) ≡∀c[cεa ≡cεa]]
(7.33)
the right side of the equivalence follows from ∀p(p ≡p) (a trivial theorem of
Protothetic). Thus ∀a ◦(a, a). From (7.25) we get:
∀a, b[cl[[a]](a)]
(7.34)
From (7.27):
∀a[cl[[a]] ε1 cl[[a]] ≡∃b (cl[[a]](b) ∧cl[[a]](b)) ∧ext⟨cl[[a]] ⟩]
(7.35)
Clearly ∃b (cl[[a]](b)∧cl[[a]](b)) follows from (7.34). To show that ∀a(ext⟨cl[[a]] ⟩),
suppose that cl[[a]](b) and cl[[a]](c). By (7.25), ◦(a, b), ◦(a, c), and it is trivial that
◦is symmetric and transitive (that results from the symmetry and transitivity of
equivalence). Thus we get (7.30). To show (7.31) just note that (7.30) implies
∀φ, a[cl[[trm⟨φ⟩]](a)ε1 cl[[trm⟨φ⟩]](a)]
(7.36)
and use (7.26). On the other hand to obtain (7.32), deﬁne:
∀a[aε ≡aεa ∧¬aεa]
(7.37)
Clearly, ¬ε.
7.7 Higher-Order Epsilon and Russell’s Paradox
Let us temporarily assume that we can mimic the talk about distributive classes using
the above strategy. What happens if we employ it to discuss Russell’s paradox as
formulated by Le´sniewski and Soboci´nski? Here is a sketch of the discussion.
Take the paradoxical axioms used earlier in this chapter. Can they be interpreted
using the above strategy? It turns out that we have to play around with the language
in order to be able to translate them into the language of Ontology. Also, there is no
unique possible way of massaging the axioms into the language of Ontology.
• One of the options entails that only if a is a singular term there exists the class of
a’s, which means that this reading falls short of imitating the usual set-theoretic
talk.
• Another way of translating the axioms turns (7.7) into a formula which entails that
aε cl[[b]] is equivalent to aεb, which is not a plausible identiﬁcation if we want

7.7 Higher-Order Epsilon and Russell’s Paradox
177
to stick with the distributive reading (without running into the already discussed
conclusion that for any two individuals one is an element of another). It also seems,
in this reading we lose the extensionality of distributive sets (which generally is
not a good news if we want to imitate the usual language of set theory).
• Finally, I discuss yet another quite natural reading. Interestingly, translating for-
mulas that were contradictory on the previous reading using this strategy yields a
set of theorems of Ontology (which we have good reasons to believe to be consis-
tent), but this indicates that the original set-theoretic consequence is not preserved
under translation.
Now that a philosophical guide has been sketched, let us get back to the trenches.
Consider axiom 7.6:
∀a∃b bεcl(a)
(7.38)
When we try to parse it using a higher-order epsilon, we see that neither b ε1 [[a]]
nor b ε cl[[a]] are well-formed. The standard ε takes two expressions of category n
as arguments and is of category
s
nn . The ε1 operator, on the other hand, takes two
expressions of category s
n as its arguments and is of category
s
s
n , s
n . There are two
basic options: we can deﬁne a new higher-order epsilon of category
s
n s
n that mixes
these two and use it in parsing the formulae, or we can somehow modify the semantic
category of one of the arguments of an epsilon in the original formula. Let us start
with the ﬁrst option.
(i)
Take another epsilon:
∀a, φ[aε2φ ≡aεa ∧φ(a)]
(7.39)
(7.6) in this reading renders:
∀a∃b [bεb ∧cl[[a]](b)]
(7.40)
but this implies ∃b bεb which is not a theorem of Ontology. Another consequence is
∀a∃b [bεb∧◦(a, b)] , and thus ∀a[aεa] (which contradicts (7.32) and is inconsistent
with the axioms of Ontology).
(7.7), another axiom, after translation yields:
∀a, b, c, d[aε2cl[[c]] ∧aε2cl[[d]] ∧bεd →bεc]
(7.41)
which is equivalent to:
∀a, b, c, d[aεa ∧cl[[c]](a) ∧cl[[d]](a) ∧bεd →bεc]
(7.42)
and
∀a, b, c, d[aεa ∧◦(c, a) ∧◦(d, a) ∧bεd →bεc]
(7.43)

178
7
Sets Revisited
which is a theorem of Ontology.
When we translate another axiom, (7.9), the translation is:
∀a, b[aεb →∃c cε2cl[[b]]]
(7.44)
which is equivalent to the formula:
∀a, b[aεb →∃c (cεc ∧cl[[b]](c))]
(7.45)
The reason why this formula should not hold is that it says that if b is non-empty, then
it is coextensive with a singular c. It ultimately says that all terms are either empty or
singular and thus restrict the domain cardinality to one object. (This is because we
could deﬁne the universal name by aεV ≡aεa and apply(7.45) to it, proving that it
is singular.)
The core of the problem is that (7.39), seemingly innocent, results in
∀a, b[aε2cl[[b]] ≡aεa ∧◦(a, b)]
(7.46)
which implies that only if b is a singular term, there is an a such that aε2cl[[b]].
(ii)
Let us try a more subtle deﬁnition of a higher-order epsilon.6
∀a, φ[aε3φ ≡aεa ∧∃b (aεb ∧φ(b))]
(7.47)
(7.9) yields:
∀a, b[aεb →∃c, d (cεd ∧cl[[b]](d))]
(7.48)
which is equivalent to:
∀a, b[aεb →∃c, d (cεd ∧◦(d, b))]
(7.49)
which is valid. But let us return to (7.6) and (7.7).
When we translate (7.6) using ε3, we get:
∀a∃b bε3cl[[a]]
(7.50)
This is equivalent to
∀a∃b [bεb ∧∃c (bεc ∧cl[[a]](c))]
(7.51)
i.e.
6 What makes a connective a higher-order epsilon is an interesting question. The intuition is that
f is an epsilon if the truth of f (δ, γ ) requires some sort of uniqueness of the referent(s) of δ
(presumably, up to coextensiveness), and some sort of inclusion between the referent(s) of δ and
the referent(s) of γ . This however is far from providing a formally correct and precise deﬁnition.

7.7 Higher-Order Epsilon and Russell’s Paradox
179
∀a∃b [bεb ∧∃c (bεc ∧◦(c, a))]
(7.52)
which is still not a theorem, because it implies ∃b bεb.
(7.7) renders:
∀a, b, c, d[aεa ∧∃e (aεe ∧◦(e, c)) ∧∃e (aεe ∧◦(e, d)) ∧bεd →bεc]
(7.53)
which is disprovable in Ontology.
Now, 7.7 in its initial form sounds like a pretty obvious claim about distributive
sets. Why does it fail in the new reading? Consider what aε3cl[[b]] boils down to:
aεa ∧∃c (aεc ∧◦(c, b))
(7.54)
that is,
∃c (aεc ∧◦(c, b))
(7.55)
and thus it is equivalent to aεb. But this identiﬁcation, as we already noticed, leads to
other troubles. Even more so if we try accept the corresponding translation of (7.5).
(iii)
Maybe we should go with another option and use ε1 in our translations, but instead of
name variables employ s
n -operator variables? Let us try. In this reading (7.6) yields:
∀a∃φ φε1cl[[a]]
(7.56)
that is:
∀a∃φ [∃b (φ(b) ∧cl[[a]](b)) ∧ext⟨φ⟩]
(7.57)
which is equivalent to:
∀a∃φ [∃b (φ(b) ∧◦(a, b)) ∧ext⟨φ⟩]
(7.58)
(7.58) follows from (7.30), which makes it a theorem.
Now, (7.7) becomes:
∀φ, a, b, c[φε1cl[[a]] ∧φε1cl[[b]] ∧cεb →cεa]
(7.59)
that is:
∀φ, a, b, c[∃d (φ(d) ∧cl[[a]](d)) ∧ext⟨φ⟩∧∃e (φ(e) ∧cl[[b]](e)) ∧cεb →cεa]
(7.60)
which is equivalent to:
∀φ, a, b, c[∃d (φ(d)∧◦(a, d))∧ext⟨φ⟩∧∃e (φ(e)∧◦(b, e))∧cεb →cεa] (7.61)

180
7
Sets Revisited
which is also a theorem.
Theorem 7.6 (7.61) is a theorem of Ontology.
Proof
Suppose: ∃d (φ(d) ∧◦(a, d)), ∀d, e (φ(d) ∧φ(e) →◦(d, e)), ∃e (φ(e) ∧
◦(b, e)), c ε b. Thus there are some δ and γ s.t. φ(δ) ∧◦(a, δ) and φ(γ ) ∧◦(b, γ ).
Also, φ(δ) ∧φ(γ ) →◦(δ, γ ). Hence: ◦(δ, γ ). By the transitivity of ◦, ◦(a, b) and
thus c ε a.
The problem is that (7.6) and (7.7) originally led to contradiction. If (7.56) and
(7.59) led to contradiction as well, it would have shown that Ontology is inconsistent.
Fortunately an adaptation of the original proof of Theorem 7.1 does not work.
One reason is that if we use the original deﬁnition of ⋆, then while line 11 would
still say ¬∃a aεcl[[⋆]], line 12 would not contradict it. For it would say ∃φ φε1cl[[⋆]]
which reduces to:
∃φ [∃b (φ(b) ∧◦(⋆, b)) ∧∀c, d(φ(c) ∧φ(d) →◦(c, d))]
This, however is trivially the case, for ¬∃a aεγ does an excellent job of φ(γ ).
Perhaps, we should deﬁne ⋆differently, employing the translation also to the class
term occurring in (7.8) and using ε1 instead of ε when talking about classes?
Strictly speaking, that cannot be the only modiﬁcation, because we also need to
change some of the name variable quantiﬁcation into formula variable quantiﬁcation.
So ﬁrst, deﬁne:
∀a, b[vrbm⟨a⟩(b) ≡bεa]
(7.62)
Then, in the original deﬁnition:
aε⋆≡aεa ∧∀b(aεcl(b) →¬aεb)
replace ‘aεcl(b)’ with ‘vrbm⟨a⟩ε1cl[[b]]’, thus obtaining:
aε⋆≡aεa ∧∀b(vrbm⟨a⟩ε1cl[[b]] →¬aεb)
There are two things to observe in this situation. One is that ‘vrbm⟨a⟩ε1cl[[b]]’ boils
down, subsequently, to:
∃c (vrbm⟨a⟩(c) ∧◦(a, c)) ∧ext(vrbm⟨a⟩)
(7.63)
∃c (cεa ∧◦(b, c)) ∧∀c, d(cεa ∧dεa →◦(c, d))
(7.64)
bεa ∧(aεa ∨¬∃c cεa)
(7.65)
Thus, the right-had side of the deﬁnition reduces to the disprovable formula:
aεa ∧∀b[bεa →¬aaεb]

7.7 Higher-Order Epsilon and Russell’s Paradox
181
and the deﬁnition of ⋆becomes just a deﬁnition of an empty term. The original
derivation of the contradiction in the proof of Theorem 7.1 also fails, for line 11
ends up being ¬∃a vrbm⟨a⟩ε1cl[[⋆]] and not contradicting line 12, which would say:
∃φ φε1cl[[⋆]]. The reason why there is no contradiction is that quantiﬁcation over
vrmb⟨a⟩terms is narrower than quantiﬁcation over all formulas φ (for instance,
vrbm⟨a⟩requires that a be non-empty, and not every formula φ does that).
In general
Ononehand,someofthetranslationsofproblematicaxiomsintohigher-orderepsilon
languageclearlyfail.Ontheother,atranslationwhichdoesnotfailisalsonotsuitable,
because the original consequence operation is not preserved under translation. One
could ask, am I not demanding the impossible by saying that the approach fails no
matter whether the translation preserves axioms or not? Not quite.
The problem with the translation which preserves all the axioms is that the system
might be too weak to yield an interesting set theory.7 The problem with translations
discussed in paragraphs (i) and (ii) is not merely that the translations of the prob-
lematic axioms fail. It is that the translations fail miserably: in case of (i) by turning
comprehension into something which requires the domain to be a singleton and
in case of (ii) by identifying being the class of b’s with being a b. An interesting
translation would most likely loose some axioms, but would give us some sensible
grounds to do that and would not lead to ridiculous conclusions. Perhaps, there are
such translations into the language of Ontology, but none of the known higher-order
epsilon approaches provides one.
Considerations of this section provide a good argument against Henry’s optimistic
claim about the importance of the higher order epsilon. At least for now the view that
set theory can be interestingly imitated within the language of Ontology is highly
implausible.
7.8 Słupecki’s Generalized Mereology
Słupecki (1958)8 attempted to obtain a sensible set theory within Le´snewskian frame-
work by extending Le´sniewski’s mereology. As he put it:
Generalizing mereology, I keep in mind the following two aims:
(a) in the generalized system the notion of a set should preserve its intuitive sense; in
particular, sets should be deﬁned in a way that treats them as concrete objects.
7 To be fair, details and weaknesses of the translations discussed in paragraph (iii) require further
investigation, which is beyond the scope of this book.
8 The problem with reconstructing Słupecki’s generalized mereology is that the only paper that he
published which pertained to it is a four-page abstract, so quite a few details have to be ﬁlled out
by the reader. What follows is my best shot and understanding what the system looks like.

182
7
Sets Revisited
(b) the generalized system of mereology should be able to underlie mathematics to the
same extent to which simple type theory or axiomatic set theory does. This purpose has
not been attained by Le´sniewski’s own system, in which, for instance, natural number
arithmetic cannot be developed (Słupecki 1958, p. 156).9
Słupecki, instead of Ontology (with name variables a, b, c, . . . uses a language with
individual variables x, y, z, . . . predicate variables f, g, f1, g1, . . . and general func-
tor variables φ, φ1, . . . (whose category is to be contextually salient), and he often
uses formulas with free variables as if the free variables occurring in them were
bound by a universal quantiﬁer standing in the front of the formula. His mereolog-
ical axioms mimic Le´sniewski’s axioms for Mereology. He assumes the reﬂexivity
and transitivity of (improper) parthood relation and assumes extensionality, pretty
much as Le´sniewski’s axioms (a–c) of the 1920 axiomatization of Mereology.10
Słupecki’s axiom 4 states the existence and uniqueness of a fusion of objects satis-
fying a predicate, and it follows from axiom (d) (which states the existence of the
fusion) and other axioms of the 1920 formulation of Mereology.11 Słupecki also
provides certain assumption that go beyond what Le´sniewski has done. His axiom
5 postulates a certain ﬁxed object to go proxy for the empty set,12 and he deﬁnes a
few interesting notions that are supposed to allow us to mimic the language of set
theory.
Słupecki starts with his version of Mereology in a fairly standard higher-order
language. He introduces an additional constant ≤which stands for parthood relation.
Axioms that he introduced more or less mirror Le´sniewski’s axioms:
A.1.
x ≤x
A.2.

10 The background logic is weaker but the properties of the parthood relation are essentially the
same.
11 Basically, the uniqueness follows from extensionality.
12 So Słupecki’s system, unlike Le´sniewski’s, is not free of existential assumptions.

7.8 Słupecki’s Generalized Mereology
183
The category of f is s
n , it is just a predicate of a ﬁrst order language and we read
‘xδf ’ as ‘x fuses f ’. The last axiom states the uniqueness of fusions of nonempty
predicates:
A.4. ∃y f (y) →∃!xxδf
In the language of Le´sniewski’s Mereology the above formulas would have the
following form:
∀a(aεa →aεingr(a))
(7.66)
∀a, b, c(aεingr(b) ∧bεingr(c) →aεingr(c))
(7.67)
∀a, b(aεingr(b) ∧bεingr(a) →(aεb ∧bεa))
(7.68)
∀a, b(aεorl(b) ≡∃c (cεingr(a) ∧cεingr(b)))
(7.69)
∀a, b(aεfus(b) ≡aεa ∧∀c(cεb →c ≤a) ∧∀c(c ≤a →∃d (dεb ∧dεorl(c))))
(7.70)
∀b(∃a aεb →∃c (cεfus(b) ∧∀d(dεfus(b) →dεc)))
(7.71)
From now on I will translate Słupecki’s formulas into the language of Le´sniewski’s
mereology without giving their original form ﬁrst.
The ﬁrst thing that Słupecki wants to account for is the fact that when we speak
of classes in natural language we do seem to refer to the empty set. He introduces
a name constant 0, which he also axiomatically assumes to refer to an object. Thus,
he accepts as an axiom:
∃a 0εa
(7.72)
where ‘0’ is supposed to be “a name of an arbitrary but ﬁxed object” (p. 156). Then,
in his generalized mereology the deﬁnition of a set has the following form (for the
“Słupecki class” I use the symbol CL S, to differentiate it from the Le´sniewski’s
notion of class):
∀a, b(aεCL S(b) ≡(aεfus(b) ∧∃c cεb) ∨(¬∃c cεb ∧aε0))
(7.73)
The basic idea here is that the class of b’s is the fusion of b’s if the name is non–empty
and it is identiﬁed with the selected object 0 otherwise. He also indicates how classes
generated by expressions of various categories can be deﬁned. The class of objects
that correspond to an expression b of category n is just CL S(b). The class generated
by an expression φ of category s
n is deﬁned by:
∀a, φ(aεΔφ ≡aεa ∧∃b (φ(b) ∧aεClS(b)))
(7.74)
Intuitively, for a to be the class of φ, there has to be a possible name b such that
φ(b) holds and a fuses b. ‘Δφ’ names all and only those fusions of b’s for which it

184
7
Sets Revisited
is true that φ(b). For expressions of category s
s
n the deﬁnition is quite similar:
∀a, Φ(aεΔΦ ≡aεa ∧∃φ (Φ(φ) ∧aεClS(Δφ)))
(7.75)
That is, take an s
n -formula φ. If Φ(φ), then all things which are ClS(Δφ)’s are also
among the ΔΦ’s.
Observe that both Δφ and ΔΦ can be plural terms and refer to multiple objects.
For instance, if ‘φ’ stands for ‘is a human being’, then Rafal εΔφ because Rafal ε
Rafal and Rafal ε human being and Rafal ε CL S(Rafal). The same holds for any
particular proper name of a human being, and thus each particular human is denoted
by ‘Δis a human being’.
To obtain a single class, one more application of the CL S operation is needed:
ClS(Δφ) is the class corresponding to φ and ClS(ΔΦ) is the class corresponding
to Φ. (So, for instance, to obtain the class of φ=‘denotes exactly two lizards’, you
ﬁrst take fusions of names which denote exactly two lizards, and then fuse those
fusions into one class.) Deﬁnitions of classes corresponding to expressions of higher
categories are analogous.
Another notion which Słupecki thinks needs redeﬁning is the notion of being an
element of a set. This is because Le´sniewski’s deﬁnition of el eventually identiﬁes
being an element of a set with being its ingredient. In order to introduce a more
ﬁne-grained notion, Słupecki deﬁnes three auxiliary notions.
∀a, b, c(δ1(a, b, c) ≡aεc ∧aεingr(b))
(7.76)
∀a, b, c, φ(δ2(a, b, c, φ) ≡φ(c) ∧aεingr(b))
(7.77)
∀a, b, φ, Φ(δ3(a, b, φ, Φ) ≡Φ(φ) ∧aεingr(b))
(7.78)
To explain the notion of being an element Słupecki introduces the following abbre-
viations (mind that they are not deﬁnitions because they explain the meaning of
∈1, ∈2, ∈3, . . . only in certain contexts).
∀a, b(a ∈1 ClS(b) ≡δ1(a, ClS(b), b))
(7.79)
∀a, φ(ClS(a) ∈2 ClS(Δφ) ≡δ2(ClS(a), ClS(Δφ), a, φ))
(7.80)
∀φ, Φ(ClS(Δφ) ∈3 ClS(ΔΦ) ≡δ3(ClS(Δφ), ClS(ΔΦ), φ, Φ))
(7.81)
So, being an element of CL S(b) an object has to be b and part of CL S(b), for
CL S(a) to be an element of CL S(Δφ), the former has to be a part of the latter and
φ(a) has to hold, and so on…Basically apart form being a part of a class, Słupecki
added an intensional element of satisfying a certain condition used in the construction
of this class.

7.8 Słupecki’s Generalized Mereology
185
Now, Słupecki in order to obtain a “copy” of the language of set theory invites us
to take all theorems of his mereology and throw out all the theorems which are not
constructed from:
a ∈1 ClS(b), ClS(a) ∈2 ClS(φ), ClS(Δφ) ∈ClS(ΔΦ), . . .
(7.82)
together with propositional connectives and quantiﬁers. The intersection of the set of
theorems of his mereology with this language is dubbed ‘system M of generalized
mereology’.13
Now, things get a bit more hasty in Słupecki. From among theorems of Ontology
he distinguishes theorems constructed from:
aεb, φ(a), Φ(φ), . . .
(7.83)
together with propositional connectives and quantiﬁers. The system thus separated
is called S1.
Now, he claims that there is a a mapping from the language of M onto the language
of S1. Every formula of the form of the n-th element of the sequence in (7.83) is
assigned to a formula of the form of the n-th element of the sequence in (7.82). So,
a ∈1 CL S(b) is mapped to aεb, CL S(a) ∈2 CL S(φ) is mapped to φ(a), and so on.
If α1 and β1 are assigned to α and β, f1 is a one-place sentential connective, f2 is a
two-place sentential connective, then assign: f1α1 to f1α, α1 f2β2 to αf2β, ∃τ α1 to
∃τ α and ∀τα1 to ∀τα.
The following are theorems of Słupecki’s mereology (before the language is
restricted):
∀a, b(a ∈1 ClS(b) ≡aεb)
(7.84)
∀a, φ(ClS(a) ∈2 ClS(Δφ) ≡φ(a))
(7.85)
∀φ, Φ(ClS(Δφ) ∈3 ClS(ΔΦ) ≡Φ(φ))
(7.86)
andsoon.HencethemappingbetweenS1 and Mestablishesanisomorphismbetween
the theories. Since S1 in quite an obvious manner corresponds to the language of
simple type theory, Słupecki’s comment is:
It follows that system M, and even more the whole system of generalized mereology sufﬁces
as a system of foundations of mathematics, because—as it is well-known—S1 sufﬁces for
that purpose. This conclusion may seem trivial because the full system of simple type theory
without any additions can constitute a foundation of mathematics. However, in my paper I
give arguments (I realize that those arguments are not wholly convincing and for that reason
I do not repeat them here) indicating that constants belonging to semantics categories to
13 It is a fairly awkward procedure, for the axioms of the theory no longer are theorems of system
M, but the set of theorems of M is nevertheless well deﬁned. Perhaps, there is an axiomatization
of M in the language of M. This, however, lies beyond the scope of present considerations (in
particular, because I think that as a replacement for set theory M is ﬂawed anyway). This does not
mean that the system is not interesting in itself.

186

Sets Revisited
which variables f, φ, Φ, . . . belong are not names of sets or any other objects, but rather
expressions devoid of independent reference. Those terms cannot denote concrete objects,
so the full system of simple type theory does not fulﬁll aim (a), which was mentioned above
(p. 158).14
7.9 Challenges to Słupecki’s Account
Słupecki’s proposal meets several challenges. Notice ﬁrst that introducing (7.72)—
an arbitrary object to go proxy for the empty set—is a rather unintuitive technical
trick. The theory ceases to be ontologically neutral. Also, philosophically speaking,
there seems to be no particular object which we could pick out and determine to
do the job of the empty set. On Le´sniewski’s view, technical niceties that this move
provides do not constitute a reason for departing from our intuitions about the empty
set. And one of the main intuitions is that if we think of sets mereologically there is no
reason to say that there is an empty set (and if we do not think of sets mereologically,
it seems clear that the empty set is not just an arbitrarily picked and ﬁxed concrete
object).
But there is a more severe problem with Lsłupecki’s account of the empty set.
Consider constant ‘0’ as introduced by axiom (7.72). The following is a theorem of
Ontology:
∀a[0εa →0εf us(0) ∧∃c cε0]
(0 itself being a witness for the existential claim). This means, by deﬁnition 7.73,
that 0εCL S(0). Also, it follows that 0ε0 ∧0εingr(CL S(0)) and thus:
δ1(0, CL S(0), 0)
This, by deﬁnition (7.79) means 0 ∈1 CL S(0). But given that CL S(0) simply is 0,
this means 0 ∈1 0, which is a disturbing consequence given that 0 was supposed to
be empty.
Another problem stems from the fact that Słupecki deﬁnes classes in mereolog-
ical terms and elementhood in terms of satisfying certain conditions. This leads to
situations in which one and the same class might be determined by non-equivalent
conditions and thus have different members. Let us see an example of this. Deﬁne:

7.9 Challenges to Słupecki’s Account
187
∀a (φ′(a) ≡a ε a ∧(a ε a ∨¬a ε a))
(7.87)
∀a (φ′′(a) ≡(a ε a ∨¬a ε a))
(7.88)
The claim is:
Theorem 7.7 ClS(Δφ′) is the same object as ClS(Δφ′′).
Proof
Indeed:
∀a[aεΔφ′ ≡(aεa ∧∃b (φ′(b) ∧aεClS(b)))]
That is,
∀a[aεΔφ′ ≡(aεa ∧∃b ((bεb ∧(bεb ∨¬bεb) ∧aεClS(b))))]
∀a[aεΔφ′ ≡(aεa ∧∃b (bεb ∧aεClS(b)))]
But if aεa then also aεClS(a). Hence:
∀a[aεΔφ′ ≡aεa]
(7.89)
Also,
∀a[aεΔφ′′ ≡(aεa ∧∃b (φ′′(b) ∧aεClS(b)))]]
∀a[aεΔφ′′ ≡(aεa ∧∃b ((bεb ∨¬bεb) ∧aεClS(b)))]]
∀a[aεΔφ′′ ≡(aεa ∧∃b (aεClS(b)))]]
But since if aεa then aεClS(a), it also follows that if aεa then ∃b (aεClS(b)).
Therefore:
∀a[aεΔφ′′ ≡aεa]
(7.90)
But this is problematic. (7.85) together with (7.87) imply that:
∀a(ClS(a) ∈2 ClS(Δφ′) ≡φ′(a) ≡aεa)
and together with (7.88) it implies that:
∀a(Cls(a) ∈2 ClS(Δφ′′) ≡φ′′(a) ≡aεa ∨¬aεa)
It seems that at least certain instances of the indiscernibility of identicals have to be
rejected if Słupecki’s theory is to be maintained. In this case, we should reject:

188
7
Sets Revisited
∀a, φ, ψ[ClS(Δφ) = ClS(Δψ) →(ClS(a) ∈2 ClS(Δφ) ≡ClS(a) ∈2 ClS(Δψ))]
(7.91)
Otherwise, the theory would imply that ∀aaεa, which contradicts an already provable
theorem of Ontology.
Therefore it seems Słupecki’s generalized mereology has certain ﬂaws that pre-
clude it from being a good candidate for a nominalist replacement for the language
of any mainstream (and extensional) set theory. Even if the theory was devoid of
oddities of the kind mentioned above, it still would not be obvious that it follows the
Le´sniewskian agenda and satisﬁes Słupecki’s requirements.
It is also not clear whether isomorphism with type theory is enough. When moti-
vating his work, Słupecki insists that Ontology is not sufﬁcient because there is
no arithmetic within it (presumably because the axiom of inﬁnity is missing, but
Słupecki does not specify). After a while, Słupecki claims his system does the job
because it is isomorphic with a subsystem of Ontology. How can one reasonably
hold both claims, is not clear. Also, if a subsystem of Ontology is good enough, it is
not clear why anything else is needed on top of it.
Suppose Słupecki has a way around these philosophical qualms. Another worry
remains. Słupecki insisted that the system should be nominalistically acceptable,
but he uses higher-order quantiﬁcation in his system, and whether this device is
nominalistically acceptable is far from obvious. In fact, the next chapter is devoted
to this question.

Nominalism and Higher-Order Quantiﬁcation
Abstract Le´sniewski’s main motivations were nominalistic. Yet, it is unclear
whether quantiﬁers in his systems commit one to the existence of sets, because he
described them only proof-theoretically and they seem to behave like higher-order
quantiﬁers. I ﬁrst (tentatively) argue that Ontology is committed to sets. The key
assumption in the argument is that the logic obtained with the substitutional seman-
tics lacks certain desired features which the logic with set-theoretic semantics has. I
describe two known attempts to provide Ontology with a nominalistically acceptable
semantics (Simons, Rickey). I ﬁnd both these attempts lacking, even though the basic
intuitions behind them are quite compelling. I employ those intuitions to develop a
more satisfactory semantics, show how the tentative critical argument fails from this
perspective and defend the philosophical viability of this approach.
8.1 Introductory Remarks
Le´sniewski was a nominalist and he developed Protothetic, Ontology and Mereology
inhisattempttoprovidenominalisticallyacceptablefoundationsofmathematics.Yet,
a philosophical question arises, even prior to the question whether the systems can
emulateinterestingmathematicaltheories.Isthelogicalpartofthetheory(Protothetic
and Ontology) ontologically innocent and nominalistically acceptable?
In particular, it is not clear whether a nominalist can use Le´sniewski’s
quantiﬁcation, especially in Ontology. What, for instance, do name variables in
Ontology range over? Le´sniewski himself did not provide any intuitive explana-
tion of his quantiﬁers and the ﬁrst stab might be that it is subsets of the domain of
individuals that have to be values of bound variables of this sort. If this really is the
case, anyone who uses the system will fail in providing a nominalistic reconstruction
of mathematics.
I’ll start with a few remarks about the notion of ontological commitment. Then
I’ll introduce a system dubbed Quantiﬁed naming logic. I will then present an
argument to the effect that this system requires set-theoretic semantics and is

Nominalism and Higher-Order Quantiﬁcation
therefore committed to the existence of sets. Next, I will discuss a potential
response to this worry,which instead of set-theoretic semantics employs substitu-
tional approach to higher-order quantiﬁers. The main problem with this approach
seems to be that a nominalist will run out of substitution instances to emulate stan-
dard quantiﬁcation over an inﬁnite domain. As another alternative to set-theoretic
semantics, we’ll look at Simon’s combinatorial semantics. While philosophically
compelling, it is technically underdeveloped and for this reason cannot constitute
the whole story. Then, I will look at yet another approach, Rickey’s natural models
and point out its weak spots. Finally, I will try to make a small step forward and
introduce relational semantics for plural quantiﬁcation, arguing for its philosophical
plausibility. I will end with a brief list of issues that need to be addressed.
Before we turn to the question whether we are ontologically committed to sets
when we use a certain type of quantiﬁcation, a few words of explanation regarding
the notion of ontological commitment (of logical theories) are due. I take (inter-
preted) theories to be the primary bearers of ontological commitment. People become
ontologically committed when they accept ontologically committed theories.
Quine’s way of reading off the ontological commitment of a theory, in the stronger
reading, consists in the conjunction of two claims: (i) each such theory should be
ﬁrst translated into a regimented, ﬁrst-order and extensional language, and (ii) the
initially considered theory is committed to the existence of those things that have to
belong to the range of ﬁrst-order quantiﬁers of the regimented version thus obtained.1
I tend to disagree with Quine.2 Even putting (i) above aside, I do not think that
there is a “criterion” of ontological commitment that both analyzes our intuitions
about ontological commitment correctly and is epistemically more tractable than the
notion of ontological commitment itself. It does not seem that our understanding of
the relation ‘x has to be in the range of the ﬁrst-order version of a theory T for T to
be true’ is any clearer that our notion of ontological commitment itself. One of the
worries is, for instance, that many theories formulated in natural language, even if
they have a ﬁrst-order version,3 do not have a unique ﬁrst-order version, and those
non-unique versions differ on what has to lie in their range of quantiﬁcation in order
for them to be true.4
Even though we cannot always read off our ontological commitment from the
way we ordinarily talk (if I do something for the sake of convenience, am I really
committed to an object which is the sake of convenience?), when we proceed with
a ﬁrst-orderization of our theories our regimentation can be guided by some prior
metaphysical conceptions that we are inclined to end up with anyway: and depend-
ing on what restrictions we put on our procedure we might end up with different
ontologies produced by the commitment of our ﬁrst-order quantiﬁers. Agreement
1 The weaker reading requires only that the language be ﬁrst-order, without requiring that it be the
extensional language familiar from ﬁrst-order classical logic.
2 I mostly agree with the criticism of this sort of approach to be found in Chihara (1973, 1990).
3 The notion of being a ﬁrst-order version is also not very clear, but let us not worry about that and
just assume that what matters is agreement on theorems modulo some ﬁxed translation.
4 These and related issues lie beyond the scope of my present considerations, though.

8.1 Introductory Remarks
191
on theorems (modulo translation) is not enough to ensure the uniqueness of our
underlying ontology.5
This, however, does not mean that I should not say a few words to elucidate
what it means for a logic to carry ontological commitment to sets. I take it to
mean that even if someone’s prior overall beliefs did not commit one to sets, one
becomes committed to sets when one accepts a given logic as a reasonable tool
for one’s practical and theoretical purposes. For now, let me adopt the following
rough–and–ready requirement: a logic is committed to sets if (not necessarily iff) its
(preferred) semantics6 requires that certain variables of its language range over sets
(or that certain constants of its language name sets) for the theorems of this logic to
be valid. If an equally successful explanation can be given which does not require the
existence of sets I will say that the logic (with this new semantics) does not commit
one to sets.
8.2 Quantiﬁed Naming Logic
In this chapter I will be concerned only with a subsystem of Ontology (it can be
thought of as a variant of the logic of plurals), dubbed Quantiﬁed Name Logic
(QNL). One of the reasons why plural quantiﬁcation is worth bringing up in this
context is that by the time the logic of plurals came to attention, a debate about the
ontological commitment of plural quantiﬁcation has already taken place, dressed up
as a debate about interpreting Le´sniewskian quantiﬁers. The logic in question will be
the consequence operation that the language of QNL yields when given set-theoretic
semantics (details will follow).7
In QNL, name variables are the only admissible kind of variables and the only
quantiﬁers are those that bind name variables. Well-formed formulas are constructed
from name variables a1, a2, a3, . . . ∈Var, Boolean connectives ¬, ∧, a sentential
functor of two name arguments ε (read as ‘is one of’ or simply ‘is’), and the existential
quantiﬁer ∃according to the following rules:
(i) If α1, α2 ∈Var, then α1 ε α2 is a well-formed formula.
(ii) If φ1, φ2 are wff‘s and α ∈Var, then ¬(φ1), (φ1) ∧(φ2) and ∃α (φ1) are wff’s.
(iii) Nothing else is a wff.
Recall that intuitively name variables behave like place-holders for countable
name phrases (henceforth called names), no matter whether those are empty, singular
orrefertomultipleobjects.Underaninterpretation‘a ε b’istrueiffa “names”exactly
one object and this object is also “named” by b (b may “name” other objects as well,
but it does not have to). Some examples of QNL renderings of natural language
sentences are:
5 This point shines also through some of Smith’s remarks (2009) about Parsons (2008).
6 And I take a logic to be given together with a semantics, more remarks on this issue will follow.
7 Sometimes, I will use ‘QNL’ and ‘the logic of plurals’ interchangeably, trusting this will not cause
any confusion.

As a nominalist, Le´sniewski intended to develop his systems in a nominalistically
acceptable way. This is why, for instance, he meticulously built his inscriptional
syntax to ensure it does not bear commitment to expression types. Alas, he did not
elaborate on the semantics of Ontology. He simply treated quantiﬁcation in Ontology
as primitive.
As the notion of formal semantics ﬁrmly established its position in the minds of
mid-twentieth century logicians, this became philosophically suspicious. A question
arose as to how we are to make sense (nominalistically) of Le´sniewski’s quantiﬁ-
cation.8 Before looking at various attempts of dealing with this issue, let us take a
look at the reason why one might ﬁnd higher-order quantiﬁcation nominalistically
problematic.
Main semantics for plural quantiﬁcation are either set-theoretic or substitutional.
One of the main argument for the claim that plural quantiﬁcation commits one to sets
relies on rejecting the latter. Once one is left with the former, sets are in the range of
quantiﬁcation, and thus one is committed to them when using the system. To look at
this argument, let’s review these semantics brieﬂy.
A set-theoretic QNL-model is a structure ⟨D, Iset⟩where D is a non-empty
domain of objects and Iset maps Var into the powerset of D. A substitutional
QNL-model is a structure ⟨N, Isub, Val⟩where N ̸= ∅is a set of name substituends,
Isub maps Var into N, and Val maps the set of pairs {⟨x, y⟩| x, y ∈N} into {1, 0}.
Under the substitutional interpretation the truth of substitution instances of atomic
formulas is taken to be primitive and Val is a function that assigns truth values to
such instances. Pure substitutional interpretation explicitly refuses to provide further
analysis of truth-conditions of substitution instances of atomic formulas, especially
in terms of the reference of their constituents. As for satisfaction, I skip the clauses for
Boolean connectives and describe how it works for atomic and quantiﬁed formulas:
⟨D, Iset⟩|=set α ε β iff | Iset(α) |= 1, and Iset(α) ⊆Iset(β).
⟨D, Iset⟩|=set ∃α φ iff ⟨D, I α
set⟩|=set φ,
for some I α
set which differs from Iset at most at α.
⟨N, Isub, V al⟩|=sub α ε β iff Val(Isub(α), Isub(β)) = 1.
⟨N, Isub, V al⟩|=sub ∃α φ iff ⟨N, I α
sub, V al⟩|=sub φ,
for some I α
sub which differs from Isub at most at α.

8.2 Quantiﬁed Naming Logic
193
That is, set-theoretic semantics takes name variables to range over subsets of the
domain, whereas the substitutional semantics takes an existentially quantiﬁed state-
ment to be satisﬁed if one of its instances (with respect to the variable involved) is
satisﬁed.9, 10
8.3 The Received View
What I call the received view (motivated by certain remarks by Quine, Gödel or
Skolem) is the view that any logic that uses higher-order quantiﬁcation comparable
to at least monadic second-order logic is committed to the existence of sets. One
of the reasons why one might think that plural quantiﬁcation bears commitment to
abstract objects is the belief that plural quantiﬁers have to range over sets, possibly
because another alternative, the substitutional reading of plural quantiﬁers is not
satisfactory. One could imagine someone arguing as follows.
[SA1] Whenever we present a logical system (involving quantiﬁcation) we have
to provide it with a formal semantics which we think captures the meaning
of these quantiﬁers adequately.
[SA2] If we use a certain logical system and believe that a certain semantics is
an adequate semantics of this language, we are committed to whatever lies
in the range(s) of quantiﬁcation of some type of variables of the object
language according to this semantics.
9 It may seem that additional requirements should be put on Val so that certain formulas come out
valid. For instance ∀a, b, c (a ε b ∧b ε c →a ε c) is set-theoretically valid, but not substitutionally
valid. (Take the interpretation where N = {1, 2, 3}, Val(1, 2) = Val(2, 3) = 1 but V al(1, 3) = 0,
and I (a) = 1, I (b) = 2, I (c) = 3.) Actually, the point of the substitutional interpretation was to
allow for disagreements of this sort (Dunn and Belnap 1968). For our present concerns, these issues
aren’t important.
10 It is worth remarking that providing QNL with a set-theoretic semantics (arguably) deprives them
of the expressive power that it has been argued the natural language plural quantiﬁcation has. A
classical argument is this. The following is intuitively true:
(8.1) There are some objects such that all and only those objects that are sets and not elements
of themselves are among them.
The following, however, cannot be the case (the sentence states the existence of Russell’s set):
(8.2) There is a set of objects such that all and only those objects that are sets and not
elements of themselves are elements of it.
(8.1) seems to state the existence of a certain plurality (the plurality of those objects that are
sets and not elements of themselves). So, prima facie, there are pluralities which are not sets.
Hence, quantiﬁcation over pluralities cannot be fully captured by interpretation which reads it as
quantiﬁcation over sets (or subsets of a domain).
For now, without any attempt to explain the use of plurals which does not seem to be captured
by the set-theoretic semantics I will just remark that the expressivity provided by the set-theoretic
semantics is complex enough to raise problems that will be my main concern.

Nominalism and Higher-Order Quantiﬁcation
[SA3] The logic of plurals can have two kinds of semantics: a set-theoretic seman-
tics (discussed before) or a substitutional semantics.11
[SA4] QNL with nominalistically acceptable substitutional semantics is not the-
oretically satisfactory.
[SA5] Therefore it has to be given a set-theoretic semantics.
[SA6] Butontheset-theoreticreadingofpluralquantiﬁers,theyrangeoversubsets
of a domain.
[SA7] Subsets of a domain are abstract objects and hence whenever we use the
logic of plurals we are committed to abstract objects.
Let us dub arguments that go along these lines semantic arguments for the claim
that higher-order quantiﬁcation commits one to abstract objects.12
11 For instance(Kearns 1969,165–166) says:
I feel that one can distinguish two fundamentally different ways of regarding variables– I will
call these two views of variables. The ﬁrst view I call the Russell–Quine view; the second is
the Frege–Le´sniewski view (these will be abbreviated as R–Q and F–L, respectively). These
two are not the only possible views, but I feel that they are the two basic views; other views
will be variants of one or the other, or perhaps combinations of the two…The R–Q view of
variables could be called the pronoun view of variables. Professor Quine has compared the
use of variables with many uses of pronouns in English; however, he views pronouns as more
fundamental than nouns…On the R–Q view, quantiﬁers are used to talk about all entities
or some entity…On the F–L view, a variable is seen as a replacement for an expressions.
Variables do not have ranges of values, where each value is an entity of some kind.
I am not convinced that Kearns is exactly right crediting the substitutional reading to Le´sniewski;
it seems that his interpretation relies on a mistranslation. Le´sniewski in the passage Kearns refers
to explains how he used quantiﬁers when he “did not yet know how to operate with quantiﬁers.”
It is therefore not sure whether this is how he understood his formal quantiﬁers once he had them.
Also, he wrote “przy pewnym znaczeniu wyrazu”, which translates as “for some meaning of the
expression” or “for some meaning of the word” (Le´sniewski 1927, 203). Kearns translates the phrase
as “for some signiﬁcant words” (which would be “dla pewnego wyrazu posiadajacego znaczenie”
or “dla pewnego znaczacego wyrazu” in Polish) and takes it to be Le´sniewski’s explanation of his
quantiﬁers. But let’s put these qualms aside.
12 I have not encountered an argument formulated exactly this way, but it seems that the tendency
can be traced back at least to Quine. In 1947 he remarks that any usage of general terms in the
context of quantiﬁcation commits one to abstract objects (pp. 74–75), and he explicitly says about
quantiﬁers binding predicate letters:
If we bind the schematic predicate–letters of quantiﬁcation theory, we achieve a reiﬁcation
of universals which no device analogous to Fitch’s is adequate to explaining away. These
universals are entities whereof predicates may thenceforward be regarded as names; they
may be construed as attributes or as classes …The predicate letters, when thus admitted to
quantiﬁers, acquire the status of variables taking classes as values (pp. 77–78).
He is even more explicit when he discusses Le´sniewski’s Ontology (Quine 1952, 141). There,
he criticizes Ajdukiewicz and Le´sniewski for not attaching sufﬁcient signiﬁcance to the fact that
“the variables which have been said to stand in places appropriate to general terms are subjected
in Le´sniewski’s theory to quantiﬁcation.” This theory, according to Quine, “…surely commits
Le´sniewski to a realm of values of his variables of quantiﬁcation; and all his would-be general
terms must be viewed as naming these values singly.” Quite rhetorically Quine claims that if this
quantiﬁcation is not to be read as committing Le´sniewski to classes, then he is “at a loss to imagine

8.3 The Received View
195
For the sake of argument I will grant [SA1-2]. I will, however, later take an issue
with [SA4], and by dealing with it, also with [SA3].
Why exactly should we accept [SA4]? When it comes to problems with the
nominalistic acceptability of the substitutional interpretation of Le´sniewski’s quanti-
ﬁers, Küng and Canty (1970) is a classic.13 The authors go through a certain variety
of approaches to the problem and there are some bells and whistles that we will
soon look into. The main gist, however, is that no matter whether we think of names
we can substitute as existing inscriptions, or whether we think of them as possible
terms that can be introduced by means of a deﬁnition, there can be at most countably
many of those. In the ﬁrst case, because they would be ﬁnite sequences over a ﬁnite
alphabet (this is how a nominalist should think of names, arguably). In the second
case, because deﬁnitions are ﬁnite sequences over a ﬁnite alphabet. This leads to a
problem when we want to emulate set-theoretic second-order quantiﬁcation over an
inﬁnite domain, for there are uncountably many subsets of each such domain, and
thus we will run out of names supposed to go proxy for subsets. This indicates that it
will be hard to run certain mathematical theories. For instance, it will be very hard to
mimic the quantiﬁcation over real numbers using this sort of substitutional reading.
Also, even if the domain of objects is denumerable, the substitutional interpretation
will give us a different result than the set-theoretic one, because there will be more
subsets of the domain than possible names.
Let us call the arguments against any substitutional interpretation of higher-order
(or plural) quantiﬁcation which in one way or another relies on the claim that since
(Footnote 12 continued)
wherein such commitment even on the part of a professing Platonist can consist”. Quine’s argument
is, however, slightly different from the one I gave. He is already assuming that being subjected to
quantiﬁcation automatically carries ontological commitment, and instead of explicitly discussing
the need for semantics and how what semantics we choose can impact our ontological commitment
he insists that sentences should be put in their standard ﬁrst-order form. Quine (1970, 66–67)
contains yet another argument. In ordinary ﬁrst-order quantiﬁcations (like the one expressed by
‘(∃x)(x walks)’) the open sentence displays a variable in a position where a name could stand. The
quantiﬁed sentences are not read as quantifying over names: they rather quantify over objects that
could be named by a name placed in the position of a variable. Similarly when we bind predicate
variables, we “treat predicate positions suddenly as name positions, and hence …treat predicates as
names of entities of some sort.” This argument has been dealt with by Boolos (1998b, 37–39), who
points out that to put a predicate variable in a quantiﬁer may require that the variable be treated as
having a range but we do not have to treat predicate positions as name positions just because we do
so for ordinary individual variables.
A train of thought which more explicitly relies on the relevance of the choice of a semantics can
be found in Burgess (2004, 217):
…if a model theory has not yet been developed of a given logical notion, it may be alleged
that the notion is ‘meaningless’ because it lacks a ‘semantics’. On the other hand, once a
model theory has been developed for a given logical notion it may be alleged that problematic
‘ontological commitments’ are implicit in the use of the notion…
13 The authors argue that Ontology cannot be given substitutional semantics, and since they focus
on the part of Le´sniewski’s Ontology which resembles QNL (i.e. they discuss quantiﬁcation over
name variables only), their arguments, if compelling, mutatis mutandi apply here.

Nominalism and Higher-Order Quantiﬁcation
the class of substituents is at most countable (and this constitutes a problem because
we do not have any upper limit on the size of the domain of objects to be named)
size limitation objections.
[SA4] is motivated by the size limitation objection and relies on the claim that
every nominalistically acceptable approach to substitutional semantics for QNL puts
the countability requirement on the set of names that can be substituted. In what fol-
lows, however, I will argue that there is a way of circumventing the intuitions under-
lying [SA4]. I will develop a modal-substitutional semantics for plural quantiﬁcation
to argue that the disjunction in [SA3] is not as exhaustive as it may initially seem.
8.4 Challenges to the Substitutional Reading
Küng and Canty (1970) argue that Ontology cannot be given substitutional semantics
by discussing some substitutional interpretations which they ﬁnd initially plausible
and reject them one by one. Here is how they proceed.
Actual inscriptions
Suppose the quantiﬁcation ranges over actual inscriptions. For instance:
∀a, b (a ε b →∃c c ε a)
(8.3)
on this interpretation reads:
Reading 1 For any two name inscriptions a, b, if a sentence inscription in which a
is subject and b predicate is true, then there is some name inscription c,
contained in a true sentence in which c is the subject and a name equiform
to a is the predicate.
Note that some sort of equiformity relation between inscriptions is necessary here.
This point might be made clearer when we notice that ∀a (a ε a ∨¬a ε a) should
come out substitutionally valid. If every occurrence of a in the formula was to stand
for one and the same inscription the sentence would be true under no substitution,
for no single token can occur at more than one place.14
It also seems that the way the authors read the formula is still unsuccessful. For
say a name a does not occur in any sentence. Then, there is no such a thing as the
sentence in which a is a subject. “Stand-alone” names would lie outside the range
of quantiﬁcation on this reading. Perhaps this can be ﬁxed by the following reading:
14 We have to be aware of the usual qualms about equiformity (the authors do not deﬁne the notion
and take it to be primitive). If the quantiﬁed variables range over equiform names indistinctively, the
language cannot contain equiform names which differ in their reference (which means that natural
languages are not good candidates). To avoid this, one would have to construct a more ﬁne-grained
relation of equiformity, where only those “geometrically equiform” names which have the same
“lexical entries” can be really equiform. But this would indicate that the notion of equiformity has
some semantical component. Let’s not dwell on this now, suppose that we have answered the qualms
about equiformity. Then, still, as the authors claim, we run into troubles.

8.4 Challenges to the Substitutional Reading
197
Reading 2 For any two name inscriptions a and b, if a sentence inscription a1 ε b1
is true and a1 is equiform to a and b1 is equiform to b, then there is
a name inscription c such that there is a true sentence c ε a2 and a2 is
equiform to a.
This is still not exactly right. The fact that a certain sentence inscription logi-
cally implies another sentence inscription is made contingent on the existence of yet
another sentence: the entailment between a ε b and ∃c c ε a is made contingent upon
the existence of a certain c ε a2. Rather, the intuition is that, for instance, ‘Russell ε
philosopher’ entails ‘∃c c ε Russell’, no matter whether there actually exists a true
sentence which would result from ‘c ε Russell’ by substituting a name for c.
A modiﬁcation of reading 2 would not require the existence of sentences. It would
beenoughthatnameinscriptionsexistandrefer.Forinstance,(8.3)wouldberendered
as:
Reading 3 For any name inscriptions a and b, if a refers to a unique object which
is among the objects to which b refers, then there is an actual name
inscription c such that it refers to a unique object which is one of the
objects to which a refers.
On this reading, the formula would be valid (because the existence claim in the
consequent is warranted by the existence of a itself). This builds semantics into the
picture and ﬁxes some of the difﬁculties discussed above.
Still, the problem is that any theory which requires that the domain be at least
denumerable (like Peano arithmetic, for instance) will fail to be modeled on this
reading since the number of existing inscriptions is very likely ﬁnite. Since a very
important theoretical purpose of logical systems like Ontology (or systems based on
the logic of plurals) is to develop a formalization of mathematical discourse, if we
give QNL a substitutional semantics of this sort it will fall short of providing us with
the needed framework.
Logically possible inscriptions
Having abandoned the actualist substitutional reading Küng and Canty (1970) then
consider the idea that Le´sniewskian quantiﬁers range over “logically possible inscrip-
tions” (p. 174).
On this reading, an existentially quantiﬁed statement would be satisﬁed iff there
were a logically possible inscription which would satisfy the requirements put on it
by the content of the formula. As they quite correctly notice, there is a problem with
explicating the notion of logically possible inscriptions. They make a valid negative
point that logical possibility should not be identiﬁed with physical possibility.15 As
for the positive part, they focus ﬁrst on the reading on which logically possible names
15 In a way, Le´sniewski’s metalogic seems to require a modal approach as well. Kearns (1962,
11) says about Le´sniewski’s terminological explanations (which I comment on in sect. 6.4): ‘The
T.E.s are like blueprints—they present the rules for as many systems as one cares to construct. For
Lesniewski, a formal system exists in space and time, and it contains just those results which have
actually been deduced. This means that there are no unproved theorems of a formal system. However,
such a claim does not make proofs of completeness and consistency either trivial or senseless. For

Nominalism and Higher-Order Quantiﬁcation
are those that either actually exist or can be introduced according to the Le´sniewskian
rule of deﬁnition.16 The authors, however, do not ﬁnd this initially plausible reading
very satisfactory:
But in ontology proper only two name constants are deﬁnable, the empty name and the uni-
versal name, just as in Boolean algebra only two non-equivalent constants are distinguishable
(p. 177).
Depending on how one distinguishes name constants, the claim may be true or false.
Ononereading, thereareonlytwoconstants deﬁnable(supposewereasonablyextend
S-semantics to allow constants to denote) if in any S-model any deﬁnable constant
will denote one of certain two subsets of the domain, given that no constants can be
taken as primitive. For instance, if in any model any deﬁned constant will denote the
empty set or the whole domain of the model, we can (in the sense just speciﬁed) say
that at most two constants are deﬁnable. In this sense, the above claim is true.
On the other hand, if what we mean by ‘different constants’ is ‘constants which
are not logically equivalent’, that is, constants such that there is a model where they
denote different subsets of the domain, there are more than two constants. It is the
second meaning of ‘difference between constants’ that led Rickey (1985, 186) to
criticize Küng and Canty (1970). Let us take a look at his argument.
He suggests that there are other, non-equivalent constants that can be deﬁned in
Ontology (which are also deﬁnable in QNL). His example is:
∀a (a ε 2+ ≡a ε a ∧∃b, c (a ε b ∧a ε c ∧¬ b ◦c))
(8.4)
where b◦c stands for ∀d (d ε b ≡d ε c). Further, he claims the following. In a model
which contains exactly three objects (say, 1, 2, 3) where b refers to two objects: 1
and 2, and c refers to two objects: 2 and 3, 2+ is a constant different from both the
empty and the full name, because it denotes only one object, 2.
The initial worry about the fact that only  and V are deﬁnable was that on this
sort of substitutional reading the satisfaction of complex formulas will depend only
on what is true or false about the empty set or about the whole domain, that is,
these must be understood as proofs about all possible well-formed formulas or theorems, rather than
(Footnote 15 continued)
as about some ideal individuals. The problem of potentiality, or possibility, is a different problem
from that relating to abstract entities. Potential objects and events are quite as individual as actual
ones. To say that every well-formed formula which can be constructed will either be provable or
contradictory is not to say anything which commits one to recognizing the formal system containing
the theorems.’ [the emphasis is Kearns’s]
16 In QNL we could introduce a rule of deﬁnition in the following form. First we extend the alphabet
by a denumerable number of name constants δ1, δ2, . . . and modify the syntax accordingly. Next,
we enumerate all QNL formulas which do not contain name constants and contain exactly one free
variable: φ1, φ2, . . .. Then we introduce as axioms all formulas of the form:
∀a [a ε δi ≡a ε a ∧φi(a)]
and in any model we take δi to denote the set of all and only those objects whose singular names
would satisfy φi.

8.4 Challenges to the Substitutional Reading
199
only the empty set or the whole domain would, in a sense, lie in the range of name
variables (in a sense, this is the semantical version of the claim that there are not
enough constants). The question is: do constants introduced according to Rickey’s
recipe (2+, 3+, 4+, etc.) ﬁx the problem?
One worry is that Rickey in his claim already assumes he understands quantiﬁca-
tion and knows that b or c are legitimate subsitutends. But the approach is only about
to provide constants! Let us put this worry aside, what objects exactly fall under 2+
in Rickey’s three-element model?
In a purely substitutional interpretation it is somewhat hard to decide what this
question means,17 but a plausible shot might be this. An object x from the model
described by Rickey falls under 2+ in that model if and only if, if we introduce a
singular term a denoting x, then the description of the model makes a ε 2+ true.
So say we start with a language with three singular terms: ‘1’, ‘2’ and ‘3’ denoting
objects 1, 2 and 3 respectively, and suppose we have constants b and c with reference
as speciﬁed above. Take 1. Certainly 1 ε 1. Also, 1 ε b and 1 ε V . Thus ∃b, c (a ε b ∧
a ε c ∧¬ b ◦c). Hence 1 ε 2+. Similar arguments work for 2 and 3. Thus, in Rickey’s
model 2+ has the same denotation as V . In general, any constant of the kind described
by Rickey of the form n+ (where is a natural number) will denote the same as V in
any model which has at least n elements and the same as  in any model which has
less than n elements. Extending the language with logically non-equivalent constants
deﬁned in accordance with Rickey’s recipe does not provide us with a way out.
Küng and Canty propose a yet wider notion of logical possibility of constants.
First,theyremarkthateventhoughcertainconstantscannotbedeﬁnedinthelanguage
of Ontology, they can be introduced axiomatically.
…new constants can be added to Ontology not only by means of deﬁnitions, but also by
means of new axioms (Küng and Canty 1970, 177)
This of course is a little bit tricky, because it is not obvious what conditions have to be
put on an axiomatic system in order for it to really introduce a new constant. If what
one cares about is only that introduction of new constants preserves consistency it is
enough to add axioms saying that a new constant is not coextensive with any other
constant. If, on the other hand, one believes that a new constant is really introduced
if the axioms together with rules of inference determine the semantical interpretation
of the new expression, things can get fairly complex.
Fortunately we will not have to get into this issue too far, because, arguably,
no matter how exactly axioms will introduce new constants, we still will run out
of constants. We may safely assume that any constant would be introduced my
means of a single formula or a single axiom schema (say, the conjunction of those
axioms and/or axiom schemas which would introduce it). But this implies there are
at most denumerably many formulas (or schemas) that introduce a new constant.
17 The problem here is that on the classical reading “substitutional quantiﬁcation is not grounded
in assignments of objects at all” (Marcus 1972, 248). Rickey, on the other hand, quite interestingly,
wants to have his pie and eat it: to interpret quantiﬁcation substitutionally but assign denotation to
substituents. It is not impossible (in fact, I will be trying to do something similar), but this makes
the semantics far from being purely substitutional.

Nominalism and Higher-Order Quantiﬁcation
This indicates that it will be hard to run certain mathematical theories. For instance,
it will be very hard to mimic the quantiﬁcation over real numbers using this sort
of substitutional reading. Also, even if the domain of objects is denumerable, the
substitutional interpretation will give us a different result than the set-theoretic one,
because there will be more subsets of the domain than possible names.
Here, Küng and Canty end the list of what they consider acceptable approaches
to the substitutional quantiﬁcation18 and go on to suggest that…
one must further consider the set of all subsets of that domain. Here, one assigns to each
constant from the category of names some element from this set: call it the extension of
the name to which it is assigned. Under any interpretation of ontology, every name is to
have some extensions …the names do not denote their extensions, they merely have their
extensions (p. 178).
and this is where we leave them. The problem is that extensions thus understood
are prima facie nominalistically unacceptable, and the authors do not provide any
argument to the effect that they are not.19
18 I discussed their arguments because they focus on arguments against substitutional interpretation
of higher-order logics speciﬁcally and they cover most of the interpretations that usually come
to one’s mind. As for general qualms about substitutional interpretation I believe they have been
dealt with by Kripke (1976). I will brieﬂy discuss an objection raised against the substitutional
interpretation (not necessarily higher-order) by Tomberlin (1997). The argument is intriguing, and
it is interesting to see how languages based on QNL avoid the difﬁculty. It goes (p. 160): On
the substitutional reading a sentence of the form ∀x F(x) is true iff all substitution instances of
Fx are true (where F is given a ﬁxed interpretation). But ‘the unique non-F’ is a legitimate sub-
stituent (terms do not have to be non-empty to be rightful substituents). Unfortunately, the sentence
‘F(the unique non-F)’ will always be false. Hence, the sentence ‘∀x F(x)’ will never be true,
because it will always have at least one false substitution instance.
One might object by denying that deﬁnite descriptions are legitimate substituents (because
they are incomplete symbols). Tomberlin has a rejoinder here: he can introduce ‘Scotty’ as a non-
referential name, and ﬁx its denotation (if it were to have one) as the one and only individual that
is not F and run the argument with ‘Scotty’ instead of the deﬁnite description.
TheproblemdoesnotariseforQNLevenifweadmitdeﬁnitedescriptionsasrightfulsubstituents.
First, how do we express the sentence that all objects have a certain property, or, when we speak
QNL that all objects fall under a certain name, say a? Certainly not by ‘∀b b ε a’, because this
will always be false (the substitution instance ‘ ε a’ is false). Rather, we say that any object is
a, ‘∀b (b ε b →b ε a)’. But consider the substitution instance that we get when we substitute ‘the
unique non-a’ for b:
If the unique non-a is the unique non-a, then the unique non-a is a.
If there are no objects which are not a (or if there are at least two such objects), the descriptions
fails to denote and the sentence comes out vacuously true. If, on the other hand, there is a unique
object which is not a, then the sentence also gets the correct truth-value, for it is true that the unique
non-a is the unique non-a but false that it is a.
19 They remark that “A Le´sniewskian system …has the advantage that it is at least as powerful as
any Russellian system without admitting sets into the universe of discourse; that is, without putting,
say, real things and sets …into the same universe. The sets are here recognized as purely linguistic
entities, which play their role as extensions in the range of quantiﬁcation, not in the universe of
discourse.” (p. 179) but this looks more like mere verbalism than like a real explanation. The reader
is still left with the idea that sets have to be in the range in quantiﬁcation and has no idea as to how
they are to be explained away by saying that they are ‘purely linguistic entities’.

8.5 Simons’s Combinatorial Semantics
201
8.5 Simons’s Combinatorial Semantics
Another account of Le´sniewski’s quantiﬁers has been developed by Simons (1985),
who suggested that we can think of Le´sniewskian quantiﬁers as ranging over ways of
meaning (a phrase he coined, henceforth ‘WOMs’). He did not deﬁne the notion, but
he made important moves to clarify it. The intuition is that the WOM of an expression
is that part of the semantical character of this expression which contributes to the truth
of complex sentences (of the extensional language of Ontology). Two examples: the
WOM of ‘Rafal Urbaniak’ is that it refers to only one object, me. The WOM of the
Boolean conjunction is that only when applied to two true sentences it yields a true
sentence.
First of all, we are told, in the present context we have to consider only extensional
aspects of WOMs. Hence his ﬁrst postulate:
(8.5) Coextensive expressions mean in the same way.
Also, the grammatical differences are supposed to “represent” differences in refer-
ence (denotation):
(8.6) No two expressions of different semantic category can mean in the same way.20
In other words, two expressions which could mean in the same way, possess the
same mode of meaning and expressions in different sematic category never have
the same mode of meaning. Two expressions can have the same mode of meaning
and yet have different WOMs.
(8.7) Expressions have the same mode of meaning iff they are of the same semantic category.
(8.7) is not a deﬁnition. It only speciﬁes that the way Ontology is constructed its
grammar mirrors the distinction between different modes of meaning. Then we have
two principles associated with compositionality:
(8.8) The WOM of a complex expression is determined by the WOMs of its constituents.
(8.9) The mode of meaning of a functor expression is determined by the modes of meaning
of its arguments and values.
Now Simons has to specify the mode of meaning of expressions of primitive syntactic
categories:
(8.10) The mode of meaning of sentences is to be true or false.
(8.11) The mode of meaning of names is to designate.
Among the WOMs that names can have, Simons distinguishes certain submodes;
there are lots of submodes but those interesting from the present perspective are
designating no/at least n/exactly n/at most n/all objects, etc.
20 Simons is using Le´sniewski’s terminology, so he speaks of ‘semantic category’. In Ontology,
however, the category of an expression is determined syntactically.

Nominalism and Higher-Order Quantiﬁcation
An example. Suppose we consider an expression which syntactically is a two-
place propositional connective (or suppose we are considering a variable of the same
syntactic category and ask ourselves what the range of quantiﬁcation is). How many
WOMs can it have? Well, a WOM of a propositional connective is speciﬁed by its
output for each possible input, we are told. There are 2n possible inputs, and since
there are two possible outputs, there are 22n possible WOMs of such a propositional
connective.
The WOM of a name constant is speciﬁed by determining what objects it refers to.
Simons represents WOMs of expressions of propositional logic by means of tables
(and this is doable, because they would always be ﬁnite objects), and suggests that
this method can be somehow extended to WOMs that names have. For this purpose
he introduces designation tables. For instance, if there are two objects in the domain:
A, B there are four ways a name could mean and we can represent them by a, b,–,
and ab respectively:
Does it denote
A?
B?
a
Yes
No
b
No
Yes
–
No
No
ab
Yes

Suppose we now want to specify the way ε means in that model based on the
WOMs of its two arguments:
Inputs
Output
WOM of ﬁrst argument
WOM of second argument

The idea is that quantiﬁcation ranges over WOMs (e.g. if a is the only free variable
in φ(a), the sentence ∀a φ(a) is satisﬁed in a model if and only if for any WOM a
can have φ(a) is true in that model), Simons suggests, and such quantiﬁcation does

8.5 Simons’s Combinatorial Semantics
203
not commit one to the existence of objects which are WOMs. Simons remarks: “Note
again that the inputs and outputs of these semantic tables are not expressions or any
other objects connected directly with a particular language. They are ways of mean-
ing” (Simons 1985, 208). Simons also argues that WOMs cannot be actual objects,
because “there are more ways of meaning than the objects to be named” (p. 212).
This argument from cardinality is a bit hasty, though. It seems that a certain
ambiguity is involved. In one sense an object has to be an element of the domain of
things that names can name. On this reading, we probably do not want to treat WOMs
as objects, that is, we do not want to consider possible names which name WOMs
as admissible substituents for basic name variables to avoid diagonal arguments.
In the other sense (which probably is more essential here) WOMs are actual
objects if they really exist, no matter whether we can put them in one single domain
of quantiﬁcation or not. The claim that WOMs are not objects in the ﬁrst sense
(likely true) does not entail that they are not objects in the second sense. The ﬁrst
claim is only about a certain limit on what names can refer to in a certain (possibly
formal) language. The second claim is general and metaphysical, and it is this second
sense which is relevant for questions of ontological commitment. (In a sense, what is
needed for the passage from the former to the latter is the unobvious assumption that
all objects can be thrown together in one big domain of truly universal quantiﬁcation.
Say we agree that WOMs are not objects. It is still not clear what they are. The
postulates given by Simons or the fact that some of them (those which are generated
from a ﬁnite domain of “urelements”) can be represented by tables do not provide a
philosophical explanation of their metaphysical status.21
Even if we assume that tables adequately represent ways names could mean with
respect to a model, the method does not make it possible to express the meaning of ε.
The best that a table can do is to express the way ε, means with respect to a model, and
this works also only in ﬁnite models. What we want to have is a general description
of what is common to all the WOMs of ε in all models, and this cannot be represented
by a table. Thus, Simons’s approach, as he admits, offers only an elucidation, not a
full-blown account of the notions involved. While sometimes this is the best we can
do, it might be worthwhile to see if there are more elaborate philosophical accounts
on the market.
8.6 Rickey’s Natural Models
After a simple reformulation (accommodating it to QNL), Rickey’s natural semantics
(Rickey 1985) is a model theory for QNL which, he believed, does not commit one
to sets when one uses the system. The basic idea is that we take names to belong
21 There is also a slight technical difﬁculty here. Unless we represent tables set-theoretically, a
formal semantics which would employ tables that list objects, inputs and outputs would be quite
unmanageable.

204

Nominalism and Higher-Order Quantiﬁcation
to a distinct set of objects existing in the model and denotation relation to be given
together with the world.
More speciﬁcally, Rickey’s natural model is a tuple ⟨i, n, ∼⟩, where i is a (pos-
sibly empty) set of individuals in the world, n is a non-empty set of names in the
world and ∼⊆n × i. A natural interpretation of a formula φ is a natural model
together with a valuation function v which maps name variables occurring in φ into
n.22 Let I = ⟨i, n, ∼⟩. The deﬁnition of satisfaction (relative to a valuation function)
is:
⟨I, v⟩|= a ε b iff ∃!x∈iv(a) ∼x ∧∃x∈i(v(a) ∼x ∧v(b) ∼x)
(8.12)
⟨I, v⟩|= ¬φ iff ⟨I, v⟩̸|= φ
⟨I, v⟩|= φ ∧ψ iff ⟨I, v⟩|= φ and ⟨I, v⟩|= ψ
⟨I, v⟩|= ∀a φ(a) iff ⟨I, v′⟩|= φ(b)
where b is a variable which does not occur in φ, and
v′ extends v by mapping b into nas well.
Rickey constructed interpretations of this sort to criticize Küng and Canty (1970)
by showing that substitutional interpretations can have an inﬁnite domain of indi-
viduals and nevertheless the domain of names does not have to be uncountable to
provide sufﬁcient “substitutional” foundation for higher-order quantiﬁcation. For
indeed, even if the domain of ⟨I, v⟩is inﬁnite, there are uncountably many ⟨I, v′⟩to
do the right job in cooperation with clause (8.12).
A technical remark ﬁrst. As the semantics stands, it does not avoid the difﬁculties
raised by Küng and Canty. For even an extended valuation function v′ of (8.12) will
map new variables into the same old n with the ∼already ﬁxed. (Thus, quantiﬁcation
will be in fact restricted to extensions of those names which already are in the
original model). This is rather clearly a feature that Küng and Canty would ﬁnd
problematic. In other words, what we get is a semantics equivalent to non-standard
set-theoretic semantics for higher-order logic, and that means that we will not have
certain properties that higher-order logic usually is expected to have (incompleteness,
categoricity etc.).
Also, the satisfaction conditions do not seem right if ∼is not allowed to vary. If,
for example, in I all names are ∼-related to one and the same object, no extension
of v to a new name variable will allow a name to refer to something else than that
object.23
Perhaps it would agree more with Rickey’s intentions to say that ∀a φ(a) is sat-
isﬁed in a model I = ⟨i, n, ∼⟩under a valuation v if and only if φ(a) is satisﬁed in
22 This is the reason why Rickey postulated that n be non-empty. He needed at least one object to
map name variables to.
23 I owe this remark to Richard Zach.

8.6 Rickey’s Natural Models
205
any model I ′ = ⟨i, n′, ∼′⟩(where n′ = n ∪{y} and y is a new element of n′ and ∼′
extends ∼) under the valuation v′ that assigns this new element y of n′ to a.24
Rickey did not give any argument to the effect that QNL with his semantics does
not carry ontological commitment to sets. A plausible case for this claim, however,
can be made. First, the quantiﬁcation itself does not bring a commitment to sets. It is
substitutional and names are individual objects taken to exist in a world pretty much
just like individuals. Second, the way that names contribute to the truth conditions
of atomic sentences is non-committal either. Names on this view do not refer to
objects via sets. They simply refer to objects directly. Saying that a name refers
to objects (e.g. that ‘dog’ refers to dogs) is not the same as saying that it names a
unique set whose members fall under this name (e.g. that ‘dog’ names a unique set
whose all and only elements are dogs and dogs fall under the name ‘dog’ in virtue
of belonging to this set).25
8.7 Relational Semantics for Plural Quantiﬁcation
Borrowing intuitions from Simons and Rickey, let us try to develop a nominalistically
acceptable interpretation of plural quantiﬁers.
In the relational semantics for QNL quantiﬁers range over certain ways names
could be. Relational models deﬁned below will introduce the notion formally in
a fairly well-known framework. This will allows us to get a better handle on the
semantics and hopefully provide us with a better understanding of this notion.
Suppose we start with a world which for our purposes is devoid of linguistic
objects (especially names). The content of this world is our domain of (already
existing) extralinguistic individuals, call it the bare world. In such a world, it is
possible to introduce names which would either be empty or refer to one or more
already existing objects. In this setting we can take a possible world to consist of
two sorts of objects: bare individuals (those which do not name anything) and names
that either do not name anything or name (one or more) extralinguistic individuals.
The situation in a possible world determines what reference the names that exist in
it have (if there are any). The bare world can be also interpreted as such a possible
world, only (at least) one of the sorts would be empty. Starting with the bare world
we can subsequently extend its repertoire of names by introducing (countably many)
new names that refer to bare individuals. Let us idealize here: we are not putting
any restrictions on which individuals can be named by a name, we assume that any
bare individual (or any bare individuals) is (are) nameable. This gives raise to the
so-called naming structure:
24 Another option would be to avoid extending the set of names and just vary ∼. This would yield
the same result. I prefer to extend the set of names in order to make this semantics more similar to
the one I will talk about soon.
25 A similar point has been made by Boolos (1998a), where the reader can look for a more emphatic
and detailed explanation of the difference.

206
8
Nominalism and Higher-Order Quantiﬁcation
Deﬁnition 8.1. A naming structure is a tuple ⟨I, W⟩where I is a set (of bare
individuals) and W is a set of possible worlds. A possible world is a tuple ⟨N, δ⟩
where I ∩N = ∅and δ ⊆N × I. A bare world is the possible world with N = ∅.
The following conditions all have to be satisﬁed:
(i) B = ⟨∅, ∅⟩∈W (i.e. the naming structure contains a bare world).
(ii) For any B ̸= w = ⟨N, δ⟩, N is countable and N ̸= ∅.
The accessibility relation on possible worlds is deﬁned by the following condition.
Let w = ⟨N, δ⟩, w′ = ⟨N ′, δ′⟩. Rww′ if and only if N ⊂N ′ and {⟨x, y⟩| x ∈
N ∧⟨x, y⟩∈δ′} = δ (i.e. δ′ ∩N × I = δ).
⊣
If M is a naming structure and I is the set of its bare individuals, I say that I
underlies M or that M is based on I. If M = ⟨I, W⟩and w ∈W I will sometimes
write w ∈M.
A few words of explanation here. First, we start “constructing” a naming structure
with a bare world. This bare world together with I represents the situation where we
have a set of objects that can be named but we have not introduced any names yet.
Since in principle (unless one has very speciﬁc religious beliefs) there is no reason
to believe in unnameable individuals, the I in the bare worlds is simply the domain
of objects.
We are considering ways individuals which are not names could be named. This
means that introducing new names does not change the domain of individuals (that is
why I is a set in the naming structure and does not vary with possible worlds). Also,
this indicates that the only way we get from one possible world to another accessible
world is by extending the repertoire of available names (so N has to be a proper
subset of N ′).
On the nominalist reading, quite plausibly, names are ﬁnite sequences of symbols
(or phonemes) from a ﬁnite alphabet. This means that in any possible world there
can be at most countably many names (hence the requirement that N be countable).
Moreover, the basic idea is that by “going” to another possible world we are extend-
ing what we already have; not changing the ways that names that we already have
are. That is, we can add a new name and take it to refer to such-and-such objects,
but the reference of the already existing names cannot be changed. In a sense, names
are thought of as given with reference. Hence the denotation relation in an accessi-
ble world has to agree with the initial denotation relation on all names that already
existed before we extended the set of names.
This sort of structure will not ensure yet that every intuitively possible “way of
meaning” will have a representation in a model. To do this, we have to require that
for any subset of the domain of individuals in a possible world there be an accessible
possible world in which there is a name which denotes all and only its elements.
Deﬁnition 8.2. Let ⟨N, δ⟩= w ∈W. A naming structure M = ⟨I, W⟩is w -comp-
lete if and only if:
∀A ⊆I ∃w′ = ⟨N ′, δ′⟩(Rww′ ∧∃x ∈N ′ ∀y ∈I (δ′(x, y) ≡y ∈A))

8.7 Relational Semantics for Plural Quantiﬁcation
207
M = ⟨I, W⟩is complete iff for any w ∈W M is w-complete.
⊣
The basic idea is that a naming structure is w-complete iff for any set of individuals
existing in this world, there is a world accessible from w where a name which names
elements of this set exists. In other words, it is w-complete if it models the full range
of ways names of objects from w could be.
The reason why B-completeness is not sufﬁcient is that the class of B-complete
naming structures would agree with classical set-theoretic semantics only on sen-
tences with only one quantiﬁer. In a naming structure, the iteration of quantiﬁers
carries us deeper and deeper into the structure.
I can now explain how quantiﬁcation in QNL is supposed to range over ways
names could be (or refer). I will be evaluating sentences in a name structure by
evaluating them in its bare world. First, we have to deﬁne satisfaction of a formula
at a world in a naming structure.
Deﬁnition 8.3. An M-interpretation is a triple ⟨M, w, v⟩, where M is a naming
structure, w = ⟨N, δ⟩is a possible world in M and v either assigns to every variable
in QNL an element of N, if N ̸= ∅, or is the empty function on the set of vari-
ables of QNL otherwise. If M is a complete naming structure, then we say that this
M-interpretation is complete.
Satisfaction of formulas under M-interpretations is deﬁned as follows.
Deﬁnition 8.4. Let ⟨M, w, v⟩be an M-interpretation, w = ⟨N, δ⟩. Also, let a and b
be QNL-variables and φ and ψ be QNL-formulas. The relevant satisfaction clauses
are:
⟨M, w, v⟩|=⋄a ε b iff v(a) and v(b) are deﬁned, ∃!x∈I⟨v(a), x⟩∈δ,
and ∃y ∈I (⟨v(a), y⟩∈δ ∧⟨v(b), y⟩∈δ).
⟨M, w, v⟩|=⋄¬φ iff v is not the empty function and ⟨M, w, v⟩̸|= φ.
⟨M, w, v⟩|=⋄∃a φ iff for some w′ ∈M, Rww′ and ⟨M, w′, v′⟩|= φ
where v′ differs from v at most in what it assigns to a.
(I skip the clause for conjunction because it is fairly standard, but I give the clause
for negation because it is slightly different from the usual formulation.)
The basic idea is that we treat the class of names that exist in a certain world as the
class of substituends when we evaluate a formula in this world. Since the bare world
does not contain names the notion of satisfaction in the bare world as applied to open
formulas is not very fascinating. No formula containing free variables will be satisﬁed
at the bare world. The situation changes when it comes to evaluating sentences in
bare worlds. First, let us say that a sentence is true in a naming structure M if and
only if it is satisﬁed in its bare world under any valuation. A sentence is M-valid if
and only if it is true in any naming structure. A sentence is M-complete valid if it is
true in any complete naming structure.

Nominalism and Higher-Order Quantiﬁcation
Theorem 8.1. The following correspondence holds:
(a) For any set-theoretic QNL model there is a complete M-model which agrees with
it on all formulas.
(b) For any complete M-model there is a set-theoretic QNL model which agrees with
it on all formulas.
Argument By model construction:
Ad (a). Suppose a formula φ fails at an S-model M = ⟨D, In⟩, let a1, . . . ak
be all variables that occur in φ. Take a naming structure w with I = D. Since the
structure is complete, there exists a possible world w = ⟨N, δ⟩such that for any
A ⊆D, if for some i, In(ai) = A then there is a y ∈N such that for all x ∈I,
δ(y, x) ≡x ∈A. If In(ai) = A let v(ai) be an arbitrary y ∈N for which this
condition ( ∀x ∈I (δ(y, x) ≡x ∈A) holds. Then also φ fails at this possible world
under v. The proof (that M and w agree on φ) goes by induction. If, on the other
hand, φ does not fail at M, then it also does not fail at any naming structure w with
I = D. If it did, then using the procedure described in (b) below we could show that
it would also fail at the original S-model.
Ad (b). I will just show, given a non-bare world in a naming structure and a
valuation function, how to construct a corresponding S-model that satisﬁes exactly
those formulas that are satisﬁed at that world under that valuation. Take a w = ⟨N, δ⟩
in a naming structure based on I. Let v map name variables a1, a2, . . . into N. To
obtain an equivalent S-model w′ = ⟨D, In⟩take D = I and let In(ai) = {x ∈I |
δ(v(ai), x)} for any ai. The proof that two such models satisfy the same formulas is
by induction.
□
The following observations are in order. First, modulo this relational semantics,
QNL has an intuitive translation into a two-sorted ﬁrst-order quantiﬁed modal logic
with one additional primitive binary operator representing the naming relation, which
supports the idea that the commitment of QNL doesn’t have to go beyond that of
ﬁrst-order modal logic (the translation is rather straightforward). Second, the size
limitation objection does not apply here. Quantiﬁers are interpreted as ranging over
possible names, but not over possible names from one particular possible world but
rather over names that belong to the union of all sets of names from all accessible
possible worlds. The initial plausibility of the objection results from the ambiguity
between the following two readings:
[R1] It is possible that for every subset of the domain there is a name which names
all and only those objects which are elements of this subset.
[R2] For any subset of the domain it is possible that there is a name which names
all and only all its elements.
[R2] might hold even if [R1] fails. For instance, suppose the domain consists of
all real numbers. It is false that there is a possible world in which all elements of the
domain are named by individual terms, because there are not enough names in any
particular possible world. However, this does not mean that there are unnameable

8.7 Relational Semantics for Plural Quantiﬁcation
209
real numbers. Quite the contrary, every real number can be named in some accessible
possible world. The abundance of numbers arises from the abundance of accessible
possible worlds—the ways names could be.
8.8 Philosophical Qualms
Let’s take a look at certain philosophical qualms about the nominalistic acceptability
of this approach. The ﬁrst objection focuses on the ontological commitment of the
possible-world discourse. The second one emphasizes that the modal reconstructions
failtoavoidtheepistemologicaldifﬁcultiesthatrealismrunsinto.Thethirdonepoints
out that while giving a nominalist reconstruction, I have employed set theory in
metatheory. The fourth one questions whether the approach developed in this paper
can handle the size limitation objection. The ﬁrth one doubts whether the current
semantics improves in any sense on the semantics of plural quantiﬁcation provided by
Boolos. The sixth one takes issue with the assumption of completeness. The seventh
objection focuses on the so-called set-theoretic content of QNL. The eighth one turns
around the claim that the multiple reference relation is more committing than singular
relation. Finally, the ninth objection relies on the claim that employing the notion of
‘being true of’ carries nominalistically undesirable ontological commitment.
8.8.1 Modality and the Innocence of Possible Worlds
An objection can be raised that while explaining away the quantiﬁcation over sets
I do it at the expense of taking on the commitment to possible worlds. This sort of
objection has been raised by Wole´nski (1992) against Chihara (1990).26
Responding merely that possible worlds discourse is a convenient myth27 is not
philosophically satisfactory: one needs to explain how such a myth can be useful in
26 ThereissomesimilaritybetweenthemodalaccountIproposeandChihara’suseofconstructibility
quantiﬁers. There are some differences, however. When we extend the language to higher-order
names (the strategy that lies beyond the scope of the present work, cf. (Urbaniak 2008c), the
result will not resemble type theory, but rather a cumulative hierarchy. Instead of introducing
constructibility quantiﬁers explicitly I model ways names could be using standard modalities and
reshaping the accessibility relation, which allows for more ﬂexibility and captures the philosophical
ideas in a more familiar framework. I also think that the framework I presented is easier to generalize
to obtain a better nominalistic account of the language of set theory or arithmetic (especially the
fact that mathematical terms behave like singular terms), but let’s not concern ourselves with these
issues here (see however Urbaniak (2010) for details).
27 “Remember, that for me, this whole possible world structure is an elaborate myth, useful for
clarifying and explaining modal notions, but a myth just the same. It would be a mistake to take this
myth too seriously and imagine that we are exploring real worlds, ﬁnding there real open-sentence
tokens that have puzzling features” (Chihara 1990, 60).

Nominalism and Higher-Order Quantiﬁcation
a philosophical account of the truth of serious theoretical statements.28 Ultimately,
the nominalist, for the success of the current enterprize, should either provide a
philosophically compelling nominalistic account of the possible-world talk, or to
explain the modal notions involved without reference to possible worlds. While both
of these issues lie beyond the scope of this chapter, the following remarks are due.
Given the multiplicity of anti-realist approaches to possible world discourse, it is
far from obvious that the nominalist is committed to abstract objects just because he
employs the possible-world talk. This is especially so, because the involved notion
of possibility isn’t as heavily theory-laden as various other modalities. The notion
of nameability does not require the existence of persons who can actually name
objects, nor does it require the real existence of other possible worlds where possible
names exist. Certain objects are considered nameable if by introducing a name that
multiply denotes exactly those objects we would not run into a paradox, and that
is all there is to it. A theory of nameability thus understood is not a chapter in
mathematical theology (if I may borrow an expression from Boolos et al. (2002, 19))
concerned with ideal naming agents, other real worlds and so on, but rather a theory
which tries to describe certain conditions under which a name that denotes certain
objects can be introduced without worrying about consistency and paradoxes. Vivid
metaphors which employ possible worlds and an ideal naming agent may be helpful
in clarifying logical properties of the modalities involved, but otherworldly objects
or the possible behavior of ideal agents are not what the theory is about, pretty
much like the computability theory is not really about possible worlds where certain
computations are performed. Intuitively, the interpretation of quantiﬁers in QNL
sentences boils down to phrases like ‘it is possible to introduce a name (it wouldn’t
lead to a paradox if we introduced a name) which refers in such-and-such a way such
that…’. But this, prima facie, does not commit one to abstract objects.29
Finally, even if you’re not convinced that possible-world talk is nominalistically
kosher, the conditional upshot remains that if the nominalist can use such modalities,
they can also make sense of higher-order quantiﬁcation.
8.8.2 Epistemology and Modality
Shapiro(1993) suggests that theepistemological challenges toPlatonism(Benacerraf
1973) apply also to modal approaches:
At least prima facie, the epistemology of the various modal notions is more tractable than an
epistemology of abstract objects like sets. The contention of this paper, however, is that this
promise is not delivered. The epistemological problems facing the anti-realist programmes
are just as serious and troublesome as those facing realism. Moreover, the problems are, in
28 Chihara has much more to say about possible worlds and modalities (see Chihara 1998), and he
makes quite a strong case for the nominalistic acceptability of possible worlds talk.
29 A big watershed here is obviously whether the modal talk can be done entirely in terms of modal
operators. This issue, however, lies beyond the scope of this already long chapter.

8.8 Philosophical Qualms
211
a sense, equivalent to those of realism. No gain is posted, and in some cases there is a loss
(Shapiro 1993, 456).
The core of Shapiro’s criticism seems to be this:
Ishowthat there are straightforward,oftentrivial,translationsfromthe set-theoretic language
of the realist to the proposed modal language, and vice-versa. The translations preserve
warranted belief, at least, and probably truth (provided, of course, that both viewpoints
are accepted, at least temporarily). Under certain conditions, the regimented languages are
deﬁnitionally equivalent, in the sense that if one translates a sentence φ of one language
into the other, and then translates the result back into the original language, the end result is
equivalent (in the original system) to φ. The contention is that, because of these translations,
neither system can claim a major epistemological advantage over the other. Any insight
that the modalist claims for his system can be immediately appropriated by the realist, and
vice-versa. The problem, however, lies with the "negative" consequences of the translations.
The epistemological problems with realism get "translated" as well (p. 457).
Putting technical qualms about translations aside, the worry seems to be that the
modal reconstruction, since it preserves theoremhood, is left with the truth of pretty
much the same (modulo translation) set of truths to explain.
There is an important distinction to be made, if this argument is to be dealt with
adequately (for simplicity let’s focus on a particular theory, ZFC): the distinction
between a mathematical theory whose truth is to be explained itself (ZFC itself), and
the same mathematical theory together with the realist philosophical story about it
(in our case, ZFC plus a Platonist account of sets, call it ZFC+).
The mathematical theory itself doesn’t contain any philosophical claims about
the ontological status of objects that it is about. Further philosophical story is only
to be provided, if the theory is to be given a deeper philosophical understanding.
Indeed, even most successful mathematicians using set-theory rarely have devel-
oped any deeper philosophical ontological considerations meant to interpret what
they’re doing. What’s more, often different mathematicians when asked philosophi-
cal questions about set theory, either explicitly don’t care or give completely different
answers. This suggests that to use ZFC as a successful mathematical tool one doesn’t
need any deep philosophical understanding of the language of set theory, pretty much
like to spill ink one doesn’t have to have read and understood Austin’s “Three ways
of spilling ink” (Austin 1966).
Now suppose one gives a modal-nominalist account of ZFC: a translation of
the language of ZFC into some (not necessarily really different) language, a certain
theory (call it NZFC) such that ZFC and NZFC are the same under such translation30
and a nominalistic philosophical account of the truth of NZFC (let’s dub NZFC with
this explanation NZFC+).
Is the fact that NZFC is modulo translation pretty much the same as ZFC a serious
objection against the nominalistic acceptability of this philosophical explanation? I
would like to submit, it isn’t. If the mere agreement on theorems of ZFC and NZFC
were to bring in the same epistemological worries as those that ZFC+ encounters,
any nominalistic attempt to reconstruct ZFC would be pointless to start with. This,
30 Or at least such that NZFC is a supertheory of ZFC, modulo translation.

212

Nominalism and Higher-Order Quantiﬁcation
however, seems hasty and far from obvious. Even if nominalistic reconstructions are
doomed, it is unlikely that it is mere theoremhood preservation per se that brings
doom.
If NZFC+ preserved the truth of ZFC+, that would be a serious problem for
the nominalist. The thing is, it isn’t supposed to do that. Quite to the contrary, the
nominalist doesn’t want to preserve the truth of ZFC+ minus ZFC. He explicitly
disagrees with it.
In general, the philosophical signiﬁcance of interpretability of formal theories is
a tricky issue and it is far from obvious that a mathematical interpretability result
automatically shows that any philosophical account of the interpretans has to inherit
the issues encountered by the Platonist’s favorite philosophical account of the inter-
pretandum. For instance, it is rather hasty to claim that there is a strong philosophical
connection between real analysis and geometry just because the former can be inter-
preted in the latter.
Perhaps, a more general worry still stands: how come that the modal notions are
to be more tractable than the Platonist account, and yet yield support to the same
mathematical theory? Well, this depends on what we mean by tractability.
Iftractabilityismeasuredintermsofstrengthofmathematicaltheorieswhosetruth
is being philosophically explained, then sure, any good reconstruction should have
(more or less) the same level of tractability. But, for the reasons described above, it is
far from obvious that tractability thus understood is a measure of epistemic viability
of the associated philosophical account.
If tractability is rather taken to capture our intuitions about relative viability of
the associated philosophical accounts, then mere theoremhood preservation of math-
ematical theories doesn’t have to preserve tractability, and since no mathematically
tractable notion of tractability thus understood has been developed, we have to rely
on our philosophical intuitions and judge these things on case-by-case basis.
That being the case, I submit that the account of modalities given in the previous
subsection is philosophically less demanding than Platonism. We might have good
reasons to believe that introduction of a certain name satisfying such-and-such con-
ditions wouldn’t lead to contradiction, because we’ve played around with various
paradoxical arguments enough to ﬁgure out that as long as our naming hierarchy is
grounded, we’re safe. On the other hand, no amount of time spent on doing logic or
mathematics seems to move us towards having better epistemic access to causally
inert abstract objects as pictured by the Platonist.
8.8.3 Can We Use Set Theory in Metatheory?
A related worry shines through some of Shapiro’s remarks:
To be sure, the modal notions invoked by our antirealists do have uses in everyday (non-
mathematical) language, and competent speakers of the language do have some pre-theoretic
grasp of how they work. But this grasp, by itself, does not support the extensively detailed

8.8 Philosophical Qualms
213
articulation of the modal notions as they are employed by our anti-realists in their expli-
cations of mathematics. I think we do have a decent grasp of the extensive notions, but
this understanding is not pre-theoretic. Rather, it is mediated by mathematics, set theory in
particular. For example, one item concerns the relationship between model theory and the
intuitive notion of logical consequence, in all its modal, semantic, and epistemic guises. Of
course, everyone who reasons makes use of logical consequence, but some ontologists give
the notion of consequence a central role in their philosophical stories. And most contem-
porary philosophers have come to accept the model-theoretic explication of consequence,
which is executed in set theory, with all its ontology. The question at hand concerns the
extent to which our anti-realists are entitled to the hard won model-theoretic results (Shapiro
1993, 457).
The problem seems to be that despite the fact that we do have some pre-theoretic
understanding of the modalities at play, the nominalist still needs to use model theory
to elucidate her understanding of the consequence operation involved, and this set
theory is formulated in set-theory, which bears commitment to sets.
One way to read the argument is to take it to proceed from [C1] to [C2]:
[C1] Set theory is used (indispensably) in the metatheory of a logic.
[C2] This logic is committed to the existence of sets.
But this is not a compelling strategy. After all, set theory is also used in the
metatheory of ﬁrst-order logic and no one claims that by the same token ﬁrst-order
quantiﬁcation commits one to the existence of sets.
On a more charitable and weaker reading, the worry is that the modal semantics for
QNL is motivated by nominalism, and it is suspicious that someone who cares about
nominalistic acceptability of QNL doesn’t mind using set theory in meta-theory.
Suspicious as it may be, it is not incoherent. Someone might be a mathematical
realist in general, and claim merely that it is not with QNL that the commitment to
abstract objects kicks in. But sure, this is not a standard position either.
A more uniform response on the part of the nominalist might be that she indeed
doesn’t believe in abstract objects in general. Still, there is a sense in which set-theory
is still available to her in a kind of reductio argument. If she intends to convince
someone who doesn’t mind using set theory about the ontological innocence of
QNL, she is free to use set-theory, no matter what she thinks about its nominalistic
acceptability.
This strategy, although not completely ﬂawed, is rather risky. If the nominalist
really thinks set theory carries commitment to abstract objects, then even if the
Platonist might become convinced about the innocence of QNL, the argument won’t
work for the nominalist herself and won’t provide her with what she herself could
take as a philosophically relevant account of QNL quantiﬁcation.
Another reply on the part of the nominalist might be to say that the set theory
employed in the description is very weak, and that in fact the intuitive explanation
of the semantics might be equally well given in a metalanguage employing modally
understood QNL-like quantiﬁcation instead of set-theory talk. Arguably, using intu-
itively understood QNL quantiﬁcation in the metalanguage while giving a semantics
for QNL quantiﬁcation in the object language is not worse than giving semantics for

214
8
Nominalism and Higher-Order Quantiﬁcation
ﬁrst-order quantiﬁers in a metalanguage in which ﬁrst-order quantiﬁcation already
can be expressed.31
Yet another strategy for the nominalist would be to rely on the distinction between
a mathematical theory and the mathematical-theory-cum-philosophical-account bun-
dle, already employed in sect. 8.8.2. On this approach, the fact that the nominalist uses
ZFC (or NZFC for that matter) does not make her committed to abstract objects, as
long as using NZFC and additional philosophical consideration, she is able to develop
a compelling NZFC+.
Of course, this is nowhere close to getting off Neurath’s ship. The point is, how-
ever, that it is philosophically respectable to use NZFC (but not ZFC+) and some
philosophical ideas to explain how one can interpret NZFC (or simply ZFC) in a
nominalistically acceptable way (just like it is respectable to use English and certain
philosophical ideas to develop a philosophy of language that applies to English itself).
There is no circularity involved here: it is ZFC with extra philosophical content that
is supposed to deliver the nominalistic acceptability of ZFC.
• A problem with this strategy is that it ultimately hinges on the availability of a plau-
sible nominalistic interpretation of ZFC. The onus probandi is on the nominalist:
a nominalistic interpretation of ZFC is still to be given. I believe such an account
can be given, but this issue lies beyond the content of this paper (see Urbaniak
(2010) for a sketch of such a nominalistic strategy; or consider an account given
by Hellman (1989)).
• Yet, it is unfair to say that the nominalist fails in providing a plausible nominal-
istic story about QNL quantiﬁcation just because she uses ZFC in model theory.
The nominalist is in the process of developing a philosophical account of ZFC
using (among other things) ZFC itself. Explaining why plural quantiﬁcation is
non-committing is only a step towards this goal, and this explanation should be
evaluated as such a step.
• One could ask: if the nominalist can use ZFC in her account of QNL quantiﬁcation,
why not use standard set-theoretic semantics to start with? The reason why this
wouldn’t work is that this wouldn’t contribute to showing that QNL quantiﬁcation
is nominalistically acceptable. In contrast, on the current approach it is emphasized
31 Here is an example of how such a description could start:
• Read ‘a possible world is a tuple composed of a set of individuals, a set of name tokens, and a
reference relation between these two’ as ‘a possible world contains individuals and name tokens
which refer to individuals’.
• Read the important part of Deﬁnition 8.1 as ‘To evaluate formulas, we need to be told what
individuals exist and what possible worlds can be considered. Among the latter, we need to
include a possible world in which no names exist, and any other possible world has to contain
countably many names. One possible world can access another if the latter contains all the names
that the former does (preserving what they refer to), and at least one new name’.
• To ensure completeness of our evaluation framework, we also need to assume that for any possible
world w, for any individuals, there is a possible world w′ in which a name exists which refers to
exactly these individuals.
Developing this alternative semantics in full, alas, lies beyond the scope of this chapter.

8.8 Philosophical Qualms
215
that the reading of QNL formulas does not involve reference to sets: ‘it is possible
to introduce a name token’ is more clearly nominalistically acceptable than ‘there
exists a set’.
Shapiro’s emphasis on the fact that set-theoretic model theory is needed to clarify the
modal notions involved points to yet another strategy which the nominalist can try:
to deny this assumption. Perhaps, instead of using set-theory to clarify the modalities
involved, one can rather take modalities as primitive and axiomatize them directly.
While this task has not been completed in this paper, Shapiro does not provide
an argument against the possibility of such an axiomatization either. Of course, this
controversy will have to wait for another day, when such axiomatizations are actually
proposed and their nominalistic acceptability is discussed on a case-by-case basis.
8.8.4 What About the Size Limitation Objection?
We can recall that one of the objections against the substitutional interpretation of
QNL was that if the domain is inﬁnite we will always run out of substituents for
under no circumstances the existence of uncountable inﬁnity of names is possible.
Naming structures by deﬁnition can only contain possible worlds with a countable
number of names. It does not follow, however, that we will run out of possible names
if the bare world is inﬁnite. In any complete naming structure any subset of the
domain will have a possible name corresponding to it. Of course, it is not the case
that there is a possible world which contains all such names simultaneously, but
that is not a problem for the modal interpretation of higher-order quantiﬁcation. The
initial plausibility of the objection results from the ambiguity between:
(8.13) It is possible that for every subset of the domain there is a name which names all and
only those objects which are elements of this subset.
and
(8.14) For any subset of the domain it is possible that there is a name which names all and
only all its elements.
Let us grant that the set of names in a possible world has to be countable; at least on
the nominalist view names are ﬁnite inscriptions or utterances over a ﬁnite alphabet.
The difference between the readings given above is pretty much like the difference
between the statement that it is possible that every real number has a name (which
would require the existence of uncountably many names) and the claim that for any
real number it is possible for it to have a name. The ﬁrst is false, the second true. Size
limitation objections may work well against (8.13). But it is not (8.13) but rather
(8.14) that is posited in the modal interpretation under discussion, and it is not prone
to this sort of difﬁculties.

Nominalism and Higher-Order Quantiﬁcation
8.8.5 Why not Go with Boolos’s Semantics?
Another question which can be asked is how the currently defended approach
improves on a semantics for plural quantiﬁcation developed by Boolos (1998a).
Strictly speaking, Boolos was talking about plural quantiﬁcation for the language
of set theory in which individual variables ranged over sets and the question was
whether second-order variables have to be taken as ranging over classes (proper
classes included). But accommodating this semantics to the case where individual
variables range over individuals and the question is whether second-order variables
have to be taken as ranging over sets is rather straightforward.
In such a semantics, satisfaction of a formula is deﬁned relative to a domain D,32 a
sequence s (an assignment), and what Boolos calls ‘a new […] second-order variable
“R”.’ (Boolos 1998a, 336) The key clauses are:
⟨D, s, R⟩|= V v iff R⟨V, s(v)⟩
⟨D, s, R⟩|= ∃v φ iff for some object x ∈D, there is a sequence t
which agrees with s on all variables different
from v, such that t(v) = xand ⟨D, t, R⟩|= φ.
⟨D, s, R⟩|= ∃V φ iff there is a T such that for any second-order
variableU other than V, for any x ∈D,
(T ⟨U, x⟩≡R⟨U, x⟩), and⟨D, s, T⟩|= φ.
Boolos comments on the status on the “new second-order variables” employed in
the metatheory:
The present theory, however, makes no explicit mention of sequences whose values are
(proper)classes[inourmodiﬁedcase:sets–RU].Itdoesnotproceedbyintroducingfunctions
that assign to each second-order variable a unique class, possibly proper. Instead it employs a
new predicate which, as one may say, is true or false relative to […] a sequence of ﬁrst order
variables, and some (or perhaps no) ordered pairs of second-order variables and sets [in our
case: individuals – RU] to the second-order variable R. There is, however, no need to take
the theory as assigning classes [in our case: sets – RU] […] to the second-order variables
(Boolos 1998a, 336–337).
The essence of the proposal is to allow plural interpretations of second-order vari-
ables, on which a second-order variable takes individuals as its values, but no restric-
tion is put on the number of its values.
While the nominalist will applaud the idea that second-order variables do not
have to range over sets, understanding the Boolean semantic clause for second-
order quantiﬁcation nominalistically might be problematic. How is the nominalist to
understand ‘there is a T ’ and those ‘new second-order variables’ in general?
32 Strictly speaking, Boolos takes the domain to be ﬁxed, but relativizing to a domain is a rather
trivial part of my straightforward modiﬁcation of Boolos’s semantics.

• One way to go is to take them to be binary predicates truly predicable of a second-
order variable and an object. On this reading, ‘R⟨v, x⟩’ simply reads ‘x is among
the values of the variable v’. The problem is, if the quantiﬁcation is taken to range
over predicates, the size limitation objection strikes back: there can be at most
countably many predicates (even worse, only ﬁnitely many predicates exist).
• Another way is to take them to plurally refer to ordered pairs of second-order
variables and individuals. The problem is, in this case ‘∃V φ’ reads ‘there are
some ordered pairs of variables and individuals T such that…’, and it is rather
unclear whether a nominalist who wants to dispose of classes will be ﬁne with
ordered tuples as referents.
• Perhaps, given that the nominalist should at least admit that certain predi-
cates/names sometimes refer to certain things, one could read ‘for some T ’ as ‘for
some reference relation’. But caution is advised—the nominalist usually doesn’t
think that reference relations ﬂoat around without tokens. Thus, it might be philo-
sophically more transparent to bring expression tokens into the picture (but then,
due to things like the size limitation objection, going modal seems advisable). But
any attempt to clear up such issues is very likely to lead into the general direction
sketched in this paper.
• Last but not least, it is not clear how the Boolean semantics can be generalized to yet
higher-order of quantiﬁcation. In contrast, bringing tokens into the picture allows
for further introduction of tokens referring to tokens, and so on (see (Urbaniak
2008c) and (Urbaniak 2010) for such a generalization of the framework developed
in this chapter).
8.8.6 Why Complete Naming Structures?
When we try to provide a nominalist story about a logic equivalent to QNL with
set-theoretic semantics, what reasons do we have to postulate that it is only complete
naming structures that matter? In a sense, why do we concern ourselves with such a
strong notion, one might say? If the claim is that this is what nameability really is
like, one might launch an attack along the following lines:
Certain objects are nameable if and only if there is a person who could name them. But it is
far from obvious that for any objects there is a person who can name them. For suppose a
person utters (or writes) a token and wants to establish its reference. It seems that she either
has to be able to formulate in her language a description which only those objects satisfy and
which employs only those expressions whose reference she may take for granted, or she has
to have direct epistemic access to those objects (well, at least pretty much as direct as the act
of pointing at an object, as opposed to determining reference through a description). But it
is not obvious that her language is sufﬁciently expressive to provide her with a description
that determines this set, and it is quite obvious that her relation to quite a few objects in the
world will be far from direct epistemic access. Hence, it seems, we should not attach that
sort of signiﬁcance to complete naming structures.
Here is a rejoinder to this sort of criticism. The required notion of nameability does
not require the existence of persons who can actually name those objects, nor does

218
8
Nominalism and Higher-Order Quantiﬁcation
it obviously require that there be an ideal agent who would be able to name certain
objects, had he existed in this possible world. We can consider objects belonging to a
certain set nameable if we know that by introducing a name that denotes all and only
its elements we would not run into troubles of logical nature, and that is all there is
to it (see also the remarks about mathematical theology on p. 196).
An analogy might help. Suppose someone argues:
Certain functions are computable if and only if there is a person who could compute them.
But it is far from obvious that for any (say) Turing computable function there is a person who
can compute its value for any input. Quite obviously, there are certain computable functions
and certain inputs such that no person alive would be able to compute the values of those
function for those inputs. Therefore we should not attach such signiﬁcance to the class of all
Turing-computable functions.
Arguments of this sort do not disprove the usefulness of the notion of Turing-
computability. At best, they just show that people’s actions are not exactly what
Turing computability theory is about. Also, even though the notion of computability
used here is indeed quite strong and therefore it may aid the imagination to think of it
as a theory of an ideal computer (in the good old sense of the word, when ‘computer’
meant the same as ‘reckoner’ or ‘ﬁgurer’), ideal computing agents are not exactly
the subjects of the discipline.
Let me draw another parallel here. Of high importance in Turing computability
theory are limitation theorems: the knowledge that even if we put pretty much no
practical restrictions on computability there still are functions which cannot be com-
puted is quite substantial. The purpose of the nameability theory is to provide an (in
a sense) substitutional semantics for QNL. Note that when we think of a logic substi-
tutionally one of our main concerns is to be able to apply it to any names whatsoever
without any uncertainty as to whether the validity or truth will be preserved when
we eliminate the universal quantiﬁer and substitute a name for the variable that it
binds. Here, widening the range of possible names contributes to the universality of
the logic.
8.8.7 Set-Theoretic Content of Plural Logic
Yet another style of arguments against the belief that the logic of plurals (or QNL
for that matter) is ontologically neutral can be extracted from an argument against
the logicality thesis (“the logic of plurals (or QNL) qualiﬁes as pure logic”). It is
not my present concern to deﬁne (or discover) what being a pure logic consists
in; let me just say that the main feature of plural logic that struck some people
as problematic is its apparently set-theoretic content. The claim that QNL has a
set-theoretic content, together with the initially plausible assumption that whatever
has set-theoretic content is committed to sets lead to the conclusion that QNL is
committed to sets.

Here is a good example of a discussion pertaining to the logicality of the logic of
plurals:33
First [in the logic of plurals] there are the tautologies and the inference rules governing
identity and the singular quantiﬁers. There is broad consensus that these qualify as logical.
Next there are the inference rules governing the plural quantiﬁers. Since these rules are
completely analogous to the rules governing the singular quantiﬁers it would be hard to deny
that they too qualify as logical. Then there are the extensionality axioms and the axiom that
all pluralities are non-empty. These axioms are unproblematic because they can plausibly be
taken to be analytic. What remains are the plural comprehension axioms, where things are
much less clear. For these axioms have no obvious singular counterparts, and their syntactical
form indicates that they make existential claims.34 (Linnebo 2004).
Mutatis mutandis, this objection can be mounted against the ontological innocence of
QNL: one might say, it not only makes existence claims (comprehension axioms of
the form ∃a ∀b (b ε a ≡b ε a ∧φ(b)) come out true in any complete naming struc-
ture), but also clearly has non-logical content because the comprehension axioms
have no corresponding ﬁrst-order (or singular) counterparts. Both qualms deserve
consideration. Let us start with the ﬁrst one.
Ifwebelievethatnameabilityisquitewell-understoodwithoutpostulatingabstract
objects and we accept the modal reading of QNL quantiﬁers, there is no reason to
read any serious existential import into comprehension axioms. They just mirror the
fact that for any formula φ of QNL at any possible world w there is no logical obstacle
to introducing a new name that would refer to those individuals in w which satisfy
φ the fact that names which coincide in reference with one-place open formulas of
QNL are logically admissible.35
Worries about the apparent existential form of comprehension notwithstanding,
there is yet another intuition behind this line of criticism. If something is a fairly
obvious generalization of what is already present in the standard ﬁrst-order logic, its
nature is logical. Thus, for instance (at least when it comes to the rules of inference in
any standard axiomatization) the rules pertaining to behavior of quantiﬁers in QNL
are on par with the rules pertaining to quantiﬁers in ﬁrst-order logic. The same goes
for rules pertaining to Boolean connectives. Comprehension axioms, on the other
hand, one might say, are something new: there is nothing in ﬁrst-order logic which
suggests anything like comprehension axioms in QNL.
This line of attack can be circumvented by describing a singular variant of compre-
hension. The essence of comprehension, as I take it, is that forming new deﬁnitions
of a certain sort does not lead outside of the quantiﬁer scope. Now, suppose we take
the ﬁrst-order language, but instead of giving it the standard set-theoretic semantics,
we develop for it a modal-substitutional semantics of the sort developed in this paper.
33 Linnebo (2003) considers also another argument against the ontological innocence of the logic
of plurals. Since it rather pertains to higher-order extensions of the logic of plurals, I will not talk
about it.
34 Linnebo remains neutral when presenting this argument, I just use his wording for its brevity and
clarity
35 Say we take φ(a) to refer to those objects whose singular names (had there been any) substituted
for a in φ(a) (which does not contain other free variables) would yield true sentences.

220
8
Nominalism and Higher-Order Quantiﬁcation
In such a context, the ﬁrst-order quantiﬁers range over possible ways singular terms
can be. Within this setting, it is rather clear what singular comprehension would do: it
would require that for any possible world, for any individual which can be described
in that language (that is, for any formula, which is satisﬁed by exactly one object), it
is possible to introduce a singular term referring to that individual.
8.8.8 Is Multiple Reference Relation Innocent?
Granted that quantiﬁcation over sets has been eliminated in virtue of the modal-
substitutional interpretation of plural quantiﬁcation, one can still raise doubts regard-
ing the innocence of the reference relation that possible names bear to objects in the
world. One could argue along the following lines:36
Ok, so we made names the values of variables. How does it help if, it seems, the names
themselves can still refer to sets via the δ relation? Why isn’t this just syntactic sugar?
To understand the misreading that stands behind this sort of objection let us ﬁrst
note that there are three, not two, readings involved. One, the straightforwardly set-
theoretic one reads ‘∃a ’ as:
(8.15) There is a set a such that…
The second one, which is the reading implicit in the above objection interprets ‘∃a ’
as:
(8.16) It is possible to introduce a name which refers to a certain set such that…
Of course, this second reading of quantiﬁers, even though, in a sense, substitutional,
does not eliminate ontological commitment to sets. The natural language reading that
the modal semantics I developed suggests is none of the above. Rather, it interprets
the phrase in question as:
(8.17) It is possible to introduce a name (which may not refer at all, refer to a unique object
or refer to multiple objects), such that …
The last reading does not interpret possible names as referring to sets. Rather, it
assumes that the fact that a name (a countable noun phrase) refers to multiple objects
or does not refer to anything at all is of the same ontologically innocent status as the
fact that a name refers to a unique object.
Even the most severe opponents of the ontological innocence of the logic of plurals
allow that reference of singular terms does not bring in any commitment to sets. So,
it seems, the reference relation alone is not a problem for a nominalist. Now, why
should this change when he admits that a name can fail to refer to anything? Well,
it should not. To say that ‘Spiderman’ does not refer to anything is not to say that
‘Spiderman’ refers to the empty set. It is only a very prejudiced commitment to the

‘Fido’-Fido principle that may convince one that for any expression there has to exist
its unique referent which explains how the expression contributes to the truth-value
of sentences in which it occurs. Having said this, let us ask: Why should the situation
be different when we turn to names that refer to more than one object?
It seems that competent language users which did not have any experience with
philosophy should have a say in this debate; and I presume that very few of them
would suggest that ‘Dogs are animals’ is true in virtue of there being certain objects
which do not exist in space and time37 such that each dog remains in a certain relation
of “belonging” to one of them and each animal remains in this relation to another
and those two untouchable objects remain in a certain unobservable relation. To the
contrary, the fact that underlies the truth of this sentence is quite observable and
pertains to certain real individual objects: dogs and animals. It requires a certain
amount of philosophical sophistry to deny that ‘dogs’ refers to dogs or that ‘animals’
refer to animals along the lines suggested above.
When we try to explain nominalistically the logic of plurals, there are two aspects
that have to be dealt with. First, we should say what plural quantiﬁers quantify over
(or how they should be interpreted). My reading is: they are modal devices which are
explained substitutionally in terms of possible countable noun phrases. Second, the
very use of plurals, even without quantiﬁers should be explained as nominalistically
acceptable. My explanation is: unless someone assumes that every expression should
have a unique referent and believes in set theory already there is no linguistic evidence
to the effect that the existence of sets is required to make sense of the reference of
plurals. Interpreting plurals as referring to sets has certain theoretic advantages when
we do formal semantics (set-theory is fairly well-known and the semantics is slightly
simpler), but this does not constitute any argument to the effect that this is the only
way to make sense of plural constructions. A more parsimonious answer is: plurals
refer to objects directly. ‘Dogs’ refers to dogs, ‘chairs’ refers to chairs and it is enough
to believe in the existence of chairs and dogs (as opposed to believing in the existence
of sets as well) in order to understand sentences in which ‘dogs’ or ‘chairs’ occur.
The expression ‘refers to’ in the relevant sense has pretty much the same meaning
as ‘is truly predicable of’. When we introduce a name for already existing objects, it
referstothosealreadyexistingobjectsofwhichitistrulypredicable.‘RafalUrbaniak’
refers to me because ‘This is Rafal Urbaniak’ is true when the utterer points at me.
There is nothing that forces us to say that being-truly-predicable-of in the case of
‘Rafal Urbaniak’ requires that there be a singleton set containing me as its sole
element. What is more, clearly if being-truly-predicable-of something is a necessary
conditionforreferringtothisthing(andthisishowIprefertounderstandthereference
relation), ‘Rafal Urbaniak’ does not refer to any set (even though being an eternal
being might be an upside of being a set, I tend to think of myself as an object which
is not out of space and time). Similarly, if we have an empty name, like ‘Superman’,
there is no object of which we can truly say that it is Superman (‘Superman’ is not
37 For the sake of simplicity I ignore the position that sets exist in space and time in addition to
usual objects as quite unbelievable. This position was held for a while by Maddy (1980). A plausible
criticism of it is to be found in Chihara (1990, 194–215).

truly predicable of the empty set). It is false that in this sense ‘Superman’ refers to the
empty set because it is false that the empty set is Superman. How about names that
intuitively name more than one object? The expression ‘chair(s)’ is truly predicable
of each and every chair and therefore every chair is a referent of the word ‘chair’.38
Also, the set of chairs (if there is such an object) is not a referent of the word ‘chair(s)’,
for it is not a chair itself. Hence, in this sense of the phrase, reference of names is a
relation between tokens and individuals themselves which does not proceed via sets
and which does not require the existence of sets.
8.8.9 Counting Reference Relations
A slightly related worry has been raised by Hochberg ( 1984). In the beginning of
his paper, he declares:
One attempt to avoid a platonistic ontology involves using the notion ‘is true of’. Using
this notion, one claims that a predicate, say ‘white’ is true of a particular object whereas
a sign such as a proper name refers to the object. This is done to avoid holding (1) that a
predicate refers to a universal property while the proper name refers to an individual and
(2) that a sentence used to predicate the one sign of the other indicates the fact that the
individual exempliﬁes the property. Thus, an attempt is made to offer a coherent ontology
recognizing only individuals. If cogent, this gambit provides a more parsimonious ontology
than platonistic alternatives. Here I shall argue that the gambit fails (Hochberg 1984, 150).
The core of the objection is that when the Platonists gives an account of the truth-
conditions of sentences like ‘a is W’ (where ‘a’ is a singular term, and ‘W’ a pred-
icate), they’re using one reference relation (the constant refers to an object, the
predicate refers to a property, and the sentence is true iff a possesses the property
W), whereas the nominalist requires two different reference relations: one for the
singular terms (reference), and one for the predicates (being true of), and thus “the
nominalistic gambit is no more parsimonious than the platonist’s” (p. 151).
The main reason why Hochberg thinks that different relations are involved is that
claims involving the Platonist’s reference relation, like:
‘a’ refers to a
‘W’ refers to W
display “an obvious triviality or emptiness”, reﬂecting “the redundancy that a label
labelswhatitlabels.Theycan,withappropriaterules,beseentobetruebyinspection”
(p. 151), whereas:
‘W’ is true of a
“…is quite different. It holds when the individual has the property, and hence does
not merely reﬂect our having interpreted certain signs” (ibidem).
38 Thus, on the view under discussion, the reference of distributive plurals is nothing above and
beyond the reference to particulars. This means that we also do not need anything like “mereological
fusion of all chairs” as the referent of ‘chair(s)’ (at least as far as plural quantiﬁcation is concerned).

8.8 Philosophical Qualms
223
There are a few moves the nominalist can make in response to this sort of criticism.
First of all, they might point out that the weight of someone’s ontological commit-
ment is not to be measured by counting the relations: as long as the relations are
nominalistically acceptable, the nominalist can admit as many of them as he pleases
without running into any immediate difﬁculty just because of the number of relations
that he admitted.
Secondly, they might point out that a rather uncharitable principle of counting
relations has been used in the argument: it doesn’t seem to hold in general that if in
certain cases it is more difﬁcult do ascertain whether a certain relation holds, there
really are two relations: one of the easier cases, and one for the more difﬁcult ones.
Thirdly, they might challenge the claim that there really is a deep epistemologi-
cal difference between the cases that Hochberg ﬁnds so radically different. Contra
Hochberg, claims like:
‘a’ refers to b
where ‘a’ is a singular term and ‘b’ is a singular term referring to the same object,
are far from being trivial. Actually, their lack of obviousness is a source of many
philosophical puzzles pertaining to naming, propositions and propositional attitudes.
Perhaps, the difference that Hochberg had in mind is that singular terms refer
directly, whereas multiply referring terms seem to refer via properties, and since the
nominalist doesn’t admit properties, they have to at least admit that the reference
relation is different. This doesn’t sound exactly right: the distinction between having
and not having a descriptive content cuts across the distinction between singular and
plural terms. I can easily point at the three chairs standing in my room and christen
them directly with a non-descriptive plural term. Anyway, even if there is a difference,
the nominalist can still express this fact that it is not two distinct reference relations,
but rather one reference relation holding between different some objects for more
complicated reasons.
Of course, the nominalist should tell a story about how to interpret predication
of descriptive terms without invoking properties (this lies beyond the scope of my
current considerations), but this is a different challenge from claiming that multiple
relation itself is a problem.
8.9 Loose Ends
Let me just end with brieﬂy reminding you what the main open tasks for the modal
nominalist are:
• The framework needs to be extended to the full-blown language of Ontology.
Arguably, once the framework of modal semantics is allowed, this is rather straight-
forward.
• The semantic account, if possible, should be superseded by an axiomatization
independent of set theory, given together with a philosophical defense of the

224

Nominalism and Higher-Order Quantiﬁcation
nominalistic acceptability of the axioms involved. This would deﬁnitely eradicate
concerns related to the role of set theory in the account. It is not known whether
this can be done.
• It would also be nice if the axiomatization could avoid the possible-world dis-
course, so that no worries about commitment to the existence of possible worlds
arise. Again, whether this can be achieved is not known. (See however Chihara
(1998) for an attempt.)
• All this would result only in a theory capable of emulating set theory. Yet, there are
standard concerns related to whether other mathematical objects can be plausibly
identiﬁed with sets (Benacerraf 1965), because there are often too many ways this
can be done for any of them to count as a compelling philosophical story. Thus,
a sensible way of extending the nominalistic framework to mathematical theories
other than set theory (other than emulation within set theory) should be provided.
While I do think these desiderata can be met, it is a story for a completely different
book.
