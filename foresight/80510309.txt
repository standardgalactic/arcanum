ABSTRACT 
  
Human health has benefitted from the use of natural products since the beginning 
of traditional medicine. Today, the majority of approved drugs have some connection to 
nature whether they are genuine natural products, derivatives thereof, or synthetic 
compounds whose structures were inspired by these secondary metabolites. 
Microorganisms, particularly actinomycetes, represent an important source of bioactive 
natural products; they are the original source of about two-thirds of all clinically used 
antibiotics as well as drugs used to treat cancer, parasitic infections and other ailments.  
Culturing actinomycetes under the standard conditions of the laboratory typically 
does not facilitate the production of all of the natural products that these organisms are 
genetically capable of biosynthesizing. As a result, the discovery of novel microbial 
natural products has diminished in recent years as the easily obtained compounds are 
repeatedly rediscovered. Strategies to induce the production of the unexpressed, or 
cryptic, natural products are therefore an important tool for natural product discovery 
programs, especially during present times when new antibiotics are desperately needed.  
One strategy that has been used successfully many times in the past is the one 
strain-many compounds approach. This technique involves the systematic variation of 
culture conditions in order to find a set that induces production of new, cryptic natural 
products. Three actinomycetes, Kitasatospora cystarginea NRRL B-16505, 
Kitasatospora griseola NRRL B-16229 and the Prince Edward Island sediment derived 
strain Streptomyces sp. RKND004 were subjected to fermentation in 14 different media. 
Data analysis using LC-HRMS based metabolomics led to the discovery of terrosamycin 
A and B, two polyether ionophores that were selectively produced by Streptomyces sp. 
RKND004 in specific liquid media. The terrosamycins exhibited excellent antibiotic and 
selective anticancer properties. In addition to these compounds, this approach highlighted 
a number of other putatively novel, induced metabolites which are awaiting discovery. 
Another strategy, co-culture, involves fermentation of two or more organisms in 
the same vessel in order to imitate an ecological situation and in turn, stimulate cryptic 
natural product production. Co-culture experiments have a lot of variables and are often 
difficult to reproduce. For this reason, the Kerr lab has established a more straightforward 
procedure called co-culture mimic in which an organism is cultured with a sterilized 
culture of another ecologically relevant organism. The three previously mentioned 
actinomycetes were subjected to ten different co-culture mimic conditions and their 
resulting secondary metabolism was analyzed using a similar method. Again, a list of 
putatively novel induced and upregulated compounds was generated for future discovery 
efforts. 
Lastly, the co-culture mimic experiments of another Kerr lab student highlighted 
the production of a putatively novel compound. Subsequent collaborative scale-up efforts 
followed by purification and structure elucidation revealed it was a novel 
biotransformation product which was named PQS-GlcA. The discovery of this compound 
unveiled a new anti-quorum sensing mechanism which may find a useful application in 
the development of new therapeutics targeting bacterial infections in humans.

1.1. NATURAL PRODUCTS 
1.1.1. What is a natural product? 
 
Molecules that are produced by living organisms which are not required for the 
sustenance of life can be referred to as secondary metabolites, or natural products 1. The 
relatively small compounds (> 3000 Da) are produced from primary metabolites by a 
broad range of living species from unicellular microorganisms to plants, insects and even 
mammals. Though at first the reasons for the production of these compounds were 
unclear, it is now understood that the biosynthesis of natural products affords an 
ecological and thus evolutionary advantage to the organism 2. These compounds possess 
diverse and intricate structures; this structural complexity has inherently resulted in a vast 
scope of biological activities which have a plethora of applications. Based on their 
structural features arising from distinct biosynthetic origins, natural products can be 
sorted into four main classes. 
 
Terpenoids represent the largest class of natural products. Their biosynthesis can 
begin from two separate pathways; the mevalonate pathway and the desoxyxylulose 
phosphate pathway 3. Both pathways produce the activated five-carbon isoprene units 
dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAP) and isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP). These units can 
link together to form longer chains and subsequently undergo cyclizations, 
rearrangements and other modifications such as oxidations or glycosylations. Depending 
on the number of isoprene units they contain, terpenes may be further classified as 
hemiterpenes (one unit, C5), monoterpenes (two units, C10), sesquiterpenes (three units, 
C15), diterpenes (four units, C20), sesterterpenes (five units, C25), triterpenes (six units, 
C30) or tetraterpenes (eight units, C40). Some examples of terpenoids include the 

3 
 
monoterpene limonene, the sesquiterpene parthenolide, and the diterpene pseudopterosin 
(Figure 1.1).  
Alkaloids, another large class of natural products, are typically nitrogen-
containing heterocyclic compounds derived from amino acids. Despite being derived 
from amino acids, these metabolites are not peptides. Within this class there are many 
subgroups that are used to further describe the thousands of compounds labeled as 
alkaloids. Some examples include benzylisoquinone alkaloids including the analgesic 
drugs morphine and codeine produced from two equivalents of tyrosine 4. Quinolizidine 
alkaloids originate from lysine and include the natural product lupinine, produced as a 
chemical defense mechanism in the lupin plant 5. The illegal drug cocaine is a tropane 
alkaloid which, like all tropane alkaloids, contains the bicyclic tropane ring that can be 
formed from ornithine and arginine 6. The most common amino acid building blocks and 
structures of these compounds are shown in Figure 1.2.

Polyketides, which include the cholesterol lowering agent lovastatin and the 
antibiotics tetracycline and erythromycin (Figure 1.3), are produced via multifunctional 
enzymes called polyketide synthases (PKSs). Their chemical structures can be extremely 
diverse despite mostly containing repeating units of malonate or methylmalonate which 
are used as building blocks to create a long polyketide chain. The use of different starter 
units such as para-aminobenzoic acid or β-alanine can also contribute to structural 
diversity. Though they are biosynthesized through very similar pathways, the retention of 
oxygen-containing functionalities is what sets polyketides apart from fatty acids. There 
are currently three known types of PKSs. Type I PKSs contain several modules, each 
with its own set of protein domains which are used to complete one round of polyketide 
chain elongation 7. Type II PKSs contain multiple enzymes in a large complex that 
harbour one set of domains which are used iteratively to lengthen the chain 8. Type III 
PKSs are homodimeric and work in an iterative fashion, independent of the acyl carrier 
protein that is used to activate substrates in type I and II PKSs 8. Once the polyketide 
chain is released from the PKS, additional structural features may arise via post-PKS 
tailoring steps that utilize enzymes such as oxygenases, methyltransferases, 
aminotransferases, glycosyltransferases and so on 9. 
 
Finally, non-ribosomal peptides are composed of amino acids connected by 
peptide linkages. In contrast to proteins, non-ribosomal peptides are relatively small and 
are not produced using the ribosome but rather using non-ribosomal peptide synthetases 
(NRPSs). Like in polyketide biosynthesis, there are three types of NRPSs that act 
similarly to the three types of PKSs 10. In addition to the proteinogenic amino acid 
building blocks used by NRPSs to produce the final natural product, non-ribosomal 

7 
 
peptides often contain non-proteinogenic amino acids. Tailoring steps can occur to add 
structural features such as sugars, hydroxyl groups and methyl groups 11. Interestingly, 
there are some natural products that contain both polyketide and non-ribosomal peptide 
moieties. Examples of well known non-ribosomal peptides include penicillin, gramicidin 
and vancomycin (Figure 1.4).

1.1.2. Sources and ecological functions of natural products 
 
Organisms from all six kingdoms of life are able to produce natural products. The 
structures of natural products are often complex and are energetically expensive for the 
producing organism to biosynthesize. For this reason, it was hypothesized that natural 
products must provide some sort of advantage to the producer, rather than simply being a 
waste product or a nonfunctional byproduct 1. With the rise of the field of chemical 
ecology, the specific functions of some secondary metabolites have become apparent 12. 
Organisms that lack an immune system or some kind of physical protection are often 
found to produce compounds that provide a chemical defense mechanism 12, 13. There are 
also examples of natural products used by predatory species 14. Furthermore, many 
natural products are used as intra- and interspecies chemical signals or as scavengers 
which can supply the producer with vital nutrients in an environment that is nutritionally 
deficient 15. Despite what is currently understood about the reasons some of these 
compounds are biosynthesized, the ecological roles of many natural products remain 
unknown. 
Many of the natural products known today come from plants. These compounds 
are often produced to defend the plant against herbivores, insects and microbial 
pathogens. Mentioned earlier, quinolizidines such as lupinine have a bitter taste which 
makes the lupin plant less desirable for consumption by herbivores than sweet lupins bred 
to be alkaloid-free 5. The pepper family (Piperaceae) can produce dihydropiperine which 
is acutely toxic to insects that feed on the plant 16. The cyclic triterpine ursolic acid is 
found in the plant Mirabilis jalapa as well as many herbs and fruits such as apples and 
cranberries. It was found to inhibit plant-associated biofilm formation of both Gram-

11 
 
positive and Gram-negative bacteria 17. As a final example, the daisy family (Asteraceae) 
can produce more than 750 natural products, the majority of which exhibit phototoxicity 
effects toward both insects and fungal pathogens 16. Some insects have adapted to toxic 
metabolites and have found ways to utilize them in their own life cycles. The giant 
butterfly Idea leuconoe acquires a plant alkaloid while it feeds on leaves in its larval 
stage; once in its adult stage the male performs a biotransformation of this compound to 
produce sex pheromones that attract females (Figure 1.5) 18. In addition to using these 
compounds in their own defense, natural products are also produced by plants to attract 
pollinators facilitating their reproduction 18. The role of natural products in the world of 
plant chemical ecology is instrumental and extends far beyond these few examples.

products. A toxic alkaloid produced by a plant is accumulated in the body of a male 
butterfly in its larval stage. The male performs a biotransformation and utilizes the 
resulting compounds as sex pheromones to attract females. Figure created by R. Nishidia, 
2014 18. 
 
 
 
 
 
 

13 
 
Natural products are also produced in other terrestrial organisms. Many species, 
insects in particular, use their own secondary metabolites as pheromones to communicate 
with their colonies or alarm them of danger 19. Reptiles such as lizards and snakes, and 
even mammals such as shrews and the duckbilled platypus produce venoms which help 
them hunt prey 20. In the marine environment, the slow-moving cone snail hunts fish with 
the help of a paralyzing neurotoxin 14. Similar to plants, sessile sponges and corals and 
other invertebrates in the marine environment that lack physical protection from 
predators are known to produce many defensive compounds. Natural products have also 
been isolated from larger marine animals such as squalamine which comes from the 
dogfish shark 21.  
 
Ubiquitous in the environment, microorganisms have been an important source of 
natural products since the discovery of penicillin by Alexander Fleming 22. Many 
microbes can secrete antibiotic or antifungal compounds in order to protect themselves 
against surrounding pathogenic microorganisms and compete for space and resources 23, 
24. The relatively new concept of quorum sensing, a regulatory system used by bacteria to 
communicate with themselves and their microbial neighbours involves production of 
natural products used as autoinducers and interspecies chemical signals 25. 
Microorganisms (and plants) can also produce antifouling compounds that can inhibit the 
formation of microbial biofilms or attachment of plants or animals to the surface of the 
producer 26. Interestingly, some natural products that were assumed to originate from a 
plant or animal source have turned out to be biosynthesized by a fungal or bacterial 
symbiont 27, 28. 
 

14 
 
1.1.3. Applications of natural products 
 
Natural products have been used to benefit human health since the beginning of 
traditional medicine. Some of the earliest records describe the use of the oils from many 
plant species to treat a variety of ailments from a simple cold to parasitic infections and 
inflammation 29. Fast forward to modern medicine and natural products remain an 
invaluable source of new drugs, as technology has allowed us to look at natural sources 
of healing at the molecular level. In 2015, the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was 
awarded to the discoverers of the avermectins and artemisinin. The avermectins were 
purified from cultures of the soil-dwelling bacterium Streptomyces avermitilis. A small 
chemical modification produced ivermectin which has nearly eradicated river blindness 
and elephantitis, two diseases caused by parasitic worms (Figure 1.6 A) 30. The 
exploitation of ancient Chinese medicine for novel anti-malarial therapies led to the 
discovery of artemisinin from the medicinal plant Artemisia annua which has saved 
hundreds of thousands of lives in malaria infected parts of the world (Figure 1.6 B) 30. 
These are only two examples; the structural complexity and diversity of natural products 
give rise to a great deal of biological activity which can be used to treat a range of other 
health issues including but not limited to bacterial and fungal infections, Alzheimer’s 
disease, cardiovascular disease and many types of cancer 31.

A recent survey of the sources of all small-molecule FDA-approved drugs from 
1981-2014 has highlighted the importance of natural products in drug discovery (Figure 
1.7) 32. Of the 1211 approved small-molecule drugs, 35% were purely synthetic (S) while 
only 6% were true natural products (N). Though this seems to suggest natural products 
play only a nominal role in drug discovery, the categories that make up the remaining 
59% of drugs are directly related to natural products. These categories include natural 
product derivatives (ND, 26%), botanical drugs (defined mixture) (NB, 1%), synthetic 
drugs that mimic a natural product (S/NM, 14%), synthetic drugs with a natural product 
pharmacophore (S*, 5%) and synthetic drugs with a pharmacophore that is a mimic of a 
natural product (S*/NM, 13%) 32. In summary, these findings convey the important 
influence that nature has had on human health whether through the use of natural 
products themselves, or the design and synthesis of natural product-inspired drugs. 
 
In addition to the pharmaceutical industry, natural products have also found 
application in the cosmeceutical and personal care industries. Less stringent testing 
requirements have made for a more rapid and facile process for getting a natural product 
to market than the clinical trials needed for approval as a drug. As active ingredients in 
anti-aging formulations, these products can be advertised as “natural” feeding into the 
current demand for organic products. There is a current trend of using marine natural 
products in cosmeceutical formulations, and in 2014 there were seven marine-derived 
natural product ingredients on the market 33. Other applications of natural products 
include environmentally friendly antifouling paint to inhibit the settlement of barnacles 
and algae on surfaces submerged in water 34 and natural pesticides for crop protection 35, 
among others.

that mimics a natural product, S*-synthetic compound with a natural product 
pharmacophore and S*/NM-synthetic compound with a natural product pharmacophore

1.1.4. Current challenges in natural product discovery 
 
One of the biggest threats currently facing human health is antibiotic-resistant 
bacteria. Increasingly common, infections by these superbugs are nearly impossible to 
treat with existing antibiotics. While we are currently experiencing a void in the 
discovery of novel antibiotics, new bacterial resistance mechanisms are being described 
on a regular basis which is leading to a global health crisis 36. Figure 1.8 shows a timeline 
of the emergence of new classes of antibiotics 37. The high rate of discovery from 1940-
1960 has been termed the “Golden Age” of antibiotic discovery and occurred largely in 
part of the screening of many natural products, particularly microbial ones 37. After this 
period, the rate of discovery dwindled as the easy-to-attain metabolites or the “low-
hanging fruit” had already been picked leading to the discovery void that has been 
present since the 1980s. This discovery void, among numerous other reasons, has lead to 
the termination of natural product programs at large pharmaceutical companies despite a 
dire need for antibiotics. However, while the pharmaceutical industry invested in new 
rational drug design technologies, advancements in natural product research has 
addressed some of the issues of the past and now-declining pharmaceutical companies 
may start to turn back to natural products 38.

discovery void that has been present since the 1980’s. Figure created by L. L. Silver,

20 
 
An important issue facing natural product discovery programs is the accidental 
rediscovery of known compounds which wastes time and resources. This tends to occur 
when using bioassay-guided fractionation methods; samples are tested for activity, 
fractionated and then tested again, continuing until the active compound has been 
isolated. Too often, lots of time and resources are spent on this process and then structure 
determination reveals a compound that has previously been reported. To combat this, 
various dereplication techniques have been established. Dereplication, which has evolved 
in several different ways since its inception, is a process which attempts to improve the 
performance of natural product screening by rapidly identifying known chemical entities 
and by organizing data for prioritization of target compounds for further purification 
efforts 39, 40. One way this can be achieved is using liquid chromatography-mass 
spectrometry (LC-MS) or nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy based 
metabolomics techniques coupled with a comparison of compound features to existing 
libraries and databases 39, 41. The resdiscovery of previously described metabolites can 
also be avoided by sampling from underexplored environments as biodiversity is 
correlated with chemodiversity. Bioprospecting in extreme environments such as the 
Polar regions or hard to reach marine niches has shown that these habitats are untapped 
sources of new natural products 42, 43, 44. Furthermore, advances in genome mining 
technology has facilitated the prediction of which metabolites may be produced by an 
organism, guiding researchers in the direction of new compounds before any chemical 
extractions begin 45, 46. Genetic information has also exposed the concept of cryptic 
natural products which will be discussed in Chapter 1.3. 

21 
 
 
The time-consuming nature of natural product drug discovery programs has also 
proven to be a challenge. Automated high-throughput screening for the early 
identification of putatively novel and bioactive metabolites has been an important 
solution in speeding up the overall process however it is a costly one. Downstream, 
difficulties in purification and structure elucidation of new compounds are bottlenecks in 
the discovery process, though high-resolution instrumentation has helped and automated 
isolation and structure elucidation technologies are emerging 39. Once target compounds 
are isolated, the overall yields can often be extremely poor and a lack of material for any 
substantial biological testing is a common problem. As potential drugs make their way 
through the pipeline to approval, increasing quantities are required for pre-clinical and 
clinical trials. Synthesis or semi-synthesis may offer a solution however a complex 
structure could complicate these efforts. If synthesis is not an option, supply can become 
an issue. When drugs come from plant or animal sources, harvesting enough of the 
organism to provide sufficient quantities may call into question the impact on 
environmental sustainability raise ethical issues 47. For this reason and others that will be 
discussed in the next section, the use of microorganisms as a source of natural products 
has been extremely important for drug discovery.  
1.2. MICROBIAL NATURAL PRODUCTS 
1.2.1. Benefits of using microbes as a source of natural products 
 
Of approximately 500 000 natural products that have been described, only 10% 
are of microbial origin 48. However, looking only at biologically active natural products, 
47% of all known microbial natural products are active while only 7% and 3% of plant 
and animal derived compounds exhibit bioactivity, respectively 48. Furthermore, 0.6% of 

22 
 
those bioactive microbial metabolites have been developed as drugs compared to only 
0.03% of plant and 0.001% animal bioactives 48. Despite the relatively small quantity of 
natural products from microorganisms that have been described, these numbers 
emphasize their value in the context of human health. The bioactivity of their secondary 
metabolites is just one of the reasons that microorganisms are quickly becoming a 
preferred source when searching for novel, active compounds. 
 
The use of microorganisms as a source of natural products provides a solution to 
the supply issue. Ubiquitous in nature, they can be isolated from samples collected almost 
anywhere in the world. After being collected only once, they can be stored indefinitely 
and fermented on large scales to provide a continuous and sustainable supply of 
metabolites. Large libraries of isolates can be built over time and kept in the laboratory. It 
is estimated that more the 95% of the bacterial species on Earth have not yet been 
cultured in a laboratory and thus a very miniscule fraction of microbial species have been 
evaluated for natural product production 49. With some species having the genetic 
capability of producing up to 50 secondary metabolites 49, microbes represent an 
extremely untapped resource of novel chemicals. The ability to quickly and easily 
sequence the whole genome of microorganisms allows insight into the metabolites they 
can produce. Natural product biosynthetic gene clusters can be cloned into the genomes 
of microbes that are easier to work with 50. Genetic engineering can also be used to 
manipulate the production of different analogues designed for improved bioactivity, 
eliminating the need for chemical modification 50.  
 

23 
 
1.2.2. Actinomycetes as a source of bioactive natural products 
 
Some microorganisms are better known for their production of bioactive 
compounds than others. Fungi are responsible for the production of about 45% of all 
bioactive microbial metabolites while bacteria from the order Actinomycetales of the 
phylum Actinobacteria account for about 39% 48. Actinomycetes are Gram-positive 
filamentous bacteria that are commonly present in soil environments all over the world. 
Of all actinomycetes, species of the genus Streptomyces have been the most prolific 
producers and the source of about two-thirds of all clinically used antibiotics 51. 
Tetracycline 52 vancomycin 53 and daptomycin 54 are all examples of streptomycete-
derived antibiotics. This genus has also produced compounds used for the treatment of 
other medical issues such as doxorubicin and bleomycin for multiple types of cancer 55, 
rapamycin for the prevention of organ transplant rejection 56 or the previously discussed 
avermectins for parasitic infections 30. Clinically important drugs have also been 
produced by actinomycetes from other genera including antibiotics such as the rifamycins 
produced by Amycolatopsis spp. 57 and erythromycin from Saccharopolyspora erythaea 
31, or calicheamycin from Micromonospora echinospora which was used to treat a form 
of leukemia 58. 
 
One strategy used by drug discovery programs to increase the odds of finding 
novel natural products is looking to rare actinomycete genera as producers. Species of 
rare genera are isolated less frequently than others when using conventional methods and 
therefore are relatively underexplored for new chemistry 59. One such genus is 
Kitasatospora 60. A very close relative of Streptomyces, Kitasatospora spp. are able to 
produce many of the same natural products and possesses many of the same genetic and 

24 
 
morphological characteristics 61. There has been much debate as to the classification of 
this genus; Kitasatospora was merged with Streptomyces ten years after its initial 
description 62 but was subsequently differentiated once more just five years later 63. 
Kitasatospora spp. are known to produce metabolites of all four main structural classes 
including the originally streptomycete-derived metabolites streptonigrin and bafilomycin 
as well as the Kitasatospora specific compounds setamycin and cystargin 59. More 
recently, cystargamide 64 and the cystargolides 65 have been purified and characterized in 
our laboratory from Kitasatospora cystarginea, further validating the use of rare 
actinomycetes, specifically of the Kitasatospora genus, for the discovery of novel natural 
products. 
1.2.3. Polyether ionophore natural products 
 
One interesting group of bioactive metabolites that are produced by actinomycetes 
is the polycyclic polyether ionophores. These compounds are type I polyketides that 
always feature a carboxylic acid moiety, several tetrahydrofuran and tetrahydropyran 
rings and numerous hydroxyl and methyl groups 66. Many structures possess spiroketal 
and cyclic hemiketal functionalities. Some structures contain ketone functional groups, 
and more uncommonly, amino acid and aromatic moieties. Over 120 polyether 
ionophores have been described 66, 67 with the majority of structure elucidation completed 
via X-ray diffraction analysis prior to the 2000’s. Some structurally diverse examples 
include alborixine, calcimycin and lasalocid (Figure 1.9).  Polyether ionophores are 
produced by only a handful of genera including mostly Streptomyces and Actinomadura 
spp., as well as some species of Actinomyces, Dactylosporangium, Nocardia and 
Nocardiopsis 68. Though this class of compounds was first recognized in 1967, the 

25 
 
biosynthetic pathways that produce them have remained elusive. Generally, as for all type 
I PKSs, a polyketide chain is produced through a number of chain elongation steps with 
different extender units, and the required stereospecific reduction occurs generating the 
polyketide skeleton. In each of the few polyether biosynthetic pathways that have been 
described thus far, post-PKS tailoring steps involve epoxidation of double bonds on the 
polyketide chain via stereospecific epoxidase enzymes 68, 69. The ether rings are then 
formed via an epoxide-opening cascade reaction catalyzed by epoxide hydrolases 70.

diverse structures. The crystal structures of various metal complexes of each compound 
are also shown. The crystal structures were obtained from the Cambridge Structural 
Database.  
 
 
 
 
 

27 
 
 
Because of their unique structures, these compounds are able to act as ionophores. 
In the simplest terms, ionophores are molecules which reversibly bind ions and transport 
them across a cell membrane. Polyethers are able to form complexes with both 
monovalent and divalent metal cations; the metal can coordinate to etheric and hydroxyl 
oxygen atoms as well as nitrogen atoms within the structure 66, 67. In order to coordinate 
in this way, the polyether must adopt a three-dimensional conformation whereby it is 
wrapped around the metal 67. The resulting pseudocyclic structure, often stabilized by a 
few intramolecular hydrogen bonds, houses the metal in a cage-like hydrophilic inner-
sphere 67. Consequently, the alkyl backbone of the polyether makes up the outer-sphere 
causing the entire complex to be effectively hydrophobic 67. This property is what allows 
polyethers to penetrate cellular membranes resulting in tremendous biological activity. 
There are three mechanisms in which this can occur. Electroneutral transport (Figure 1.10 
A) involves binding of the polyether anion (I-COO-) to either a metal cation (M+) or a 
proton (H+) forming a neutral complex which can diffuse across the cell membrane 71. 
The relatively alkaline cellular environment facilitates this type of transport through the 
deprotonation of the acid moiety on the ionophore 71. In electrogenic transport (Figure 
1.10 B), the polyether remains protonated and metal complexation occurs with the neutral 
ionophore 71. This recently described mechanism is important when studying the effect of 
polyether ionophores on cancerous cells as the microenvironment of cancer cells is 
known to be acidic 71, 72. Lastly, biomimetic transport (Figure 1.10 C) occurs with 
synthetically modified polyethers containing ester or amide groups rather than carboxylic 
acids 71. In all three mechanisms, the general overall result is a change in the Na+/K+ 

28 
 
gradient within the cell which causes an increase in osmotic pressure and swelling 
leading to cell death 67.

30 
 
The ionophore properties of polyethers have afforded them a range of bioactivity 
however they are most well known for being excellent antibiotics. The complexes can 
easily cross Gram-positive cell membranes making them effective for treatment of 
various Gram-positive bacterial infections 73. Their potency against drug resistant strains 
such as vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) and methicillin-resistant Staphyloccocus 
aureus (MRSA) is superior to the classically used antibiotics vancomycin and oxacillin 
with minimal inhibitory concentrations in the low nanomolar range 74. Most, but not all 
polyethers are ineffective against Gram-negative bacteria as they are unable to penetrate 
the lipopolysaccharide outer membrane 67, 73. Three compounds in particular, septamycin 
75, noboritomycin 76 and mutalomycin 77 are able to inhibit growth of Gram-negative 
pathogens at nanomolar concentrations. Fungal pathogens are more resistant to polyether 
ionophores, however some species are moderately sensitive to treatment 73. Parasitic 
infections are very susceptible to treatment by polyethers. Half-maximal inhibitory 
concentrations of a number of polyethers including monensin, salinomycin, nigericin, 
narasin and dianemycin against chloroquine-resistant strains of the malaria-causing 
parasite Plasmodium falciparum were in the picomolar range 78, 79. Eimeria spp. are 
parasites that cause coccidosis in cattle and poultry and are also greatly affected by these 
ionophores 73. Polyether natural products have also shown promise for the treatment of 
viral infections, especially HIV 73. Effects of these compounds on the cardiovascular 80, 
immunoregulatory 81 and central nervous systems 82 have been explored, as well as their 
possible use as topical anti-inflammatory 83, herbicidal 84 and anti-scarring agents 85.  
 
Since the discovery of monensin in 1967, the anticancer activity of this family of 
compounds has barely been explored. Using nigericin as an example, the polyether 

31 
 
ionophores were mentioned as a potential new class of anticancer drugs in 1987 due to 
their ion exchange capabilities 86 but since then the majority of research has focused on 
their impressive antibiotic properties. In 2009, a large screening of 16 000 compounds for 
activity towards multi-drug resistant cancer cells and cancer stem cells highlighted 
salinomycin as having potent and selective activity which has since prompted an 
exponential increase of research on these compounds 87. Thus far, studies have suggested 
that different polyethers have specific modes of action against different types of cancers. 
Salinomycin was found to activate a specific apoptotic pathway 88 while nigericin 
completely stops DNA synthesis by increasing intracellular pH 89, both while having a 
negligible effect on cells of healthy tissues. Polyethers have also been reported to have 
selective chemosensitizing properties; they increase the sensitivity of cancer cells to 
clinically used chemotherapy agents when administered together, but do not affect 
sensitivity to healthy cells 71, 73. A number of polyethers are currently being evaluated for 
development as anticancer drugs. Salinomycin has been the most thoroughly explored to 
date and has seen success in pilot clinical trials for a number of cancer types 90.    
 
Several polyether ionophores have been developed for the veterinary industry and 
are used worldwide. In 2012, lasalocid (Avatec®, Bovatec®), laidlomycin (Cattlyst®), 
maduramycin (Cygro®), narasin (Monteban®, Maxiban®), semduramycin (Aviax®), 
monensin (Coban®, Rumensin®, Coxidin®) and salinomycin (Biocox®, Sacox®) were 
marketed as antibiotics and anticoccidial agents for ruminants and poultry 71. So far, no 
polyethers have been tested for use as antibiotics in humans due to their observed 
cytotoxicity in some mammals 71. Only one case of acute human overexposure has been 
recorded which involved accidental inhalation and swallowing resulting in prolonged 

32 
 
weakness and pain in the extremities that was resolved after 40 days 91. More recently, the 
effects of long-term low-dose exposure has revealed some negative chronic effects 92. 
Development of these compounds as cancer therapeutics will shed more light on human 
toxicity although so far the low doses used in pilot clinical trials have shown minimal 
side effects 90. Produced in large quantities by actinomycetes, polyether ionophores do 
not face any supply issues, and total synthesis of many members of this family has been 
described 93, 94. Looking ahead, genetic screening methods are being developed in the 
quest to discover new polyether natural products 68. 
1.2.4. The role of natural products and their biotransformations in quorum sensing  
 
Quorum sensing is a form of bacterial communication. Some species of both 
Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria can biosynthesize and secrete secondary 
metabolites that act as self-signals, or autoinducers (AIs) that increase in concentration as 
the bacterial cell density increases 25. When a minimum concentration of an AI is detected 
by the bacterium it leads to changes in gene expression which allows behavioural 
coordination of the entire bacterial population 25. Figure 1.11 shows a generic diagram of 
quorum sensing in Gram-negative bacteria 95. Here, the AIs are biosynthesized and 
secreted from the cell. When the extracellular concentration of AIs reaches a specific 
threshold they are detected by the cell through binding to a cognate receptor. The 
complex then binds to a promoter which activates gene expression. The overall result is 
gene regulation through quorum sensing. This phenomenon was first described in 
bioluminescent marine bacterium Vibrio fischeri that is present at high cell densities 
inside eukaryotic hosts like squid and fish. When a culture of this species is trapped 
inside of the host, it grows to a very high cell density while releasing an AI that signals 

33 
 
the emission of light which affords an ecological advantage to the host 96. Quorum 
sensing can orchestrate a number of activities and virulence factors such as motility, 
sporulation, antibiotic production and biofilm formation which contribute to the 
pathogenicity of the bacterium 25.

Currently, treatment of bacterial infections in humans and animals usually 
involves administering antibiotics which will inhibit the growth of the pathogen. As 
previously discussed, the lack of new antibiotic classes being discovered coupled with a 
growing number of resistance mechanisms has left society facing global health crisis. The 
existence of quorum sensing systems that regulate the expression of virulence factors has 
presented a new opportunity for treatment of infections 97. Targeting and blocking the 
regulators of bacterial virulence can diminish the organism’s ability to establish itself in a 
host thus eliminating the need for antibiotics 97. Inhibiting the production of AIs, 
modifying them so they are not recognized by their receptor, or competitively binding to 
their receptor are three ways in which this can occur 95. Quorum sensing antagonists can 
be either synthetic compounds or natural products. In addition, quorum sensing inhibition 
through enzymatic modification of AIs has occurred in co-cultures of two different 
microbes where the AIs were hypothesized to have some sort of negative effect on the 
foreign species 98. It has been postulated that attenuation of virulence factors to eliminate 
infections will be less likely to facilitate the development of resistance mechanisms 97, 98, 
making this an attractive approach to treating bacterial infections. 
 In patients with cystic fibrosis, infection of the lungs with the Gram-negative 
pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa is very common. Infections are complicated by the 
fact that one of the virulence factors of the pathogen is biofilm formation. The formation 
of a biofilm provides an ideal, protected environment where the bacterial population is 
able to resist the action of antibiotics 99 making these infections very difficult to treat 
using conventional methods. The development of therapeutics based on quorum sensing 

36 
 
inhibition mechanisms, particularly through enzymatic modification of secreted 
autoinducers, is a topic of current investigation 97, 98, 99.  
1.3. CRYPTIC NATURAL PRODUCTS 
1.3.1. Cryptic natural products and their importance 
 
Though the “Golden Age” of natural product discovery is behind us, some may 
say we are on the cusp of a second “Golden Age”. Genomic sequencing technology has 
opened a new door in natural product discovery which has led to the exciting new world 
of cryptic metabolites. The genome of Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) was published in 
2002 100, revealing not only the biosynthetic gene clusters responsible for the production 
of known metabolites, but also genes which encoded metabolites that had never been 
observed from this bacterium 100, 101, 102. These seemingly inactive biosynthetic gene 
clusters and the metabolites that they encode can be referred to as silent or cryptic. 
Accessing these elusive compounds is important as novel chemistry will reveal novel 
bioactivity. The discovery of cryptic natural products may lead to new effective 
anticancer drugs or new structural classes of antibiotics which is desperately needed in 
present times.  
 
Fungal cryptic natural products have been explored to some extent 102, while 
methods for activating silent biosynthetic pathways in bacteria are still being developed. 
A streptomycete genome may reveal 20-30 natural product encoding biosynthetic genes 
100, yet fermentation under standard laboratory conditions typically results in just two or 
three natural products. If cryptic metabolites are produced, their quantities may fall below 
the detection limits of instrumentation used to identify them. If they are detected, there is 

37 
 
often not enough of the compound for purification and structure elucidation, even in 
large-scale cultures. Though genomic information sheds light on the presence of cryptic 
natural products, it does not directly convey how to upregulate or induce their production 
and therefore a number of different approaches are often attempted blindly. This has 
fortuitously resulted in the successful discovery of new cryptic natural products however 
alternatively, in silico genetic data mining can provide a more informed estimate of 
conditions likely to activate silent gene clusters.  An example of this can be found in the 
induction and purification of coelichelin, one of the cryptic natural products from the 
previously mentioned S. coelicolor 103. Analysis of the silent gene cluster predicted that it 
was responsible for the production of a tripeptide, which based on its structure could be a 
siderophore. Culturing the bacterium in an iron-deficient medium activated the 
coelichelin gene cluster and produced the target compound in sufficient quantities for 
purification. Structure elucidation revealed the compound was actually a tetrapeptide 
which highlighted a pitfall in the accuracy of this approach 102. Researchers have been 
continuing to utilize this technology for the rapid identification and isolation of cryptic 
natural products, and it seems genetic mining, or genomics, is the key to success for 
cryptic natural product discovery of the future. When combined with advanced structure 
prediction informatics this approach becomes extremely powerful 104. This being said, 
whole genome sequencing of large microbial libraries is not always plausible and non-
specific methods of cryptic natural product induction continue to successfully unveil new 
compounds.   
 
 

38 
 
1.3.2. Traditional methods to access cryptic natural products 
 
Induction of cryptic metabolites in a defined set of growth conditions was 
observed even before genome sequencing was a possibility. The biosynthesis of natural 
products is energetically expensive. At any given time, under a certain set of conditions, 
it is unlikely that an organism will spend energy producing each and every secondary 
metabolite it is genetically capable of 102. Instead, natural products are produced only 
when needed in response to environmental situations, ultimately providing an advantage 
to the organism under the specific conditions 102. High concentrations of phosphates or 
the addition of certain amino acids has been proposed to induce the production of 
previously unobserved metabolites 105. Furthermore, antibiotic production is more 
commonly encountered when using a lean growth medium relatively low in nutrients as 
opposed to rich media. Aside from altering the composition of the culture growth media, 
the sudden onset of environmental stress during fermentation has produced interesting 
results. One good example is the induction of the jadomycins by Streptomyces venezuelae 
ISP5230 106. Jadomycin, a pigmented antibiotic, was discovered after an incubator 
malfunction caused the temperature to increase and turned cultures black in colour. It was 
found that the production of an analogue, jadomycin B, could be induced in response to a 
heat shock or by the addition of ethanol to cultures 107. Further optimization experiments 
found an ideal concentration and time of addition of ethanol to yield the highest titers of 
the jadomycin B 107. In addition, it was observed that the addition of different amino acids 
lead to the production of different analogues 107.  
 
Examples of natural product induction that existed in the literature before the new 
millennium were mostly the result of serendipitous discoveries arising from random 

39 
 
alteration of the growth medium or culture conditions. In 2002, the idea of screening a 
relatively small library of microbes in a relatively large number of conditions was 
presented and termed the “one strain-many compounds” (OSMAC) approach 105. Though 
still mostly randomized in terms of what conditions will be tested, this approach is more 
systematic and thorough. At the time this concept was introduced, it had been used by its 
inventors to successfully isolate over 100 natural products from only six producing 
organisms, demonstrating its impressive effectiveness 105. This is because the OSMAC 
approach is not geared towards activation of one specific cryptic gene cluster as is the 
case for a genomics-based approach targeting one specific metabolite. By systematically 
varying parameters such as the culture vessel size and shape, fermentation volume, 
aeration, length and temperature, medium components and pH, or addition of chemical 
probes, the OSMAC approach is simple, inexpensive and leads to big changes in 
secondary metabolism. The ability of the organism to grow in the conditions to be tested 
is a limitation of this technique, however the infinite number of conditions that could be 
attempted is surely a strength. 
 
Since its inception, the OSMAC approach has been used to upregulate and induce 
the production of novel cryptic metabolites from Streptomyces spp. One example is the 
discovery of the new ansamycin compound chaxamycin and the structurally rare 
polyketide chaxalactin from Streptomyces sp. C34 isolated from desert soil (Figure 1.12) 
102, 108. Initial fermentation in standard ISP2 broth afforded chaxamycin A and B, while a 
modified ISP2 recipe using glycerol instead of glucose produced chaxamycin C and D. 
Fermentation of the strain in eight more liquid media revealed three analogues of 
chaxalactin which were produced in connection with the presence of glycerol. 

40

Chaxamycin A and B were produced by Streptomyces sp. C34 under standard laboratory 
culturing conditions while chaxamycin C and D, and chaxalactin A-C were induced using 
various modified media 108. 
 
 
 
 

41 
 
 
1.3.3. Co-culture methods to access cryptic natural products 
 
In nature, microorganisms exist in constant interaction with other living species 
including other microbes, plants and animals in both terrestrial and marine environments. 
The relationship between microbes and other species may be symbiotic, for example a 
bacterium that lives within a coral that provides chemical defense in exchange for a 
habitat that provides ideal nutrition 109. Alternatively, the relationships may be 
antagonistic which occurs in complex microbial communities that house many species 
competing for space and resources. The ecological stress within these microbiomes 
provokes a great deal of natural product production; antimicrobial metabolites and other 
chemical signals such as quorum sensing AIs are released into the environment and in 
turn can stimulate gene expression in other microbes 110. For this reason, it is 
hypothesized that the production of cryptic metabolites can be induced in the laboratory 
by direct contact with one or more ecologically relevant “stressor” organisms and their 
chemical signals 110, 111. This co-culture induction approach has been used successfully 
many times with fungal-fungal, bacterial-bacterial, and fungal-bacterial cultures and 
some examples are shown in Table 1.1 111.   
 
 
 
 
 

42

Marmann et al., 2014 111. 
 

43 
 
Though this approach sounds relatively straightforward there are a number of 
decisions to be made in terms of how the experiments can be set up. Similar to random 
variation of fermentation conditions to induce new compounds, there is no standard way 
of conducting co-culture experiments. Stressor organisms can be chosen on the basis of 
ecological relevance in attempt to imitate an ecological situation, or they can be chosen 
on the basis of their pathogenicity in the hope that induced metabolites might have 
targeted activity towards the pathogen. Co-cultures can be performed on solid media or in 
liquid cultures. In liquid cultures, the microbes may be grown together or separated by a 
physical barrier such as dialysis tubing which allows diffusion of small metabolites into 
the opposing culture but avoids direct cell contact 112. Cell-free cultures of stressors may 
also be used 113. In some cases, such as the production of a red pigmented compound in a 
co-culture of Streptomyces lividans and Tsukamurella pulmonis, direct cell-to-cell contact 
was required 114. The addition of heat-killed cultures of a stressor to a pure culture of a 
live strain has also been a successful method; dead cultures of Bacillus subtilis and S. 
aureus added to S. coelicolor fermentations upregulated the production of 
undecylprodigiosin 115. More variables in these experiments include the media 
composition, as well as the time-point and concentrations in which the stressor is 
introduced to the live culture 116. 
 
The co-culture approach is further complicated by a number of inherent flaws. 
First, fermentation conditions are limited to those in which all of the involved organisms 
can thrive. In the case of fungal-bacterial interactions, finding ideal growth conditions for 
both organisms presents a challenge. Second, the growth rates of two or more organisms 
in the same conditions are very difficult to control which calls into question the 

44 
 
reproducibility of this approach. Reproducibility is particularly important when it comes 
time for scale-up in order to obtain sufficient material for purification of any identified 
cryptic natural products. Third, without genomic data for each strain used in the 
experiment, it would be very difficult to identify the true producer of any cryptic natural 
products discovered. Finally, purification of induced natural products from extracts of co-
cultures is extremely difficult as many more compounds complicate the metabolic profile.  
The Kerr group has attempted to address some of these issues with the advent of a 
somewhat simplified standard procedure, similar to the introduction of the more 
systematic OSMAC approach for varying culture conditions. A number of experimental 
set-ups were explored to find the most convenient, reproducible parameters tailored for 
co-culture experiments with actinomycetes. The approach, which has been termed “co-
culture mimic”, involves the fermentation of an actinomycete in a medium that has been 
conditioned with a standardized quantity of the dead cells and secreted biomolecules of a 
stressor organism. More simply, aliquots of a heat-killed culture are added to the broth of 
a live culture. A simple schematic of this approach is shown in Figure 1.13. LC-MS 
based metabolomics procedures for analyzing and visualizing the results of co-culture 
mimic experiments have been implemented. The secondary metabolite profiles of pure 
control cultures versus the stressor-added culture can be directly compared to rapidly 
highlight natural product upregulation or induction. With only one live culture, the 
approach is a “mimic” of a true co-culture using two live organisms. Working with only 
one live culture increases the reproducibility of the resulting metabolic profiles. A set of 
fermentation conditions that is ideal for the producer may be chosen without any regard 
for the stressor, and deducing the origin of any new natural products becomes trivial. 

45 
 
Optimization of the best stressor concentrations and addition time points have been 
attempted with some success however these details vary with the specific combination of 
producer and stressor being evaluated. Ideally, co-culture mimic experiments will also 
simplify the identification of the specific chemical signals, if any, that are responsible for 
activating silent gene clusters in the producer. The purified signaling compounds can then 
be applied directly to producer cultures for an even more reproducible source of the 
cryptic metabolite of interest. Thus far, the co-culture mimic approach has led to the 
identification of numerous putatively new, induced natural products. It has also led to the 
unveiling of a novel and important quorum sensing inhibition mechanism which will be 
presented in this thesis.

1.4. RESEARCH GOALS 
 
Overall, the main goal of this thesis was to identify, purify and characterize novel 
natural products produced by actinomycetes. Targeting cryptic natural products using 
well-established non-specific approaches increased the likelihood of achieving this goal. 
A small set of three actinomycetes were chosen on the basis of their reputation as being 
excellent producers of bioactive natural products. Working with a restricted set of 
actinomycetes, rather than a large library, increased the number of conditions that could 
be screened for each organism. This ultimately allowed the secondary metabolism of the 
three selected strains to be more thoroughly examined which is essential when searching 
for cryptic natural products. 
1.4.1. Examine the effect of varying culture media of natural product production 
 
The traditional approach of varying culture media to uncover cryptic natural 
products was applied to the three selected actinomycetes. A total of 14 different 
conditions were screened to increase the likelihood of achieving induction and finding 
new natural products. Chemical screening and dereplication via ultra high performance 
liquid chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC-HRMS) based 
metabolomics revealed many changes in the secondary metabolomes of the three 
bacterial strains and led to the discovery of two induced metabolites, one known and one 
new, which exhibited both antibiotic and anticancer activity. These results will be 
discussed in Chapter 2.1. For convenience, LC-MS will represent UHPLC-HRMS 
throughout this thesis. 
 

48 
 
1.4.2. Examine the effect of co-culture mimic conditions of natural product 
production 
 
Our newly developed co-culture mimic strategy was applied to the three selected 
actinomycetes in the continued search for novel, induced metabolites. A diverse group of 
stressors was chosen; the specific combinations had never before been explored thus 
increasing the chances of uncovering new metabolites. The effect of these conditions on 
natural product production was evaluated using LC-MS based metabolomics. The 
upregulation and induction of uncharacterized metabolites was catalogued and future 
work is suggested in Chapter 2.2.  
1.4.3. Purify and characterize putatively new compounds from induction 
experiments  
 
The co-culture mimic experiments of another student in the Kerr lab led to the 
identification of a compound that appeared to be induced, and the specific signal 
responsible for the induction was identified. In a collaborative effort, scaled-up 
fermentations were pursued. Purification and structure elucidation revealed the 
compound was not a natural product, but rather a novel biotransformation product related 
to quorum sensing activities. Purification and characterization of two additional 
metabolites was also achieved, one which exhibited upregulation in response to the 
specific chemical signal. The results of this collaborative project are presented in Chapter 
2.3.

2.1. THE EFFECTS OF VARYING CULTURE MEDIA ON NATURAL 
PRODUCT PRODUCTION AND THE DISCOVERY OF TERROSAMYCIN A 
AND B 
2.1.1. Introduction 
 
In an attempt to activate cryptic pathways and in turn, discover new induced 
compounds, the secondary metabolism of three actinomycetes was examined using an 
OSMAC approach. Two species of the rare genus Kitasatospora (K. cystarginea NRRL 
B-16505 and K. griseola NRRL B-16229) as well as Streptomyces sp. RKND004, a 
unique strain isolated from Prince Edward Island sediment, were selected for study in 
order to maximize the chances of uncovering novel structures. Each strain was subjected 
to fermentation in 14 different types of liquid media and the resulting metabolomes were 
examined and compared across the different conditions. Metabolites that appeared to be 
induced by certain media and had no or few exact mass matches within natural products 
databases were prioritized for scaled-up fermentation and isolation. This approach led to 
the discovery of natural products which we have termed the terrosamycins, a family of 
polyether natural products produced by our Prince Edward Island strain which exhibited 
excellent antibiotic and anticancer properties. 
2.1.2. Identification of Streptomyces sp. RKND004 
 
The actinomycete strain labeled RKND004 was isolated by the Kerr group from a 
sediment sample collected in August, 2010 in Burnt River, Prince Edward Island. 
Preliminary phylogenetic analysis via partial 16S rRNA gene sequencing at the time of 
isolation revealed the strain was possibly a Kitasatospora species. The rpoB and full-
length 16S rRNA gene sequences were used to further classify the bacterium. The rpoB 

51 
 
gene is a useful taxonomic marker for distinguishing between species of the closely 
related genera Kitasatospora and Streptomyces 117, while the 16S rRNA gene is 
commonly used in phylogenetic studies of bacteria as it is highly conserved among 
different species 118. 
The rpoB sequence (253 bp) was compared to existing nucleotide sequences in 
the NCBI database using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) 119. The 
BLAST search revealed one Kitasatospora and 26 Streptomyces strains with 96% 
similarity suggesting RKND004 likely belongs to the Streptomyces genus. A similar 
search compared the 16S rRNA sequence (1471 bp) to existing bacterial 16S rRNA 
sequences in the database. The 16S sequence showed over 97% similarity to 12 
Streptomyces strains, with 99% similarity to Streptomyces yanglinensis 1307 and 
Streptomyces paucisporeus 1412. The high degree of similarity between many 16S 
sequences within the genus Streptomyces render this technique unsuitable for 
differentiation at the species level 120, and thus the bacterium was identified as 
Streptomyces sp. RKND004.  
2.1.3. Small-scale fermentations and extractions 
 
 Each of the three actinomycetes (K. cystarginea, K. griseola and Streptomyces 
sp. RKND004) was fermented on a small scale in 14 different liquid media (Table 2.1) in 
triplicate. The different media types are commonly used in the Kerr lab and were selected 
based on their compositional diversity and potential to stimulate production of a range of 
natural products. Uninoculated media blanks for each media type were included as 
negative controls and subjected to the same fermentation conditions. Cultures and blanks 
were extracted with ethyl acetate and the extracts were analyzed using LC-MS over seven 

52 
 
batches of analysis. Each batch began with a reserpine sample as a retention time 
calibration standard as well as three methanol blanks to limit carryover between samples; 
one before and after the reserpine standard as well as one at the end of each batch.

2.1.4. Data analysis and prioritization of target compounds 
 
All raw LC-MS data were first inspected manually for any peaks that were 
present when the strain was grown in certain media and not in others, indicating the 
presence of a putatively induced metabolite. The specific strain and media producing 
putatively induced metabolites were noted however, due to the sheer volume of data, the 
software program MZmine 2 133 was employed as a data mining tool to assess the results 
in greater detail. The data for each strain was processed separately due to limitations on 
the number of files the program can handle at one time. 
Raw data was imported into MZmine 2 and processed in a similar manner as 
previously described by the Kerr group 41 with some additions. First, the mass detection 
intensity threshold was set to 1E4 to ensure that the m/z peaks detected were from 
genuine metabolites and not part of the noise. Chromatograms for each file were created 
and deconvoluted into individual peaks and low-intensity isotopes were removed. 
Normalization of the data within each sample was achieved using the maximum peak 
intensity method; the area of each peak within the sample was divided by the area of the 
largest peak within the same sample, allowing comparison of the production of any one 
metabolite relative to others in the same sample across each different condition screened. 
The lists of peaks present in each sample were joined into a single aligned peak list. Gap 
filling was performed in order to ensure the inclusion of peaks that may have been 
detected in some scans, but not in others, resulting in their undesired elimination from the 
list. After manual removal of peaks detected in the negative control, methanol blank and 
reserpine standard samples, a total of 174, 145 and 103 distinct mass features (each with 

57 
 
their own m/z, tR and peak area) remained for K. cystarginea, K. griseola and 
Streptomyces sp. RKND004 extracts, respectively. 
The resulting processed peak list was exported into Microsoft Excel resulting in a 
two-dimensional data matrix displaying the peak area of each defined mass feature in 
each sample. Using conditional formatting, cells in the spreadsheet containing a peak area 
greater than zero were coloured black, while those with an area equal to zero (i.e. not 
detected in that sample) were coloured white creating a presence-absence chemical 
barcode for each strain (Figure 2.1).  The barcodes were used as a tool to visualize 
metabolites exhibiting an induction effect which may be selected for further 
investigation.  

58 
 
 
Figure 2.1. Presence-absence chemical barcodes generated by metabolomic analysis of A. K. cystarginea (174 mass features), B. K. 
griseola (145 mass features) and C. Streptomyces sp. RKND004 (103 mass features). Columns represent different mass features with 
a distinct m/z and tR while rows represent different samples. Each barcode contains 42 rows; three replicates for each of the 14 media. 
Cells coloured in black indicate the presence of that mass feature in the sample above the defined mass detection threshold of 1E4. 
White cells indicate mass features that were not present above the 1E4 threshold. All three barcodes are shown for comparison and 
scaled to fit in one figure; cells from one barcode aligning in the same column as cells from another barcode do not indicate the 
presence of the same mass feature in both samples.

The barcode generated for K. griseola highlighted the presence of two features 
with a mass difference that suggested they may be analogues. The signals were located in 
the raw data (Xcalibur software, Thermo Scientific) and identified as the protonated 
adducts of two metabolites; m/z 542.3230 [M+H]+, tR 3.69 min and its apparent 
methylated analogue m/z 556.3386 [M+H]+, tR 3.86 min. Both compounds were produced 
in all replicates above the 1E4 threshold when the strain was grown in ISP2, BFM3, 
BFM4 and BFM14, while m/z 556.3386 [M+H]+ was also produced consistently above 
the threshold when the strain was grown in BFM2, and BFM9 (Figure 2.2). These 
metabolites had been previously observed by former Ph. D. candidate in our lab Dr. 
Krista Gill, who had grown the strain in a lean production medium called 1045. When 
queried in both the AntiBase 134 and SciFinder databases, the exact masses of these 
metabolites did not match any known natural products. Additionally, our lab had 
sequenced the strain’s genome and thus if the compounds were purified and their 
structures elucidated, it may be possible to attribute a gene cluster to their production. 
Thus, the compounds were prioritized for further investigation. Unfortunately all 
subsequent efforts to obtain these compounds via fermentation on multiple scales were 
unsuccessful as the strain produced either a very low quantity or none at all, and their 
identities were left undetermined.

threshold in all replicates when the bacterium was grown in ISP2, BFM3, BFM4 and 
BFM14, while m/z 556.3386 [M+H]+ was also produced using BFM2 and BFM9.

The barcode generated for the Prince Edward Island strain Streptomyces sp. 
RKND004 revealed the presence of a number of mass features with a similar m/z and tR 
that were detected above the threshold in the same set of conditions. Figure 2.3 shows an 
enlarged section of the barcode containing this family of relatively large molecular 
weight (m/z >700) pseudomolecular ions. Additionally, a large, broad peak corresponding 
to the presence of these compounds was observed in the LC-MS chromatograms for 
extracts of this strain grown only in certain media (Figure 2.4). Since natural products 
with large molecular weights have a higher likelihood of being novel, and since our 
unique Prince Edward Island strain had not yet been explored for natural product 
production, this family of compounds was prioritized for further study.

in ISP2, BFM3, BFM7, BFM10, BFM13 and BFM14.

The most abundant compound was identified by two pseudomolecular ions 
observed in the raw LC-MS data: m/z 830.5668 [M+NH4]+, tR 6.20 min and m/z 835.5186  
[M+Na]+, tR 6.20 min. To better visualize the induction effect, an ion intensity plot 
monitoring the intensity of the sodiated adduct was generated using MZmine 2 (Figure 
2.5). Since each extract was resuspended to a concentration of 500 μg/mL prior to 
analysis and the data normalized with respect to the largest peak within each individual 
sample, the ion intensity plot compares the production of the targeted compounds relative 
to other metabolites in the same sample across each of the different media screened. This 
approach does not take into account the actual mass of the metabolites present in the 
sample. Alternatively, resuspension of each extract in the same volume of methanol 
before analysis would have allowed a direct comparison of the quantity of each target 
produced between samples giving an idea of which condition physically produced the 
most. Using the latter method however, metabolites present in extracts with a small mass 
may have fallen below the detection threshold in the more dilute samples and been 
excluded from the peak lists. To ensure the inclusion of all metabolites, the first method 
of normalization was used and the mass of the extracts was considered in combination 
with the relative production of the targets when comparing different conditions.  

65

medium. The average mass of the extracts for each condition is shown for comparison.

66 
 
Figure 2.5 shows the peak area of m/z 835.5168 [M+Na]+, tR 6.20 min when the 
strain was grown in each of the different media. The compound was only present above 
the 1E4 mass detection threshold when Streptomyces sp. RKND004 was grown in ISP2, 
BFM3, BFM7, BFM10, BFM13 and BFM14. Extracted ion chromatograms (XICs) from 
the raw data monitoring the sodiated adduct confirmed that the compound was not 
present below the threshold in extracts from other media (except trace amounts in BFM8 
and BFM4), confirming a true induction took place (Appendix Figure 6.1). Since the 
analysis does not take into account the physical quantity of the compound present in each 
condition, the average mass of the extracts were also noted in Figure 2.5. Considering 
this, BFM7 was the best medium to facilitate the production of this compound, however 
the mass of BFM7 broth extracts was artificially large presumably due to the undesired 
extraction of olive oil present in the media. To avoid this issue, BFM3 was chosen for 
future scaled-up fermentations.  
In the raw data, the [M+H]+ adduct (m/z 813.5151, tR 6.20) was either absent or 
present at extremely low intensities. Lack of this signal suggested that the nature of the 
compound may cause the protonated adduct to be difficult to form, for example a 
compound containing an acid moiety. To confirm this, the samples were re-analyzed 
using an identical method with the instrument in negative mode which revealed m/z 
811.5205, tR 6.20 as the [M-H]-. A query of AntiBase and SciFinder returned only one 
match to a compound named N664-30, a polyether ionophore compound reported only 
once in the literature in a patent containing minimal data 135. Despite this one hit, the 
investigation of this compound was continued on the basis of the induction effect, the 
unique producing bacterium, the possibility that the compound may still be new and the 

67 
 
likelihood of finding additional analogues based on the large number of pseudomolecular 
ions present in the raw data.  
 
Although two families of compounds were identified as targets for further 
investigation, the media study revealed many other putatively induced metabolites that 
have not yet been pursued. Using the chemical barcodes as an identification tool, a list of 
high-priority candidates for subsequent scale-up and purification was created as a starting 
point for future efforts to discover new, induced natural products (Table 2.2). Mass 
features that were present above the threshold when the strain was grown in only one of 
the 14 media and in all three replicates were highlighted and located in the raw data. 
Since the chromatograms generated using the evaporative light-scattering detector 
(ELSD) give the most accurate indication of the relative amounts of the metabolites 
present, the [M+H]+ and all other abundant pseudomolecular ions for each true 
metabolite with a visible peak in the ELSD trace were recorded while others were 
eliminated from the list. Thus, the remaining metabolites were estimated to be present in 
sufficient quantities for purification following scaled-up fermentations. The m/z of the 
[M+H]+ and [M+Na]+ for each candidate was queried in AntiBase and metabolites that 
had close bacterial natural product hits were eliminated from the table. A total of 12 
putatively new, induced natural products remained which have to potential to be purified.

2.1.5. Large-scale fermentation and purification of terrosamycin A and B 
The search for new and induced compounds employing the OSMAC approach 
using different media types lead to the discovery of m/z 811.5205 [M-H]-, a metabolite 
whose biosynthesis was induced in a number of conditions. The producing bacterium 
Streptomyces sp. RKND004 was fermented on a large scale in 9 L of BFM3 broth which 
was shown to produce relatively large quantities of the compound. The cultures were 
extracted with ethyl acetate and the resulting deep-red coloured extracts were combined 
and fractionated by automated flash chromatography using a C18 stationary phase. 
Subsequent fractionation via automated flash chromatography with a silica stationary 
phase afforded 7.3 mg of 1 and 85.8 mg of 2 which were named terrosamycin A and 
terrosamycin B, respectively. 
2.1.6. Crystallization of terrosamycin A and analysis of X-ray diffraction data 
 
Preliminary NMR data acquired on impure samples during the purification 
process showed signals consistent with a polyether structure, suggesting the 
terrosamycins may belong to this family of natural products. Polyether natural products 
contain a carboxylic acid moiety and many stereocentres and thus structure elucidation is 
most often achieved through conversion to a salt, crystallization and X-ray diffraction 
(XRD) analysis of the crystal 66, 67. Salts of 1 and 2 were prepared using sodium 
hydroxide and subjected to a number of different crystallization conditions in an attempt 
to obtain crystals suitable for XRD analysis. Crystals of the terrosamycin A salt were 
obtained using a slow evaporation method with acetone and diH2O at 4 °C. XRD analysis 
and structure refinement was performed by Dr. Andreas Decken at the University of New 
Brunswick in Fredericton, New Brunswick, Canada (Appendix Tables 6.1-6.3).  

70 
 
 
The XRD analysis revealed terrosamycin A (1) is indeed a polyether compound. 
The structure features one five-membered and four six-membered heterocyclic rings 
containing ether linkages (Figure 2.6). As is common to all compounds in this family, a 
carboxylic acid functional group is located at one end of the molecule. Terrosamycin A 
also contains a ketone functionality as well as five hydroxyl groups, two of which are 
bound to carbon atoms of ether groups forming cyclic hemiketals. In addition, 11 methyl 
groups are found along the carbon chain. Twenty stereocentres are located within the 
structure and are defined in Figure 2.6 C. Curiously, crystallization and XRD analysis of 
the terrosamycin B salt resulted in an identical crystal structure. As the molecular weight 
was not in agreement, it was hypothesized that one of two events had taken place; the 
crystals obtained were due to a small amount of 1 present as an impurity in the sample, or 
perhaps the conditions used to prepare the salts caused a conversion of 2 to 1 prior to 
crystallization.

72 
 
As discussed in Chapter 1, polyether natural products are known to form 
complexes with monovalent and divalent metal cations 66, 67 . The metals can coordinate 
to oxygen and nitrogen atoms within the structure causing the polyether to wrap itself 
around the metal. This process results in a cage-like formation with a hydrophilic inner-
sphere and hydrophobic outer-sphere giving polyethers useful biological properties which 
will be discussed in section 2.1.8. The complexes are usually stabilized by intramolecular 
hydrogen bonding involving the carboxylic acid and hydroxyl groups 67. The crystal 
structure of 1 shows complexation in a cage-like formation around a potassium atom. 
Figure 2.7 shows coordination bonds from the metal to the O1, O2, O5, O8, O9, O11, 
O12 and O13 atoms indicating an eightfold coordination which is typical of potassium 
136. Dotted lines in Figure 2.7 depict the three hydrogen bonds (O7-H7…O1, O8-
H8…O6 and C21-H21…O1) which were found within the inner-sphere and likely 
contribute to stabilization of the complex.

black) between oxygen atoms O1, O2, O5, O8, O9, O11, O12 and O13 and potassium. 
Three hydrogen bonds (dotted black) were found within the molecule between O7-
H7…O1, O8-H8…O6 and C21-H21…O1. 
 
 
 
 
 
 

74 
 
The observed coordination to potassium is surprising; since the salts of these 
compounds were prepared using aqueous sodium hydroxide, the metal atom was 
expected to be sodium. The supplier of the sodium hydroxide used to prepare the aqueous 
solution reports the presence of trace amounts of potassium up to a concentration of 
0.02%. This suggests that 1 selectively binds potassium despite a large excess of sodium. 
This phenomenon is not uncommon among members of the polyether family and binding 
studies involving numerous monovalent and divalent metal cations are often performed 
generating a selectivity order. Salinomycin, perhaps the most well-studied polyether 
antibiotic, can complex both monovalent and divalent metal cations with an affinity order 
of K+ > Na+ > Cs+ > Sr2+ > Ca2+ = Mg2+ 67. Ionomycin is selective for divalent cations in 
the order Ca2+ > Mg2+, where binding to Sr2+ and Ba2+ was insignificant 137. Calcimycin, 
as the name suggests, has a high affinity for Ca2+ 138 but can also form a 2:1 complex with 
Mg2+, Ni2+ and Zn2+ 139, 140, 141. The size, shape of the cage formed around the metal, as 
well as the number of ligands available for coordination, is what influences the selectivity 
of each complex. Cations with an atomic radius that fit the cage will bind easily; smaller 
cations must adopt a non-optimal coordination geometry and larger ones must distort the 
cage in order to fit 67, 142, 143. Interestingly, coordination to different metal cations can 
influence the bioactivity of the entire complex. The 2:1 salt complexes of monensin with 
Ba2+ and Mg2+ showed superior growth inhibition of Mycobacterium tuberculosis than 
various other monovalent and divalent cationic complexes 144. Cationomycin forms a 
more stable complex with K+ than Na+ and was found to transport K+ across bacterial cell 
membranes at a higher rate 145.  

75 
 
The structure of 1, including the stereochemistry of all chiral centres, is identical 
to that of N664-30 which was found as a match in AntiBase and SciFinder when the 
exact mass of the [M+H]+ and [M+Na]+ adducts were queried. The compound has only 
been reported once before; N664-30 along with its producing strain Streptomyces sp. 
N664-30 were patented by Pfizer Inc. in 1990 135. The structure was determined using 
XRD and tentatively reported with 98% confidence causing the patent to include only a 
compound possessing the physical and chemical properties described. No XRD, NMR or 
other structural data was included in the patent. Though the authors describe possible use 
of the compound as an antibiotic for large farm animals and domestic pets, and as an 
anticoccidial agent for chickens, there is no mention of any specific bioactivity except 
that activity against “certain” Gram-positive and Gram-negative microorganisms was 
observed. Due to the lack of information included in the now expired patent, 1 and 2 
named terrosamycin A and B, were further investigated in our lab. Since crystals of the 
terrosamycin B salt were not obtained, its structure was elucidated spectroscopically. 
2.1.7. Spectroscopic structure elucidation of terrosamycin A and B 
Terrosamycin A (1) and B (2) were both isolated as a colourless glass and 
HRESIMS analysis supported molecular formulae of C44H75O13 (m/z 811.5205 [M-H]-, Δ 
= 0.1 ppm) and C46H79O13 (m/z 839.5504 [M-H]-, Δ = 0.2 ppm), respectively. The 
molecular structure of 1 deduced from the crystal structure contains seven degrees of 
unsaturation accounted for by the carboxylic acid, ketone and five rings which matched 
the degree of unsaturation predicted by the molecular formula. The degree of 
unsaturation predicted for 2 was also seven suggesting similar structural features. 

76 
 
The NMR data for terrosamycin A (1) (Table 2.3) was in agreement with the 
crystal structure. The characteristic carboxylic carbon resonance C-1 (δC 183.6) and the 
HMBC correlations between H-2 (δH 2.58)/C1, H-3 (δH 3.66)/C-1 and H-44 (δH 1.08)/C-1 
located the acid moiety on one end of the molecule. COSY correlations between 
neighbouring CH and CH2 protons confirmed the connectivity of the carbon chain from 
C-2 (δC 44.5) through to C-12 (δC 30.4). Methyl groups were located along the chain by 
the COSY correlations H-44/H-2, H-43 (δH 0.87)/H-3, H-42 (δH 0.78)/H-10 (δH 1.29) and 
H-41 (δH 0.87)/H-12 (δH 1.49) which were further validated by the appropriate HMBC 
correlations. The relatively downfield chemical shifts of C-3 (δC 82.6) and C-7 (δC 75.5) 
indicated the presence of oxygen between them locating the ether linkage within the first 
six-membered ring. The chemical shifts of the alpha protons H-3 and H-7 (δH 3.67) were 
in agreement with this assignment.

The two HMBC correlations H-11 (δH 1.30)/C-13 (δC 99.8) and H-41/C-13, and 
the lack of a C-13 cross peak in the HSQC spectrum suggested that C-13 was a 
quaternary carbon attached to C-12. Similar to the first ring, the second ether linkage was 
assigned between C-9 (δC 75.6) and C-13 based on the characteristic ether carbon 
chemical shifts and the alpha proton H-9 (δH 3.65). The HMBC correlations H-14 (δH 
1.66)/C-13 and H-15 (δH 4.10)/C-13 showed attachment of the continuing polyether chain 
to C-13. Compared to C-9, the quaternary C-13 resonance was further downshifted which 
suggested the attachment of an electron withdrawing group. The XRD data confirmed 
this was a hydroxyl group revealing the first of two cyclic hemiketal functionalities. 
Again, COSY correlations between neighbouring CH and CH2 protons extended 
the carbon chain from C-14 (δC 44.3) to C-18 (δC 40.2) and the positions of two more 
methyl groups were established using the H-40 (δH 0.84)/H-16 (δH 1.40) and H-39 (δH 
0.91)/H-18 (δH 1.72) correlations. Like C-13, C-19 (δC 101.3) was determined to be 
quaternary as no cross peak was observed in the HSQC spectrum at that resonance. The 
HMBC correlations H-17 (δH 1.48)/C-19, H-18/C-19 and H-39/C-19 connected C-18 to 
C-19. The second cyclic hemiketal functionality was revealed based on the C-15 (δC 
72.9) and C-19 resonances, HMBC correlations H-20 (δH 1.57)/C-19 and H-21 (δH 
4.22)/C-19 and confirmation of a hydroxyl group at C-19 based on XRD data. 
COSY correlations H-20/H-21 and H-21/H-22 (δH 3.50) implied connectivity of 
C-20 to C-21 and C-21 to C-22 (δC 45.6). The downshifted resonances of C-21 and H-21 
indicated attachment of an electron withdrawing group at C-21 which was confirmed to 
be a hydroxyl group by XRD. Another methyl group was placed at C-22 as a result of the 
COSY correlation H-22/H-38 (δH 0.99). The ketone was located at C-23 (δC 220.7) using 

80 
 
HMBC correlations H-21/C-23, H-22/C-23 and H-38/C-23. The HMBC correlation H-37 
(δH 1.10)/C-23 suggested the presence of a methyl group on the carbon attached to the 
ketone at C-23. The lack of any COSY correlations for H-37 implied the methyl group 
may be attached to a quaternary carbon. An HMBC correlation between the methyl 
protons and a quaternary carbon, H-37/C-24 (δC 79.9) confirmed this attachment. 
Extending the chain, the HMBC signals H-25 (δC 4.47)/C-23 and H-25/C-37 (δC 21.1) 
showed connectivity between C-24 and C-25 (δC 84.9). As C-24 was a quaternary carbon 
with a relatively downshifted resonance, a hydroxyl group was assumed to be attached 
and again this was confirmed by XRD. 
Connectivity of C-25 to C-26 (δC 25.8) and C-26 to C-27 (δC 33.6) was 
established by COSY correlations H-25/H-26 (δH 1.86) and H-26/H-27 (δH 1.65). The 
HMBC correlations H-26/C-28 (δC 84.9) and H-27/C-28 showed attachment of C-27 to 
C-28 and the HSQC data suggested C-28 was quaternary. Again, based on the downfield 
chemical shifts of the carbons and alpha protons, an ether linkage was located between C-
25 and C-28 closing the five-membered ring. The HMBC correlation H-36 (δH 1.22)/C-
28 located a methyl group on C-28, and the H-29 (δH 3.56)/C-28 and H-36/C-29 
correlations connected C-28 and C-29. COSY correlations H-29/H-30 (δH 1.60) and H-
30/H-31 (δH 1.66) extended the carbon chain by confirming connection between C-29 
and C-30 (δC 22.0), and C-30 and C-31 (δC 31.8). It was determined that the quaternary 
carbon C-32 (δC 70.3) was attached to C-31 due to observed HMBC correlations H-30/C-
32 and H-31/C-32. An HMBC correlation H-35 (δH 1.11)/C-32 connected a methyl group 
to C-32, and the correlations H-35/C-33 (δC 79.2) and H-33 (δH 4.08)/C-32 established 
connectivity between C-32 and C-33. The remaining methyl group was attached to C-33 

81 
 
on the basis of the COSY correlation H-33/H-34 (δH 1.23). The downshifted resonances 
of C-29 and C-33 and their associated protons H-29 and H-33, as well as the HMBC 
correlations H-29/C-33 and H-33/C-29 placed the last ether linkage and closed the final 
ring. Finally, the downfield shift of the quaternary carbon C-32 revealed the remaining 
hydroxyl group was attached at this position.  
The NMR data for terrosamycin B (2) (Table 2.3) revealed similar signals and 
correlations with the exception of two additional resonances; C-45 (δC 47.6) and C-46 (δC 
49.1) and their corresponding protons H-45 (δH 3.14) and H-46 (δH 3.27) which had 
chemical shifts characteristic of methoxy groups. Their locations were confirmed by two 
HMBC correlations H-45/C-13 and H-46/C-19. The presence of two cyclic ketal 
functionalities rather than cyclic hemiketals was consistent with the molecular weight and 
predicted molecular formula for 2. Since no XRD data was obtained, the stereochemistry 
of all 20 chiral centres is assumed to be the same as 1. The key correlations used to 
determine the molecular structures are shown in Figure 2.8.

Determination of the structure of 2 provided clarity as to why crystals of its salt 
were not obtained. Conversion of 1 to its potassium salt was achieved by first dissolving 
the compound in aqueous ethanol followed by dropwise addition of “NaOH”. Dissolution 
of the polyether in aqueous ethanol resulted in acidic conditions due to the dissociation of 
the carboxylic acid. Subjecting 2 to these conditions would likely cause acid-catalyzed 
hydrolysis of the cyclic ketals to hemiketals 146, effectively converting 2 into 1 before the 
addition of NaOH (Figure 2.9). This explains why crystals from terrosamycin B samples 
possessed the structure of terrosamycin A. The stereochemistry at C-13 and C-19 can 
vary as nucleophillic attack by water may occur from either side; this offers an 
explanation for the broad peak for 1 observed in LC-MS chromatograms as water was 
used in the solvent system (Appendix Figure 6.1-6.2). Presumably, the crystal structure 
features the most stable enantiomers. 
The conversion of ketals to hemiketals by hydrolysis is an equilibrium which 
occurs only under acidic aqueous conditions 147. Thus, any time these compounds were 
exposed to water, an equilibrium between them was occurring. The purification of 1 and 
2 involved liquid chromatography using a solvent system of water and methanol. The 
equilibrium typically lies in favour of hemiketal formation 147, though under these 
conditions it could shift toward formation of the ketal since methanol was present in 
relatively high concentrations. This may explain why a much higher quantity of 2 (85.8 
mg) was obtained in comparison to 1 (7.3 mg) despite 1 being the most abundant 
compound in the crude extract (Appendix Figure 6.2).

The equilibrium that occurs between these two compounds raises questions as to 
whether terrosamycin B is a genuine natural product, or simply the result of methanolysis 
of terrosamycin A under acidic conditions with methanol. Though there are many 
polyether natural products that possess cyclic hemiketal functional groups 66, 67, there are 
few which possess cyclic ketals that have been reported. Ketal-containing derivatives of 
the polyether ionophores K-41 66, X-14868B 148, maduramycin 149 and mutalomycin 77 
have all been found to arise from synthetic modifications, whether performed 
intentionally or found accidentally. CP-70828 and CP-70228 are the only two reported 
compounds containing cyclic ketals that were claimed to be natural products 150. The 
authors demonstrated both the purification of the compounds directly from fermentation 
broth and purposeful conversion between the hemiketal and ketal by treatment with 
methanol. This being said, it is questionable whether CP-70828 and CP70228 are genuine 
natural products; the use of large amounts of methanol during their purification may have 
caused methanolysis. To determine whether 2 was truly produced by Streptomyces sp. 
RKND004, the fermentation broth was extracted and analyzed without the use of 
methanol at any stage. An XIC revealed that 2 was still present in the crude extract 
despite never contacting methanol which suggests it is truly a natural product (Appendix 
Figure 6.17).  
As mentioned earlier, terrosamycin A has been previously reported in a patent 
under the name N664-30 135. Since the patent leaves out many structural and biological 
properties, and analogue 2 is a new compound, our lab has renamed both compounds 
after the Prince Edward Island soil from which their producing bacterium was isolated. 
The name terrosamycin comes from “terra” meaning soil and “rosa” meaning red. 

86 
 
2.1.8. Bioactivity of terrosamycin A and B 
 
Polyether natural products have been shown to exhibit a very wide range of 
biological effects including antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral and antiparasitic activities. 
Some members of this highly active family have also been explored for their potential as 
anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory and herbicidal agents 73. Additionally, a number of 
polyethers possess immunoregulatory 81 or cardiovascular effects 80. Despite all these 
interesting activities, polyether natural products are mostly known for their antibiotic 
activity against Gram-positive bacteria. As discussed in Chapter 1, they owe their potent 
antibiotic activity to their ability to act as an ionophore; a compound that is able to 
reversibly bind ions and transport them across cell membranes. Crystal structures 
determined from XRD studies have shown that these polyether ionophores wrap 
themselves around metal cations and bind via coordination of the oxygen atoms 66, 67. The 
resulting complex is cage-like with the hydrophilic oxygen atoms comprising the inner-
sphere. The inner-sphere is contained by the surrounding polyether hydrocarbon chain 
which renders the entire complex hydrophobic 67. A space-filling model of the crystal 
structure of 1 is shown in Figure 2.10 illustrating this effect. Oxygen atoms can barely be 
seen in the centre of the complex and are essentially covered by the alkyl chain. These 
lipophilic complexes can easily penetrate the cell membrane of Gram-positive bacteria 
via three separate mechanisms 71. Cell death arises as a result of the neutral metal-bound 
complex transporting cations into the cell which disrupts the Na+/K+ gradient causing the 
cell to swell and burst 67. A small number of polyethers have shown activity towards 
Gram-negative pathogens 75, 76, 77, however in general, the lipopolysaccharide outer 

87 
 
membrane of Gram-negative bacteria acts as an effective barrier against diffusion of 
these hydrophobic antibiotics 151.

The antimicrobial activity of 1 and 2 was evaluated in a number of bioassays. For 
comparison, three known polyether ionophore standards were chosen and tested in 
parallel. Salinomycin, nigericin and monensin and its methyl ester (Figure 2.11) were 
selected due to the fact that they all exhibit potent antibiotic activity against Gram-
positive pathogens and are among the most well-studied polyether natural products to 
date. Furthermore, salinomycin and monensin are currently approved and marketed in 
Canada as antibiotics and anticoccidial agents in cattle and poultry. The compounds were 
each tested against the Gram-positive pathogens methicillin-resistant Staphyloccocus 
aureus (MRSA), vancomycin resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE) and Staphylococcus 
warneri, Gram-negative pathogens Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus vulgaris, and 
the yeast pathogen Candida albicans. Expectedly, no activity was observed against P. 
aeruginosa, P. vulgaris or C. albicans even up to the highest tested concentration of 128 
μg/mL. Only the monensin methyl ester also did not show activity in any of the Gram-
positive pathogen assays. Table 2.4 shows the half-maximal inhibitory concentrations 
(IC50) for each compound against MRSA, VRE and S. warneri. For each pathogen, 
monensin had the highest IC50 values of 1.54 ± 0.13, 8.32 ± 4.67 and 1.97 ± 0.18 μM, 
respectively indicating that other than its methyl ester, monensin was the least active in 
all assays. In the case of MRSA, nigericin possessed the lowest IC50 of 0.20 ± 0.05 μM, 
while 1 and 2 had similar activity to salinomycin with values of 0.53 ± 0.16, 0.34 ± 0.04 
and 0.43 ± 0.11 μM, respectively. In VRE assays, 1, 2 and nigericin had the lowest IC50 
values of 0.58 ± 0.04, 0.51 ± 0.13 and 0.52 μM while salinomycin was slightly less 
potent with a value of 0.80 ± 0.24 μM. For S. warneri, nigericin was the most potent with 
an IC50 value of 0.29 ± 0.07, while values of 0.90 ± 0.32, 0.69 ± 0.10 and 0.88 ± 0.20 μM 

90 
 
implied 1, 2 and salinomycin had similar activity. In MRSA and VRE assays, the 
terrosamycins, salinomycin and nigericin had lower IC50 values than the control 
compounds vancomycin and rifampicin demonstrating the potent antibiotic activity of

In addition to being excellent antibiotics, polyether natural products have been the 
subject of recent research since the 2009 discovery of selective anti-cancer activity by 
salinomycin 87. Though more work is needed to determine their specific mechanisms of 
action, many polyethers (including the selected standards) have exhibited potent activity 
against a broad spectrum of cancer cells, including multi-drug resistant cells and cancer 
stem cells (CSCs) 71. Most notably, pilot clinical trials have shown the ability of 
salinomycin to reduce tumor volume and metastasis in four metastatic breast cancer 
patients as well as a metastatic ovarian cancer patient and a head and neck squamous cell 
carcinoma patient with no long term side effects 90.  Monensin has been identified as a 
potent and specific inhibitor of prostate cancer cell growth 152, while nigericin has been 
shown to specifically target CSCs in nasopharyngeal carcinoma and suppress metastasis 
in colorectal cancer 153, 154. Furthermore, studies indicate that polyethers can increase 
sensitivity to chemotherapy and possible combinatory therapy is currently being explored 
155.  
In light of this information, 1, 2 and our polyether standards were tested against a 
human breast adenocarcinoma cell line (HTB-26) and a human invasive breast ductal 
carcinoma cells (MCF-7). The compounds were also tested in a healthy human foreskin 
fibroblast cell line (BJ) and healthy Cercopithecus aethiops kidney epithelial cells (Vero) 
as an evaluation of cytotoxicity toward non-cancerous cells. Table 2.5 displays the IC50 
values of each compound in each of the cell lines tested. All compounds tested showed a 
selective response toward cancerous cells as opposed to healthy cells. In the HTB-26 cell 
line, 2 showed the best growth inhibition with an IC50 value of 5.49 ± 1.23 μM, while 1 
and salinomycin had a similar response with values of 10.1 ± 0.63 μM and 10.0 ± 1.21 

94 
 
μM, respectively. Terrosamycin B (2) also showed the best growth inhibition in the 
MCF-7 cell line with an IC50 value of 3.92 ± 0.42 μM, while terrosamycin A (1) had the 
next best response at 5.90 ± 1.44 μM. Although 1 had the most cytotoxicity toward 
healthy cells, 2 showed the least cytotoxicity in the BJ cell line and was second only to 
monensin in the Vero cell line. It is exciting to highlight that the activity of the 
terrosamycins was superior to salinomycin which has progressed to pilot clinical trials for 
the treatment of breast cancer, among other cancers 156. This assay has shown that 
terrosamycin B in particular has a larger therapeutic window than salinomycin. These 
results suggest that the terrosamycins could be promising new candidates for anticancer 
drug development.

Differences in the IC50 values provide some insight into the structure-activity 
relationship (SAR) of these compounds. The antimicrobial assay revealed the monensin 
methyl ester exhibited no activity. Further, it displayed the weakest anticancer activity in 
cytotoxicity assays. The lack of activity of monensin esters compared to the free acid has 
been observed before and suggests the carboxylic acid moiety of polyethers is important 
for activity 157, 158. Though the structures of 1, 2, salinomycin, nigericin and monensin are 
quite different, they exhibited similar activities in the antimicrobial assay (with the 
exception of monensin displaying a slightly weaker effect against Gram-positive 
pathogens) and it is likely their mechanisms of action are the same. As mentioned in 
Chapter 1, it has been determined that different polyethers act on cancerous cells via 
distinct mechanisms; this is a current topic of study in which new findings are emerging 
regularly. For this reason, it is difficult to speculate on the SARs of these compounds in 
cytotoxicity assays. This being said, the slightly superior anticancer activity and less 
detrimental effect on healthy cells exhibited by 2 compared with 1 suggests the ketal 
functionalities of 2 play a role in the mechanism of action.  
2.2. THE EFFECTS OF CO-CULTURE MIMIC CONDITIONS ON NATURAL 
PRODUCT PRODUCTION 
2.2.1. Introduction 
 
Using our newly established co-culture mimic approach, three bacterial strains 
were subjected to fermentation with a variety of environmentally relevant stressors and 
the resulting changes in natural product production were examined. The actinomycetes K. 
cystarginea, K. griseola and Streptomyces sp. RKND004 were fermented in media 
supplemented with a heat-killed culture of either Aspergillus flavus NRRL 3357, Bacillus 

97 
 
subtilis ATCC 6051 or Mycobacterium smegmatis ATCC 12051. A heat-killed culture of 
the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans N2 with its food source Escherichia coli OP50 was 
also used as a stressor. The stressors were added to the actinomycete cultures at different 
stages of the fermentation and/or in different concentrations in an attempt to find optimal 
conditions for an observable change in the secondary metabolism. Differences between 
natural product production in co-culture mimic fermentations and control cultures were 
visualized using scatter plots and metabolites whose production was induced or 
upregulated in the presence of the stressor were recorded.  
2.2.2. Preparation of stressors 
In naturally occurring microbial ecosystems, organisms are often forced to 
compete with neighboring species for resources in order to thrive. It is hypothesized that 
these stressful environments stimulate natural product production that is not normally 
observed in the luxurious conditions of axenic cultures grown in the laboratory 111. As a 
result, the microbes used in co-culture studies are often chosen in an attempt to imitate a 
naturally occurring ecosystem. Since the producer microbes are terrestrial actinomycetes 
that were isolated from soil samples, a diverse group of soil-dwelling organisms were 
chosen as stressors for this study. Each stressor organism is known to produce a number 
of secondary metabolites that may potentially affect the secondary metabolism of the 
actinomycetes. The fungal species A. flavus has a cosmopolitan distribution though it is 
mostly found in soil environments where it is able to survive harsh conditions and in turn, 
out-compete its microbial neighbours for space and nutrients 159.  The bacterium B. 
subtilis is present in soil and is highly competitive through production of numerous 
bioactive natural products 160. Similarly, the bacterial species M. smegmatis can be found 

98 
 
in soil and resist harsh conditions by natural product production 161. In recent studies, the 
soil nematode C. elegans (Figure 2.12) was found to produce nematode-derived modular 
metabolites that serve as signals that are connected with the development and behavior of 
these animals 162.

microscope. The nematodes shown are in multiple different stages of growth.

The fungus A. flavus and two bacteria, B. subtilis and M. smegmatis were 
fermented in brain-heart infusion (BHI) broth on a large scale and then the cultures were 
killed via autoclaving. A liquid culture of the nematode C. elegans with its E. coli food 
source and an axenic control culture of E. coli (for control fermentations) were each 
fermented on a large scale in S medium 163 and killed by autoclaving. The cultures were 
each streaked onto agar plates before autoclaving and determined to be pure.  After 
autoclaving, the cultures were streaked onto plates once more; no growth was observed 
which confirmed their sterilization. A control stressor for the microbial co-culture mimic 
experiments (to be added to control fermentations) was prepared by autoclaving 
uninoculated BHI broth twice consecutively. A 100-fold diluted sample of each stressor 
and the BHI and E. coli control was prepared with sterile diH2O. The microbial stressors 
all contained visible biomass and the nematode stressor contained many small carcasses. 
2.2.3. Small-scale fermentations and extractions 
Each of the three actinomycetes (K. cystarginea NRRL B-16505, K. griseola 
NRRL B-16229 and Streptomyces sp. RKND004) was fermented on a small scale in 
BFM4 broth, which was chosen based on the fact that it stimulated prolific natural 
product production based on the previous OSMAC experiments. On the second day of the 
five day fermentation, the A. flavus, B. subtilis and M. smegmatis stressors were added to 
the cultures. Each actinomycete culture received an aliquot of either the concentrated or 
100-fold diluted stressor which resulted in a final concentration of 10% and 0.1% (v/v), 
respectively. Each producer and stressor pair was performed in triplicate. Uninoculated 
tubes containing only BFM4 and a 10% and 0.1% concentration of the stressor were 
included as media blanks. Inoculated controls for each actinomycete strain were included 

101 
 
and received aliquots of the twice-autoclaved BHI broth at each concentration. Adding 
the BHI broth to the control cultures ensured any changes in natural product production 
of the actinomycetes could be attributed to the presence of the stressor and not the BHI 
broth. All culture broths and blanks were extracted with ethyl acetate and the extracts 
were analyzed using LC-MS over two batches of analysis, each including a reserpine 
instrumental control and three methanol blanks to limit carryover.  
 
In a separate set of experiments, each of the actinomycetes was fermented on a 
small scale in BFM3 broth, also chosen based on the results of the previous OSMAC 
experiments. The C. elegans stressor was added to the cultures (to final concentrations of 
10% or 0.1%) in triplicate at two separate time points; at the time of inoculation and on 
the fourth day of the five day fermentation. Uninoculated media blanks containing only 
BFM3 received the C. elegans stressor at each concentration, while inoculated controls 
received each concentration of sterile E. coli culture at the same time points. By adding 
the sterile E. coli culture to the control fermentations, any changes observed in the 
secondary metabolism of the actinomycetes could be attributed to the presence of the C. 
elegans stressor only and not its E. coli food source. All culture broths and blanks were 
extracted with ethyl acetate and the extracts were analyzed using LC-MS over two 
batches in the same manner as previous samples. In total, K. cystarginea, K. griseola and 
Streptomyces sp. RKND004 were each fermented in ten different stress conditions which 
are summarized in Table 2.6.

2.2.4. Data analysis and identification of upregulated and induced compounds 
 
All raw LC-MS data was processed using MZmine 2 as previously described in 
section 2.1.4. For experiments using the microbial stressors A. flavus, B. subtilis and M. 
smegmatis, data was processed in three separate batches according to the producer 
bacterium. Data for experiments using the nematode stressor C. elegans was processed in 
a single batch. The mass detection threshold for each batch was set at 2E3 to ensure 
detection of genuine signals while avoiding the inclusion of noise in the data set. An 
aligned peak list was created for each producer with each stressor. Peaks detected in the 
media blanks, methanol blanks and reserpine standard samples were manually deleted. 
Finally, the custom database identification function was used to annotate the peak lists 
with the names of bacterial natural products in the AntiBase database having exact 
masses that matched the m/z of mass features in the list. 
 
Scatter plots were used to visualize the effect of the stressor on the secondary 
metabolism of the producer. As an example, Figure 2.13 shows the peak area of mass 
features detected in K. cystarginea cultures when grown in the control conditions versus 
cultures in which the A. flavus stressor was added. In the scatter plot, points that lie above 
the x = y line have a larger peak area in the stress condition indicating upregulation of 
that feature. Similarly, points below the line show downregulation in response to the 
stressor. Interestingly, points that appear to sit along a vertical line at the left of the plot 
were not detected in the control conditions but were present when the producer was 
grown with the stressor indicating a possible induction of that feature. Since the mass 
detection threshold was set at 2E3 it was possible that those mass features may have still 
been present in controls albeit below the threshold. Furthermore, it was also possible that 

104 
 
those features may have been present below the threshold in the media blanks. This 
would mean they are not truly K. cystarginea metabolites, but rather a component of the 
media or a metabolite produced by A. flavus before autoclaving. Manual inspection of the 
raw data was therefore required to validate any findings.

105 
 
 
Figure 2.13. A scatter plot generated in MZmine 2 comparing the peak area of mass features detected in a K. cystarginea control 
fermentation with their peak area in fermentations with the 10% A. flavus stressor (AF1). Points that appear above the x = y line were 
upregulated while those that appear below were downregulated. Points on the far left that align vertically were not detected above the 
2E3 threshold in the control but were detected in the co-culture mimic. Points that align horizontally across the bottom were detected 
in the control but not in the co-culture mimic. 

106 
 
Moving forward, the mass features present in the controls were deleted from the 
data sets leaving only features that appeared to be induced. Putatively induced features 
that were detected in each of the three replicates were further investigated; a total of 86 
for all producer/stressor combinations. In Xcalibur, the features were located within the 
raw data and XIC plots monitoring their abundance in the appropriate samples were 
constructed.  Those that were present in the media blank samples, as well as those that 
appeared to be part of the noise were disregarded. Features that were present in the 
controls with a smaller peak area than in the stress conditions were labeled as upregulated 
metabolites. Features that were absent in the controls were labeled as induced 
metabolites. An example of each case is shown in Figure 2.14 and 2.15 respectively.

Table 2.7 displays the upregulated and induced compounds found in this study. 
The induction/upregulation of each compound listed was observed in all three replicates. 
A total of 19 upregulated and 14 induced metabolites were uncovered. The majority of 
these (eight upregulated, 13 induced) were produced by K. cystarginea. Six upregulated 
compounds were produced by K. griseola while five upregulated and one induced 
compound were produced by Streptomyces sp. RKND004. Although most of these 
compounds were found as a result of only one stressor, seven upregulated and two 
induced compounds were produced in response to two or more stressors. This may 
suggest that while the production of some metabolites was triggered by specific 
conditions or chemical signals, others may be produced as a generalized stress response.

Most of the metabolites produced by K. cystarginea were a result of the fungal 
stressor A. flavus. One species of the Aspergillus genus, A. fumigatus, has been 
previously studied in co-culture experiments with bacteria, however in each case the 
induced metabolites were found to be produced by the fungus 164, 165, 166. Since the fungal 
culture was sterile in these experiments, the induced compounds must be of bacterial 
origin. K. griseola and Streptomyces sp. RKND004 did not show a response for one 
preferred stressor; each of the microbial stressors elicited an upregulated compound. The 
C. elegans stressor was responsible for the induction of two metabolites (one from K. 
cystarginea and one from Streptomyces sp. RKND004) as well as the upregulation of two 
Streptomyces sp. RKND004 metabolites and one K. cystarginea metabolite.  
Although an attempt was made to find an optimal stressor concentration for 
natural product induction, the results indicate neither concentration elicited a better 
induction effect than the other in each case. In the case of the C. elegans stressors, an 
attempt was made to optimize natural product production based on the time of addition of 
the stressor. One induced and three upregulated compounds were identified when the 
stressor was added at the time of inoculation (CE1 and CE2), while one compound was 
induced when the stressor was added on day four of the fermentation (CE3). Based on 
this small set of results, addition at the time of inoculation may have resulted in a better 
induction effect. This may be due to the fact that the producer had more time to produce 
metabolites in response to the stress. Further experiments are needed to confirm these 
initial findings.   
Since they are not produced under standard laboratory conditions, and are 
typically produced in low abundance, induced compounds have a high likelihood of 

113 
 
being novel. Furthermore, the compounds uncovered in this study had few or no hits in 
AntiBase. As expected, the ELSD trace in the raw data indicated that none of these 
metabolites were major compounds suggesting purification may be difficult. Ideally, 
additional experiments would be done to optimize the induction of these compounds 
before attempting co-culture mimic fermentations on a large-scale. 
2.3. PURIFICATION AND STRUCTURE ELUCIDATION OF PQS-GLCA, A 
NOVEL BIOTRANSFORMATION PRODUCT  
2.3.1. Introduction 
 
The discovery of cryptic natural products through induction experiments is a 
current theme in the Kerr lab. In particular, development of our co-culture mimic 
technique began with a project started by Ph. D. student Libang (Leon) Liang. Eight 
actinomycetes were subjected to co-culture mimic conditions using the same group of 
taxonomically diverse microbial stressors described in section 2.2.2, with the addition of 
the Gram-negative bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Again, LC-MS data 
from extracts of the cultures was processed with MZmine 2. Heat maps were constructed 
to identify any upregulation or induction of the actinomycete-produced metabolites. This 
work led to the discovery of the metabolite m/z 436.1961 [M+H]+ in the co-culture mimic 
fermentation of the sediment-derived actinomycete strain Streptomyces sp. RKBH B178 
with the stressor P. aeruginosa. 
 
Since P. aeruginosa is known to produce a number of quorum sensing molecules, 
an attempt was made to determine which, if any, specific metabolite present in the 
stressor was acting as a chemical signal to trigger the production of m/z 436.1961 

114 
 
[M+H]+. After interpretation of LC-MS data from extracts of axenic cultures of P. 
aeruginosa, the three major metabolites produced by the stressor before autoclaving were 
determined to be 2-heptyl-3-hydroxy-4-quinolone (the Pseudomonas quinolone signal, 
PQS), its precursor 2-heptyl-4-quinolone (HHQ) as well as a number of rhamnolipids. 
These compounds have all been reported to be produced by this bacterium; PQS and 
HHQ are key regulators of the bacterium’s quorum sensing system while rhamnolipids 
are an important virulence factor of the pathogen 167. A mixture of two rhamnolipids and 
pure HHQ and PQS were obtained from commercial sources and added separately to 
axenic cultures of Streptomyces sp. RKBH B178. The induced metabolite was observed 
in cultures where HHQ and PQS were present, suggesting that these two closely related 
compounds were responsible for m/z 436.1961 [M+H]+ production. 
With some insight into the induction mechanism, the project moved forward 
toward the purification and characterization of the metabolite of interest. Fermentation on 
multiple scales was conducted in order to determine the best fermentation volume for 
production of the compound. Once an optimal volume was determined, large-scale 
fermentations were undertaken and purification and structure elucidation were completed 
revealing the new compound PQS-GlcA as a biotransformation product of the 2-alkyl-4-
quinolone signals HHQ and PQS. The discovery of this compound is significant as it is 
connected to a novel mechanism of P. aeruginosa quorum sensing deactivation. 
 

115 
 
2.3.2. Multi-scale fermentations and extractions of Streptomyces sp. RKBH-B178 
 
As natural product production by bacterial strains often differs based on 
fermentation volume or vessel shape/size 168, 169, multi-scale fermentations of 
Streptomyces sp. RKBH-B178 were undertaken in order to determine optimal conditions 
for production of PQS-GlcA. Since both signaling molecules induced production of the 
metabolite in similar quantities, fermentations were supplemented with HHQ as it was 
relatively inexpensive compared to PQS.  Cultures of Streptomyces sp. RKBH-B178 with 
HHQ were fermented in volumes of 7 mL, 50 mL, 600 mL and 1 L. Cultures were 
extracted and the extracts were analyzed by LC-MS. MZmine 2 was used for data 
processing as previously described in section 2.1.4. An ion intensity plot monitoring the 
peak area of PQS-GlcA was constructed to compare production across each of the 
fermentation volumes (Figure 2.16). The 50 mL fermentations produced the metabolite in 
the largest relative quantity and thus this volume was chosen for subsequent scale-up.

with pure HHQ. PQS-GlcA was not detected in a control culture of the bacterium with no 
HHQ added. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

117 
 
2.3.3. Large-scale fermentations and purification of PQS-GlcA and bhimamycin A 
and E 
 
In order to obtain sufficient material for the purification, structure elucidation and 
bioactivity testing PQS-GlcA, a fermentation scale-up of Streptomyces sp. RKBH-B178 
with HHQ was performed. A total of 2.95 L was fermented in 50 mL volumes. Culture 
broths were extracted with ethyl acetate and the extracts were washed with water before 
fractionation by two successive rounds of automated flash chromatography with a C18 
stationary phase. Fractions containing the induced metabolite were further purified by 
RP-HPLC with a phenyl hexyl stationary phase to yield 0.4 mg of PQS-GlcA (3) as a 
yellow oil. Two additional metabolites were purified in the process and structure 
elucidation through NMR spectroscopy determined their identities as the previously 
reported compounds bhimamycin A and E (Appendix Figures 6.29-6.40). A yield of 5.80 
mg bhimamycin A and 15.92 mg of bhimamycin E were obtained after first round of 
automated flash chromatography. Both compounds were reported to be produced by a 
terrestrial Streptomycete 170. Bhimamycin A was found to possess moderate activity 
against B. subtilis and E. coli while bhimamycin E showed selective activity only towards 
S. aureus. Interestingly, the results of co-culture mimic experiments completed by Leon 
Liang revealed bhimamycin A was upregulated in response to both the P. aeruginosa 
stressor and pure HHQ addition.  
2.3.4. Structural characterization and stereochemical determination of PQS-GlcA 
 
HRMS analysis of PQS-GlcA (3) supported a molecular formula of C22H30NO8 
(m/z 436.1961 [M+H]+, tR 2.74 min, Δ = 1.1 ppm) indicating eight degrees of 
unsaturation. The NMR data (Table 2.8) revealed the presence of four aromatic protons, 

118 
 
H-6 (δH 8.27), H-7 (δH 7.38), H-8 (δH 7.67) and H-9 (δH 7.61) which were assigned by 
interpretation of COSY correlations and the key HMBC correlations H-6/C-10 (δC 
140.1), H-9/C-5 (δC 126.1), H-7/C-5 and H-8/C-10. The HMBC correlation H-6/C-4 (δC 
174.2) allowed one of the two carbonyl resonances to be unambiguously assigned to the 
C-4 position. The presence of a seven carbon alkyl chain was identified using COSY and 
HMBC correlations suggesting that the structure of 3 was similar to HHQ and PQS. Two 
HMBC correlations H-11 (δH 3.23, 2.98)/C-8 (δC 152.0) and H-11/C-3 (δC 139.2) allowed 
the two remaining aromatic carbon resonances to be assigned, indicating the presence of 
a quinolone ring with the alkyl chain attached to the C-2 position. This assignment is in 
agreement with previously reported chemical shift values for both HHQ and PQS 171.

The characteristic anomeric carbon resonance C-1' (δC 108.0) and the HMBC 
correlation between anomeric proton H-1' [4.68 (d, J = 7.8 Hz)] and C-3 showed the 
presence of a carbohydrate moiety attached to the C-3 position of the quinolone ring. The 
glycosidic spin system H-1' – H-5' was assigned by interpretation of COSY correlations. 
The remaining carbonyl signal was assigned to the C-6' (δC 177.0) position on the basis of 
an HMBC correlation H-5' (δH 3.57)/C-6' and is consistent with the proposed molecular 
formula. Meanwhile, coupling constants exhibited by H-1' and H-4' [δH 3.53 (t, J = 9.3 
Hz)] showed their axial relationship with neighbouring protons suggesting the presence 
of a β-glucuronic acid moiety. Tandem MS revealed fragmentation between the 
glucuronic acid (GlcA) moiety and the aglycone further corroborating the proposed 
structure (Appendix Figure 6.20). The key correlations used to determine the molecular 
structure are shown in Figure 2.17; structural similarity of PQS-GlcA to both HHQ and 
PQS suggests it is a biotransformation product resulting from glucuronidation at the C-3 
position.

The configuration of the GlcA substituent was determined using a previously 
reported method 172, 173, which involves the reaction of D- or L-aldoses with either 
cysteine methyl ester enantiomer and o-tolylisothiocyanate yielding methyl 2-
(polyhydroxylalkyl)-3-(o-tolylthiocarbamoyl)-thiazolidine-4(R)-carboxylates which are 
easily separated by RP-HPLC. Preparation of two thiocarbamoyl-thiazolidine derivative 
standards was achieved following Tanaka’s protocol using D-GlcA with L-cysteine 
methyl ester, and D-GlcA with D-cysteine methyl ester. Purified PQS-GlcA (3) was 
subjected to acidic conditions to cleave the sugar by hydrolysis before the Tanaka 
reaction was performed using D-cysteine methyl ester. The reaction products were 
subjected to LC-MS and the retention times of the derivatives were compared by creating 
an XIC plotting the intensity of their exact mass (Appendix Figure 6.28). The retention 
times of the PQS-GlcA/D-cysteine methyl ester derivative matched exactly with the D-
GlcA/D-cysteine methyl ester derivative at 25.28 min, indicating that 3 contains D-GlcA. 
2.3.5. Bioactivity of PQS-GlcA 
 
PQS is one of the four autoinducers (AI) produced by P. aeruginosa 167, 174. The 
signal binds to the receptor protein PqsR which in turn regulates the production of PQS 
by inducing transcription of the pqsA operon 175. This process results in the production of 
the precursor HHQ which can be converted to PQS by the monooxygenase PqsH 175. The 
HHQ intermediate can also act as an AI by binding PqsR however it has a much lower 
binding affinity than PQS 176. While HHQ can be recognized as a quorum sensing signal 
by some other bacterial species, PQS is an AI specific to P. aeruginosa 167. Nevertheless, 
the presence of both of these quinolone compounds has demonstrated an ability to affect 
the phenotypes of different Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria and 

123 
 
pathogenic yeast 177. Some microbes are able to avoid this phenotypic alteration by PQS. 
In a co-culture of P. aeruginosa and Candida albicans, the C. albicans signaling 
molecule farnesol affected the PQS quorum sensing system of the bacteria by binding to 
PqsR, inhibiting transcription of pqsA 178. Further studies suggest that indole, a signaling 
compound from E. coli, can also inhibit PQS signaling 179. 
 
The PQS-mediated quorum sensing of P. aeruginosa can also be inhibited 
through modification of its chemical structure. There are currently three known 
mechanisms of PQS deactivation; conversion to anthranilic acid by Rhodococcus sp. 
BG43 180, conversion to 2-heptyl-2-hydroxy-1,2-dihydroquinoline-3,4-dione (HHQD) by 
Achromobacter xylosoxidans Q19 181 and conversion to N-octanoylanthranilic acid by the 
exogenously supplemented 1H-3-hydroxy-4-oxoquinaldine 2,4-dioxygenase Hod 182. 
Each of these mechanisms involves modification of the structure at the C-3 position 
suggesting the substituent at this position is important for activity. To determine whether 
the glucuronidation of PQS at C-3 is a fourth method of inhibiting PQS quorum sensing, 
the activity of PQS-GlcA was evaluated by Leon Liang. The assay utilized the 
bioreporter strain Pseudomonas putida KT2440 [pBBR-pqsR-pqsA’-‘lacZ] 183 which was 
not capable of producing HHQ or PQS. The strain contained a plasmid with the psqR 
gene which encoded the PqsR receptor, and the pqsA gene which is regulated by PqsR. 
The pqsA gene was fused to the lacZ reporter gene. Thus, the binding of quorum sensing-
active molecules to PqsR activated the transcription of both pqsA and lacZ. Quorum 
sensing activity was determined by measuring the activity of the catalytically active β-
galactosidase produced by lacZ. 

124 
 
 
The activity of PQS-GlcA (3) was compared to that of HHQ and PQS which were 
also tested in the assay. The half-maximal effective concentrations (EC50) of PQS and 
HHQ were 0.03 ± 0.14 μM and 1.31 ± 0.17 μM respectively, which were comparable to a 
previous report 183. The activity of 3 was much lower, with an EC50 value of 1.60 ± 0.01 
mM.  The results suggest that the glucuronidation of PQS causes inhibition of quorum 
sensing activity and therefore is a fourth method of PQS deactivation, performed by 
Streptomyces sp. RKBH B178. The presence of 3 in both HHQ- and PQS-supplemented 
cultures suggests this can be both a one- and two-step process. In order for the 
glucuronidation to take place in the HHQ-supplemented fermentations, Streptomyces sp. 
RKBH B178 likely has a monooxygenase isofunctional to PqsH in order to hydroxylate 
the C-3 position. This has also been suggested in the case of Rhodococcus sp. BG43 
which was found to turn HHQ into PQS before deactivation by conversion to anthranilic 
acid 180. Glucuronidation can then take place at the hydroxyl on C-3 by way of a 
glucuronosyltransferase. A schematic of the four PQS deactivation mechanisms is shown 
in Figure 2.18.

Rhodococcus sp. G43 and Streptomyces sp. RKBH B178 followed by the three known, 
and our new, PQS quorum sensing deactivation mechanisms. 
 
 

126 
 
As previously mentioned, glucuronidation is associated with the detoxification 
process. Presumably Streptomyces sp. RKBH B178 performs this deactivation in order to 
protect itself against harmful effects of HHQ and PQS, however when tested, the growth 
of the bacterium was not inhibited by HHQ. When evaluated for their ability to block 
quorum sensing in this manner, none of the 16 additional actinomycetes tested were able 
to biotransform HHQ into PQS-GlcA suggesting they are devoid of this 
glucuronosyltransferase. Though the reason for PQS-GlcA formation by Streptomyces sp. 
RKBH B178 remains unclear, the enzymatic deactivation of the P. aeruginosa quorum 
sensing molecules is a subject of current research for the development of therapeutics 
targeting infections in humans.

CHAPTER 3 
CONCLUSIONS  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

128 
 
3.1. THE EFFECTS OF VARYING CULTURE MEDIA ON NATURAL 
PRODUCT PRODUCTION 
 
Two species of the rare genus Kitasatospora and a streptomycete were evaluated 
for natural product production in 14 different media in an OSMAC 105 approach. 
Metabolomics analysis via the creation of chemical barcodes allowed visualization of the 
effects of using different culture media for natural product production. This methodology 
revealed many metabolites whose production was upregulated or induced as a result of 
fermentation in specific media. The results indicated that the activation of otherwise 
“silent” gene clusters took place and successfully elicited the expression of cryptic 
natural products.  
 
The Prince Edward Island sediment isolate Streptomyces sp. RKND004 was 
prioritized for further investigation based on the production of a large family of 
metabolites that were induced in a number of media. A comparison of the relative 
production levels of these compounds in each of the different media using MZmine 2 133 
allowed the selection of an optimal medium for large-scale fermentations. Two members 
of this family were purified and identified as polyether ionophores. Although one of the 
compounds had been reported once in a patent (which was lacking spectroscopic 
characterization and bioactivity data), its analogue was new. The compounds, which were 
named terrosamycin A and B, exhibited excellent antibiotic activity toward Gram-
positive pathogens which was expected based on their structures. Interestingly, both 
analogues showed selective anticancer activity; growth inhibition of two breast cancer 
cell lines was observed while the growth of healthy cells was not affected to the same 
extent.  

129 
 
 
The antibiotic activity of the terrosamycins was comparable to a number of 
polyether standards which are currently used commercially as antibiotic and anticoccidial 
agents in veterinary medicine. The patent for terrosamycin A (formerly N664-30) was 
filed by the large pharmaceutical company Pfizer Inc. for use in veterinary medicine 135. 
Although no clinical trial data exists for this compound and the patent has now expired, 
the use of the terrosamycins in this industry is still a possibility pending further in-vitro 
and in-vivo testing. Polyether ionophores have never been used for infections in humans 
because of the toxicity observed in some mammals 71 and until recently, have been 
completely overlooked for their treatment of human cancers 87, 71, 156. Excitingly, the 
terrosamycins, particularly the new analogue terrosamycin B, exhibited better growth 
inhibition of cancerous cells than salinomycin which has progressed into pilot clinical 
trials 90. Though these are only preliminary findings, the results suggest the terrosamycins 
are promising new candidates for development as anticancer agents.  
3.2. THE EFFECTS OF CO-CULTURE MIMIC CONDITIONS ON NATURAL 
PRODUCT PRODUCTION 
 
In the continued search for cryptic natural products, the three actinomycetes K. 
cystarginea, K. griseola and Streptomyces sp. RKND004 were subjected to co-culture 
mimic conditions. The experiments used a group of taxonomically diverse, yet 
ecologically relevant stressor organisms. Metabolomics analysis using MZmine 2 showed 
86 mass features that appeared to be induced with respect to the detection threshold. 
Manual inspection of the raw data revealed 14 of those features were truly induced 
metabolites. Furthermore, 19 were upregulated metabolites. These compounds had few or 

130 
 
no hits in AntiBase suggesting that many of them may be both cryptic and novel natural 
products. 
 
Microbial co-culture is an increasingly popular technique for the induction of 
cryptic natural products. The use of heat-killed cultures as a source of stress has been 
used in the past however the producer/stressor combinations used in this study have never 
before been explored in live co-cultures nor in co-culture mimics. An attempt to find 
optimal concentrations and addition time-points of the stressors was inconclusive; a more 
extensive set of optimization experiments are required. Moreover, the reproducibility of 
the inductions that took place should be confirmed through additional experiments before 
large-scale fermentations and purification of any of the metabolites is pursued. 
3.3. PURIFICATION AND STRUCTURE ELUCIDATION OF PUTATIVELY 
NEW COMPOUNDS FROM INDUCTION EXPERIMENTS 
 
PQS-GlcA, a new biotransformation product was isolated from fermentations of 
Streptomyces sp. RKBH-B178 supplemented with the P. aeruginosa quorum sensing 
molecule HHQ. Similar to both HHQ and PQS, PQS-GlcA is a 2-alkyl-4-quinolone, 
however it possesses a glucuronic acid moiety at the C-3 position. The presence of PQS-
GlcA in fermentations of the bacterium with either HHQ or PQS suggested this 
glucuronidation can occur in both a one-step and two-step process; direct glycosylation of 
the hydroxyl at C-3 of PQS or hydroxylation at C-3 of HHQ followed by the 
glycosylation. An evaluation of quorum sensing activity of HHQ, PQS and PQS-GlcA 
revealed the glucuronidation is a novel method of quorum sensing deactivation; the 
newest of only three currently known methods. Although it is unclear why Streptomyces 
sp. RKBH-B178 is able to perform this biotransformation, this new deactivation 

131 
 
mechanism may find an application in the area of therapeutics targeting P. aeruginosa 
infections which is predominant in the lungs of patients with cystic fibrosis. 
 
In addition to PQS-GlcA, the known compounds bhimamycin A and E were 
purified and characterized from Streptomyces sp. RKBH-B178 fermentations. These 
compounds were previously reported to be produced by a terrestrial streptomycete and 
possess moderate activity against some Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens. 
Interestingly, bhimamycin A showed upregulation in response to both the presence of a 
P. aeruginosa stressor and pure HHQ addition. Despite this upregulation, the compound 
showed no activity against P. aeruginosa. 
3.4. CONCLUDING REMARKS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS 
 
Overall, all three of these studies demonstrated the validity of our approaches to 
unveiling cryptic natural products. Despite being perhaps the most extensively studied 
genus for the production of bioactive compounds, our OSMAC approach using various 
culture media coupled to metabolomics analysis via creation of chemical barcodes led to 
the discovery of the terrosamycins from Streptomyces sp. RKND004. Had Streptomyces 
sp. RKND004 not been subjected to fermentation in these different media, the 
terrosamycins may have never been discovered. Furthermore, subjecting strains from the 
relatively understudied genus Kitasatospora to a variety of culture media generated a list 
of high-priority, putatively novel candidate metabolites for future purification and 
characterization efforts. The results showed that just by simply varying the culture media, 
activation of cryptic gene clusters took place which exposed numerous compounds that 
are awaiting discovery. Though the OSMAC approach is well documented and has been 

132 
 
successful countless times in the past, this project has shown that it remains a useful 
technique and should continue to be used in natural product discovery programs. 
 
The co-culture mimic approach coupled with metabolomics analysis also proved 
to be a useful technique for natural product discovery. Two separate but similar projects 
lead to the identification of induced metabolites, showing that the presence of dead cells 
and secreted biomolecules of stressor organisms triggered the activation of silent gene 
clusters. Though PQS-GlcA is a biotransformation product, and not a true cryptic 
secondary metabolite biosynthesized by the producer bacterium, bioactivity testing 
unveiled a novel quorum sensing deactivation mechanism that may have an important 
application in medicine. This finding demonstrates the validity of co-culture and more 
specifically, co-culture mimic experiments in quorum sensing studies. It also highlights 
the importance of biotransformation products and suggests that the discovery of these 
products may be just as interesting and useful as that of true natural products. Purification 
of the other induced metabolites found from these projects was not pursued and 
verification of their induction through additional experiments should be completed, 
however the list that was generated may be a starting point for future cryptic natural 
product discovery.

4.1. GENERAL EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES  
4.1.1. Origins and maintenance of bacteria and stressor organisms 
The bacterial strains Kitasatospora cystarginea NRRL B-16505 184 and 
Kitasatospora griseola NRRL B-16229 185 were isolated from Japanese soil and were 
obtained from the Agriculture Research Services Culture Collection. The strain 
Streptomyces sp. RKND004 was previously isolated by the Kerr lab from a sediment 
sample collected in Burnt River, Prince Edward Island in August, 2010 (46.19073° N, 
62.48882° W, -43 m in depth). Streptomyces sp. RKBH-B178 was isolated from a 
sediment sample collected in Bonne Bay, Newfoundland in August, 2009. The strains 
were first cultured from glycerol stocks onto ISP2 or ISP3 121 agar plates and incubated at 
30 °C. Liquid seed cultures of each strain were streaked onto TSA 125 plates and 
incubated at 30 °C to check for purity. All plates were stored long term at 4 °C. Fresh 
glycerol stocks of each strain were prepared from plate cultures and stored indefinitely at 
-80 °C. 
 
The fungal stressor organism Aspergillus flavus NRRL 3357 was obtained from 
the Agriculture Research Services Culture Collection. The bacterial stressors Bacillus 
subtilis ATCC 6051 and Mycobacterium smegmatis ATCC 12051 were obtained from the 
American Type Culture Collection. The strains were cultured from glycerol stocks onto 
ISP2 agar plates and incubated at 30 °C. Liquid cultures of each strain were streaked onto 
TSA plates and incubated at 30 °C to check for purity. Plates were stored long term at 4 
°C. Fresh glycerol stocks of each strain were prepared from plate cultures and stored 
indefinitely at -80 °C. 

135 
 
The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans N2 (wild type strain) growing on an agar 
plate with an Escherichia coli OP50 lawn was obtained from the Caenorhabditis Genetics 
Centre (Saint Paul, MN, USA) 163. A scraping of the E. coli lawn was streaked onto a 
fresh NGM agar plate to assess purity. A single colony from the purity plate was scraped 
and used to inoculate 5 mL of sterile diH2O and vortexed for 5 seconds. Lawns of E. coli 
on NGM agar plates were prepared by spreading a 100 μL aliquot in a circle using a 
sterile L-shaped spreader and incubating overnight at 30 °C. Plates were stored long term 
at 4 °C. The nematodes were subcultured onto new E. coli lawns using the chunking 
method: a sterile spatula was used to excise a 1 cm2 section of agar containing many 
nematodes and the chunk was set on top of a new lawn 163. The plates were left at rt for 
four to six days before subculturing onto a fresh plate with an E. coli lawn to maintain the 
nematodes 163. Soft agar freezing solution was used to prepare stocks of C. elegans to be 
stored at -80 °C indefinitely 163. 
4.1.2. Preparation of liquid media 
Recipes for liquid media used in these experiments are listed in Table 2.1. All 
ingredients were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Fisher Scientific, VWR, EMD Millipore 
or BD unless otherwise stated. Media was prepared using Milli-Q quality diH2O from a 
Milli-Q Millipore Biocel water purification system. The pH was adjusted as required 
using 1 M NaOH or 1 M HCl. After preparation, the media were sterilized by autoclaving 
at 122 °C and 16 psi for 20 min. Media for small scale fermentations and seed cultures 
were prepared and sterilized in flasks and then transferred aseptically into sterile 25 × 
150 mm culture tubes containing 4 to 6 glass beads, while media for large scale 
fermentations were prepared and sterilized directly in the appropriate fermentation 

136 
 
vessels as indicated. The purity of each culture was assessed after each seed fermentation 
by streaking the broth onto a TSA plate with a sterile inoculation loop. Purity plates were 
incubated at 30 °C for several days and checked periodically for contamination. 
4.1.3. LC-MS sample preparation and analysis 
Fermentation extracts were resuspended in MeOH to a concentration of 500 
μg/mL and a 10 μL aliquot was analyzed by UHPLC-HRMS using Accela Thermo 
Scientific equipment. A Core Shell 100 Å C18 column (Kintex, 1.7 μm 50 × 2.1 mm) and 
a flow rate of 500 μL/min was used. The solvents used were diH2O with 0.1% formic 
acid (solvent A) and ACN with 0.1% formic acid (solvent B). Each sample was eluted 
with a linear solvent gradient from 5% to 100% solvent B over 4.8 min. This was 
followed by an isocratic elution at 100% solvent B for 3.2 min. Following each run, the 
system was then returned to the starting conditions over 3 min. Eluent was detected by 
HRESIMS using an Exactive Orbitrap mass spectrometer monitoring at m/z 190-2000 in 
positive mode, a Sedex 80 low temperature-evaporative light scattering detector (LT-
ELSD), and a photodiode array (PDA) detector monitoring at 200-600 nm. Reserpine at a 
concentration of 25 μg/mL in MeOH was used as an instrumental control for each batch 
of analysis. Three MeOH blanks were also included in each batch; one at the beginning 
of the batch, one after the reserpine control and one at the end of the batch following the 
experimental samples. 
4.1.4. Characterization of target compounds 
Optical rotations were measured on a Rudolph Autopol III polarimeter using a 50 
mm microcell (1 mL). Infrared spectra were recorded on a Thermo 6700 FTIR 
spectrometer using a SMART iTR attenuated total reflectance accessory. NMR spectra 

137 
 
were obtained on a 600 MHz Bruker Avance III NMR spectrometer equipped with a 
cryoprobe. Chemical shifts (δ) are reported in ppm and were referenced to the MeOD-d4 
residual peaks at δH 3.31 ppm and δC 49.15 ppm. Multiplicities were reported using the 
abbreviations s (singlet), d (doublet), t (triplet), appt (apparent triplet), q (quartet), dd 
(doublet of doublets), dq (doublet of quartets), td (triplet of doublets) and m (multiplet). 
Coupling constants (J) were reported in Hz. UHPLC-HRMS data was recorded using 
Accela Thermo equipment with MS-ELSD-PDA detection as described in the previous 
section. Tandem MS spectra were recorded on a Thermo LTQ Orbitrap Velos mass 
spectrometer and were acquired by direct infusion of the samples (10 μg/mL) at 3 μL/min 
using an ESI source and fragmented using collision-induced dissociation (CID) at 35 eV.  
4.2. THE EFFECTS OF VARYING CULTURE MEDIA ON NATURAL 
PRODUCT PRODUCTION AND THE DISCOVERY OF TERROSAMYCIN A 
AND B 
4.2.1. Identification of Streptomyces sp. RKND004 
Streptomyces sp. RKND004 was fermented in bacterial seed medium 124 (BSM) at 
200 rpm and 30 °C for 72 h. Genomic DNA was isolated using a 
phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol extraction method 186 for use as a template for PCR 
reactions. Primers used for amplification of the 16S rRNA gene were 27F (5'-
AGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG-3') and 1525R (5'-AAGGAGGTGATCCAGCC-3') 187. 
Primers used for amplification of the rpoB gene were SRPOF1 (5'-
TCGATCGGGCACATGCGGCC-3') and SRPOR1 (5'-
TCGACCACTTCGGCAACCGC-3') 117. PCR was performed in total volumes of 25 μL 
consisting of 12.5 μL EconoTaq PLUS GREEN 2x master mix (Lucigen, Middleton, WI, 

138 
 
USA), 1.25 μL DMSO, 7.5 μL diH2O, 0.5 μM of the forward and reverse primers and 
genomic DNA (1.25 μL of a 300 μL dilution). Thermocycler (Eppendorf Mastercycler) 
conditions were as follows: denaturation at 95 °C for 2.5 min, 30 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 
57 °C for 45 s, 72 °C for 1 min, followed by a final extension at 72 °C for 5 min and held 
at 10 °C for storage. Amplicons were assessed for appropriate size using agarose gel 
electrophoresis. 
Sequencing of both 16S rRNA and rpoB amplicons was performed by Eurofins 
MWG Operon (Hunstville, AL, USA). Full-length 16S rRNA gene sequencing (1471 bp) 
was completed using the primers 16S530R, 16S514F, 16S936R, 16S1525R, 16S1114F 
and 16S27F 188. Sequencing of the rpoB gene (253 bp) was completed using the primers 
SRPOF1 and SRPOR1 117. Sequences were analyzed and edited using the software 
program Geneious (Auckland, New Zealand) and compared to existing sequences within 
the NCBI database using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) 119.  
4.2.2. Small-scale fermentations and extractions 
Two successive seed cultures of K. cystarginea, K. griseola, and Streptomyces sp. 
RKND004 were fermented in a 10 mL aliquot of BSM (10 g/L dextrose, 4 g/L yeast 
extract, 0.4 g/L nutrient agar, 15 g/L soluble starch, 1 g/L calcium carbonate, 4 g/L N-Z 
Amine A®). A scraping of a single colony from agar plates was used to inoculate the first 
seed culture for each strain. After fermenting at 200 rpm and 30 °C for 72 h, a 1 mL 
aliquot of the first seed culture was used to inoculate the second 10 mL seed culture 
which was fermented under the same conditions for 48 h. A 10 mL aliquot of each 
production medium (Table 2.1) was then inoculated in triplicate with 300 μL of seed 
culture and fermented under the same conditions for five days. Uninoculated media 

139 
 
blanks were included as negative controls and were subjected to the same fermentation 
conditions. The cultures (126 tubes) and negative controls (14 tubes) were extracted by 
adding 10 mL EtOAc directly to the fermentation tubes and shaking at 200 rpm at rt for 1 
h each time. The organic layers were removed via aspiration with a Pasteur pipette and 
evaporated to dryness. The extracts were resuspended in MeOH to a concentration of 500 
μg/mL and 10 μL aliquots were analyzed by LC-MS over seven batches. 
4.2.3. Data analysis and identification of target compounds 
All raw LC-MS data was first inspected manually for major differences in 
secondary metabolite production as a result of different culture conditions and the mass 
and retention times of interesting metabolites was noted. The data was processed in three 
separate batches, one for each bacterium. Data for all experimental extracts and negative 
controls were processed as previously described by our group 41 with a number of 
additions. First, the Xcalibur (Thermo Scientific software) file converter was used to 
convert .RAW files generated by the instrument for each sample into their respective 
.CDF files. The .CDF files were imported into the open-source software program 
MZmine 2 133. In MZmine 2, mass detection was performed using the exact mass 
parameter with an intensity threshold set at 1E4, m/z tolerance was defined at 0.005 and 
tR tolerance was defined at 0.01 min. Default settings were used for all subsequent 
parameters. Chromatogram building and de-isotoping was carried out as previously 
described 41, with the addition of a chromatogram deconvolution step between them. 
Linear normalization using the maximum peak intensity method was then applied; 
individual files were normalized by dividing the area of each peak by the area of the 
largest peak within that sample. Bucket alignment was performed 41 and a peak list was 

140 
 
generated. Gap filling using the peak finder method with default settings was applied in 
order ensure detection of mass features that may be present in some scans but not others. 
Mass features that were present in the negative controls, MeOH and reserpine samples 
were manually removed from the peak list. The processed peak list was exported as a 
.CSV file and presence-absence chemical barcodes were created using conditional 
formatting. Mass features with a peak area equal to zero were coloured white while those 
with a peak area greater than zero were coloured black. In MZmine 2, the processed peak 
list was used to create ion intensity plots for visualization of relative quantities of specific 
metabolites produced by a strain across all conditions screened. The masses of [M+H]+, 
[M-H]- or [M+Na]+ pseudomolecular ions of interesting metabolites were queried in the 
natural products database AntiBase 134 and the chemical database SciFinder to identify 
putatively novel compounds. 
4.2.4. Large-scale fermentations and purification of terrosamycin A and B 
Two successive seed cultures of Streptomyces sp. RKND004 were fermented as 
previously described (section 4.2.2). A total volume of 9 L (9 × 1 L in Fernbach flasks) 
of BFM3 was fermented with a 2.9% (v/v) inoculum from seed cultures for five days at 
200 rpm and 30 °C. Each culture flask was extracted twice with 400 mL EtOAc 
overnight at rt and the organic layers were combined and evaporated to dryness. The 
resulting extract was fractionated by automated flash chromatography using a Combiflash 
Rf (Teledyne ISCO) system with a 43 g C18 column (High Performance GOLD, RediSep 
Rf) and eluted with a flow rate of 20 mL/min. A linear gradient from 1:9 MeOH:diH2O to 
100% MeOH over 24 min followed by 100% MeOH for 10 min was used and eluent was 
detected by UV at 214 and 254 nm. Fractions containing terrosamycin A and B eluted at 

141 
 
32.5-34.0 min and were combined and further separated via automated flash 
chromatography with a 12 g silica column (High Performance GOLD, RediSep Rf). The 
mixture was eluted at 30 mL/min with a gradient of 2:8 acetone:hexanes to 100% acetone 
over 18 min followed by 100% acetone for 20 min. The eluent was detected by UV at 
214 and 254 nm. Terrosamycin A (1) and B (2) eluted at 3.0 min and 4.0 min, 
respectively.  
Terrosamycin A (1): colourless glass; [α]28D -77 (c 0.25, MeOH); IR νmax 3331, 
2968, 2924, 1714, 1577, 1456, 1377, 1105, 1087, 1066, 1042, 1001 cm-1; 1H and 13C 
NMR data see Table 2.3; (-) HRESIMS m/z 811.5205 [M-H]- (calcd for C44H75O13, 
811.52132).  
Terrosamycin B (2):  colourless glass; [α]27D -141 (c 1.08, MeOH); IR νmax 3479, 
2962, 2929, 2854, 1710, 1458, 1378, 1189, 1086, 1067, 1053, 1002 cm-1; 1H and 13C 
NMR data see Table 2.3; (-) HRESIMS m/z 839.5504 [M-H]- (calcd for C46H79O13, 
839.55262).  
4.2.5. Crystallization of terrosamycin A and analysis of X-ray diffraction data 
Terrosamycin A was dissolved in 50% aqueous ethanol and converted to a salt by 
adding NaOH dropwise until the pH was higher than 11. The sample was dried under air 
and resuspended in 0.5 mL acetone and five drops of diH2O. Crystals were grown using a 
slow solvent evaporation method at 4 C over about one month. The mother liquor was 
removed via aspiration with a syringe and the crystals were sent to Dr. Andreas Decken 
at the University of New Brunswick in Fredericton, New Brunswick who performed 
XRD analysis and structure refinement. Single crystals were coated with Paratone-N oil, 

142 
 
mounted using a polyimide MicroMount and frozen in the cold nitrogen stream of the 
goniometer. A hemisphere of data was collected on a Bruker AXS P4/SMART 1000 
diffractometer using  and  scans with a scan width of 0.3 and 10 s exposure times. 
The detector distance was 5 cm. The data were reduced (SAINT) 189 and corrected for 
absorption (SADABS) 190. The structure was solved by direct methods and refined by 
full-matrix least squares on F2 (SHELXTL) 191. The acetone molecule was disordered 
over two positions. All non-hydrogen atoms were refined using anisotropic displacement 
parameters. Hydrogen atoms were included in calculated positions and refined using a 
riding model with the exception of hydrogen atoms of potassium (K) bound hydroxides 
that were found in Fourier difference maps and refined using bond distance restraints. 
The crystal structure was visualized using the open-source software package CRYSTALS 
and images were created using the built-in Cameron package. 
Crystal Data for terrosamycin A (1): C44H75KO13; fw = 889.19; monoclinic space 
group P2(1); unit cell dimensions a = 12.004(3) Å, b = 35.796(10) Å, c = 12.020(3) Å, V 
= 5015(2) Å
3,  = 90°,  = 103.826(4)°,  = 90°; μ(Cu Kα) = 0.166 mm-1; Z = 4; Dcalc = 
1.178 Mg/m3; 34 113 reflections measured (1.74° ≤ 2θ ≤ 27.50°), 21746 independent [Rint 
= 0.0760], which were used in all calculations. The final R1 was 0.0770 [I > 2σ(I)] and 
wR2 was 0.1886 (all data). 
4.2.6. Bioactivity of terrosamycin A and B 
The antimicrobial activity of 1 and 2 was evaluated using panel of human 
microbial pathogens including methicillin-resistant S. aureus ATCC 33591 (MRSA), 
vancomycin resistant E. faecium EF379 (VRE), S. warneri ATCC 17917, P. 
aeruginosa ATCC 14210, P. vulgaris ATCC 12454 and C. albicans ATCC 14035. 

143 
 
Assays were performed by technician Martin Lanteigne of the Kerr lab according to 
Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute testing standards in a 96-well plate and in 
triplicate 192. Terrosamycin A and B were dissolved in sterile 20% DMSO and serially 
diluted creating a range of twelve concentrations between 128 μg/mL and 0.0625 μg/mL. 
A Thermo Scientific Varioskan Flash plate reader was used to determine cell growth by 
measuring the optical density at 600 nm at time zero and after incubation at 37 ºC for 22 
h. The change in OD600 was calculated, percentages of microorganism survival were 
compared to the vehicle control wells and IC50 values were determined. Control 
antibiotics used were vancomycin for MRSA and S. warneri, rifampicin for VRE, 
gentamycin for P. aeruginosa, ciprofloxacin for P. vulgaris and nystatin for C. albicans. 
The cytotoxicity of 1 and 2 was evaluated using two healthy cell lines, human 
foreskin fibroblast cells (BJ, ATCC CRL-2522) and Cercopithecus aethiops kidney 
epithelial cells (Vero, ATCC CCL-81) as well as two cancer cell lines, human breast 
adenocarcinoma cells (ATCC HTB-26) and human invasive breast ductal carcinoma cells 
(ATCC MCF-7). Assays were performed by technician Kate McQuillan of Nautilus 
Biosciences Inc. Each cell line was grown and maintained in 15 mL of Eagle’s Minimal 
Essential Medium in T75 cm2 cell culture flasks with the exception of HTB-26 cells 
which were grown in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium/Nutrient Mixture F-12 Ham. 
All growth media was supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 μU/mL penicillin 
and 0.1 mg/mL streptomycin; the growth medium for MCF-7 cells was also 
supplemented with 0.01 mg/mL human recombinant insulin. All cell cultures were 
incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 and culture media was 
refreshed every two to three days. The cells were not allowed to exceed 80% confluency. 

144 
 
At 80% confluency the cells were counted and diluted in their respective growth 
medium without addition of antibiotics. Aliquots of 90 μL were added to a microwell 
plate at a density of 1 × 104 cells/well for Vero and HTB-26 cells and 5 × 103 cells/well 
for BJ fibroblast and MCF-7 cells. The plates were incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 
24 h to allow cells to adhere to the plates prior to treatment. The vehicle DMSO was used 
to dissolve 1 and 2 and was present at a final concentration of 1% in each of the wells. A 
dilution series was prepared for each cell line using the respective growth medium and 10 
μL aliquots of each was added to the respective plate in concentrations ranging from 128 
μg/mL to 1 μg/mL in triplicate. Positive control wells contained only the growth medium 
and DMSO, negative control wells contained the growth medium, DMSO and cells and 
positive treated controls contained the growth medium, cells and a concentration range of 
either zinc pyrithione (BJ fibroblast), phenoxyethanol (Vero), or doxorubicin (HTB-26 
and MCF-7). All plates were incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 24 h (BJ fibroblast, 
Vero) or 72 h (HTB-26, MCF-7). Following incubation, alamarBlue® was added to each 
well at a concentration of 10% (v/v). Fluorescence was measured at 560 nm excitation 
and 590 nm emission using a Thermo Scientific Varioskan Flash plate reader at time zero 
and 4 h after treatment with alamarBlue®. The change in 590 nm emission reading was 
used to calculate percent cell viability after each treatment relative to the negative 
controls. The IC50 values of 1 and 2 for each cell line was calculated using GraphPad 
Prism 6.0 using a nonlinear regression dose response, variable slope model and standard 
deviation was calculated based on triplicate measurements. 

145 
 
4.3. THE EFFECTS OF CO-CULTURE MIMIC CONDITIONS ON NATURAL 
PRODUCT PRODUCTION 
4.3.1. Preparation of stressors 
Two successive seed cultures of the fungal stressor A. flavus and the bacterial 
stressors B. subtilis and M. smegmatis were fermented in a 10 mL portion of BHI 193 
broth (premix, BD). A scraping of a single colony from the agar plates was used to 
inoculate the first seed culture for each bacterial strain, while a 1 cm2 section of agar was 
excised and used to inoculate the first seed culture of A. flavus. After fermenting at 200 
rpm and 30 °C for 72 h, a 1 mL aliquot of the first seed culture was used to inoculate the 
second 10 mL seed culture which was fermented under the same conditions for 48 h. A 
volume of 500 mL of BHI broth in Fernbach flasks was inoculated with 2.5 mL of seed 
culture for each strain and fermented for five days at 200 rpm and 30 °C. 
A large-scale fermentation of E. coli was completed using a scraping of a single 
colony from a purity plate to directly inoculate 2 L (2 × 1L in Fernbach flasks) of 
Lysogeny broth (LB) (premix, EMD Millipore). The culture was allowed to grow 
overnight at 200 rpm and 37 °C. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation (2 × 1L in 
sterile centrifuge tubes, 6000 rpm for 10 min) and the supernatant was removed via 
aspiration. Each pellet was resuspended in 50 mL S medium 163 and each was added to 
200 mL S medium in 1L Erlenmeyer flasks. S medium (5 mL per plate) was used to wash 
four NGM agar plates containing C. elegans on a freshly cleared lawn of E. coli. The 
washes were collected and added to one of the two E. coli inoculated flasks while the 
other flask remained axenic to be used as a control for co-culture mimic fermentations. 

146 
 
Both cultures were fermented at rt and 200 rpm for 72 h. Nematode growth was 
monitored daily by viewing a drop of the culture under a compound microscope. 
All stressor cultures were killed by autoclaving at 122 °C and 16 psi for 20 min. 
The fungal culture of A. flavus was homogenized prior to autoclaving with a hand-held 
blender. All cultures were checked for purity before autoclaving by streaking onto a TSA 
plate (A. flavus, B. subtilis and M. smegmatis) or NGM agar plate (C. elegans/E. coli and 
E. coli). The cultures were also streaked post-autoclaving to ensure sterilization. A 100-
fold dilution of each stressor (including the axenic E. coli control) was prepared by 
adding 20 mL of the dead culture to 180 mL sterile diH2O. A control for co-culture 
mimic fermentations with A. flavus, B. subtilis and M. smegmatis was prepared using 
twice-autoclaved liquid BHI medium and performing a 100-fold dilution as described 
above. The stressors and controls, both concentrated and dilute solutions, were stored in 
sterile, sealed bottles covered in aluminum foil at 4 °C.  
4.3.2. Small-scale fermentations and extractions 
Seed cultures of K. cystarginea, K. griseola and Streptomyces sp. RKND004 were 
inoculated from agar plates and fermented as previously described (section 4.2.2). Tubes 
containing 9 mL of the production medium BFM4 were inoculated with 300 μL aliquots 
of seed culture; 20 tubes were inoculated for each strain. Uninoculated fermentations 
containing only BFM4 (six tubes) were included as media blanks. All cultures and blanks 
were fermented at 200 rpm and 30°C for 48 h before addition of the stressors. For each 
strain, 1 mL of each stressor (six stressors: A. flavus, B. subtilis and M. smegmatis both 
concentrated and 100-fold diluted), was added to a culture in triplicate accounting for 18 
tubes. The remaining two tubes were designated as no-stress controls; one receiving 1 mL 

147 
 
of twice-autoclaved BHI and the other receiving 1 mL of the 100-fold diluted twice-
autoclaved BHI. Each of the six media blanks were treated with one of the six stressors. 
All cultures and blanks were fermented under the same conditions for 72 h further. Each 
of the 66 tubes was extracted as previously described (section 4.2.2). The extracts were 
resuspended in MeOH to a concentration of 500 μg/mL and 10 μL aliquots were analyzed 
by LC-MS over two batches. 
Tubes containing 9 mL of the production medium BFM3 were inoculated with 
300 μL aliquots of seed culture; 16 tubes were inoculated for each strain (including four 
control tubes). Uninoculated fermentations containing only BFM3 (four tubes) were 
included as media blanks. At the time of inoculation (day 0), 1 mL of either stressor 
(concentrated or 100-fold diluted C. elegans/E. coli) was added to a culture in triplicate 
accounting for six tubes. Each stressor was also added to a media blank tube. To two of 
the four control tubes, either concentrated or diluted axenic E. coli control stressor was 
added. All cultures and blanks were fermented at 200 rpm and 30 °C for four days. On 
day 4, the stressors were added in the same way to the remaining cultures, control 
cultures and media blanks. All tubes were fermented under the same conditions for a 
further 24 h. Each of the 52 tubes was extracted as previously described (section 4.2.2). 
The extracts were resuspended in MeOH to a concentration of 500 μg/mL and 10 μL 
aliquots were analyzed by LC-MS over two batches. 
4.3.3. Data analysis and identification of upregulated and induced compounds 
Raw LC-MS data was inspected manually and processed using MZmine 2 as 
previously described (section 4.2.2). Data for each strain grown with each stressor (each 
set including data from media blanks and BHI added or E. coli added controls) was 

148 
 
processed separately. The gap-filled peak list was inspected and any mass features 
detected in the media blanks were deleted from the entire data set. The list was annotated 
with possible compound identities for each mass feature by uploading the AntiBase 
database under the custom database search function. Scatter plots comparing mass 
features present in stressor-treated cultures with no-stress controls were constructed in 
MZmine 2. Mass features present in the controls were then deleted from the peak list 
leaving only putatively induced metabolites. Further, features that were not induced in all 
three replicates of a given condition were also deleted from the list. The 86 remaining 
features were located in the raw LC-MS data using XICs. Features that appeared to be 
part of the noise were eliminated from the list. The control and blank samples were 
checked for the presence of the remaining genuine metabolites and those that were 
present in the blanks were also removed from the list. The remaining metabolites were 
classified as upregulated or induced based on their presence or absence XICs of the 
controls (Table 2.8). 
4.4. PURIFICATION AND STRUCTURE ELUDICATION OF PQS-GLCA 
4.4.1. Multi-scale fermentations and extractions 
Two successive seed cultures of Streptomyces sp. RKBH-B178 were fermented in 
10 mL portions of ISP2 broth. A scraping of a single colony from the strain growing on a 
TSA plate was used to inoculate the first seed culture. After fermenting at 200 rpm and 
30 °C for 24 h, a 1 mL aliquot of the first seed cultures were used to inoculate the second 
10 mL seed cultures which were fermented under the same conditions for 48 h. A 3% 
(v/v) aliquot of seed culture was used to inoculate 118 tubes containing 7 mL ISP2 broth, 
two 250 mL Erlenmeyer flasks containing 50 mL ISP2 broth, one Fernbach flask 

149 
 
containing 600 mL ISP2 broth and one Fernbach flask containing 1 L ISP2 broth. All 
cultures were fermented at 200 rpm and 30 °C for 48 h before addition of HHQ (3.38 μg 
of HHQ per mL of fermentation broth). Fermentations continued for 72 h. Two media 
blanks in tubes were included as negative controls; one for ISP2 and one for ISP2 with 
added HHQ. A positive control containing ISP2 inoculated with Streptomyces sp. RKBH-
B178 was also included. Cultures in tubes were extracted twice with 7 mL EtOAc at 200 
rpm and rt for 1 h. Larger scale cultures were extracted twice with EtOAc at rt and 
swirled by hand periodically for 1 h; cultures in 250 mL flasks were extracted with 50 
mL and cultures in Fernbach flasks were extracted with 600 mL. The extracts were 
resuspended in MeOH to a concentration of 500 μg/mL and 10 μL aliquots were analyzed 
by LC-MS in one batch.  
4.4.2. Large-scale fermentations and purification of PQS-GlcA 
A large-scale fermentation was completed by Ph. D. student Libang Liang. Two 
successive seed cultures of Streptomyces sp. RKBH B178 were fermented for 72 h each 
as previously described (section 4.2.2). A total volume of 2.95 L (59 × 50 mL in 250 mL 
flasks) of the production medium ISP2 was fermented with a 3% (v/v) inoculum from 
seed cultures and 25 μM HHQ for 6 days at 200 rpm and 30 °C. Each culture flask was 
extracted twice with 50 mL EtOAc for 1 h at rt and 200 rpm and the organic layers were 
combined, washed twice with diH2O in a separatory funnel and evaporated to dryness.  
The resulting extract was fractionated by automated flash chromatography using a 
Combiflash Rf (Teledyne ISCO) system with a 43 g C18 column (High Performance 
GOLD, RediSep Rf) and eluted with a flow rate of 40 mL/min. A linear gradient from 1:9 
MeOH:diH2O to 100% MeOH over 21 min followed by 100% MeOH for 5 min was used 

150 
 
and eluent was detected by UV at 250 and 280 nm. Fractions containing PQS-GlcA (3) 
eluted at 15.0 – 17.5 min and were combined and further separated via subsequent 
automated flash chromatography using a 13 g C18 column (High Performance GOLD, 
RediSep Rf) with a flow rate of 30 mL/min. An isocratic elution of 1:1 diH2O:ACN for 6 
min was used, followed by a steep gradient to 100% ACN over 1 min and held at 100% 
ACN for 2.5 min. The eluent was detected by UV at 254 and 278 nm. PQS-GlcA eluted 
at 0.8 min.  
PQS-GlcA (3) was purified by RP-HPLC with a Luna 110 Å phenyl hexyl 
column (5 μm, 250 × 10.00 mm, Phenomenex). An isocratic elution with 55% diH2O 
with 0.1% formic acid (solvent A) and 45% ACN with 0.1% formic acid (solvent B) over 
15 min was used, followed by a linear increase to 100% solvent B over 1 min and held at 
100% solvent B for 10 min. The eluent was monitored by ELSD and UV at 238 and 321 
nm. PQS-GlcA eluted at 8.9 min.  
PQS-GlcA (3): yellow oil; [α]30D -252 (c 0.04), MeOH); λmax 239, 231 nm; IR νmax 
3278, 2929, 2814, 2188, 2036, 1611, 1517, 1352, 1115 cm-1; 1H and 13C NMR see Table 
2.8; (+) HRESIMS m/z 436.1961 [M+H]+ (calcd for C22H30NO8, 436.19659).  
4.4.3. Stereochemical determination of PQS-GlcA by Tanaka’s method 
The configuration of the GlcA moiety in PQS-GlcA (3) was determined using 
Tanaka’s method 172, 173. PQS-GlcA (100 μg) was dissolved in 10 μL tetrahydrofuran 
(THF) and 40 μL diH2O. Hydrolysis was performed overnight by adding 50 μL 2M HCl 
and incubating at 95 °C in a sealed reaction vessel. The reaction mixture was evaporated 
to dryness, resuspended in 50 μL of a 1 mg/mL D-cysteine methyl ester (Tokyo Chemical 

151 
 
Industry, Portland OR, USA) stock solution and sonicated until all particulate matter was 
dissolved. After incubation at 60 °C for 1 h, 0.5 μL o-tolylisothiocyanate (Sigma-Aldrich, 
St. Louis, MO, USA) (neat) was added and the reaction was mixed well and incubated 
again at 60 °C for 1 h. The D-D and D-L Tanaka derivative standards were prepared 
using a similar protocol; two additional reactions were performed with commercial D-
GlcA (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA)  being reacted either with D-cysteine methyl 
ester or L-cysteine  methyl ester (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) to yield the 
appropriate products. The reaction mixtures were evaporated to dryness and resuspended 
in MeOH to a concentration of 500 μg/mL. A 10 μL aliquot was analyzed by LC-HRMS 
using a Hypersil Gold 100 Å column (Thermo, 1.9 μm C18 50 × 2.1 mm) with a flow rate 
of 400 μL/min. An isocratic elution of 87% diH2O 0.1% formic acid (solvent A) and 13% 
MeOH 0.1% formic acid (solvent B) over 20 minutes was used, followed by a linear 
gradient to 30% solvent B over 8 min and held for 2 min. This was followed by another 
linear gradient to 100% solvent B over 2 min, held at 100% for 6 min, and a linear 
decrease to 13% solvent B over 4 min and held for 2.8 min. Eluent was detected by 
HRESIMS monitoring at m/z 190-2000 in positive mode. Retention times of the Tanaka 
derivatives were as follows: D-GlcA/D-cysteine methyl ester 25.28 min, D-GlcA/L-
cysteine methyl ester 26.96 min, PQS-GlcA/D-cysteine methyl ester 25.28 min.
