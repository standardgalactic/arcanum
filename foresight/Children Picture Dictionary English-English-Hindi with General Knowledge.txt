NATURAL NUMBERS 
(OR) COUNTING 
NUMBERS 
All the numbers starting from 
ONE are called "NATURAL" 
numbers, (i.e.) 
N = {1,2,3,4,5,6 
} 
WHOLE 
NUMBERS 
All natural numbers 
along with ZERO (0) 
are called "WHOLE" 
numbers, (i.e.) 
W = {0,1,2,3,4 
} 
EVEN NUMBERS 
Any number which is exactly 
divisible by 2 is called an 
"EVEN" number. Example : 
2,4,6,8,10,14,48,56,120 etc 
Note : If the last figure of a 
number is 0,2,4,6 or 8 the 
number is EVEN. 
ODD NUMBERS 
Any number which is NOT exactly divisible by 2 is called an "ODD" number. 
Example: 1,3,5,7,9,21,125 etc. 
.Note : If the last figure of a number is 1,3,5,7 or 9,the number is ODD. 
<m) 

PRIME NUMBERS 
Any number which is divisible only by 
1 and by itself is called a "PRIME" 
number. The 25 prime numbers below 
100 are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 
31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 
79, 83, 89 and 97 
Note : 2 is the only even number which 
is prime. 
FRACTIONAL NUMBERS : 
(FRACTIONS) 
Any number which is a part of a whole 
is 
called 
a 
"FRACTION". 
These 
numbers are written as 
1/2, 2/5, 3/5, 5/6 etc. 1/2 is a part of 1 
(whole)

SQUARES OF NUMBERS 
Any number obtained by multiplying a 
number 
once 
by 
itself 
is 
the 
"SQUARE" of the number, 
e.g. 4x4 gives 16. Therefore 16 is the 
square of 4. 
5x5 gives 25. Therefore 25 is the 
square of 5.

CUBES OF NUMBERS 
Any number obtained by multiplying a 
number twice by itself is the "CUBE" 
of that number. 
e.g. 3x3x3 gives 27. Therefore 27 is the 
cube of 3. 
6> 
DECIMAL NUMBERS 
Fractional 
numbers 
can 
also 
be 
indicated by placing a dot called the 
"DECIMAL POINT". 
e.g. the fraction 1/4 can be written as 
0.25 
1/2 can be written as 0.50 
3/4 can be written as 0.75 
In English, a point (.) is use instead of a 
comma when writing decimals. We also 
say point when speaking the number. 
The stress falls on the last figure : 
15.2 (fifteen point two) 
If there is more than one figure after 
the 
decimal 
point, 
we 
say 
each 
separately: 
15.25 fifteen point two five 
3.142 three point one four two 
In numbers less than one, for example 
0.15, we say zero point one five, point 
one five or, some times in British 
English, nought point one five.

ROMAN NUMBERS 
Roman numerals are not widely used, but used often enough so you should be able to 
read or interpret them. Following is a table of Arabic Numerals and their equivalent 
Roman Numerals.

/ The following examples illustrate the use and meaning of Roman Numerals. 
1. A Roman Numeral or letter preceding a letter of greater value subtracts from it : 
V = 5 
IV = 4 
L = 50 
XL = 40 
C = 100 
XC = 90 
2. A letter preceding a letter of equal of lesser value adds to it. 
V = 5 
VI = 6 
L = 50 
LX = 60 
C = 100 
CXI = 111 
3. You will quickly, of course, be able to remember and recognize smaller numbers. 
XVI = 16 
X (10) + VI (6) = 16 
XLIV = 44 
XL (40) + IV (4) = 44 
XCI = 91 
XC (90) + I (1) = 91 
For larger number simply examine the numbers and break it down into its elements 
and you will readily interpret the number. You will be able to recognize the elements or 
parts by applying rules 1 and 2 given above or by looking at the table of Roman 
Numerals. 
CDXCIII = 493 
CD (400) + XC (90) + III (3) = 493 
MDCLXXV = 1,675 
M (1,000) + DC (600) + LXX (70) 
+ V (5) = 1,675 
DCXCIX = 699 
DC (600) + DC (90) + IX (9) = 699 
4. A bar over a Roman Numeral multiplies it by 1,000. 
MV = 4,000 
V = 5,000 
XV = 15,000 
XX = 20,000

Degree Celsius or Degree Centigrade (°C) 
The most widely used unit of temperature. 
There are 100 degrees Celsius between the 
normal freezing point of water (0°C) and the 
boiling point of water (100°C). 
DEGREE FAHRENHEIT (°F) 
The unit of temperature 
There are 180 degrees Fahrenheit between 
the freezing point (32°F) and the boiling point 
(212°F) of water. To convert °F to °C, subtract 
32, multiply by 5, and divide by 9. 
KELVIN (K)

PREFIXES FOR UNITS 
An international unit of measurement used in science 
SI stands for Systeme International, which is French for "international system". The 
system of SI units has been agreed for international use, so that scientists around the 
world can all record the results of their experiments and make their calculations using 
the same units. One example of an SI unit is the metre. This is the SI unit of length, and 
equals the distance that light travels in 1/299,792,458 of a second through a vacuum. 
Light is used as a standard because it has a constant speed.

Basic SI units and derived SI units 
The seven basic units have scientific 
standards that define the size of the units 
with great precision. The metre and its 
standard are given in the entry above on 
SI units. Other basic units and derived 
units 
also 
have 
their 
own 
entries 
elsewhere in the dictionary.

Using multiples and 
submultiples 
Multiples and submultiples allow one unit to be 
used whatever the amount measured. For 
example, 1 kilogram (1 kg) is 1,000 grams, and I 
milligram (1 mg) is one-thousandth of a gram. 
Large masses are measured in kilograms, and 
small masses in milligrams, as shown on the 
fright.
