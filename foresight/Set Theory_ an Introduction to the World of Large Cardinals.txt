The language of set theory
The formal language of set theory is the ﬁrst-order language,
with equality, whose only non-logical symbol is the binary
relation symbol ∈. The formulas of the language are deﬁned
recursively, as follows:
1
Atomic formulas are of the form x = y or x ∈y.
2
If ϕ and ψ are formulas, then so are ¬ϕ, (ϕ ∧ψ), (ϕ ∨ψ),
(ϕ →ψ), and (ϕ ↔ψ).
3
If ϕ is a formula, then so are ∀xϕ and ∃xϕ.
Parentheses may be added after a quantiﬁer to facilitate the
reading, and may be omitted if the formula can be read without
ambiguity.

The language of set theory
A variable is said to occur free in a formula if it does not fall
within the range of any quantiﬁer.
A formula with no variables occurring free in it is called a
sentence.

The ZFC axioms
We will work in the ZFC (Zermelo-Fraenkel with Choice) axiom
system, which is the standard theory of sets. We state the ZFC
axioms both informally and formalized in the language of set
theory. As is customary, we write ∀x ∈a (. . .) for
∀x(x ∈a →. . .), and ∃x ∈a (. . .) for ∃x(x ∈a ∧. . .). The actual
formal axioms are the universal closure of the displayed
formulas.
Extensionality: If two sets a and b have the same elements,
then they are equal.
∀x(x ∈a ↔x ∈b) →a = b
Pair: Given any sets a and b, there exists a set containing a
and b as elements.
∃x(a ∈x ∧b ∈x)

subsets of a.
∃x∀y(∀z ∈y(z ∈a) →y ∈x)
Inﬁnity: There exists an inﬁnite set.
∃x(∃y(y ∈x) ∧∀y ∈x∃z ∈x(y ∈z))
Foundation: Every non-empty set a contains an ∈-minimal
element.

Separation: For every set a and every property, there is a set

for every formula ϕ(y) of the language of set theory in which x
does not occur free and which may have other free variables.
So this is an inﬁnite list of axioms, one for each such formula
ϕ(y).
Replacement: For every deﬁnable (multivalued) function on a
set a, there is a set containing all the values of the function.
∀x ∈a∃yϕ(x, y) →∃z∀x ∈a∃y ∈z ϕ(x, y)
for every formula ϕ(x, y) of the language of set theory in which
z does not occur free and which may have other free variables.

ϕ(x, y).

Choice: For every set a of pairwise disjoint non-empty sets,
there exists a set that contains exactly one element from each
set in a.
AC is equivalent, modulo the Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms, to
Zermelo’s Well-Ordering Principle: Every set can be
well-ordered. That is, for every set a there exists an ordering
relation on a that is a well-order. (Recall that a well-order of a is
a linear ordering of a in which every non-empty subset of a has
a least element.)

Sets versus proper classes
Some collections are not sets. For example, the collection of all
sets, V, is not a set. Otherwise, by the Separation axiom, there
exists a set A =: {x ∈V : x ̸∈x}. But then A ∈A if and only if
A ̸∈A. This is known as Russell’s Paradox.
Collections that are not sets are called proper classes. In ZFC,
proper classes are given by a formula, as in the previous
example A was given by the formula x ̸∈x. Another example is
the proper class of all sets, V, which is given by the formula
x = x.

Ordinals
A set A is transitive if it contains all elements of its elements.
An ordinal number, or simply an ordinal, is a transitive set
well-ordered by ∈.
The empty set ∅is an ordinal.
If α and β are ordinal numbers, then α ∈β if and only if α ⊂β.
Thus, α ∈β if and only if α is a proper ∈-initial segment of β. It
follows that every ordinal α is precisely the set of all its
∈-predecessors, which are themselves ordinals.
We usually write α < β for α ⊂β, and α ≤β for α ⊆β. Thus,
for all ordinal numbers α and β, either α < β, or β < α, or
α = β.

Ordinals
The (immediate) successor of an ordinal α is the ordinal
α ∪{α}, usually denoted by α + 1.
If X is a set of ordinals, then S X is also an ordinal.
The ordinals form a proper class, denoted by Ωor OR, which is
well-ordered by ≤.
A limit ordinal is an ordinal that is neither empty nor a
successor.
The natural numbers are identiﬁed with the ﬁnite ordinals.
Thus, 0 = ∅, 1 = {0}, 2 = {0, 1}, and so on. The set N of
natural numbers is thus identiﬁed with the ﬁrst inﬁnite ordinal
number, which is also the ﬁrst limit ordinal, and is denoted by ω.

Ordinals
An ordinal is countable if it is either ﬁnite or bijectable with ω.
The set of all countable ordinals is not countable and is,
therefore, the ﬁrst uncountable ordinal, denoted by ω1.
The set of all ordinals bijectable with some α ≤ω1 is an ordinal
that is not bijectable with any α ≤ω1 and is denoted by ω2. And
so on.
A limit ordinal α is called regular if there is no function f : β →α
with β < α and range(f) unbounded in α. Otherwise, α is called
singular.
The coﬁnality of α (denoted by cof(α)) is the least β ≤α for
which there exists f : β →α with range coﬁnal, i.e., unbounded,
in α. Thus, α is regular if and only if cof(α) = α.

Ordinals
All the ordinals ω, ω1, ω2, . . . are regular. The limit of all these,
that is, S
n ωn, is a singular ordinal, denoted by ωω.
By the Well-Ordering Principle, every set can be well-ordered.
And every well-ordered set X is order-isomorphic to a unique
ordinal, denoted by otp(X), the order-type of X.

The universe of all sets
In ZFC, one can prove that the universe of all sets V forms a
cumulative hierarchy. That is, every set belongs to some Vα, for
some ordinal α, where the Vα are deﬁned as follows:
V0 = ∅
Vα+1 = P(Vα), the power set of Vα.
Vλ = S
α<λ Vα, if λ is a limit ordinal.
Then, V = S
α∈ΩVα is the universe of all sets.
Notice that α ≤β implies Vα ⊆Vβ.
One can easily see, by transﬁnite induction on the ordinals α,
that all the Vα are transitive sets.

Cardinals
A cardinal number (or simply, a cardinal) is an ordinal that is not
bijectable with any smaller ordinal. Thus, all natural numbers
are cardinals, and so are ω, ω1, ω2, . . . , ωω, . . .
Every inﬁnite cardinal is a limit ordinal.
Given an inﬁnite cardinal κ, the set of all ordinals that are
bijectable with some λ ≤κ is a cardinal; it is the least cardinal
greater than κ, and is usually denoted by κ+. Moreover, if X is
a set of cardinals, then S X is also a cardinal. Hence, the
cardinals form a proper class contained in Ω.

Cardinals
The transﬁnite sequence of all inﬁnite cardinals is denoted,
following Cantor, by the Hebrew letter ℵ(aleph) sub-indexed by
ordinals. Thus,
ℵ0, ℵ1, ℵ2, . . . , ℵω, ℵω+1, . . . , ℵα, . . .
Notice that ℵn = ωn, for all n < ω.
The Well-Ordering Principle implies that every set has a
cardinality, i.e., is bijectable with a (unique) cardinal ℵα. The
cardinal ℵα is called the cardinality of X and is denoted by |X|.

Some cardinal arithmetic
Let κ, λ be cardinals.
The sum κ + λ is deﬁned as |κ × {0} ∪λ × {1}|.
The product κ · λ is deﬁned as |κ × λ|.
The exponentiation is deﬁned as κλ = | Q
α<λ κ|. Equivalently,
the cardinality of the set of all functions from λ into κ.
Since for every inﬁnite cardinal κ there is a canonical bijection
between κ × κ and κ, it follows that κ · κ = κ, and therefore for
all inﬁnite cardinals κ and λ,
κ + λ = κ · λ = max{κ, λ}.

Some cardinal arithmetic
Cantor’s Theorem states that |A| > |P(A)|, for every set A.
Hence, 2κ > κ, for every cardinal κ.
Another result one can prove in ZFC about inﬁnite cardinal
exponentiation is that κcof(κ) > κ, for every inﬁnite cardinal κ.
But, unfortunately, this is almost all one can prove in ZFC about
cardinal exponentiation without extra assumptions and
assuming, of course, that ZFC is consistent.

Models, consistency, and independence
Since ZFC is a recursive axiom system in which arithmetic is
formalizable, it is subject to Gödel’s Second Incompleteness
Theorem. Namely, if ZFC is consistent, i.e., no contradiction
can be logically derived from it, then ZFC cannot prove its own
consistency.
However, we do believe ZFC is consistent, since all ZFC
axioms are true in V.

Models, consistency, and independence
A structure for the language of set theory is a pair ⟨M, E⟩,
where M is a set or a proper class and E is a binary relation on
M. We say that ⟨M, E⟩is a model of ZFC if all ZFC axioms are
true in ⟨M, E⟩whenever we interpret the variables as ranging
over elements of M and we interpret ∈as E. We sometimes
consider also models of fragments of ZFC.
A model ⟨M, E⟩is called standard if E is ∈, that is, the
membership relation between sets. Namely, E =∈∩(M × M). If
⟨M, E⟩is standard, then we usually write ∈instead of E, or we
just write M instead of ⟨M, E⟩. Thus, V is a standard proper
class model of ZFC.

Models, consistency, and independence
By Gödel’s Completeness Theorem for ﬁrst-order logic, ZFC
has a model if and only if it is consistent. Hence, one cannot
prove in ZFC that there exists a model of ZFC. However, one
can prove the existence of models of arbitrarily large ﬁnite
fragments of ZFC.
A sentence ϕ is said to be independent of ZFC if neither ϕ not
its negation are provable in ZFC. Equivalently, if there exist two
models of ZFC, one satisfying ϕ and the other its negation.
The most famous example of independence of ZFC is Cantor’s
Continuum Hypothesis (CH) (Cantor, 1874): every inﬁnite set of
real numbers is either countable or it has the same cardinality
as R.
CH is equivalent to |R| = ℵ1, and also equivalent to 2ℵ0 = ℵ1.

The CH was Hilbert’s ﬁrst problem in his famous list of 23
unsolved problems he presented at the second International
Congress of Mathematicians, held in Paris in 1900.
In spite of many attemps by Cantor himself and others to prove
CH, it was not until 60 years later, in 1938, that Gödel
constructed his model L, the constructible universe, and proved
that CH holds in it, thereby showing that one cannot refute CH
in ZFC.
Further, in 1963, Paul Cohen invented a new revolutionary and
extremely powerful method for expanding models of ZFC,
called forcing, and used it to obtain models of ZFC in which CH
fails, thereby showing that one cannot prove CH in ZFC.
The Generalized Continuum Hypothesis (GCH) states that
2ℵα = ℵα+1, for all α ∈Ω. The GCH is also independent of ZFC.

There is no inﬁnite descending E-chain

Equivalently, every non-empty subset of X has an

For every x ∈X, the collection of all y ∈X such that yEx is
a set. (This, of course, holds automatically if X is a set.)
If E is a well-founded relation on a set (or a proper class) X,
then the rank function
ρ(x) := sup{ρ(y) + 1 : yEx}
(1)
maps X onto an ordinal, or onto Ωif X is a proper class, and is
order-preserving. The function ρ is the unique function
satisfying the equation above. ρ(x) is called the rank of x.

Proof.
Call a subset x of X E-transitive if for every y ∈x, if zEy, then

Deﬁne F as follows:
F(x) = y if and only if there is a function f with domain an
E-transitive set containing x such that for every z in the domain
of f, f(z) = G(z, f ↾{t : tEz}) and f(x) = y.
By induction on α ≥1 one can check that F is deﬁned for all
x ∈Xα.
Uniqueness follows by considering another such F ′, looking at
the least α such that the set {x ∈Xα : F(x) ̸= F ′(x)} is
non-empty, and then taking an E-minimal element x in this set.
It follows that F(x) = F ′(x), yielding a contradiction.

Let π(x) = {π(z) : zEx}. Clearly, aEb implies π(a) ∈π(b). So
one only needs to check that π(a) exists for every a ∈M, and
that π is one-to-one. Then we can take N to be the range of π.
Existence is guaranteed by the Transﬁnite Recursion Theorem
applied to E.
We can see that π is one-to-one by induction on the E-rank ρ of
the elements of M. For this, one needs to use
Extensionality.

The ﬁlter of closed unbounded sets
A subset C of an inﬁnite ordinal α is unbounded if for every
β < α there is γ ∈C greater than β. And C is closed if the
supremum of every increasing sequence of elements of C
belongs to C, provided this supremum is < α. Thus, C is
closed if and only if for every limit ordinal β < α, if C ∩β is
unbounded in β, then β ∈C. We say that C is a club subset of
α if it is closed and unbounded.
If κ is an uncountable cardinal, then the set of limit ordinals
smaller than κ is club. And if λ is a limit cardinal, then the set of
cardinals smaller than λ is club.

The ﬁlter of closed unbounded sets
Proposition
If α is an inﬁnite ordinal of uncountable coﬁnality, then the set
Club(α) := {X ⊆α : C ⊆X, for some club C} is a ﬁlter, called
the club ﬁlter on α.
Proof.
This follows easily from the fact that the intersection of any two
club sets is club. For suppose C and D are club. Given β < α,
pick alternatively γ2n ∈C and γ2n+1 ∈D so that
β < γ0 < γ1 < . . . < γ2n < γ2n+1 < . . .
Then, sup{γ2n : n < ω} = sup{γ2n+1 : n < ω} ∈C ∩D, because
C and D are closed and α has uncountable coﬁnality. This
shows C ∩D is unbounded. That C ∩D is also closed follows
immediately from the fact that both C and D are closed.

Theorem
If κ is a regular uncountable cardinal, then Club(κ) is
κ-complete, i.e., the intersection of less than κ-many club sets
is club.
Of course, it is not the case that the intersection of κ-many club
sets is club. But the diagonal intersection is. Let κ be a regular
uncountable cardinal. Given a sequence ⟨Xα : α < κ⟩of
subsets of κ, the diagonal intersection ∆α<κXα is deﬁned as
the set {α < κ : α ∈T
β<α Xβ}.
Proposition
If κ is a regular uncountable cardinal and ⟨Cα : α < κ⟩is a
sequence of club subsets of κ, then ∆α<κCα is club.

Stationary sets
The dual of the club ﬁlter on a cardinal κ of uncountable
coﬁnality is the ideal NSκ of non-stationary sets.
A subset S of κ is called stationary if it intersects all club
subsets of κ. Thus, every club set is stationary. Moreover, if S
is stationary and C is club, then S ∩C is stationary.
By duality, it follows that if κ is regular and uncountable, then
NSκ is κ-complete, that is, the union of less than κ-many
non-stationary sets is non-stationary.

Proposition
If λ < cof(κ) is a regular cardinal, then the set
Eκ
λ := {α < κ : cof(α) = λ} is stationary.
Proof.
Let C be a club subset of κ. Since λ < cof(κ), the λ-th element
α of C is less than κ, and since λ is regular α has coﬁnality
λ.
Thus, for example, the set Eω2
ω is a stationary subset of ω2 that
is not closed. However, Eω1
ω is closed, for it is the set of all
countable limit ordinals. Notice that Eω2
ω and Eω2
ω1 are disjoint
not-closed stationary subsets of ω2.

(Exercise.) Similarly, Π1 formulas are downwards absolute for
transitive sets or classes, that is, if ϕ(x) is Π1, a ∈M, and
N |= ϕ(a), then M |= ϕ(a).
If in a formula ϕ(x0, . . . , xk), where x0, . . . , xk occur free, we ﬁx
the values a0, . . . , ak of the variables x0 . . . , xk, then we say that

For n = 0 this is clear, since we may take C0 to be the class of

Given α ∈Cn, let f(α) ∈Cn be the least cardinal such that for
every formula ∃xϕ(x, x1, ..., xk), where ϕ is Πn, and every
a1, ..., ak in Vα, if ∃xϕ(x, a1, ..., ak), then ϕ(b, a1, ..., ak) for
some b ∈Vf(α). For each n < ω, let f n(α) be the n-iterate of f at
α. Let F(α) be the limit of all f n(α), n < ω. Thus F(α) is a
cardinal (and it belongs to Cn). Then Cn+1 = {F(α) : α ∈Cn} is

Inaccessible cardinals
A cardinal κ is (strongly) inaccessible if it is uncountable,
regular, and a strong limit, i.e., for every cardinal λ < κ, 2λ < κ.
If κ is inaccessible, then |Vκ| = κ and κ = ℵκ.
We shall see next that κ is inaccessible if and only if it is regular
and Vκ is a model of ZFC. It follows, by Gödel’s Second
Incompleteness Theorem, that one cannot prove in ZFC that
inaccessible cardinals exist.

Elementary substructures
We will sometimes consider the language of set theory
enriched with additional relation, function, or constant symbols,
as well as the corresponding structures for these languages.
E.g., structures of the form ⟨M, ∈, A, a⟩, where A is a subset of
M and a ∈M.
Given any two structures M ⊆N in a given language, we write
M ≺n N if M is a Σn-elementary substructure of N, i.e., for
every Σn formula ϕ(x0, . . . , xk) and every a0, . . . , ak ∈M,
M |= ϕ(a0, . . . , ak) if and only if N |= ϕ(a0, . . . , ak).
M is an elementary substructure of N, written M ≺N, if
M ≺n N for all n. Thus, if M ≺N, then M and N satisfy the
same sentences.

The Löwenheim-Skolem Theorem I
The Löwenheim-Skolem Theorem for ﬁrst-order logic asserts
that for every inﬁnite cardinal κ, every structure M for a
countable language, and every X ⊆M of cardinality κ, there is
an elementary substructure N of M with X ⊆N and such that N
has cardinality κ. In particular, every structure M for a
countable language has a countable elementary substructure.
Such a structure N can be obtained by closing X under a family
of Skolem functions, one for each existential formula. The
resulting structure N is called called the Skolem Hull of X.

The Löwenheim-Skolem Theorem
More precisely, for each existential formula ∃xϕ(x, y1, . . . , yn),
one has a function f : Mn →M that assigns to each n-tuple
⟨a1, . . . , an⟩a witness to the sentence ∃xϕ(x, a1, . . . , an),
whenever the sentence holds in M, and some ﬁxed element of
M otherwise. Every well-ordering of M gives rise to a family of
deﬁnable Skolem functions, namely, f(a1, . . . , an) is deﬁned as
the least witness to ∃xϕ(x, a1, . . . , an) under the well-ordering.

An application of the Löwenheim-Skolem Theorem
Every set is contained in a smallest transitive set, called its
transitive closure. The transitive closure of a set A, denoted by
TC(A) consists of all elements of A, the elements of elements
of A, the elements of elements of elements of A, and so on.
Suppose M is a transitive model of some fragment T ⊆ZFC,
and suppose A ∈M is of inﬁnite cardinality λ. Then we can
take the Skolem Hull of A in M, call it N. Thus N |= T, A ⊆N,
and N has cardinality λ.
Since N satisﬁes Extensionality, because M does, being
transitive, we can take the Mostowski collapse ¯N of N. Thus
¯N |= T and ¯N has cardinality λ. Moreover, if TC({a}) ⊆A, then
the Mostowski collapse of a is a itself, and so a ∈¯N.

Some characterizations of inaccessible cardinals
Theorem
The following are equivalent for a regular cardinal κ:
1
κ is inaccessible.
2
Vκ |= ZFC.
3
Vκ ≺1 V.
Proof.
(1) implies (2): Let us check that Vκ satisﬁes Replacement. So,
suppose F is a class function in Vκ whose domain is an
element of Vκ. Thus, by Replacement in V, the range of F is a
subset of Vκ, and it has cardinality less than κ. So, since κ is
regular, it is contained in some Vα, α < κ. But then the range of
F belongs to Vα+1.

(2) implies (3): Let ∃xψ(x, a) be a Σ1 sentence, with parameter
a ∈Vκ, and suppose ∃xψ(x, a) holds. Notice that since
Vκ |= ZFC, |TC({a})| < κ. Let b be a witness to ∃xψ(x, a) and
let λ be a regular cardinal greater than κ such that b ∈Vλ. Let
N be an elementary substructure of Vλ with b ∈N,
TC({a}) ⊆N and has cardinality < κ. Let M be the Mostowski
collapse of N. Let c be the collapse of b. Since a collapses to
itself, M |= ψ(c, a).

Hence, since Σ1 sentences are upwards-absolute for transitive
models, Vκ |= ∃xψ(x, a).
(3) implies (1): We check that κ is strong limit. So, suppose λ is
a cardinal less than κ. Then, ∃α∃f(f : α →Vλ+1 is onto). But
this is a Σ1 sentence with Vλ+1 as a parameter and so it holds
in Vκ.

Theorem (Levy, 1960)
A cardinal κ is inaccessible if and only if for every A ⊆Vκ there
is a λ < κ (equivalently, a club set of λs) such that
⟨Vλ, ∈, A ∩Vλ⟩≺⟨Vκ, ∈, A⟩.

More on inaccessible cardinals II
Proof.
Suppose κ is inaccessible and let A ⊆Vκ. Build a chain of
elementary substructures of ⟨Vκ, ∈, A⟩, each structure in the
chain of size < κ, so that the union of the chain is of the form
⟨Vλ, ∈, A ∩Vλ⟩, some λ < κ.
For the other direction, suppose κ is singular. Let A be a
function whose domain is some µ < κ and whose range is
coﬁnal on κ. Let λ > µ be such that ⟨Vλ, ∈, A ∩Vλ⟩≺⟨Vκ, ∈, A⟩.
Then, the range of A is contained in λ, which is impossible.
That κ is a strong limit is shown by a similar argument.

Mahlo cardinals
If κ is inaccessible, then the set C of all strong limit cardinals
smaller than κ is club. So if κ is the least inaccessible cardinal,
then all cardinals in C must be singular, for otherwise there
would be an inaccessible cardinal below κ.
An inaccessible cardinal κ is called Mahlo (after Paul Mahlo,
German mathematician) if the set of inaccessible cardinals
smaller than κ is stationary. That is, κ is Mahlo if and only if it is
inaccessible and every club subset of κ contains an
inaccessible cardinal.
One cannot prove from ZFC plus the existence of an
inaccessible cardinal that a Mahlo cardinal exists. For suppose
κ < λ are the ﬁrst two inaccessible cardinals. Then Vλ is a
model of ZFC which satisﬁes “There exists an inaccessible
cardinal" plus “There is no Mahlo cardinal".

Pushing the reﬂection principles a bit further, we can ask: Why
should we restrict to ﬁrst-order logic?
In second-order logic we have two kinds of variables: ﬁrst-order
variables x, y, z, . . ., and second-order variables X, Y, Z . . .,
which may also be quantiﬁed. We also have predicates X(x).
Second-order variables are interpreted in a given structure
⟨M, . . .⟩as subsets of M, and the predicates X(x) are
interpreted as x ∈X.

Weakly-compact cardinals
Weakly-compact cardinals were studied by Paul Erdös and
Alfred Tarski in the context of the partition calculus. Namely, κ
is weakly-compact if κ is an uncountable cardinal and satisﬁes
κ →(κ)2, i.e., for every coloring of all pairs of elements of κ
with two colors, there is a subset X of κ of cardinality κ such
that every pair of elements of X has the same color. Thus,
weak-compactness generalizes Ramsey’s theorem to the
uncountable.

Lemma
If κ is weakly-compact, then κ is inaccessible.
Proof.
Suppose κ = S{Xα : α < λ}, where all the Xα are pairwise
disjoint, λ < κ and |Xα| < κ, all α < λ. Let f be the coloring
given by: f({β, γ}) = 1 iff β and γ belong to the same Xα. Then
f has no homogeneous set of size κ. This shows κ is
regular.

To see that κ is a strong limit, suppose, towards a contradiction,
that {gα : α < κ} is a collection of functions from a ﬁxed λ < κ
into 2. Let f be the coloring given by: f({α, β}) = 1 iff
gα <lex gβ iff α < β.
An f-homogeneous set produces an increasing or a decreasing
sequence under the lexicographic ordering. But it is a general
fact that there cannot be any such sequence of length λ+: for
suppose {hα : α < λ+} is an increasing sequence. Let γ ≤λ
be the least ordinal such that {hα ↾γ : α < λ+} has size λ+.
So, we may assume all the hα ↾γ are distinct. For each α, let
δα be the least ordinal where hα and hα+1 differ. Note that
δα < γ. So, we may assume all δα are the same, call it δ. But if
hα ↾δ = hβ ↾δ, then hβ <lex hα+1 and hα <lex hβ+1. Hence,
α = β. Thus, {hα ↾δ : α < λ+} has size λ+, contradicting the
minimality of γ.

same color. Notice that we cannot require that all elements of
[X]<ω have the same color, since we could color [κ]n all green
and [κ]m all red, for different n and m.

If κ(ω1) exists, then ω1 is an inaccessible cardinal in L[a], for

a set I of indiscernibles of order-type ωL
1.
Equivalently, by taking the canonical Skolem hull of I in Lλ and
then taking the transitive collapse, we may also require that I
generates Lλ, i.e., every element of Lλ is deﬁnable in Lλ from a
ﬁnite set of indiscernibles.
Then any order-preserving injection f : I →I induces an
elementary embedding j : Lλ →Lλ.

This hypothesis, weaker than the existence of κ(ω1), is known
as 0♯exists.
It follows from work of Silver and Kunen that the existence of 0♯
is actually equivalent to the existence of a non-trivial
elementary embedding j : L →L.
Furthermore, Silver showed that the existence of 0♯implies that
there is a club class of indiscernibles for L, which generate L,
and which contains all uncountable cardinals in V. Hence, all
such cardinals are totally indescribable in L.

α = rank(x). Since the elements of x have rank smaller than α,
x ⊆j(x). So there is y ∈j(x) \ x. But then α ≤rank(y), since
otherwise j(y) = y ∈j(x), and therefore by elementarity of j,
y ∈x, which is not the case. Thus,
α ≤rank(y) < rank(j(x)) = j(α).
The least ordinal α moved by j is called the critical point of j,
denoted by crit(j).

Proposition
If α = crit(j), then α is a regular cardinal in N.
Proof.
Let us show that α is a cardinal. Otherwise, there is β < α and
a bijection f : β →α. But then, by elementarity, j(f) : β →j(α)
is also a bijection, which is impossible because f(γ) = j(f)(γ)
for all γ < β. A similar argument shows α is regular.

The ultrapower construction
Given an ultraﬁlter U on some cardinal κ we can form the
ultrapower of V by U, denoted by Ult(V, U), as follows.
Let V κ be the proper class of all κ-sequences of sets. We
deﬁne an equivalence relation ≡U on V κ by:
f ≡U g if and only if {α < κ : f(α) = g(α)} ∈U.
Since the equivalence classes [f] are proper classes, we
redeﬁne
[f] := {g : g ≡U f and ∀h(h ≡U f →rank(g) ≤rank(h))}
which is a set.

If U is σ-complete, then Ult(V, U) is well-founded.
Proof.
First notice that for every [f] ∈Ult(V, U), the collection of all [g]
such that [g]EU[f] is a set, because for each such g there is
h ∈[g] with rank(h) ≤rank(f).
Now suppose, towards a contradiction, that there is an inﬁnite
descending chain [fn+1]EU[fn]. For each n, let Xn ∈U witness
[fn+1]EU[fn]. By σ-completeness, there is α ∈T
n<ω Xn. But
then, fn+1(α) ∈fn(α), for all n, thus giving an inﬁnite

Theorem (Keisler and Scott, 1961)
κ is measurable if and only if there exists an elementary
embedding j : V →M, with M transitive, such that κ = crit(j).
Proof.
Suppose ﬁrst that κ is measurable, and let U be a κ-complete
non-principal ultraﬁlter over κ. Let jU : V →Ult(V, U) be the
corresponding elementary embedding. The ultrapower
Ult(V, U) is well-founded, so there is a Mostowski collapse
class isomorphism π : Ult(V, U) →M, with M transitive. Then
the embedding j := π ◦jU : V →M is elementary, so we only
need to check that κ = crit(j).

Proof (Continued).
Let γ < κ and assume j(β) = β for all β < γ. If γ < j(γ), then
[f]EU[cγ], for some f such that π([f]) = γ. So the set
{α < κ : f(α) ∈γ} is in U, hence since U is κ-complete, f has
constant value some β < γ on a set in U. But then [f] = [cβ],
and so γ = π([f]) = π([cβ]) = j(β) = β, which is impossible.
This shows j is constant below κ.
Now let id be the identity function on κ. Clearly,
[cβ]EU[id]EU[cκ], for all β < κ. Thus, β = j(β) < π([id]) < j(κ),
for all β < κ. Hence, κ < j(κ).

A ﬁlter on a regular uncountable cardinal is called normal if it is

Let us observe that the ultraﬁlter U deﬁned at the end of the last

∆α<κXα is deﬁned as the set {α < κ : α ∈T

Theorem
If κ is measurable, then κ is weakly compact.
Proof.
Fix a partition f : [κ]2 →2. Let U be a κ-complete,
non-principal, normal ultraﬁlter on κ. For each α < κ, let
fα : [κ]1 →2 be given by: fα(β) = f({α, β}). Since U is an
ultraﬁlter, for each α < κ there is Xα ∈U that is
fα-homogeneous, with constant value iα.
Let X := ∆α<κXα. Since U is normal, X ∈U. If α, β ∈X and
α < β < κ, then β ∈Xα, and so f({α, β}) = iα. Let i ∈{0, 1}
and H ⊆X, H ∈U, be such that iα = i for all α ∈H. Then
f({α, β}) = i for all α, β ∈H.

Thus, κ is measurable iff it is 0-strong iff it is 1-strong. Since
every ultraﬁlter on κ belongs to Vκ+2, if κ is 2-strong, then κ is
measurable in M and, therefore, there is a measure-1 set of

For κ a γ-strong cardinal, witnessed by j : V →M, there are

2
j(κ) ≤γ
In case (2) we have Vj(κ) ⊆M, and we say that κ is
superstrong, a large-cardinal notion which has a much higher
consistency strength than a strong cardinal. So, whenever we
talk about γ-strong cardinals, we will always assume that (1) is

We have seen that if j : V →M comes from a κ-complete

and j : V →M is the embedding that witnesses it. Then j
cannot come from a κ-complete ultraﬁlter on κ, since any such
ultraﬁlter belongs to Vκ+2 ⊆M.
Thus, if κ is strong, then there are ever stronger embeddings
with critical point κ, but for γ ≥2, they cannot come from
κ-complete ultraﬁlters on κ.
However, they may come from suitable sequences of
ultraﬁlters, called extenders.

If κ is strong, then V ̸= L[A] for every set A.

Assume there exists a proper class of Woodin cardinals. Then
the theory of the reals is absolute under forcing extensions of
V. In fact, for every forcing extension V P of V, there exists an
elementary embedding
j : L(R)V →L(R)V P
that is the identity on the reals.
This implies (Solovay) that every set of reals in L(R), hence
every projective set of reals, is Lebesgue measurable, has the

X ∈U iff X ⊆κ and κ ∈j(X).
Since M2κ ⊆M, U ∈M. Hence, κ is measurable in M and,

κ is supercompact if it is γ-supercompact for all γ.

Every supercompact cardinal is Woodin, and below the ﬁrst
supercompact cardinal there are many Woodin cardinals.
The notion of γ-supercompactness has been deﬁned in terms
of elementary embeddings j : V →M. But we would like to ﬁnd,
as in the case of measurable cardinals, an equivalent
formulation in terms of the existence of some sets, e.g.,
ultraﬁlters, so that the corresponding elementary embeddings
would be deﬁnable from them. We know that for
γ-supercompact cardinals the embeddings cannot come (for
γ ≥κ+) from ultraﬁlters on κ.

Suppose U is a σ-complete ultraﬁlter over a set A and

for every ordinal γ, j′′γ ∈M iff Mγ ⊆M.
Recall that if κ is measurable and j : V →M has critical point κ,
then j′′κ = κ and Mκ ⊆M. Then we deﬁned the ultraﬁlter
associated to j as the collection of all X ⊆κ such that κ ∈j(X).
So, now suppose j : V →M witnesses the
γ-supercompactness of κ. Since Mγ ⊆M, it seems only natural
to deﬁne an ultraﬁlter associated to j, call it U, as:
X ∈U iff X ⊆Pκ(γ) and j′′γ ∈j(X).

Otherwise, let j1 = j and jm+1 = j ◦jm. If jm(κ) > γ for some m,
then deﬁne Uγ using jm instead of j. But such an m does exist,
for otherwise δ := supm(jm(κ)) ≤γ < λ, and then since j(δ) = δ
we would have j ↾Vδ+2 : Vδ+2 →Vδ+2 is elementary with

VP can be formulated in the ﬁrst-order language of set theory
as an axiom schema, i.e., as an inﬁnite set of axioms, one for
each formula with two free variables. Formally, for each such
formula ϕ(x, y) one has the axiom:
∀x[(∀y∀z(ϕ(x, y)∧ϕ(x, z) →y and z are structures of same type)∧
∀α ∈OR ∃y(rank(y) > α ∧ϕ(x, y)) →
∃y∃z(ϕ(x, y) ∧ϕ(x, z) ∧y ̸= z ∧∃e(e : y →z is elementary))].
The theory ZFC plus VP implies, for instance, that the class of
extendible cardinals is stationary, i.e., every deﬁnable club
proper class contains an extendible cardinal.

The Hκ
For an inﬁnite cardinal κ, Hκ is the set of all sets having
transitive closure of cardinality < κ. Thus, Hω = Vω. We always
have Hκ ⊆Vκ. But Hω1 ̸= Vω1, as e.g., P(ω) ∈Vω+2 \ Hω1. Note
that all Hκ are transitive.
Similarly as with the Vα, the Hκ also form a cumulative
hierarchy: if κ ≤λ, then Hκ ⊆Hλ, and if κ is a limit cardinal,
then Hκ = S
λ<κ Hλ. Finally, V = S
κ∈CARD Hκ.
There is a closed proper class of cardinals C such that
Vκ = Hκ, for every κ ∈C.
If κ is inaccessible, then Vκ = Hκ.

For every Γ proper class C of structures of the same type τ
such that both τ and the parameters of some Γ-deﬁnition of C, if
any, belong to Hκ, C reﬂects below κ, i.e., for every B ∈C, there

j : ⟨Vλ+2, ∈, α, λ⟩→⟨Vµ+2, ∈, β, µ⟩.
Since j must send α to β and λ to µ, j is not the identity. Hence

Let j : V →M be an elementary embedding with M transitive
and critical point κ, such that j(κ) > λ and M is closed under
λ-sequences. Thus, B and j ↾B : B →j(B) are in M, and also
Vλ ∈M. Hence Vλ ⪯1 M. Moreover, since j(τ) = τ, j(B) is a
tructure of type τ, and j ↾B is an elementary embedding.
Since Vλ ⪯2 V, Vλ |= ϕ(B, b). And since Σ2 formulas are
upwards absolute between Vλ and M, M |= ϕ(B, b).
Thus, in M it is true that there exists X ∈Mj(κ) such that
ϕ(X, b), namely B, and there exists an elementary embedding
e: X →j(B), namely j ↾B. Therefore, by elementarity, the
same holds in V; that is, there exists X ∈Vκ such that ϕ(X, b),
and there exists an elementary embedding e: X →B.

Vopˇenka’s Principle
Let us give next an even more natural characterization of
supercompactness in terms of reﬂection.
A cardinal κ reﬂects a class of structures C of the same type if
for every B ∈C there exists A ∈C ∩Hκ which is elementary
embeddable into B.
Theorem (Magidor)
If κ is the least cardinal that reﬂects the Π1 proper class C of
structures of the form ⟨Vλ, ∈⟩, then κ is supercompact.

Supercompactness as a reﬂection principle
Thus, from the last two theorems we obtain the following
characterization of the ﬁrst supercompact cardinal.
Corollary
The following are equivalent:
1
κ is the ﬁrst supercompact cardinal.
2
κ is the least ordinal that reﬂects the Π1 class of structures
of the form ⟨Vλ, ∈⟩, λ an ordinal.
Corollary
A cardinal κ reﬂects all Π1 classes of structures of the same
type iff either κ is supercompact or a limit of supercompacts.

Extendible cardinals
Theorem (BCMR, 2009; B, 2010)
If κ is an extendible cardinal, then every class C of structures of
the same type τ ∈Hκ which is Σ3 deﬁnable, with parameters in
Hκ, reﬂects below κ. Hence VP(κ, Σ3) holds.
Theorem
If VP(κ, Σ3) holds, then κ is extendible, or a limit of extendibles.
Corollary (BCMR, 2009; B, 2010)
The following are equivalent:
1
VP(κ, Σ3), for some κ.
2
There exists an extendible cardinal.

The strongest large cardinals
Recall:
Theorem (Kunen, 1971)
Reinhardt cardinals don’t exist, i.e., there is no non-trivial
elementary embedding j : V →V. Not even a non-trivial
elementary embedding j : Vλ+2 →Vλ+2, for any λ.
The following are some of the strongest large-cardinal axioms
not known to be inconsistent:
I1 For some λ, there exists a non-trivial elementary
embedding j : Vλ+1 →Vλ+1.
I0 For some λ, there exists an elementary embedding
j : L(Vλ+1) →L(Vλ+1) with crit(j) < λ.
