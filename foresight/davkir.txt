Preface
To paraphrase a comment in the introduction to a classic point–set topology
text, this book might have been titled “What every young topologist should
know.” It grew from lecture notes we wrote while teaching algebraic topol-
ogy at Indiana University during the 1994-1995 and 1996-1997 academic
years.
The amount of algebraic topology a student of topology must learn can
be intimidating. Moreover, by their second year of graduate studies students
must make the transition from understanding simple proofs line-by-line to
understanding the overall structure of proofs of diﬃcult theorems.
To help our students make this transition, the material in these notes
is presented in an increasingly sophisticated manner. Moreover, we found
success with the approach of having the students meet an extra session per
week during which they took turns presenting proofs of substantial theorems
and wrote lecture notes to accompany their explanations. The responsibility
of preparing and giving these lectures forced them to grapple with “the big
picture,” and also gave them the opportunity to learn how to give mathe-
matical lectures, preparing for their participation in research seminars. We
have collated a number of topics for the students to explore in these ses-
sions; they are listed as projects in the table of contents and are enumerated
below.
Our perspective in writing this book was to provide the topology grad-
uate students at Indiana University (who tend to write theses in geometric
topology) with the tools of algebraic topology they will need in their work,
to give them a suﬃcient background to be able to interact with and appre-
ciate the work of their homotopy theory cousins, and also to make sure that
they are exposed to the critical advances in mathematics which came about

Preface
with the development of topology in the years 1950-1980. The topics dis-
cussed in varying detail include homological algebra, diﬀerential topology,
algebraic K-theory, and homotopy theory. Familiarity with these topics is
important not just for a topology student, but any student of pure mathe-
matics, including the student moving towards research in geometry, algebra,
or analysis.
The prerequisites for a course based on this book include a working
knowledge of basic point–set topology, the deﬁnition of CW-complexes, fun-
damental group/covering space theory, and the construction of singular ho-
mology including the Eilenberg-Steenrod axioms. In Chapter 8, familiarity
with the basic results of diﬀerential topology is helpful. In addition, a com-
mand of basic algebra is required. The student should be familiar with the
notions of R-modules for a commutative ring R (in particular the deﬁni-
tion of tensor products of two R-modules) as well as the structure theorem
for modules over a principal ideal domain. Furthermore, in studying non-
simply connected spaces it is necessary to work with tensor products over
(in general non-commutative) group rings, so the student should know the
deﬁnition of a right or left module over such a ring, and their tensor prod-
ucts. Basic terminology from category theory is used (sometimes casually),
such as category, functor, and natural transformation. For example, if a
theorem asserts that some map is natural the student should express this
statement in the categorical language.
In a standard ﬁrst–year course in topology students might also learn
some basic homological algebra including the universal coeﬃcient theorem,
the cellular chain complex of a CW-complex, and perhaps the ring structure
on cohomology. We have included some of this material in Chapters 1, 2,
and 3 to make the book more self–contained and because we will often have
to refer to the results. Depending on the pace of a ﬁrst–year course, a course
based on this book could start with the material of Chapter 2 (Homological
Algebra), Chapter 3 (Products), or Chapter 4 (Fiber Bundles).
Chapter 6 (Fibrations, Coﬁbrations and Homotopy Groups) and Chap-
ter 9 (Spectral Sequences) form the core of the material; any second–year
course should cover this material. Geometric topologists must understand
how to work with non simply–connected spaces, and so Chapter 5 (Homol-
ogy with Local Coeﬃcients) is fundamental in this regard. The material
in Chapters 7 (Obstruction Theory and Eilenberg-MacLane Spaces) and 8
(Bordism, Spectra, and Generalized Homology) introduce the student to
the modern perspective in algebraic topology. In Chapter 10 (Further Ap-
plications of Spectral Sequences) many of the fruits of the hard labor that
precede this chapter are harvested. Chapter 11 (simple-homotopy theory)
introduces the ideas which lead to the subject of Algebraic K-theory and
to the s-cobordism theorem. This material has taken a prominent role in

research in topology, and although we only cover a few of the topics in this
area (K1, the Whitehead group, and Reidemeister torsion), it serves as a
good preparation for more advanced courses.
These notes are meant to be used in the classroom, freeing the student
from copying everything from the chalkboard and hopefully leaving more
time to think about the material. There are a number of exercises in the
text; these are usually routine and are meant to be worked out when the
student studies. In many cases, the exercises ﬁll in a detail of a proof or
provide a useful generalization of some result. It goes without saying that
this subject, like any subject in mathematics, cannot be learned without
thinking through some exercises. Working out these exercises as the course
progresses is one way to keep up with the material. The student should keep
in mind that, perhaps in contrast to some areas in mathematics, topology
is an example–driven subject, and so working through examples is the best
way to appreciate the value of a theorem.
We will omit giving a diagram of the “independence” of various chapters,
or suggestions on which topics could be skipped, on the grounds that any
teacher of topology will have their own opinion based on their experience and
the interests of the students. (In any case, every topic covered in this book is
related in some way on every other topic.) We have attempted (and possibly
even succeeded) to organize the material in such a way as to avoid the use of
technical facts from one chapter to another, and hence to minimize the need
to shuﬄe pages back and forth when reading the book; this is to maximize
its usefulness as a textbook, as well as to ensure that the student with a
command of the concepts presented can learn new material smoothly and the
teacher can present the material in a less technical manner. Moreover, we
have not taken the view of trying to present the most elementary approach
to any topic but rather we feel that the student is best served by learning
the high-tech approach, since this ultimately is faster and more useful in
research. For example, we do not shrink from using spectral sequences to
prove basic theorems in algebraic topology.
Some standard references on the material covered in this course include
the books [8], [13], [43], [36], [31], [7], and [16]. A large part the material
in these notes were distilled from these books. Moreover, one can ﬁnd some
of the material covered in much greater generality and detail in these tomes.
Our intention is not to try replace these wonderful books, but rather to oﬀer
a textbook to accompany a course in which this material is taught.

Preface
We recommend that students look at the article “Fifty years of Homo-
topy Theory” by G. Whitehead [44] for an introduction to algebraic topol-
ogy, and look back over this article every few weeks to see how much of
it they are learning. The books a student should read after ﬁnishing this
course (or in conjunction with this course) are Milnor and StasheﬀChar-
acteristic Classes [30] (every mathematician should read this book) and
Adams Algebraic Topology: A student’s guide [1].
The authors would like to thank Eva-Marie Elliot and Mary Jane Wilcox
for typing early versions of the manuscript. Special thanks are due to our
colleagues Ayelet Lindenstrauss and Allan Edmonds for their careful proof-
reading of our manuscripts; all remaining mistakes and typographical errors
are entirely the authors’s fault.
The second author would like to thank
John Klein for teaching him algebraic topology while they were in graduate
school. Special thanks to Marcia and Beth.

The following is a list of topics to be covered in the “extra” meetings and
lectured on by the students. They do not always match the material of the
corresponding chapter but are usually either related to the chapter material
or preliminary to the next chapter. Sometimes they form interesting sub-
jects which could reasonably be skipped. Some projects are quite involved
(e.g. “state and prove the Hurewicz theorem”) and the students and instruc-
tor should confer to decide how deeply to cover each topic. In some cases
(e.g. the Hopf degree theorem, the Hurewicz theorem, and the Freudenthal
suspension theorem) proofs are given in later chapters using more advanced
methods.

Chain Complexes,
Homology, and
Cohomology
1.1. Chain complexes associated to a space
Here are 3 examples of chain complexes associated to a space:
1. The singular chain complex (Sq(X), ∂) of a topological space X.
2. The cellular chain complex (Cq(X), ∂) of a CW-complex X.
3. The simplicial chain complex (∆q(K), ∂) of a simplicial complex K.
Their constructions are as follows.
1.1.1. Construction of the singular chain complex. The (geometric)
q-simplex ∆q is deﬁned by
∆q =

(t0, t1, . . . , tq) ∈Rq+1|Σti = 1, ti ≥0 for all i

.
The face maps are the functions

m : ∆q−1 →∆q
deﬁned by
(t0, t1, . . . , tq−1) →
(t0, . . . , tm−1,
0 , tm, . . . , tq−1)

A singular q-simplex in a space X is a continuous map σ : ∆q →X.

Let R be a commutative ring with unit. Denote by Sq(X; R) the free
R-module with basis the singular q-simplices {σ : ∆q →X} and deﬁne the
diﬀerential ∂: Sq(X; R) →Sq−1(X; R) to be the R-linear map deﬁned on a
singular simplex σ by
∂(σ) =
q

One calculates that ∂2 = 0.
Recall that S∗(−; R) is a covariant functor, that is, a continuous map f :
X →Y induces a homomorphism of free modules f∗: S∗(X; R) →S∗(Y ; R).
One deﬁnes f∗by
f∗(σ) = f ◦σ
on a singular simplex σ, and extends by linearity.
Deﬁnition 1.1. The complex (S∗(X; R), ∂) is the singular (simplicial) chain
complex of X with coeﬃcients in R. Its homology
ker ∂: Sq(X; R) →Sq−1(X; R)
Im ∂: Sq+1(X; R) →Sq(X; R)
is denoted by Hq(X; R) and is called the singular homology of X with co-
eﬃcients in R. When R = Z, we omit the reference to R. Homology is a
covariant functor from the category of spaces to the category of R-modules.
We next recall the deﬁnition of the relative singular chain complex of a
pair of spaces (X, A).
If A ⊂X, deﬁne
Sq(X, A; R) = Sq(X; R)
Sq(A; R) .

1.1. Chain complexes associated to a space

Thus Sq(X, A; R) is a free R-module; a basis element is represented by a
singular q-simplex in X whose image is not contained in A. One obtains a

Exercise 1. Show that ∂: Sq(X, A; R) →Sq−1(X, A; R) is well–deﬁned
and ∂2 = 0.
The complex (Sq(X, A; R), ∂) is called the singular chain complex for
the pair (X, A) with coeﬃcients in R.
Its homology is deﬁned by
Hq(X, A; R) = ker ∂: Sq(X, A) →Sq−1(X, A)
Im ∂: Sq+1(X, A) →Sq(X, A).
1.1.2. Deﬁnition of a CW-complex. CW-complexes form a nice collec-
tion of topological spaces which include most spaces of interest in geometric
and algebraic topology.
Deﬁnition 1.2. Let X be a topological space and let A ⊂X be a closed
subspace. We say X is obtained from A by adjoining n-cells {en
i }i∈I if:
1. For each index i ∈I, en
i is a subset of X, called an n-cell.
2. Letting ∂en
i denote the intersection of en
i with A, we require en
i −∂en
i
to be disjoint from en
j −∂en
j for i ̸= j.
3. A subset B ⊂X is closed if and only if its intersection with A and
with each en
i is closed.
4. X = A ∪i en
i .
5. For each i ∈I there exists a continuous surjective map
φi : (Dn, Sn−1) →(en
i , ∂en
i ),
called a characteristic map for the cell en
i , so that the restriction of
φi to the interior int(Dn) is a homeomorphism onto en
i −∂en
i .
6. A subset B ⊂en
i is closed if and only if φ−1
i (B) is closed in Dn and
B ∩∂en
i is closed in ∂en
i .
The characteristic maps themselves are not part of the deﬁnition; only
their existence is. The restriction of the characteristic map to Sn−1 is called
the attaching map for the n-cell. Notice that adjoining 0-cells to a space is
the same as taking a disjoint union with a discrete set.

1. Chain Complexes, Homology, and Cohomology
Deﬁnition 1.3. A relative CW-complex (X, A) is a topological space X, a
closed subspace A, and a sequence of closed subspaces Xn, n = −1, 0, 1, 2, · · ·
called the relative n-skeleton so that
1. X−1 = A, X0 is obtained form A by adjoining 0-cells, and Xn is
obtained from Xn−1 by adjoining (n −1)-cells.
2. X = ∪∞
i=−1Xi.
3. A subset B ⊂X is closed in X if and only if B ∪Xn is closed in Xn
for each n.
The largest n so that X = Xn, if it exists, is called the dimension of
(X, A). If such an n does not exist, we say (X, A) is inﬁnite–dimensional. If
A is itself a CW-complex we call (X, A) a CW-pair.
If A is empty X is called an (absolute) CW-complex and Xn is called the
(absolute) n-skeleton.
1.1.3. Deﬁnition of the cellular chain complex of a CW-complex.
If X is a CW-complex and Xn ⊂X is the the n-skeleton of X, denote by
Cq(X; R) the relative homology group
Cq(X; R) = Hq(Xq, Xq−1; R).
If (X, A) is a CW-pair, then you have seen an argument (using excision
for singular homology) which shows that Hq(X, A; R) = Hq(X/A, A/A; R).
Applying this to (Xq, Xq−1), it follows that Cq(X; R) is the free R-module
on the q-cells of X.
Exercise 2. What is the excision argument? How can one use characteristic
maps φ : Dq →Xq for cells to give basis elements?
The diﬀerential ∂: Cq(X; R) →Cq−1(X; R) can be deﬁned in two ways.
The ﬁrst is purely algebraic, the second is geometric and involves the notion
of the degree of a map f : Sn →Sn. If you don’t know what the degree
of such a map is, look it up. If you know the deﬁnition of degree, then
look up the diﬀerential-topological deﬁnition of degree for a smooth map
f : Sn →Sn.
First deﬁnition of ∂.
Take ∂to be the composite
Hq(Xq, Xq−1; R)
δ−→Hq−1(Xq−1; R)
i−→Hq−1(Xq−1, Xq−2; R)
where δ is the connecting homomorphism in the long exact sequence in
singular homology for the pair (Xq, Xq−1) and i is induced by the inclusion
(Xq−1, φ) →(Xq−1, Xq−2).

1.1. Chain complexes associated to a space
5
Second deﬁnition of ∂. The quotient Xq−1/Xq−2 is homeomorphic to a
one-point union of (q −1)-spheres, one for each (q −1)-cell of X, since the
boundary of each (q −1)-cell has been collapsed to a point, and a (q −1)-cell
with its boundary collapsed to a point is a (q −1)-sphere. For each q-cell eq
consider the the attaching map Sq−1 →Xq−1. The composite of this map
with the quotient map to Xq−1/Xq−2 deﬁnes a map from a (q −1)-sphere
to a one-point union of (q −1)-spheres. Taking the degree of this map in
the factor corresponding to a (q −1)-cell eq−1
i
gives an integer denoted by
[eq : eq−1
i
].
Now deﬁne the diﬀerential ∂: Cq(X; R) →Cq−1(X; R) on a q-cell eq by
∂(eq) =

[eq : eq−1
i
]eq−1
i
(the sum is over all (q −1)–cells eq−1
i
), and extend to all chains by linearity.
Exercise 3. Prove that the two deﬁnitions of the diﬀerential
∂: Cq(X; R) →Cq−1(X; R)
are the same. (Hint: Hn(Dn, Sn−1)
δ−→Hn−1(Sn−1) is an isomorphism.) Use
the ﬁrst deﬁnition to show that ∂2 = 0.
The cellular homology groups are the homology groups of the complex
(C∗(X; R), ∂):
Hq(X, R) = ker ∂: Cq(X) →Cq−1(X)
Im ∂: Cq+1(X) →Cq(X).
Deﬁnition 1.4. A cellular map f : X →Y is a continuous function between
CW-complexes so that f(Xq) ⊂Yq for all q.
A cellular map induces a chain map f∗: C∗(X; R) →C∗(Y ; R), since f
restricts to a map of pairs f : (Xq, Xq−1) →(Yq, Yq−1). Thus for every q,
cellular homology is a functor
{CW-complexes, cellular maps} →{abelian groups, homomorphisms}
The proof of the following theorem can be found in any standard ﬁrst-year
algebraic topology textbook.
Theorem 1.5. The cellular and singular homology of a CW-complex are
naturally isomorphic.
So for example, the circle S1 has a cell structure with one 0-cell and
one 1-cell.
The boundary map is trivial, so H1(S1) ∼= Z.
A generator
[S1] ∈H1(S1) is speciﬁed by taking the 1-cell which parameterizes the circle
in a counterclockwise fashion. We can use this to deﬁne the Hurewicz map
ρ : π1(X, x0) →H1(X; Z)

Here π1(X, x0) denotes the fundamental group of X based at x0 ∈X
π1(X, x0) =
Homotopy classes of maps
(S1, 1) →(X, x0)
	
Recall that the fundamental group of a space is a non-abelian group in
general. Hurewicz theorem for the fundamental group is the following.
Theorem 1.6. Suppose that X is path–connected. Then the Hurewicz map
ρ : π1(X, x0) →H1(X; Z) is a surjection with kernel the commutator sub-
group of π1(X, x0). Hence H1(X; Z) is isomorphic to the abelianization of
π1(X, x0).
1.1.4. Construction of the simplicial chain complex of a simplicial
complex.
Deﬁnition 1.7. An (abstract) simplicial complex K is a pair (V, S) where
V is a set and S is a collection of non-empty ﬁnite subsets of V satisfying:
1. If v ∈V then {v} ∈S.
2. If τ ⊂σ ∈S and τ is non-empty, then τ ∈S.
Elements of V are called vertices. Elements of S are called simplices. A
q-simplex is an element of S with q + 1 vertices. If σ ∈S is a q-simplex we
say dim (σ) = q.
Put a (total) ordering on the vertices V .
Deﬁne the simplicial q-chains ∆q(K; R) to be the free R-module with
basis the q-simplices of K. Denote a q-simplex by ⟨σ⟩= ⟨v0, v1, . . . , vq⟩
where the vertices are listed in increasing order.
Deﬁne the diﬀerential
∂: ∆q(K; R) →∆q−1(K; R) on a q-simplex by
∂(⟨v0, v1, . . . , vq⟩) =
q

m=0

The homology of this chain complex is denoted H∗(K; R). Notice that these
deﬁnitions are purely combinatorial; the notions of topological space and
continuity are not used. The connection with topology is given by the next
deﬁnition.

1.2. Tensor products, adjoint functors, and Hom
7
Deﬁnition 1.8. The geometric realization of a simplicial complex K is the
quotient space
|K| = ⨿σ∈S∆dim (σ)
∼
.
In other words, we take a geometric q–simplex for each abstract q–simplex
of K, and glue them together. The identiﬁcations are given as follows: if
σ = ⟨v0, v1, . . . , vq⟩∈S and if τ = ⟨v0, v1, . . . , 
vm, . . . , vq⟩is a face of σ,
then identify the geometric simplex ∆dim (τ) corresponding to τ with a face
of the geometric simplex ∆dim (σ) corresponding to σ using the m-th face
map fq
m. In other words, the equivalence relation is generated by x ∼fq
m(x)
for x ∈⟨v0, v1, . . . , 
vm, . . . , vq⟩. (Look at [26] for a deeper perspective on
this construction.)
If one chooses another ordering of the vertices, then one can, with some
fuss about orientation, deﬁne a canonical isomorphism between the simpli-
cial chain complex (or geometric realization) deﬁned using one ordering to
the simplicial chain complex (or geometric realization) deﬁned using the
other ordering.
A triangulation of a topological space X is a homeomorphism from the
geometric realization of a simplicial complex to X.
Exercise 4. Find a triangulation of RP 2 and compute its simplicial ho-
mology.
The homology H∗(K; R) of an abstract simplicial complex K is isomor-
phic to H∗(|K|; R), the singular homology of its geometric realization. This
can be seen by noting that |K| is naturally a CW-complex, the q-skeleton is
the union of a simplices of dimension ≤q, the q-cells (which are always open
by deﬁnition, remember?) are the interiors of the q-simplices. The cellular
chain complex of |K| is isomorphic to the simplicial chain complex of K.
Another construction of homology uses the cubical singular complex
(this is the point of view taken in Massey’s book [23]).
This gives yet
another chain complex associated to a topological space.
It is not hard,
using the acyclic models theorem, to show that the simplicial and cubical
singular homology functors are naturally isomorphic.
1.2. Tensor products, adjoint functors, and Hom
1.2.1. Tensor products. Let A and B be modules over a commutative
ring R.

8
1. Chain Complexes, Homology, and Cohomology
Deﬁnition 1.9. The tensor product of A and B is the R-module A ⊗R B
deﬁned as the quotient
F(A × B)
R(A × B)
where F(A × B) is the free R-module with basis A × B and R(A × B) the
submodule generated by
1. (a1 + a2, b) −(a1, b) −(a2, b)
2. (a, b1 + b2) −(a, b1) −(a, b1)
3. r(a, b) −(ra, b)
4. r(a, b) −(a, rb).
One denotes the image of a basis element (a, b) in A⊗R B by a⊗b. Note
that one has the relations
1. (a1 + a2) ⊗b = a1 ⊗b + a2 ⊗b,
2. a ⊗(b1 + b2) = a ⊗b1 + a ⊗b2,
3. (ra ⊗b) = r(a ⊗b) = (a ⊗rb).
Informally, A ⊗R B is the largest R-module generated by the set of
symbols {a ⊗b}a∈A,b∈B satisfying the above “product type relations”. Any
element of A ⊗B can be expressed as a ﬁnite sum n
i=1 ai ⊗bi, but it may
not be possible to take n = 1, nor is the representation as a sum unique.
Recall that a function φ : A×B →M is R-bilinear if M is an R-module
and
1. φ(a1 + a2, b) = φ(a1, b) + φ(a2, b)
2. φ(a, b1 + b2) = φ(a, b1) + φ(a, b2)
3. φ(ra, b) = rφ(a, b) = φ(a, rb).
For example, the map π : A × B →A ⊗R B, (a, b) →a ⊗b is R-bilinear.
The universal property of the tensor product is that this map is initial in
the category of bilinear maps with domain A × B.
Proposition 1.10. Given a R-bilinear map φ : A×B →M, there is unique
R-module map ¯φ : A ⊗R B →M so that ¯φ ◦π = φ.

Proof. If φ exists, then φ( ai ⊗bi) =  φ(ai ⊗bi) =  φ ◦π(ai ⊗bi) =
 φ(ai, bi). Thus uniqueness is clear. For existence, deﬁne ˆφ : F(A × B) →
M on basis elements by (a, b) →φ(a, b) and extend by R-linearity. The
bilinearity of φ implies ˆφ(R(A × B)) = 0, so ˆφ induces φ : A ⊗R B →M by
the universal property of quotients.
Proposition 1.10 is useful for deﬁning maps out of tensor products, and
the following exercise indicates that this is the deﬁning property of tensor
products.
Exercise 5. Suppose p : A × B →T is an R-bilinear map so that for any
R-bilinear map ψ : A×B →M, there is a unique R-module map ψ : T →M
so that ψ ◦p = ψ. Then T ∼= A ⊗R B.

For the rest of this section, we will omit the subscript R from the tensor

theorem.
Theorem 1.11.
1. A ⊗B ∼= B ⊗A
2. R ⊗B ∼= B
3. (A ⊗B) ⊗C ∼= A ⊗(B ⊗C)
4. (⊕αAα) ⊗B ∼= ⊕α(Aα ⊗B)
5. Given R-module maps f : A →C and g : B →D, there is an R-
module map f ⊗g : A ⊗B →C ⊗D so that a ⊗b →f(a) ⊗g(b).
6. The functor −⊗M is right exact. That is, given an R-module M,
and an exact sequence
A

the sequence

is exact.
Proof.

1. Chain Complexes, Homology, and Cohomology
1. There is a map A ⊗B →B ⊗A with a ⊗b →b ⊗a. More formally,
the map A × B →B ⊗A, (a, b) →a ⊗b is bilinear, for example, one
sees (a1 + a1, b) →b ⊗(a1 + a2) = b ⊗a1 + b ⊗a2. By the universal
property there is a map A ⊗B →B ⊗A with  ai ⊗bi → bi ⊗ai.
The inverse map is clear.
2. Deﬁne R ⊗B →B by r ⊗b →rb and B →R ⊗B by b →1 ⊗b.
3. (a ⊗b) ⊗c ↔a ⊗(b ⊗c).
4. (⊕aα) ⊗b ↔⊕(aα ⊗b).
5. A × B →C ⊗D, (a, b) →f(a) ⊗g(b) is R-bilinear.
6. We explicitly deﬁne an isomorphism
g ⊗Id :
B ⊗M
(f ⊗Id)(A ⊗M) →C ⊗M
Since (g ⊗Id) ◦(f ⊗Id) = (g ◦f) ⊗Id = 0, the map g ⊗Id descends
to the map g ⊗Id by the universal property of quotients. The inverse
map is given by deﬁning an R-bilinear map C ×M →
B⊗M
(f⊗Id)(A⊗M) by
(c, m) →[ˆc⊗m] where g(ˆc) = c. Note that the map is independent of
the choice of lift ˆc, indeed if ˆc′ is another lift, then ˆc−ˆc′ ∈ker g = Im f,
so [ˆc ⊗m] −[ˆc′ ⊗m] = 0.
Example 1.12. Let M be an abelian group. Applying properties 5 and 2
of Theorem 1.11 we see that if we tensor the short exact sequence
0 →Z
×n
−−→Z →Z/n →0
by M we obtain the exact sequence
M
×n
−−→M →Z/n ⊗Z M →0.
Notice that Z/n ⊗Z M ∼= M/nM and that the sequence is not short exact
if M has torsion whose order is not relatively prime to n. Thus −⊗M is
not left exact.
Example 1.13. If V and W are vector spaces over R with bases {ei} and
{fj} respectively, then V ⊗R W has basis {ei ⊗fj}, thus dim(V ⊗R W) =
(dimV )(dimW).
Exercise 6. Compute A ⊗Z B for any ﬁnitely generated groups A and B.
1.2.2. Adjoint functors. Note that a R-bilinear map β : A × B →C is
the same as an element of HomR(A, HomR(B, C)). The universal property
of the tensor product can be rephrased as follows.

1.2. Tensor products, adjoint functors, and Hom
11
Proposition 1.14 (Adjoint Property of Tensor Products). There is an iso-
morphism of R-modules
HomR(A ⊗R B, C) ∼= HomR(A, HomR(B, C)),
natural in A, B, C given by φ ↔(a →(b →φ(a ⊗b))).
This is more elegant than the universal property for three reasons: It is
a statement in terms of the category of R-modules, it gives a reason for the
duality between tensor product and Hom, and it leads us to the notion of
adjoint functor.
Deﬁnition 1.15. (Covariant) functors F : C →D and G : D →C form an
adjoint pair if there is a 1-1 correspondence MorD(Fc, d) ←→MorC(c, Gd),
for all c ∈Ob C and d ∈Ob D, natural in c and d. The functor F is said to
be the left adjoint of G and G is the right adjoint of F.
The adjoint property says that for any R-module B, the functors
−⊗R B : R-MOD →R-MOD
and
HomR(B, −) : R-MOD →R-MOD
form an adjoint pair. Here R-MOD is the category whose objects are R-
modules and whose morphisms are R-maps.
It turns out that right exactness of −⊗R B and the left exactness of
HomR(B, −) is a formal consequence of being an adjoint pair, but we won’t
pursue this. A random functor may not have a left (or right) adjoint, but if
it does, the adjoint is unique up to natural isomorphism.
Exercise 7. Let SETS be the category whose objects are sets and whose
morphisms are functions. The forgetful functor R-MOD →SETS takes a
module to its underlying set. Find an adjoint for the forgetful functor. Find
another adjoint pair of your own. “Adjoints are everywhere.”
1.2.3. Hom.
Exercise 8. For any ﬁnitely generated abelian groups A and B, compute
HomZ(A, B), the group of all homomorphisms from A to B.
For an R-module A, deﬁne A∗= HomR(A, R). The module A∗is often
called the dual of A.
For a R-module map f : A →B, the dual map
f∗: B∗→A∗is deﬁned by f∗(ϕ) = ϕ ◦f. Hence taking duals deﬁnes a
contravariant functor from the category of R-modules to itself.
More generally, for R-modules A and M, HomR(A, M) is the R-module
of homomorphisms from A to M. It is contravariant in its ﬁrst variable
and covariant in its second variable. For an R-map f : A →B, we have

12
1. Chain Complexes, Homology, and Cohomology
HomR(f, M) : HomR(B, M) →HomR(A, M), deﬁned by ϕ →ϕ◦f. Usually
we write f∗for HomR(f, M). The following computational facts may help
with Exercise 8.
1. HomR(R, M) ∼= M.
2. HomR(⊕α Aα, M) ∼= 
α HomR(Aα, M).
3. HomR(A, 
α Mα) ∼= 
α HomR(A, Mα).
The distinction between direct sum and direct product in the category
of modules only is relevant when the indexing set is inﬁnite.
1.3. Tensor and Hom functors on chain
complexes
We will turn our attention now to the algebraic study of (abstract) chain
complexes (C∗, ∂) of R-modules. We do not assume that the chain groups
are free R-modules, although they are for the three geometric examples of
Section 1.1.
The starting observation is that the singular (or cellular) homology func-
tor is a composite of two functors, the singular complex functor
S∗: { spaces, cts. maps } →{ chain complexes, chain maps }
and the homology functor
H∗:{chain complexes, chain maps}→{graded R-modules, homomorphisms}.
The strategy is to place interesting algebraic constructions between S∗
and H∗; i.e. to use functors
{Chain Complexes} →{Chain Complexes}
to construct new homology invariants of spaces. The two families of functors
we use are the following.
1.
Forming the tensor product of a chain complex and an R-
module M.
This is the functor
(C∗, ∂) →(C∗⊗M, ∂⊗Id)
with
(∂⊗Id)

ci ⊗mi

=

(∂ci) ⊗mi.
Since (∂⊗Id)2 = 0, (C∗⊗M, ∂⊗Id) is a chain complex. You should
show that this is a covariant functor , i.e. write down the formula for the
map C∗⊗M →C′
∗⊗M induced by a chain map C∗→C′
∗and check that
it is a chain map.

1.3. Tensor and Hom functors on chain complexes
13
Deﬁnition 1.16. Taking the homology of C∗⊗M yields the homology of
C∗with coeﬃcients in M:
H∗(C∗; M) = ker ∂: C∗⊗M →C∗⊗M
Im ∂: C∗⊗M →C∗⊗M .
Applying this to the singular complex of a space leads to the following
deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 1.17. The homology of S∗(X; R) ⊗M is called the singular
homology of X with coeﬃcients in the R-module M and is denoted by
H∗(X; M).
In the same way one can deﬁne H∗(X, A; M), the relative singular ho-
mology with coeﬃcients in M. A similar construction applies to the cellular
complex to give the cellular homology with coeﬃcients.
2. Taking the R-linear maps from C∗to an R-module M.
This is the functor
(C∗, ∂) →(HomR(C∗, M), δ)
where the diﬀerential δ is the dual to ∂; i.e. δ = HomR(∂, M) (sometimes
denoted by ∂∗). Explicitly δ : HomR(C∗, M) →HomR(C∗, M) is deﬁned by
(δf)(c) = f(∂c).
Then δ2 = 0 since (δ2f)(c) = (δf)(∂c) = f(∂2c) = 0.
There are two
important facts to notice about this chain complex:
1. The diﬀerential δ of this complex has degree +1, and not −1 as in
the three examples we encountered before. What this means is that
δ : HomR(Cq, M) →HomR(Cq+1, M).
2. The functor is contravariant, in contrast to the tensor product functor
we considered above. The point here is that for any R−module M
the functor Hom(−, M) is a contravariant functor.
A useful terminology is to call a chain complex with degree +1 diﬀeren-
tial a cochain complex.
This leads us to the deﬁnition of the cohomology of a chain complex
with coeﬃcients in M:
Deﬁnition 1.18.
H∗(C∗; M) = ker δ : Hom(C∗, M) →Hom(C∗, M)
Im δ : Hom(C∗, M) →Hom(C∗, M)
is the cohomology of (C∗, ∂) with coeﬃcients in M.

14
1. Chain Complexes, Homology, and Cohomology
1.4. Singular cohomology
Applying the construction of the previous section to a space X one obtains
the singular cochain complex of X with coeﬃcients in the R-module M
(HomR(Sq(X; R), M), δ).
This cochain complex is denoted by S∗(X; M).
(Note that we can take
M = R.) Similar constructions apply to the cellular chain complex and the
simplicial chain complex.
Exercise 9. For a useful way to think about singular cochains, show that
Sq(X; R) = HomZ(Sq(X; Z), R)
and also show that
Sq(X; R) =functions({singular simplexes}, R).
Deﬁnition 1.19. The singular cohomology of X with coeﬃcients in the R-
module M is
Hq(X; M) = ker δ : HomR(Sq(X, R), M) →HomR(Sq+1(X, R), M)
Im δ : HomR(Sq−1(X, R), M) →HomR(Sq(X, R), M).
Similarly one deﬁnes the cellular cohomology of a CW-complex and the
simplicial cohomology of a simplicial complex.
Exercise 10. What is H0(X; Z)? Show that H0(Q; Z) ̸∼= H0(Q; Z), where
we consider the rational numbers Q as subspace of the real numbers R.
The primary motivation for introducing cohomology comes from the fact
that H∗(X; R) admits a ring structure, while homology does not. This will
be discussed in Chapter 3.
Recall that for a chain complex (C∗, ∂), a cycle is an element of ker ∂and
a boundary is an element of Im ∂. The terminology for cochain complexes
is obtained by using the “co” preﬁx:
Deﬁnition 1.20. A cocycle is an element in the kernel of δ and a coboundary
is an element in the image of δ.
Exercise 11. Show that a cocycle applied to a boundary is zero and a
coboundary applied to a cycle is zero. Deduce that there is a bilinear pairing
(the Kronecker pairing)
Hn(C∗; R) × Hn(C∗; R) →R
given by the formula
⟨[ϕ], [α]⟩= ϕ(α).
Deduce by taking adjoints that the Kronecker pairing deﬁnes a map
Hn(C∗; R) →HomR(Hn(C∗; R), R).

1.4. Singular cohomology
15
The Kronecker pairing on the homology and cohomology of a space
should be thought of as an analogue (in fact it is a generalization) of inte-
grating a diﬀerential n-form along an n-dimensional submanifold. (See the
paragraph on the DeRham complex on page 16.)
We will study the Kronecker pairing in detail for R a P.I.D. in Section
2.6. It is important to note that cohomology is not the dual of homology in
general. The map Hn(C∗; R) →HomR(Hn(C∗; R), R) need not be injective
nor surjective. The following example illustrates this. A precise relationship
between the dual of homology and cohomology is provided by the universal
coeﬃcient theorem (Theorem 2.29) when R is a P.I.D..

In particular H2(RP 2; Z) ̸= HomZ(H2(RP 2; Z), Z). Hence the Kronecker
pairing is singular.
Exercise 12. We will show that if R is a ﬁeld then homology and cohomol-
ogy are dual. Verify this for RP 2 and R = Z/2.

1. Chain Complexes, Homology, and Cohomology
Recall that if f : X →Y is continuous, then f∗: Sq(X) →Sq(Y )
is deﬁned via f∗(Σriσi) = Σrif ◦σi.
Since f∗is a chain map its dual
f∗: Sq(Y ) →Sq(X) is a (co)chain map. Hence the singular cochain functor
is contravariant. This implies the following theorem.
Theorem 1.21. Singular cohomology is a contravariant functor
{ spaces, continuous maps } →{graded R-modules, homomorphisms }.
Remark for those readers who know about diﬀerential forms.
Suppose X is a smooth manifold. Let Ωq(X) be the vector space of diﬀer-
ential q-forms on a manifold. Let d : Ωq(X) →Ωq+1(X) be the exterior
derivative. Then (Ω∗(X), d) is an R-cochain complex, whose cohomology
is denoted by H∗
DR(Ω∗(X), d) and is called the DeRham cohomology of X.
This gives geometric analogues: q-form and q-cochain, d and δ, closed form
and cocycle, exact form and coboundary.
DeRham’s theorem states that the DeRham cohomology of a manifold
X is isomorphic to the singular cohomology H∗(X; R). More precisely, let
Ssmooth
q
(X; R) be the free R-module generated by smooth singular simplices
σ : ∆q →X. There is the chain map
Ssmooth
∗
(X; R) →S∗(X; R)
given by inclusion and the cochain map
Ω∗(X) →Ssmooth
∗
(X; R)∗
given by integrating a q-form along a q-chain. DeRham’s theorem follows
from the fact that both maps are chain homotopy equivalences, i.e. they
have inverses up to chain homotopy.
1.4.1. Relative cohomology. Recall that the relative singular chain com-
plex of a pair (X, A) is deﬁned by taking the chain groups Sq(X, A) =
Sq(X)/Sq(A). Similarly, let M be an R-module and deﬁne the relative sin-
gular cochain complex by
Sq(X, A; M) = HomR(Sq(X, A; R), M)
δ = HomR(∂, M), δ(ϕ) = ϕ ◦∂.

0 −→A −→B −→C −→0
show that
0 →Hom(C, M) →Hom(B, M) →Hom(A, M)
and

We recall what it means for homomorphisms to split.
Deﬁnition 1.23.
1. An injection 0 −→A
α
−→B is said to split if there is a map δ : B →A
so that δ ◦α = IdA. The map δ is called a splitting.
2. A surjection B

need not be a surjection (ﬁnd an example!) but if α is split by δ, then the
dual map is a split surjection with splitting map HomR(δ, M).

1. Chain Complexes, Homology, and Cohomology
Applying the zig-zag lemma (a short exact sequence of (co)-chain com-
plexes gives a long exact sequence in (co)-homology) immediately implies
the following corollary.
Corollary 1.26. To a pair (X, A) of spaces there corresponds a long exact
sequence in singular cohomology
0 →H0(X, A; M) →H0(X; M) →H0(A; M)
δ−→H1(X, A; M) →
· · · →Hq−1(A; M)
δ−→Hq(X, A; M) →Hq(X; M) →· · ·
Note that the connecting homomorphism δ has degree +1, in contrast to
the homology connecting homomorphism ∂in homology which has degree
−1.
Exercise 17. Prove the zig-zag lemma, which says that a short exact se-
quence of (co)chain complexes yields a long exact sequence in (co)homology,
to remind yourself how to carry out diagram chase arguments.
Exercise 18. Using the facts that S∗(X; R) and S∗(X, A; R) are free chain
complexes with bases consisting of singular simplices (see Exercise 16), show
that
1. Sq(X; M) = Sq(X; R) ⊗R M can be expressed as the set of all sums
ℓ
i=1 mi ⊗σi|mi ∈M, σi a q-simplex
	
with ∂(m ⊗σ) = m ⊗∂(σ).
What is the corresponding statement for Sq(X, A; M)?
2. Sq(X; M) = HomR(Sq(X; R), M) is in 1-1 correspondence with the
set of functions from the set of singular q-simplices to M. Under this
identiﬁcation, given a cochain
α : {Singular q-simplices} →M,
its diﬀerential δα : {Singular (q + 1)-simplices} →M corresponds to
the map
δα(σ) = Σ(−1)iα(σ ◦fq+1
i
)
and Sq(X, A; M) ⊂Sq(X; M) corresponds to those functions which
vanish on the q-simplices entirely contained in A.
Exercise 19. Deﬁne and identify the cellular cochain complex in two dif-
ferent ways, as the dual of the cellular chain complex and in terms of relative
cohomology of the skeleta. (This will be easier after you have learned the
universal coeﬃcient theorem.)

1.5. The Eilenberg-Steenrod axioms
An important conceptual advance took place in algebraic topology when
Eilenberg and Steenrod “axiomatized” homology and cohomology.
Deﬁnition 1.27. An (ordinary) homology theory is a covariant functor
H∗: { (space, subspace) pairs, continuous maps of pairs } →
{ graded R-modules, homomorphisms },
in other words a collection of covariant functors Hq for each non-negative
integer q which assign an R-module Hq(X, A) to a pair (X, A) of topological
spaces and a homomorphism f∗: Hq(X, A) →Hq(Y, B) to every continuous
function of pairs f : (X, A) →(Y, B). These are required to satisfy the
following axioms:
1. There exist natural connecting homomorphisms
∂: Hq(X, A) →Hq−1(A)
for each pair (X, A) and each integer q so that the sequence
· · · →Hq(A) →Hq(X) →Hq(X, A)
∂−→Hq−1(A) →· · ·
· · · →H1(X, A)
∂−→H0(A) →H0(X) →H0(X, A) →0
is exact.
(Long exact sequence of a pair)
2. If f, g : (X, A) →(Y, B) are homotopic maps, then the induced maps
on homology are equal, g∗= f∗: Hq(X, A) →Hq(Y, B).
(Homotopy invariance)
3. If U ⊂X, U ⊂Int A, then Hq(X −U, A −U) →Hq(X, A) is an
isomorphism for all q.
(Excision)
4. If “pt” denotes the one-point space, then Hq(pt) = 0 when q ̸= 0.
(Dimension Axiom)
Theorem 1.28 (Existence). For any R-module M, there is a homology the-
ory with H0(pt) = M.
Similar comments apply to cohomology.
Deﬁnition 1.29. An (ordinary) cohomology theory is a contravariant func-
tor
H∗: { (space, subspace) pairs, continuous maps of pairs } →
{ graded R-modules, homomorphisms }.

20
1. Chain Complexes, Homology, and Cohomology
In other words a collection of contravariant functors Hq, one for each non-
negative integer q, which assign an R-module Hq(X, A) to a pair (X, A)
of topological spaces and a homomorphism f∗: Hq(Y, B) →Hq(X, A) to
every continuous function of pairs f : (X, A) →(Y, B). These are required
to satisfy the following axioms:
1. There exist natural connecting homomorphisms
δ : Hq(A) →Hq+1(X, A)
for each pair (X, A) so that the sequence of Corollary 1.26 is exact.
(Long exact sequence of a pair)
2. If f, g : (X, A) →(Y, B) are homotopic maps, then g∗= f∗:
Hq(Y, B) →Hq(X, A).
(Homotopy invariance)
3. If U ⊂X, U ⊂Int A, then Hq(X, A) →Hq(X −U, A −U) is an
isomorphism.
(Excision)
4. If pt is a point, Hq(pt) = 0 when q ̸= 0.
(Dimension Axiom)
Theorem 1.30 (Existence). For any R-module M, there is a cohomology
theory with H0(pt) = M.
There are many diﬀerent approaches to constructing homology and co-
homology theories; the choice of method is often dictated by the kind of
problem one is attacking. For example, singular homology and cohomology
is deﬁned for all spaces. Its abstract deﬁnition simpliﬁes the proofs of many
theorems, but it is too large to be eﬀective for computations. DeRham co-
homology is deﬁned for smooth manifolds and has many nice properties,
including direct relationships to solutions of diﬀerential equations on mani-
folds. There exist some extensions of DeRham theory to more general spaces;
these tend to be technical. Cellular homology is often the most useful for
computing, but of course applies only to CW-complexes.
ˇCech cohomology theory is another theory that satisﬁes the axioms (at
least for the subcategory of pairs of compact spaces), but the ˇCech co-
homology of the topologist’s sine curve is not isomorphic to the singular
cohomology. Thus the axioms do not determine the cohomology of space.
However they do for ﬁnite CW-complexes. An informal way of saying this
is that the proof that cellular cohomology equals singular cohomology uses
only the axioms. A more precise version is the following theorem whose
proof we omit. We state it for cohomology but the dual result holds for
homology also.

1.6. Projects for Chapter 1

Theorem 1.31 (Uniqueness). Let H∗and ˆH∗be contravariant functors
from the category {pairs of ﬁnite CW-complexes, cellular maps} to {graded
R-modules, homomorphisms} satisfying the Eilenberg-Steenrod Axioms. Let
pt be a point.
1. If H0(pt) ∼= ˆH0(pt), then there is a natural isomorphism of functors
H∗→ˆH∗.
2. Any natural transformation H∗→ˆH∗inducing an isomorphism for
a point, is an isomorphism for all CW-complexes.
In fact the excision axiom can be replaced by the weaker axiom that for
all ﬁnite CW-pairs H∗(X/A, A/A) →H∗(X, A) is an isomorphism. This
shows that cellular cohomology and singular cohomology coincide for ﬁnite
CW-complexes.
In light of this theorem, one can do all computations of cohomology
groups of ﬁnite CW-complexes using the axioms, without resorting to the
deﬁnition of the singular or cellular cochain complex. This is not always
the best way to proceed, but usually in doing cohomology computations one
makes repeated use of the axioms and a few basic computations.
There are also many functors from spaces to R-modules for which the
dimension axiom of Eilenberg and Steenrod does not hold. These are called
generalized (co)homology theories. They will be introduced in Chapter 8.

2.1. Axioms for Tor and Ext; projective
resolutions
Deﬁnition 2.1. An exact functor R-MOD →R-MOD is a functor which
takes short exact sequences to short exact sequences.
More generally, a covariant functor F : R-MOD →R-MOD is called
right exact (resp. left exact) if F(A) →F(B) →F(C) →0 is exact (resp.
0 →F(A) →F(B) →F(C) is exact) whenever 0 →A →B →C →0
is a short exact sequence. Similarly a contravariant functor is called right
exact (resp.
left exact) if F(C) →F(B) →F(A) →0 is exact (resp.
0 →F(C) →F(B) →F(A) is exact) whenever 0 →A →B →C →0 is a
short exact sequence.
We have already seen that the functors −⊗R M, HomR(M, −), and
HomR(−, M) are not exact in general. For example taking R = Z, M = Z/2,
and the short exact sequence
0 →Z

However, we have seen in Theorem 1.11 that −⊗R M is right exact and
in Exercise 14 that HomR(M, −) and HomR(−, M) are left exact.
Exercise 20. If F is a free module, show that −⊗R F and HomR(F, −) are
exact functors. Show by example that HomR(−, F) need not be exact.
The idea of homological algebra is to ﬁnd natural functors which measure
the failure of a functor to preserve short exact sequences. (A ﬁrst stab at
this for −⊗R M might be to take the kernel of A⊗M →B ⊗M as the value
of this functor. Unfortunately, this does not behave nicely with respect to
morphisms.) To construct these functors the only things we will use are the
left/right exactness properties, the above exercise and the observation that
for any module M there is a surjective map from a free module to M.
Theorem 2.2 (Existence).
1. There exist functors
TorR
n : R-MOD × R-MOD →R-MOD
for all n = 0, 1, 2, . . .
(M1, M2) →TorR
n (M1, M2) covariant in M1 and M2 satisfying the
following axioms:
T1) TorR
0 (M1, M2) = M1 ⊗R M2.
T2) If 0 →A →B →C →0 is any short exact sequence of R-
modules, and M is any R-module, then there is a natural long

2.1. Axioms for Tor and Ext; projective resolutions
25
The functor TorR
n (−, M) is called the nth derived functor of the
functor −⊗R M.
2. There exist functors
Extn
R : R-MOD × R-MOD →R-MOD
for all n = 0, 1, 2, . . .
(M1, M2) →Extn
R(M1, M2) contravariant in M1 and covariant in M2
satisfying the following axioms:
E1) Ext0
R(M1, M2) = HomR(M1, M2).
E2) If 0 →A →B →C →0 is any short exact sequence of R-
modules, and M is any R-module, then there is a natural long
exact sequence
0 →HomR(C, M) →HomR(B, M) →HomR(A, M) →Ext1
R(C, M) →· · ·
· · · →Extq
R(B, M) →Extq
R(A, M) →Extq+1
R
(C, M) →· · ·
E3) Extn
R(F, M) = 0 if F is a free module and n > 0.
The functor Extn
R(−, M) is called the nth derived functor of the
functor HomR(−, M).
Before we embark on the proof of this theorem, we prove that these
axioms characterize the functors Tor and Ext.
Theorem 2.3 (Uniqueness). Any two functors satisfying T1), T2), and
T3) are naturally isomorphic. Any two functors satisfying E1), E2), and
E3) are naturally isomorphic.
Proof. We will show that values of TorR
n (M1, M2) are determined by the
axioms by induction on n. This is true for n = 0 by T1). Next note that
for any module M1, there is a surjection F
φ
−→M1 →0 where F is a free
module. For example, let S ⊂M1 be a set which generates M1 as an R-
module (e.g. S = M1), and let F = F(S) the free module with basis S.
There is an obvious surjection φ. Let K = ker φ. Apply T2) to the short
exact sequence
0 →K →F →M1 →0.
Then by T2) and T3), one has
TorR
1 (M1, M2) ∼= ker(K ⊗R M2 →F ⊗R M2)
and
TorR
n (M1, M2) ∼= TorR
n−1(K, M2)
for
n > 1.
The values of TorR
n−1 are known by induction. The proof for Ext is similar.

26
2. Homological Algebra
The technique of the above proof is called dimension shifting, and it can
be useful for computations. For example, if F is a free module and
0 →K →F ′ →M →0
is a short exact sequence with F ′ free, then
TorR
1 (M, F) ∼= ker(K ⊗F →F ′ ⊗F)
but this is zero by Exercise 20. Thus TorR
1 (−, F) is identically zero. But
TorR
n (M, F) ∼= TorR
n−1(K, F) for n > 1, so inductively we see TorR
n (−, F)
is zero for n > 0. To compute Ext1
Z(Z/2, Z), we apply E2) to the exact
sequence 0 →Z
×2
−→Z →Z/2 →0, to get the exact sequence
Hom(Z, Z)
Hom(Z, Z)

so Ext1

The following proposition gives some simple but useful computations.
This result should be memorized. (The subscript or superscript R is often
omitted when the the choice of the ring R is clear from context.)
Proposition 2.4. Let R be a commutative ring and a ∈R a non-zero-
divisor (i.e. ab = 0 implies b = 0). Let M be an R-module. Let M/a =
M/aM and aM = {m ∈M|am = 0}. Then
1. R/a ⊗M ∼= M/a,
2. Tor1(R/a, M) ∼= aM,
3. Hom(R/a, M) ∼= aM,
4. Ext1(R/a, M) ∼= M/a.
Proof. Since a is not a divisor of zero, there is a short exact sequence
0 →R ×a
−→R →R/A →0.
Apply the functors −⊗M and Hom(−, M) to the above short exact sequence.
By the axioms we have exact sequences
0 →Tor1(R/a, M) →R ⊗M →R ⊗M →R/a ⊗M →0
and
0 →Hom(R/a, M) →Hom(R, M) →Hom(R, M) →Ext1(R/a, M) →0.

which has kernel aM and cokernel M/a.
In particular if n is a non-zero integer and R = Z, the four functors
Tor1, ⊗, Hom, and Ext1 applied to the pair (Z/n, Z/n) are all isomorphic
to Z/n. If m and n are relatively prime integers, then applied to the pair
(Z/m, Z/n) they are all zero.
Proposition 2.5.
1. If R is a ﬁeld, then TorR
n (−, −) and Extn
R(−, −) are zero for n > 0.
2. If R is a P.I.D., then TorR
n (−, −) and Extn
R(−, −) are zero for n > 1.
Proof. 1. All modules over a ﬁeld are free so this follows from axioms T3)
and E3).
2. A submodule of a free module over a P.I.D. is free, so for any module M
there is a short exact sequence
0 →F1 →F0 →M →0
with F1 and F0 free. Then by T2), T3), E2), and E3), for n > 1, TorR
n (M, −)
and ExtR
n (M, −) sit in long exact sequences ﬂanked by zero, and hence must
vanish.
The functors TorZ
1 and Ext1
Z are typically abbreviated Tor and Ext.
Exercise 21. Using the axioms, compute Tor(A, B) and Ext(A, B) for all
ﬁnitely generated abelian groups.
A couple of natural questions must have occurred to you. What is the
behavior of these functors with respect to exact sequences in the second
variable? Is Torn(A, B) ∼= Torn(B, A)? This seems likely since A ⊗B ∼=
B ⊗A. (Since Hom(A, B) ̸∼= Hom(B, A) the corresponding question for Ext
could not have possibly occurred to you!) Your questions are answered by
the following theorem.
Theorem 2.6 (Existence′).

R(M, I) = 0 if I is an injective module (see Deﬁnition 2.12)
and n > 0.
We postpone the proof of Theorem 2.6 until the next section.
Corollary 2.7. The functors TorR
n (A, B) and TorR
n (B, A) are naturally iso-
morphic.
Proof. By Theorem 2.6, the functor (A, B) →TorR
n (B, A) satisﬁes the
axioms T1), T2), and T3) and thus by the uniqueness theorem, Theorem
2.3, it must be naturally isomorphic to (A, B) →TorR
n (A, B).
Tor and Ext are higher derived versions of ⊗R and Hom, so they have
analogous properties. For example we oﬀer without proof:
1. TorR
n (⊕αAα, B) ∼= ⊕αTorR
n (Aα, B),
2. Extn
R(⊕αAα, B) ∼= 
α Extn
R(Aα, B), and
3. Extn
R(A, 
α Bα) ∼= 
α Extn
R(A, Bα).
The proofs of Theorems 2.2 and 2.6 are carried out using projective mod-
ules and projective resolutions. The functors Extn
R can also be deﬁned using
injective resolutions. We will carry out the details in the projective case
over the next few sections, and sketch the approach to Ext using injective
resolutions.
Much of what we say can be done in the more general setting of abelian
categories, these are categories where the concept of exact sequence makes
sense (for example the category of sheaves or the category of representa-
tions of a Lie algebra) provided there are “enough projectives” or “enough
injectives” in the category.

Thus projective modules generalize free modules by isolating one of the
main properties of free modules. Furthermore the deﬁnition of a projective
module is purely in terms of arrows in R-MOD, and hence is more elegant
than the deﬁnition of a free module. On the other hand they are less familiar.
Exercise 22. Let P be a projective module.
1. Any short exact sequence 0 →A →B →P →0 is split.
2. If P is ﬁnitely generated there is a ﬁnitely generated Q so that P ⊕Q
is free.
Proposition 2.10.
1. Any module over a ﬁeld is projective.
2. Any projective module over a P.I.D. is free.

2.2. Projective and injective modules
31
Proof. All modules over a ﬁeld are free, hence projective.
A projective
module P is a submodule of the free module P ⊕Q, and for P.I.D.’s sub-
modules of free modules are free.
There are many examples of non-free projective modules over rings R.
Note that R must be complicated, i.e. not a ﬁeld nor a P.I.D. For example,
if R = Z/6, then P = Z/2 is a projective module. (To see this, use the
Chinese remainder theorem Z/6 = Z/2 × Z/3).
Here is a more interesting example, related to K-theory. Let R be the
ring of continuous functions on the circle, R = C0(S1, R). Let E →S1 be
the twisted real line bundle over S1 (so E = open M¨obius band) Then as
vector bundles E ̸∼= S1 × R, but E ⊕E ∼= S1 × R2. So, if M = C0(E)
(continuous sections of E), M is not free (why?), but M ⊕M ∼= C0(S1, R)⊕
C0(S1, R) = R ⊕R. Thus M is projective.
Exercise 23. Show that the following are examples of projectives which
are not free.
1. Let R be the ring of 2-by-2 matrices with real entries. Let P = R2
where the action of R on P is by multiplying a matrix by a vector.
(Hint: Think of P as 2-by-2 matrices with the second column all
zeroes.)
2. Let R = R × R (addition and multiplication are component-wise)
and P = R × {0}.
One of the quantities measured by the functor K0 of algebraic K-theory is
the diﬀerence between projective and free modules over a ring. See Chapter
11 for another aspect of algebraic K-theory, namely the geometric meaning
of the functor K1.
As far as Tor and Ext are concerned, observe that
TorR
n (A ⊕B, M) ∼= TorR
n (A, M) ⊕TorR
n (B, M).
This is because A ⊕B ﬁts into the split exact sequence
0 →A →A ⊕B →B →0,
functoriality, and Axiom T2) put TorR
n (A ⊕B, M) in a corresponding split
exact sequence. Applying this to P ⊕Q ∼= free, (and applying a similar
argument to Ext) one obtains the following result.
Corollary 2.11. For a projective module P, for n > 0, and for any module
M, both TorR
n (P, M) and Extn
R(P, M) vanish.
Thus for purposes of computing Tor and Ext (e.g. dimension shifting),
projective modules work just as well as free modules.

2. Homological Algebra
In the categorical framework which we ﬁnd ourselves, something inter-
esting usually happens if one reverses all arrows. Reversing the arrows in the
deﬁnition of projective modules leads to the deﬁnition of injective modules.
Deﬁnition 2.12. An R-module M is called injective if
M
A
B
0
p p p p p p p✒
✛
β
✻
α
✛
has a solution for all A, B, α, β (with β injective).
We will deﬁne Ext using projective modules instead of injective mod-
ules, so we omit most details about injective modules. See Rotman [33] or
MacLane [22] for more. We list here a few results.
Theorem 2.13. An abelian group A is injective if and only if is divisible,
(i.e. the equation nx = a has a solution x ∈A for each n ∈Z, a ∈A.)
Thus some examples of injective abelian groups are Q and Q/Z. (Note
that a quotient of a divisible group is divisible, hence injective.)
Theorem 2.14.
1. Given any R-module M, there exists a projective R-module P and an
epimorphism P →M →0.
2. Given any R-module M, there exists an injective R-module I and a
monomorphism 0 →M →I.
Proof. We have already proved 1, by taking P to be a free module on a set
of generators of M. The proof of 2 is more involved. One proves it ﬁrst for
an abelian group. Here is one way. Express M = (⊕Z)/K. This injects to
D = (⊕Q)/K which is divisible and hence injective.
Now suppose M is a R-module. Then, considered as an abelian group,
there is a injection ϕ : M →D where D is divisible. One can show the map
M →HomZ(R, D), m →(r →ϕ(rm)) is an injective R-module map, and
that HomZ(R, D) is an injective R-module when D is divisible.
2.3. Resolutions
We begin with the deﬁnition of projective and injective resolutions of an
R-module.
Deﬁnition 2.15.

2.3. Resolutions
33
1. A projective resolution of an R-module M is a sequence (possibly
inﬁnitely long)
· · · →Pn →Pn−1 →· · · →P0 →M →0
where
(a) the sequence is exact, and
(b) each Pi is a projective R-module.
2. An injective resolution of M is a sequence
0 →M →I0 →I1 →I2 →· · · →In →· · ·
where
(a) the sequence is exact, and
(b) each In is an injective R-module.
Deﬁnition 2.16. Given a projective resolution, deﬁne the deleted resolu-
tion to be
· · · →Pn →Pn−1 →· · · →P0 →0
We will use the notation P∗or PM. Note that Hq(PM) is zero for q ̸= 0
and is isomorphic to M for q = 0.
Theorem 2.17. Every R-module M has (many) projective and injective
resolutions.
Proof. Choose a surjection P0 →M with P0 projective. Assume by induc-
tion that you have an exact sequence
Pn
dn
−→Pn−1 →· · · →P0 →M →0.
Let Kn = ker dn. Using the previous theorem, choose a projective module
Pn+1 which surjects to Kn. Then splice
Pn+1 →Kn →0
to
0 →Kn →Pn →· · · →P0 →M
to get
Pn+1 →Pn →· · · →P0 →M.
The proof for injective resolutions is obtained by re-writing the proof for
projective resolutions but turning the arrows around.
To see that projective resolutions are not unique, notice that if
→Pn
dn
−→Pn−1 →· · · →P0 →M →0
is a projective resolution, and Q is projective, then
→Pn+1 →Pn ⊕Q dn⊕Id
−→Pn−1 ⊕Q →Pn−2 →· · · →P0 →M
is also a projective resolution.

34
2. Homological Algebra
If at any stage in the above construction the kernel Kn is projective,
then one may stop there since
· · · →0 →0 →Kn →Pn−1 →· · · →P0 →M →0
is a projective resolution. We omit typing the 0’s.
We also record the following lemma which we used in constructing res-
olutions.
Lemma 2.18 (Splicing lemma). If the sequences A →B
α
−→C →0 and
0 →C
β−→D →E are exact, then A →B
β◦α
−−→D →E is exact.
Exercise 24. Prove the splicing lemma.
Theorem 2.19.
1. If R is a ﬁeld, and M is any R-module, then
0 →M
Id
−→M →0
is a projective resolution. In other words, every module over a ﬁeld
has a length 0 projective resolution. (It stops at P0.)
2. Every module over a P.I.D. has a length 1 projective resolution
0 →P1 →P0 →M →0.
3. Every abelian group (R = Z) has a length 1 injective resolution
0 →M →I0 →I1 →0.
Proof. 1. is clear.
2. Every submodule of a free module over a P.I.D. is free. Thus if P0 is
a free module surjecting to M, and P1 is its kernel,
0 →P1 →P0 →M →0
is a projective (in fact free) resolution of M.
3. If 0 →M →D0 is an injection with D0 divisible, then D0/M is
divisible, since the quotient of any divisible group is divisible. Thus 0 →
M →D0 →D0/M →0 is an injective resolution.
Comment about Commutative Algebra. A Dedekind Domain is a com-
mutative domain (no zero divisors) in which every module has a projective
resolution of length 1. Equivalently submodules of projective modules are
projective. A P.I.D. is a Dedekind domain. From the point of view of cat-
egory theory, they are perhaps more natural than P.I.D.’s. If ζn = e2πi/n is
a primitive n-th root of unity, then Z[ζn] is a Dedekind domain. Projective
modules (in fact ideals) which are not free ﬁrst arise at n = 23. Non-free
ideals are what makes Fermat’s Last Theorem so hard to prove.

2.4. Deﬁnition of Tor and Ext - existence
35
A commutative Noetherian ring R has height equal to n (ht(R) = n) if
the longest chain of non-trivial prime ideals in R has length n:
0 ⊂P1 ⊂· · · ⊂Pn ⊂R.
The homological dimension of R, hdim(R), is the least upper bound on
the length of projective resolutions for all ﬁnitely generated modules over
R. The homological dimension of a ﬁeld is 0 and a Dedekind domain is 1.
If a ring has homological dimension n, then any module M has a projective
resolution with Pk = 0 for k > n. The numbers ht(R) and hdim(R) are
related. For a large class of rings (regular rings) they are equal.
2.4. Deﬁnition of Tor and Ext - existence
In this section we will complete the proof of Theorem 2.2.
Let M, N be R-modules. Let · · · →Pn →· · · d2
→P1
d1
→P0
ϵ→M →0 be
a projective resolution of M. Applying −⊗R N to a deleted resolution PM
one obtains the sequence PM ⊗R N
PM ⊗R N = {· · · →Pn ⊗N →· · ·
d2⊗Id
−→
P1 ⊗N
d1⊗Id
−→
P0 ⊗N →0}
Note that PM ⊗N is a chain complex (since (dn−1 ⊗Id) ◦(dn ⊗Id) =
dn−1 ◦dn ⊗Id = 0), and by right exactness of −⊗N, the 0-th homology
is M ⊗N. However, since −⊗N need not be an exact functor in general,
PM ⊗N might not be exact.
Similarly, by applying the functor HomR(−, N) to a deleted projective
resolution PM one obtains the cochain complex
Hom(PM, N)={0→HomR(P0, N)
α∗
1
→HomR(P1, N)
α∗
2
→HomR(P2, N)→· · · }.
Exercise 25. Show that HomR(PM, N) forms a cochain complex.
We will eventually deﬁne TorR
n (M, N) as Hn(PM ⊗R N) and we will
deﬁne Extn
R(M, N) as Hn(Hom(PM, N)). (We could have also deﬁned Tor
and Ext as H∗(M ⊗R PN) and H∗(Hom(M, IN)).) For now we record some
obvious facts.
What is not obvious is that this will lead to well-deﬁned
functors, i.e. independent of the choice of resolutions.
Theorem 2.20. Let M and N be R-modules and let PM be a deleted pro-
jective resolution of M.
1. For n = 0, 1, 2, . . . the assignment (M, N) →Hn(PM ⊗R N) is a
covariant functor in N and satisﬁes Axioms T1′), T2′), and T3′) of
Theorem 2.6. Furthermore, if M is free (or just projective), one can
choose the resolution so that axiom T3) of Theorem 2.2 is satisﬁed.

36
2. Homological Algebra
2. For n = 0, 1, 2, . . . the assignment (M, N) →Hn(HomR(PM, N)) is
a covariant functor in N and satisﬁes Axioms E1′), E2′), and E3′) of
Theorem 2.6. Furthermore, if M is free (or just projective), one can
choose the resolution so that axiom E3) of Theorem 2.2 is satisﬁed.
Exercise 26. Prove this theorem.
Exercise 27. An R-module F is called ﬂat if −⊗R F is exact.
A free
module is ﬂat and clearly a summand of a ﬂat module is ﬂat, so projectives
are ﬂat. There are modules which are ﬂat, but not projective; show that Q
is a ﬂat but not projective Z-module. In fact over a P.I.D. a module is ﬂat
if and only if it is torsion free.
Tor can be computed using a ﬂat resolution rather than a projective one.
Assume this and compute Tor(Q/Z, A) = H1(PQ/Z ⊗A) for any abelian
group A.
2.5. The fundamental lemma of homological
algebra
Taking inventory, we still need to show that our candidates for Tor and
Ext are well-deﬁned, functorial in the ﬁrst variable, and that short exact
sequences in the ﬁrst variable give long exact sequences in Tor and Ext. The
well-deﬁnition and functoriality will follow from the fundamental lemma of
homological algebra; the long exact sequences will follow from the horseshoe
lemma.
Deﬁnition 2.21. A projective chain complex
P∗= {· · · →P2 →P1 →P0}
is a chain complex where all the modules Pi are projective. An acyclic chain
complex
C∗= {· · · →C2 →C1 →C0}
is a chain complex where Hi(C∗) = 0 for all i > 0. (i.e. C∗is an exact
sequence.)
Theorem 2.22 (Fundamental lemma of homological algebra.). Let P∗be a
projective chain complex and C∗be an acyclic chain complex over a ring R.
Then given a homomorphism ϕ : H0(P∗) →H0(C∗), there is a chain map
f∗: P∗→C∗inducing ϕ on H0. Furthermore, any two such chain maps are
chain homotopic.
We derive a few corollaries before turning to the proof.
Corollary 2.23. Any two deleted projective resolutions of M are chain ho-
motopy equivalent.

2.5. The fundamental lemma of homological algebra
37
Proof. Let PM and P′
M be deleted projective resolutions of M. They are
both projective and acyclic and they have H0 = M. The existence part of the
fundamental lemma gives chain maps f∗: PM →P′
M and g∗: P′
M →PM
inducing the identity on H0. The uniqueness part of the fundamental lemma
given a chain homotopy equivalence between g∗◦f∗and Id since they are
both chain maps PM →PM inducing the identity map on H0. Likewise
f∗◦g∗is chain homotopy to Id.
Corollary 2.24. The assignments (M, N) →Hn(PM⊗RN) and (M, N) →
Hn(HomR(PM, N)) do not depend on the choice of projective resolution and
are functorial in M.
Proof. Corollary 2.23 gives chain homotopy equivalences PM →P′
M and
hence a chain homotopy equivalence PM ⊗R N →P′
M ⊗R N and similarly
for Hom.
This gives the independence of the resolution.
Given a map
M →M′, the fundamental lemma gives a map PM →P′
M, unique up to
chain homotopy. This gives functoriality.
Corollary 2.25. The assignments (M, N) →Hn(PM⊗RN) and (M, N) →
Hn(HomR(PM, N)) are functorial in both variables and satisfy the ′ axioms
of Theorem 2.6.
Proof of the fundamental lemma, Theorem 2.22. Let M = H0(P∗)
and M′ = H0(C∗).
Then since H0(P∗) = P0/Im (P1 →P0), there is a
surjection P0 →M and likewise a surjection C0 →M′. So we wish to solve
the following problem (i.e. ﬁll in the dotted arrows so that the diagram
commutes).

This completes the existence part of the fundamental lemma; we switch
now to uniqueness up to chain homotopy. Suppose f∗, g∗are two choices of
chain maps which induce ϕ on H0.

Therefore Im (fn −gn −sn−1∂n) ⊂ker dn = Im (dn+1 : Cn+1 →Cn). Thus
dn+1sn = fn −gn −sn−1∂n, proving the induction step.
This ﬁnishes the proof of the fundamental lemma.
To show that our functors satisfy the remaining long exact sequence
axioms we need the following lemma.
Lemma 2.26 (Horseshoe lemma). Let 0 →A →B →C →0 be a short ex-
act sequence of R-modules. Let PA and PC be deleted projective resolutions
of A and C. Then there exists a deleted projective resolution PB of B, ﬁtting
into a short exact sequence of chain complexes 0 →PA →PB →PC →0
which induces the original sequence on H0.

It is important to notice that the short exact sequence 0 →PA →PB →
PC →0 is not (necessarily) a split short exact sequence of chain complexes,
even though each chain module is projective.
(What might a projective
object in the category of chain complexes be?)
Corollary 2.27. Let 0 →A →B →C →0 be a short exact sequence of
R-modules and let 0 →PA →PB →PC →0 be a short exact sequence of
deleted projective resolutions provided by the horseshoe lemma. Let N be an
R-module. Then there are long exact sequences:

42
2. Homological Algebra
· · · →Hn+1(PC⊗RN) →Hn(PA⊗RN) →Hn(PB⊗RN) →Hn(PC⊗RN) →· · ·
and
· · · →Hn(HomR(PC, N)) →Hn(HomR(PB, N)) →Hn(HomR(PA, N))
→Hn+1(HomR(PC, N)) →Hn+1(HomR(PB, N)) →· · ·
Proof. Since we have a short exact sequence of deleted projective resolu-
tions, in degree n, the short exact sequence
0 →(PA)n →(PB)n →(PC)n →0
is split, hence
0 →(PA ⊗R N)n →(PB ⊗R N)n →(PC ⊗R N)n →0
is split and hence exact. Thus
0 →PA ⊗R N →PB ⊗R N →PC ⊗R N →0
is a short exact sequence of chain complexes; the zig-zag lemma gives the
long exact sequence in homology above. We leave the cohomology proof as
an exercise.
We can ﬁnally safely make the following deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 2.28.
1. TorR
n (M, N) = Hn(PM ⊗R N).
2. Extn
R(M, N) = Hn(HomR(PM, N)).
With these deﬁnitions, the existence theorem, Theorem 2.2 and the
primed version, Theorem 2.6 follow from Corollaries 2.25 and 2.27.
We have not proven that Extn
R(M, N) = Hn(HomR(M, IN)). This fol-
lows by using injective versions of the fundamental lemma and the horseshoe
lemma to show that the axioms are also satisﬁed here. For these facts, see
any book on homological algebra, or, better, prove it yourself. Once we
have deﬁned tensor products and Hom for chain complexes, one can show
TorR
n (M, N) = Hn(PM ⊗R PN) and Extn
R(M, N) = HomR(PM, IN)); this
is an intermediate way between resolving on the left and the right.
Earlier in this chapter you were asked in an exercise to compute Tor(A, B)
and Ext(A, B) for ﬁnitely generated abelian groups. Lest you learn all the
theory without any examples, we give a way of stating the result.
Let
torsion(A) denote the subgroup of A consisting of elements of ﬁnite order.
Then
Tor(A, B) ∼= torsion(A) ⊗Z torsion(B)

2.6. Universal coeﬃcient theorems
43
and
Ext(A, B) ∼= torsion(A) ⊗Z B.
Exercise 28. For any commutative ring R show that
Extq
R(A ⊕B, M) ∼= Extq
R(A, M) ⊕Extq
R(B, M)
and
TorR
q (A ⊕B, M) ∼= TorR
q (A, M) ⊕TorR
q (B, M).
Finally we quote from the famous exercise from Lang’s Algebra, Chapter
IV ([21]):
“Take any book on homological algebra, and prove all the theorems with-
out looking at the proofs given in that book.
Homological algebra was invented by Eilenberg-MacLane. General cate-
gory theory (i.e. the theory of arrow-theoretic results) is generally known as
abstract nonsense (the terminology is due to Steenrod).”
2.6. Universal coeﬃcient theorems
Let (C∗, ∂) be a chain complex over a ring R. Then there is an evaluation
map
HomR(Cq, M) × Cq →M
(f, z) →f(z).
You have already come across this pairing in Exercise 11 and have shown
that this pairing passes to the Kronecker pairing
⟨, ⟩: Hq(C∗; M) × Hq(C∗) →M
of cohomology with homology. This pairing is bilinear, and its adjoint is a
homomorphism
Hq(C∗, M) →Hom(Hq(C∗); M).
The example following Exercise 11 shows that this adjoint need not be an
isomorphism. To understand the kernel and cokernel of this map is a sub-
tle question. Universal coeﬃcient theorems among other things provide a
measure of how this adjoint fails to be an isomorphism in terms of the de-
rived functors Extq and Torq. The answer can be quite diﬃcult for general
commutative rings and arbitrary chain complexes.
We will answer the question completely when R is a P.I.D. and C∗is a
free chain complex. In this case Hq(C∗, M) →Hom(Hq(C∗); M) is surjective
with kernel Ext(Hq−1(C∗), M). This will cover the topological situation in
the most important cases of coeﬃcients in the integers or in a ﬁeld, since
the singular and cellular complexes of a space are free.

Theorem 2.29 (universal coeﬃcient theorem for cohomology). Let R be a
principal ideal domain. Suppose that M is a module over R, and (C∗, ∂) is
a free chain complex over R (i.e. each Cq is a free R-module).
Then the sequence
0 →ExtR(Hq−1(C∗), M) →Hq(C∗; M) →Hom(Hq(C∗), M) →0
is exact, and natural with respect to chain maps of free chain complexes.
Moreover, the sequence splits, but not naturally.
We will give a proof of this based on the concept of an exact triangle.

Similarly one deﬁnes an exact triangle of graded R-modules A∗, B∗, C∗

where Zq denotes the q-cycles and Bq denotes the q-boundaries. The homo-
morphism i has degree 0 and ∂has degree −1. This sequence is in fact a
short exact sequence of chain complexes where Z∗and B∗are given the zero
diﬀerential.
Since the sequence (2.1) is an exact sequence of free chain complexes,
applying the functor Hom(−, M) gives another short exact sequence of chain
complexes

There is also short exact sequence of graded R-modules

coming from the deﬁnition of homology, that is
Z∗= ker ∂: C∗→C∗,
B∗= Im ∂: C∗→C∗,
and
H∗= H∗(C∗) = Z∗/B∗.
Notice that in the sequence (2.3), B∗and Z∗are free, since R is a P.I.D.
and these are submodules of the free module C∗. Thus using the second
axiom E2) of Theorem 2.2 and using the fact that Ext(Z∗, M) = 0 we
obtain an exact sequence

2. Apply Exercise 29 to obtain a short exact sequence of graded R-

Verify that the map H∗(C∗; M) →Hom(H∗, M) is induced by evalu-
ating a cochain on a cycle.
3. By taking the grading into account, ﬁnish the proof of Theorem 2.29.
Corollary 2.31. If R is a ﬁeld, M is a vector space over R, and C∗is a
chain complex over R, then
Hq(C∗; M) ∼= Hom(Hq(C∗), M).
Moreover the Kronecker pairing is non-degenerate.
Applying the universal coeﬃcient theorem to the singular or cellular
complexes of a space or a pair of spaces one obtains the following.
Corollary 2.32. If (X, A) is a pair of spaces A ⊂X, R a P.I.D., M a
module over R, then for each q the sequence
0→ExtR(Hq−1(X, A; R), M) →Hq(X, A; M) →Hom(Hq(X, A; R),M)→0
is short exact, natural, and splits (though the splitting is not natural).
Exercise 31. Let f : RP 2 →S2 be the map pinching the 1-skeleton to a
point. Compute the induced map on Z and Z/2 cohomology to show the
splitting is not natural.
The most important special case of the universal coeﬃcient theorem for
cohomology is its use in the computation of Hq(X) (cohomology with in-
teger coeﬃcients). For an abelian group A, we have denoted the torsion
subgroup (i.e. the subgroup of ﬁnite order elements) by torsion(A). Let
free(A) = A/torsion(A). Then for space X whose homology is ﬁnitely gener-
ated in every dimension (e.g. a ﬁnite CW-complex), the universal coeﬃcient
theorem shows that
Hq(X) ∼= free(Hq(X)) ⊕torsion(Hq−1(X)).

2.6. Universal coeﬃcient theorems
47
Another formulation is is to deﬁne the dual of an abelian group A by
A∗= Hom(A, Z) and the torsion dual A ∼= Hom(A, Q/Z), then the uni-
versal coeﬃcient theorem says that
Hq(X) ∼= Hq(X)∗⊕(torsion(Hq−1(X))).
The right hand side is then a contravariant functor in X but the isomorphism
is still not natural.
There are other universal coeﬃcient theorems, for more complicated
rings, and other algebraic situations. Knowing these can speed up compu-
tations. A useful example is the following theorem. (See [36, pg. 246] for a
proof.)
Theorem 2.33. If R is a P.I.D., M is a ﬁnitely generated R-module, and
C∗is a free chain complex over R then there is a split short exact sequence
0 →Hq(C∗) ⊗M →Hq(C∗; M) →TorR
1 (Hq+1(C∗), M) →0.
Notice the extra hypothesis that M be ﬁnitely generated in this state-
ment.
There are also universal coeﬃcient theorems for homology, and we turn
to these now. The following universal coeﬃcient theorem measures the dif-
ference between ﬁrst tensoring a complex with a module M and then passing
to homology versus ﬁrst passing to homology and then tensoring with M.
Theorem 2.34 (universal coeﬃcient theorem for homology). Suppose that
R is a P.I.D., C∗a free chain complex over R, and M a module over R.
Then there is a natural short exact sequence.
0 →Hq(C∗) ⊗M →Hq(C∗⊗M) →TorR
1 (Hq−1(C∗), M) →0
which splits, but not naturally.
Sketch of Proof. The proof is similar to the proof given above of Theorem
2.29. As before, there is a short exact sequence of chain complexes
0 →Z∗→C∗→B∗→0
which remains exact when tensoring with M, since B∗is free.
Applying the zig-zag lemma to the tensored sequence one obtains the
exact triangle

The short exact sequence of graded R-modules
0 →B∗→Z∗→H∗(C∗) →0
gives, using axiom T2) of Theorem 2.2, an exact sequence
0 →Tor(H∗(C∗), M) →B∗⊗M →Z∗⊗M →H∗(C∗) ⊗M →0.
(2.6)
Assembling the triangle (2.5) and the sequence (2.6) as in Exercise 29
one obtains the short exact sequence
0 →H∗(C∗) ⊗M →H∗(C∗; M) →Tor(H∗(C∗), M) →0.
Taking the grading into account ﬁnishes the proof.
Corollary 2.35. If (X, A) is a pair of spaces A ⊂X, R a P.I.D., M a
module over R, then for each q the sequence
0 →Hq(X, A; R) ⊗M →Hq(X, A; M) →TorR
1 (Hq−1(X, A; R), M) →0
is short exact, natural, and splits, but not naturally.
There is another universal coeﬃcient theorem for homology (see [36, pg.
248] for the proof). It addresses the question of how a diﬀerent version of
the Kronecker pairing fails to pass to a perfect pairing on (co)homology.
In this case, the pairing
HomR(C∗, R) × (C∗⊗M) →M
is deﬁned by
(f, z ⊗m) →f(z) · m.
This pairing passes to a pairing on homology
Hq(C∗; R) × Hq(C∗⊗M) →M.
Taking the adjoint yields the homomorphism
α : Hq(C∗⊗M) →HomR(Hq(C∗), M).
The following theorem computes the kernel of this homomorphism if R
is a P.I.D. and C∗has ﬁnitely generated homology.
Theorem 2.36. Let R be a P.I.D., C∗a free chain complex over R such
that Hq(C∗) is ﬁnitely generated for each q, and let M be an R-module.
Then the sequence
0 →Ext1
R(Hq+1(C∗), M) →Hq(C∗; M) α→Hom(Hq(C∗), M) →0
is short exact, natural, and splits.

As an application of the universal coeﬃcient theorems we can identify
the diﬀerent versions of the Betti numbers of a space. Recall that the q-th
Betti number βq(X) of a space X is the rank of Hq(X; Z). Since Q and R
are ﬂat abelian groups (see Exercise 27) Tor(−, Q), Tor(−, R), Ext(−, Q),
and Ext(−, R) all vanish. This implies the following.
Corollary 2.37. The following numbers are all equal: The Betti number
βq(X), dimQHq(X; Q), dimRHq(X; R), dimQHq(X; Q), and dimRHq(X; R).
In particular if X is a compact smooth manifold, by the above corollary
and DeRham cohomology we see the q-th Betti number is the dimension of
the real vector space of closed q-forms modulo exact q-forms.
Example. Since Hq(RP 2; Z) = Z, Z/2, 0, . . . for q = 0, 1, 2, . . . , by the
universal coeﬃcient theorem Hq(RP 2; Z/2) = Z/2, Z/2, Z/2, 0, . . . for q =
0, 1, 2, 3, . . . and Hq(RP 2; Z) = Z, 0, Z/2, 0, . . . for q = 0, 1, 2, 3, . . . What
is the geometric meaning of the torsion? Let α be a cycle representing the
generator of H1(RP 2; Z), e.g. α is a “half-equator”. Then 2α = ∂β. The
generators of H1(RP 2; Z/2) and H2(RP 2; Z/2) are represented by α ⊗1
and β ⊗1 respectively. A representative of the generator of H2(RP 2; Z) is
represented by a cocycle ω where ω(β) = 1.

2.7.1. The acyclic models theorem and the Eilenberg-Zilber map.
First state the acyclic models theorem very carefully.
Theorem 2.38 (acyclic models theorem). Suppose that (A, M) is a cate-
gory with models. Let C the category of augmented chain complexes over R.
Let F, F ′ : A →C be functors so that F is free and F ′ acyclic. Then there
exists a natural transformation Φ : F →F ′ unique up to chain homotopy.
In particular, if both F and F ′ are free and acyclic, then F and F ′ are
chain equivalent and any natural transformation between them is a chain
equivalence.
In this theorem A is a category, for example the category TOP of spaces
or the category TOP2 consisting of pairs (X, Y ) where X and Y are spaces
(but Y need not be a subspace of X), and M is a ﬁxed collection of objects
of A. The functor F : A →C is called acyclic if F(M) is an acyclic chain
complex for each model M ∈M; it is called free if for every X ∈A, the chain
groups Fq(X) are free with basis contained in the set {Fq(u)Fq(M)|M ∈
M, u ∈Hom(M, X)}.

Chapter 3
Products
The theory of products in the homology and cohomology of a space comes
about by combining two basic constructions. The ﬁrst is purely algebraic;
one forms the tensor product of chain complexes and their dual cochain com-
plexes and studies their relationships. The second construction is topological
and applies to the singular complex of a space. It is a natural chain homo-
topy equivalence between the singular chain complex S∗(X × Y ) and the
tensor product of S∗X and S∗Y . This result is called the Eilenberg-Zilber
theorem and it is a consequence of the acyclic models theorem.
3.1. Tensor products of chain complexes and the
algebraic K¨unneth theorem
We begin with a discussion about tensor products and Hom of graded R-
modules.
Deﬁnition 3.1.
1. A graded R-module A∗can be thought of either a collection of R-
modules {Ak}k∈Z, or as a module A = 
k Ak with a direct sum
decomposition.
2. A homomorphism of graded R-modules is a element of 
k Hom(Ak, Bk).
3. The tensor product of graded R-modules A∗and B∗is the graded
R-module
(A∗⊗B∗)n =

p+q=n
(Ap ⊗Bq).

52
3. Products
4. Deﬁne Hom(A∗, B∗) to be the graded R-module, with
Hom(A∗, B∗)n =

k
Hom(Ak, Bk+n).
The functors −⊗B∗and Hom(B∗, −) are adjoint functors from the
category of graded R-modules to itself.
5. A graded ring is a graded abelian group R∗together with a (degree
zero) map
R∗⊗R∗→R∗
which is associative in the sense that (ab)c = a(bc) where we write ab
for the image of a ⊗b. Alternatively, a graded ring can be thought of
as a ring R with a direct sum decomposition R =  Rk, satisfying
Rk · Rl ⊂Rk+l.
6. A graded ring is commutative if
ab = (−1)|a||b|ba,
where a ∈R|a| and b ∈R|b|.
7. A graded module M∗over a graded ring R∗is a module over R satis-
fying Rk · Ml ⊂Mk+l.
We apply these constructions to chain complexes. Let (C∗, ∂) and (C′
∗, ∂′
∗)
be two chain complexes. We allow Cq and C′
q to be nonzero for any q ∈Z.
Deﬁnition 3.2. The tensor product chain complex, (C∗⊗C′
∗, d) is deﬁned
by taking the tensor product of the underlying graded modules, so
(C∗⊗C′
∗)n =
⊕
p+q=n Cp ⊗C′
q
and giving it the diﬀerential
d(z ⊗w) = ∂z ⊗w + (−1)pz ⊗∂′w,
if z ∈Cp.
(The diﬀerential d is sort of a “graded derivative;” it satisﬁes the product
rule by deﬁnition.)
One computes:
d2(z ⊗w)
=
d(∂z ⊗w + (−1)pz ⊗∂′w)
=
∂2z ⊗w + (−1)p−1∂z ⊗∂′w
+(−1)p∂z ⊗∂′w + (−1)2pz ⊗∂′2w
=
0.
Thus (C∗⊗C′
∗, d) is indeed a chain complex.
One geometric motivation for this construction is the following. If X and
Y are CW-complexes with cells {ei} and {fj} respectively, then X × Y is a

3.1. Tensor Products of chain complexes
53
CW-complex with cells {ei×fj}. The cellular chain complex C∗(X ×Y ) can
be identiﬁed with (i.e. is isomorphic to) the tensor product C∗(X) ⊗C∗(Y ).
The question we wish to understand is: To what extent and how does the
homology of C∗and C′
∗determine the homology of C∗⊗C′
∗? A connection
between the two is provided by the algebraic homology cross product.
Exercise 32. If C∗, D∗are chain complexes, there is a natural map
×alg : HpC∗⊗HqD∗→Hp+q(C∗⊗D∗).
called the algebraic homology cross product deﬁned by
[z] ⊗[w] →[z ⊗w].
Write [z] ×alg [w] (or just [z] × [w]) for [z ⊗w].
The following theorem measures the extent to which this map is an
isomorphism, at least if the ground ring R is a P.I.D..
Theorem 3.3 (K¨unneth exact sequence). Suppose C∗, D∗are chain com-
plexes over a P.I.D. R, and suppose Cq is a free R-module for each q. Then
there is a natural exact sequence
0 →⊕
p+q=nHp(C∗)⊗Hq(D∗)
×alg
−−−→Hn(C∗⊗D∗)→⊕
p+q=nTorR(Hp(C∗), Hq−1(D∗))→0
which splits (non-naturally).
Proof. The proof is similar to the proof of the universal coeﬃcient theorem
(Theorem 2.29), and so we only sketch the argument, leaving details, notably
issues about the grading, to the reader.
Setting Zq = ker ∂: Cq →Cq−1 and Bq = Im ∂: Cq+1 →Cq we obtain
the short exact sequence
0 →Z∗→C∗
∂−→B∗→0
(3.1)
which we view as a short exact sequence of free chain complexes by giving
Z∗and B∗the zero diﬀerential (the modules Zq and Bq are free since they
are submodules of the free module Cq and R is a P.I.D.).
Since Bq is free, tensoring the short exact sequence (3.1) with D∗yields
a new short exact sequence of chain complexes.
0 →Z∗⊗D∗→C∗⊗D∗→B∗⊗D∗→0.
(3.2)
Since the diﬀerential in the chain complex Z∗is zero, the diﬀerential
∂: Z∗⊗D∗→Z∗⊗D∗reduces to
z ⊗d →(−1)|z|z ⊗∂d
and so passing to homology one gets
H∗(Z∗⊗D∗) = Z∗⊗H∗(D∗).

54
3. Products
Similarly
H∗(B∗⊗D∗) = B∗⊗H∗(D∗).
Thus, the long exact sequence in homology obtained by applying the
zig-zag lemma to the complex (3.2) reduces to the exact triangle
B∗⊗H∗(D∗)
Z∗⊗H∗(D∗)

with H∗(D∗) yields an exact sequence
0→Tor(H∗(C∗),H∗(D∗))→B∗⊗H∗(D∗)→Z∗⊗H∗(D∗)→H∗(C∗)⊗H∗(D∗)→0.
(3.4)
Combining (3.3) and (3.4), applying Exercise 29, taking care with the
grading, and chasing down the deﬁnitions of the maps induced ﬁnishes the
proof.
3.2. The Eilenberg-Zilber maps
Recall the statement of the Eilenberg-Zilber theorem. Until further notice,
homology and cohomology with coeﬃcients in a ring R is understood, and
we omit writing “ ; R ”.
Theorem 3.4 (Eilenberg-Zilber theorem). Let TOP2 be the category whose
objects are pairs of spaces (X, Y ) (we do not assume Y ⊂X), and mor-
phisms are pairs (f : X′ →X, g : Y ′ →Y ) of continuous maps. Then the
two functors
F : (X, Y ) →S∗(X × Y )
and
F ′ : (X, Y ) →S∗(X) ⊗S∗(Y )
from TOP2 to the category of chain complexes are naturally equivalent, i.e.
there exist natural transformations A : F →F ′ and B : F ′ →F so that for
any pair (X, Y ) the composites
S∗(X × Y )
A
−→S∗(X) ⊗S∗(Y )
B
−→S∗(X × Y )

3.2. The Eilenberg-Zilber maps
55
and
S∗(X) ⊗S∗(Y )
B
−→S∗(X × Y )
A
−→S∗(X) ⊗S∗(Y )
are chain homotopic to the identity. Moreover, any two choices of A (resp.
B) are naturally chain homotopic.
In particular, there exist natural isomorphisms
Hn(X × Y ) →Hn(S∗(X) ⊗S∗(Y ))
for each n.
The proof of this theorem is an easy application of the acyclic mod-
els theorem. See the project on the acyclic models theorem at the end of
Chapter 2.
The natural transformations A and B determine chain homotopy equiv-
alences
A : S∗(X × Y ) →S∗(X) ⊗S∗(Y )
and
B : S∗(X) ⊗S∗(Y ) →S∗(X × Y )
for any pair of spaces X and Y . We will call these maps the Eilenberg-Zilber
maps.
The confusing, abstract, but important point is that A and B are not
canonical, but only natural. That is, they are obtained by the method of
acyclic models, and so constructed step by step by making certain arbitrary
choices. However, these choices are made consistently for all spaces.
In what follows, we will show how a choice of A and B determines
natural additional structure, namely products, on the singular complex and
homology of a space. But you should keep in mind that all the constructions
depend at core on the non-canonical choice of the transformations A and B.
An alternative approach to this material is to just give speciﬁc formulas
for A and B. It is easy to imagine a chain map B : S∗(X) ⊗S∗(Y ) →
S∗(X × Y ). Given singular simplices σ : ∆p →X and τ : ∆q →Y , there
is the product map σ × τ : ∆p × ∆q →X × Y . Unfortunately the product
of simplices is not a simplex, but it can be chopped up into a union of
p+q-simplices (consider a square chopped into triangles or a prism chopped
into tetrahedra.) Then one could choose B(σ ⊗τ) to be a sum of singular
p + q-simplices – the “shuﬄe product”.
It is harder to imagine a candidate for the reverse map A : S∗(X ×
Y ) →S∗(X) ⊗S∗(Y ), but one can do this explicitly using projections to
X and Y – the “Alexander-Whitney diagonal approximation”. However,
even if one constructs the maps A and B explicitly, they will only be chain
homotopy equivalences, not isomorphisms; S∗(X × Y ) is simply bigger than
S∗(X) ⊗S∗(Y ).

56
3. Products
In any case, invoking a technical formula can obscure the point of a con-
struction (just look at any page of a diﬀerential geometry book for evidence
of this principle). Thus for what follows, ﬁx a natural transformations A
and B whose existence is asserted in Theorem 3.4. Each product on chain
complexes constructed below depends on the choice of A or B, but this
dependence disappears when passing to homology and cohomology.
3.3. Cross and cup products
3.3.1. The homology cross product and the K¨unneth formula. Ex-
ercise 32 implies that the natural map
×alg : HpX ⊗HqY →Hp+q(S∗X ⊗S∗Y )
given on the chain level by [a] ⊗[b] →[a ⊗b] is well-deﬁned. Denote by B∗
the isomorphism induced by the Eilenberg-Zilber map on homology, so
B∗: H∗(S∗(X) ⊗S∗(Y )) →H∗(S∗(X × Y )) = H∗(X × Y ).
Composing ×alg with B∗, we obtain
× : HpX ⊗HqY →Hp+q(X × Y ).
Deﬁnition 3.5. If α ∈HpX, β ∈HqY , the image of α ⊗β under this map
is called the homology cross product of α and β, and is denoted by α × β.
The Eilenberg-Zilber theorem has the following important consequence.
Theorem 3.6 (K¨unneth formula). If R is a P.I.D., there exists a split ex-
act sequence
0 →
n⊕
p=0 HpX ⊗Hn−pY →Hn(X × Y ) →
n−1
⊕
p=0 Tor(HpX, Hn−1−pY ) →0.
The ﬁrst map is given by cross products.
Proof. This follows easily by combining the the K¨unneth exact sequence
(Theorem 3.3) to the free chain complexes S∗X and S∗Y with the Eilenberg-
Zilber theorem.
Corollary 3.7. If R is a ﬁeld, then
H∗(X × Y ) = H∗(X) ⊗H∗(Y ).
Exercise 33. Compute H∗(RP 2×RP 2), both with Z and Z/2-coeﬃcients.
Give a geometric interpretation of the class coming from the Tor term in
the K¨unneth formula.
The K¨unneth formula implies that if R is a P.I.D., α × β ̸= 0 if α ̸= 0
and β ̸= 0.

3.3.2. The cohomology cross product. Let C∗and D∗be chain com-
plexes over a ring R and let C∗and D∗be the dual chain complexes
HomR(C∗, R) and HomR(D∗, R) respectively.
Exercise 34. If C∗, D∗are chain complexes, there is a natural map
×alg : HpC∗⊗HqD∗→Hp+q((C∗⊗D∗)∗)
deﬁned by [α] ⊗[β] →[ zi ⊗wi → α(zi) · β(wi)]. In this formula if α
and zi are of diﬀerent degrees, then α(zi) is zero, and likewise for β(wi).
The notation α(zi) · β(wi) refers to multiplication in the ring R.
This map is called the algebraic cohomology cross product.
Applying this product to the singular complexes we see that for any
spaces X and Y we have a map
×alg : HpX ⊗HqY →Hp+q((S∗X ⊗S∗Y )∗)
Using the Eilenberg-Zilber theorem we can further map to Hp+q(X × Y ).
Explicitly, the dual of the Eilenberg-Zilber map A : S∗(X×Y ) →S∗X⊗S∗Y
is a chain homotopy equivalence A∗: (S∗X ⊗S∗Y )∗→S∗(X × Y ). Passing
to cohomology one obtains an isomorphism
A∗: H∗((S∗X ⊗S∗Y )∗) →H∗(X × Y ).
This map is independent of the choice of Eilenberg-Zilber map A since any
two are naturally chain homotopic. (We will be somewhat casual with no-
tation and denote by A∗the dual of A as well as the induced map on co-
homology. This should not cause any confusion and will keep the notation
under control.)
Deﬁnition 3.8. If a ∈HpX, b ∈HqY , the image of a ⊗b under the
composite
HpX ⊗HqY
×alg
−−−→Hp+q((S∗X ⊗S∗Y )∗)
A∗
−→H∗(X × Y )
map is called the cohomology cross product of a and b, and is denoted by
a × b.
3.3.3. The cup product. Combining the the diagonal map ∆: X →
X × X, x →(x, x) with the cross product leads to the important cup
product:
Deﬁnition 3.9. If If a ∈HpX, b ∈HqX, then the cup product of a and b
is deﬁned by a ∪b = ∆∗(a × b) ∈Hp+qX.
To review, the cup product gives a homomorphism
HpX ⊗HqX →Hp+qX,
a ⊗b →a ∪b.

58
3. Products
It is deﬁned as the composite
HpX ⊗HqX
×alg
−−−→Hp+q((S∗X ⊗S∗X)∗)
A∗
−→Hp+q(X × X)
∆∗
−−→Hp+qX
where the ﬁrst map is given by ×alg, the second by the dual of the Eilenberg-
Zilber map A and the third by the diagonal map.
It is usually more intuitive to think of the cup product as a bilinear
pairing
∪: HpX × HqX →Hp+qX,
by precomposing with the canonical map HpX × HqX →HpX ⊗HqX.
The next lemma shows the cross product determines the cup product
and conversely the cup product determine the cross product.
Both are
functorial.
Lemma 3.10. Let f : X′ →X and g : Y ′ →Y be continuous maps. Let
a, b ∈H∗X and c ∈H∗Y .
1. a ∪b = ∆∗(a × b)
2. a × c = p∗
Xa ∪p∗
Y c, where pX and pY are the projections in X × Y .
3. f∗(a ∪b) = f∗a ∪f∗b.
4. (f × g)∗(a × c) = f∗a × g∗c
Proof. We prove these in reverse order. 4.) follows from the naturality of
the Eilenberg-Zilber map and the algebraic cohomology cross product with
respect to pairs of maps (f : X′ →X, g : Y ′ →Y ).
3.) follows since
f∗a ∪f∗b
=
∆∗(f∗a × f∗b)
=
∆∗(f × f)∗(a × b)
=
((f × f) ◦∆)∗(a × b)
=
(∆◦f)∗(a × b)
=
f∗(∆∗(a × b))
=
f∗(a ∪b).
2.) follows since

Id∗
X×Y (a × c).
1.) is the deﬁnition of cup product.

3.3. Cross and cup products
59
At this point it is convenient to introduce the concept of a diagonal
approximation.
Deﬁnition 3.11. A diagonal approximation τ is a chain map
τ : S∗X →S∗X ⊗S∗X
for every space X, so that
1. τ(σ) = σ ⊗σ for every 0-simplex σ.
2. τ is natural with respect to continuous maps of a spaces.
Now the functor S∗X is free on the models {∆n} and S∗X ⊗S∗X is
acyclic on these models, so the acyclic models theorem says that there exists
a diagonal approximation and any two such are natural chain homotopic.
If A is an Eilenberg-Zilber map and ∆: X →X × X is the diagonal map,
then τ = A ◦∆∗is a diagonal approximation. Thus we can rephrase the
deﬁnition of the cup product
a ∪b = τ ∗(a ×alg b).
Lemma 3.12. A choice of Eilenberg-Zilber map A : S∗(X × Y ) →S∗(X) ⊗
S∗(Y ) determines a diagonal approximation τ : S∗X →S∗X ⊗S∗X by the
formula
τ = A ◦∆∗.
Conversely, a diagonal approximation τ determines an Eilenberg-Zilber
map A by the formula A = (pX ⊗pY ) ◦τ, that is, as the composite
S∗(X × Y )
S∗(X × Y ) ⊗S∗(X × Y )
S∗(X) ⊗S∗(Y ).
✲
τ
✲
pX⊗pY
Proof. Given an Eilenberg-Zilber map A, clearly A ◦∆∗is a diagonal ap-
proximation.
Conversely, the map (pX ⊗pY ) ◦τ is a natural transformation from the
functor F : (X, Y ) →S∗(X×Y ) to the functor F ′ : (X, Y ) →S∗(X)⊗S∗(Y ).
By the uniqueness part of the Eilenberg-Zilber theorem, this must be an
Eilenberg-Zilber map.
In light of Lemma 3.12, we see that the cup product and the cohomology
cross product could just as well have been deﬁned starting with a diagonal
approximation. We will use τ or A depending on which one leads to simpler
notation, using the formulas of Lemma 3.12 to pass between the two.
The following theorem says that H∗X is a graded commutative ring with
unit. (Remember, coeﬃcients in a commutative ring R are understood.)
Part 3.) of Lemma 3.10 shows that a map of spaces f : X →Y induces a
map f∗: H∗Y →H∗X of graded rings.

60
3. Products
Theorem 3.13.
1. Let 1 ∈H0(X) be represented by the cocycle which takes every singu-
lar 0-simplex to 1 ∈R. Then 1 ∪a = a = a ∪1.
2. (a ∪b) ∪c = a ∪(b ∪c).
3. a ∪b = (−1)|a||b|b ∪a. Here |a| represents the degree of A, i.e. a ∈
H|a|X.
Proof. All three parts involve the uniqueness part of the method of acyclic
models.
1. Represent 1 ∈H0X by the cochain 1 ∈S0X. The algebraic co-
homology cross product is represented on the chain level by the canonical
identiﬁcation
×alg : C∗⊗D∗→(C∗⊗D∗)∗.
Consider the natural transformation of functors
C : S∗X →S∗X
deﬁned by
C(α) = τ ∗(1 ×alg α).
This induces the identity map on H0; if σ is a singular 0-simplex, then
C(α)(σ)
=
τ ∗(1 ×alg α)(σ)
=
(1 ×alg α)(τ(σ))
=
(1 ×alg α)(σ ⊗σ)
=
1(σ) · α(σ) = α(σ).
Since S∗X is free and acyclic on the models {∆p}, the map C must be
naturally chain equivalent to the identity by the acyclic models theorem.
Passing to cohomology gives 1.
2. The compositions of Eilenberg-Zilber maps
S∗X ⊗S∗Y ⊗S∗Z →S∗(X × Y ) ⊗S∗Z →S∗(X × Y × Z)
S∗X ⊗S∗Y ⊗S∗Z →S∗X ⊗S∗(Y × Z) →S∗(X × Y × Z)
are natural transformations of functors on TOP3 (triples of spaces), which
are free and acyclic on the models {∆p, ∆q, ∆r}. They induce the same map
on H0 so must be naturally chain homotopic. Associativity follows.
3. The key observation here is that for chain complexes C∗and D∗, the
interchange map
T : C∗⊗D∗→D∗⊗C∗
z ⊗w →(−1)|z||w|w ⊗z

3.3. Cross and cup products
61
gives an isomorphism of chain complexes. Let S : X × Y →Y × X be the
geometric switch map S(x, y) = (y, x). Thus the Eilenberg-Zilber maps
T ◦A : S∗(X × Y ) →S∗Y ⊗S∗X
A ◦S∗: S∗(X × Y ) →S∗Y ⊗S∗X
are naturally chain homotopic by the uniqueness part of the acyclic models
theorem. The result follows.
More explicitly, if S is the switch map on X × X, note that
S ◦∆= ∆: X →X × X.
Thus
a ∪b
=
∆∗(a × b)
=
∆∗S∗(a × b)
=
∆∗S∗A∗(a ×alg b)
=
∆∗(A ◦S)∗(a ×alg b)
=
∆∗(T ◦A)∗(a ×alg b)
=
(−1)|a||b|∆∗A∗(b ×alg a)
=
(−1)|a||b|b ∪a.
Exercise 35. Give another proof of the graded commutativity of the cup
product as follows. Let T : S∗X⊗S∗X →S∗X⊗S∗X be the algebraic switch
map, x ⊗y →(−1)|x||y|y ⊗x. Show that if τ is a diagonal approximation,
so is T ◦τ. Use this to show that H∗X is graded commutative.
Sometimes one wishes to use products on homology and cohomology
with coeﬃcients in various R-modules. The following exercise shows how to
accomplish this. The basic idea is that multiplication in the ring R was used
in the in the deﬁnition of cup products (in fact in the deﬁnition of ×alg),
and so when passing to more general modules an auxiliary multiplication is
needed.
Exercise 36. If M, N, P are R modules, and M × N →P a bilinear map,
show how to construct a cross product
× : Hp(X; M) × Hq(Y ; N) →Hp+q(X × Y ; P)
and a cup product
∪: Hp(X; M) × Hq(X; N) →Hp+q(X; P).

62
3. Products
3.3.4. The cap product. Recall that the Kronecker pairing is a natural
bilinear evaluation map (sometimes called “integration” by analogy with the
deRham map)
⟨, ⟩: S∗X × S∗X →R
deﬁned for a ∈SqX, z ∈SpX by
⟨a, z⟩=

a(z)
if p = q,
0
otherwise.
This pairing can be extended to a “partial evaluation” or “partial inte-
gration” map
E : S∗X ⊗S∗X ⊗S∗X →S∗X
by “evaluating the ﬁrst factor on the last factor”, i.e.
E(a ⊗z ⊗w) = a(w) ⊗z.
We will deﬁne the cap product on the chain level ﬁrst.
Deﬁnition 3.14. The cap product
Sq(X) × Sp+q(X) →Sq(X)
is deﬁned for a ∈Sq(X), z ∈Sp+q(X) by
a ∩z = E(a ⊗A ◦∆∗(z)).
The deﬁnition can be given in terms of a diagonal approximation τ
instead of the Eilenberg-Zilber map A:
a ∩z = E(a ⊗τ(z)).
Lemma 3.15. For α ∈SqX, z ∈Sp+qX,
∂(α ∩z) = (−1)pδα ∩z + α ∩∂z.
Proof. Suppose τ(z) =  xi ⊗yi so that |xi| + |yi| = p + q. Then since α
only evaluates non-trivially on chains in degree q, we have
∂(α ∩z)
=
∂E(α ⊗τ(z))
=
∂

|yi|=q
α(yi) · xi
=

|yi|=q
α(yi) · ∂xi

and
δα ∩z
=
E(δα ⊗τ(z))
=

δα(yi) · xi
=

|yi|=q+1
α(∂yi) · xi.
Moreover,
α ∩∂z
=
E(α ⊗τ(∂z))
=
E(α ⊗∂τ(z))
=
E(α ⊗(

∂xi ⊗yi +

|yi|=q
α(yi) · ∂xi +

|yi|=q+1
(−1)p−1α(∂yi) · xi
=
∂(α ∩z) + (−1)p−1(δα) ∩z.
Lemma 3.15 immediately implies:
Corollary 3.16. The cap product descends to a well deﬁned product
∩: HqX × Hp+qX →HpX
([α], [z]) →[α ∩z]
after passing to (co)homology.
Exercise 37. Let a, b ∈H∗X and z ∈H∗X. Show that
1. ⟨a, b ∩z⟩= ⟨a ∪b, z⟩.
2. a ∩(b ∩z) = (a ∪b) ∩z.
Thus the cap product makes the homology H∗(X) a module over the ring
H∗(X).
3.3.5. The slant product. We next introduce the slant product which
bears the same relation to the cross product as the cap product does to the
cup product (this could be on an SAT test). Again we give the deﬁnition
on the chain level ﬁrst.
Deﬁnition 3.17. The slant product
\ : Sq(Y ) × Sp+q(X × Y ) →Sp(X)
is deﬁned for a ∈SqY, and z ∈Sp+q(X × Y ) by
a\z = E(a ⊗A(z)) ∈SpX
Where A : S∗(X × Y ) →S∗(X) ⊗S∗(Y ) is the Eilenberg-Zilber map.

64
3. Products
Similar arguments to those given for the other products given above
show that
⟨a, b\z⟩= ⟨a × b, z⟩
for all a ∈SqY and that passing to (co)homology one obtains a well-deﬁned
bilinear map
\ : HqY × Hp+q(X × Y ) →HpX.
If M, N, P are R modules and M × N →P a bilinear map, one can
deﬁne cap products
∩: Hq(X; M) × Hp+q(X; N) →Hp(X; P)
and slant products
\ : Hq(Y ; M) × Hp+q(X × Y ; N) →Hp(X; P).
(See Exercise 36.)
There are even more products (the book by Dold [8] is a good reference).
For example, there is another slant product
/ : Hp+q(X × Y ) × HqY →HpX.
Often one distinguishes between internal products which are deﬁned in terms
of one space X (such as the cup and cap products) and external products
which involve the product of two spaces X × Y . Of course, one can go back
and forth between the two by thinking of X × Y as a single space and using
the two projections pX and pY and the diagonal map ∆: X →X × X.
3.4. The Alexander-Whitney diagonal
approximation
When considered on the chain level, the various products we have deﬁned
above do depend on the choice of Eilenberg-Zilber map A : S∗(X × Y ) →
S∗(X) ⊗S∗(Y ).
Only by passing to (co)homology does the choice of A
disappear. It is nevertheless often useful to work on the chain level, since
there is subtle homotopy-theoretic information contained in the singular
complex which leads to extra structure such as such as Steenrod operations
and Massey products.
We will give an explicit formula due to Alexander and Whitney for a
speciﬁc choice of A. This enables one to write down formulas for the products
on the chain level, and in particular gives the singular cochain complex of a
space an explicit natural associative ring structure.
Deﬁnition 3.18. Given a singular n-simplex σ : ∆n →X, and integers
0 ≤p, q ≤n, deﬁne the front p-face of σ to be the singular p-simplex
pσ : ∆p →X
pσ(t0, . . . , tp) = σ(t0, . . . , tp, 0, . . . , 0)

3.4. The Alexander-Whitney diagonal approximation
65
and the back q-face of σ to be the singular q-simplex σq : ∆q →X
σq(t0, . . . , tq) = σ(0, . . . , 0, t0, . . . , tq).
Let pX : X × Y →X and pY : X × Y →Y denote the two projections.
Deﬁnition 3.19. The Alexander-Whitney map
A : S∗(X × Y ) →S∗(X) ⊗S∗(Y )
is the natural transformation given by the formula
A(σ) =

p+q=n
p(pX ◦σ) ⊗(pY ◦σ)q.
Thus
A : Sn(X × Y ) →(S∗X ⊗S∗Y )n =
⊕
p+q=n SpX ⊗SqY.
The Alexander-Whitney map A is a natural chain map since it is given
by a speciﬁc formula involving geometric simplices which is independent of
the choice of X and Y .
Exercise 38. Show directly that A induces an isomorphism on H0.
From the uniqueness part of the Eilenberg-Zilber theorem, it follows that
A is a chain homotopy equivalence, and can be used to deﬁne cross products
and cup products. (This illustrates the power of the acyclic models theorem;
the naturality of the Alexander-Whitney map and the map on H0 suﬃce to
conclude that A is a chain homotopy equivalence.)
To an Eilenberg-Zilber map A one can associate the corresponding di-
agonal approximation τ = A ◦∆∗. Taking A to be the Alexander-Whitney
map one gets the following.
Deﬁnition 3.20. The Alexander-Whitney diagonal approximation is the
map
τ(σ) =

p+q=n
pσ ⊗σq.
This allows one to deﬁne a speciﬁc product structure on S∗X: for a
cochain α ∈SpX and β ∈SqX, deﬁne α ∪β ∈Sp+qX by
(α ∪β)(σ) = α(pσ) · β(σq).
Exercise 39. By tracing through this deﬁnition of the cup product, show
that [α] ∪[β] = [α ∪β].
Exercise 40. Using the Alexander-Whitney diagonal approximation,
1. prove that S∗(X; R) is an associative ring with unit 1 represented by
the cochain c ∈S0(X; R) = Hom(S0(X); R) which takes the value 1
on every singular 0-simplex in X.

66
3. Products
2. Compute cap products: show that if α ∈SqX and σ is a singular
(p + q)-simplex, then
α ∩σ = α(σq) · pσ.
3. Show that (α ∪β) ∩z = α ∩(β ∩z), and so the cap product makes
S∗(X) into a S∗(X) module.
We have already seen that cohomology is an associative and graded
commutative ring with unit in Theorem 3.13. However, the methods used
there cannot be used to show that S∗(X) is an associative ring; in fact it is
not for a random choice of Eilenberg-Zilber map A.
The Alexander-Whitney map is a particularly nice choice of Eilenberg-
Zilber map because it does give an associative ring structure on S∗(X).
This ring structure, alas, is not (graded) commutative (Steenrod squares
give obstructions to its being commutative), while the ring structure on
H∗X is commutative by Theorem 3.13.
Notice that the deRham cochain complex of diﬀerential forms on a
smooth manifold is graded commutative, since diﬀerential forms satisfy
a ∧b = ±b ∧a. It is possible to give a natural construction of a commuta-
tive chain complex over the rationals which gives the rational homology of
a space; this was done using rational diﬀerential forms on a simplicial com-
plex by Sullivan. This fact is exploited in the subject of rational homotopy
theory [14]. On the other hand it is impossible to construct a functor from
spaces to commutative, associative chain complexes over Z which gives the
integral homology of a space.
Exercise 41. Give an example of two singular 1-cochains α1 and α2 such
that α1 ∪α2 ̸= −α2 ∪α1 using the Alexander-Whitney diagonal approxima-
tion to deﬁne the cup product.
See Vick’s book [41] for a nice example of computing the cohomology
ring of the torus directly using the Alexander-Whitney diagonal approxima-
tion.
If X is a CW-complex then the diagonal ∆: X →X × X is not cellular
(consider X = [0, 1]). However the cellular approximation theorem says that
∆is homotopic to a cellular map ∆′. If ∆′
∗(z) =  xi ⊗yi, then the cup
product on cellular cohomology can be deﬁned by (α∪β)(z) =  α(xi)·β(yi).
The geometric root of the Alexander-Whitney diagonal approximation is
ﬁnding a simplicial map (i.e. takes simplices to simplices and is aﬃne on
the simplices) homotopic to the diagonal map ∆n →∆n × ∆n.
Let ϵ : S0X →R be the augmentation map ϵ( riσi) =  ri. This
passes to homology ϵ∗: H0X →R and is an isomorphism if X is path
connected.

3.5. Relative cup and cap products
67
The cup product of an q-dimensional cocycle with a q-dimensional co-
cycle generalizes the Kronecker pairing in the following sense.
Proposition 3.21. For α ∈HqX and z ∈HqX,
⟨α, z⟩= ϵ∗(α ∩z).
Proof. We show that for any cochain α ∈SqX and for any chain z ∈SqX,
using the Alexander-Whitney deﬁnition,
α(z) = ϵ(α ∩z).
By linearity it suﬃces to check this for z = σ.
ϵ(α ∩σ) = ϵ(α(σq) · 0σ)) = α(σ).
Notice that the argument shows that the equation ⟨α, z⟩= ϵ∗(α ∩z)
holds even on the chain level. Since ϵ∗is a canonical isomorphism for a
path–connected space we will usually just write
⟨α, z⟩= α ∩z.
Can you prove Proposition 3.21 for an arbitrary choice of diagonal ap-
proximation using the acyclic models theorem?
3.5. Relative cup and cap products
The constructions of cup and cap products carry over without any diﬃculty
to the singular chains and singular (co)homology of a pair (X, A). Naturality
then implies that there is a cup product
H∗(X, A) × H∗(X, B) →H∗(X, A ∩B).
(3.5)
However, it turns out that applying a construction that comes about in
proving the excision theorem via acyclic models, one can obtain a very useful
form of cup and cap products, for example there is a well-deﬁned natural
cup product
H∗(X, A) × H∗(X, B) →H∗(X, A ∪B),
(3.6)
provided A and B are open. (Explain to yourself why (3.6) is better than
(3.5).)
That the pairing (3.6) exists is not so surprising if you think in terms of
the Alexander-Whitney deﬁnition of cup product. Recall
(a ∪b)σ =

a(pσ) · b(σq).
If the image of σ is contained in either A or B, then the sum will be zero,
since a is zero on simplices in A and b is zero on simplices in B. However, if

68
3. Products
A and B are open, then one can subdivide σ so that each piece is contained
in A or B.
The existence of this cup product follows since subdivision
disappears when passing to cohomology. We now give a formal argument.
We begin with some algebraic observations. Suppose (X, A) and (Y, B)
are two pairs of spaces. Then
S∗X
S∗A ⊗S∗Y
S∗B
∼=
S∗X ⊗S∗Y
S∗X ⊗S∗B + S∗A ⊗S∗Y .
(3.7)
This is a natural isomorphism, induced by the surjection
S∗X ⊗S∗Y →S∗X
S∗A ⊗S∗Y
S∗B .
Exercise 42. Prove that (3.7) is a natural isomorphism.
Now assume X = Y , i.e. let A and B be subsets of X. The diagonal
approximation τ satisﬁes τ(S∗A) ⊂S∗A ⊗S∗A and τ(S∗B) ⊂S∗B ⊗S∗B.
Thus τ induces a map
τ :
S∗X
S∗A + S∗B →
S∗X ⊗S∗X
S∗X ⊗S∗A + S∗B ⊗S∗X .

Deﬁnition 3.22. If A, B are subspaces of a topological space X, we say
{A, B} is an excisive pair if the inclusion map
S∗(A) + S∗(B) ⊂S∗(A ∪B)
is a chain homotopy equivalence.
Since a chain map between free chain complexes inducing an isomor-
phism on homology is a chain homotopy equivalence, this is equivalent to
requiring that the inclusion map induces an isomorphism on homology.
If {A, B} is an excisive pair, the induced map on cochain complexes
S∗(A ∪B) →Hom(S∗(A) + S∗(B), R)
is also a chain homotopy equivalence and hence induces an isomorphism on
cohomology.
The excision theorem implies that if
A ∪B = Int A∪BA ∪Int A∪BB

3.5. Relative cup and cap products
69
then {A, B} is an excisive pair. Standard arguments show that if A, B are
subcomplexes of a CW-complex X, then {A, B} is excisive (replace A, B by
homotopy equivalent neighborhoods).

complement of A in this circle. Show that {A, B} is not an excisive pair.

∪: Hp(X, A) × Hq(X, B) →Hp+q(X, A ∪B).
Here is a particularly interesting application of Theorem 3.23.
Exercise 44. Show that if X is covered by open, contractible sets Ui, i =
1, · · · , n then
a1 ∪· · · ∪an = 0
for any collection of ai ∈Hqi(X) with qi > 0.
As an example, the torus cannot be covered by two charts, since the cup
product of the two 1-dimensional generators of cohomology is non-trivial
(by Exercise 48).
Notice that the pair {A, A} is always excisive. Thus H∗(X, A) is a ring.
Also, {A, φ} is always excisive. This implies the following.

3. Products
Corollary 3.24. There is a well-deﬁned natural cup product
∪: Hp(X, A) × HqX →Hp+q(X, A).
Similar arguments apply to cap products. The ﬁnal result is:
Theorem 3.25. If {A, B} is an excisive pair, then there is a well-deﬁned
cap product
∩: Hq(X, A) × Hp+q(X, A ∪B) →Hp(X, B).
Proof. (Special case when A = ∅, using the Alexander-Whitney map.)
If A = ∅, let a ∈SqX be a cocycle, and let c ∈Sp+qX so that its image
in Sp+q(X, B) is a cycle, i.e. ∂c ∈Sp+q−1B. Then a ∩c ∈SqX. Since
∂(a ∩c) = δa ∩c + (−1)qa ∩∂c, and δa = 0, it follows that ∂(a ∩c) = a ∩∂c.
Because ∂c ∈S∗B, a ∩∂c ∈S∗B also. Indeed, if ∂c =  riσi, σi :
∆p+q−1 →B, a ∩∂c =  ria(qσi) · σip−1, but σip−1 : ∆p−1 →B ∈S∗B.
Thus ∂(a ∩c) ∈S∗B, i.e. a ∩c is a cycle in S∗(X, B).
It is easy to check that replacing a by a + δx, and c by c + ∂y, y ∈
Sp+q+1(X, B) does not change a ∩c in Hp(X, B).
Exercise 45. Prove Theorem 3.25 when B = ∅and A ̸= ∅.

Let M be a connected manifold of dimension n.

if the non-orientable case seems too involved).
2. If M is compact, then Hn(M; Z) is Z or 0. It is Z if and only if M is
orientable.
From these facts you can deﬁne the Poincar´e duality maps. The following
theorem forms the cornerstone of the subject of geometric topology.

Theorem 3.26.
1. (Poincar´e duality) Let M be an oriented n-dimensional compact man-
ifold without boundary. Then the orientation determines a preferred
generator [M] ∈Hn(M; Z) ∼= Z. Taking cap products with this gen-
erator induces isomorphisms
∩[M] : Hp(M; Z) →Hn−p(M; Z).
2. (Poincar´e-Lefschetz duality) Let M be a compact oriented n-manifold
with non-empty boundary ∂M. Then the orientation determines a
preferred generator [M, ∂M] ∈Hn(M, ∂M; Z). The manifold with-
out boundary ∂M is orientable. Let [∂M] = ∂([M, ∂M]) where ∂:

and let A ⊂M be a ﬁnite subcomplex. Then Hp(A) is isomorphic to
Hn−p(M, M −A).

oriented n-dimensional manifold. For each p, deﬁne a bilinear form
Hp(M;Z) × Hn−p(M;Z) →Z
by a · b = ⟨a ∪b, [M]⟩.
Exercise 46. a · b = (−1)p(n−p)b · a.
Given a ﬁnitely generated abelian group A, let T = T(A) ⊂A denote
the torsion subgroup. Thus A/T is a free abelian group.

pairing

is an isomorphism of free abelian groups. (Hint: use the universal coeﬃcient
theorem and Poincar´e duality.)
The pairing (3.9) is called the intersection pairing on M. In Section
10.7 we will see that the pairing can be described by the intersection of
submanifolds of M.
Exercise 48. Compute the cohomology rings H∗(RP n; Z/2), H∗(CP n; Z),
and H∗(T n; Z) using Poincar´e duality and induction on n. (The ﬁrst two
are truncated polynomial rings; the last one is an exterior algebra.)
If dim M = 2k, then
Hk(M;Z)/T × Hk(M;Z)/T →Z
called the intersection form of M. It is well-deﬁned and unimodular over Z,
i.e. has determinant equal to ±1.
Let V = Hk(M,Z)/T. So (V ,· ) is an inner product space over Z. This
inner product space can have two kinds of symmetry.
Case 1. k is odd. Thus dim M = 4ℓ+2. Then v·w = −w·v for v, w ∈V ,
so (V ,· ) is a skew-symmetric and unimodular inner product space over Z.
Exercise 49. Prove that there exists a basis v1, w1, v2, w2, · · · , vr, wr so
that vi · vj = 0 for all i, j, wi · wj = 0 for all i, j, and vi · wj = δij. So
(V, · ) has matrix

(all other entries zero) in this basis. Such a basis is called a “symplectic
basis”. The closed surface of genus r is an example; describe a symplectic
basis geometrically.
Hence unimodular skew-symmetric pairings over Z are classiﬁed by their
rank. In other words, the integer intersection form of a 4k −2-dimensional
manifold M contains no more information than the dimension of H2k+1(M).
Case 2. k is even. Thus dim M = 4ℓ. Then v · w = w · v, so (V, · ) is a
symmetric and unimodular inner product space over Z
There are 3 invariants of such unimodular symmetric forms:
1. The rank of (V, · ) is the rank of V as a free abelian group.
2. The signature of (V, · ) is the diﬀerence of the number of positive
eigenvalues and the number of negative eigenvalues in any matrix

representation of (V, ·). (The eigenvalues of a symmetric real matrix
are all real.)
Notice that in any basis {vi} for V , the form · deﬁnes a matrix Q with
Qij = vi·vj. Since Q is symmetric, There exists a basis over the real numbers
so that in this basis Q is diagonal (with real eigenvalues).
Exercise 50. Show that although the eigenvalues of Q are not well deﬁned,
their signs are well-deﬁned, so that the signature is well-deﬁned. (This is
often called Sylvester’s Theorem of Inertia).
3. The type (odd or even) of (V, ·) is deﬁned to be even if and only if
v · v is even for all v ∈V . Otherwise the type is said to be odd.
The form (V, · ) is called deﬁnite if the absolute value of its signature
equals its rank; i.e. the eigenvalues of Q are either all positive or all negative.
The main result about unimodular integral forms is the following. For
a proof see e.g. [29].
Theorem 3.27. If (V, · ), (W, · ) are two unimodular, symmetric, indeﬁnite
forms over Z, then V and W are isometric (i.e. there exists an isomorphism
V →W preserving the inner product) if and only if they have the same rank,
signature, and type.
In fact, any odd indeﬁnite form is equivalent to ⊕

Deﬁnition 3.28. The signature, sign M, of a compact, oriented 4k-manifold
without boundary M is the signature of its intersection form
H2k(M; Z)/T × H2k(M; Z)/T →Z
The following sequence of exercises introduce the important technique
of bordism in geometric topology. The topic will be revisited from the per-
spective of algebraic topology in Chapter 8.
Exercise 52.
1. Let M be a closed, odd–dimensional manifold. Show that the Euler
characteristic χ(M) = 0. Prove it for non-orientable manifolds, too.
2. Let M be a closed, orientable manifold of dimension 4k + 2. Show
that χ(M) is even.
3. Let M be a closed, oriented manifold of dimension 4k. Show that the
signature sign M is congruent to χ(M) mod 2.
4. Let M be the boundary of a compact manifold W. Show χ(M) is
even.
5. Let M be the boundary of an compact, oriented manifold W and
suppose the dimension of M is 4k. Show sign M = 0.
6. Give examples of manifolds which are and are not boundaries.
We have seen that even–dimensional manifolds admit intersection forms
on the free part of their middle dimensional cohomology. For odd-dimensional
manifolds one can construct the linking form on the torsion part of the
“middle dimensional” cohomology as well. The construction is a bit more
involved. We will outline one approach. Underlying this construction is the
following exercise.
Exercise 53. If M is a compact, closed, oriented manifold of dimension n,
show that the torsion subgroups of Hp(M) and Hn−p+1(M) are isomorphic.
(Note: you will use the fact that H∗(M) is ﬁnitely generated if M is a
compact manifold.)
Consider the short exact sequence of abelian groups

For any space X, one can dualize this sequence with the (integer) singular
complex to obtain a short exact sequence of cochain complexes
0 →HomZ(S∗(X), Z) →HomZ(S∗(X), Q) →HomZ(S∗(X), Q/Z) →0.
The zig-zag lemma gives a long exact sequence in cohomology
· · · →Hq−1(X; Q/Z)

i−→Hq(X; Q) →· · · .
Exercise 54. Prove that the map δ : Hq−1(X; Q/Z) →Hq(X; Z) maps
onto the torsion subgroup T of Hq(X; Z).
(The map δ is a Bockstein homomorphism; see Section 10.4)
The bilinear map
Q/Z × Z →Q/Z,
(a, b) →ab
is non-degenerate, in fact induces an isomorphism Q/Z ⊗Z →Q/Z. This
bilinear map can be used to deﬁne a cup product
Hq−1(X; Q/Z) × Hq(X; Z) →H2q−1(X; Q/Z)
(3.10)
as in Exercise 36.
Now suppose that M is a closed manifold of dimension 2k −1.
Let
T ⊂Hk(M; Z) denote the torsion subgroup.
Exercise 55. Prove that the linking pairing of M
T × T →Q/Z
deﬁned by
(a, b) →⟨δ−1(a) ∪b, [M]⟩
is well-deﬁned. Here δ−1(a) means any element z in Hk−1(M; Q/Z) with
δ(z) = a.
Show that this pairing is skew symmetric if dim(M) = 4k + 1 and sym-
metric if dim(M) = 4k −1.
It is a little bit harder to show that this pairing is non-singular (the proof
uses Exercise 53 in the same way that the corresponding fact for the free part
of cohomology is used to show that the intersection pairing is non-singular.)


Chapter 4
Fiber Bundles
Fiber bundles form a nice class of maps in topology, and many naturally
occurring maps are ﬁber bundles. A theorem of Hurewicz says that ﬁber
bundles are ﬁbrations, and ﬁbrations are a natural class of maps to study in
algebraic topology, as we will soon see. There are several alternate notions of
ﬁber bundles and their relationships with one another is somewhat technical.
The standard reference is Steenrod’s book [37].
A ﬁber bundle is also called a Hurewicz ﬁber bundle or a locally trivial
ﬁber bundle. The word “ﬁber” is often spelled “ﬁbre,” even by people who
live in English speaking countries in the Western hemisphere.
4.1. Group actions
Let G be a topological group. This means that G is a topological space and
also a group so that the multiplication map µ : G × G →G, µ(g, h) = gh
and the inversion map ι : G →G, ι(g) = g−1 are continuous.
Deﬁnition 4.1. A topological group G acts on a space X if there is a group
homomorphism G →Homeo(X) such that the “adjoint”
G × X →X
(g, x) →g(x)
is continuous. We will usually write g · x instead of g(x).
The orbit of a point x ∈X is the set Gx = {g · x|g ∈G}.
The orbit space or quotient space X/G is the quotient space X/  , with
the equivalence relation x  g · x.
The ﬁxed set is XG = {x ∈X|g · x = x for all g ∈G}.
An action is called free if g(x) ̸= x for all x ∈X and for all g ̸= e.
77

78
4. Fiber Bundles
An action is called eﬀective if the homomorphism G →Homeo(X) is
injective.
A variant of this deﬁnition requires the homomorphism G →Homeo(X)
to be continuous with respect to the compact-open topology on Homeo(X),
or some other topology, depending on what X is (for example, one could
take the C∞topology on Diﬀ(X) if X is a smooth manifold). Also note that
we have deﬁned a left action of G on X. There is a corresponding notion of
right G-action (x, g) →x · g. For example, one usually takes π1X to act on
the right by covering transformations on the universal cover of X.
4.2. Fiber bundles
We can now give a deﬁnition of ﬁber bundles.
Deﬁnition 4.2. Let G be a topological group acting eﬀectively on a space
F. A ﬁber bundle E over B with ﬁber F and structure group G is a map
p : E →B together with a collection of homeomorphisms {ϕ : U × F →
p−1(U)} for open sets U in B (ϕ is called a chart over U) such that:
1. The diagram
U × F
p−1(U)
U
✲
ϕ
❅
❅❅
❘
pU



✠p
commutes for each chart ϕ over U.
2. Each point of B has a neighborhood over which there is a chart.
3. If ϕ is a chart over U and V ⊂U is open, then the restriction of ϕ to
V is a chart over V .
4. For any charts ϕ, ϕ′ over U, there is a continuous map θϕ,ϕ′ : U →G
so that
ϕ′(u, f) = ϕ(u, θϕ,ϕ′(u) · f)
for all u ∈U and all f ∈F. The map θϕ,ϕ′ is called the transition
function for ϕ, ϕ′.
5. The collection of charts is maximal among collections satisfying the
previous conditions.
The standard terminology is to to call B the base, F is called the
ﬁber, and E is called the total space. For shorthand one often abbreviates
(p, E, B, F) by E.
This deﬁnition of ﬁber bundle is slick and some discussion about the
various requirements helps to understand the concept.

4.2. Fiber bundles
79
A map p : E →B is called a locally trivial bundle if the ﬁrst 3 require-
ments of Deﬁnition 4.2 are met. There is no need to assume that any group
G is acting since this does not enter into the ﬁrst three axioms. Local triv-
iality is the important distinction between a ﬁber bundle and an arbitrary
map.
The fourth condition invokes the structure group G. To understand the
diﬀerence between a locally trivial bundle and a ﬁber bundle, notice that in
a locally trivial bundle, if

implies that there is a map ψϕ,ϕ′ : U × F →F so that the composite
ϕ−1 ◦ϕ′ : U × F →U × F has the formula
(u, f) →(u, ψϕ,ϕ′(u, f)).
For each u ∈U the map ψϕ,ϕ′(u, −) : F →F is a homeomorphism.
In a ﬁber bundle, the map ψϕ,ϕ′ must have a very special form, namely
1. The homeomorphism ψϕ,ϕ′(u, −) : F →F is not arbitrary, but is
given by the action of an element of G, i.e. ψϕ,ϕ′(u, f) = g · f for
some g ∈G independent of f. The element g is denoted by θϕ,ϕ′(u).
2. The topology of G is integrated into the structure by requiring that
θϕ,ϕ′ : U →G be continuous.
The requirement that G act eﬀectively on F implies that the functions
θϕ,ϕ′ : U →G are unique. Although we have included the requirement that
G acts eﬀectively of F in the deﬁnition of a ﬁber bundle, there are certain
circumstances when we will want to relax this condition, particularly when
studying liftings of the structure group, for example, when studying local
coeﬃcients.

80
4. Fiber Bundles
It is not hard to see that a locally trivial bundle is the same thing as a
ﬁber bundle with structure group Homeo(F). One subtlety about the topol-
ogy is that the requirement that G be a topological group acting eﬀectively
on F says only that the homomorphism G →Homeo(F) is injective, but the
inclusion G →Homeo(F) need not be an embedding, nor even continuous.
Exercise 56. Show that the transition functions determine the bundle.
That is, suppose that spaces B and F are given, and an action of a topo-
logical group G on F is speciﬁed.
Suppose also that a collection of pairs T = {(Uα, θα)} with each Uα an
open subset of B and θα : Uα →G a continuous map is given satisfying:
1. The Uα cover B.
2. If (Uα, θα) ∈T and W ⊂Uα, then the restriction (W, θα|W ) is in the
collection T .
3. If (U, θ1) and (U, θ2) are in T , then (U, θ1 · θ2) is in T , where θ1 · θ2
means the pointwise multiplication of functions to G.
4. the collection T is maximal with respect to the ﬁrst three conditions.
Then there exists a ﬁber bundle p : E →B with structure group G, ﬁber
F, and transition functions θα.
The third condition in Exercise 56 is a hidden form of the famous “co-
cycle condition”. Brieﬂy what this means is the following. In an alternative
deﬁnition of a ﬁber bundle one starts with a ﬁxed open cover {Ui} and a
single function φi : Ui × F →p−1(Ui) of each open set Ui of the cover.
Then to each pair of open sets Ui, Uj in the cover one requires there exists
a function θi,j : Ui ∩Uj →G so that (on Ui ∩Uj)
φ−1
i
◦φj(u, f) = (u, θi,j(u) · f).
A G-valued ˇCech 1-cochain for the cover {Ui} is just a collection of maps
θi,j : Ui ∩Uj →G and so a ﬁber bundle with structure group G determines
a ˇCech 1-cochain.
From this point of view the third condition of the exercise translates
into the requirement that for each triple Ui, Uj and Uk the restrictions of
the various θ satisfy
θi,j · θj,k = θi,k : Ui ∩Uj ∩Uk →G.
In the ˇCech complex this condition is just the requirement that the ˇCech
1-cochain deﬁned by the θi,j is in fact a cocycle.
This is a useful method of understanding bundles since it relates them
to (ˇCech) cohomology. Cohomologous cochains deﬁne isomorphic bundles,
and so equivalence classes of bundles over B with structure group G can be

4.3. Examples of ﬁber bundles
81
identiﬁed with H1(B; G) (this is one starting point for the theory of charac-
teristic classes; we will take a diﬀerent point of view in a later chapter). One
must be extremely cautious when working this out carefully. For example,
G need not be abelian (and so what does H1(B; G) mean?) Also, one must
consider continuous cocycles since the θi,j should be continuous functions.
We will not pursue this line of exposition any further in this book.
We will frequently use the notation F →E

to indicate a ﬁber bundle p : E →B with ﬁber F.
4.3. Examples of ﬁber bundles
The following are some examples of locally trivial bundles. We will revisit
these and many more examples in greater detail in Section 6.14.
1. The trivial bundle is the projection pB : B × F →B.
2. If F has the discrete topology, any locally trivial bundle over B with
ﬁber F is a covering space; conversely if p : E →B is a covering space
with B connected, then p is a locally trivial bundle with discrete ﬁber.
3. The M¨obius strip mapping onto its core circle is a locally trivial bun-
dle with ﬁber [0, 1].
4. The tangent bundle of a smooth manifold is a locally trivial bundle.
Exercise 57. Show that a ﬁber bundle with with trivial structure group is
(isomorphic to) a trivial bundle.
4.3.1. Vector bundles.
Exercise 58. Let F = Rn, and let G = GLnR ⊂Homeo(Rn). A ﬁber
bundle over B with ﬁber Rn and structure group GLn(R) is a vector bundle
of dimension n over B. Explicitly, show that each ﬁber p−1{b} can be given
a well-deﬁned vector space structure.
(Similarly, one can take F = Cn, G = GLn(C) to get complex vector
bundles.)
In particular, if M is a diﬀerentiable n-manifold, and TM is the set of
all tangent vectors to M then p : TM →M is a vector bundle of dimension
n.

4. Fiber Bundles
4.3.2. Bundles over S2. For every integer n ≥0, we can construct an S1
bundle over S2 with structure group SO(2); n is called the Euler number
of the bundle. For n = 0, we have the product bundle p : S2 × S1 →S2.
For n ≥1, deﬁne a 3-dimensional lens space L3
n = S3/Zn, where the action
is given by letting the generator of Zn on act on S3 ⊂C2 by (z1, z2) →
(ζnz1, ζnz2) (here ζn = exp2πi/n is a primitive n-th root of unity). For n = 2,
the lens space is just real projective space RP 3. Deﬁne the S1-bundle with
Euler number n ≥1 by p : L3
n →S2 = C ∪∞by [z1, z2] →z1/z2.
When n = 1 we obtain the famous Hopf bundle S1 →S3 →S2. For
n > 1 the Hopf map S3 →S2 factors through the quotient map S3 →L3
n,
and the ﬁbers of the bundle with Euler number n are S1/Zn which is again
homeomorphic to S1.
Exercise 59. Let S(TS2) be the sphere bundle of the tangent bundle of
the 2-sphere, i.e. the tangent vectors of unit length, speciﬁcally
S(TS2) = {(P, v) ∈R3 × R3|P, v ∈S2 and P · v = 0}.
Let SO(3) be the 3-by-3 orthogonal matrices of determinant one (the group
of orientation preserving rigid motions of R3 preserving the origin). This is
a topological group. Show that the spaces S(TS2), SO(3), and RP 3 are all
homeomorphic.
(Hint.
1. Given two perpendicular vectors in R3, a third one can be obtained
by the cross product.
2. On one hand, every element of SO(3) is rotation about an axis, on
the other hand RP 3 is D3/, where you identify antipodal points on
the boundary sphere.)
This gives three incarnations of the S1-bundle over S2 with Euler number
equal to 2:

E = (X × [0, 1/2] × F) ⨿(X × [1/2, 1] × F)
∼
where the equivalence relation is given by identifying (x, 0, f) ∼(x′, 0, f),
(x, 1, f) ∼(x′, 1, f), and (x, 1/2, f) ∼(x, 1/2, β(x)f), where the last relation
glues the summands of the disjoint union. This bundle is called the bundle
over ΣX with clutching function β : X →G ⊂Aut(F).
Exercise 60. Show that projection onto the ﬁrst two coordinates gives a
ﬁber bundle p : E →ΣX with ﬁber F and structure group G. Give some
examples with X = S0 and X = S1. In particular, show that the S1-bundle
over S2 = ΣS1 with Euler number equal to n is obtained by clutching using
a degree n map S1 →S1.
Clutching provides a good way to describe ﬁber bundles over spheres.
For X a CW-complex, all bundles over ΣX arise by this clutching construc-
tion. This follows from the fact that any ﬁber bundle over a contractible
CW-complex is trivial (this can be proven using obstruction theory). Since
ΣX is the union of two contractible spaces, X × [0, 1
2]/ ∼and X × [1
2, 1]/ ∼,
any bundle over ΣX is obtained by clutching two trivial bundles over X.
4.3.4. Local coeﬃcients and other structures. An important type of
ﬁber bundle is the following. Let A be a group and G a subgroup of the
automorphism group Aut(A). Then any ﬁber bundle E over B with ﬁber
A and structure group G has the property that each ﬁber p−1{b} has a
group structure. This group is isomorphic to A, but the isomorphism is not
canonical in general.
We have already run across an important case of this, namely vector
bundles, where A = Rn and G = GLn(R).
In particular, if A is a abelian group with the discrete topology, then
p : E →B is a covering space and is called a system of local coeﬃcients on
B. The terminology will be explained later.
Exercise 61. Deﬁne local coeﬃcient systems for R-modules, R a commu-
tative ring, generalizing the case of Z-modules above.
The basic principle at play here is if the structure group preserves a
certain structure on F, then every ﬁber p−1{b} has this structure.
For ex-
ample, a local coeﬃcient system corresponds to the case when the structure
group is a subgroup of the group of automorphisms of the ﬁber, a discrete
abelian group. A vector bundle corresponds to the case when the structure
group corresponds to the group of linear transformations of a vector space.
Other examples of ﬁbers with a structure that one could consider include
the following.

4. Fiber Bundles
1. F is a real vector space with an inner product, G = O(F, ⟨, ⟩) ⊂
GL(F) consists of those linear isomorphisms which preserve the inner
product. The resulting ﬁber bundle is called a vector bundle with an
orthogonal structure.
2. Similarly one can deﬁne a complex vector bundle with hermitian struc-
ture by taking F to be a complex vector space with a hermitian inner
product.
3. Taking this further, let F be a riemannian manifold and suppose that
G acts isometrically on F. Then each ﬁber in a ﬁber bundle with
structure group G and ﬁber F will be (non-canonically) isometric to
F.
4. Take F to be a smooth manifold and G a subgroup of the diﬀeomor-
phism group of F (with the C∞strong topology, say). Then each
ﬁber in a ﬁber bundle with structure group G will be diﬀeomorphic
to F.
Exercise 62. Invent your own examples of ﬁbers with structure and the
corresponding ﬁber bundles.
4.4. Principal bundles and associated bundles
Principal bundles are special cases of ﬁber bundles, but nevertheless can be
used to construct any ﬁber bundle. Conversely any ﬁber bundle determines
a principal bundle. A principal bundle is technically simpler, since the ﬁber
is just F = G with a canonical action.
Let G be a topological group. It acts on itself by left translation.
G →Homeo(G),
g →(x →gx).
Deﬁnition 4.3. A principal G-bundle over B is a ﬁber bundle p : P →B
with ﬁber F = G and structure group G acting by left translations.
Proposition 4.4. If p : P →B is a principal G-bundle, then G acts freely
on P on the right with orbit space B.
Proof. Notice ﬁrst that G acts on the local trivializations on the right:
(U × G) × G →U × G
(u, g) · g′ = (u, gg′).
This commutes with the action of G on itself by left translation (i.e. (g′′g)g′ =
g′′(gg′)), so one gets a well-deﬁned right action of G on E using the identi-
ﬁcation provided by a chart
U × G
ϕ
−→p−1(U).

4.4. Principal bundles and associated bundles
85
More explicitly, deﬁne ϕ(u, g) · g′ = ϕ(u, gg′). If ϕ′ is another chart over U,
then
ϕ(u, g) = ϕ′(u, θϕ,ϕ′(u)g),
and ϕ(u, gg′) = ϕ′(u, θϕ,ϕ′(u)(gg′)) = ϕ′(u, (θϕ,ϕ′(u)g)g′), so the action in
independent of the choice of chart. The action is free, since the local action
(U × G) × G →U × G is free, and since U × G/G = U it follows that
E/G = B.
As a familiar example, any regular covering space p : E →B is a princi-
pal G-bundle with G = π1B/p∗π1E. Here G is given the discrete topology.
In particular, the universal covering ˜B →B of a space is a principal π1B-
bundle. A non-regular covering space is not a principal G-bundle.
Exercise 63. Any free (right) action of a ﬁnite group G on a (Hausdorﬀ)
space E gives a regular cover and hence a principal G-bundle E →E/G.
The converse to Proposition 4.4 holds in some important cases.
We
state the following fundamental theorem without proof, referring you to [5,
Theorem II.5.8].
Theorem 4.5. Suppose that X is a compact Hausdorﬀspace, and G is a
compact Lie group acting freely on X. Then the orbit map
X →X/G
is a principal G-bundle.
4.4.1. Construction of ﬁber bundles from principal bundles. Exer-
cise 56 shows that the transition functions θα : Uα →G and the action of G
on F determine a ﬁber bundle over B with ﬁber F and structure group G.
As an application note that if a topological group G acts on spaces F
and F ′, and if p : E →B is a ﬁber bundle with ﬁber F and structure group
G, then one can use the transition functions from p to deﬁne a ﬁber bundle
p′ : E′ →B with ﬁber F ′ and structure group G with exactly the same
transition functions.
This is called changing the ﬁber from F to F ′. This can be useful because
the topology of E and E′ may change. For example, take G = GL2(R),
F = R2, F ′ = R2 −{0} and the tangent bundle of the 2-sphere.

R2 −{0}
TS2 −z(S2)
S2

❄
p
where z : S2 →TS2 denotes the zero section.
With the second incarnation of the bundle the twisting becomes revealed
in the homotopy type, because the total space of the ﬁrst bundle has the
homotopy type of S2, while the total space of the second has the homotopy
type of the sphere bundle S(TS2) and hence of RP 3 according to Exercise
59.
A fundamental case of changing ﬁbers occurs when one lets the ﬁber F ′
be the group G itself, with the left translation action. Then the transition
functions for the ﬁber bundle

We call this principal G-bundle the principal G-bundle underlying the ﬁber
bundle p : E →B with structure group G.
Conversely, to a principal G-bundle and an action of G on a space F
one can associate a ﬁber bundle, again using Exercise 56. An alternative
construction is given in the following deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 4.6. Let p : P →B be a principal G-bundle. Suppose G acts
on the left on a space F, i.e. an action G × F →F is given. Deﬁne the
Borel construction
P ×G F
to be the quotient space P × F/ ∼where
(x, f) ∼(xg, g−1f).
(We are continuing to assume that G acts on F on the left and by Proposition
4.4 it acts freely on the principal bundle P on the right).

4.4. Principal bundles and associated bundles
87
Let [x, f] ∈P ×G F denote the equivalence classes of (x, f). Deﬁne a
map
q : P ×G F →B
by the formula [x, f] →p(x).
The following important exercise shows that the two ways of going from
a principal G-bundle to a ﬁber bundle with ﬁber F and structure group G
are the same.
Exercise 64. If p : P →B is a principal G-bundle and G acts on F, then
F
P ×G F
B
✲
❄
q
where q[x, f] = p(x), is a ﬁber bundle over B with ﬁber F and structure
group G which has the same transition functions as p : P →B.
We say q : E ×G F →B is the ﬁber bundle associated to the principal
bundle p : E →B via the action of G on F.
Thus principal bundles are more basic that ﬁber bundles, in the sense
that the ﬁber and its G-action are explicit, namely G acting on itself by left
translation. Moreover, any ﬁber bundle with structure group G is associated
to a principal G-bundle by specifying an action of G on a space F. Many
properties of bundles become more visible when stated in the context of
principal bundles.
The following exercise gives a diﬀerent method of constructing the prin-
cipal bundle underlying a vector bundle, without using transition functions.
Exercise 65. Let p : E →B be a vector bundle with ﬁber Rn and structure
group GL(n, R). Deﬁne a space F(E) to be the space of frames in E, so
that a point in F(E) is a pair (b, f) where b ∈B and f = (f1, · · · , fn) is a
basis for the vector space p−1(b). There is an obvious map q : F(E) →B.
Prove that q : F(E) →B is a principal GL(n, R)-bundle, and that
E = F(E) ×GL(n,R) Rn
where GL(n, R) acts on Rn in the usual way.
For example, given a representation of GL(n, R), that is, a homomor-
phism ρ : GL(n, R) →GL(k, R), one can form a new vector bundle
F(E) ×ρ Rk
over B.
An important set of examples comes from this construction by starting
with the tangent bundle of a smooth manifold M. The principal bundle

88
4. Fiber Bundles
F(TM) is called the frame bundle of M. Any representation of GL(n, R)
on a vector space V gives a vector bundle with ﬁber isomorphic to V . Im-
portant representations include the alternating representations GL(n, R) →
p(Hom(Rn, R)) from which one obtains the vector bundles of diﬀerential
p-forms over M.
We next give one application of the Borel construction. Recall that a
local coeﬃcient system is a ﬁber bundle over B with ﬁber A and structure
group G where A is a (discrete) abelian group and G acts via a homomor-
phism G →Aut(A).
Lemma 4.7. Every local coeﬃcient system over a path-connected (and semi-
locally simply connected) space B is of the form
A
˜B ×π1B A
B
✲
❄
q
i.e., is associated to the principal π1B-bundle given by the universal cover
˜B of B where the action is given by a homomorphism π1B →Aut(A).
In other words the group G ⊂Aut(A) can be replaced by the discrete
group π1B. Notice that in general one cannot assume that the homomor-
phism π1B →Aut(A) is injective, and so this is a point where we would
wish to relax the requirement that the structure group acts eﬀectively on the
ﬁber. Alternatively, one can take the structure group to be π1(B)/ ker(φ)
where φ : π1(B) →Aut(A) is the corresponding representation.
Sketch of proof. It is easy to check that q : ˜B ×π1B A →B is a local
coeﬃcient system, i.e. a ﬁber bundle with ﬁber on abelian group A and
structure group mapping to Aut(A).
Suppose that p : E →B is any local coeﬃcient system.
Any loop
γ : (I, ∂I) →(B, ∗) has a unique lift to E starting at a given point in
p−1(∗), since A is discrete so that E →B is a covering space.
Fix an
identiﬁcation of p−1(∗) with A, given by a chart. Then the various lifts of γ
starting at points of A deﬁne, by taking the end point, a function A →A.
The fact that p : E →B has structure group Aut(A) easily implies
that this function is an automorphism. Since E is a covering space of B,
the function only depends on the homotopy class, and so we get a map
π1(B, ∗) →Aut(A). This is clearly a homomorphism since if ˜γ1, ˜γ2 are lifts
starting at a, b, then ˜γ1 + ˜γ2 (addition in A) is the lift of γ1γ2 (multiplication
in π1) and starts at a + b. A standard covering space argument implies that
E = ˜B ×π1B A.

4.5. Reducing the structure group
89
4.5. Reducing the structure group
In some circumstances, given a subgroup H of G and a ﬁber bundle p : E →
B with structure group G, one can view the bundle as a ﬁber bundle with
structure group H. When this is possible, we say the structure group can be
reduced to H.
Proposition 4.8. Let H be a topological subgroup of the topological group
G.
Let H act on G by left translation.
Let q : Q →B be a principal
H-bundle. Then
G
Q ×H G
B

❄
q
is a principal G-bundle.
The proof is easy; one approach is to consider the transition functions
θ : U →H as functions to G using the inclusion H ⊂G.
To satisfy
maximality of the charts it may be necessary to add extra charts whose
transition functions into G map outside of H.
Exercise 66. Prove Proposition 4.8.
Deﬁnition 4.9. Given a principal G-bundle p : E →B we say the structure
group G can be reduced to H for some subgroup H ⊂G if there exists a
principal H-bundle Q →B and a commutative diagram

so that the map r is G-equivariant. For a ﬁber bundle, we say the struc-
ture group reduces if the structure group of the underlying principal bundle
reduces.
If we are willing to relax the requirement that the structure group acts
eﬀectively, then we can just assume that we are given a homomorphism
H →G rather than an inclusion of a subgroup.
Proposition 4.8 holds
without change.
In this more general context, for example, Lemma 4.7
states that any ﬁber bundle over B with discrete ﬁber can have its structure
group reduced to π1B.
Exercise 67. Show that every real vector bundle (i.e. ﬁber bundle with
structure group GL(n, R) acting on Rn in the usual way) over a paracom-
pact base can have its structure group reduced to the orthogonal group
O(n). (Hint: use a partition of unity.)

90
4. Fiber Bundles
Another subtle point is that there may be several “inequivalent” reduc-
tions. An example concerns orientability and orientation of vector bundles.
Deﬁnition 4.10. A real vector bundle is called orientable if its structure
group can be reduced to the subgroup GL+(n, R) of matrices with positive
determinant.
For example, a smooth manifold is orientable if and only if its tangent
bundle is orientable. A more detailed discussion of orientability for manifolds
and vector bundles can be found in Section 10.7.
For the following exercise it may help to read the deﬁnition of a map
between ﬁber bundles in the next section.
Exercise 68. Prove that an orientable vector bundle can be oriented in
two incompatible ways, that is, the structure group can be reduced from
GL(n, R) to GL+(n, R) (or, using Exercise 67, from O(n) to SO(n)) in two
ways so that the identity map Id: E →E is a not a map of ﬁber bundles
with structure group GL+(n, R) (or SO(n)).
4.6. Maps of bundles and pullbacks
The concept of morphisms of ﬁber bundles is subtle, especially when there
are diﬀerent ﬁbers and structure groups. Rather than to try to work in
the greatest generality, we will just deﬁne one of many possible notions of
morphism.
Deﬁnition 4.11. A morphism of ﬁber bundles with structure group G and
ﬁber F from E →B to E′ →B′ is a pair of continuous maps ˜f : E →E′
and f : B →B′ so that the diagram

commutes and so that for each chart φ : U × F →p−1(U) with b ∈U and
chart φ′ : U′ × F →p−1(U′) and each b ∈U with f(b) ∈U′ the composite
{b} × F
p−1(b)

is a homeomorphism given by the action of an element ψφ,φ′(b) ∈G. More-
over, b →ψφ,φ′(b) should deﬁne a continuous map from U ∩f−1(U′) to
G.
As you can see, this is a technical deﬁnition.
Notice that the ﬁbers
are mapped homeomorphically by a map of ﬁber bundles of this type. In

4.6. Maps of bundles and pullbacks
91
particular, an isomorphism of ﬁber bundles is a map of ﬁber bundles ( ˜f, f)
which admits a map (˜g, g) in the reverse direction so that both composites
are the identity.
One important type of ﬁber bundle map is a gauge transformation. This
is a bundle map from a bundle to itself which covers the identity map of the
base, i.e. the following diagram commutes.

By deﬁnition g restricts to an isomorphism given by the action of an element
of the structure group on each ﬁber. The set of all gauge transformations
forms a group.
One way in which morphisms of ﬁber bundles arise is from a pullback
construction.
Deﬁnition 4.12. Suppose that a ﬁber bundle p : E →B with ﬁber F and
structure group G is given, and that f : B′ →B is some continuous function.
Deﬁne the pullback of p : E →B by f to be the space
f∗(E) = {(b′, e) ∈B′ × E | p(e) = f(b′)}.
Let q : f∗(E) →B be the restriction of the projection E ×B →B to f∗(E).

over U ⊂B, then f−1(U) is open in B′ and ϕ induces a homeomorphism
f−1(U) × F →f∗(E)|f−1(U). We leave the details as an exercise.

Chapter 5
Homology with Local
Coeﬃcients
When studying the homotopy theory of non-simply connected spaces, one
is often led to consider an action of the fundamental group on some abelian
group. Local coeﬃcient systems are a tool to organize this information. The
theory becomes more complicated by the fact that one must consider non-
commutative rings. It is possible to learn a good deal of homotopy theory by
restricting only to simply connected spaces, but fundamental group issues
are ubiquitous in geometric topology.
There are two approaches to constructing the complexes giving the ho-
mology and cohomology of a space with local coeﬃcients. The ﬁrst is more
algebraic, and takes the point of view that the fundamental chain complex
associated to a space X is the singular (or cellular) complex of the univer-
sal cover ˜X, viewed as a chain complex over the group ring Z[π1X]. From
this point of view local coeﬃcients are nothing more than modules over the
group ring Z[π1X].
The second approach is more topological; one takes a local coeﬃcient
system over X (i.e. a ﬁber bundle over X whose ﬁbers are abelian groups and
whose transition functions take values in the automorphisms of the group)
and deﬁne a chain complex by taking the chains to be formal sums of singular
simplices (or cells) such that the coeﬃcient of a simplex is an element in the
ﬁber over that simplex (hence the terminology local coeﬃcients). Each of
these two points of view has its strengths; Lemma 4.7 is the basic result
which identiﬁes the two.

5. Homology with Local Coeﬃcients
In this chapter we will work with Z-modules, (i.e. abelian groups) and
modules over integral group rings Zπ. Everything generalizes appropriately
for R-modules and Rπ-modules for any commutative ring R.
5.1. Deﬁnition of homology with twisted
coeﬃcients
We begin with the deﬁnition of a group ring.
Deﬁnition 5.1. The group ring Zπ is a ring associated to a group π. Ad-
ditively it is the free abelian group on π, i.e., elements are (ﬁnite) linear
combinations of the group elements
m1g1 + · · · + mkgk
mi ∈Z,
gi ∈π.
Multiplication is given by the distributive law and multiplication in π:
(

i
migi)(

j
njhj) =

i,j
(minj)(gihj).
In working with group rings the group π is always written multiplica-
tively, and if e is the identity of the group, e is written as 1, since this
element forms the unit in the ring Zπ. To avoid confusing notation we will
sometimes write Z[π] instead of Zπ.
Two examples of group rings (with their standard notation) are
Z[Z] = Z[t, t−1] = {a−jt−j + · · · + a0 + · · · + aktk | an ∈Z}
(this ring is called the ring of Laurent polynomials) and
Z[Z/2] = Z[t]/(t2 −1) = {a + bt | a, b ∈Z}.
We will work with modules over Zπ. If π is a non-abelian group, the
ring Zπ is not commutative, and so one must distinguish between left and
right modules.
Let A be an abelian group and
ρ : π →AutZ(A)
be a homomorphism. (The standard terminology is to call either ρ or A a
representation of π.) The representation ρ endows A with the structure of
a left Zπ-module by taking the action
(

g∈π
mgg) · a =

g∈π
mg ρ(g)(a).
Conversely if A is a left module over a group ring Zπ, there is homomorphism
ρ : π →AutZ(A)

4.1. DEFINITION
97
given by (g →(a →ga)) where ga is multiplying a ∈A by g ∈Zπ. Thus
a representation of a group π on an abelian group is the same thing as a
Zπ-module.
Exercise 71. Let A be a ﬁnitely generated (left) module over Z[Z/2] so
that, as an abelian group, A is ﬁnitely generated and torsion free. Show
that A is a direct sum of modules of the form Z+, Z−, and Z[Z/2]. Here
Z+ is the trivial Z[Z/2]-module corresponding to the trivial homomorphism
ρ : Z/2 →Aut(Z) and Z−corresponds to the non-trivial homomorphism.
We brieﬂy outline the deﬁnition of the tensor product in the non–
commutative case.
Deﬁnition 5.2. If R is a ring (possibly non-commutative), M is a right
R-module, and N is a left R-module (sometimes one writes MR and RN),
then the tensor product M ⊗R N is an abelian group satisfying the adjoint
property
HomZ(M ⊗R N, A) ∼= HomR(M, HomZ(N, A))
for any abelian group A. The corresponding universal property is that there
is a Z-bilinear map φ : M × N →M ⊗R N, so that φ(mr, n) = φ(m, rn),
and this map is initial in the category of Z-bilinear maps φ : M × N →A,
satisfying φ(mr, n) = φ(m, rn).
The tensor product is constructed by taking the free abelian group on
M × N and modding out by the expected relations. Elements of M ⊗R N
are denoted by

mi ⊗ni.
The relation mr ⊗n = m ⊗rn holds. (This is why we take a right module
tensored with a left module.)
Exercise 72. Compute the abelian group Z+ ⊗Z[Z/2] Z−(see Exercise 71).
The starting point in the algebraic construction of homology with local
coeﬃcients is the observation that the singular chain complex of the universal
cover of a space is a right Zπ-module.
To proceed, ﬁx a path connected and locally path-connected space X
with a base point which admits a universal cover. For notational ease set
π = π1X. Let 
X →X be the universal cover of X, with its usual right π1X-
action obtained by identifying π with the group of covering transformations.
Then the singular complex S∗( 
X) of the universal cover (with integer co-

5. Homology with Local Coeﬃcients
We can now give the algebraic deﬁnition of homology with local coeﬃ-
cients.
Deﬁnition 5.3. Given a Zπ-module A, form the tensor product
S∗(X; A) = S∗( 
X)⊗Zπ A.
This is a chain complex whose homology is called the homology of X with
local coeﬃcients in A and is denoted by H∗(X; A).
Notice that since the ring Zπ is non-commutative (except if π is abelian),
the tensored chain complex only has the structure of a chain complex over
Z, not Zπ. Thus the homology group H∗(X; A) is only a Z-module.
If the Zπ-module is speciﬁed by a representation ρ : π1X →Aut(A) for
some abelian group A, and we wish to emphasize the representation, we will
sometimes embellish A with the subscript ρ and write H∗(X; Aρ) for the
homology with coeﬃcients in A. It is also common to call H∗(X; Aρ) the
homology of X twisted by ρ : π1X →Aut(A).
Before we look at examples, we will give the corresponding deﬁnition
of cohomology.
A new wrinkle which appears is that since the functor
HomZπ(−, −) is deﬁned on the category of pairs of right R-modules or of
pairs of left R-modules, we need to either change S∗( 
X) to a left Zπ-module
or consider coeﬃcients in right Zπ-modules. We opt for the former.
Thus transform S∗( 
X) into a left Zπ-module by the (standard) proce-
dure:
g · z :=
def z · g−1.
Deﬁnition 5.4. Given a left Zπ-module A form the cochain complex
S∗(X; A) = HomZπ(S∗( 
X), A).
(This means the set of group homomorphisms f : S∗( 
X) →A which satisfy
f(rz) = rf(z) for all r ∈Zπ and z ∈S∗( 
X).)
The cohomology of this complex is called the cohomology of X with local
coeﬃcients in A, and is denoted by
H∗(X; A).
If the module A is deﬁned by a representation ρ : π1X →Aut(A) for an
abelian group A, the cohomology with local coeﬃcients may be denoted by
H∗(X; Aρ) and is often called the cohomology of X twisted by ρ.
5.2. Examples and basic properties
The (ordinary) homology and cohomology groups are just special cases of the
homology and cohomology with local coeﬃcients corresponding to twisting
by the trivial representations ρ as we now show.

5.2. Examples and basic properties
99
If ρ : π1X →Aut(A) is is the trivial homomorphism, then the deﬁnition
of tensor product gives a chain map
S∗( 
X)⊗ZπAρ →S∗X⊗ZA
which we will see is an isomorphism.
(In the chain complex on the left
A is considered only as an abelian group.) This follows since both S∗( 
X)
and S∗(X) are chain complexes of free modules so it is easy to compute
tensor products. The complex S∗( 
X) is a free Zπ-chain complex since π
acts freely on 
X, and hence on the set of all singular simplices in 
X. We
obtain a Zπ basis by choosing a representative simplex for each orbit. Better
yet, for each singular simplex σ : ∆n →X, choose a single lift ˜σ : ∆n →

X. Then the set {˜σ} gives a basis for S∗( 
X) over Zπ and it follows that
S∗( 
X)⊗ZπAρ
→
S∗X⊗ZA is an isomorphism of graded abelian groups;
from this description it is not hard to check that this isomorphism is a chain
map, and so Hk(X; Aρ) = Hk(X; A), the usual homology with coeﬃcients
in (the underlying Z-module) A.
Similarly,
HomZπ(S∗
X, A) ∼= HomZ(S∗X, A)
so Hk(X; Aρ) ∼= Hk(X; A), the usual cohomology with coeﬃcients in A.
Exercise 73. Show that the natural map
HomZ(S∗X, A) →HomZπ(S∗
X, A)
is a chain isomorphism.
At the other extreme we consider what happens if A is a (ﬁnitely gener-
ated) free Zπ-module. Since the tensor product and Hom functors respect
direct sums, it suﬃces to consider the case when A = Zπ.
Then,
S∗
X⊗ZπZπ = S∗
X,
and therefore
Hk(X; Zπ) = Hk( 
X; Z),
the (untwisted) integral homology of the universal cover.
In other words, the homology with local coeﬃcients given by the tauto-
logical representation ρ : π →Aut(Zπ)
ρ(g) = (

mhh →

mhgh)
equals the homology of 
X with (untwisted) Z coeﬃcients.
Exercise 74. Let M be an abelian group with the trivial left π action. Let
A = Zπ ⊗Z M; notice that A has a left Zπ-module structure deﬁned by
g · (x ⊗m) = (gx) ⊗M.
Show that the homology H∗(X; A) is just the
(ordinary) homology of 
X with coeﬃcients in M.

100
5. Homology with Local Coeﬃcients
Exercise 75. (Shapiro’s Lemma) Show that if H ⊂π is a subgroup and
A = Z[π/H] viewed as a left π-module, then the corresponding homology is
isomorphic to the homology of the H-cover of X. Generalize this as in the
previous exercise to include other coeﬃcients. (Hint: try the case when H
is normal ﬁrst.)
These examples and the two exercises show that the (untwisted) homol-
ogy of any cover of X with any coeﬃcients can be obtained as a special case
of the homology of X with appropriate local coeﬃcients.
One might ask whether the same facts hold for cohomology.
They
do not without some modiﬁcation.
If A = Zπ, then the cochain com-
plex HomZπ(S∗
X, A) is not in general isomorphic to HomZ(S∗X, Z) and
so Hk(X; Zπ) is not equal to Hk( 
X; Z). It turns out that if X is compact
Hk(X; Zπ) ∼= Hk
c ( 
X; Z), the compactly supported cohomology of 
X.
5.2.1. Cellular methods. If X is a (connected) CW-complex then homol-
ogy and cohomology with local coeﬃcients can be deﬁned using the cellular
chain complex; this is much better for computations. If p : 
X →X is the
universal cover, then 
X inherits a CW-structure from X – the cells of 
X
are the path components of the inverse images of cells of X. The action of
π = π1X on 
X gives C∗( 
X) the structure of a Zπ-chain complex. For each
cell e of X, choose a cell e above 
X; this gives a Zπ-basis for C∗( 
X).
For example, let X = RP n with n > 1. Then X = e0 ∪e1 ∪· · · ∪en.
Then 
X = Sn and the corresponding cell decomposition is
Sn = e+
0 ∪e−
0 ∪e+
1 ∪e−
1 ∪· · · ∪e+
n ∪e−
n
with e±
i being the (open) upper and lower hemispheres of the i-sphere. A
basis for the free (rank 1) Zπ-module Ci( 
X) is e+
i . With this choice of basis
the Zπ-chain complex C∗( 
X) is isomorphic to
Z[Z/2] →· · ·
Z[Z/2]
Z[Z/2]
Z[Z/2] →0.

Writing down this complex is the main step in the standard computation
of C∗(RP n) as in [41]: ﬁrst use the homology of Sn and induction on n
to compute C∗( 
X) as a Z[Z/2]-chain complex, then compute C∗(RP n) =
C∗( 
X) ⊗Zπ Z.
The following exercises are important in gaining insight into what infor-
mation homology with local coeﬃcients captures.
Exercise 76. Compute the cellular chain complex C∗(
S1) as a Z[t, t−1]-
module. Compute Hk(S1; Aρ) and Hk(S1; Aρ) for any abelian group A and
any homomorphism ρ : π1S1 = Z →Aut(A).

5.2. Examples and basic properties

Exercise 77. Let ρ : π1(RP n)
∼
=
−→Z/2 = Aut(Z). Compute Hk(RP n; Zρ)
and Hk(RP n; Zρ) and compare to the untwisted homology and cohomology.
Exercise 78. Let p and q be a relatively prime pair of integers and denote
by L(p,q) the 3-dimensional Lens space L(p,q) = S3/(Z/p), where Z/p = ⟨t⟩
acts on S3 ⊂C2 via
t(Z,W) = (ζZ,ζqW)
(ζ = e2πi/p). Let ρ : Z/p →Aut(Z/n) = Z/(n −1) for n prime. Compute
Hk(L(p,q); (Z/n)ρ) and Hk(L(p,q); (Z/n)ρ).
Exercise 79. Let K be the Klein bottle. Compute Hn(K; Zρ) for all twist-
ings ρ of Z (i.e. all ρ : π1K →Z/2 = Aut(Z)).
5.2.2. The orientation double cover and Poincar´e duality. An im-
portant application of local coeﬃcients is its use in studying the algebraic
topology of non-orientable manifolds.
Theorem 5.5. Any n-dimensional manifold M has a double cover
p : MO →M
where MO is an oriented manifold.
Moreover, for any point x ∈M, if
p−1{x} = {x1, x2}, then the orientations µx1 ∈Hn(MO, MO −{x1}) and
µx2 ∈Hn(MO, MO −{x2}) map (by the induced homomorphism p∗) to the
two generators of Hn(M, M −{x}).
Proof. As a set MO = {a ∈Hn(M, M−{x}) | a is a generator and x ∈M}.
As for the topology, let V be a open set in X and z ∈Zn(M, M−V ) a relative
cycle. Then let
Vz = {Im [z] ∈Hn(M, M −{x}) | x ∈V and Z · Im [z] = Hn(M, M −{x})}.
Then {Vz} is a basis for the topology on MO. For more details see [23].
For example, consider RP n for n even. The orientation double cover is
Sn; the deck transformation reverses orientation. For RP n for n odd, the
orientation double cover is a disjoint union of two copies of RP n, oriented
with the opposite orientations.
If M is a connected manifold, deﬁne the orientation character or the
ﬁrst Stiefel–Whitney class
w : π1M →{±1}
by w[γ] = 1 if γ lifts to a loop in the orientation double cover and w[γ] = −1
if γ lifts to a path which is not a loop. Intuitively, w[γ] = −1 if going around
the loop γ reverses the orientation. M is orientable if and only if w is trivial.
Clearly w is a homomorphism.

102
5. Homology with Local Coeﬃcients
Corollary 5.6. Any manifold with H1(M; Z/2) = 0 is orientable.
Proof. This is because
H1(M; Z/2) ∼= Hom(H1M; Z/2) ∼= Hom(π1M; Z/2),
where the ﬁrst isomorphism follows from the universal coeﬃcient theorem
and the second from the Hurewicz theorem
H1M ∼= π1M/[π1M, π1M].
Notice that Aut(Z) = {±1} and so the orientation character deﬁnes
a representation w : π1X →Aut(Z).
The corresponding homology and
cohomology Hk(X; Zw), Hk(X; Zw) is called the homology and cohomology
of X twisted by the orientation character w, or with local coeﬃcients in the
orientation sheaf.
The Poincar´e duality theorem (Theorem 3.26) has an extension to the
non-orientable situation.
Theorem 5.7 (Poincar´e duality theorem). If X is an n-dimensional man-
ifold, connected, compact and without boundary, then
Hn(X; Zw) ∼= Z
and if [X] denotes a generator, then
∩[X] : Hk(X; Zw) →Hn−k(X; Z)
and
∩[X] : Hk(X; Z) →Hn−k(X; Zw)
are isomorphisms.
(This statement of Poincar´e duality applies to non-
orientable manifolds as well as orientable manifolds.)
The Poincar´e–Lefschetz duality theorem also holds in this more general
context.
The cap products in Theorem 5.7 are induced by the bilinear maps on
coeﬃcients Z × Zw →Zw and Zw × Zw →Z as in Exercise 36.
Exercise 80. Check that this works for RP n, n even.
More generally, for a manifold X, and any right Zπ-module A given
by a representation ρ : π →Aut A, let Aw be the module given by the
representation
ρw : π →Aut (A),
g →w(g)ρ(g−1).
Then a stronger form of Poincar´e duality says
∩[X] : Hk(X; A) →Hn−k(X; Aw)

5.3. Deﬁnition of homology with a local coeﬃcient system
103
is an isomorphism.
5.3. Deﬁnition of homology with a local
coeﬃcient system
The previous (algebraic) deﬁnition of homology and cohomology with local
coeﬃcients may appear to depend on base points, via the representation
ρ : π1(X, ∗) →Aut(A).
and the identiﬁcation of π1X with the covering translations of 
X. In fact, it
does not. We now give an alternative deﬁnition, which takes as input only
the local coeﬃcient system itself, i.e. the ﬁber bundle with discrete abelian
group ﬁbers. This deﬁnition is more elegant in that it does not depend on
the arbitrary choice of a base point, but it is harder to compute with.
Let p : E →X be a system of local coeﬃcients with ﬁber a discrete
abelian group A and structure group G ⊂Aut(A). Denote the ﬁbers p−1(x)
by Ex; for each x this is an abelian group non-canonically isomorphic to A.
We construct a chain complex as follows. Let Sk(X; E) denote the set
of formal sums
m

i=1
aiσi
where:
1. σi : ∆k →X is a singular k-simplex, and
2. ai is an element of the group Eσi(e0) where e0 ∈∆k is the base point
(1, 0, 0, · · · , 0) of ∆k.
More precisely, σi(e0) ∈X and we require
ai ∈Eσi(e0) = p−1(σi(e0)).
The obvious way to add elements of Sk(X; E) makes sense and is well-
deﬁned. Thus Sk(X; E) is an abelian group. This is somewhat confusing
since the coeﬃcients lie in diﬀerent groups depending on the singular sim-
plex. One way to lessen the confusion is to view Sk(X; E) as a subgroup of
the direct sum over every point x ∈X of Sk(X; Ex).
Think of S∗(X; E) as a graded abelian group.
We next describe the
diﬀerential. The formula would be the usual one were it not for the fact
that given any k-simplex, one of its faces does not contain the base point.
We will use the local coeﬃcient system to identify ﬁbers over diﬀerent points
of the simplex to resolve this problem.
Recall there are face maps fk
m : ∆k−1 →∆k deﬁned by
fk
m(t0, t1, · · · , tk−1) = (t0, · · · , tm−1, 0, tm, · · · , tk−1).
Note that fk
m(e0) = e0 if m > 0 but
fk
0 (e0) = fk
0 (1, 0, · · · , 0) = (0, 1, 0, · · · , 0).

104
5. Homology with Local Coeﬃcients
This will make the formulas for the diﬀerential a little bit more complicated
than usual, since this one face map does not preserve base points.
Given a singular simplex σ : ∆k →X, let γσ : [0, 1] →X be the path
σ(t, 1 −t, 0, 0, · · · , 0). Then because p : E →X is a covering space (the ﬁber
is discrete), the path γσ deﬁnes a isomorphism of groups γσ : Eσ(0,1,··· ,0) →
Eσ(1,0,0,··· ,0) via path lifting.
Thus, deﬁne the diﬀerential ∂: Sk(X; E) →Sk−1(X; E) by the formula
aσ →γσ(a)(σ ◦fk
0 ) +
k

m=1
(−1)m a (σ ◦fk
m).
Theorem 5.8. This is a diﬀerential, i.e. ∂2 = 0. Moreover the homology
Hk(S∗(X; E), ∂) equals Hk(X; Aρ), where ρ : π1X →Aut(A) is the homo-
morphism determined by the local coeﬃcient system p : E →X as in Lemma
4.7.
Exercise 81. Prove Theorem 5.8.
The homology of the chain complex (Sk(X; E), ∂) is called the homology
with local coeﬃcients in E. Theorem 5.8 says that this is isomorphic to
the homology with coeﬃcients twisted by ρ. Notice that the deﬁnition of
homology with local coeﬃcients does not involve a choice of base point for X.
It follows from Theorem 5.8 that the homology twisted by a representation
ρ also does not depend on the choice of base point.
Similar constructions apply to cohomology, as we now indicate.
Let
Sk(X; E) be the set of all functions, c, which assign to a singular simplex
σ : ∆k →X an element c(σ) ∈Eσ(e0). Then Sk(X; E) is an abelian group,
and has coboundary operator δ : Sk(X; E) →Sk+1(X; E) deﬁned by
(δc) (σ) = (−1)k

γ−1
σ (c (∂0σ)) +
k+1

i=1
(−1)i c (∂iσ)

Then δ2 = 0 and,
Theorem 5.9. The cohomology of the chain complex (S∗(X; E), δ) equals
the cohomology H∗(X; Aρ), where ρ : π1X →Aut(A) is the homomorphism
determined by the local coeﬃcient system p : E →X.
For the proof see [43].
Here is the example involving orientability of manifolds, presented in
terms of local coeﬃcients instead of the orientation representation. Let M
be an n-dimensional manifold. Deﬁne a local coeﬃcient system E →M, by

5.4. Functoriality
105
setting
E =
 
x∈M
Hn(M, M −{x}).
A basis for the topology of E is given by
V z = {Im [z] ∈Hn(M, M −{x}) | x ∈V }
where V is open in X and z ∈Zn(M, M −V ) is a relative cycle. Then
E →X is a local coeﬃcient system with ﬁbers Hn(M, M −{x}) ∼= Z, called
the orientation sheaf of M. (Note the orientation double cover MO is the
subset of E corresponding to the subset ±1 ∈Z) Then H∗(M; E) can be
identiﬁed with H∗(M; Zw).
5.4. Functoriality
The functorial properties of homology and cohomology with local coeﬃcients
depend on more than just the spaces involved, they also depend on the
coeﬃcient systems.

i aiσi with ai ∈Eσi(e0), the simplices
σi push forward to simplices f ◦σ in X′. Thus one needs a way to assign

coeﬃcients does.
Cohomology with local coeﬃcients is a functor on a slightly diﬀerent

Exercise 82. Give an alternative description of these two functoriality prop-
erties in terms of representations using the algebraic deﬁnition of homology
and cohomology with local coeﬃcients. More precisely, if ρ : π1X →Aut(A)
is a representation deﬁning the homology of X with coeﬃcients in Aρ, and
similarly ρ′ : π1X′ →Aut(A′) deﬁnes the homology of X′ with coeﬃcients
in A′
ρ′, construct a commutative diagram which must exist for the homology
of X with coeﬃcient in ρ to map to the homology of X′ with coeﬃcients in
A′
ρ′. Do the same for cohomology.
A straightforward checking that all the usual constructions continue to
hold with local coeﬃcients proves the following theorem.
Theorem 5.13. Homology with local coeﬃcients forms a homology theory
on L. More precisely, for any object in L there exists a connecting homo-
morphism and a natural long exact sequence. The excision and homotopy
axioms hold.
Similarly cohomology with local coeﬃcients forms a cohomology theory
on the category L∗.
In particular, there is a Mayer-Vietoris sequence for homology with local
coeﬃcients which gives a method for computing. Some care must be taken
in using this theorem because local coeﬃcients do not always extend. For
example, Given a homomorphism ρ : π1(X −U) →Aut(A) and an inclusion
of pairs (X −U, B −U) →(X, B) excision holds (i.e. the inclusion of pairs
induces isomorphisms in homology with local coeﬃcients) only if ρ extends
over π1(X). In particular the morphism of local coeﬃcients must (exist and)
be isomorphisms on ﬁbers.
We end this section with a useful proposition which explicitly describes
the 0th homology and cohomology with local coeﬃcients.
Proposition 5.14. Let B be a path connected CW-complex, π = π1(B) and
V a Zπ-module. then
1. Let Vπ denote the quotient of V by the subgroup generated by the
elements {v −γ · v | v ∈V, γ ∈π1B } (the group Vπ is called the
group of coinvariants). Then
H0(B; V ) ∼= Vπ.

108
5. Homology with Local Coeﬃcients
2. Let V π denote the subgroup of V consisting of elements ﬁxed by π,
i.e. V π = {v ∈V | γ · v = v for all γ ∈π} (the group V π is called
the group of invariants). Then
H0(B; V ) ∼= V π.
Proof. Since B is path connected, up to homotopy we may as well assume
that the 0-skeleton of B consists of a single vertex, and so the 0-cells of
the universal cover ˜B are all of the form τ · γ where τ is a ﬁxed 0-cell and
γ ∈π1B. Thus, any 1-cell σ in ˜B has boundary
∂(σ) = τ · γ1(σ) −τ · γ2(σ)
for some γi(σ) ∈π1B.
Let
Φ : V →H0(B; V ) = H0(C∗( ˜B ⊗Zπ V ))
be deﬁned by
Φ(v) = [τ ⊗v].
The 0-cycles are generated by (τ · γ) ⊗v for γ ∈π1B and v ∈V . Given
an 1-cell σ in ˜B,
∂(σ ⊗v)
=
∂(σ) ⊗v
=
(τ · γ1(σ) −τ · γ2(σ)) ⊗v
=
τ ⊗(γ1(σ) −γ2(σ)) · v
and so
0 = Φ(γ1(σ) · v) −Φ(γ2(σ) · v).
(5.1)
There exists a collection of 1-cells σi, i ∈Λ for ˜B with ∂(σi) = τ · ξi −τ
for a set of generators {ξi} of π1B (just lift each 1-cell of B to a 1-cell of ˜B
starting at τ).
Using Equation (5.1) and writing an arbitrary element of π1B as a word
in the σi, it follows easily that Φ is onto with kernel generated by {v −γ ·
v | v ∈V, γ ∈π1B }.
The proof of the second assertion is similar, and is left as an exercise.

If all the Xi are subsets of a set A and if all the fi’s are inclusions of subspaces
show that the colimit can be taken to X = ∪Xi. The topology is given by
saying U ⊂X is open if and only if U ∩Xi is open for all i. Thus such a

Chapter 6

Coﬁbrations and
Homotopy Groups
The material in this chapter forms the topological foundation for algebraic
topology.
6.1. Compactly generated spaces
Given a map f : X×Y →Z, we would like to topologize the set of continuous
functions C(Y, Z) in such way that f is continuous if and only if the adjoint
˜f : X →C(Y, Z),
˜f(x)(y) = f(x, y)
is continuous. Here are three examples:
1. We would like an action of a topological group G × Z →Z to corre-
spond to a continuous function G →Homeo(Z), where Homeo(Z) is
given the subspace topology inherited from C(Z, Z).
2. We would like a homotopy f : I × Y →Z to correspond to a path
˜f : I →C(Y, Z) of functions.
3. The evaluation map
C(Y, Z) × Y →Z,
(f, y) →f(y)
should be continuous. (Is the evaluation map an adjoint?)
Unfortunately, such a topology on C(Y, Z) is not possible, even for Haus-
dorﬀtopological spaces, unless you bend your point of view. Although many
111

112
6. Fibrations, Coﬁbrations and Homotopy Groups
of the constructions we will give are set-theoretically simple, the issue of how
to appropriately topologize these sets can become a nuisance. The category
of compactly generated spaces is a framework which permits one to make
such constructions without worrying about these technical issues. The ref-
erence for the material in this section is Steenrod’s paper “A convenient
category of topological spaces” [38].
Deﬁnition 6.1. A topological space X is said to be compactly generated if
X is Hausdorﬀand if a subset A ⊂X is closed if and only if A ∩C is closed
for every compact C ⊂X.
Examples of compactly generated spaces include:
1. locally compact Hausdorﬀspaces (e.g. manifolds),
2. metric spaces, and
3. CW-complexes with ﬁnitely many cells in each dimension.
We will use the notation K for the category of compactly generated
spaces. (This is taken as a full subcategory of the category of all topological
spaces, i.e. every continuous function between compactly generated spaces
is a morphism in K.)
Any Hausdorﬀspace can be turned into a compactly generated space by
the following trick.
Deﬁnition 6.2. If X is Hausdorﬀ, let k(X) be the set X with the new
topology deﬁned by declaring a subset A ⊂X to be closed in k(X) if and
only if A ∩C is closed in X for all C ⊂X compact.
Exercise 84. Show that k(X) is compactly generated.
Thus k(X) is the underlying set of X topologized with more (closed and
hence more) open sets than X. This construction deﬁnes a functor
k : T2 →K
from the category T2 of Hausdorﬀspaces to the category K of compactly
generated spaces.
Exercise 85. Show that k is a right adjoint for the inclusion functor i :
K →T2. You will end up having to verify several of the facts below.
6.1.1. Basic facts about compactly generated spaces.
1. If X ∈K, then k(X) = X.
2. If f : X →Y is a function, then k(f) : k(X) →k(Y ) is continuous if
and only if f|C : C →Y is continuous for each compact C ⊂X.
3. Let C(X, Y ) denote the set of continuous functions from X to Y .
Then k∗: C(X, k(Y )) →C(X, Y ) is a bijection if X is in K.

6.1. Compactly generated spaces
113
4. The singular chain complexes of a Hausdorﬀspace Y and the space
k(Y ) are the same.
5. The homotopy groups (see Deﬁnition 6.43) of Y and k(Y ) are the
same.
6. Suppose that X0 ⊂X1 ⊂· · · ⊂Xn ⊂· · · is an expanding sequence of
compactly generated spaces so that Xn is closed in Xn+1. Topologize
the union X = ∪nXn by deﬁning a subset C ⊂X to be closed if
C ∩Xn is closed for each n. Then if X is Hausdorﬀ, it is compactly
generated. In this case every compact subset of X is contained in
some Xn.
6.1.2. Products in K. Unfortunately, the product of compactly generated
spaces need not be compactly generated. However, this causes little concern,
as we now see.
Deﬁnition 6.3. Let X, Y be compactly generated spaces. The categorical
product of X and Y is the space k(X × Y ).
The following useful facts hold about the categorical product.
1. k(X × Y ) is in fact a product in the category K.
2. If X is locally compact and Y is compactly generated, then X × Y =
k(X × Y ).
In particular, I × Y = k(I × Y ).
Thus the notion of
homotopy is unchanged.
From now on, if X and Y are compactly generated, we will denote
k(X × Y ) by X × Y .
6.1.3. Function spaces. The standard way to topologize the set of func-
tions C(X, Y ) is to use the compact-open topology.
Deﬁnition 6.4. If X and Y are compactly generated spaces, let C(X, Y )
denote the set of continuous functions from X to Y , topologized with the
compact-open topology. This topology has as a subbasis sets of the form
U(K, W) = {f ∈C(X, Y )|f(K) ⊂W}
where K is a compact set in X and W an open set in Y .
If Y is a metric space, this is the notion, familiar from complex analysis,
of uniform convergence on compact sets. Unfortunately, even for compactly
generated spaces X and Y , C(X, Y ) need not be compactly generated. We
know how to handle this problem: deﬁne
Map(X, Y ) = k(C(X, Y )).
As a set, Map(X, Y ) is the set of continuous maps from X to Y , but its
topology is slightly diﬀerent from the compact open topology.

114
6. Fibrations, Coﬁbrations and Homotopy Groups
Theorem 6.5 (adjoint theorem). For X, Y , and Z compactly generated,
f(x, y) →˜f(x)(y) gives a homeomorphism
Map((X × Y ), Z) →Map(X, Map(Y, Z))
Thus −× Y and Map(Y, −) are adjoint functors from K to K.
The following useful properties of Map(X, Y ) hold.
1. Let e : Map(X, Y ) × X →Y be the evaluation e(f, x) = f(x). Then
if X, Y ∈K, e is continuous.
2. If X, Y, Z ∈K, then:
(a) Map(X, Y × Z) is homeomorphic to Map(X, Y ) × Map(X, Z),
(b) Composition deﬁnes a continuous map
Map(X, Y ) × Map(Y, Z) →Map(X, Z).
We will also use the notation Map(X, A; Y, B) to denote the subspace of
Map(X, Y ) consisting of those functions f : X →Y which satisfy f(A) ⊂B.
A variant of this notation is Map(X, x0; Y, y0) denoting the subspace of
basepoint preserving functions.
6.1.4. Quotient maps. We discuss yet another convenient property of
compactly generated spaces. For topological spaces, one can give an example
of quotient maps p : W →Y and q : X →Z so that p×q : W ×X →Y ×Z
is not a quotient map. However, one can show the following.
Theorem 6.6.
1. If p : W →Y and q : X →Z are quotient maps, and X and Z are
locally compact Hausdorﬀ, then p × q is a quotient map.
2. If p : W →Y and q : X →Z are quotient maps and all space are
compactly generated, then p × q is a quotient map, provided we use
the categorical product.
From now on, we assume all spaces are compactly generated. If we ever
meet a space which is not compactly generated, we immediately apply k.
Thus, for example, if X and Y are Hausdorﬀspaces, then by our conven-
tion X × Y really means k(k(X) × k(Y )). By this convention, we lose no
information concerning homology and homotopy, but we gain the adjoint
theorem.
6.2. Fibrations
There are two kinds of maps of fundamental importance in algebraic topol-
ogy; ﬁbrations and coﬁbrations. Geometrically, ﬁbrations are more com-
plicated than coﬁbrations. However, your garden variety ﬁbration tends to

6.2. Fibrations
115
be a ﬁber bundle, and ﬁber bundles over paracompact spaces are always
ﬁbrations, so that we have seen many examples so far.
Deﬁnition 6.7. A continuous map p : E →B is a ﬁbration if it has the
homotopy lifting property (HLP); i.e. the problem
Y × {0}
E
Y × I
B
✲
˜g
❄
❄
p
✲
G
p p p p p p p p p p p p✒
˜G
has a solution for every space Y .
In other words, given the continuous maps p, G, ˜g, and the inclusion
Y × {0} →Y × I, the problem is to ﬁnd a continuous map ˜G making the
diagram commute.
Remark. Recall that whenever a commutative diagram is given with one
dotted arrow, we consider it as a problem whose solution is a map which
can be substituted for the dashed arrow to give a commutative diagram.
A covering map is a ﬁbration. In studying covering space theory this
fact is called the covering homotopy theorem. For covering maps the lifting
is unique, but this is not true for an arbitrary ﬁbration.
Exercise 86. Show that the projection to the ﬁrst factor p : B × F →B is
a ﬁbration. Show by example that the liftings need not be unique.
The following theorem of Hurewicz says that if a map is locally a ﬁbra-
tion, then it is so globally.
Theorem 6.8. Let p : E →B be a continuous map. Suppose that B is
paracompact and suppose that there exists an open cover {Uα} of B so that
p : p−1(Uα) →Uα is a ﬁbration for each Uα.
Then p : E →B is a ﬁbration.
Proving this theorem is one of the projects for Chapter 4. The corollary
of most consequence for us is the following.
Corollary 6.9. If p : E →B is a ﬁber bundle over a paracompact space B,
then p is a ﬁbration.
Proof. Exercise 86 says that the projection U ×F →U is a ﬁbration. Since
ﬁber bundles have this local product structure, Theorem 6.8 implies that a
ﬁber bundle is a ﬁbration.

116
6. Fibrations, Coﬁbrations and Homotopy Groups
Exercise 87. Give an example of a ﬁbration which is not a ﬁber bundle.
Maps between ﬁbrations are analogous to (and simpler than) maps of
ﬁber bundles.
Deﬁnition 6.10. If p : E →B and p′ : E′ →B′ are ﬁbrations, then a map
of ﬁbrations is a pair of maps f : B →B′, ˜f : E →E′ so that the diagram
E
E′
B
B′
✲
˜f
❄
❄
✲
f
commutes.
Pullbacks make sense and exist in the world of ﬁbrations.
Deﬁnition 6.11. If p : E →B is a ﬁbration, and f : X →B a continuous
map, deﬁne the pullback of p : E →B by f to be the map f∗(E) →X where
f∗(E) = {(x,e) ∈X × E|f(x) = p(e)} ⊂X × E
and the map f∗(E) →B is the restriction of the projection X × E →X.
The following exercise is a direct consequence of the universal property
of pullbacks.
Exercise 88. Show that f∗(E) →X is a ﬁbration.
The following notation will be in eﬀect for the rest of the book.
If
H : Y × I →B is a homotopy, then Ht : Y →B is the homotopy at time t,
i.e.
Ht(y) = H(y, t).
6.3. The ﬁber of a ﬁbration
A ﬁbration need not be a ﬁber bundle. Indeed, the deﬁnition of a ﬁbration is
less rigid than that of a ﬁber bundle and it is not hard to alter a ﬁber bundle
slightly to get a ﬁbration which is not locally trivial. Nevertheless, a ﬁbration
has a well deﬁned ﬁber up to homotopy. The following theorem asserts this,
and also states that a ﬁbration has a substitute for the structure group
of a ﬁber bundle, namely the group of homotopy classes of self-homotopy
equivalences of the ﬁber.
It is perhaps at ﬁrst surprising that the homotopy lifting property in
itself is suﬃcient to endow a map with the structure of a “ﬁber bundle up
to homotopy”. But as we will see, the notion of a ﬁbration is central in
studying spaces up to homotopy.

6.3. The ﬁber of a ﬁbration
117
Theorem 6.12. Let p : E →B be a ﬁbration. Assume B is path connected.
Then all ﬁbers Eb = p−1(b) are homotopy equivalent. Moreover every
path α : I →B deﬁnes a homotopy class α∗of homotopy equivalences
Eα(0) →Eα(1) which depends only on the homotopy class of α rel endpoints,
in such a way that multiplication of paths corresponds to composition of
homotopy equivalences.
In particular, there exists a well-deﬁned group homomorphism
[α] →(α−1)∗
π1(B, b0) →Homotopy classes of self-homotopy equivalences of Eb0.
Remark. The reason why we use α →(α−1)∗instead of α →α∗is because
by convention, multiplication of paths in B is deﬁned so that αβ means ﬁrst
follow α, then β. This implies that (αβ)∗= β∗◦α∗, and so we use the
inverse to turn this anti-homomorphism into a homomorphism.
Proof. Let b0, b1 ∈B and let α be a path in B from b0 to b1. The inclusion
Eb0 →E completes to a diagram

Notice that the homotopy at time t = 0, H0 : Eb0 →E is just the
inclusion of the ﬁber Eb0 in E. Furthermore, p ◦Ht is the constant map at
α(t), so the homotopy H at time t = 1 is a map H1 : Eb0 →Eb1. We will let
α∗= [ H1] denote the homotopy class of this map. Since H is not unique,
we need to show that another choice of lift gives a homotopic map. We will
in fact show something more general. Suppose α′ : I →B is another path

map Λ : Eb0 × I × I →B such that
Λ(e,s,t) = F(s,t)
where F(s,t) is a homotopy rel end points of α to α′.
(So F0 = α and
F1 = α′.) The solutions H and H′ constructed above give a diagram

But then Λ is a homotopy from H : Eb0 × I →E to H′ : Eb0 × I →E.
Restricting to Eb0 × {1} we obtain a homotopy from H1 to H′
1. Thus the
homotopy class α∗= [ H1] depends only on the homotopy class of α rel end
points, establishing the claim.
Clearly (αβ)∗= β∗◦α∗if β(0) = α(1). In particular, if β = α−1 then
(const)∗= β∗◦α∗, where const denotes the constant path at b0. But clearly
(const)∗= [IdEb0]
Thus β∗is a homotopy inverse of α∗.
This shows that α∗is a homotopy equivalence, and since B is path
connected, all ﬁbers are homotopy equivalent.
Applying this construction to α ∈π1(B,b0) we see that α∗deﬁnes a ho-
motopy equivalence of Eb0, and products of loops correspond to composites
of homotopy equivalences. The following exercise completes the proof.
Exercise 89. Show that the set of homotopy classes of homotopy equiva-
lences of a space X forms a group under composition. That is, show that
multiplication and taking inverses is well deﬁned.
Theorem 6.12 asserts that the ﬁbers p−1(b) = Eb for b ∈B are homotopy
equivalent. Thus we will abuse terminology slightly and refer to any space
in the homotopy equivalence class of the space Eb for any b ∈B as the ﬁber
of the ﬁbration p : E →B.

120
6. Fibrations, Coﬁbrations and Homotopy Groups
Since homotopy equivalences induce isomorphisms in homology or coho-
mology, a ﬁbration with ﬁber F gives rise to local coeﬃcients systems whose
ﬁber is the homology or cohomology of F, as the next corollary asserts.
Corollary 6.13. Let p : E →B be a ﬁbration and let F = p−1(b0).
Then p gives rise to local coeﬃcient systems over B with ﬁber Hn(F; M) or
Hn(F; M) for any n and any coeﬃcient group M. These local coeﬃcients
are obtained from the representations via the composite homomorphism
π1(B,b0) →
 Homotopy classes of self-homotopy
equivalences F →F
	
→Aut(A)
where A = Hn(F; M) or A = Hn(F; M).
Proof. The maps f∗: Hn(F; M) →Hn(F;M) and f∗: Hn(F; M) →
Hn(F; M) induced by a homotopy equivalence f : F →F are isomorphisms
which depend only on the homotopy class of f. Thus there is a function
from the group of homotopy classes of homotopy equivalences of F to the
group of automorphisms of A. This is easily seen to be a homomorphism.
The corollary follows.
We see that a ﬁbration gives rise to many local coeﬃcient systems, by
taking homology or cohomology of the ﬁber. More generally one obtains a
local coeﬃcient system given any homotopy functor from spaces to abelian
groups (or R-modules), such as the generalized homology theories which we
introduce in Chapter 8.
With some extra hypotheses one can also apply this to homotopy func-
tors on the category of based spaces. For example, we will see below that if
F is simply connected, or more generally “simple,” then taking homotopy
groups πnF also gives rise to a local coeﬃcient system. For now however,
observe that the homotopy equivalences constructed by Theorem 6.12 need
not preserve base points.
6.4. Path space ﬁbrations
An important family of ﬁbrations are the path space ﬁbrations. They will
be useful in replacing arbitrary maps by ﬁbrations and then in extending a
ﬁbration to a “ﬁber sequence”.
Deﬁnition 6.14. Let (Y, y0) be a based space. The path space Py0Y is the
space of paths in Y starting at y0, i.e.
Py0Y = Map(I,0; Y ,y0) ⊂Map(I,Y ),

6.4. Path space ﬁbrations
121
topologized as in the previous subsection, i.e.
as a compactly generated
space. The loop space Ωy0Y is the space of all loops in Y based at y0, i.e.
Ωy0Y = Map(I,{0,1}; Y ,{y0}).
Often the subscript y0 is omitted in the above notation.
Let Y I =
Map(I, Y ). This is called the free path space.
Let p : Y I →Y be the
evaluation at the end point of a path: p(α) = α(1).
By our conventions on topologies, p : Y I →Y is continuous.
The
restriction of p to Py0Y is also continuous.
Exercise 90. Let y0, y1 be two points in a path-connected space Y . Prove
that Ωy0Y and Ωy1Y are homotopy equivalent.
Theorem 6.15.
1. The map p : Y I →Y , where p(α) = α(1), is a ﬁbration. Its ﬁber
over y0 is the space of paths which end at y0, a space homeomorphic
to Py0Y .
2. The map p : Py0Y →Y is a ﬁbration. Its ﬁber over y0 is the loop
space Ωy0Y .
3. The free path space Y I is homotopy equivalent to Y . The projection
p : Y I →Y is a homotopy equivalence.
4. The space of paths in Y starting at y0, Py0Y , is contractible.
Proof. 1. Let A be a space, and suppose a homotopy lifting problem

is given. We write g(a) instead of g(a, 0). For each a ∈A, g(a) is a path
in Y which ends at p(g(a)) = H(a, 0). This point is the start of the path
H(a, −).
H(a, 0)
g(a)
H(a, −)

122
6. Fibrations, Coﬁbrations and Homotopy Groups
We will deﬁne H(a, s)(t) to be a path running along the path g(a) and
then part way along H(a, −), ending at H(a, s).
H(a, s)(−)
g(a)
H(a, −)

H(a, s)(t) =

g(a)((1 + s)t)
if 0 ≤t ≤1/(1 + s),
H(a, ((1 + s)t −1)
if 1/(1 + s) ≤t ≤1.
Then H(a, s)(t) is continuous as a function of (a, s, t), so H(a,s) ∈Y I and by
our choice of topologies H : A × I →Y I is continuous. Also H(a,0) = g(a)
and p( H(a, s)) = H(a, s)(1) = H(a, s). Thus the lifting problem is solved
and so p : Py0Y →Y is a ﬁbration. The ﬁber p−1(y0) consists of all paths
ending at y0 and the path space Py0Y consists of all paths starting at y0. A
homeomorphism is given by
α(t) →α(t) = α(1 −t).
This proves 1.
2. has the same proof; the fact that g(a) starts at y0 means that H(a, s)
also starts at y0.
3. Let i : Y →Y I be the map taking y to the constant path at y. Then
p ◦i = IdY . Let F : Y I × I →Y I be given by
F(α,s)(t) = α(s + t −st).
Then F(α,0) = α and F(α, 1) is the constant path at α(1) which in turn
equals i ◦p(α). Thus F shows that the identity is homotopic to i ◦p. Hence
p and i are homotopy inverses.
4. has the same proof as 3.

and H1 = IdE. Similarly for ˜f ◦˜g). One says that ˜f and ˜g are ﬁber homotopy
equivalences.
Notice that a ﬁber homotopy equivalence ˜f : E →E′ induces a homo-

6.6. Replacing a map by a ﬁbration
Let f : X →Y be a continuous map. We will replace X by a homotopy
equivalent space Pf and obtain a map Pf →Y which is a ﬁbration. In short,
every map is equivalent to a ﬁbration. If f is a ﬁbration to begin with, then
the construction gives a ﬁber homotopy equivalent ﬁbration. We assume
that Y is path-connected and X is non-empty.
Let q : Y I →Y be the path space ﬁbration, with q(α) = α(0); evaluation
at the starting point.

An element of Pf is a pair (x, α) where α is a path in Y and x is a point in
X which maps via f to the starting point of α.
The mapping path ﬁbration
p : Pf →Y
is obtaining by evaluating at the end point
p(x, α) = α(1).

2. The map p : Pf →Y is a ﬁbration.
3. If f : X →Y is a ﬁbration, then h is a ﬁber homotopy equivalence.
Proof. 1. Let h : X →Pf be the map
h(x) = (x, constf(x))
where constf(x) means the constant path at f(x). Then f = p ◦h, so the
triangle commutes. The homotopy inverse of h is p1 : Pf →X, projection
on the X-component. Then p1 ◦h = IdX. The homotopy from h◦p1 to IdPf
is given by
F((x, α), s) = (x, αs),
where αs is the path s →α(st) (We have embedded X in Pf via h, and have
given a deformation retract of Pf to X by contracting a path to its starting
point.)

an X-component and a Y I-component and we write
g(a) = (g1(a), g2(a)) ∈Pf ⊂X × Y I.
Note that since g(a) is in the pullback, g1(a) maps via f to the starting
point of the path g2(a) and the square above commutes, so the endpoint of
the path g2(a) is the starting point of the path H(a, −). Here is a picture
of g(a) and H(a, −).
g1(a)

The lift H will have two components. The X-component will be constant
in s,
H1(a, s) = g1(a)
The Y I-component of the lift will be a path running along the path g2(a)
and then part way along H(a, −), ending at H(a, s).
Here is a picture of H(a, s).

where

H2(a, s)(t) =

g2(a)((1 + s)t)
if 0 ≤t ≤1/(1 + s),
H(a, ((1 + s)t −1)
if 1/(1 + s) ≤t ≤1.
We leave it to the reader to check H is continuous and that it is a lift of H
extending the map g. Thus we have shown the mapping path ﬁbration is a
ﬁbration.
3. Finally suppose that f : X →Y is itself a ﬁbration. In the proof of
1. we showed that
h : X →Pf,
h(x) = (x, constf(x))
and
p1 : Pf →X
p1(x,α) = x
are homotopy inverses. Note h is a map of ﬁbrations (covering the identity),
but p1 is not, since f ◦p1(x, α) is the starting point of α and p(x, α) is the
endpoint of α.
Let γ : Pf × I →Y be the map γ(x,α,t) = α(t). Since f is a ﬁbration,

Thus h and g are maps of ﬁbrations, and in fact homotopy inverses since
g is homotopic to p1. But this is not enough.
To ﬁnish the proof, we need to show that g ◦h is homotopic to IdX by
a vertical homotopy (i.e. a homotopy over the identity IdY : Y →Y ) and
h ◦g is homotopic to IdPf by a vertical homotopy.

6.7. Coﬁbrations
127
Let F : X × I →X be the map
F(x,t) = ˜γ(x,constf(x),t).
Then
1. F(x,0) = ˜γ(x,constf(x),0) = p1(x,constf(x)) = x, and
2. F(x,1) = ˜γ(x,constf(x),1) = g ◦h(x).
Hence F is a homotopy from IdX to g ◦h. Moreover,
f(F(x,t)) = f(˜γ(x,constf(x),t)) = γ(x,constf(x),t) = f(x)
so F is a vertical homotopy.
Here is a picture of ˜γ
g(x)

The vertical homotopy from IdPf to h ◦g is given by contracting along
paths to their endpoints. Explicitly H : Pf × I →Pf is
H(x, α, s) = (˜γ(x, α, s), (t →α(s + t −st))).
Given a map f : X →Y , it is common to be sloppy and say “F is the
ﬁber of f”, or “F →X →Y is a ﬁbration” to mean that after replacing
X by the homotopy equivalent space Pf and the map f by the ﬁbration
Pf →Y , the ﬁber is a space of the homotopy type of F.

Coﬁbration is a “dual” notion to ﬁbration, using the adjointness of the

For “reasonable” spaces, any coﬁbration i : A →X can be shown to
be an embedding whose image is closed in X. We will only deal with coﬁ-

Deﬁnition 6.20. Let X be compactly generated, A ⊂X a subspace. Then
(X,A) is called an NDR–pair (NDR stands for “neighborhood deformation
retract”) if there exist continuous maps u : X →I and h : X × I →X so
that:

1. A = u−1(0),
2. h(−, 0) = IdX,
3. h(a, t) = a for all t ∈I, a ∈A, and
4. h(x, 1) ∈A for all x ∈X such that u(x) < 1.
In particular the neighborhood U = {x ∈X|u(x) < 1} of A deformation
retracts to A.
Deﬁnition 6.21. A pair (X,A) is called a a DR–pair (DR stands for “de-
formation retract”) if 1,2,3 hold, but also
4′ h(x, 1) ∈A
for all x ∈X.
(This is slightly stronger than the usual deﬁnition of deformation retracts,
because of the requirement that there exists a function u : X →I such that
u−1(0) = A.)
Theorem 6.22 (Steenrod). Equivalent are:
1. (X,A) is an NDR pair.
2. (X × I, X × 0 ∪A × I) is a DR pair.
3. X × 0 ∪A × I is a retract of X × I.
4. i : A →X is a coﬁbration.
For a complete proof see Steenrod’s paper [38].

We next establish that a pushout of a coﬁbration is a coﬁbration; this
is dual to the fact that pullback of a ﬁbration is a ﬁbration. The word dual
here is used in the sense of reversing arrows.

Pushouts are unique up to homeomorphism; this is proved using an
“initial object” argument. Sometimes we just say D is the pushout, and
sometimes we write D = f∗C, the pushout of g along f.
Pushouts always exist. They are constructed as follows.
When A is empty the pushout is the disjoint union B ⨿C. A concrete
realization is given by choosing base points b0 ∈B and c0 ∈C and setting
B⨿C = {(b, c0, 0) ∈B × C × I | b ∈B} ∪{(b0, c, 1) ∈B × C × I | c ∈C}.
In general, a concrete realization for the pushout of f : A →B and
g : A →C is
B ⨿C
f(a) ∼g(a).
Note that this is a quotient of a sum, just like the pushout in the category
of abelian groups.

Exercise 92. Prove Theorem 6.25.
6.8. Replacing a map by a coﬁbration
Let f : A →X be a continuous map. We will replace X by a homotopy
equivalent space Mf and obtain a map A →Mf which is a coﬁbration. In
short, every map is equivalent to a coﬁbration. If f is a coﬁbration to begin
with, then the construction gives a homotopy equivalent coﬁbration relative
to A.
Deﬁnition 6.26. The mapping cylinder of a map f : A →X is the space

The “dual” result to Theorem 6.18 is the following.
Theorem 6.27. Let f : A →X be a map. Let i : A →Mf be the inclusion
i(a) = [a, 0].
1. There exists a homotopy equivalence h : Mf →X so that the diagram

2. The inclusion i : A →Mf is a coﬁbration.
3. If f : A →X is a coﬁbration, then h is a homotopy equivalence
rel A, in particular h induces a homotopy equivalence of the coﬁbers
Cf →X/f(A).
Proof. 1. Let h : Mf →X be the map
h[a, s] = f(a),
h[x] = x.
Then f = h ◦i so the diagram commutes. The homotopy inverse of h is the
inclusion j : X →Mf. In fact, h ◦j = IdX, and the homotopy from IdMf
to j ◦h squashes the mapping cylinder onto X and is given by
F([a, s], t) = [a, s + t −st]
F([x], t) = [x].
2. By the implication (3 ⇒4) from Steenrod’s theorem (Theorem 6.22),
we need to construct a retraction

3 sides and then contract a side to a point.) Deﬁne R([a, s], t) = [a, r(s, t)]
and R([x], t) = ([x], 0). Thus i : A →Mf is a coﬁbration.
3.
If f : A →X is a coﬁbration, by Steenrod’s theorem there is a
retraction
r : X × I →X × 1 ∪f(A) × I
and an obvious homeomorphism
q : X × 1 ∪f(A) × I →Mf.
Deﬁne g : X →Mf by g(x) = q(r(x, 0)). We will show that g and h are
homotopy inverses rel A (recall h[a, s] = f(a) and h[x] = x).
Deﬁne the homotopy
H : X × I →X
as H = h ◦r. Then H(x, 0) = h ◦g(x), H(x, 1) = x, and H(f(a), t) = f(a).
Deﬁne the homotopy
F : Mf × I →Mf
by F([x], t) = q(r(x, t)) and F([a, s], t) = q(r(f(a), st)). Then F(x, 0) =
g ◦h(x), H(−, 1) = IdMf , and F(i(a), t) = i(a). The reader is encouraged
to verify these formulae, or to draw the motivating pictures.
6.9. Sets of homotopy classes of maps
We introduce the following notation. If X, Y are spaces, then [X,Y ] denotes
the set of homotopy classes of maps from X to Y , i.e.
[X,Y ] = Map(X,Y )/ ∼
where f ∼g if f is homotopic to g.
Notice that if Y is path-connected, then the set [X,Y ] contains a distin-
guished class of maps, namely the unique class containing all the constant
maps. We will use this as a base point for [X,Y ] if one is needed.
If X has a base point x0, and Y has a base point y0, let [X,Y ]0 denote
the based homotopy classes of based maps, where a based map is a map
f : (X,x0) →(Y ,y0). Then [X,Y ]0 has a distinguished class, namely the
class of the constant map at y0. (In the based context, it is not necessary to
assume Y is path-connected to have this distinguished class.) Given a map
f : X →Y let [f] denote its homotopy class in [X, Y ] or [X, Y ]0. Notice
that if X and Y are based spaces there is a forgetful map [X, Y ]0 →[X, Y ].
This map need not be injective or surjective.
The notion of an exact sequence of sets is a useful generalization of the
corresponding concept for groups.

6.9. Sets of homotopy classes of maps

Deﬁnition 6.28. A sequence of functions
A
f−→B
g−→C
of sets (not spaces or groups) with base points is called exact at B if
f(A) = g−1(c0)
where c0 is the base point of C.
All that was necessary here was that C be based. Notice that if A, B, C
are groups, with basepoints the identity element, and f, g homomorphisms,
then A →B →C is exact as a sequence of sets if and only if it is exact as
a sequence of groups.
The following two theorems form the cornerstone of constructions of
exact sequences in algebraic topology.
Theorem 6.29 (basic property of ﬁbrations). Let p : E →B be a ﬁbra-
tion, with ﬁber F = p−1(b0) and B path-connected. Let Y be any space.
Then the sequence of sets
[Y ,F]
i∗
−→[Y ,E]
p∗
−→[Y ,B]
is exact.
Proof. Clearly p∗(i∗[g]) = 0.
Suppose f : Y →E so that p∗[f] = [const], i.e.
p ◦f : Y →B is
null homotopic.
Let G : Y × I →B be a null homotopy, and then let
H : Y × I →E be a solution to the lifting problem

Since p ◦H(y,1) = G(y,1) = b0, H(y,1) ∈F = p−1(b0).
Thus f is
homotopic into the ﬁber, so [f] = i∗[H(−,1)].
Theorem 6.30 (basic property of coﬁbrations). Let i : A →X be a coﬁ-
bration, with coﬁber X/A. Let q : X →X/A denote the quotient map. Let
Y be any path-connected space. Then the sequence of sets

spaces with a non-degenerate base point, i.e.
(X,x0) is an object of K∗
if the inclusion {x0} ⊂X is a coﬁbration. The morphisms in K∗are the
base point preserving continuous maps.
Exercise 93. Prove the base-point versions of the previous two theorems:
1. If F →E →B is a base point preserving ﬁbration, then for any
Y ∈K∗
[Y ,F]0 →[Y ,E]0 →[Y ,B]0
is exact.
2. If A →X →X/A is a base point preserving coﬁbration, then for any
Y ∈K∗
[X/A,Y ]0 →[X,Y ]0 →[A,Y ]0
is exact.
Most exact sequences in algebraic topology can be derived from Theo-
rems 6.29, 6.30, and Exercise 93. We will soon use this exercise to establish
exact sequences of homotopy groups. To do so, we need to be careful about
base points and adjoints. Recall that if (X, x0) and (Y, y0) are based spaces,

6.10. Adjoint of loops and suspension; smash products
137
then Map(X, Y )0 is the set of maps of pairs (X, x0) →(Y, y0) with the
compactly generated topology.
Deﬁnition 6.32. The smash product of based spaces is
X ∧Y = X × Y
X ∨Y =
X × Y
X × {y0} ∪{x0} ∪Y .
Note that the smash product X∧Y is a based space. Contrary to popular
belief, the smash product is not the product in the category K∗, although
the wedge product
X ∨Y = (X × {y0}) ∪({x0} × Y ) ⊂X × Y
is the sum in K∗. The smash product is the adjoint of the based mapping
space. The following theorem follows from the unbased version of the adjoint
theorem (Theorem 6.5), upon restricting to based maps.
Theorem 6.33 (adjoint theorem). There is a (natural) homeomorphism
Map(X ∧Y, Z)0 ∼= Map(X, Map(Y, Z)0)0
Deﬁnition 6.34. The (reduced) suspension of a based space (X, x0) is SX =
S1 ∧X. The (reduced) cone is CX = I ∧X. Here the circle is based by
1 ∈S1 ⊂C and the interval by 0 ∈I.
Using the usual identiﬁcation I/{0, 1} = S1 via t →e2πit, one sees
SX =
X × I
X × {0, 1} ∪{x0} × I
In other words, if ΣX is the unreduced suspension and cone(X) is the unre-
duced cone (= ΣX/X × {0}), then there are quotient maps
ΣX →SX
cone(X) →CX
given by identifying {x0} × I shaded in the following ﬁgure.

Notice that taking reduced suspensions and reduced cones is functo-
rial. Reduced suspensions and cones are more useful than the unreduced
variety since they have canonical base points and satisfy adjoint proper-
ties. Nonetheless, it is reassuring to connect them with the more familiar
unreduced versions.
Exercise 94. If X ∈K∗(i.e. the inclusion {x0} →X is a coﬁbration),
then the quotient maps ΣX →SX and cone(X) →CX are homotopy
equivalences.
Proposition 6.35. The reduced suspension SSn is homeomorphic to Sn+1
and the reduced cone CSn is homeomorphic to Dn+1.
Exercise 95. Prove Proposition 6.35. This shows in a special case that the
smash product is associative. Prove associativity of the smash product in
general.
Corollary 6.36. Si ∧Sj is homeomorphic to Si+j.
We deﬁned loop spaces by Ωx0X = Map(I, {0, 1}; X, {x0}), but by using
the identiﬁcation of the circle as a quotient space of the interval, one sees
Ωx0X = Map(S1, X)0
Then a special case of Theorem 6.33 shows the following.
Theorem 6.37 (loops and suspension are adjoints). The spaces
Map(SX, Y )0
and
Map(X, ΩY )0
are naturally homeomorphic.

6.11. Fibration and coﬁbration sequences
We will see eventually that the homotopy type of a ﬁber of a ﬁbration mea-
sures how far the ﬁbration is from being a homotopy equivalence.
(For
example, if the ﬁber is contractible then the ﬁbration is a homotopy equiv-
alence.) More generally given a map f : X →Y , one can turn it into a
ﬁbration Pf →Y as above; the ﬁber of this ﬁbration measures how far f is
from a homotopy equivalence.
After turning f : X →Y into a ﬁbration Pf →Y one then has an
inclusion of the ﬁber F ⊂Pf. Why not turn this into a ﬁbration and see
what happens? Now take the ﬁber of the resulting ﬁbration and continue
the process . . .
Similar comments apply to coﬁbrations. Theorem 6.39 below identiﬁes
the resulting iterated ﬁbers and coﬁbers. We ﬁrst introduce some terminol-
ogy.
Deﬁnition 6.38. If f : X →Y is a map, the homotopy ﬁber of f is the
ﬁber of the ﬁbration obtained by turning f into a ﬁbrations. The homotopy
ﬁber is a space, well-deﬁned up to homotopy equivalence. Usually one is
lazy and just calls this the ﬁber of f.
Similarly, the homotopy coﬁber of f : X →Y is the mapping cone Cf,
the coﬁber of X →Mf.
Theorem 6.39.
1. Let F →E →B be a ﬁbration.
Let Z be the homotopy ﬁber of
F →E, so Z →F →E is a ﬁbration (up to homotopy). Then Z is
homotopy equivalent to the loop space ΩB.
2. Let A →X →X/A be a coﬁbration sequence. Let W be the homotopy
coﬁber of X →X/A, so that X →X/A →W is a coﬁbration (up
to homotopy). Then W is homotopy equivalent to the (unreduced)
suspension ΣA.
Proof. 1. Let f : E →B be a ﬁbration with ﬁber F = f−1(b0). Choose
a base point e0 ∈F. In Section 6.6 we constructed a ﬁbration p : Pf →B
with
Pf = {(e,α) ∈E × BI|f(e) = α(0)}
and p(e,α) = α(1), and such that the map h : E →Pf given by h(e) =
(e, constf(e)) is a ﬁber homotopy equivalence.
Let (Pf)0 = p−1(b0), so (Pf)0 →Pf
p−→B is a ﬁbration equivalent to
F →E
f−→B.

6. Fibrations, Coﬁbrations and Homotopy Groups

Clearly π−1(e0) = {(e0,α)|α(0) = α(1) = b0} is homeo-
morphic to the loop space, so we just need to show π is a ﬁbration. Given

2. The map X →X/A is equivalent to X →Ci = X ∪cone(A) where
i : A →X. The following picture makes clear that Ci/X = ΣA. The fact
that X →Ci is a coﬁbration is left as an exercise.

We have introduced the notion of the loop space ΩX of a based space
X as the space of paths in X which start and end at the base point. The
loop space is itself a based space with base point the constant loop at the
base point of X. Let ΩnX denote the n-fold loop space of X. Similarly the
reduced suspension SX of X is a based space. Let SnX denote the n-fold
suspension of X.

142
6. Fibrations, Coﬁbrations and Homotopy Groups
The previous theorem can be restated in the following convenient form.
Theorem 6.40.
1. Let A →X be a coﬁbration. Then any two consecutive maps in the
sequence
A →X →X/A →ΣA →ΣX →· · · →ΣnA →ΣnX →Σn(X/A) →· · ·
have the homotopy type of a coﬁbration followed by projection onto
the coﬁber.
1′. Let A →X be a base point preserving coﬁbration. Then any two
consecutive maps in the sequence
A →X →X/A →SA →SX →· · · →SnA →SnX →Sn(X/A) →· · ·
have the homotopy type of a coﬁbration followed by projection onto
the coﬁber.
2. Let E →B be a ﬁbration with ﬁber F. Then any two consecutive
maps in the sequence
· · · →ΩnF →ΩnE →ΩnB →· · · →ΩF →ΩE →ΩB →F →E →B
have the homotopy type of a ﬁbration preceded by the inclusion of its
ﬁber.
To prove 1′., one must use reduced mapping cylinders and reduced cones.
6.12. Puppe sequences
Lemma 6.41. Let X and Y be spaces in K∗.
1. [X,ΩY ]0 = [SX,Y ]0 is a group.
2. [X,Ω(ΩY )]0 = [SX, ΩY ]0 = [S2X, Y ]0 is an abelian group.
Sketch of proof. The equalities follow from Theorem 6.37, the adjointness
of loops and suspension. The multiplication can be looked at in two ways:
ﬁrst on [SX, Y ]0 as coming from the map
ν : SX →SX ∨SX
given by collapsing out the “equator” X × 1/2. Then deﬁne
fg :=
def ν(f ∨g)

The second interpretation of multiplication is on [X, ΩY ]0 and comes from
composition of loops

with (fg)x = f(x) ∗g(x).
The proof of 2 is obtained by meditating on the following sequence of
pictures.

Exercise 97. Convince yourself that the two deﬁnitions of multiplication
on [X,ΩY ]0 = [SX,Y ]0 are the same and that π1(Y, y0) = [SS0, Y ]0.
The last lemma sits in a more general context. A loop space is a example
of an H-group and a suspension is an example of a co-H-group. See [36] or
[43] for precise deﬁnitions, but here is the basic idea. An H-group Z is a
based space with a “multiplication” map µ : Z × Z →Z and an “inversion”
map ϕ : X →X which satisfy the axioms of a group up to homotopy (e.g.
is associative up to homotopy). For a topological group G and any space
X, Map(X, G) is a group, similarly for an H-group Z, [X, Z]0 is a group.
To deﬁne a co-H-group, one reverses all the arrows in the deﬁnition of H-
group, so there is a co-multiplication ν : W →W ∨W and a co-inversion

144
6. Fibrations, Coﬁbrations and Homotopy Groups
ψ : W →W.
Then [W, X]0 is a group.
Finally, there is a formal, but
occasionally very useful result. If W is a co-H-group and Z is an H-group,
then the two multiplications on [W, Z]0 agree and are abelian. Nifty, huh?
One consequence of this is that π1(X, x0) of an H-group (e.g. a topological
group) is abelian.
Combining Lemma 6.41 with Theorem 6.40 and Exercise 93 yields the
proof of the following fundamental theorem.
Theorem 6.42 (Puppe sequences). Let Y ∈K∗.
1. If F →E →B is a ﬁbration, the following sequence is a long exact
sequence of sets (i ≥0), groups (i ≥1), and abelian groups (i ≥2).
· · · →[Y ,ΩiF]0 →[Y ,ΩiE]0 →[Y ,ΩiB]0 →
· · · →[Y ,ΩB]0 →[Y ,F]0 →[Y ,E]0 →[Y ,B]0
where ΩiZ denotes the iterated loop space
Ω(Ω(· · · (ΩZ) · · · ).
2. If (X,A) is an coﬁbration, the following sequence is a long exact se-
quence of sets (i ≥0), groups (i ≥1), and abelian groups (i ≥2).
· · · →[Si(X/A), Y ]0 →[SiX, Y ]0 →[SiA, Y ]0 →
· · · →[SA, Y ]0 →[X/A, Y ]0 →[X, Y ]0 →[A, Y ]0
This theorem is used as the basic tool for constructing exact sequences
in algebraic topology.
6.13. Homotopy groups
We now deﬁne the homotopy groups of a based space.
Deﬁnition 6.43. Suppose that X is a space with base point x0. Then the
nth homotopy group of X based at x0 is the group (set if n = 0, abelian
group if n ≥2)
πn(X, x0) = [Sn, X]0.
(We will usually only consider X ∈K∗.)
Notice that
πn(X, x0) = [Sn, X]0 = [Sk ∧Sn−k, X]0 = πn−k(Ωk(X)).
(6.2)
In particular,
πnX = π1(Ωn−1X).

6.13. Homotopy groups
145
There are other ways of looking at homotopy groups which are useful.
For example, to get a hold of the group structure for writing down a proof,
use πn(X, x0) = [(In, ∂In), (X, x0)]. For the proof of the exact sequence of
a pair (coming later) use πn(X, x0) = [(Dn, Sn−1), (X, x0)]. For ﬁnding a
geometric interpretation of the boundary map in the homotopy long exact
sequence of a ﬁbration given below, use
πn(X, x0) = [(Sn−1 × I, (Sn−1 × ∂I) ∪(∗× I)), (X, x0)].
A useful observation is that the set π0(X, x0) is in bijective correspon-
dence with the path components of X. A based map f : S0 = {±1} →X
corresponds to the path component of f(−1). In general π0 is just a based
set, unless X is an H-space, e.g. a loop space or a topological group.
Also useful is the fact that [X, Y ]0 = π0(Map(X, Y )0), the set of path
components of the function space Map(X, Y )0. In particular, Equation (6.2)
shows that πn(X, x0) is the set of path components of the n-fold loop space
of X.
Homotopy groups are the most fundamental invariant of algebraic topol-
ogy. For example, we will see below that a CW-complex is contractible if
and only if all its homotopy groups vanish. More generally we will see that
a map f : X →Y is a homotopy equivalence if and only if it induces an
isomorphism on all homotopy groups. Finally, the homotopy type of a CW-
complex X is determined by the homotopy groups of X together with a
cohomological recipe (the k-invariants) for assembling these groups. (The
homotopy groups by themselves do not usually determine the homotopy
type of a space.)
Exercise 98. Show that πn(X × Y ) = πn(X) ⊕πn(Y ).
As an application of the Puppe sequences (Theorem 6.42) we imme-
diately get the extremely useful long exact sequence of homotopy groups
associated to any ﬁbration.
Corollary 6.44 (long exact sequence of a ﬁbration). Let F →E →B be
a ﬁbration. Then the sequence
· · · →πnF →πnE →πnB →πn−1F →πn−1E →· · ·
→π1F →π1E →π1B →π0F →π0E →π0B
is exact.
In Corollary 6.44, one must be careful with exactness at the right end
of this sequence since π1F, π1E, and π1B are non-abelian groups and π0F,
π0E, and π0B are merely sets.
Taking F discrete in Corollary 6.44 and using the fact that covering
spaces are ﬁbrations one concludes the following important theorem.

146
6. Fibrations, Coﬁbrations and Homotopy Groups
Theorem 6.45. Let ˜X →X be a connected covering space of a connected
space X. Then the induced map
πn( ˜X) →πn(X)
is injective if n = 1, and an isomorphism if n > 1.
Exercise 99. Give a covering space proof of Theorem 6.45.
6.14. Examples of ﬁbrations
Many examples of ﬁbrations and ﬁber bundles arise naturally in mathemat-
ics. Getting a feel for this material requires getting one’s hands dirty. For
that reason many facts are left as exercises. We will use the following theo-
rem from equivariant topology to conclude that certain maps are ﬁbrations.
This is a special case of Theorem 4.5.
Theorem 6.46 (Gleason). Let G be a compact Lie group acting freely on
a compact manifold X. Then
X →X/G
is a principal ﬁber bundle with ﬁber G.
6.14.1. Hopf ﬁbrations. The ﬁrst class of examples we give are the fa-
mous Hopf ﬁbrations. These were invented by Hopf to prove that there are
non–nullhomotopic maps Sn →Sm when n > m.
There are four Hopf ﬁbrations (these are ﬁber bundles):
S0 →S1 →S1
S1 →S3 →S2
S3 →S7 →S4
and
S7 →S15 →S8.
These are constructed by looking at the various division algebras over R.
Let K = R, C, H, or O
(the real numbers, complex numbers, quater-
nions, and octonions). Each of these has a norm N : K →R+ so that
N(xy) = N(x)N(y)
and N(x) > 0 for x ̸= 0.
More precisely,
1. If K = R, then N(x) = |x| =
√
xx where x = x,
2. If K = C, then N(x) =
√
xx where a + ib = a −ib,
3. If K = H, then N(x) =
√
xx, where a + ib + jc + kd = a−ib−jc−kd,

6.14. Examples of ﬁbrations
147
4. The octonions are deﬁned to be O = H ⊕H. The conjugation is
deﬁned by the rule: if p = (a, b), then p = (a, −b). Multiplication is
given by the rule
(a, b)(c, d) = (ac −db, bc + da)
and the norm is deﬁned by
N(p) =
'
pp.
Let EK = {(x, y) ∈K ⊕K|N(x)2 + N(y)2 = 1}.
Let GK = {x ∈
K|N(x) = 1}.
Exercise 100. GK is a compact Lie group homeomorphic to Sr for r =
0, 1, 3.
For K = O, GK is homeomorphic to S7, but it is not a group;
associativity fails.
Let GK act on EK by g · (x, y) = (gx, gy) (Note N(gx)2 + N(gy)2 =
N(x)2 + N(y)2 if N(g) = 1.)
This action is free. This is easy to show for K = R, C, or H, since
K is associative, hence if g(x, y) = (x, y), one of x or y is non-zero (since
N(x) and N(y) are not both zero) and so if x ̸= 0, gx = x implies that
1 = xx−1 = (gx)x−1 = g(xx−1) = g. This argument does not work for
K = O since GK is not a group; in this case one deﬁnes an equivalence
relation on EK by (x, y) ∼(gx, gy) for g ∈GK. The resulting quotient map
EK →Ek/ ∼is a ﬁber bundle.
It is also easy to see that EK consists of the unit vectors in the corre-
sponding Rn and so EK = S2r+1 for r = 0, 1, 3, 7. Moreover GK ∼= Sr and
so the ﬁber bundle GK →EK →EK/GK can be rewritten
Sr →S2r+1 →Y = S2r+1/Sr
Exercise 101. Prove that Y is homeomorphic to the (r+1)-sphere Sr+1 in
the 4 cases. In fact, prove that the quotient map S2r+1 →Y can be written
in the form f : S2r+1 →Sr+1 where
f(z1, z2) = (2z1z2, N(z1)2 −N(z2)2).
Using these ﬁbrations and the long exact sequence of a ﬁbration (Corol-
lary 6.44) one obtains exact sequences
· · · →πnS1 →πnS3 →πnS2 →πn−1S1 →· · ·
· · · →πnS3 →πnS7 →πnS4 →πn−1S3 →· · ·
· · · →πnS7 →πnS15 →πnS8 →πn−1S7 →· · ·
Since πnS1 = 0 for n > 1 (the universal cover of S1 is contractible and
so this follows from Theorem 6.45), it follows from the ﬁrst sequence that

148
6. Fibrations, Coﬁbrations and Homotopy Groups
πnS3 = πnS2 for n > 2. The Hopf degree Theorem (Corollary 6.67 and a
project for Chapter 3) implies that πnSn = Z. In particular,
π3S2 = Z.
This is our second non-trivial calculation of πmSn (the ﬁrst being πnSn = Z).
The quickest way to to obtain information from the other sequences is to
use the cellular approximation theorem. This is an analogue of the simplicial
approximation theorem. Its proof is one of the projects for Chapter 1.
Theorem 6.47 (cellular approximation theorem). Let (X, A) and (Y, B) be
relative CW-complexes, and let f : (X, A) →(Y, B) be a continuous map.
Then f is homotopic rel A to a cellular map.
Applying this theorem with (X, A) = (Sn, x0) and (Y, B) = (Sm, y0) one
concludes that
πnSm = 0 if n < m.
Returning to the other exact sequences, it follows from the cellular ap-
proximation theorem that πnS4 = πn−1S3 for n ≤6 (since πn(S7) = 0 for
n ≤6), and that πnS8 = πn−1S7 for n ≤14. We will eventually be able to
say more.
6.14.2. Projective spaces. The Hopf ﬁbrations can be generalized by
taking GK acting on Kn for n > 2 at least for K = R, C, and H.
For K = R, GK = Z/2 acts on Sn with quotient real projective space
RP n. The quotient map Sn →RP n is a covering space, and in particular
a ﬁbration.
Let S1 act on
S2n−1 = {(z1, . . . , zn) ∈Cn | Σ|zi|2 = 1}
by
t(z1, · · · , zn) = (tz1, · · · , tzn)
if t ∈S1 = {z ∈C | |z| = 1}.
Exercise 102. Prove that S1 acts freely.
The orbit space is denoted by CP n−1 and called complex projective space.
The projection S2n−1 →CP n−1 is a ﬁbration with ﬁber S1.
(Can you
prove directly that this is a ﬁber bundle?)
In fact, if one uses the map
p : S2n−1 →CP n−1 to adjoin a 2n-cell, one obtains CP n. Thus complex
projective space is a CW-complex.
Notice that CP n is a subcomplex of CP n+1, and in fact CP n+1 is ob-
tained from CP n by adding a single 2n+2-cell. One deﬁnes inﬁnite complex
projective space CP ∞to be the union of the CP n, with the CW-topology.

6.14. Examples of ﬁbrations
149
Exercise 103. Using the long exact sequence for a ﬁbration, show that
CP ∞is an Eilenberg–MacLane space of type K(Z, 2), i.e. a CW-complex
with π2 the only non-zero homotopy group and π2 ∼= Z.
Similarly, there is a ﬁbration
S3 →S4n−1 →HP n−1
using quaternions in the previous construction.
The space HP n−1 is called
quaternionic projective space.
Exercise 104.
1. Calculate the cellular chain complexes for CP k and HP k.
2. Compute the ring structure of H∗(CP k; Z) and H∗(HP k; Z) using
Poincar´e duality.
3. Examine whether OP k can be deﬁned this way, for k > 1.
4. Show these reduce to Hopf ﬁbrations for k = 1.
6.14.3. More general homogeneous spaces and ﬁbrations.
Deﬁnition 6.48.
1. The Stiefel manifold Vk(Rn) is the space of orthonormal k-frames in
Rn:
Vk(Rn) = {(v1, v2, . . . , vk) ∈(Rn)k | vi · vj = δij}
given the topology as a subspace of (Rn)k = Rnk.
2. The Grassmann manifold or grassmannian Gk(Rn) is the space of k-
dimensional subspaces (a.k.a. k-planes) in Rn. It is given the quotient
topology using the surjection Vk(Rn) →Gk(Rn) taking a k-frame to
the k-plane it spans.
Let G be a compact Lie group. Let H ⊂G be a closed subgroup (and
hence a Lie group itself). The quotient G/H is called a homogeneous space.
The (group) quotient map G →G/H is a principal H-bundle since H acts
freely on G by right translation. If H has a closed subgroup K, then H acts
on the homogeneous space H/K. Changing the ﬁber of the above bundle
results in a ﬁber bundle G/K →G/H with ﬁber H/K.
For example, if G = O(n) and H = O(k) × O(n −k) with H →G via
(A, B) →

6. Fibrations, Coﬁbrations and Homotopy Groups
Exercise 105. Identify G/H with the grassmannian and G/K with the
Stiefel manifold.
Conclude that the map taking a frame to the plane it
spans deﬁnes a principal O(k) bundle Vk(Rn) →Gk(Rn).
Let
γk(Rn) = {(p, V ) ∈Rn × Gk(Rn) | p is a point in the k-plane V }.
There is a natural map γk(Rn) →Gk(Rn) given by projection on the second
coordinate. The ﬁber bundle so deﬁned is a vector bundle with ﬁber Rk (a
k-plane bundle)
Rk →γk(Rn) →Gk(Rn).
It is called the canonical (or tautological) vector bundle over the grassman-
nian.
Exercise 106. Identify the canonical bundle with the bundle obtained from
the principal O(k) bundle Vk(Rn) →Gk(Rn) by changing the ﬁber to Rk.
Exercise 107. Show there are ﬁbrations
O(n −k) →O(n) →Vk(Rn)
O(n −1) →O(n) →Sn−1
taking a matrix to its last k columns. Deduce that
πi(O(n −1)) ∼= πi(O(n))
for
i < n −2,
(6.3)
and
πi(Vk(Rn)) = 0
for
i < n −k −1.
The isomorphism of Equation (6.3) is an example of “stability” in alge-
braic topology. In this case it leads to the following construction. Consider
the inﬁnite orthogonal group
O = lim
n→∞O(n) =
∞∪
n=1 O(n),
where O(n) ⊂O(n + 1) is given by the continuous monomorphism
A →

Topologize O as the expanding union of the O(n). Then any compact
subset of O is contained in O(n) for some n, hence πiO = lim
n→∞πi(O(n)) =
πi(O(n)) for any n > i + 2.
A famous theorem of Bott says:

πkO ∼= πk+8O

An element of πkO is given by an element of πk(O(n)), for some n, which
by clutching (see Section 4.3.3) corresponds to a bundle over Sk+1 with
structure group O(n).
(Alternatively, one may use that πk+1(BO(n)) ∼=
πk(O(n)) using the long exact sequence of homotopy groups of the ﬁbration
O(n) →EO(n) →BO(n)). The generators of the ﬁrst eight homotopy
groups of O are given by Hopf bundles.
Similarly one can consider stable Stiefel manifolds and stable grassma-
nians.
Let Vk(R∞) = lim
n→∞Vk(Rn) and Gk(R∞) = lim
n→∞Gk(Rn).
Then
πi(Vk(R∞)) = lim
n→∞πi(Vk(Rn)) and πi(Gk(R∞)) = lim
n→∞πi(Gk(Rn)).
In
particular πi(Vk(R∞)) = 0.
A project for Chapter 4 was to show that for every topological group G,
there is a principal G-bundle EG →BG where EG is contractible.
This bundle classiﬁes principal G-bundles in the sense that given a prin-
cipal G-bundle p : G →E →B over a CW-complex B (or more generally a
paracompact space), there is a map of principal G-bundles

and that the homotopy class [f] ∈[B, BG] is uniquely determined. It follows
that the (weak) homotopy type of BG is uniquely determined.
Corollary 6.50. The inﬁnite grassmannian Gk(R∞) is a model for BO(k).
The principal O(k) bundle
O(k) →Vk(R∞) →Gk(R∞)
is universal and classiﬁes principal O(k)-bundles. The canonical bundle
Rk →γk(R∞) →Gk(R∞)
classiﬁes Rk-vector bundles with structure group O(k) (i.e. Rk-vector bun-
dles equipped with metric on each ﬁber which varies continuously from ﬁber
to ﬁber).
The fact that the grassmannian classiﬁes orthogonal vector bundles
makes sense from a geometric point of view. If M ⊂Rn is a k-dimensional
smooth submanifold, then for any point p ∈M, the tangent space TpM

deﬁnes a k-plane in Rn, and hence a point in Gk(Rn). Likewise a tangent
vector determines a point in the canonical bundle γk(Rn). Thus there is a
bundle map

Moreover, Gk(R∞) is also a model for BGLk(R) and hence is a clas-
sifying space for k-plane bundles over CW-complexes. This follows either
by redoing the above discussion, replacing k-frames by sets of k-linearly
independent vectors, or by using the fact that O(k) →GLk(R) is a ho-
motopy equivalence, with the homotopy inverse map being given by the
Gram-Schmidt process.
Similar statements apply in the complex setting to unitary groups U(n).
Let
Gk(Cn) = complex k-planes in Cn
Gk(Cn) = U(n)/(U(k) × U(n −k)),
the complex grassmanian
Vk(Cn) = U(n)/U(n −k),
the unitary Stiefel manifold.
There are principal ﬁber bundles
U(n −k) →U(n) →Vk(Cn)
and
U(k) →Vk(Cn) →Gk(Cn).
Moreover, V1(Cn) ∼= S2n−1, therefore
πk(U(n)) ∼= πk(U(n −1)) if k < 2n −2
and so letting
U = lim
n→∞U(n),
we conclude that
πkU = πk(U(n)) for n > 1 + k

Bott periodicity holds for the unitary group; the precise statement is the

of O(n), so πk(SO(n)) = πk(O(n)) for k ≥1. Similarly, since πk(S1) = 0
for k > 1, π1(SU(n)) = 0 and πkSU(n) = πk(U(n)) for k > 1.
Exercise 109. Prove that SO(2) = U(1) = S1, SO(3) ∼= RP 3, SU(2) ∼=

where a, b ∈S3 ⊂H and v ∈H ∼= R4 is a 2-fold covering map.
Exercise 110. Using Exercise 109 and the facts:
1. πnSn = Z (Hopf degree Theorem).
2. πkSn = 0 for k < n (Hurewicz theorem).
3. πkSn ∼= πk+1Sn+1 for k < 2n −1 (Freudenthal suspension theorem).
4. There is a covering Z →R →S1.
5. πnSn−1 = Z/2 for n > 3 (this theorem is due to V. Rohlin and G.
Whitehead; see Corollary 9.27).
Compute as many homotopy groups of Sn’s, O(n), Grassmann manifolds,

6.15. Relative homotopy groups
Let (X, A) be a pair, with base point x0 ∈A ⊂X. Let p = (1, 0, · · · , 0) ∈
Sn−1 ⊂Dn.
Deﬁnition 6.52. The relative homotopy group (set if n = 1) of the pair
(X, A) is
πn(X, A, x0) = [Dn, Sn−1, p; X, A, x0],
the set of based homotopy classes of base point preserving maps from the
pair (Dn, Sn−1) to (X, A). This is a functor from pairs of spaces to sets
(n = 1), groups (n = 2), and abelian groups (n > 2).
Thus, representatives for πn(X, A, x0) are maps f : Dn →X such that
f(Sn−1) ⊂A, f(p) = x0 and f is equivalent to g if there exists a homotopy

154
6. Fibrations, Coﬁbrations and Homotopy Groups
F : Dn × I →X so that for each t ∈I, F(−, t) is base point preserving and
takes Sn−1 into A, and F(−, 0) = f, F(−, 1) = g.
(Technical note: associativity is easier to see if instead one takes
πn(X, A, x0) = [Dn, Sn−1, P; X, A, x0]
where P is one-half of a great circle, running from p to −p, e.g.
P = {(cos θ, sin θ, 0, · · · , 0) | θ ∈[0, π]}.
This corresponds to the previous deﬁnition since the reduced cone on the
sphere is the disk.)
Theorem 6.53 (long exact sequence in homotopy of a pair). The homotopy
set πn(X, A) is a group for n ≥2, and is abelian for n ≥3. Moreover, there
is a long exact sequence
· · · →πnA →πnX →πn(X, A) →πn−1A →· · · →π1(X, A) →π0A →π0X.
Proof. The proof that πn(X, A) is a group is a standard exercise, with
multiplication based on the idea of the following picture.

Exercise 111. Concoct an argument from this picture and use it to ﬁgure
out why π1(X, A) is not a group. Also use it to prove that the long exact
sequence is exact.
Lemma 6.54. Let f : E →B be a ﬁbration with ﬁber F. Let A ⊂B be a
subspace, and let G = f−1(A), so that F →G
f−→A is a ﬁbration. Then
f induces isomorphims f∗: πk(E, G) →πk(B, A) for all k. In particular,

with all vertical maps isomorphisms, taking the long exact sequence of the
pair (E, F) to the long exact sequence in homotopy for the ﬁbration F →
E →B.
Proof. This is a straightforward application of the homotopy lifting prop-
erty.
Suppose that h0 : (Dk, Sk−1) →(B, A) is a map.
Viewed as a
map Dk →B it is nullhomotopic, i.e.
homotopic to the constant map
cb0 = h1 : Dk →B. Let H be a homotopy, and let ˜h1 : Dk →G ⊂E be
the constant map at the base point of G. Since f ◦˜h1 = h1 = H(−, 1), the
homotopy lifting property implies that there is a lift H : Dk × I →E with
f ◦H(−, 0) = h0. This proves that f∗: πk(E, G) →πk(B, A) is surjective.
A similar argument shows that f∗: πk(E, G) →πk(B, A) is injective.

Exercise 112. Prove that the diagram (6.4) commutes. You will ﬁnd the
constructions in the proof of Theorem 6.39 useful. Notice that the com-
mutativity of this diagram and the fact that f∗is an isomorphism gives an
alternative deﬁnition of the connecting homomorphism πk(B) →πk−1(F)
in the long exact sequence of the ﬁbration F →E →B.
An alternative and useful perspective on Theorem 6.53 is obtained by
replacing a pair by a ﬁbration as follows.
Turn A →X into a ﬁbration, with A′ replacing A and L(X, A) the ﬁber.
Using the construction of Section 6.6 we see that
L(X, A) = {(a, α) | α : I →X, α(0) = a ∈A, α(1) = x0}
= Map((I, 0, 1), (X, A, x0)).
This shows that if ΩX →PX
e−→X denotes the path space ﬁbration,
then L(X, A) = PX|A = e−1(A). Thus Lemma 6.54 shows that e induces
an isomorphism e∗: πk(PX, L(X, A)) →πk(X, A) for all k.
Since PX
is contractible, using the long exact sequence for the pair (PX, L(X, A))
gives an isomorphism ∂: πk(PX, L(X, A))

Homotopy groups are harder to compute and deal with than homology
groups, essentially because excision fails for relative homotopy groups. In
Chapter 8 we will discuss stable homotopy and generalized homology the-
ories, in which (properly interpreted) excision does hold. Stabilization is a
procedure which looks at a space X only in terms of what homotopy infor-
mation remains in SnX as n gets large. The ﬁber L(X, A) and coﬁber X/A
are stably homotopy equivalent.
6.16. The action of the fundamental group on
homotopy sets
The question which arises naturally when studying based spaces is what is
the diﬀerence between the based homotopy classes [X, Y ]0 and the unbased
classes [X, Y ]? Worrying about base points can be a nuisance. It turns out
that for simply connected spaces one need not worry; the based and unbased
homotopy sets are the same. In general, the fundamental group acts on the
based set as we will now explain.
Let X be in K∗, that is, it is a based space with a non-degenerate base
point x0. Suppose Y is a based space.
Deﬁnition 6.55. Let f0, f1 : X →Y . Let u : I →Y be a path and suppose
there is a homotopy F : X × I →Y from f0 to f1 so that F(x0, t) = u(t).
Then we say f0 is freely homotopic to f1 along u, and write
f0 ≃u f1.
Notice that if f0, f1 : (X, x0) →(Y, y0), then u is a loop. Thus a free
homotopy of based maps gives rise to an element of π1(Y, y0).
Lemma 6.56.
1. (Existence) Given a map f0 : X →Y and a path u in Y starting at
f0(x0), then f0 ≃u f1 for some f1.
2. (Uniqueness) Suppose f0 ≃u f1, f0 ≃v f2 and u ≃v (rel ∂I). Then
f1
≃
const f2.
3. (Multiplicativity) f0 ≃u f1, f1 ≃v f2 =⇒f0 ≃
uv f2

6.16. The action of the fundamental group on homotopy sets
157
Proof. 1. There exists a free homotopy F : X × I →Y with F(x0, t) =
u(t), F(−, 0) = f0, since (X, x0) is a coﬁbration:
X × {0} ∪{x0} × I

2. Since (I, ∂I), (X, x0) are coﬁbrations, so is their product (X × I, X ×

X × I × {0} ∪X × {0, 1} × I ∪{x0} × I × I

2. X × {0} × I →Y is the homotopy of f0 to f1 along u.
3. X × {1} × I →Y is the homotopy of f0 to f2 along v.
4. {x0} × I × I →Y is the path homotopy of u to v.
The situation is represented in the following picture of a cube X ×I ×I.
therefore f1 ≃f2

6. Fibrations, Coﬁbrations and Homotopy Groups
3. This is clear.
In light of Lemma 6.56, we can deﬁne an action of π1(Y, y0) on [X, Y ]0
by the following recipe.
For [u] ∈π1(Y, y0) and [f] ∈[X, Y ]0, deﬁne [u][f] to be [f1], where f1 is
any map so that f ≃u f1.
Theorem 6.57. This deﬁnes an action of π1(Y, y0) on the based set [X, Y ]0,
and [X, Y ] is the quotient set of [X, Y ]0 by this action if Y is path connected.
Proof. We need to verify that this action is well-deﬁned. It is independent
of the choice of representative of [u] by Lemma 6.56, part 2. Suppose now
[f] = [g] ∈[X, Y ]0 and g ≃u g1. Then
f1
≃
u−1 f
≃
const g ≃u g1
so that f1 and g1 are based homotopic by Lemma 6.56, parts 2 and 3.
This is an action of the group π1(Y, y0) on the set [X, Y ]0 by Lemma
6.56, part 3. Let
Φ : [X, Y ]0 →[X, Y ]
be the forgetful functor. Clearly Φ([u][f]) = [f] and if Φ[f0] = Φ[f1], then
there is a u so that [u][f0] = [f1]. Finally Φ is onto by Lemma 6.56, part 3
and the fact that Y is path-connected.
Corollary 6.58. A based map of path connected spaces is null-homotopic
if and only if it is based null-homotopic.
Proof. If c denotes the constant map, then clearly c ≃u c for any u ∈π1Y .
Thus π1Y ﬁxes the class in [X, Y ]0 containing the constant map.
Corollary 6.59. Let X, Y ∈K∗.
If Y is a path connected and simply-
connected space then the forgetful functor [X, Y ]0 →[X, Y ] is bijective.
6.16.1. Alternative description in terms of covering spaces. Sup-
pose Y is path connected, and X is simply connected. Then covering space
theory says that any map f : (X, x0) →(Y, y0)
lifts to a unique map
˜f : (X, x0) →( ˜Y , ˜y0), where ˜Y denotes the universal cover of Y . Moreover
based homotopic maps lift to based homotopic maps. Thus the function
p∗: [X, ˜Y ]0 →[X, Y ]0
induced by the cover p : ( ˜Y , ˜y0) →(Y, y0) is a bijection. On the other hand,
since ˜Y is path connected and simply connected, Corollary 6.59 shows that
the function [X, ˜Y ]0 →[X, ˜Y ] induced by the inclusion is a bijection.

6.16. The action of the fundamental group on homotopy sets
159
Now π1(Y, y0) can be identiﬁed with group of covering transformations
of ˜Y . Thus, π1(Y, y0) acts on [X, ˜Y ] by post composition i.e. α : ˜Y →˜Y
acts on f : X →˜Y by α ◦f. (Note: one must be careful with left and right
actions: by convention π1(Y, y0) acts on ˜Y on the right, so α ◦f means the
function x →f(x) · α.)
A standard exercise in covering space theory shows that if α ∈π1(Y, y0)
the diagram
[X, Y ]0
[X, ˜Y ]0
[X, ˜Y ]
[X, Y ]0
[X, ˜Y ]0

commutes, where the action on the left is via an α-homotopy, and the action
on the right is the action induced by the covering translation corresponding
to α, and the two left horizontal bijections are induced by the covering
projection. Thus the two notions of action agree.
Since πnY = [Sn, Y ]0, we have the following corollary.
Corollary 6.60. For any space Y , π1(Y, y0) acts on πn(Y, y0) for all n with
quotient [Sn, Y ], the set of free homotopy classes.
One could restrict to simply connected spaces Y and never worry about
the distinction between based and unbased homotopy classes of maps into Y .
This is not practical in general, and so instead one can make a dimension-
by-dimension deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 6.61. We say Y is n-simple if π1Y acts trivially on πnY . We
say Y is simple if Y is n-simple for all n.
Thus, simply connected spaces are simple.
Proposition 6.62. If F is n-simple, then the ﬁbration F →E →B deﬁnes
a local coeﬃcient system over B with ﬁber πnF.
(A good example to think about is the Klein bottle mapping onto the
circle.)
Proof. Theorem 6.12 shows that given any ﬁbration, F →E →B, there
is a well-deﬁned homomorphism
π1B →
 Homotopy classes of self-homotopy
equivalences F →F

6. Fibrations, Coﬁbrations and Homotopy Groups
A homotopy equivalence induces a bijection

But, since we are assuming that F is n-simple, this is the same as an auto-
morphism
πnF →πnF
Thus, we obtain a homomorphism
ρ : π1B →Aut(πn(F)),
i.e. a local coeﬃcient system over B.
Exercise 113. Prove that the action of π1(Y, y0) on itself is just given by
conjugation, so that Y is 1-simple if and only if π1Y is abelian.
Exercise 114. Show that a topological group is simple. (In fact H-spaces
are simple.)
Theorem 6.63. The group π1A acts on πn(X, A), πnX, and πnA for all n.
Moreover, the long exact sequence of the pair
· · · →πnA →πnX →πn(X, A) →πn−1A →· · ·
is π1A-equivariant.
Proof. Let h : (I, 0, 1) →(A, x0, x0) represent u ∈π1(A, x0).
Let f :
(Dn, Sn−1, p) →(X, A, x0). Then since (Sn−1, p) is an NDR–pair, the prob-

Taking u · [f] = [F(−, 1)] deﬁnes
the action of π1(A, x0) on πn(X, A; x0). It follows immediately from the
deﬁnitions that the maps in the long exact sequence are π1A-equivariant.

6.17. The Hurewicz and Whitehead Theorems
161
Deﬁnition 6.64. A pair (X, A) is n-simple if π1A acts trivially on πn(X, A)
for all n.
6.17. The Hurewicz and Whitehead Theorems
Perhaps the most important result of homotopy theory is the Hurewicz
Theorem. We will state the general relative version of the Hurewicz theorem
and its consequence, the Whitehead theorem, in this section.
Recall that Dn is oriented as a submanifold of Rn, i.e., the chart Dn →
Rn determines the local orientation at any x ∈Dn via the excision iso-
morphism Hn(Dn, Dn −{x}) ∼= Hn(Rn, Rn −{x}). This determines the
fundamental class [Dn, Sn−1] ∈Hn(Dn, Sn−1). The sphere Sn−1 is oriented
as the boundary of Dn, i.e. the fundamental class [Sn−1] ∈Hn−1(Sn−1) is
deﬁned by [Sn−1] = δ([Dn, Sn−1]) where δ : Hn(Dn, Sn−1)
∼
=
−→Hn−1(Sn−1)
is the connecting homomorphism in the long exact sequence for the pair
(Dn, Sn−1).
Deﬁnition 6.65. The Hurewicz map ρ : πnX →HnX is deﬁned by
ρ([f]) = f∗([Sn]),
where f : Sn →X represents an element of πnX, [Sn] ∈HnSn ∼= Z is the
generator (given by the natural orientation of Sn) and f∗: HnSn →HnX
the induced map.
There is also a relative Hurewicz map ρ : πn(X, A) →Hn(X, A) deﬁned
by
ρ([f]) = f∗([Dn, Sn−1]).
Here [Dn, Sn−1] ∈Hn(Dn, Sn−1) ∼= Z is the generator given by the natu-
ral orientation, and f∗: Hn(Dn, Sn−1) →Hn(X, A) is the homomorphism
induced by f : (Dn, Sn−1, ∗) →(X, A, x0) ∈πn(X, A; x0).
Since the connecting homomorphism Hn(Dn, Sn−1)
∂−→Hn−1(Sn−1) takes
[Dn, Sn−1] to [Sn−1], the map of exact sequences

Let π+
n (X, A) be the quotient of πn(X, A) by the normal subgroup gen-
erated by
{x(α(x))−1|x ∈πn(X, A), α ∈π1A}.
(Thus π+
n (X, A) = πn(X, A) if π1A = {1}, or if (X, A) is n-simple.)

6. Fibrations, Coﬁbrations and Homotopy Groups
Clearly ρ factors through π+
n (X, A), since f∗([Dn, Sn]) depends only on
the free homotopy class of f. The following theorem is the subject of one of
the projects for this chapter. It says that for simply connected spaces, the
ﬁrst non-vanishing homotopy and homology groups coincide. The Hurewicz
theorem is the most important result in algebraic topology. We will give a
proof the Hurewicz theorem for simply connected spaces in Chapter 10.
Theorem 6.66 (Hurewicz theorem).
1. Let n > 0. Suppose that X is path-connected. If πk(X, x0) = 0 for all
k < n, then Hk(X) = 0 for all 0 < k < n, and the Hurewicz map
ρ : πnX →HnX
is an isomorphism if n > 1, and a surjection with kernel the commu-
tator subgroup of π1X if n = 1.
2. Let n > 1. Suppose X and A are path-connected. If πk(X, A) = 0 for
all k < n then Hk(X, A) = 0 for all k < n, and
ρ : π+
n (X, A) →Hn(X, A)
is an isomorphism. In particular ρ : πn(X, A) →Hn(X, A) is an
epimorphism.
Corollary 6.67 (Hopf degree theorem). The Hurewicz map ρ : πnSn →
HnSn is an isomorphism. Hence a degree zero map f : Sn →Sn is null-
homotopic.
Although we have stated this as a corollary of the Hurewicz theorem,
it can be proven directly using only the (easy) simplicial approximation
theorem. (The Hopf degree theorem was covered as a project in Chapter 5.)
Deﬁnition 6.68.
1. A space X is called n-connected if πkX = 0 for k ≤n. (Thus “simply
connected” is synonymous with 1-connected).
2. A pair (X, A) is called n-connected if πk(X, A) = 0 for k ≤n.
3. A map f : X →Y is called n-connected if the pair (Mf, X) is n-
connected, where Mf = mapping cylinder of f.
Using the long exact sequence for (Mf, X) and the homotopy equivalence
Mf ∼Y we see that f is n-connected if and only if
f∗: πkX →πkY
is an isomorphism for k < n and an epimorphism for k = n. Replacing the
map f : X →Y by a ﬁbration and using the long exact sequence for the

6.17. The Hurewicz and Whitehead Theorems
163
homotopy groups of a ﬁbration shows that f is n-connected if and only if
the homotopy ﬁber of f is (n −1)-connected.
Corollary 6.69 (Whitehead theorem).
1. If f : X →Y is n-connected, then f∗: HqX →HqY is an isomor-
phism for all q < n and an epimorphism for q = n.
2. If X, Y are 1-connected, and f : X →Y is a map such that
f∗: HqX →HqY
is an isomorphism for all q < n and an epimorphism for q = n. Then

3. If X, Y are 1-connected spaces, f : X →Y a map inducing an isomor-
phism on Z-homology, then f induces isomorphisms f∗: πkX

for all k.
Exercise 115. Prove Corollary 6.69.
A map f : X →Y inducing an isomorphism of πkX →πkY for all k
is called a weak homotopy equivalence. Thus a map inducing a homology
isomorphism between simply connected spaces is a weak homotopy equiva-
lence. Conversely a weak homotopy equivalence between two spaces gives a
homology isomorphism.
We will see later (Theorem 7.34) that if X, Y are CW-complexes, then
f : X →Y is a weak homotopy equivalence if and only if f is a homotopy
equivalence. As a consequence,
Corollary 6.70. A continuous map f : X →Y between simply connected
CW-complexes inducing an isomorphism on all Z-homology groups is a ho-
motopy equivalence.
This corollary does not imply that if X, Y are two simply connected
spaces with the same homology, then they are homotopy equivalent; one
needs a map inducing the homology equivalence.
For example, X = S4 ∨(S2 × S2) and Y = CP 2 ∨CP 2 are simply con-
nected spaces with the same homology. They are not homotopy equivalent
because their cohomology rings are diﬀerent. In particular, there does not
exist a continuous map from X to Y inducing isomorphisms on homology.
The Whitehead theorem for non-simply connected spaces involves ho-
mology with local coeﬃcients: If f : X →Y is a map, let ˜f : ˜X →˜Y
be the corresponding lift to universal covers. Recall from Shapiro’s lemma
(Exercise 75) that
Hk( ˜X; Z) ∼= Hk(X, Z[π1X])
for all k

164
6. Fibrations, Coﬁbrations and Homotopy Groups
and
πk ˜X ∼= πkX
for k > 1
(and similarly for Y ).
We obtain (with π = π1X ∼= π1Y ):
Theorem 6.71. If f : X →Y induces an isomorphism f∗: π1X →π1Y ,
then f is n-connected if and only if it induces isomorphisms
Hk(X; Z[π]) →Hk(Y ; Z[π])
for k < n and an epimorphism
Hn(X; Z[π]) →Hn(Y ; Z[π])
In particular, f is a weak homotopy equivalence (homotopy equivalence if
X, Y are CW-complexes) if only if f∗: Hk(X; Aρ) →Hk(Y ; Aρ) is an iso-
morphism for all local coeﬃcient systems ρ : π →Aut(A).
Thus, in the presence of a map f : X →Y , homotopy equivalences can
be detected by homology.

Obstruction theory addresses the following types of problems. Let (X, A)
be a CW-pair, Y an arbitrary space, and p : E →B a ﬁbration.

f extend to all of X? The problem is stated in the following diagram.

In words, given two maps f0, f1 : X →Y and a homotopy of the restrictions
f0|A : A →Y to f1|A : A →Y , can one ﬁnd a homotopy from f0 to f1?
If A is empty this is just the question of whether two maps f0 and f1 are
homotopic. This problem is diﬀerent from the homotopy extension problem
(which is always solvable in our context) since in this case f1 is speciﬁed.
Notice that the the homotopy problem is a special case of the extension
problem.

4. Cross section problem. This is just a special case of the relative lifting
problem in the case when X = B and f : X →B is the identity map.
The cross section and relative lifting problems are equivalent since the
relative lifting problem reduces to ﬁnding a cross section of the pullback
bundle f∗E →X.
Fibrations and coﬁbrations are easier to work with than arbitrary maps
since they have ﬁbers and coﬁbers. Although we have required that (X, A)
be a CW-pair and p : E →B be a ﬁbration, the methods of Chapter 6 show
how to work in complete generality. Suppose that X and A are arbitrary
CW-complexes and g : A →X is an arbitrary continuous map. The cellular
approximation theorem (Theorem 6.47) implies that g is homotopic to a
cellular map; call it h : A →X. The mapping cylinder Mh is then a CW-
complex containing A as a subspace and (Mh, A) is a CW-pair. Similarly if

7.1. Basic problems of obstruction theory
167
p : E →B is not a ﬁbration, replace E by the mapping path space Pp of p
to obtain a ﬁbration Pp →B.
Then the following exercise is an easy consequence of the homotopy lift-
ing property, the homotopy extension property, and the method of turning
maps into ﬁbrations or coﬁbrations.
Exercise 116. Each of the four problems stated above is solvable for arbi-
trary continuous maps g : A →X and p : E →B between CW-complexes if
and only if it is solvable for the CW-pair (Mh, A) and the ﬁbration Pp →E.
To solve the following exercise, work cell-by-cell one dimension at a time.
Obstruction theory is a formalization of this geometric argument.
Exercise 117. (Motivating exercise of obstruction theory) Any map f :
X →Y from an n-dimensional CW-complex to an n-connected space is
null-homotopic.
It turns out that if Y is only assumed to be (n −1)-connected there is a
single obstruction θ(f) ∈Hn(X; πnY ) which vanishes if and only if the map
f is null-homotopic.
The strategy of obstruction theory is to solve the four problems cell-
by-cell, and skeleton-by-skeleton. Thus, if the problem is solved over the
n-skeleton Xn of X, and en+1 is an (n + 1)-cell on X, some map is deﬁned
on ∂en+1 and so the problem is to extend it over en+1. The obstruction
to extending this map is that it be nullhomotopic, or, more formally, that
the element of πnY represented by the composite Sn →∂en+1 →Xn →Y
equals zero.
In this way we obtain a cellular cochain which assigns to en+1 ∈X the
element in πnY . If this cochain is the zero cochain, then the map can be
extended over the (n + 1)-skeleton of X. It turns out this cochain is in fact
a cocycle and so represents a cohomology class in Hn+1(X; πnY ).
The remarkable result is that if this cocycle represents the zero cohomol-
ogy class, then by redeﬁning the map on the n-skeleton one can then extend
it over the (n + 1)-skeleton of X (if you take one step backwards, then you
will be able to take two steps forward).
We will deal with the extension and homotopy problems ﬁrst. The ho-
motopy problem can be viewed as a relative form of the extension problem;
just take
(X′, A′) = (X × I, X × ∂I ∪A × I).
Hence the problem of ﬁnding a homotopy between f : X →Y and g :
X →Y is obstructed by classes in Hn+1(X × I, X × {0, 1}; πnY ), which is
isomorphic to Hn(X; πnY ).

168
7. Obstruction Theory and Eilenberg-MacLane Spaces
We end this introduction to obstruction theory with some comments to
indicate how the results of obstruction theory lead to a major conceptual
shift in perspective on what homology is.
Let A be an abelian group and K(A, n) be a space such that
πk(K(A, n)) =

A
if k = n,
0
otherwise.
Such a space is called an Eilenberg-MacLane space of type (A, n).
Then the
solution to the homotopy problem for maps into Y = K(A, n) shows that
there is a single obstruction θ ∈Hn(X; πn(K(A, n))) to homotoping a map
f : X →K(A, n) to another map g : X →K(A, n). With a little more work
one shows that this sets up an isomorphism
[X, K(A, n)]
∼
=
−→Hn(X; A).
This suggests one could deﬁne Hn(X; A) to be [X, K(A, n)]. This obser-
vation forms the basic link between the homological algebra approach to co-
homology and homotopy theory. From this perspective the Puppe sequence
(Theorem 6.42) immediately gives the long exact sequence in cohomology,
and the other Eilenberg–Steenrod axioms are trivial to verify. But more
importantly, it suggests that one could ﬁnd generalizations of cohomology
by replacing the sequence of spaces K(A, n) by some other sequence En,
and deﬁning functors from spaces to sets (or groups, or rings, depending on
how much structure one has on the sequence En) by
X →[X, En].
This indeed works and leads to the notion of a spectrum {En} and its cor-
responding generalized homology theory, one of the subjects of Chapter 8.
7.2. The obstruction cocycle
Suppose that (X, A) is a relative CW-complex.
We refer the reader to
Deﬁnition 1.3 for the precise deﬁnition.
Notice that X/A is a CW-complex. The dimension of (X, A) is deﬁned
to be the highest dimension of the cells attached (we allow the dimension to
be inﬁnite).
Suppose that g : A →Y a continuous map with Y path connected. We
wish to study the question of whether g can be extended to map X →Y .
Since Y is path connected, the map g : A →Y extends over the 1-
skeleton X1. Thus the zeroth and ﬁrst step in extending g : A →Y to X is
always possible (when Y is path connected).
Suppose that g : A →Y has been extended to g : Xn →Y for some
n ≥1.

7.3. Construction of the obstruction cocycle
169
We now make an simplifying assumption.
Assumption. Y is n-simple, so that [Sn, Y ] = πnY .
(We will indicate later how to avoid this assumption by using local coeﬃ-
cients.)
Theorem 7.1 (main theorem of obstruction theory). Let (X, A) be a rel-
ative CW-complex, n ≥1, and Y a path–connected n-simple space.
Let
g : Xn →Y be a continuous map.
1. There is a cellular cocycle θ(g) ∈Cn+1(X, A; πnY ) which vanishes if
and only if g extends to a map Xn+1 →Y .
2. The cohomology class [θ(g)] ∈Hn+1(X, A; πnY ) vanishes if and only
if the restriction g|Xn−1 : Xn−1 →Y extends to a map Xn+1 →Y .
The proof of this theorem will occupy several sections.
7.3. Construction of the obstruction cocycle

This deﬁnes an element [g◦fi] ∈[Sn, Y ], which equals [Sn, Y ]0 = πnY , since
Y is assumed to be n-simple.

to a map Dn+1 →Y . The following lemma follows from this fact and the
deﬁnition of adjoining cells.

7. Obstruction Theory and Eilenberg-MacLane Spaces
We gave a geometric deﬁnition of the obstruction cochain and came to
a geometric conclusion. Next we give an algebraic deﬁnition.
Recall from Section 1.1.3 that the cellular chain complex is deﬁned by
taking the chain groups to be Cn(X, A) = Hn(Xn, Xn−1). The diﬀerential
is deﬁned to be the composite
Hn(Xn, Xn−1)
∂−→Hn−1(Xn−1)
i−→Hn−1(Xn−1, Xn−2).
By the cellular approximation theorem, π1Xn →π1Xn+1 is onto if n = 1,
and an isomorphism if n > 1, so π1(Xn+1, Xn) = 0. Similarly, the cellular
approximation theorem implies that πk(Xn+1, Xn) = 0 for k ≤n, hence the
(relative) Hurewicz theorem implies that Hk(Xn+1, Xn) = 0 for k ≤n and
the Hurewicz map
ρ : πn+1(Xn+1, Xn) →Hn+1(Xn+1, Xn)
is onto, with kernel the subgroup of πn+1(Xn+1, Xn) generated by the set
K = {x(α(x))−1|x ∈πn+1(Xn+1, Xn), α ∈π1Xn}.
Recall that π+
n+1(Xn+1, Xn) denotes πn+1(Xn+1, Xn)/K.

HomZ(Cn+1(X, A)); πnY ) which we again denote by θn+1(g).
Proposition 7.5. The two deﬁnitions of θn+1(g) agree.
Proof. We ﬁrst work on the second deﬁnition. Given an (n + 1)-cell en+1
i
,
let φi : (Dn+1, Sn) →(Xn+1, Xn) be the characteristic map for the cell.
We construct a map (φi ∨u) ◦q : (Dn+1, Sn, p) →(Xn+1, Xn, x0) as the
composite of a map q : (Dn+1, Sn, p) →(Dn+1 ∨I, Sn ∨I, p), illustrated in
the next ﬁgure,

and a map Dn+1 ∨I
φi∨u
−→Xn+1 where u is a path in Xn to the base point
x0. Clearly (φi ∨u) ◦q is homotopic to the characteristic map φi. Thus
ρ((φi ∨u) ◦q) is the generator of Hn+1(Xn+1, Xn) represented by the cell
en+1
i
. Hence (φi∨u)◦q represents the element ρ−1(en+1
i
) in π+
n+1(Xn+1, Xn).
By deﬁnition, ∂((φi ∨u) ◦q) ∈πnXn is represented by the composite of
the map q : Sn →Sn ∨I (obtained by restricting the map q of the previous
ﬁgure to the boundary) and the attaching map fi = φi|Sn for the cell en+1
i
together with a path u to x0.
∂((φi ∨u) ◦q) = (fi ∨u) ◦q : Sn →Xn.
Hence by the second deﬁnition, θ(g)(en+1
i
) = g ◦(fi ∨u) ◦q. But this is
(g ◦fi ∨g ◦u) ◦q which equals [fi] ∈[Sn, Y ] = πnY , which in turn is the
ﬁrst deﬁnition of θ(g)(en+1
i
).

The unlabeled horizontal arrows are the Hurewicz maps.
The unlabeled
vertical arrows come from homotopy or homology exact sequences of the
pairs (Xn+2, Xn+1) and (Xn+1, Xn).
The theorem follows by noting that the δθ(g) is the composite of all the
right vertical maps, that the top horizontal arrow is onto by the Hurewicz
Theorem, and the composite of the bottom two vertical maps on the left
are zero, because they occur in the homotopy exact sequence of the pair
(Xn+1, Xn).
7.4. Proof of the extension theorem
Lemma 7.3 says that θn+1(g) is the zero cocycle if and only if g extends
over Xn+1. Theorem 7.1 says that if θn+1(g) is cohomologous to 0, then the
restriction of g to the (n −1)-skeleton Xn−1 extends over Xn+1. Thus to
prove Theorem 7.1 it must be shown that if θn+1(g) = δd for some cochain
d ∈Cn(X, A; πnY ), then g can be redeﬁned on the n-skeleton relative to the
(n −1)-skeleton, then extended over the (n + 1)-skeleton.
Theorem 7.7. If θn+1(g) is cohomologous to 0, then the restriction of g :
Xn →Y to the (n −1)-skeleton, g|Xn−1 : Xn−1 →Y extends over the
(n + 1)-skeleton Xn+1.
Before we prove this, we prove some preliminary lemmas which will be
useful for the homotopy classiﬁcation as well.
Lemma 7.8. Let f0, f1 : Xn →Y be two maps so that f0|Xn−1 is homotopic
to f1|Xn−1.
Then a choice of homotopy deﬁnes a diﬀerence cochain d ∈
Cn(X, A; πnY ) with
δd = θn+1(f0) −θn+1(f1).
Proof. Let ˆX = X ×I, ˆA = A×I. Then ( ˆX, ˆA) is a relative CW-complex,
with ˆXk = Xk × ∂I ∪Xk−1 × I. Hence a map ˆXn →Y is a pair of maps
f0, f1 : Xn →Y and a homotopy G : Xn−1 × I →Y of the restrictions of
f0, f1 to Xn−1.
Thus one obtains the obstruction cocycle
θ(f0, G, f1) ∈Cn+1( ˆX, ˆA; πnY )
to extending f0∪G∪f1 to ˆXn+1. From this cocycle one obtains the diﬀerence
cochain
d(f0, G, f1) ∈Cn(X, A; πnY )
by restricting to cells of the form en × I; that is,
d(f0, G, f1)(en
i ) = (−1)n+1θ(f0, G, f1)(en
i × I)
(7.2)

7.4. Proof of the extension theorem

for each en

(δθ(f0, G, f1))(en+1

=
(−1)n+1(δ(d(f0, G, f1))(en+1

i
) −θ(f0)(en+1

Therefore
δd(f0, G, f1) = θn+1(f0) −θn+1(f1).
There is a geometric interpretation for the diﬀerence cochain. Identify
Sn with ∂(Dn×I). For an n-cell en
i , let ϕi : (Dn, Sn−1) →(Xn, Xn−1) be its
characteristic map. Then ±d(f0, G, f1)(en

Lemma 7.8 immediately implies the following.
Corollary 7.9. Given g : Xn →Y , the obstruction cocycle θn+1(g) is null
homologous if the restriction g|Xn−1 : Xn−1 →Y is homotopic to a map
which extends over Xn+1.
We want is a converse.
What we need is a realization theorem, i.e.
a proof that for any coboundary δd ∈Cn+1(X, A; πnY ), any map g, and
any homotopy G, that there is a map f1 so that the diﬀerence cochain
d(g, G, f1) = d. In particular, G could be a homotopy constant in time in
which case if θn+1(g) = δd = δd(g, g|Xn−1 × IdI, f1), the previous lemma
shows that θn+1(f1) = 0, so that f1 extends over Xn+1. Since g′
|Xn−1 =

174
7. Obstruction Theory and Eilenberg-MacLane Spaces
g|Xn−1 this would ﬁnish this step in the extension process. The realization
result is the following.
Proposition 7.10. Given a map f0 : Xn →Y and a homotopy G : Xn−1 ×
I →Y , so that G0 = f0|Xn−1 and an element d ∈Cn(X, A; πnY ), there is a
map f1 : Xn →Y so that G(−, 1) = f1|Xn−1 and d = d(f0, G, f1).
Given the previous geometric description of the diﬀerence cochain all we
really need to prove is:
Lemma 7.11. For any map f : Dn × {0} ∪Sn−1 × I →Y and for any
element α ∈[∂(Dn × I), Y ], there is a map F : ∂(Dn × I) →Y so that F
represents α and restricts to f.
Proof. The proof is easy. Let K : ∂(Dn × I) →Y be any map representing
α and let D = Dn×{0} ∪Sn−1×I. Since D is contractible, both K|D and f
are null-homotopic, hence homotopic to each other and the map K gives an
extension of one end of this homotopy. The homotopy extension property
of the pair (∂(Dn × I), D) gives a homotopy H : ∂(Sn−1 × I) × I →Y and
F = H1 is the required map.
Proof of Proposition 7.10. Given an n-cell en
i of Xn, let
ϕi : (Dn, Sn−1) →(Xn, Xn−1)
be the characteristic map. Apply Lemma 7.11 with f = f0◦ϕi∪G◦(ϕi|Sn−1×
IdI) and α = d(en
i ) and let Fi be the map provided by the conclusion of
Lemma 7.11. Deﬁne f1 : Xn →Y on the n-cells by f1(ϕi(x)) = Fi(x, 1). The
geometric interpretation of the diﬀerence cochain shows d(f0, G, f1)(en
i ) =
d(en
i ) as desired.
Proof of Theorem 7.1. The only thing left to show is that if g : Xn →Y
and if θ(g) is a coboundary δd, then g|Xn−1 extends to Xn+1. Apply the
realization proposition to g, d, and the stationary homotopy ((x, t) →g(x))
from g|Xn−1 to itself . One obtains a map g′ : Xn →Y which agrees with g
upon restriction to Xn−1, and satisﬁes
δd = θ(g) −θ(g′).
Then θ(g′) = 0 so g′ extends to Xn+1.
Exercise 118. Find examples of (X, A), Y , and g where:
1. θn+1(g) = 0.
2. θn+1(g) ̸= 0, but [θn+1(g)] = 0.
3. [θn+1(g)] ̸= 0.

7.5. Obstructions to ﬁnding a homotopy
175
It is conceivable (and happens frequently) that ﬁnding an extension of
g : Xn →Y to Xn+1 may require g to be redeﬁned not just on the n-cells,
but maybe even the (n −1)-cells, or, perhaps even on the (n −k)-cells for
k = 1, · · · , r for some r.
This suggests that there may be theorems which state “given g, the re-
striction g|Xn−k extends to Xn+1 if and only if some obstruction vanishes.”
Such theorems exists, and working them out leads to the deﬁnition of sec-
ondary and higher obstructions.
To get a feel for where such obstructions may lie, notice that the ob-
struction cochain θ is the obstruction to extending g : Xn →Y to Xn+1, and
that its cohomology class [θ] is the obstruction to extending g|Xn−1 to Xn+1.
The cohomology group is a subquotient of the cochain group Cn(X, A; πnY ).
It turns out that the obstructions live in further subquotients, that is, in
subquotients of cohomology.
7.5. Obstructions to ﬁnding a homotopy
We now turn to the construction of obstructions to ﬁnding a homotopy

This is accomplished by viewing the homotopy problem as an extension
problem and then applying the K¨unneth theorem.
Consider the product relative CW-complex:
(X∗, A∗) = (X, A) × (I, ∂I) = (X × I, X × ∂I ∪A × I)
Then a map F : X∗
n →Y is a pair of maps f0, f1 : X →Y and a
homotopy of f0|Xn−1 to f1|Xn−1. Therefore the obstruction class [θn+1(F)] ∈
Hn+1(X∗, A∗; πnY ) is deﬁned. This group is isomorphic to Hn(X, A; πnY )
by the K¨unneth Theorem (this is really the suspension isomorphism). Call
the corresponding element dn(f0, f1) ∈Hn(X, A; πnY ). Then one gets the
following theorem.
Theorem 7.12. Let (X, A) be a relative CW-complex, Y an n-simple space,
f0, f1 : X →Y two maps which agree on A and F : Xn−1 × I →Y a
homotopy from f0|Xn−1 to f1|Xn−1 (rel A). Then the cohomology class of
dn(f0, f1) equals 0 if and only if the restriction of F to Xn−2 × I extends to
a homotopy of f0|Xn to f1|Xn.

An interesting special case occurs when f1 is constant (see Exercise 117).
Corollary 7.13. Any continuous map from an n-dimensional CW-complex
to an n-connected space is null-homotopic.
7.6. Primary obstructions
A case where obstruction theory is easy to use occurs if Hn+1(X, A; πnY ) = 0
for all n. This occurs quite frequently. For example, if (X, A) has dimension
a and Y is (a −1)-connected, then any map from A to Y extends to X.
The next interesting case occurs when Hk+1(X, A; πkY ) is non-zero in
only one dimension.
Then there is a single obstruction to extending g,
and this obstruction sets up a correspondence between extensions and the
corresponding cohomology group. As a ﬁrst step in understanding this cor-
respondence, we have the following theorem.
Theorem 7.14. Let (X, A) be a relative CW-complex, n ≥1, and Y an
(n −1)-connected space (if n = 1 assume π1Y is abelian). Let f : A →Y be
a map. Then f extends to a map g : Xn →Y . If g0, g1 are extensions of f,
then g0|Xn−1 ≃g1|Xn−1 (rel A) and the obstructions θn+1(g0) and θn+1(g1)
are cohomologous.
Proof. Since Y is path connected, f can be extended over X1. Since the
obstructions to extending f lie in Hr+1(X, A; πrY ), f can be extended to
Xn−1. Since the obstructions to ﬁnding a homotopy between maps lie in
Hr(X, A; πrY ) any two extensions of f are homotopic over Xn−1, and as
we saw, the diﬀerence cochain has coboundary equal to the diﬀerence of the
obstruction cocycles.
Deﬁnition 7.15. Let (X, A) be a relative CW-complex, n ≥1, and Y an
(n −1)-connected space (if n = 1 assume π1Y is abelian). Let f : A →Y
be a map. The obstruction to extending f to Xn+1 is denoted by
γn+1(f) ∈Hn+1(X, A; πnY ).
It is called the primary obstruction to extending f.
Theorem 7.14 says that the primary obstruction is well-deﬁned and van-
ishes if and only if f extends over Xn+1. We next show that it is homotopy
invariant.
Theorem 7.16. Let (X, A) be a relative CW-complex, n ≥1, and Y an
(n −1)-connected space (if n = 1 assume π1Y is abelian). Let f : A →Y be
a map. Suppose f′ is homotopic to f. Then γn+1(f′) = γn+1(f).

7.7. Eilenberg-MacLane spaces
177
Proof. By Theorem 7.14, f extends to a map g : Xn →Y and f′ extends to
a map g′ : Xn →Y . Likewise g|Xn−1 ≃g′
|Xn−1, since Y is highly connected.
Call the homotopy F. Then the diﬀerence cochain satisﬁes
δd(g, F, g′) = θ(g) −θ(g′)
by Lemma 7.8. This shows γn+1(f) and γn+1(f′) are cohomologous.
In the situation of the above theorems, if the primary obstruction van-
ishes then the map f extends to g : Xn+1 →Y . However the next obstruc-
tion class [θn+2(g)] may depend on the choice of g. So it is usually only the
primary obstruction which is computable. Obstruction theory ain’t all it’s
cracked up to be.
To deﬁne the primary obstruction for two maps to be homotopic, we
apply to above theorems to (X ×I, X ×∂I ∪A×I) and obtain the following
theorem.
Theorem 7.17. Let (X, A) be a relative CW-complex, n ≥1, and Y an
(n −1)-connected space (if n = 1 assume π1Y is abelian).
Let f0, f1 :
X →Y be two functions which agree on A. Then f0|Xn−1 ≃f1|Xn−1 rel A,
and the obstruction in Hn(X, A; πnY ) to extending this homotopy to Xn is
independent of the choice of homotopy on Xn−1 and depends only on the
homotopy classes of f0 and f1 relative to A.
In light of this theorem, one can make the following deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 7.18. Let (X, A) be a relative CW-complex, n ≥1, and Y an
(n−1)-connected space (if n = 1 assume π1Y is abelian). Let f0, f1 : X →Y
two functions which agree on A. The obstruction to constructing a homotopy
f0|Xn ≃f1|Xn rel A is denoted
dn(f0, f1) ∈Hn(X, A; πnY )
and is called the primary obstruction to homotoping f0 to f1. It depends
only on the homotopy classes of f0 and f1 relative to A.
7.7. Eilenberg-MacLane spaces
An important class of spaces are those spaces Y satisfying πkY = 0 for all
k ̸= n.
Deﬁnition 7.19. Let n be a positive integer and let π be a group, with π
abelian if n > 1. A CW-complex Y is called a K(π, n)-space if
πkY =

0
if k ̸= n
π
if k = n.

178
7. Obstruction Theory and Eilenberg-MacLane Spaces
We will see later that (π, n) determines the homotopy type of Y , that is,
for a ﬁxed pair (π, n), any two K(π, n) spaces are homotopy equivalent. A
K(π, n)-space is called an Eilenberg–MacLane space.
Theorem 7.20. Given any n > 0, and any group π with π abelian if n > 1,
there exists a K(π, n)-CW-complex.
Sketch of proof. Let ⟨xi, i ∈I|rj, j ∈J⟩be a presentation (abelian if
n > 1) of π.
Let Kn be the wedge ∨i∈I Sn of n-spheres, one for each
generator of π. Then the Van Kampen and Hurewicz theorems imply that
πkKn = 0 for k < n, π1K1 is the free group on the generators of π when
n = 1, and πnKn is the free abelian group on the generators of π when
n > 1.
For each relation, attach an (n + 1)-cell using the relation to deﬁne the
homotopy class of the attaching map. This deﬁnes a complex Kn+1 with
πk(Kn+1) =

0
if k < n
π
if k = n.
For n = 1, this follows from the Van Kampen theorem. For n > 1 and
k < n, this follows from the cellular approximation theorem and for k = n
from the Hurewicz theorem.
Attach (n + 2)-cells to kill πn+1(Kn+1). More precisely, choose a set of
generators for πn+1(Kn+1) and attach one (n + 2)-cell for each generator,
using the generator as the homotopy class of the attaching map. This gives a
(n + 2)-dimensional complex Kn+2. By the cellular approximation theorem,
the homotopy groups in dimensions less than n+1 are unaﬀected, and there
is a surjection πn+1(Kn+1) →πn+1(Kn+2). Thus
πk(Kn+2) =

0
if k < n or k = n + 1,
π
if k = n.
Now attach (n + 3)-cells to kill πn+2, etc. The union of the Kr is a
CW-complex and a K(π, n) space.
An important property of Eilenberg-MacLane spaces is that they pos-
sess fundamental cohomology classes. These classes are extremely useful.
They allow us to set up a functorial correspondence between Hn(X, π) and
[X, K(π, n)]. They are used to deﬁne cohomology operations. They can be
used to give the “ﬁbering data” needed to decompose an arbitrary space
into Eilenberg-MacLane spaces (Postnikov towers), and also to construct
characteristic classes for ﬁber bundles.
Assume π is abelian, so that K(π, n) is simple. Then
Hn(K(π, n); π) ∼= Hom(Hn(K(π, n); Z), π) ∼= Hom(π, π),

where the ﬁrst isomorphism is the adjoint of the Kronecker pairing (Exercise
11) and is an isomorphism by the universal coeﬃcient theorem (Theorem
2.29). The second map is the Hurewicz isomorphism (Theorem 6.66).
Deﬁnition 7.21. The fundamental class of the K(π, n),
ι ∈Hn(K(π, n); π),
is the class corresponding to the identity map Id : π →π under the isomor-
phisms of Equation (7.3).
The fundamental class can be used to deﬁne a function
Φ : [X, K(π, n)] →Hn(X; π)
(7.4)
by the formula
Φ([f]) = f∗[ι]
for f : X →K(π, n).
The primary obstruction class can be used to deﬁne another function
Ψ : [X, K(π, n)] →Hn(X; π)
(7.5)
by setting Ψ[f] to be the primary obstruction to homotoping f to the con-
stant map,
Ψ[f] = dn(f, const).
Theorem 7.14 shows that Ψ[f] depends only on the homotopy class of f,
and hence is well-deﬁned.
Theorem 7.22. The functions Φ and Ψ
[X, K(π, n)] →Hn(X; π)
of Equations (7.4) and (7.5) coincide, are bijections, and are natural with
respect to maps X →X′.
Proof. Step 1. Ψ is injective. Let f : X →K(π, n) be a continuous map.
Obstruction theory says that if dn(f, const) = 0, then f and the constant
map are homotopic over the n-skeleton. But all higher obstructions vanish
since they live in zero groups. Hence if Ψ[f] = 0, f is nullhomotopic. In
other words Ψ−1[0] = [const].
If we knew that [X, K(π, n)] were a group and Ψ a homomorphism,
then we could conclude that Ψ is injective. (Of course, this follows from the
present theorem.)
Instead, we will outline the argument proving the “addition formula”
dn(f, g) = dn(f, const) −dn(g, const);
i.e. dn(f, g) = Ψ[f] −Ψ[g] for any two functions f, g : X →K(π, n). This
implies that Ψ is injective.

180
7. Obstruction Theory and Eilenberg-MacLane Spaces
To see this, if F is a homotopy from f|Xn−1 to the constant map and G is
a homotopy from g|Xn−1 to the constant map then compose F and G to get
a homotopy from f|Xn−1 to g|Xn−1. (Here G means the reverse homotopy,
i.e. G = G ◦r where r(x, t) = (x, 1 −t).)
Write F ∗¯G for this homotopy from f|Xn−1 to g|Xn−1. Then on an n-
cell e ⊂X the obstruction dn(f, g)(e) ∈πn(K(π, n)) is deﬁned to be the
homotopy class of the map Sn →K(π, n) deﬁned as follows. Decompose
Sn as a neighborhood of the poles together with a neighborhood of the
equator: Sn = Dn
0 ∪(Sn−1 × I) ∪Dn
1 . Then deﬁne d = dn(f, g)(e) : Sn →
K(π, n) to be the homotopy class of the map which equals f on Dn
0 , F ∗¯G
on Sn−1 × I, and g on Dn
1 .
Since this map is constant on the equator
Sn−1 × 1
2, the homotopy class of d is clearly the sum of two classes, the
ﬁrst representing dn(f, const)(e) and the second representing dn(const, g)(e).
Therefore dn(f, g) = dn(f, const) −dn(g, const) and so Ψ[f] = Ψ[g] if and
only if f is homotopic to g.
Step 2. Ψ is surjective. We do this by proving a variant of the realization
proposition (Proposition 7.10) for the diﬀerence cochain.
Given [α] ∈Hn(X; π), choose a cocycle α representing [α]. Since the
quotient Xn/Xn−1 is the wedge of n-spheres, one for each n-cell of X, α
deﬁnes a function (up to homotopy)
g : Xn/Xn−1 →K(π, n)
by having the restriction of g to the i-th n-sphere to be a function repre-
senting α(en
i ) ∈π = πn(K(π, n)).
The function g extends to Xn+1/Xn−1 →K(π, n) because α is a cocycle.
In fact, for each (n + 1)-cell en+1
i
0 = (δα)(en+1
i
) = α(∂en+1
i
),
which implies that the composite
Sn →∂en+1
i
→Xn →Xn/Xn−1
g
−→K(π, n)
of the attaching map of en+1
i
and and g is nullhomotopic. Thus g extends
over the (n + 1)-skeleton.
Since Hn+i+1(X; πn+i(K(π, n))) = 0 for i ≥1, obstruction theory and
induction shows that there exists an extension of g : Xn/Xn−1 →K(π, n)
to ˜g : X/Xn−1 →K(π, n). Composing with the quotient map, one obtains
a map
f : X →K(π, n),

7.7. Eilenberg-MacLane spaces
181
constant on the (n−1)-skeleton, so that the characteristic map for an n-cell
en
i , induces
α(en) : Dn/∂Dn →X/Xn−1 →K(π, n).
But dn(f, const)[en] was deﬁned to be the map on Sn which equals f on the
upper hemisphere and the constant map on the lower hemisphere. Therefore
dn(f, const) equals α(en), hence Ψ[f] = [α] and so Ψ is onto.
Step 3.
Ψ is natural.
This follows from the algebraic deﬁnition of the
obstruction cocycle, but we leave the details as an exercise.
Exercise 119. Prove that Ψ is natural.
Step 4. Ψ = Φ. We ﬁrst prove this for the identity map Id : K(π, n) →
K(π, n), and then use naturality.
In other words, we need to show the
primary obstruction to ﬁnding a null homotopy of Id is the fundamental class
ι ∈Hn(K(π, n); π)). Since K(π, n) is (n −1)-connected, Id is homotopic to
a map, say Id′, which is constant on the (n −1)-skeleton K(π, n)n−1. By
the universal coeﬃcient and Hurewicz theorems,
Hn(K(π, n); π) ∼= Hom(ρ(πn(K(π, n))), π).
The deﬁnition of the fundamental class is equivalent to the formula
⟨ι, ρ[g]⟩= [g] ∈πn(K(π, n))
where ⟨, ⟩denotes the Kronecker pairing. Thus what we need to show is:
⟨dn(Id′, const), ρ[g]⟩= [g].
This is an equation which can be lifted to the cochain level, i.e. we need to
show that if [g] ∈πn(K(π, n)n, K(π, n)n−1), then
dn(Id′, const)(ρ[g]) = Id′
∗[g]
In particular, we only need verify this equation for the characteristic maps
ϕi : (Dn, Sn−1) →(K(π, n)n, K(π, n)n−1) of the n-cells. But the element
dn(Id′, const)[ρ(ϕi)] ∈πn(K(π, n)) is represented by the map Sn →K(π, n)
given by the characteristic map composed with Id′ on the upper hemisphere
and the constant map on the lower hemisphere, and this map is homotopic
the the characteristic map composed with the identity. Thus
dn(Id′, const)[ρ(ϕi)] = Id′
∗[ϕi]
as desired. Hence Φ[Id] = Ψ[Id].

182
7. Obstruction Theory and Eilenberg-MacLane Spaces
Now suppose [f] ∈[X, K(π, n)]. Then naturality of Ψ and Φ means that
the diagram
[X, K(π, n)]
[K(π, n), K(π, n)]
Hn(X; π)
Hn(K(π, n); π)
❄
Ψ,Φ

Ψ[f]
=
Ψf∗[Id]
=
f∗Ψ[Id]
=
f∗Φ[Id]
=
Φf∗[Id]

Φ[f].
Corollary 7.23. For abelian groups π and π′ and n > 1, there is a 1-1
correspondence
[K(π, n), K(π′, n)]0 = [K(π, n), K(π′, n)] ←→Hom(π, π′)
taking a map K(π, n) →K(π′, n) to the induced map on homotopy groups.
Proof.
[K(π, n), K(π′, n)]
∼=
Hn(K(π, n); π′)
∼=
Hom(Hn(K(π, n)), π′)
∼=
Hom(π, π′).
This follows from Theorem 7.22, the universal coeﬃcient theorem, and the
Hurewicz theorem. The composite is the map induced on the n-homotopy
group. That the based and unbased homotopy sets are the same follows
from Corollary 6.59 since K(π, n) is simply connected for n > 1.
Corollary 7.24. Let K(π, n) and K′(π, n) be two Eilenberg-MacLane spaces
of type (π, n) for n > 1. The identity map determines a canonical homotopy
equivalence between them.
Proof. The homotopy equivalence is simply the map K(π, n) →K′(π, n)
corresponding to the identity π →π.

7.8. Aspherical spaces
183
We shall see in the next section that Corollaries 7.23 and 7.24 continue
to hold when n = 1 and π is non-abelian provided one uses based homotopy
classes.
Computing the cohomology of Eilenberg-MacLane spaces is very impor-
tant, because of connections to cohomology operations.
Deﬁnition 7.25. For positive integers n and m and abelian groups π and
π′, a cohomology operation of type (n, π, m, π′) is a natural transformation
of functors θ : Hn(−; π) →Hm(−; π′).
For example u →u∪u gives a cohomology operation of type (n, Z, 2n, Z).
Exercise 120. (Serre) Let O(n, π, m, π′) be the set of all cohomology oper-
ations of type (n, π, m, π′). Show that θ ↔θ(ι) gives a 1-1 correspondence
O(n, π, m, π′) ←→Hm(K(π, n); π′) = [K(π, n), K(π′, m)].
We will return to this subject in Section 10.4.
7.8. Aspherical spaces
It follows from our work above that for π abelian, [X, K(π, 1)] = H1(X; π) =
Hom(H1X, π) = Hom(π1X, π).
For π non-abelian we have the following theorem.
Theorem 7.26. For a based CW-complex X, the map on fundamental groups
gives a bijection
[X, K(π, 1)]0 →Hom(π1X, π).
Sketch of Proof. We will assume that the zero-skeleton of X is a single
point. Then by the Van Kampen theorem, π1X is presented with generators
given by the characteristic maps of the 1-cells
ϕ1
i : D1/S0 →X,
and relations given by the attaching maps of the 2-cells.
ψ2
j : S1 →X
We will discuss why the above correspondence is onto. Let γ : π1X →π
be a group homomorphism. Construct a map g : X1 →K(π, 1) by deﬁning
g on a 1-cell (a circle) e1
i to be a representative of γ[ϕ1
i ]. The attaching
maps ψ2
j are trivial in π1X, and hence g∗[ψ2
j ] = γ[ψ2
j ] = γ(e) = e. Thus
g extends over the 2-skeleton. The attaching maps of the 3-cells of X are
null-homotopic in K(π, 1), so the map extends over the 3-cells. Continuing
inductively, one obtains X →K(π, 1) realizing γ on the fundamental group.

184
7. Obstruction Theory and Eilenberg-MacLane Spaces
The proof that if g, h : X →K(π, 1) are two maps inducing the same
homomorphism (i.e. g∗= h∗: π1X →π) then g is based point preserving
homotopic to h (rel x0) is similar in nature and will be omitted.
Corollary 7.27. Let K(π, 1) and K′(π, 1) be two Eilenberg-MacLane spaces
of type (π, 1).
The identity map determines a canonical based homotopy
equivalence between them.
Proposition 7.28. Suppose that
1 →L
φ−→π
γ−→H →1
is an exact sequence of (not necessarily abelian) groups. Then the homotopy
ﬁber of the map g : K(π, 1) →K(H, 1) inducing γ as in Theorem 7.26 is
K(L, 1) and that the inclusion of the ﬁber K(L, 1) →K(π, 1) induces the
homomorphism φ.
If L, π, and H are abelian, the same assertions hold with K(π, 1) re-
placed by K(π, n) for any positive integer n.
Thus short exact sequences of groups correspond exactly to ﬁbrations of
Eilenberg–MacLane spaces; the sequence of groups
1 →L →π →H →1
is a short exact sequence of groups if and only if the corresponding sequence
of spaces and maps
K(L, 1) →K(π, 1) →K(H, 1)
is a ﬁbration sequence up to homotopy.
Similarly the sequence of abelian groups
0 →L →π →H →0
is exact if and only if for any n the corresponding sequence of spaces and
maps
K(L, n) →K(π, n) →K(H, n)
is a ﬁbration sequence up to homotopy.
Exercise 121. Prove Proposition 7.28.
Deﬁnition 7.29. A space is aspherical if its universal cover is contractible.
Corollary 7.34 below implies that a CW-complex is aspherical if and
only if it is a K(π, 1).
Using K(π, 1) spaces one can deﬁne functors from groups to abelian
groups by taking homology and cohomology.
The group Hn(K(π, 1)) is

7.9. CW-approximations and Whitehead’s theorem
185
called the nth homology of the group π and is often denoted by Hn(π). Simi-
larly the nth cohomology of the group π is deﬁned by Hn(π) = Hn(K(π, 1)).
We will study these functors in greater detail in Chapter 9. Other purely
algebraic deﬁnitions of the (co)homology of groups can also be given.
Aspherical spaces are ubiquitous. Compact 2-manifolds other than the
sphere and projective space are K(π, 1)’s. Also, K(Z/2, 1) = RP ∞. More
generally K(Z/n, 1) = L∞
n , where L∞
n
is the inﬁnite lens space given as
S∞/(Z/n) where S∞⊂C∞is the inﬁnite dimensional sphere and the ac-
tion is given by multiplication by a primitive n-th root of unity in every
coordinate.
Since πn(X × Y ) = πn(X) ⊕πn(Y ), K(Zn, 1) = (S1)n, the
n-torus. The Cartan–Hadamard Theorem states that if M is a complete
Riemannian manifold with sectional curvature everywhere ≤0, then for
every point p ∈M, the exponential map
exp : TpM →M
is a covering map. In particular M is aspherical. Here is an application.
Exercise 122. If M is a complete Riemannian manifold with sectional cur-
vature everywhere ≤0, then π1M is torsion-free.
We also mention the still open
Borel conjecture. Compact aspherical manifolds with isomorphic funda-
mental groups are homeomorphic.
The K(π, 1)-spaces are important for at least three reasons.
1. If M is a Zπ-module, then H∗(K(π, 1); M) is an important algebraic
invariant of the group and the module.
2. K(π, 1) = Bπ, and hence [X, Bπ] = Hom(π1X, π)/(φ ∼gφg−1) clas-
siﬁes regular covers with deck transformations π.
3. In the study of ﬂat bundles, that is, bundles whose structure group
G reduces to a discrete group π, the classifying map X →BG factors
through some K(π, 1).
7.9. CW-approximations and Whitehead’s
theorem
Deﬁnition 7.30.
1. A weak homotopy equivalence is a map f : X →Y which induces
isomorphisms πi(X, x) →πi(Y, f(x)) for all i and for all base-points
x in X.

186
7. Obstruction Theory and Eilenberg-MacLane Spaces
2. A CW-approximation of a topological space Y is a weak homotopy
equivalence
X →Y
where X is a CW-complex.
Theorem 7.31. Any space Y has a CW-approximation.
Proof. We may reduce to the case where Y is path-connected, by approxi-
mating each path-component separately. We will inductively construct maps
gn : Xn →Y
which are n-connected, that is, give an surjection on πn and a bijection on
πi for i < n. Also the restriction of gn to the (n −1)-skeleton will be gn−1.
Take X0 to be a point.
Assume inductively the existence of an n-
connected map gn : Xn →Y , where Xn is an n-dimensional CW-complex.
Attach an (n + 1)-cell to Xn for every generator ker gn∗: πnXn →πnY
to obtain a complex X′
n+1.
Since the attaching maps are in the kernel,
gn extends to a map g′
n+1 : X′
n+1 →Y . By cellular approximation and
by construction g′
n+1∗: πiX′
n+1 →πiY is an isomorphism for i < n + 1.
(One could alternatively use the relative Hurewicz theorem). Finally, deﬁne
Xn+1 = X′
n+1 ∨(( Sn+1
i
) with an (n + 1)-sphere for each generator of the
cokernel of g′
n+1∗: πn+1X′
n+1 →πn+1Y . Deﬁne the map gn+1 : Xn+1 →Y ,
by deﬁning the map on Sn+1
i
to be a representative of the corresponding
element of the cokernel.
This shows how to construct the skeleta of X = ∪Xn. Topologize X as
a CW-complex; see Deﬁnition 1.3.
By the relative Hurewicz Theorem, a CW-approximation induces an
isomorphism on homology.
Milnor deﬁned a functorial CW-approximation using simplicial methods
([26]). This is done by deﬁning a CW-complex X with an n-cell for each
non-degenerate singular n-simplex in Y , where a non-degenerate simplex
means that it does not factor through a face map. Milnor’s construction
gives a functor from topological spaces to CW-complexes; this functor takes
a CW-complex to another complex of the same homotopy type.
A very useful theorem is given by the following.
Theorem 7.32 (coﬁbrant theorem). A map f : Y →Z is a weak homotopy
equivalence if and only if for all CW-complexes X,
f∗: [X, Y ] →[X, Z]
[g] →[f ◦g]
is a bijection.

7.9. CW-approximations and Whitehead’s theorem
187
Proof. (⇐=) When Y and Z are simple (e.g. simply-connected), then by
choosing X to be the n-sphere n = 0, 1, 2, . . . , one sees that f is a weak
homotopy equivalence. We omit the proof without the simplicity hypothesis
and refer the reader to Whitehead’s book [43].
(=⇒) Philosophically, f∗is a bijection, since it is for spheres and disks,
and CW-complexes are built from spheres and disks. A easy proof along
these lines can be given using the Puppe sequence for ﬁnite–dimensional
CW-complexes, but for the general case we need a lemma similar to the
motivating exercise (Exercise 117).
Lemma 7.33. Let g : (X, A) →(Z, Y ) be a map of pairs where (X, A) is
a relative CW-complex and Y →Z is a weak homotopy equivalence. Then
g ≃h (rel A) where h(X) ⊂Y .
Proof. We will construct a sequence of maps hn : X →Z so that hn(Xn) ⊂
Y with h−1 = g and hn−1 ≃hn (rel Xn−1). (Slowly drag g into Y .) Then
for a point x in an open n-cell, we deﬁne h(x) = hn(x), and the homotopy
from g to h is deﬁned by squeezing the homotopy hn−1 ≃hn into the time
interval [1 −(1/2n), 1 −(1/2n+1)] ⊂[0, 1].
Assume inductively that hn−1 : X →Z has been constructed. Let
ϕi : (Dn, Sn−1) →(Xn, Xn−1)
be the characteristic map of an n-cell. Since πn(Z, Y ) = 0, the map
hn−1 ◦ϕi : (Dn, Sn−1) →(Z, Y )
is homotopic rel Sn−1 to a map hn,i whose image lies in Y . (See Exercise
123 below for this interpretation of the vanishing of the relative homotopy
group.) Then deﬁne hn : Xn →Y by
hn(ϕi(e)) = hn,i(e)
where e ∈Dn. Using the above homotopy, one sees hn−1|Xn ≃hn : Xn →
Z. Apply the homotopy extension theorem to extend this to a homotopy
H : X × I →Z and deﬁne hn(x) as H(x, 1).
We now return to the proof of the coﬁbrant theorem. We have a weak
homotopy equivalence f : Y →Z, which we may as well assume is the
inclusion of a subspace by replacing Z by a mapping cylinder. We see
f∗: [X, Y ] →[X, Z]
is onto by applying the lemma to the pair (X, ∅). We see f∗is injective by
applying the lemma to the pair (X × I, X × {0, 1}).

Exercise 123. Let Y ⊂Z be path-connected spaces. If πn(Z, Y, y0) = 0,
show that any map f : (Dn, Sn−1) →(Z, Y ) is homotopic rel Sn−1 to a map
whose image lies in Y .
Corollary 7.34 (Whitehead theorem). A weak homotopy equivalence be-
tween CW-complexes is a homotopy equivalence.
Proof. Let f : Y →Z be a weak homotopy equivalence between CW-
complexes. By the surjectivity of f∗: [Z, Y ] →[Z, Z], there is a g : Z →Y
so that [IdZ] = f∗[g] = [f ◦g]. Then
f∗[g ◦f] = [f ◦g ◦f] = [IdZ ◦f] = [f ◦IdY ] = f∗[IdY ].
By the injectivity of f∗, [g ◦f] = [IdY ], so f and g are homotopy inverses.
Corollary 7.35. Any n-connected CW-complex Y has the homotopy type
of a CW-complex X whose n-skeleton is a point.
Proof. Apply the proof of the CW-approximation to Y to ﬁnd a weak
homotopy equivalence X →Y where Xn is a point. By Corollary 7.34 it is
a homotopy equivalence.
Theorem 7.36. Let f : X →Y be a continuous map. Suppose that CW-
approximations u : X′ →X and v : Y ′ →Y are given. Then there exists a
map f′ so that the diagram

commutes up to homotopy. Furthermore the map f′ is unique up to homo-
topy.
The theorem follows from the coﬁbrant theorem (v∗is a bijection.) Ap-
plying it to the case where f = IdX we see that CW-approximations are
unique up to homotopy type. The theorem and the coﬁbrant theorem imply
that for the purposes of homotopy theory, one may as well assume all spaces
involved are CW-complexes.
A relative version of the coﬁbrant theorem
gives the same result for based homotopy theory.

We next turn to the lifting and cross section problems.
Consider the lifting problem:
E
X
B
❄
p
✲
f
p p p p p p p p✒
g
where p : E →B is a ﬁbration. Note that if f = IdB, then the lifting
problem is the same as constructing a cross section of p.
Suppose g has been deﬁned over the n-skeleton of X. Given an (n + 1)-
cell en+1 of X, the composite of the attaching map and g gives a map
Sn →X
g−→E. The composite Sn →X
g−→E
p−→B is null homotopic since
it equals Sn →X
f−→B, which extends over the cell en+1 →X.
The homotopy lifting property of ﬁbrations implies that the composite
Sn →X
g−→E
is homotopic to a map Sn →F, by lifting the null-homotopy in the base
(cf. Corollary 6.44).
Thus, to each (n+1)-cell of X we have deﬁned, in a highly non-canonical
way, a map Sn →F. We would like to say that this deﬁnes a cochain on X
with values in πnF.
If we assume F is n-simple, so that πnF = [Sn, F] (unbased maps) then
any map Sn →F deﬁnes an element in πnF.
However, if π1B ̸= 0, then some ambiguity remains, namely it was not
necessary that f preserved base points, and hence, even if F is n-simple, we
do not obtain a cochain in Cn(X; πnF). However, one does get a cochain
with local coeﬃcients. Thus obstruction theory for ﬁbrations requires the
use of cohomology with local coeﬃcients, as we will now see.
Recall from Proposition 6.62 that if F is n-simple, then the ﬁbration
F →E →B deﬁnes a local coeﬃcient system over B with ﬁber πnF. In fact
Proposition 6.62 shows how to associate to each α ∈π1B a homotopy class
hα of self-homotopy equivalences of F. Then hα induces an automorphism
of [Sn, F] by f →hα◦f. Since we are assuming F is n-simple, [Sn, F] = πnF
and so this shows how the ﬁbration determines a representation ρ : π1B →
Aut(πnF).
Now pull back this local coeﬃcient system over X via f : X →B to
obtain a local coeﬃcient system over X. We continue to call it ρ, so
ρ : π1X

−→π1B
ρ−→Aut(πn(F)).

With these hypotheses, one obtains an obstruction cocycle
θn+1(g) ∈Cn+1(X; πn(F)ρ) = HomZ[π1X](Cn+1( 
X), πn(F)ρ).
One then can prove the following theorem.
Theorem 7.37. Let X be a CW-complex, p : E →B be a ﬁbration with
ﬁber F. Let f : X →B be a map and g : Xn →E a lift of f on the
n-skeleton.
If F is n-simple, then an obstruction class
[θn+1(g)] ∈Hn+1(X; πn(F)ρ)
is deﬁned.
If [θn+1(g)] vanishes, then g can be redeﬁned over the n-skeleton (rel the
(n −1)-skeleton), then extended over the (n + 1)-skeleton Xn+1.
If the local coeﬃcient system is trivial, for example if π1X = 0 or π1B =
0, then [θn+1(g)] ∈Hn+1(X; πnF) (untwisted coeﬃcients). If π1F = 0, then
F is k-simple for all k, so that the hypotheses of Theorem 7.37 hold.
If πkF = 0 for k ≤n −1, then [θn+1(g)] ∈Hn+1(X; πnFρ) is called the
primary obstruction to lifting f, and is well-deﬁned, i.e.
1. a lift over the n-skeleton always exists, and
2. [θn+1(g)] is independent of the choice of lift to the n-skeleton.
Henceforth we write γn+1(f) for the primary obstruction to lifting f.
The proof of Theorem 7.37 is in many ways similar to the proofs given
earlier. In certain important cases one can reduce this theorem to a special
case of the extension problem by the following useful device.
Suppose there is a ﬁbration E →B, so that the ﬁber can be “delooped”
in the following sense. Namely there exists a ﬁbration q : B →Z with ﬁber
E′ so that the inclusion E′ →B is equivalent to the ﬁbration E →B. Then
we have seen that F is homotopy equivalent to the loop space ΩZ, and the
sequence
[X, F] →[X, E] →[X, B]
q∗
−→[X, Z]
is exact by Theorem 6.42.
This sequence shows that f : X →B can be lifted to g : X →E if and
only if q∗[f] is nullhomotopic. Thus the problem of lifting f is equivalent to
the problem of nullhomotoping q ◦f.
As was explained above, there are obstructions
dk(q ◦f, ∗) ∈Hk(X; πk(Z))
to nullhomotoping q ◦f (provided Z is simple, etc.). But since
πk(Z) = πk−1(ΩZ) = πk−1F,

7.11. Characteristic classes
191
we can view dk(q ◦f, ∗) as an element of Hk(X; πk−1F). Thus the obstruc-
tions to ﬁnding cross sections are in this special case obtainable from the
homotopy obstruction theorem.
This point of view works if E →B is, say, a principal G bundle, since
one can take Z to be the classifying space BG.
7.11. Characteristic classes
One application of obstruction theory is to deﬁne characteristic classes. For
example, suppose p : E →B is an oriented n-plane vector bundle, i.e. a bun-
dle with ﬁber Rn and structure group GL+
n (R), the group of automorphisms
of Rn with positive determinant. Then the Euler class e(p) ∈Hn(B; Z) is
the primary obstruction to ﬁnding a section of the bundle
Rn −{0} →E0 →B
where E0 = E −i(B) is E minus the zero section.
Exercise 124. The primary obstruction to ﬁnding a cross section of E0 →
B lies in Hn(B; πn−1(Rn −{0})). Show that Rn −{0} is n-simple, that
πn−1(Rn −{0}) = Z, and that π1B acts trivially on πn−1(Rn −{0}), i.e.
the local coeﬃcient system is trivial (this uses the fact that the bundle is
orientable).
In other words the Euler class is the primary obstruction to ﬁnding
a nowhere zero section of p.
The Euler class is a characteristic class in
the sense that given a map of oriented n-plane vector bundles which is an
isomorphism on ﬁbers

then
f∗e(p) = e(p′)
If B is a CW-complex of dimension n, then the primary obstruction is the
only obstruction, so there is a nowhere zero section if and only if the Euler
class is zero.
The Euler class is related to the Euler characteristic of a
manifold by the following theorem (see [30]).
Theorem 7.38. If p : TB →B is the tangent bundle of a closed, oriented
n-manifold, then
⟨e(p), [B]⟩= χ(B).

Corollary 7.39 (Poincar´e–Hopf theorem). A closed, oriented n-manifold
has a nowhere-zero vector ﬁeld if and only if its Euler characteristic is zero.
For example, you can’t comb the hairy ball!
The mod 2 reduction of the Euler class of an Rn-vector bundle E →B
is called the nth Stiefel–Whitney class wn(E) ∈Hn(B; Z/2).
There are many other aspects of obstruction theory, for example the
analogue of the homotopy problem in this setting is the problem of ﬁnding
vertical homotopies between two cross sections. There are obstructions
dn(g, g1) ∈Hn(X; πn(F)ρ).
Here are a few more examples to ponder.
Exercise 125. When we studied the extension problem, we did not come
across local coeﬃcient systems. This is because we assumed that Y was
n-simple. Use Theorem 7.37 stated above together with the inverse of the
delooping method outlined above to ﬁnd a statement of a theorem about
obstructions to extending maps into non-simple spaces.
Exercise 126. Write down a careful statement of a theorem about the ob-
struction to ﬁnding vertical homotopies between cross sections of a ﬁbration.

7.12.1. Postnikov systems. The decomposition of a CW-complex into
its skeleta has a “dual” construction leading to Postnikov decompositions of
a space. The word “dual” here is used in the same sense that coﬁbrations
and ﬁbrations are dual. The building blocks for CW-complexes are cells
(Dn, Sn−1). These have homology Z in dimension n and zero in other dimen-
sions. The building blocks for Postnikov decompositions are the Eilenberg-
MacLane spaces K(π, n). For CW-complexes, the attaching maps describe
how the cells are put together. For Postnikov decompositions, spaces are
described as iterated ﬁbrations with ﬁbers Eilenberg-Maclane spaces and
the primary obstruction to ﬁnding cross sections determine how the space
is to assembled from its K(π, n)s.
For this project, show how to construct a Postnikov tower for a space
X.

commute for each n.
For each n, the map pn : Xn →Xn−1 is a ﬁbration with ﬁber the
Eilenberg-MacLane space K(πn(X), n). Moreover, πk(Xn) = 0 for k > n
and (fn)∗: πk(X) →πk(Xn) is an isomorphism for all k ≤n.
To avoid complications you may assume that X is simply connected.
Each ﬁbration in the tower pn : Xn →Xn−1 has ﬁber K(πn(X), n), and
so there is a single obstruction (i.e. the primary obstruction) to ﬁnding a
cross section which lies in
Hn+1(Xn−1; πn(K(πn(X), n))) = Hn+1(Xn−1; πnX).
This obstruction is called the (n+1)st k-invariant of X and is denoted by
kn+1. Using the identiﬁcation Hn+1(Xn−1; πnX) = [Xn−1, K(πn, n + 1)],
kn+1 can be thought of a homotopy class of maps Xn−1 →K(πn, n + 1) so
that the ﬁbration K(πn, n) →Xn →Xn−1 is the pullback of the path space
ﬁbration K(πn, n) →P →K(πn, n + 1) via kn+1.
Thus to a (simple) path connected space X this construction associates
a collection {πn, Xn, pn, kn} where
1. πn is an abelian group.
2. X0 is contractible.
3. pn : Xn →Xn−1 is a ﬁbration with ﬁber K(πn, n).
4. kn ∈Hn(Xn−1; πn−1) classiﬁes pn−1.
5. The inclusion of the ﬁber induces an isomorphism πn(K(πn, n)) →
πn(Xn).
This collection has the property that πn = πn(X).
This collection of data is called the Postnikov system or Postnikov de-
composition for X.

Chapter 8
Bordism, Spectra, and
Generalized Homology
This chapter contains a mixture of algebraic and diﬀerential topology and
serves as an introduction to generalized homology theories. We will give a
precise deﬁnition of a generalized homology theory later, but in the mean-
time you should think of a generalized homology theory as a functor from
pairs of spaces to graded abelian groups (or graded R-modules) satisfying
all Eilenberg–Steenrod axioms but the dimension axiom.
The material in this chapter will draw on the basic notions and theo-
rems of diﬀerential topology, and you should re-familiarize yourself with the
notion of smooth maps between smooth manifolds, submanifolds, tangent
bundles, orientation of a vector bundle, the normal bundle of a submanifold,
the Sard theorem, transversality and the tubular neighborhood theorem.
One of the projects for this chapter is to prepare a lecture on these topics.
A good reference for this material is Hirsch’s book [16]; more elementary
references include [27] and [15].
In this chapter (in contrast to the rest of this book), the word “mani-
fold” will mean a compact, smooth manifold with or without boundary and
a submanifold V ⊂M will mean a compact submanifold whose boundary is
contained in the boundary of M in such a way that V meets the boundary
of M transversely. The normal bundle of a submanifold i : V →M is the
quotient bundle i∗(TM)/TV , and we will use the notation ν(V →M) or
ν(i). If M is a submanifold of Rn, or more generally if M has a Riemann-
ian metric, then the normal bundle ν(V →M) can be identiﬁed with the
subbundle of TM|V consisting of all tangent vectors in TpM which are per-
pendicular to TpV , where p ∈V . A tubular neighborhood of a submanifold

is a tubular neighborhood of V .
8.1. Framed bordism and homotopy groups of
spheres
Pontrjagin and Thom in the 1950’s noted that in many situations there is
a one-to-one correspondence between problems in geometric topology (=
manifold theory) and problems in algebraic topology. Usually the algebraic
problem is more tractable, and its solution leads to geometric consequences.
In this section we discuss the quintessential example of this correspondence;
a reference is the last section of Milnor’s beautiful little book [27].
We start with an informal discussion of the passage from geometric topol-
ogy to algebraic topology.
Deﬁnition 8.1. A framing of a submanifold V k−n of a closed manifold
Mk is a embedding φ of V × Rn in M so that φ(p, 0) = p for all p ∈V .
If (W k+1−n, ψ) is a framed submanifold of M × I, then the two framed
submanifolds of M given by intersecting W with M × {0} and M × {1}
are framed bordant. Let Ωfr
k−n,M be the set of framed bordism classes of
(k −n)-dimensional framed submanifolds of M.
A framed submanifold deﬁnes a collapse map M →Sn = Rn ∪{∞}
by sending φ(p, v) to v and all points outside the image of φ to ∞. Note
that 0 ∈Sn is a regular value and the inverse image of 0 is V . A framed
bordism gives a homotopy of the two collapse maps. A framed bordism from
a framed submanifold to the empty set is a null-bordism. In the special case
of a framed submanifold V k−n of Sk, a null-bordism is given by an extension
to a framed submanifold W k+1−n of Dk+1.
Theorem 8.2. The collapse map induces a bijection Ωfr
k−n,M →[M, Sn].
This method of translating between bordism and homotopy sets is called
the Pontrjagin–Thom construction.
Here are some examples (without proof) to help your geometric insight.
A (framed) point in a Sk gives a map Sk →Sk which generates πkSk ∼= Z.
Any framed circle in S2 is null-bordant, for example the equator with the
obvious framing is the boundary of the 2-disk in the 3-ball. However, a
framed S1 in S3 so that the circle φ(S1 × {(1, 0)}) links the S1 with linking
number 1 represents the generator of π3(S2) ∼= Z. (Can you reinterpret
this in terms of the Hopf map? Why can’t one see the complexities of knot
theory in framed bordism?) Now S3 is naturally framed in S4, S4 in S5, etc.

8.1. Framed bordism and homotopy groups of spheres
197
so we can suspend the linking number 1 framing of S1 in S3 to get a framing
of S1 in Sk+1 for k > 2. This represents the generator of πk+1Sk ∼= Z2.
More generally, one can produce examples of framed manifolds by twist-
ing and suspending. If (V k−n, φ) is a framed submanifold of Mk and α : V →
O(n), then the twist is the framed submanifold (V, φ.α) where φ.α(p, v) =
φ(p, α(p)v). The framed bordism class depends only on (V, φ) and the ho-
motopy class of α. (See Exercise 132 below for more on this construction.)
Next if (V k−n, φ) is a framed submanifold of Sk, then the suspension of
(V k−n, φ) is the framed submanifold (V k−n, Sφ) of Sk+1 is deﬁned using
the obvious framing of Sk in Sk+1, with Sk × R>0 mapping to the upper
hemisphere of Sk+1. Then the generator of π3(S2) mentioned earlier can be
described by ﬁrst suspending the inclusion of a framed circle in the 2-sphere,
and then twisting by the inclusion of the circle in O(2).
To prove Theorem 8.2 we ﬁrst want to reinterpret Ωfr
k−n,M in terms of
normal framings. The key observation is that a framed submanifold deter-
mines n linearly independent normal vector ﬁelds on M.
Deﬁnition 8.3.
1. A trivialization of a vector bundle p : E →B with ﬁber Rn is a
collection {σi : B →E}n
i=1 of sections which form a basis pointwise.
Thus {σ1(b), . . . , σn(b)} is linearly independent and spans the ﬁber
Eb for each b ∈B.
Equivalently, a trivialization is a speciﬁc bundle isomorphism E ∼=
B × Rn. A trivialization is also the same as a choice of section of the
associated principal frame bundle.
2. A framing of a vector bundle is a homotopy class of trivializations,
where two trivializations are called homotopic if there is a continuous
1-parameter family of trivializations joining them. In terms of the
associated frame bundle this says the two sections are homotopic in
the space of sections of the frame bundle.
A section of a normal bundle is called a normal vector ﬁeld.
Deﬁnition 8.4. A normal framing of a submanifold V of M is a homotopy
class of trivializations of the normal bundle ν(V →M). If W is a normally
framed submanifold of M ×I, then the two normally framed submanifolds of
M given by intersecting W with M × {0} and M × {1} are normally framed
bordant. (You should convince yourself that restriction of ν(W →M × I)
to V0 = (M × {0}) ∩W is canonically identiﬁed with ν(V0 →M)).
Exercise 127. Show that a framed submanifold (V, φ) of M determines a
normal framing of V in M. Use notation from diﬀerential geometry and
denote the standard coordinate vector ﬁelds on Rn by {∂/∂x1, . . . , ∂/∂xn}.

8. Bordism, Spectra, and Generalized Homology
Exercise 128. Deﬁne a map from the set of bordism classes of (k −n)-
dimensional framed submanifolds of M to the set of bordism classes of
(k −n)-dimensional normally framed submanifolds of M and show it is
a bijection. (The existence part of the tubular neighborhood theorem will
show the map is surjective, while the uniqueness part will show the map is
injective.)
Henceforth we let Ωfr
k−n,M denote both the bordism classes of framed
submanifolds and the bordism classes of normally framed submanifolds of
M.
Proof of Theorem 8.2. To deﬁne an inverse
d : [M, Sn] →Ωfr
k−n,M
to the collapse map
c : Ωfr
k−n,M →[M, Sn]
one must use diﬀerential topology; in fact, this was the original motivation
for the development of transversality.
Any element of [M, Sn] can be represented by a map f : M →Sn =
Rn ∪{∞}, which is smooth in a neighborhood of f−1(0) and transverse to
0 (i.e. 0 is a regular value). Thus:
1. The inverse image f−1(0) = V is a smooth submanifold of Mk of
codimension n (i.e. of dimension k −n), and
2. The diﬀerential of f identiﬁes the normal bundle of V in Mk with
the pullback of the normal bundle of 0 ∈Sn via f. More precisely,
the diﬀerential of f, df : TMk →TSn restricts to TMk|V and factors
through the quotient ν(V →Mk) to give a map of vector bundles

The map d is deﬁned by sending [f] to f−1(0) with the above framing.
To see that d is well-deﬁned, consider a homotopy
F : M × I →Sn.
where F|M×{0,1} is transverse to 0 ∈Sn. Consider the “trace of F”
ˆF : M × I →Sn × I
(m, t) →(F(m, t), t),
which has the advantage that it takes boundary points to boundary points.
The (relative) transversality approximation theorem says that ˆF is homo-
topic (rel M × {0, 1}) to a map transverse to 0 × I. The inverse image of
0×I equipped with an appropriate normal framing gives a normally framed
bordism between F|−1
M×{0}(0) and F|−1
M×{1}(0).
Our ﬁnal task is to show that c and d are mutual inverses. It is easy
to see that d ◦c is the identity, but to show c ◦d is the identity takes some
work. First represent an element of [M, Sn] by a a map f transverse to
0 ∈Rn ∪{∞} = Sn. It seems plausible that the collapse map associated to
V = f−1(0) with the normal framing induced by df is homotopic to f, but
there are technical details.
Here goes. Let ν = ν(V →M), let g : ν →M be a tubular neighbor-
hood of V , assume ν has a metric, and let D = g(D(ν)) correspond to the
disk bundle. Deﬁne Φ : ν →Rn by Φ(x) = limt→0 t−1f(g(tx)). Then Φ(x)

is the velocity vector of a curve, and by the chain rule Φ is the composite of
the identiﬁcation of ν with ν(V →ν) and df ◦dg. In particular Φ gives an
isomorphism from each ﬁber of ν to Rn.
There is a homotopy ft : D →Rn ∪{∞} for −1 ≤t ≤1 given by
ft(g(x)) =

if −1 ≤t ≤0,
t−1f(g(tx))

We now have a map

deﬁned by ft on the ﬁrst piece, by f on the second piece, and by the constant
map at inﬁnity on the third piece. This extends to a map (M −Int D) ×
[−1, 1] →Sn −{0} by the Tietze extension theorem.
We can then paste back in ft to get a homotopy
F : M × [−1, 1] →Sn
from our original f to a map h so that
h−1Rn = Int D ∼= V × Rn
where the diﬀeomorphism ∼=
is deﬁned by mapping to V by using the
original tubular neighborhood and by mapping to Rn by h. Thus f ≃h
where h is in the image of c. It follows that c is surjective and thus that c
and d are mutual inverses.
In reading the above proof you need either a fair amount of technical
skill to ﬁll in the details or you need to be credulous.
For an alternate
approach see [27, Chapter 7].
For a real vector bundle over a point, i.e. a vector space, a framing is the
same as a choice of orientation of the vector space, since GL(n, R) has two
path components. Thus a normal framing of V ⊂Sk induces an orientation
on the normal bundle ν(V →Sk). (See Section 10.7 for more information
about orientation.)
Exercise 129. Let V be a normally framed submanifold of a manifold M.
Show that an orientation on M induces an orientation on V . (Hint: consider
the isomorphism TV ⊕ν = TM|V .)
Theorem 8.5 (Hopf degree theorem). Let Mk
be a connected,
closed,
smooth manifold.
1. If Mk is orientable, then two maps Mk →Sk are homotopic if and
only if they have the same degree.
2. If Mk is nonorientable, then two maps Mk →Sk are homotopic if
and only if they have the same degree mod 2.

8.1. Framed bordism and homotopy groups of spheres
201
Exercise 130. Prove the Hopf degree theorem in two ways: obstruction
theory and framed bordism.
The function πkSn →[Sk, Sn] obtained by forgetting base points is a
bijection. For n > 1 this follows from the fact that Sn is simply connected
and so vacuously the fundamental group acts trivially. For n = 1 this is still
true because πkS1 is trivial for k > 1 and abelian for k = 1.
The result that πnSn ∼= Z is a nontrivial result in algebraic topology; it
is cool that this can be proven using diﬀerential topology.
Exercise 131. We only showed that the isomorphism of Theorem 8.2 is
a bijection of sets. However, since πkSn is an abelian group, the framed
bordism classes inherit an abelian group structure. Prove that this group
structure on framed bordism is given by taking the disjoint union:
[V0] + [V1] := V0 ⨿V1 ⊂Sk#Sk ∼= Sk
with negatives given by changing the orientation of the framing (e.g. replac-
ing te ﬁrst vector ﬁeld in the framing by its negative)
−[V0] = [−V0].
We will generalize Theorem 8.2 by considering the eﬀect of the sus-
pension map S : πkSn →πk+1Sn+1 and eventually passing to the limit
lim
ℓ→∞πk+ℓSn+ℓ.
This has the eﬀect of eliminating the thorny embedding
questions of submanifolds in Sk; in the end we will be able to work with
abstract framed manifolds V without reference to an embedding of V in
some sphere.
Exercise 132. (The J-homomorphism) Let V k−n ⊂Mk be a non-empty
normally framed manifold. Use twisting to deﬁne a function
J : [V k−n, O(n)] →[Mk, Sn].
Now let V be the equatorial Sk−n ⊂Sk with the canonical framing coming
from the inclusions Sk−n ⊂Sk−n+1 ⊂· · · ⊂Sk, and show that the function
J : πk−n(O(n)) →πkSn
is a homomorphism provided k > n. It is called the J-homomorphism and
can be used to construct interesting elements in πkSn.
Draw an explicit picture of a framed circle in R3 = S3−{∞} representing
J(ι) where ι ∈π1O(2) = Z is the generator.

8. Bordism, Spectra, and Generalized Homology
8.2. Suspension and the Freudenthal theorem
Recall that the (reduced) suspension of a space X ∈K∗with nondegenerate
basepoint is the space
SX = X × I/ ∼
where the subspace (x0 × I) ∪(X × {0, 1}) is collapsed to a point. This
construction is functorial with respect to based maps f : X →Y .
In
particular, the suspension deﬁnes a function
S : [X, Y ]0 →[SX, SY ]0.
By Proposition 6.35, SSk = Sk+1, so that when X = Sk, the suspension
deﬁnes a function, in fact a homomorphism
S : πk(Y ) →πk+1(SY )
for any space Y . Taking Y to be a sphere one obtains
S : πk(Sn) →πk+1(Sn+1).
We next identify Sk ⊂Sk+1 = SSk as the equator, and similarly Sn ⊂Sn+1,
and interpret the above map in terms of framed bordism.
If f : Sk →Sn is smooth, then the suspension
Sf : Sk+1 →Sn+1
is smooth away from the base points. If x ∈Sn is a regular value diﬀerent
from the base point, and V = f−1(x) is the normally framed submanifold
of Sk associated to f, then clearly
V = (Sf)−1(x) ⊂Sk ⊂Sk+1.
Let us compare normal bundles and normal framings.
ν(V →Sk+1)
=
ν(V →Sk) ⊕ν(Sk →Sk+1)|V
=
ν(V →Sk) ⊕εV
where εV = V × R = trivial line bundle.
Similarly, ν(x →Sn+1) = ν(x →Sn) ⊕ε{x}, and the diﬀerential of Sf
preserves the trivial factor, since, locally (near the equator Sk ⊂Sk+1),
Sf ∼= f × Id : Sk × (−ϵ, ϵ) →Sn × (−ϵ, ϵ).
We have shown the following.
Theorem 8.6. Taking the suspension of a map corresponds, via the
Pontrjagin-Thom construction, to the same manifold V , but embedded in
the equator Sk ⊂Sk+1, and with normal framing the direct sum of the old
normal framing and the trivial 1-dimensional framing.

8.2. Suspension and the Freudenthal theorem
203
Now consider the eﬀect of multiple suspensions.
Sℓ: πkSn →πk+ℓSn+ℓ
For each suspension, the eﬀect on the normally framed submanifold V is
to replace it by the same manifold embedded in the equator, with the new
normal framing νnew = νold ⊕εV . Thus after ℓsuspensions,
νnew = νold ⊕εℓ
V .
The following fundamental result is the starting point for the investiga-
tion of “stable” phenomena in homotopy theory. We will not give a proof
at this time, since a spectral sequence proof is the easiest way to go. The
proof is given in Section 10.3.
Theorem 8.7 (Freudenthal suspension theorem). Suppose that X is an
(n −1)–connected space (n ≥2). Then the suspension homomorphism
S : πkX →πk+1SX
is an isomorphism if k < 2n −1 and an epimorphism if k = 2n −1.
The most important case is when X = Sn, and here the Freudenthal
suspension theorem can also be given a diﬀerential topology proof using
framed bordism and the facts that any j-manifold embeds in Sn for n ≥
2j + 1, uniquely up to isotopy if n ≥2j + 2, and that any embedding of a
j-manifold in Sn+1 is isotopic to an embedding in Sn if n ≥2j + 1.
Exercise 133. Show that for any k-dimensional CW-complex X and for
any (n −1)-connected space Y (n ≥2) the suspension map
[X, Y ]0 →[SX, SY ]0
is bijective if k < 2n−1 and surjective if k = 2n−1. (Hint: Instead consider
the map [X, Y ]0 →[X, ΩSY ]0. Convert the map Y →ΩSY to a ﬁbration
and apply cross-section obstruction theory as well as the Freudenthal sus-
pension theorem.)
For a based space X, πnX = [X, Sn]0 is called the n-th cohomotopy set.
If X is a CW-complex with dim X < 2n −1, then Exercise 133 implies
that πnX is a group, with group structure given by suspending and using
the suspension coordinate in SX. The reader might ponder the geometric
meaning (framed bordism) of the cohomotopy group structure when X is a
manifold.
Deﬁnition 8.8. The k-th stable homotopy group of a based space X is the
limit
πS
k X = lim
ℓ→∞πk+ℓSℓX.

204
8. Bordism, Spectra, and Generalized Homology
The stable k-stem is
πS
k = πS
k S0.
The computation of the stable k-stem for all k is the holy grail of the
ﬁeld of homotopy theory.
The Hurewicz theorem implies that if X is (n −1)-connected, then SX
is n-connected, since HℓSX = Hℓ−1X = 0 if ℓ≤n and π1SX = 0 if X
is path connected. The following corollary follows from this fact and the
Freudenthal theorem.
Corollary 8.9. If X is path connected,
πS
k X = π2k(SkX) = πk+ℓ(SℓX)
for ℓ≥k.
For the stable k-stem,
πS
k = π2k+2(Sk+2) = πk+ℓ(Sℓ)
for ℓ≥k + 2.
Recall from Equation (6.3) that πk(O(n −1)) →πk(O(n)), induced by
the inclusion O(n −1) →O(n), is an isomorphism for k < n −2, and
therefore letting O = limn→∞O(n), πkO = πk(O(n)) for k < n −2. It
follows from the deﬁnitions that the following diagram commutes
πk(O(n −1))
πk+n−1(Sn−1)

with the horizontal maps the J-homomorphisms, the left vertical map in-
duced by the inclusion, and the right vertical map the suspension homomor-
phism. If k < n −2, then both vertical maps are isomorphisms, and so one
obtains the stable J-homomorphism
J : πk(O) →πS
k .
Corollary 8.10. The Pontrjagin-Thom construction deﬁnes an isomorphism
from πS
k to the normally framed bordism classes of normally framed k-
dimensional closed submanifolds of Sn for any n ≥2k + 2.
8.3. Stable tangential framings
We wish to remove the restriction that our normally framed manifolds be
submanifolds of Sn. To this end we need to eliminate the reference to the
normal bundle. This turns out to be easy and corresponds to the fact that
the normal and tangent bundles of a submanifold of Sn are inverses in a

8.3. Stable tangential framings
205
certain stable sense. Since the tangent bundle is an intrinsic invariant of
a smooth manifold, and so is deﬁned independently of any embedding in
Sk, this will enable us to replace normal framings with tangential framings.
On the homotopy level, however, we will need to take suspensions when
describing in what way the bundles are inverses. In the end this means that
we will obtain an isomorphism between stably tangentially framed bordism
classes and stable homotopy groups.
In what follows, εj will denote a trivialized j-dimensional real bundle
over a space.
Lemma 8.11. Let V k ⊂Sn be a closed, oriented, normally framed sub-
manifold of Sn. Then
1. A normal framing γ : ν(V →Sn) ∼= εn−k induces a trivialization
γ : TV ⊕εn−k+1 ∼= εn+1.
2. A trivialization γ : TV ⊕ε ∼= εk+1 induces a trivialization
ν(V →Sn) ⊕εk+1 ∼= εn+1.
Proof. The inclusion Sn ⊂Rn+1 has a trivial 1-dimensional normal bundle
which can be framed by choosing the outward unit normal as a basis. This
shows that the once stabilized tangent bundle of Sn is canonically trivialized
TSn ⊕ε ∼= εn+1
since the tangent bundle of Rn+1 is canonically trivialized.
There is a canonical decomposition
(TSn ⊕ε)|V = ν(V →Sn) ⊕TV ⊕ε.
Using the trivialization of TSn ⊕ε, one has a canonical isomorphism
εn+1 ∼= ν(V →Sn) ⊕TV ⊕ε.
Thus a normal framing γ : ν(V →Sk) ∼= εn−k induces an isomorphism
εn+1 ∼= εn−k ⊕TV ⊕ε,
and, conversely a trivialization γ : TV ⊕ε ∼= εk+1 induces an isomorphism
εn+1 ∼= ν(V →Sn) ⊕εk+1.
Deﬁnition 8.12. A stable (tangential) framing of an k-dimensional mani-
fold V is an equivalence class of trivializations of
TV ⊕εn
where εn is the trivial bundle V × Rn. Two trivializations
t1 : TV ⊕εn1 ∼= εk+n1,
t2 : TV ⊕εn2 ∼= εk+n2

206
8. Bordism, Spectra, and Generalized Homology
are considered equivalent if there exists some N greater than n1 and n2 such
that the direct sum trivializations
t1 ⊕Id : TV ⊕εn1 ⊕εN−n1 ∼= εk+n1 ⊕εN−n1 = εk+N
and
t2 ⊕Id : TV ⊕εn2 ⊕εN−n2 ∼= εk+n2 ⊕εN−n2 = εk+N
are homotopic.
Similarly, a stable normal framing of a submanifold V of Sℓis an equiv-
alence class of trivializations of ν(V →Sℓ) ⊕εn and a stable framing of a
bundle η is an equivalence class of trivializations of η ⊕εn.
A tangential framing is easier to work with than a normal framing, since
one does not need to refer to an embedding V ⊂Sn to deﬁne a tangential
framing. However, stable normal framings and stable tangential framings
are equivalent; essentially because the tangent bundle of Sn is canonically
stably framed. Lemma 8.11 generalizes to give the following theorem.
Theorem 8.13. There is a 1-1 correspondence between stable tangential
framings and stable normal framings of a manifold V . More precisely:
1. Let i : V →Sn be an embedding. A stable framing of TV determines
stable framing of ν(i) and conversely.
2. Let
i1 : V →Sn1 and i2 : V →Sn2 be embeddings. For n large
enough there exists a canonical (up to homotopy) identiﬁcation
ν(i1) ⊕εn−n1 ∼= ν(i2) ⊕εn−n2.
A stable framing of ν(i1) determines one of ν(i2) and vice versa.
Proof. 1. The proof of Lemma 8.11 gives a canonical identiﬁcation
ν(V →Sn) ⊕εℓ⊕TV ∼= εn+ℓ
for all ℓ> 0. Associativity of ⊕shows stable framings of the normal bundle
and tangent bundles coincide.
2. Let
i1 : V →Sn1 and i2 : V →Sn2 be embeddings. There is a
formal proof that stable framings of ν(i1) and ν(i2) coincide. Namely, a
stable framing of ν(i1) determines a stable framing of TV by part 1, which
in turn determines a stable framing of ν(i2). However, the full statement of
part 2 applies to submanifolds with non-trivial normal bundle, and theorems
from diﬀerential topology must be used.
Choose n large enough so that any two embeddings of V in Sn are
isotopic. (Transversality theorems imply that n > 2k + 1 suﬃces.)

8.3. Stable tangential framings
207
The composite V
i1
−→Sn1
j1
−→Sn, with Sn1
j1
−→Sn the equatorial embed-
ding, has normal bundle
ν(j1 ◦i1) = ν(i1) ⊕εn−n1.
Similarly, the composite V
i2
−→Sn2
j2
−→Sn has normal bundle
ν(j2 ◦i2) = ν(i2) ⊕εn−n2.
Then j2 ◦i2 is isotopic to j1 ◦i1, and the isotopy induces an isomorphism
ν(j2 ◦i2) ∼= ν(j1 ◦i1).
If n > 2(k + 1) + 1, then any self-isotopy is isotopic to the constant
isotopy, so that the identiﬁcation ν(j2 ◦i2) ∼= ν(j1 ◦i1) is canonical (up to
homotopy).
Deﬁnition 8.14. Two real vector bundles E, F over V are called stably
equivalent if there exists non-negative integers i, j so that E ⊕εi and F ⊕εj
are isomorphic.
Since every smooth compact manifold embeds in Sn for some n, the
second part of Theorem 8.13 has the consequence that the stable normal
bundle (i.e.
the stable equivalence class of the normal bundle for some
embedding) is a well deﬁned invariant of a smooth manifold, independent of
the embedding, just as the tangent bundle is. However, something stronger
holds. If ν(i1) and ν(i2) are normal bundles of two diﬀerent embeddings of
a manifold in a sphere, then not only are ν(i1) and ν(i2) stably equivalent,
but the stable isomorphism is determined up to homotopy.
Returning to bordism, we see that the inclusion Sn ⊂Sn+1 sets up a
correspondence between the suspension operation and stabilizing a normal
(or equivalently tangential) framing. Consequently Corollary 8.10 can be
restated as follows.
Corollary 8.15. The stable k-stem πS
k
is isomorphic to the stably tan-
gentially framed bordism classes of stably tangentially framed k-dimensional
smooth, oriented compact manifolds without boundary.
This statement is more appealing since it refers to k-dimensional mani-
folds intrinsically, without reference to an embedding in some Sn.
Here is a list of some computations of stable homotopy groups of spheres
for you to reﬂect on. (Note: πS
k has been computed for k ≤64. There is no
reasonable conjecture for πS
k for general k, although there are many results
known. For example, in Chapter 10, we will show that the groups are ﬁnite
for k > 0; πS
0 = Z by the Hopf degree theorem.)

The reference [32] is a good source for the tools to compute πS
k .
We will give stably framed manifolds representing generators of πS
k for
k < 9; you may challenge your local homotopy theorist to supply the proofs.
In this range there are (basically) two sources of framed manifolds: normal
framings on spheres coming from the image of the stable J-homomorphism
J : πk(O) →πS
k , and tangential framing coming from Lie groups. There is
considerable overlap between these sources.
Bott periodicity (Theorem 6.49) computes πk(O).

Then J : πkO →πS
k is an isomorphism for k = 1, an epimorphism for

Another source for framed manifolds are Lie groups. If G is a compact
k-dimensional Lie group and TeG ∼= Rk is an identiﬁcation of its tangent
space at the identity, then one can use the group multiplication to identify
TG ∼= G×Rk and thereby frame the tangent bundle. This is the so-called Lie
invariant framing. The generators of the cyclic groups πS
0 , πS
1 , πS
2 , πS
3 , πS
6 , πS
7
are given by e, S1, S1 × S1, S3, S3 × S3, S7 with invariant framings. (The
unit octonions S7 fail to be a group because of the lack of associativity, but
nonetheless, they do have an invariant framing.)
Finally, the generators of πS
8 are given by S8 with framing given by the
J-homomorphism and the unique exotic sphere in dimension 8. (An exotic
sphere is a smooth manifold homeomorphic to a sphere and not diﬀeomor-
phic to a sphere.)

8.3. Stable tangential framings
209
We have given a bordism description of the groups πS
k .
If X is any
space, πS
k X can be given a bordism description also. In this case one adds
the structure of a map from the manifold to X. (A map from a manifold to
a space X is sometimes called a singular manifold in X.)
Deﬁnition 8.16. Let (Vi, γi : TVi ⊕εa ∼= εk+a), i = 0, 1 be two stably
framed k-manifolds and gi : Vi →X, i = 0, 1 two maps.
We say (V0, γ0, g0) is stably framed bordant to (V1, γ1, g1) over X if there
exists a stably framed bordism (W, τ) from (V0, γ0) to (V1, γ1) and a map
G : W →X
extending g0 and g1.
We introduce the notation:
1. Let X+ denote X ⨿pt, the union of X with a disjoint base point.
2. Let Ωfr
k (X) denote the stably framed bordism classes of stably framed
k-manifolds over X.
Since every space maps uniquely to point, and since S0 = pt+, we can
restate Corollary 8.15 in this notation as
Ωfr
k (pt) = πS
k (pt+)
since πS
k = πS
k (S0) = πS
k (pt+).
More generally one can easily prove the following theorem.
Theorem 8.17. Ωfr
k (X) = πS
k (X+).
The proof of this theorem is essentially the same as for X = pt; one just
has to carry the map V →X along for the ride. We give an outline of the
argument and indicate a map πS
k (X+) →Ωfr
k (X).
Sketch of proof. Choose ℓlarge so that πS
k (X+) = πk+ℓ(X+ ∧Sℓ).
The smash product X+ ∧Sℓ= X+ × Sℓ/X+ ∨Sℓ= X × Sℓ/X × pt is
called the half smash of X and Sℓand is depicted in the following picture.

8. Bordism, Spectra, and Generalized Homology
Given f : Sk+ℓ→X+ ∧Sℓ, make f transverse to X × {x}, where x ∈Sℓ
is a point diﬀerent from the base point. (You should think carefully about
what transversality means since X is just a topological space. The point
is that smoothness is only needed in the normal directions, since one can
project to the sphere.)
Then f−1(X × {x}) = V is a smooth, compact manifold, and since a
neighborhood of X ×{x} in X+∧Sℓis homeomorphic to X ×Rℓas indicated
in the following ﬁgure,
X × {x} ⊂X+ ∧Sℓ
the submanifold V has a framed normal bundle, and f|V : V →X×{x} = X.
This procedure shows how to associate a stably framed manifold with a map
to X to a (stable) map f : Sk+ℓ→X+ ∧Sℓ. One can show as before, using
the Pontrjagin-Thom construction, that the induced map πk+ℓ(X+ ∧Sℓ) →
Ωfr
k (X) is an isomorphism.
Exercise 134. Deﬁne the reverse map Ωfr
k (X) →πS
k (X+).
8.4. Spectra
The collection of spheres, {Sn}∞
n=0, together with the maps (in fact homeo-
morphisms)
kn : SSn
∼
=
−→Sn+1
forms a system of spaces and maps from which one can construct the stable
homotopy groups πS
n(X). Another such system is the collection of Eilenberg–
MacLane spaces K(Z, n) from which we can recover the cohomology groups
by the identiﬁcation Hn(X; Z) = [X, K(Z, n)] according the the results of
Chapter 7.
The notion of a spectrum abstracts from these two examples and intro-
duces a category which measures “stable” phenomena, that is, phenomena
which are preserved by suspending. Recall that Hn(X) = Hn+1(SX) and

8.4. Spectra
211
by deﬁnition πS
n(X) = πS
n+1(SX). Thus cohomology and stable homotopy
groups are measuring stable information about a space X.
Deﬁnition 8.18. A spectrum is a sequence of pairs {Kn, kn} where the Kn
are based spaces and kn : SKn →Kn+1 are basepoint preserving maps,
where SKn denotes the suspension.
In Exercise 95 you saw that the the n-fold reduced suspension of SnX of
X is homeomorphic to Sn ∧X. Thus we can rewrite the deﬁnition of stable
homotopy groups as
πS
nX = lim
ℓ→∞πn+ℓ(Sℓ∧X)
where the limit is taken over the homomorphisms
πn+ℓ(Sℓ∧X) →πn+ℓ+1(Sℓ+1 ∧X).
These homomorphisms are composites of the suspension
πn+ℓ(Sℓ∧X) →πn+ℓ+1(S(Sℓ∧X)),
the identiﬁcation S(Sℓ∧X) = S1 ∧(Sℓ∧X) = S(Sℓ) ∧X, and the map
πn+ℓ+1(S(Sℓ) ∧X) →πn+ℓ+1(Sℓ+1 ∧X) induced by the map kℓ: S(Sℓ) →
Sℓ+1.
Thus we see a natural link between the sphere spectrum
S = {Sn, kn : S(Sn) ∼= Sn+1}
and the stable homotopy groups
πS
n(X) = lim
ℓ→∞πn+ℓ(Sℓ∧X).
Another example is provided by ordinary integral homology. The path
space ﬁbration and the long exact sequence in homotopy, shows that the loop
space of the Eilenberg–MacLane space K(Z, n + 1) is homotopy equivalent
to K(Z, n). Fixing a model for K(Z, n) for each n, there exists a sequence
of homotopy equivalences
hn : K(Z, n) →ΩK(Z, n + 1).
Then hn deﬁnes, by taking its adjoint, a map
kn : S(K(Z, n)) →K(Z, n + 1).
In this way we obtain the Eilenberg–MacLane spectrum
K(Z) = {K(Z, n), kn}.
We have seen in Theorem 7.22 that Hn(X; Z) = [X, K(Z, n)].
Ordinary homology and cohomology are derived from the Eilenberg–
MacLane spectrum, as the next theorem indicates. This point of view gen-
eralizes to motivate the deﬁnition of homology and cohomology with respect
to any spectrum.

and veriﬁes the second part of this theorem. The ﬁrst part can be proven by
starting with this fact and using Spanier-Whitehead duality. See the project
on Spanier-Whitehead duality at the end of this chapter.
These two examples and Theorem 8.19 leads to the following deﬁnition.
Recall that X+ denotes the space X with a disjoint base point. In particular,
if A ⊂X, then (X+/A+) = X/A if A is non-empty and equals X+ if A is
empty.

be the functor taking a based space X to the abelian group

and the homology and cohomology of a pair with coeﬃcients in the spectrum
K to be the functor taking a pair of space (X, A) to the abelian group
Hn(X, A; K) = lim
ℓ→∞πn+ℓ((X+/A+) ∧Kℓ)
and
Hn(X, A; K) = lim
ℓ→∞[Sℓ(X+/A+); Kn+ℓ]0,
It is a theorem that these are generalized (co)homology theories; they
satisfy all the Eilenberg–Steenrod axioms except the dimension axiom. We
will discuss this in more detail later.
For example, stable homotopy theory Hn(X; S) = πS
nX is a reduced
homology theory; framed bordism Hn(X; S) = πS
nX+ = Ωfr
n(X) is an unre-
duced homology theory.
Note that Hn(pt; K) can be non-zero for n ̸= 0, for example Hn(pt; S) =
πS
n. Ordinary homology is characterized by the fact that Hn(pt) = 0 for
n ̸= 0, (see Theorem 1.31). The groups Hn(pt; K) are called the coeﬃcients
of the spectrum.
There are many relationships between reduced homology, unreduced ho-
mology, suspension, and homology of pairs, some of which are obvious and
some of which are not. We list some facts for homology.
• For a based space X, Hn(X; K) = Hn+1(SX; K).
• For a space X, Hn(X; K) = Hn(X+; K).
• For a pair of spaces, Hn(X, A; K) ∼= Hn(X/A; K).
• For a CW-pair, Hn(X, A; K) ﬁts into the long exact sequence of a
pair.
8.5. More general bordism theories
(Stably) framed bordism is a special case of a general bordism theory, where
one considers bordisms respecting some speciﬁc stable structure on the nor-
mal bundle of a smooth manifold. We will give examples of stable structures
now, and then ask you to supply a general deﬁnition in Exercise 135. Basi-
cally a property of vector bundles is stable if whenever a bundle η has that
property, then so does η ⊕εk for all k.
8.5.1. Framing. A stable framing on a bundle [η] is, as we have seen, a
choice of homotopy class of bundle isomorphism
γ : η ⊕εk ∼= εn+k
subject to the equivalence relation generated by the requirement that
γ ∼γ ⊕Id : η ⊕εk ⊕ε ∼= εn+k+1.

214
8. Bordism, Spectra, and Generalized Homology
8.5.2. The empty structure. This refers to bundles with no extra struc-
ture.
8.5.3. Orientation. This is weaker than requiring a framing. The most
succinct way to deﬁne an orientation of a n-plane bundle η of is to choose a
homotopy class of trivialization of the highest exterior power of the bundle,
γ : ∧n(η) ∼= ε.
Equivalently, an orientation is a reduction of the structure group to
GL+(n, R), the group of n-by-n matrices with positive determinant.
A
oriented manifold is a manifold with an orientation on its tangent bundle.
Since ∧a+b(V ⊕W) is canonically isomorphic to ∧aV ⊗∧bW if V is a
a-dimensional vector space and W is a b-dimensional vector space, it follows
that ∧n(η) is canonically isomorphic to ∧n+k(η ⊕εk) for any k ≥0. Thus
an orientation on η induces one on η ⊕ε, so an orientation is a well-deﬁned
stable property.
8.5.4. Spin structure. Let Spin(n) →SO(n) be the double cover where
Spin(n) is connected for n > 1. A spin structure on an n-plane bundle η
over a space M is a reduction of the structure group to Spin(n). This is
equivalent to giving a principal Spin(n)-bundle P →M and an isomorphism
η ∼= (P ×Spin(n) Rn →M). A spin manifold is a manifold whose tangent
bundle has a spin structure. Spin structures come up in diﬀerential geometry
and index theory.
The stabilization map SO(n) →SO(n + 1) induces a map Spin(n) →
Spin(n + 1). Thus a principal Spin(n)-bundle P →M induces a principal
Spin(n + 1)-bundle P ×Spin(n) Spin(n + 1) →M, and hence a spin structure
on η gives a spin structure on η ⊕ε. A spin structure is a stable property.
A framing on a bundle gives a spin structure. A spin structure on a
bundle gives an orientation. It turns out that a spin structure is equivalent
to a framing on the 2-skeleton of M.
8.5.5. Stable complex structure. An complex structure on a bundle η
is a bundle map J : η →η so that J ◦J = −Id. This forces the (real)
dimension of η to be even. Equivalently complex structure is a reduction
of the structure group to GL(k, C) ⊂GL(2k, R). The tangent bundle of a
complex manifold admits a complex structure. One calls a manifold with
a complex structure on its tangent bundle an almost complex manifold and
it may or may not admit the structure of a complex manifold. (It can be
shown that S6 is an almost complex manifold, but whether or not S6 is a
complex manifold is still an open question.)

8.5. More general bordism theories
215
One way to deﬁne a stable complex structure on a bundle η is as a section
J ∈Γ(Hom(η ⊕εk, η ⊕εk))
satisfying J2 = −Id in each ﬁber. Given such a J, one can extend it canon-
ically to
J = J ⊕i ∈Γ(Hom(η ⊕εk ⊕ε2ℓ, η ⊕εk ⊕ε2ℓ))
by identifying ε2ℓwith M × Cℓand using multiplication by i to deﬁne
i ∈Γ(Hom(M × Cℓ, M × Cℓ)). As usual, two such structures are identiﬁed
if they are homotopic. Note that odd-dimensional manifolds cannot have
almost complex structures but may have stable almost complex structures.
If γ : η ⊕εk ∼= εℓis a stable framing, up to equivalence we may assume
that ℓis even. Then identifying εℓwith M ×Cℓ/2 induces an stable complex
structure on η ⊕εk.
Thus stably framed bundles have a stable complex
structure.
Similarly, a complex structure determines an orientation, since a com-
plex vector space has a canonical (real) orientation.
To see this, notice
that if {e1, . . . , er} is a complex basis for a complex vector space, then
{e1, ie1, · · · , er, ier} is a real basis whose orientation class is independent
of the choice of the basis {e1, . . . , er}.
The orthogonal group O(n) is a strong deformation retract of the general
linear group GL(n, R); this can be shown using the Gram-Schmidt process.
This leads to a one-to-one correspondence between isomorphism classes of
vector bundles and isomorphism classes of Rn-bundles with structure group
O(n) over a paracompact base space.
An Rn-bundle with a metric has
structure group O(n). Conversely an Rn-bundle with structure group O(n)
over a connected base space admits a metric, uniquely deﬁned up to scaling.
Henceforth in this chapter all bundles will have metrics with orthogonal
structure group.
The following exercise indicates how to deﬁne a structure on a stable
bundle in general.
Exercise 135. Let G = {Gn} be a sequence of topological groups with con-
tinuous homomorphisms Gn →Gn+1 and Gn →O(n) so that the diagram
Gn

Gn+1

.
Use this to deﬁne a stable G-structure on a bundle η. (Hint: either use clas-
sifying spaces or else consider the overlap functions for the stable bundle.)

216
8. Bordism, Spectra, and Generalized Homology
Deﬁne what a homomorphism G →G′ should be in such a way that
a bundle with a stable G-structure becomes a bundle with a stable G′-
structure.
There are many examples of G-structures. As a perhaps unusual ex-
ample, one could take Gn to be O(n) or SO(n) with the discrete topology.
This spectrum arises in the study of ﬂat bundles and algebraic K-theory.
For our previous examples, a framing corresponds to Gn = 1, the trivial
group for all n. The empty structure corresponds to Gn = O(n). An orien-
tation corresponds to Gn = SO(n) ⊂O(n). A spin structure corresponds
to Gn = Spin(n) →SO(n). An stable complex structure corresponds to
Gn = U([n/2]) ⊂O(n).
Concepts such as orientation and almost complex structure are more
natural on the tangent bundle, while the Pontrjagin-Thom construction and
hence bordism naturally deals with the stable normal bundle. The following
exercise generalizes Theorem 8.13 and shows that in some cases one can
translate back and forth.
Exercise 136.
1. Show that an orientation on the stable tangent bundle of a manifold
determines one on the stable normal bundle and conversely.
2. Show that a complex structure on the stable tangent bundle of a
manifold determines one on the stable normal bundle and conversely.
(Hint/discussion: The real point is that the tangent bundle and normal bun-
dle are (stably) Whitney sum inverses, so one may as well consider bundles
α and β over a ﬁnite-dimensional base space with a framing of α ⊕β. A
complex structure on α is classiﬁed a map to Gn(Ck) and β is equivalent
to the pullback of the orthogonal complement of canonical bundle over the
complex grassmannian, and hence β is equipped with a complex structure.
Part 1 could be done using exterior powers or using the grassmannian of
oriented n-planes in Rk.)
Deﬁnition 8.21. Given a G-structure, deﬁne the n-th G-bordism group of
a space X to be the G-bordism classes of n-dimensional closed manifolds
mapping to X with stable G-structures on the normal bundle of an embed-
ding of the manifold in a sphere. Denote this abelian group (with disjoint
union as the group operation) by
ΩG
n (X).
Thus an element of ΩG
n (X) is represented by an embedded closed sub-
manifold Mn ⊂Sk, a continuous map f : M →X, and a stable G-structure
γ on the normal bundle ν(M →Sk). Bordism is the equivalence relation

generated by replacing k by k + 1, and by
(M0 ⊂Sk, f0, γ0) ∼(M1 ⊂Sk, f1, γ1)
provided that there exists a compact manifold W ⊂Sk × I with boundary
M0 × {0} ∪M1 × {1} (which we identify with M0 ⨿M1), a map F : W →X
and a stable G-structure Γ on ν(W →Sk × I) which restricts to (M0 ⨿
M1, f0 ⨿f1, γ0 ⨿γ1).
We previously used the notation Ωfr for framed bordism, i.e. Ωfr = Ω1
where 1 = G = {Gn}, the trivial group for all n.
We next want to associate spectra to bordism theories based on a stable
structure. We have already seen how this works for framed bordism:
Ωfr
n(X) = πS
n(X+) = lim
ℓ→∞πn+ℓ(X+ ∧Sℓ)
i.e. framed bordism corresponds to the sphere spectrum S = {Sn, kn}.
What do the other bordism theories correspond to? Does there exist a
spectrum K for each structure G so that
ΩG
n (X) = Hn(X; K) = lim
ℓ→∞πn+ℓ(X+ ∧Kℓ)?
The answer is yes; the spectra for bordism theories are called Thom spectra
MG. In particular, one can deﬁne G-cobordism by taking
Hn(X; MG) = lim
ℓ→∞[SℓX+; MGn+ℓ]0.
We are using the algebraic topology terminology where cobordism is the
theory dual (in the Spanier-Whitehead sense) to bordism. It is traditional
for geometric topologists to call bordant manifolds “cobordant,” but we will
avoid this terminology in this book.
Thus we know that M1 is the sphere spectrum. We will give a construc-
tion for MG for any structure G.
8.6. Classifying spaces
The construction of Thom spectral is accomplished most easily via the the-
ory of classifying spaces. The basic result about classifying spaces is the
following.
The construction and the proof of this theorem is one of the
student projects for Chapter 4.
Theorem 8.22. Given any topological group G, there exists a principal G-
bundle EG →BG where EG is a contractible space. The construction is

218

functorial, so that any continuous group homomorphism α : G →H induces
a bundle map

compatible with the actions, so that if x ∈EG, g ∈G,
Eα(x · g) = (Eα(x)) · α(g).
The space BG is called a classifying space for G.
The function
Φ : Maps(B, BG) →{Principal G-bundles over B}
deﬁned by pulling back (so Φ(f) = f∗(EG)) induces a bijection from the ho-
motopy set [B, BG] to the set of isomorphism classes of principal G-bundles
over B, when B is a CW-complex (or more generally a paracompact space).
The long exact sequence for the ﬁbration G →EG →BG shows that
πnBG = πn−1G. In fact, ΩBG is (weakly) homotopy equivalent to G, as one
can see by taking the extended ﬁber sequence · · · →ΩEG →ΩBG →G →
EG →BG, computing with homotopy groups, and observing that EG and
ΩEG are contractible. Thus the space BG is a delooping of G.
The following lemma is extremely useful.
Lemma 8.23. Let p : E →B be a principal G-bundle, and let f : B →BG
be the classifying map. Then the homotopy ﬁber of f is weakly homotopy
equivalent to E.
Proof. Turn f : B →BG into a ﬁbration q : B′ →BG using Theorem
6.18 and let F ′ denote the homotopy ﬁber of q : B′ →BG. Thus there is a
commutative diagram

and since EG is contractible, f ◦p = q ◦h ◦p : E →BG is nullhomotopic.
By the homotopy lifting property for the ﬁbration q : B′ →BG it follows
that h ◦p : E →B′ is homotopic into the ﬁber F ′ of q : B′ →BG and so
one obtains a homotopy commutative diagram of spaces

The left edge is a ﬁbration, h is a homotopy equivalence, and by the ﬁve

In Lemma 8.23 one can usually conclude that the homotopy ﬁber of
f : B →BG is in fact a homotopy equivalence. This would follow if we
know that B′ is homotopy equivalent to a CW-complex. This follows for
most G by a theorem of Milnor [24].

8.7. Construction of the Thom spectra
We proceed with the construction of the Thom spectra. We begin with a
few preliminary notions.

220
8. Bordism, Spectra, and Generalized Homology
Deﬁnition 8.24. If E →B is any vector bundle over a CW-complex B
with metric then the Thom space of E →B is the quotient D(E)/S(E),
where D(E) denotes the unit disk bundle of E and S(E) ⊂D(E) denotes
the unit sphere bundle of E.
Notice that the zero section B →E deﬁnes an embedding of B into the
Thom space.
The ﬁrst part of the following exercise is virtually a tautology, but it
is key to understanding why the spectra for bordism are given by Thom
spaces.
Exercise 138.
1. If E →B is a smooth vector bundle over a smooth compact manifold
B, then the Thom space of E is a smooth manifold away from one
point and the 0-section embedding of B into the Thom space is a
smooth embedding with normal bundle isomorphic to the bundle E →
B.
2. The Thom space of a vector bundle over a compact base is homeo-
morphic to the one-point compactiﬁcation of the total space.
Now let a G-structure be given.
Recall that this means we have a
sequence of continuous groups Gn and homomorphisms Gn →O(n) and
Gn →Gn+1 such that the diagram
Gn
→
Gn+1
↓
↓
O(n)
→
O(n + 1)
commutes.
We will construct the Thom spectrum for this structure from the Thom
spaces of vector bundles associated to the principal bundles Gn →EGn →
BGn.
Composing the homomorphism Gn →O(n) with the standard action of
O(n) on Rn deﬁnes an action of Gn on Rn. Use this action to form the
universal Rn-vector bundle over BGn
EGn ×Gn Rn
BGn
❄
Let us denote this vector bundle by Vn →BGn. Notice that by our
assumption that Gn maps to O(n), this vector bundle has a metric, and so
the unit sphere and disk bundles are deﬁned.

Functoriality gives vector bundle maps (which are linear injections on
ﬁbers).

Let MGn denote the Thom space of Vn →BGn. Thus MGn is obtained
by collapsing the unit sphere bundle of Vn in the unit disk bundle to a point.
Lemma 8.25.
1. If E →B is a vector bundle, then the Thom space of E ⊕ε is the
reduced suspension of the Thom space of E.
2. A vector bundle map

which is an isomorphism preserving the metric on each ﬁber induces
a map of Thom spaces.
Proof. To see why the ﬁrst statement is true, note that an O(n)-equivariant
homeomorphism Dn+1 →Dn×I determines an homeomorphism of D(E⊕ε)
with D(E) × I which induces a homeomorphism D(E ⊕ε)/S(E ⊕ε) with
(D(E) × I)/(S(E) × I ∪D(E) × {0, 1}).
But it is easy to see that this identiﬁcation space is the same as the (reduced)
suspension of D(E)/S(E).
The second statement is clear.
The following theorem states that the collection MG = {MGn} forms
a spectrum, and that the corresponding homology theory is the bordism
theory deﬁned by the corresponding structure.
Theorem 8.26. The ﬁberwise injection Vn →Vn+1 extends to a (metric
preserving) bundle map Vn ⊕ε →Vn+1 which is an isomorphism on each
ﬁber, and hence deﬁnes a map
kn : SMGn →MGn+1.
Thus {MGn, kn} = MG is a spectrum, called the Thom spectrum.

222
8. Bordism, Spectra, and Generalized Homology
Moreover, the bordism groups ΩG
n (X) are isomorphic to Hn(X; MG).
Proof. Since the diagram
Gn

Gn+1

O(n + 1)
commutes, where O(n) →O(n + 1) is the homomorphism

it follows by the construction of Vn that the pullback of Vn+1 by the map
γn : BGn →BGn+1 splits canonically into a direct sum γ∗
n(Vn+1) = Vn ⊕ε.
Thus the diagram
Vn

which is an isomorphism on each ﬁber; this isomorphism preserves the met-
rics since the actions are orthogonal.
By Lemma 8.25, the above bundle map deﬁnes a map
kn : SMGn →MGn+1
establishing the ﬁrst part of the theorem.
We now outline how to establish the isomorphism
ΩG
n (X) = lim
ℓ→∞πn+ℓ(X+ ∧MGℓ).
This is a slightly more complicated version of the Pontrjagin-Thom con-
struction we described before, using the basic property of classifying spaces.
We will ﬁrst deﬁne the collapse map
c : ΩG
n (X) →lim
ℓ→∞πn+ℓ(X+ ∧MGℓ).
Suppose [W, f, γ] ∈ΩG
n (X). So W is an n-manifold with a G-structure
on its stable normal bundle, and f : W →X is a continuous map. Embed W
in Sn+ℓfor some large ℓso that the normal bundle ν(W) has a Gℓ-structure.

8.7. Construction of the Thom spectra
223
Let F →W be the principal O(ℓ)-bundle of orthonormal frames in
ν(W). The statement that ν(W) has a Gℓ-structure is equivalent to saying
that there is a principal Gℓ-bundle P →W and a bundle map

which is equivariant with respect to the homomorphism
Gℓ→O(ℓ).
Let c1 : W →BGℓclassify the principal bundle P →W.
Then by
deﬁnition ν(W) is isomorphic to the pullback c∗
1(Vℓ).
Let U be a tubular neighborhood of W in Sn+ℓand D ⊂U ⊂Sn+ℓ
correspond to the disk bundle. Deﬁne a map
h : Sn+ℓ→MGℓ
by taking everything outside of D to the base point, and on D, take the
composite
D ∼= D(ν(W)) →D(Vℓ) →MGℓ.
The product
f × h : Sn+ℓ→X × MGℓ
composes with the collapse
X × MGℓ→X+ ∧MGℓ
to give a map
α = f ∧h : Sn+ℓ→X+ ∧MGℓ.
We have thus deﬁned the collapse map
c : ΩG
n (X) →lim
ℓ→∞πn+ℓ(X+ ∧MGℓ) = Hn(X; MG).
To motivate the deﬁnition of the inverse of c, we will make a few com-
ments on the above construction.
The ﬁgure below illustrates that the
composite of the zero section z : BGℓ→D(Vℓ) and the quotient map
D(Vℓ) →MGℓis a embedding.

We thus will consider BGℓto be a subset of MGℓ. Then in the above

Next we use transversality to deﬁne the inverse of this the collapse map
c. Represent ˆα ∈Hn(X; MG) by
α : Sn+ℓ→X+ ∧MGℓ.
Observe that the composite
X × BGℓ→X+ × MGℓ→X+ ∧MGℓ
is an embedding, since:
1. BGℓmisses the base point of MGℓ, and
2. the base point of X+ misses X.
(The following ﬁgure gives an analogue by illustrating the embedding of

Furthermore
X × BGℓ⊂X+ ∧MGℓ

π2 : X × BGℓ→BGℓis the projection on the second factor. Transversality,
adapted to this setting, says that α : Sn+ℓ→X+ ∧MGℓcan be homotoped
slightly to a map β so that W = β−1(X × BGℓ) is a smooth manifold,
and whose tubular neighborhood, i.e. the normal bundle of W, has a G-
structure. The composite of β : W →X × BGℓand pr1 : X × BGℓ→X
give the desired element (W →X) ∈ΩG
n (X).
We sort of rushed through the construction of the inverse map to c, so
we will backtrack and discuss some details. For every point in BGℓ, there

is a neighborhood U ⊂BGℓover which the bundle Vℓ→BGℓis trivial and
so there is a map
α−1(X × U) →Dℓ/Sℓ
deﬁned by composing α with projection on the ﬁber. Transversality then
applies to this map between manifolds and one can patch together to get
β using partitions of unity. Furthermore, transversality gives a diagram of

so that the normal bundle of W inherits a G-structure.
Next note that replacing ℓby ℓ+ 1 leads to the same bordism element.
Stabilizing the normal bundle
ν(W →Sn+ℓ) −→ν(W →Sn+ℓ) ⊕ε = ν(W →Sn+ℓ+1)
corresponds to including W ⊂Sn+ℓ⊂Sn+ℓ+1. Since the composite
SSn+ℓ

kℓ∧Id
−−−→X+ ∧MGℓ+1
replaces the tubular neighborhood of X × BGℓ, i.e. X × Vℓby X × (Vℓ⊕ε),
the construction gives a well-deﬁned stable G-structure on the stable normal
bundle of W.
The full proof that the indicated map Hn(X; MG) →ΩG
n (X) is well-
deﬁned and is the inverse of c is a careful but routine check of details in-
volving bordisms, homotopies, and stabilization.
Taking X to be a point, we see that the groups (called the coeﬃcients)
ΩG
n = ΩG
n (pt) are isomorphic to the homotopy groups lim
ℓ→∞πn+ℓ(MGℓ), since
pt+ ∧M = M.
As an example of how these coeﬃcients can be understood geometrically,
consider oriented bordism, corresponding to Gn = SO(n). The coeﬃcients
ΩSO
n
equal πn+ℓ(MSOℓ) for ℓlarge enough. Some basic computations are
the following.
1. An oriented closed 0-manifold is just a signed ﬁnite number of points.
This bounds a 1-manifold if and only if the sum of the signs is zero.
Hence ΩSO
0
∼= Z. Also, πℓMSOℓ= Z for ℓ≥2.
2. Every oriented closed 1-manifold bounds an oriented 2-manifold, since
S1 = ∂D2. Therefore ΩSO
1
= 0.

226
8. Bordism, Spectra, and Generalized Homology
3. Every oriented 2-manifold bounds an oriented 3-manifold since any
oriented 2-manifold embeds in R3 with one of the two complementary
components compact. Thus ΩSO
2
= 0.
4. A theorem of Rohlin states that every oriented 3-manifold bounds a
4-manifold. Thus ΩSO
3
= 0.
5. An oriented 4-manifold has a signature in Z, i.e. the signature of
its intersection form.
A good exercise using Poincar´e duality (see
the projects for Chapter 3) shows that this is an oriented bordism
invariant, and hence deﬁnes a homomorphism ΩSO
4
→Z. This turns
out to be an isomorphism. More generally the signature deﬁnes a
map ΩSO
4k →Z for all k. This is a surjection since the signature of
CP 2k is 1.
6. It is a fact that away from multiples of 4, the oriented bordism groups
are torsion, i.e. ΩSO
n
⊗Q = 0 if n ̸= 4k.
7. For all n, ΩSO
n
is ﬁnitely generated, in fact, a ﬁnite direct sum of Z’s
and Z/2’s.
Statements 5, 6, and 7 can be proven by computing πn+ℓ(MSOℓ). How
does one do this? A starting point is the Thom isomorphism theorem, which
says that for all k,
Hn(BSO(ℓ)) ∼= ˜Hn+ℓ(MSOℓ)
(where ˜H denotes reduced cohomology). The cohomology of BSO(n) can
be studied in several ways, an so one can obtain information about the
cohomology of MSOℓby this theorem. Combining this with the Hurewicz
theorem and other methods leads ultimately to a complete computation of
oriented bordism (due to C.T.C. Wall), and this technique was generalized
by Adams to a machine called the Adams spectral sequence. We will return
to the Thom isomorphism theorem in Chapter 10.
Once the coeﬃcients are understood, one can use the fact that bordism
is a homology theory to compute ΩSO
n (X). For now we just remark that
there is a map ΩSO
n (X) →Hn(X) deﬁned by taking f : M →X to the
image of the fundamental class f∗[M]. Thus for example, the identity map
on a closed, oriented manifold Mn is non-zero in ΩSO
n (M).
We can also make an elementary remark about unoriented bordism,
which corresponds to Gn = O(n). Notice ﬁrst that for any α ∈ΩO
n (X),
2α = 0. Indeed, if f : V n →X represents α, take F : V × I →X to be
F(x, t) = f(x) then ∂(V × I, F) = 2(V, f). Thus ΩO
n (X) consists only of
elements of order 2. The full computation of unoriented bordism is due to
Thom. We will discuss this more in Section 10.10.

Exercise 139. Show that ΩO

2 = Z/2. (Hint: for
ΩO
2 use the classiﬁcation theorem for closed surfaces, then show that if a
surface F is a boundary of a 3-manifold, then dim H1(F; Z/2) is even.)
There are several conventions regarding notation for bordism groups;
each has its advantages. Given a structure deﬁned by a sequence G = {Gn},
one can use the notation
ΩG
∗(X),
H∗(X; MG) or MG∗(X).
There is a generalization of a G-structure called a B-structure. It is
given by a sequence of commutative diagrams

where the vertical maps are ﬁbrations. A G-structure in the old sense gives
a BG = {BGn}-structure. A B-structure has a Thom spectrum TB =
{T(ξn)}, where ξn here denotes the vector bundle pulled back from the
canonical bundle over BOn. There is a notion of a stable B-structure on a
normal bundle of an embedded M, which implies that there is a map from the
(stablized) normal bundle to ξk. There is a Pontrjagin-Thom isomorphism
ΩB
n (X) ∼= Hn(X; TB).
For a precise discussion of B-bordism and for further information on
bordism in general, see [30], [39] and the references therein.
8.8. Generalized homology theories
We have several functors from (based) spaces to graded abelian groups:
stable homotopy πS
n(X), bordism ΩG
n (X), or, more generally, homology of
a space with coeﬃcients in a spectrum Hn(X; K). These are examples of
generalized homology theories. Generalized homology theories come in two
(equivalent) ﬂavors, reduced and unreduced. Unreduced theories apply to
unbased spaces and pairs. Reduced theories are functors on based spaces.
The equivalence between the two points of view is obtained by passing from
(X, A) to X/A and from X to X+.
There are three high points to look out for in our discussion of homology
theories.
• The axioms of a (co)homology theory are designed for computations.
One ﬁrst computes the coeﬃcients of the theory (perhaps using the

228
8. Bordism, Spectra, and Generalized Homology
Adams spectral sequence), and then computes the homology of a CW-
complex X, using excision, Mayer–Vietoris, or a generalization of cel-
lular homology discussed in the next chapter, the Atiyah–Hirzebruch
spectral sequence.
• There is a uniqueness theorem.
A natural transformation of (co)-
homology theories inducing an isomorphism on coeﬃcients induces
an isomorphism for all CW-complexes X.
• A (co)homology theory is given by (co)homology with coeﬃcients in
a spectrum K.
8.8.1. Reduced homology theories. Let K∗be the category of com-
pactly generated spaces with non-degenerate base points.
Deﬁnition 8.27. A reduced homology theory is
1. A family of covariant functors
hn : K∗→A for n ∈Z
where A denotes the category of abelian groups. (Remark: we do not
assume hn is zero for n < 0.)
2. A family of natural transformations
en : hn →hn+1 ◦S
where S : K∗→K∗is the (reduced) suspension functor.
These must satisfy the three following axioms:
A1. (Homotopy) If f0, f1 : X →Y are homotopic, then
hn(f0) = hn(f1) : hn(X) →hn(Y )
A2. (Exactness) For f : X →Y , let Cf be the mapping cone of f,
and j : Y →Cf the inclusion. Then
hn(X)
hn(f)
−−−→hn(Y )
hn(j)
−−−→hn(Cf)
is exact for all n ∈Z.
A3. (Suspension) The homomorphism
en(X) : hn(X) →hn+1(SX)
given by the natural transformation en is an isomorphism for
all n ∈Z.
Exercise 140. Show that ordinary singular homology deﬁnes a homology
theory in this sense by taking hn(X) to be the reduced homology of X.
There are two other “nondegeneracy” axioms which a given generalized
homology theory or may not satisfy.

8.8. Generalized homology theories
229
A4. (Additivity) If X is a wedge product X =
)
j∈JXj, then

j∈J
hn(Xj) →hn(X)
is an isomorphism for all n ∈Z.
A5. (Isotropy) If f : X →Y is a weak homotopy equivalence, then hn(f)
is an isomorphism for all n ∈Z.
If we work in the category of based CW-complexes instead of K∗, then
A5 follows from A1 by the Whitehead theorem. Given a reduced homology
theory on based CW-complexes, it extends uniquely to an isotropic theory
on K∗.
For any reduced homology theory, hn(pt) = 0 for all n, since
hn(pt) →hn(pt) →hn(pt/pt) = hn(pt)
is exact, but also each arrow is an isomorphism. Thus the reduced homology
of a point says nothing about the theory; instead one makes the following
deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 8.28. The coeﬃcients of a reduced homology theory are the
groups {hn(S0)}.
A homology theory is called ordinary (or proper) if it satisﬁes
hn(S0) = 0 for n ̸= 0.
(This is the dimension axiom of Eilenberg–Steenrod.) Singular homology
with coeﬃcients in an abelian group A is an example of a ordinary theory.
It follows from a simple argument using the Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral se-
quence that any ordinary reduced homology theory is isomorphic to reduced
singular homology with coeﬃcients in A = h0(S0).
If (X, A) is an NDR pair, then we saw in Chapter 6 that the mapping
cone Cf is homotopy equivalent to X/A. Thus hn(A) →hn(X) →hn(X/A)
is exact. Also in Chapter 6 we proved that the sequence
A →X →X/A →SA →SX →S(X/A) →· · ·
has each three term sequence a (homotopy) coﬁbration. Thus
hn(A) →hn(X) →hn(X/A) →hn(SA) →hn(SX) →· · ·
is exact. Applying the transformations en and using Axiom A3 we conclude
that
→hn(A) →hn(X) →hn(X/A) →hn−1(A) →hn−1(X) →· · ·
is exact. Thus to any reduced homology theory one obtains a long exact
sequence associated to a coﬁbration.

230
8. Bordism, Spectra, and Generalized Homology
Exercise 141. Let X be a based CW-complex with subcomplexes A and B,
both of which contain the base point. Show that for any reduced homology
theory h∗there is a Mayer–Vietoris long exact sequence
· · · →hn(A ∩B) →hn(A) ⊕hn(B) →hn(X) →hn−1(A ∩B) →· · ·
8.8.2. Unreduced homology theories. We will derive unreduced theo-
ries from reduced theories, to emphasize that these are the same concept,
presented slightly diﬀerently.
Let K2 denote the category of NDR pairs (X, A), allowing the case when
A is empty. Given a reduced homology theory {hn, en} deﬁne functors Hn
on K2 as follows (for this discussion, Hn does not denote ordinary singular
homology!).
1. Let
Hn(X, A) = hn(X+/A+) =

hn(X/A)
if A ̸= φ,
hn(X+)
if A = φ
2. Let ∂n : Hn(X, A) →Hn−1(A) be the composite:
Hn(X, A) = hn(X+/A+)
∼
=
−→hn(Ci) −→hn(SA+)
∼
=
−→hn−1(A+) = Hn−1(A)
where Ci is the mapping cone of the inclusion i : A+ →X+, and
Ci →SA+ is the quotient
Ci →Ci/X+ = SA+.
Then {Hn, ∂n} satisfy the Eilenberg–Steenrod axioms:
A1. (Homotopy) If f0, f1 : (X, A) →(Y, B) are (freely) homotopic then
Hn(f0) = Hn(f1) : Hn(X, A) →Hn(Y, B)
A2. (Exactness) For a coﬁbration i : A →X, let j : (X, φ) →(X, A),
then
· · · →Hn+1(X, A)
∂n+1
−−−→Hn(A)
Hn(i)
−−−→Hn(X)
Hn(j)
−−−→Hn(X, A) →· · ·
is exact.
A3. (Excision) Suppose that X = A ∪B, with A, B closed, and suppose
that (A, A ∩B) is an NDR pair. Then
Hn(A, A ∩B) →Hn(X, B)
is an isomorphism for all n ∈Z.
Exercise 142. Prove that these three properties hold using the axioms of
a reduced theory.
If a reduced theory is additive and/or isotropic, the functors Hn likewise
satisfy

8.8. Generalized homology theories
231
A4. (Additivity) Let X = ⨿j∈JXj, A ⊂X, Aj = Xj ∩A. Then

j∈J
Hn(Xj, Aj) →Hn(X, A)
is an isomorphism for all n ∈Z.
A5. (Isotropy) If f : X →Y is a weak homotopy equivalence, then
Hn(f) : Hn(X) →Hn(Y ) is an isomorphism for all n ∈Z.
Notice that if the reduced theory is ordinary, then Hn(pt) = 0 for n ̸= 0.
One uses these properties to deﬁne an unreduced homology theory.
Deﬁnition 8.29. A collection of functors {Hn, ∂n} on K2 is called a (unre-
duced) homology theory if it satisﬁes the three axioms A1, A2, and A3. It is
called additive and/or isotropic if A4 and/or A5 hold. It is called ordinary
or proper if Hn(pt) = 0 for n ̸= 0.
The coeﬃcients of the unreduced homology theory are the groups {Hn(pt)}.
One can go back and forth: an unreduced homology theory {Hn, ∂n}
deﬁnes a reduced one by taking hn(X) = Hn(X, {∗}). The following theorem
is proved in [43, Section XII.6].
Theorem 8.30. These constructions set up a 1 −1 correspondence (up to
natural isomorphism) between reduced homology theories on K∗and (unre-
duced) homology theories on K2. Moreover the reduced theory is additive,
isotropic, or ordinary if and only if the corresponding unreduced theory is.
The uniqueness theorem below has an easy inductive cell-by-cell proof
in the case of ﬁnite CW-complexes, but requires a more delicate limiting
argument for inﬁnite CW-complexes.
Theorem 8.31 (Eilenberg–Steenrod uniqueness theorem).
1. Let T : (Hn, ∂n) →(H′
n, ∂′
n) be a natural transformation of homol-
ogy theories deﬁned on the category of ﬁnite CW-pairs such that
T : H∗(pt) →H′
∗(pt) is an isomorphism. Then T : H∗(X, A) →
H′
∗(X, A) is an isomorphism for all ﬁnite CW-pairs.
2. Let T : (Hn, ∂n) →(H′
n, ∂′
n) be a natural transformation of addi-
tive homology theories deﬁned on the category of CW-pairs where
T : H∗(pt) →H′
∗(pt) is an isomorphism. Then T : H∗(X, A) →
H′
∗(X, A) is an isomorphism for all CW-pairs.

8.8.3. Homology theories and spectra.
Theorem 8.32. (Reduced) homology with coeﬃcients in a spectrum K
Hn(−; K) : X →lim
ℓ→∞πn+ℓ(X ∧Kℓ)
Hn(−; K) : (X, A) →lim
ℓ→∞πn+ℓ((X+/A+) ∧Kℓ)
is a (reduced) homology theory satisfying the additivity axiom.
One needs to prove the axioms A1, A2, A3, and A5. The homotopy
axiom is of course obvious.
The axiom A2 follows from the facts about
the Puppe sequences we proved in Chapter 6 by passing to the limit. The
suspension axiom holds almost eﬀortlessly from the fact that the theory is
deﬁned by taking the direct limit over suspension maps.
The additivity
axiom follows from the fact that the image of a sphere is compact and that
a compact subspace of an inﬁnite wedge is contained in a ﬁnite wedge.
A famous theorem of E. Brown (the Brown representation theorem) gives
a converse of the above theorem. It leads to a shift in perspective on the
functors of algebraic topology by prominently placing spectra as the source
of homology theories. Here is a precise statement.
Theorem 8.33.
1. Let {Hn, ∂n} be an homology theory. There there exists a spectrum
K and a natural isomorphism Hn(X, A) ∼= Hn(X, A; K) for all ﬁnite
CW-pairs.
2. Let {Hn, ∂n} be an additive homology theory. There there exists a
spectrum K and a natural isomorphism Hn(X, A) ∼= Hn(X, A; K) for
all CW-pairs.
We have seen several examples: an ordinary homology theory corre-
sponds to the Eilenberg–Maclane spectrum K(A), stable homotopy corre-
sponds to the sphere spectrum S, and the bordism theories correspond to
Thom spectra. Note that the Brown representation theorem shows that for
any homology theory, there is a spectrum, and hence an associated general-
ized cohomology theory.
Exercise 143. Give a deﬁnition of a map of spectra. Deﬁne maps of spectra
S →K(Z) and S →MG inducing the Hurewicz map πS
n(X) →Hn(X) and
the map Ωfr
n(X) →ΩG
n (X) from framed to G-bordism.
8.8.4. Generalized cohomology theories. The development of coho-
mology theories parallels that of homology theories following the principle
of reversing arrows.
Exercise 144. Deﬁne reduced and unreduced cohomology theories.

8.8. Generalized homology theories
233
There is one surprise however. In order for Hn(
; K) to be an additive
theory (which means the cohomology of a disjoint union is a direct product),
one must require that K is an Ω-spectrum, a spectrum so that the adjoints
Kn →ΩKn+1
of the structure maps kn are homotopy equivalences. Conversely, the Brown
representation theorem applied to an additive cohomology theory produces
an Ω-spectrum. The Eilenberg–MacLane spectrum is an Ω-spectrum while
the sphere spectrum or more generally bordism spectra are not.
An important example of a generalized cohomology theory is topological
K-theory. It is the subject of one of the projects at the end of this chapter.
Complex topological K-theory has a deﬁnition in terms of stable equivalence
classes of complex vector bundles, but we instead indicate the deﬁnition in
terms of a spectrum. Most proofs of the Bott periodicity theorem (Theorem
6.51, which states that πnU ∼= Z for n odd and πnU = 0 for n even), actually
prove a stronger result, that there is a homotopy equivalence
Z × BU ≃Ω2(Z × BU).
This allows the deﬁnition of the complex K-theory spectrum with
Kn =

Z × BU
if n is even,
Ω(Z × BU)
if n is odd.
(8.1)
The structure maps kn
S(Z × BU) →Ω(Z × BU)
SΩ(Z × BU) →Z × BU
are given by the adjoints of the Bott periodicity homotopy equivalence and
the identity map
Z × BU →Ω2(Z × BU)
Ω(Z × BU) →Ω(Z × BU).
Thus the complex K-theory spectrum is an Ω-spectrum. The corresponding
cohomology theory is called complex K-theory and satisﬁes
Kn(X) = Kn+2(X)
for all n ∈Z.
In particular this is a non-connective cohomology theory, where a con-
nective cohomology theory is one that satisﬁes Hn(X) = 0 for all n < n0.
Ordinary homology, as well as bordism theories, are connective, since a
manifold of negative dimension is empty.
A good reference for the basic results in the study of spectra (stable
homotopy theory) is Adams’ book [2].

this material are the books by Atiyah [3] and Husemoller [17].
8.9.3. Spanier-Whitehead duality. Spanier-Whitehead duality is a gen-
eralization of Alexander duality which gives a geometric method of going
back and forth between a generalized homology theory and a generalized
cohomology theory. Suppose that X ⊂Sn+1 is a ﬁnite simplicial complex,
and let Y = Sn+1 −X, or better, Y = Sn+1 −U where U is some open
simplicial neighborhood of X which deformation retracts to X. Recall that
Alexander duality implies that
Hp(X) ∼= Hn−p(Y ).
(See Theorem 3.26.) What this means is that the cohomology of X deter-
mines the homology of Y and vice versa.
The strategy is to make this work for generalized cohomology theories
and any space X, and to remove the dependence on the embedding. The
best way to do this is to do it carefully using spectra. Look at Spanier’s
article [35]. There is a good sequence of exercises developing this material
in [36, pages 462-463]. Another reference using the language of spectra is
[39, page 321].
Here is a slightly low-tech outline. You should lecture on the following,
providing details.
Given based spaces X and Y , let
{X, Y } = lim
k→∞[Sk ∧X, Sk ∧Y ]0.

Given a ﬁnite simplicial subcomplex X ⊂Sn+1, let DnX ⊂Sn+1 be a ﬁnite
simplicial subcomplex which is a deformation retract of Sn+1 −X. Then
SDnX is homotopy equivalent to Sn+2 −X.
For k large enough, the homotopy type of the suspension SkDnX de-
pends only on X and k + n, and not on the choice of embedding into Sn+1.
Moreover, for any spaces Y and Z
{SqY, DnX ∧Z} = {Sq−nY ∧X, Z}
(8.2)
As an example, taking Y = S0 and Z = K(Z, p + q −n), Equation (8.2)
says that
{Sq, DnX ∧K(Z, p + q −n)} = {Sq−n ∧X, K(Z, p + q −n)}.
(8.3)
Deﬁnition 8.20 says that the left side of Equation (8.3) is Hn−p(DnX; K(Z)).
The right side is Hp(X; Z), using the fact that [SA, K(Z, k)] = [A, ΩK(Z, k)] =
[A, K(Z, k −1)].
What this means is that by combining Alexander duality, the result
Hq(X) = [X, K(Z, q)] of obstruction theory, and Spanier-Whitehead du-
ality (i.e. Equation (8.2)), the deﬁnition of homology with coeﬃcients in
the Eilenberg–Maclane spectrum given in Deﬁnition 8.20 coincides with the
usual deﬁnition of (ordinary) homology (at least for ﬁnite simplicial com-
plexes, but this works more generally).
This justiﬁes Deﬁnition 8.20 of homology with coeﬃcients in an arbitrary
spectrum K. It also gives a duality Hn−p(DnX; K) = Hp(X; K), which
could be either considered as a generalization of Alexander duality or as a
further justiﬁcation of the deﬁnition of (co)homology with coeﬃcients in a
spectrum.


Chapter 9
Spectral Sequences
Spectral sequences are powerful computational tools in topology. They also
can give quick proofs of important theoretical results such as the Hurewicz
theorem and the Freudenthal suspension theorem. Computing with spectral
sequences is somewhat like computing integrals in calculus; it is helpful to
have ingenuity and a supply of tricks, and even so, you may not arrive at the
ﬁnal solution to your problem. There are many spectral sequences which
give diﬀerent kinds of information. We will focus on one important spectral
sequence, the Leray-Serre-Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence which takes
as input a ﬁbration over a CW-complex and a generalized homology or
cohomology theory. This spectral sequence exhibits a complicated relation-
ship between the generalized (co)homology of the total space and ﬁber and
the ordinary (co)homology of the base. Many other spectral sequences can
be derived from this one by judicious choice of ﬁbration and generalized
(co)homology theory.
Carefully setting up and proving the basic result requires very careful
bookkeeping; the emphasis in these notes will be on applications and how
to calculate. The project for this chapter is to outline the proof of the main
theorem, Theorem 9.6.
9.1. Deﬁnition of a spectral sequence
Deﬁnition 9.1. A spectral sequence is a homological object of the following
type:
One is given a sequence of chain complexes
(Er, dr)
237

238
9. Spectral Sequences
for r = 1, 2, . . .
and isomorphisms:
Er+1 ∼= H(Er, dr) = ker dr : Er →Er
Im dr : Er →Er .
The isomorphisms are ﬁxed as part of the structure of the spectral se-
quence so henceforth we will fudge the distinction between “∼=” and “=” in
the above context.
In this deﬁnition the term “chain complex” just means an abelian group
(or R-module) with an endomorphism whose square is zero. In many impor-
tant contexts, the spectral sequence has more structure, namely the chain
complexes Er are graded or even bigraded, that is, Er decomposes as a direct
sum of terms Er
p,q for (p, q) ∈Z ⊕Z. Moreover the diﬀerentials dr have a
well-deﬁned bidegree. For example, in a homology spectral sequence, usually
dr has bidegree (−r, r −1). In other words dr(Er
p,q) ⊂Er
p−r,q+r−1.
A student ﬁrst exposed to this plethora of notation may be intimidated;
the important fact to keep in mind is that a bigrading decomposes a big
object (Er) into bite-sized pieces (Er
p,q).
Information about the Er
p,q for
some pairs (p, q) gives information about Er+1
p,q
for (probably fewer) pairs
(p, q). But with luck one can derive valuable information. For example,
from what has been said so far you should easily be able to see that if
Er
p,q = 0 for some ﬁxed pair (p, q), then Er+k
p,q
= 0 for all k ≥0. This simple
observation can sometimes be used to derive highly non-trivial information.
When computing with spectral sequences it is very useful to draw diagrams
like the following.

In this picture the short arrow depicts the diﬀerential d2 : E2
3,0 →E2
1,1 and
the long arrow corresponds to the diﬀerential d3 : E3
3,0 →E3
0,2.
One usually computes with a spectral sequence in the following way. A
theorem will state that there exists a spectral sequence so that:
1. the modules E2 (or E1) can be identiﬁed with something known, and
2. the limit
E∞= lim
r→∞Er
is related to something one wishes to compute.
It can also work the opposite way, E∞can be related to something known
and E2 can be related to something we wish to compute. In either case,
this gives a complicated relationship between two things. The relationship
usually involves exact sequences.
In favorable circumstances information
can be derived by carefully analyzing this relationship.
As an example to see how this may be used, the Leray–Serre spectral
sequence of a ﬁbration implies that if F →E →B is a ﬁbration with B
simply connected, then there is a spectral sequence with
E2
p,q ∼= Hp(B; Q) ⊗Hq(F; Q)
and with
Hn(E; Q) ∼= ⊕pE∞
p,n−p.
This establishes a relationship between the homology of the base, total space,
and ﬁber of a ﬁbration. Of course, the hard work when computing with this
spectral sequence is in getting from E2 to E∞. But partial computations and
results are often accessible. For example, we will show later (and the reader
may wish to show as an exercise now) that if ⊕pHp(B; Q) and ⊕qHq(F; Q)
are ﬁnite-dimensional, then so is ⊕nHn(E; Q) and
χ(B) · χ(F) = χ(E).
Another example: if Hp(B; Q)⊗Hn−p(F; Q) = 0 for all p, then Hn(E; Q) =
0. This generalizes a similar fact which can be proven for the trivial ﬁbration
B × F →B using the K¨unneth theorem.
The next few deﬁnitions will provide us with a language to describe the
way that the parts of the spectral sequence ﬁt together.
Deﬁnition 9.2. A ﬁltration of an R-module A is an increasing union
0 ⊂· · · ⊂F−1 ⊂F0 ⊂F1 ⊂· · · ⊂Fp ⊂· · · ⊂A.
of submodules. A ﬁltration is convergent if the union of the Fp’s is A and
their intersection is 0.

240
9. Spectral Sequences
If A itself is graded, then the ﬁltration is assumed to preserve the grading
i.e. Fp ∩An ⊂Fp+1 ∩An. If A is graded, then we bigrade the ﬁltration by
setting
Fp,q = Fp ∩Ap+q.
We will mostly deal with ﬁltrations that are bounded below, i.e. Fs = 0
for some s, or bounded above, i.e. Ft = A for some t, or bounded, i.e. bounded
above and bounded below. In this book, we will always have F−1 = 0.
Deﬁnition 9.3. Given a ﬁltration F = {Fn} of an R-module A the associ-
ated graded module is the graded R-module denoted by Gr(A, F) and deﬁned
by
Gr(A, F)p =
Fp
Fp−1
.
We will usually just write Gr(A) when the ﬁltration is clear from context.
In general, one is interested in the algebraic structure of A rather than
Gr(A). Notice that Gr(A) contains some (but not necessarily all) informa-
tion about A. For example, for a convergent ﬁltration:
1. If Gr(A) = 0, then A = 0.
2. If R is a ﬁeld and A is a ﬁnite dimensional vector space, then each
Fi is a subspace and Gr(A) and A have the same dimension. Thus
in this case Gr(A) determines A up to isomorphism. This holds for
more general R if each Gr(A)n is free and the ﬁltration is bounded
above.
3. If R = Z, then given a prime b, information about the b-primary
part of Gr(A) gives information about the b-primary part of A; e.g.
if Gr(A)p has no b-torsion for all p then A has no b-torsion for all
p. However, the b-primary part of Gr(A) does not determine the b-
primary part of A; e.g. if Gr(A)0 = Z, Gr(A)1 = Z/2, and Gr(A)n =
0 for n ̸= 0, 1, it is impossible to determine whether A ∼= Z or A ∼=
Z ⊕Z/2.
In short, knowing the quotients Gr(A)p = Fp
*
Fp−1 determines A up to
“extension questions,” at least when the ﬁltration is bounded.
Deﬁnition 9.4. A bigraded spectral sequence (Er
p,q, dr) is called a homology
spectral sequence if the diﬀerential dr has bidgree (−r, r −1).
Deﬁnition 9.5. Given a bigraded homology spectral sequence (Er
p,q, dr),
and a graded R-module A∗, we say the spectral sequence converges to A∗
and write
E2
p,q ⇒Ap+q
if:

9.2. The Leray-Serre-Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence
241
1. for each p, q, there exists an r0 so that dr
p,q is zero for each r ≥r0 (by
Exercise 145 below this implies Er
p,q surjects to Er+1
p,q
for r ≥r0) and,
2. there is a convergent ﬁltration of A∗, so that for each n, the limit
E∞
p,n−p = lim
r→∞Er
p,n−p is isomorphic to the associated graded module
Gr(A∗)p.
In many favorable situations (e.g. ﬁrst-quadrant spectral sequences where
E2
p,q = 0 if p < 0 or q < 0) the convergence is stronger, namely for each pair
(p, q) there exists an r0 so that Er
p,q = E∞
p,q for all r ≥r0.
An even stronger notion of convergence is the following. Suppose that
there exists an r0 so that for each (p, q) and all r ≥r0, Er
p,q = E∞
p,q. When
this happens we say the spectral sequence collapses at Er0.
Exercise 145. Fix p, q ∈Z ⊕Z.
1. Show that if there exists r0(p, q) so that dr
p,q = 0 for all r ≥r0(p, q),
then there exists a surjection Er
p,q →Er+1
p,q
for all r ≥r0(p, q).
2. Show that if E2
p,q = 0 whenever p < 0 then there exists a number
r0 = r0(p, q) as above.
Theorems on spectral sequences usually take the form: “There exists a
spectral sequence with E2
p,q some known object converging to A∗.” This is
an abbreviated way to say that the E∞-terms are on the one hand the limits
of the Er-terms, and on the other the graded pieces in the associated graded
Gr(A∗) to A∗.
9.2. The Leray-Serre-Atiyah-Hirzebruch
spectral sequence
Serre, based on earlier work of Leray, constructed a spectral sequence con-
verging to H∗(E), given a ﬁbration
F →E
f−→B.
Atiyah and Hirzebruch, based on earlier work of G. Whitehead, constructed
a spectral sequence converging to G∗(B) where G∗is an additive generalized
homology theory and B is a CW-complex . The spectral sequence we present
here is a combination of these spectral sequences and converges to G∗(E)
when G∗is an additive homology theory. The spectral sequence is carefully
constructed in [43], and we refer you there for a proof.
We may assume B is path connected by restricting to path components,
but we do not wish to assume B is simply connected.
In order to deal
with this case we will have to use local coeﬃcients derived from the ﬁbra-
tion. Theorem 6.12 shows that the homotopy lifting property gives rise to

242
9. Spectral Sequences
a homomorphism
π1B →{Homotopy classes of homotopy equivalences F →F}.
Applying the (homotopy) functor Gn one obtains a representation
π1B →Aut (GnF)
for each integer n. Thus for each n, Gn(F) has the structure of a Z[π1B]
module or, equivalently, one has a system of local coeﬃcients over B with
ﬁber Gn(F). (Of course, if π1B = 1 than this is a trivial local coeﬃcient
system.)
Taking (ordinary) homology with local coeﬃcients, we can associate the
group Hp(B; GqF) to each pair of integers p, q. Notice that Hp(B; GqF) is
zero if p < 0.
Theorem 9.6. Let F →E
f−→B be a ﬁbration, with B a path connected
CW-complex. Let G∗be an additive homology theory. Then there exists a
spectral sequence
Hp(B; GqF) ∼= E2
p,q ⇒Gp+q(E).
Exercise 146. If G∗is an additive, isotropic homology theory, then the
hypothesis that B is a CW-complex can be omitted. (Hint: for any space
B there is a weak homotopy equivalence from a CW-complex to B.)
As a service to the reader, we will explicitly unravel the statement of
the above theorem. There exists
1. A (bounded below) ﬁltration
0 = F−1,n+1 ⊂F0,n ⊂F1,n−1 ⊂· · · ⊂Fp,n−p ⊂· · · ⊂Gn(E)
of Gn(E) = ∪pFp,n−p for each integer n.
2. A bigraded spectral sequence (Er
∗,∗, dr) such that the diﬀerential dr
has bidegree (−r, r −1) (i.e. dr(Er
p,q) ⊂Er
p−r,q+r−1), and so
Er+1
p,q =
ker dr : Er
p,q →Er
p−r,q+r−1
Im dr : Er
p+r,q−r+1 →Erp,q
.
3. Isomorphisms E2
p,q ∼= Hp(B; GqF).
This spectral sequence converges to G∗(E). That is, for each ﬁxed p, q,
there exists an r0 so that
dr : Er
p,q →Er
p−r,q+r−1
is zero for all r ≥r0 and so
Er+1
p,q = Er
p,q
*
dr(Er
p+r,q−r+1)

9.2. The Leray-Serre-Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence

for all r ≥r0.
Deﬁne E∞
p,q = lim
r→∞Er
p,q. There is an isomorphism
Fp,q
*
Fp−1,q+1 ∼= E∞
p,q,
i.e.
Gr(GnE)p ∼= E∞
p,n−p
with respect to the ﬁltration of Gn(E).
In this spectral sequence, some ﬁltrations of the groups Gn(E) are given,
with the associated graded groups made up of the pieces E∞
p,n−p. So, for
example, if Gn(E) = 0, then E∞
p,n−p = 0 for each p ∈Z.
The ﬁltration is given by
Fp,n−p = Im (Gn(f−1(Bp)) →GnE)
where f : E →B is the ﬁbration and Bp denotes the p-skeleton of B.
As a ﬁrst non-trivial example of computing with spectral sequences we
consider the problem of computing the homology of the loop space of a
sphere. Given k > 1, let P = Px0Sk be the space of paths in Sk which start
at x0 ∈Sk. As we saw in Chapter 6 evaluation at the endpoint deﬁnes a
ﬁbration P →Sk with ﬁber the loop space ΩSk. Moreover the path space
P is contractible.
The spectral sequence for this ﬁbration (using homology with integer
coeﬃcients for G∗) has E2
p,q = Hp(Sk; Hq(ΩSk)). The coeﬃcients are un-
twisted since π1(Sk) = 0. Therefore
E2
p,q =

Hq(ΩSk)
if p = 0 or p = k,
0
otherwise.
(9.1)
In particular this is a ﬁrst-quadrant spectral sequence.
Since Hn(P) = 0 for all n ̸= 0, the ﬁltration of Hn(P) is trivial for n > 0
and so E∞
p,q = 0 if p + q > 0. Since this is a ﬁrst-quadrant spectral sequence,
E∞
p,q = 0 for all (p, q) ̸= (0, 0), and, furthermore, given any (p, q) ̸= (0, 0),
Er
p,q = 0 for some r large enough.
Now here’s the cool part. Looking at the ﬁgure and keeping in mind
the fact that the bidegree of dr is (−r, r −1), we see that all diﬀerentials
dr : Er
p,q →Er
p−r,q+r−1 either:
1. start or end at a zero group, or
2. r = k and (p, q) = (k, q) with q ≥0, so that
dk : Ek
k,q →Ek
0,q+k−1.

244
9. Spectral Sequences
The following picture shows the Ek-stage and the diﬀerential dk : Ek

p,q = Ek+1

if (p, q) = (k, q),
Coker dk : Ek

0,q+k−1
if (p, q) = (0, q + k −1),
0
otherwise.
Therefore, the spectral sequence collapses at Ek+1.
Hence dk is an isomorphism, i.e. Ek
k,q ∼= Ek
0,q+k−1 whenever (k, q) ̸= (0, 0)
or q ̸= 1 −k. Using Equations (9.2) and (9.1) we can restate this as
Hq(ΩSk) ∼= Hq+k−1(ΩSk).
Using induction, starting with H0(ΩSk) = 0, we conclude that
Hq(ΩSk) =

9.3. The edge homomorphisms and the transgression
245
Exercise 147. If Sk →Sℓ
f−→Sm is a ﬁbration, then ℓ= 2m −1 and
k = m −1.
(In fact, it is a result of Adams that there are only such
ﬁbrations for m = 1, 2, 4 and 8.)
Returning to our general discussion, notice that Er+1
p,q
and E∞
p,q are sub-
quotients of Er
p,q ; in particular, since E2
p,q ∼= Hp(B; GqF) we conclude the
following fundamental fact.
Theorem 9.7. The associated graded module to the ﬁltration of Gn(E) has
graded summands which are subquotients of Hp(B; Gn−pF).
This fact is the starting point for many spectral sequence calculations.
For example,
Theorem 9.8. If Hp(B; Gn−pF) = 0 for all p, then Gn(E) = 0.
Proof. Since E2
p,n−p = 0 for each p, it follows that E∞
p,n−p = 0 for each p
and so Gn(E) = 0.
9.3. The edge homomorphisms and the
transgression
Before we turn to more involved applications, it is useful to know several
facts about the Leray-Serre-Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence.
These
facts serve to identify certain homomorphisms which arise in the guts of the
spectral sequence with natural maps induced by the inclusion of the ﬁber or
the projection to the base in the ﬁbration.
Lemma 9.9. In the Leray-Serre-Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence there
is a surjection
E2
0,n →E∞
0,n
for all n.
Proof. Notice that
Er+1
0,n =
ker dr : Er
0,n →Er
−r,n+r−1
Im dr : Er
r,n−r+1 →Er
0,n
for
r > 1.
But, since E2
p,q = 0 for p < 0, we must have E2
−r,q = 0 for all q and so also
its subquotient Er
−r,q = 0 for all q.
Hence (ker dr : Er
0,n →Er
−r,n+r−1) = Er
0,n and so
Er+1
0,n = Er
0,n
Im dr .
Thus each Er
0,n surjects to Er+1
0,n and hence also to the limit E∞
0,n.

246
9. Spectral Sequences
Proposition 5.14 says that that if V is any local coeﬃcient system over
a path connected space B, then
H0(B; V ) = V
*
⟨v −α · v | v ∈V, α ∈π1B⟩.
Applying this to V = Gn(F), it follows that there is a surjection
Gn(F) →H0(B; GnF).
(9.4)
We can now use the spectral sequence to construct a homomorphism
G∗(F) →G∗(E). Theorem 9.10 below asserts that this homomorphism is
just the homomorphism induced by the inclusion of the ﬁber into the total
space.
Since F−1,n−1 = 0,
E∞
0,n ∼= F0,n/F−1,n+1 = F0,n ⊂Gn(E).
This inclusion can be precomposed with the surjections of Lemma 9.9 and
Equation (9.4) to obtain a homomorphism (called an edge homomorphism)
Gn(F) →H0(B; GnF) ∼= E2
0,n →E∞
0,n ⊂Gn(E).
(9.5)
Theorem 9.10. The edge homomorphism given by (9.5) equals the map
i∗: Gn(F) →Gn(E) induced by the inclusion i : F →E by the homology
theory G∗.
Another simple application of the spectral sequence is to compute ori-
ented bordism groups of a space in low dimensions. We apply the Leray-
Serre-Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence to the ﬁbration pt →X
Id
−→X,
and take G∗= ΩSO
∗, oriented bordism.
In this case the Leray-Serre-Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence says
Hp(X; ΩSO
q
(pt)) ⇒ΩSO
p+q(X).
Notice that the coeﬃcients are untwisted; this is because the ﬁbration is
trivial. Write ΩSO
n
= ΩSO
n (pt). Note that pt →X is split by the constant
map, hence the edge homomorphism ΩSO
n
→ΩSO
n (X) is a split injection, so
by Theorem 9.10, the diﬀerentials dr : Er
r,n−r+1 →Er
0,n whose targets are
on the vertical edge of the ﬁrst quadrant must be zero, i.e. every element of
E2
0,n survives to E∞
0,n = ΩSO
n .
Recall from Section 8.7 that ΩSO
q
= 0 for q = 1, 2, 3, and ΩSO
q
= Z for
q = 0 and 4. Of course ΩSO
q
= 0 for q < 0. Thus for n = p + q ≤4, the
only (possibly) non-zero terms are E2
n,0 ∼= Hn(X) and E2
0,4 = ΩSO
4 . Hence
E2
p,n−p = E∞
p,n−p for n = 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4. From the spectral sequence one

9.3. The edge homomorphisms and the transgression
247
concludes
ΩSO
n (X) ∼= Hn(X)
for n = 0, 1, 2, 3
ΩSO
4 (X) ∼= Z ⊕H4(X).
It can be shown that the map ΩSO
n (X) →Hn(X) is a Hurewicz map
which takes f : M →X to f∗([M]). In particular this implies that any
homology class in Hn(X) for n = 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 is represented by a map
from an oriented manifold to X. The map ΩSO
4 (X) →Z is the map taking
f : M →X to the signature of M.
We next identify another edge homomorphism which can be constructed
in the same manner as (9.5). The analysis will be slightly more involved
and we will state it only in the case when G∗is ordinary homology with
coeﬃcients in an R-module (we suppress the coeﬃcients).
In this context E2
p,q = Hp(B; HqF) = 0 for q < 0 or p < 0. So E∗
∗,∗is a
ﬁrst-quadrant spectral sequence, i.e. Er
p,q = E∞
p,q = 0 for q < 0 or p < 0.
This implies that the ﬁltration of Hn(E) has ﬁnite length
0 = F−1,n+1 ⊂F0,n ⊂F1,n−1 ⊂· · · ⊂Fn,0 = Hn(E)
since
0 = E∞
p,n−p = Fp,n−p/Fp−1,n−p+1
if p < 0 or n −p < 0.
The second map in the short exact sequence
0 →Fn−1,1 →Fn,0 →E∞
n,0 →0
can thus be thought of as a homomorphism
Hn(E) →E∞
n,0.
(9.6)
Lemma 9.11. There is an inclusion
E∞
n,0 ⊂E2
n,0
for all n.
Proof. Since Er
n+r,1−r = 0 for r > 1,
Er+1
n,0 =
ker dr : Er
n,0 →Er
n−r,r−1
Im dr : Er
n+r,1−r →Er
n,0
= ker dr : Er
n,0 →Er
n−r,r−1.
Thus
· · · ⊂Er+1
n,0 ⊂Er
n,0 ⊂Er−1
n,0 ⊂· · ·
and hence
E∞
n,0 =

Er
n,0 ⊂E2

9. Spectral Sequences
Note that the constant map from the ﬁber F to a point induces a ho-
momorphism Hn(B; H0F) →HnB. If F is path connected, then the local
coeﬃcient system H0F is trivial and Hn(B; H0(F)) = Hn(B) for all n.
Theorem 9.12. The composite map (also called an edge homomorphism)
Hn(E) = Fn,0 →E∞
n,0 ⊂E2
n,0 ∼= Hn(B; H0F) →Hn(B)
is just the map induced on homology by the projection f : E →B of the
ﬁbration.
The long diﬀerential dk : Ek
k,0 →Ek
0,k−1 in the spectral sequence for
a ﬁbration (for ordinary homology) has an alternate geometric interpreta-
tion called the transgression. It is deﬁned as follows. Suppose f : E →B
is a ﬁbration with ﬁber F. Fix k > 0. We assemble the homomorphism
f∗: Hk(E, F) →Hk(B, b0), the isomorphism Hk(B) ∼= Hk(B, b0), and
the connecting homomorphism δ : Hk(E, F) →Hk−1(F) for the long ex-
act sequence of the pair (E, F) to deﬁne a (not well-deﬁned, multi–valued)
function τ : Hk(B)“→”Hk−1(F) as the “composite”
τ : Hk(B) ∼= Hk(B, b0)
f∗
←−Hk(E, F)
δ−→Hk−1(F).
To make this more precise, we take as the domain of τ the image of
f∗: Hk(E, F) →Hk(B, b0) ∼= Hk(B), and as the range of τ the quotient
of Hk−1(F) by δ(ker f∗: Hk(E, F) →Hk(B, b0)). A simple diagram chase
shows τ is well-deﬁned with this choice of domain and range.
Thus the
transgression τ is an honest homomorphism from a subgroup of Hk(B) to a
quotient group of Hk−1(F). Intuitively, the transgression is trying his/her
best to imitate the boundary map in the long exact homotopy sequence for
a ﬁbration (see Theorem 9.15 below).
Assume for simplicity that F is path connected, and consider the diﬀer-
ential
dk : Ek
k,0 →Ek
0,k−1
in the spectral sequence for this ﬁbration (taking G∗= H∗= ordinary
homology).
Its domain, Ek
k,0, is a subgroup of E2
k,0 = Hk(B; H0(F)) =
Hk(B) because all diﬀerentials dr into Ek
k,0 are zero for r < k (this is a
ﬁrst-quadrant spectral sequence) and hence Ek
k,0 is just the intersection of
the kernels of dr : Er
k,0 →Er
k−r,r−1 for r < k.
Similarly the range Ek
0,k−1 of dk : Ek
k,0 →Ek
0,k−1 is a quotient of E2
0,k−1 =
H0(B; Hk−1(F)), which by Proposition 5.14 is just the quotient of Hk−1(F)
by the action of π1(B).
We have shown that like the transgression, the diﬀerential dk : Ek
k,0 →
Ek
0,k−1 has domain identiﬁed with a subgroup of Hk(B) and range a quotient

9.4. Applications of the homology spectral sequence
249
of Hk−1(F).
The following theorem identiﬁes the transgression and this
diﬀerential.
Theorem 9.13 (Transgression Theorem). The diﬀerential dk : Ek
k,0 →Ek
0,k−1
in the spectral sequence of the ﬁbration F →E →B coincides with the
transgression
Hk(B) ⊃domain(τ)
τ−→range(τ) = Hk−1(F)/δ(ker f∗).
The proofs of Theorems 9.10, 9.12, and 9.13 are not hard, but require
an examination of the construction which gives the spectral sequence. We
omit the proofs, but you should look them up when working through the
project for this chapter.
9.4. Applications of the homology spectral
sequence
9.4.1. The ﬁve-term and Serre exact sequences.
Corollary 9.14 (Five-term exact sequence). Suppose that F →E
f−→B is
a ﬁbration with B and F path connected. Then there exists an exact sequence
H2(E)
f∗
−→H2(B)
τ−→H0(B; H1(F)) →H1(E)
f∗
−→H1(B) →0.
The composite of the surjection H1(F) →H0(B; H1(F)) with the map
H0(B; H1(F)) →H1(E) in this exact sequence is the homomorphism induced
by the inclusion F →E, and τ is the transgression.
Proof. Take G∗= H∗(−), ordinary homology, perhaps with coeﬃcients.
The corresponding ﬁrst quadrant spectral sequence has
E2
p,q ∼= Hp(B; HqF)
and converges to H∗(E).
The local coeﬃcient system π1B →Aut(H0(F)) is trivial since F is path
connected. Thus E2
p,0 = Hp(B; H0(F)) = Hp(B).
The following facts either follow immediately from the statement of The-
orem 9.6 or are easy to verify, using the bigrading of the diﬀerentials and
the fact that the spectral sequence is a ﬁrst–quadrant spectral sequence.
1. H1(B) ∼= E2
1,0 = Er
1,0 = E∞
1,0 for all r ≥2.

The last two facts give an exact sequence
0 →E∞
2,0 →E2

0,1 →0.
or, making the appropriate substitutions, the exact sequence
0 →E∞
2,0 →H2(B) →H0(B; H1(F)) →E∞
0,1 →0.
(9.7)
Since the spectral sequence converges to H∗(E), and the E∞
p,n−p form
the associated graded groups for Hn(E), the two sequences
0 →E∞
0,1 →H1(E) →E∞
1,0 →0
(9.8)
and
E∞
1,1 →H2(E) →E∞
2,0 →0
(9.9)
are exact.
Splicing the sequences (9.7), (9.8), and (9.9) together and using the ﬁrst
fact above one obtains the exact sequence
E∞
1,1 →H2(E) →H2(B) →H0(B; H1(F)) →H1(E) →H1(B) →0.
In this sequence the homomorphism Hi(E) →Hi(B) is the edge homo-
morphism and hence is induced by the ﬁbration f : E →B.
The map
H0(B; H1(F)) →H2(E) composes with H1(F) →H0(B; H1(F)) to give the
other edge homomorphism, induced by the inclusion of the ﬁber. The map
H2(B) →H0(B; H1(F)) is the transgression.
These assertions follow by
chasing deﬁnitions and using Theorems 9.10, 9.12 and 9.13.
We have seen, beginning with our study of the Puppe sequences, that
coﬁbrations give exact sequences in homology and ﬁbrations give exact se-
quences in homotopy. One might say that a map is a “ﬁbration or coﬁbration
in some range” if there are partial long exact sequences. Corollary 9.14 im-
plies that if π1B acts trivially on H1(F), then the ﬁbration is a coﬁbration
in a certain range. A more general result whose proof is essentially identical
to that of Corollary 9.14 is given in the following important theorem.
Theorem 9.15 (Serre exact sequence). Let F
i−→E
f−→B be a ﬁbration
with B and F path connected and with π1B acting trivially on H∗F. Suppose
HpB = 0 for 0 < p < m and HqF = 0 for 0 < q < n. Then there is an

To understand this result, suppose B is (m −1)-connected and F is
(n −1)-connected. The long exact sequence for a ﬁbration shows that E
is (min(m, n) −1)-connected, so that by the Hurewitz theorem, HqE =
0 for q < min(m, n).
So trivially the low-dimensional part of the Serre
exact sequence is exact; indeed all groups are zero for q < min(m, n). The
remarkable fact is that the sequence remains exact for all min{m, n} ≤q <
m + n.
9.4.2. Euler characteristics and ﬁbrations. Let k be a ﬁeld. Recall
that the Euler characteristic of a space Z is deﬁned to be the alternating sum
χ(Z) = 
n(−1)nβn(Z; k) of the Betti numbers βn(Z; k) = dimk(Hn(Z; k))
whenever this sum is a ﬁnite sum of ﬁnite ranks. For ﬁnite CW-complexes
it is equal to the alternating sum of the number of n-cells by the following
standard exercise applied to the cellular chain complex.
Exercise 150. Let (C∗, ∂) be a chain complex over a ﬁeld with ⊕iCi ﬁnite-
dimensional. Show that the alternating sum of the ranks of the Ci equals
the alternating sum of the ranks of the cohomology groups Hi(C∗, ∂).
Given a product space E = B × F with B and F ﬁnite CW-complexes,
the K¨unneth theorem implies that the homology with ﬁeld coeﬃcients is a
tensor product
H∗(E; k) ∼= H∗(B; k) ⊗H∗(F; k)
from which it follows that the Euler characteristic is multiplicative
χ(E) = χ(B) · χ(F).
The following theorem extends this formula to the case when E is only a
product locally, i.e. ﬁber bundles, and even to ﬁbrations.
Notice that the homology itself need not be multiplicative for a non-
trivial ﬁbration. For example, consider the Hopf ﬁbration S3 →S7 →S4.
The graded groups H∗(S7; k) and H∗(S3; k) ⊗H∗(S4; k) are not isomorphic,
even though the Euler characteristics multiply (0 = 0 · 2).
Theorem 9.16. Let p : E →B be a ﬁbration with ﬁber F, let k be a ﬁeld,
and suppose the action of π1B on H∗(F; k) is trivial. Assume that the Euler
characteristics χ(B), χ(F) are deﬁned (e.g. if B, F are ﬁnite cell complexes).
Then χ(E) is deﬁned and
χ(E) = χ(B) · χ(F).

252
9. Spectral Sequences
Proof. Since k is a ﬁeld and the action of π1B on H∗(F; k) is trivial,
Hp(B; Hq(F; k)) ∼= Hp(B; k) ⊗k Hq(F; k)
by the universal coeﬃcient theorem.
Theorem 9.6 with G∗= H∗(−; k)
implies that there exists a spectral sequence with
E2
p,q ∼= Hp(B; k) ⊗Hq(F; k).
By hypothesis, E2
p,q is ﬁnite-dimensional over k, and is zero for all but
ﬁnitely many pairs (p, q). This implies that the spectral sequence collapses
at some stage and so E∞
p,q = Er
p,q for r large enough.
Deﬁne
Er
n = ⊕pEr
p,n−p
for each n and r ≥2 including r = ∞.
Then since the Euler characteristic of the tensor product of two graded
vector spaces is the product of the Euler characteristics,
χ(E2
∗) = χ(B)χ(F).
Notice that (Er
∗, dr) is a (singly) graded chain complex with homology Er+1
∗
.
Exercise 150 shows that for any r ≥2,
χ(Er
∗) = χ(H∗(Er
∗, dr)) = χ(Er+1
∗).
Since the spectral sequence collapses χ(E2
∗) = χ(E∞
∗).
Since we are working over a ﬁeld, Hn(E; k) is isomorphic to its associ-
ated graded vector space ⊕pE∞
p,n−p = E∞
n . In particular Hn(E; k) is ﬁnite-
dimensional and dim Hn(E; k) = dim E∞
n .
Therefore,
χ(B)χ(F) = χ(E2
∗) = χ(E∞
∗) = χ(H∗(E; k)) = χ(E).
9.4.3. The homology Gysin sequence.
Theorem 9.17. Let R be a commutative ring. Suppose F →E
f−→B is a
ﬁbration, and suppose F is a R-homology n-sphere, i.e.
Hi(F; R) ∼=

R
if i = 0 or n,
0
otherwise.
Assume that π1B acts trivially on Hn(F; R). Then there exists an exact
sequence (R-coeﬃcients):
· · · →HrE
f∗
−→HrB →Hr−n−1B →Hr−1E
f∗
−→Hr−1B →· · ·

9.4. Applications of the homology spectral sequence
253
Proof. The spectral sequence for the ﬁbration (using ordinary homology
with R-coeﬃcients) has
E2
p,q ∼= Hp(B; HqF) =

Hp(B; R)
if q = 0 or n,
0
otherwise.
The following diagram shows the E2-stage. The two shaded rows (q = 0
and q = n) are the only rows that might contain a non-zero E2
p,q.

Thus the only possibly non-zero diﬀerentials are

It follows that

p,q ∼= Hp(B; HqF) =

The ﬁltration of Hr(E) reduces to

Exercise 151. Derive the Wang sequence. If F →E →Sn is a ﬁbration
over Sn, then there is an exact sequence

9.5. The cohomology spectral sequence
The examples in the previous section show that spectral sequences are a
useful tool for establishing relationships between the homology groups of
the three spaces forming a ﬁbration. Much better information can often be
obtained by using the ring structure on cohomology. We next introduce the
cohomology spectral sequence and relate the ring structures on cohomology
and the spectral sequence. The ring structure makes the cohomology spec-
tral sequence a much more powerful computational tool than the homology
spectral sequence.
Deﬁnition 9.18. A bigraded spectral sequence (Ep,q
r , dr) is called a coho-
mology spectral sequence if the diﬀerential dr has bidgree (r, 1 −r).
Notice the change in placement of the indices in the cohomology spectral
sequence. The contravariance of cohomology makes it necessary to change
the notion of a ﬁltration.
There is a formal way to do this, namely by
“lowering indices”, for example rewrite Hp(X) as H−p(X), rewrite F p as
F−p, replace Ep,q
r
by Er
−p,−q and so forth. Unfortunately for this to work
the notion of convergence of a spectral sequence has to be modiﬁed; with the
deﬁnition we gave above the cohomology spectral sequence of a ﬁbration will
not converge. Rather than extending the formalism and making the notion
of convergence technically more complicated, we will instead just make new
deﬁnitions which apply in the cohomology setting.
Deﬁnition 9.19. A (cohomology) ﬁltration of an R-module A is an increas-
ing union
0 ⊂· · · ⊂F p ⊂· · · ⊂F 2 ⊂F 1 ⊂F 0 ⊂F −1 ⊂· · · ⊂A.
of submodules. A ﬁltration is convergent if the union of the Fp’s is A and
their intersection is 0.

9.5. The cohomology spectral sequence
255
If A itself is graded, then the ﬁltration is assumed to preserve the grading
i.e. F p ∩An ⊂F p−1 ∩An. If A is graded, then we bigrade the ﬁltration by
setting
F p,q = F p ∩Ap+q.
Deﬁnition 9.20. Given a cohomology ﬁltration F = {F n} of an R-module
A the associated graded module is the graded R-module denoted by Gr(A, F)
and deﬁned by
Gr(A, F)p =
F p
F p+1 .
Deﬁnition 9.21. Given a bigraded cohomology spectral sequence (Ep,q
r , dr),
and a graded R-module A∗, we say the spectral sequence converges to A∗and
write
Ep,q
2
⇒Ap+q
if:
1. for each (p, q) there exists an r0 so that dr : Ep−r,q+r−1
r
→Ep,q
r
is zero
for all r ≥r0; in particular there is an injection Ep,q
r+1 →Ep,q
r
for all
r ≥r0, and
2. there is a convergent ﬁltration of A∗, so that for each n, the limit
Ep,q
∞= ∩r≥r0Ep,q
r
is isomorphic to the associated graded Gr(A∗)p.
Theorem 9.22. Let F →E
f−→B be a ﬁbration, with B a path connected
CW-complex. Let G∗be an additive cohomology theory. Assume either that
B is a ﬁnite-dimensional CW-complex or else that there exists an N so that
Gq(F) = 0 for all q < N. Notice that π1(B) acts on Gq(F) determining a
local coeﬃcient system.
Then there exists a (cohomology) spectral sequence
Hp(B; GqF) ∼= Ep,q
2
⇒Gp+q(E).
There is a version of this theorem which applies to inﬁnite CW-complexes,
see [43].
Exercise 152. State and prove the cohomology versions of the Serre, Gysin,
and Wang sequences. Construct the cohomology edge homomorphisms and
the cohomology transgression and state the analogues of Theorems 9.10,
9.12, and 9.13.
As an example we show how to compute the complex K-theory of com-
plex projective space CP k (see Section 8.8.4 and the project for Chapter
8). The computation of complex K-theory was the original motivation for
Atiyah-Hirzebruch to set up their spectral sequence. Complex K-theory is

256
9. Spectral Sequences
a cohomology theory satisfying Kn(X) = Kn+2(X), and its coeﬃcients are
given by
K2n(pt) = π0(Z × BU) = Z
and
K2n+1(pt) = π1(Z × BU) = 0.
Theorem 9.22, applied to the trivial ﬁbration
pt →CP k
Id
−→CP k,
says there exists a cohomology spectral sequence Ep,q
r
satisfying
Hp(CP k; Kq(pt)) ∼= Ep,q
2
⇒Kp+q(CP k).
The coeﬃcients are untwisted since the ﬁbration is trivial. Since
Hp(CP k) =

Z
if p is even, 0 ≤p ≤2k
0
otherwise,
it follows that
Ep,q
2
=

Z
if p and q are even, 0 ≤p ≤2k
0
otherwise.
This checkerboard pattern forces every diﬀerential to be zero, since one
of the integers (r, 1 −r) must be odd! Notice, by the way, that this is not
a ﬁrst-quadrant spectral sequence since the K-theory of a point is non-zero
in positive and negative dimensions.
Therefore Ep,q
2
= Ep,q
∞and the associated graded group to Kn(CP k),
⊕pEp,n−p
∞
, is a direct sum of k + 1 copies of Z, one for each pair (p, q) so
that p + q = n, both p and q are even, and 0 ≤p ≤2k. Inducting down the
ﬁltration we see that Kn(CP k) has no torsion and hence is isomorphic to
its associated graded group. Therefore
Kn(CP k) =

Zk+1
if n is even,
0
otherwise.
To study the multiplicative properties of the cohomology spectral se-
quence, take G∗to be ordinary cohomology with coeﬃcients in a commuta-
tive ring R : G∗(E) = H∗(E; R). Let F →E →B be a ﬁbration. To avoid
working with cup products with local coeﬃcients, we assume that π1B acts
trivially on H∗(F).
Lemma 9.23. Hp(B; HqF) ∼= Ep,q
2
is a bigraded algebra over R.

9.5. The cohomology spectral sequence
257
Proof. The cup product on H∗B induces a bilinear map
Hp(B; HqF) × Hr(B; HsF) →Hp+r(B; HqF ⊗HsF).
Composing with the coeﬃcient homomorphism induced by the cup product
on H∗(F)
Hq(F) ⊗Hs(F) →Hq+s(F)
gives the desired multiplication
Ep,q
2 ⊗Er,s
2 =Hp(B; HqF)⊗Hr(B; HsF)→Hp+r(B; Hq+sF)=Ep+r,q+s
2
.
In many contexts the map E∗,0
2
⊗E0,∗
2
→E∗,∗
2
is an isomorphism. The-
orem 2.33 can be quite useful in this regard, For example if R is a ﬁeld
and B and F are simply connected ﬁnite CW-complexes then the map is an
isomorphism.
Theorem 9.24. The (Leray-Serre) cohomology spectral sequence of the ﬁ-
bration is a spectral sequence of R-algebras. More precisely:
1. E∗,∗
t
is a bigraded R-algebra, i.e. there are products
Ep,q
t
× Er,s
t
→Ep+r,q+s
t
.
2. dt : Et →Et is a derivation. This means that if a ∈Ep,q
t
, b ∈Er,s
t
dt(a · b) = (dta) · b + (−1)p+qa · dtb.
(9.11)
3. The product on Et+1 is induced from the one on Et (see Exercise 153
below) starting with the product on E2 given by cup products, as in
Lemma 9.23.
4. The following two ring structures on E∞coincide. (This assertion is
a compatibility condition which relates the cup products on B, F, and
E.)
(a) Make E∗,∗
∞
a bigraded R-algebra by using that each (a, b) ∈
Ep,q
∞× Er,s
∞is represented by an element of Ep,q
t
× Er,s
t
for t
large enough.
(b) The (usual) cup product
∪: H∗(E) × H∗(E) →H∗(E)
is “ﬁltration preserving”, i.e. the diagram
F p,q × F r,s
F p+r,q+s

commutes (this comes from the construction of the ﬁltration),
and so this cup product induces a product on the associated
graded module, i.e. on E∞. (see Exercise 154).
Exercise 153. Suppose that E is a graded ring and d : E →E is a dif-
ferential (d2 = 0) and a derivation (Equation 9.11), then show that the
cohomology H∗(E, d) inherits a graded ring structure.
Exercise 154. Show that a ﬁltration-preserving multiplication on a ﬁltered
algebra induces a multiplication on the associated graded algebra.
Proposition 9.25. The rational cohomology ring of K(Z, n) is a polyno-
mial ring on one generator if n is even and a truncated polynomial ring one
one generator (in fact an exterior algebra on one generator) if n is odd:
H∗(K(Z, n); Q) =

Q[ιn]
if n is even,
Q[ιn]/ι2
n
if n is odd
where deg(ιn) = n.
Proof. We induct on n. For n = 1, K(Z, 1) = S1 which has cohomology
ring Z[ι1]/ι2
1.
Suppose the theorem is true for k < n. Consider the Leray–Serre spec-
tral sequence for path space ﬁbration K(Z, n −1) →P →K(Z, n) for
cohomology with rational coeﬃcients. Then
Ep,q
2
= Hp(K(Z, n); Q) ⊗Q Hq(K(Z, n −1); Q) ⇒Hp+q(P; Q).
Since Hp+q(P; Q) = 0 for (p, q) ̸= (0, 0), The diﬀerential
dn : E0,n−1
n
→En,0
n
must be an isomorphism.
Since E0,n−1
n
= Hn−1(K(Z, n −1); Q) ∼= Q,
generated by ιn−1, and En,0
n
= En,0
2
= Hn(K(Z, n); Q) ∼= Q, generated by
ιn, it follows that dn(ιn−1) is a non-zero multiple of ιn. By rescaling the
generator ιn by a rational number assume inductively that dn(ιn−1) = ιn.
Consider the cases n even and n odd separately. If n is even, then since
Hq(K(Z, n −1); Q) = 0 unless q = 0 or n −1, Ep,q
2
= 0 unless q = 0
or n −1. This implies that 0 = Ep,q
∞= Ep,q
n+1 for (p, q) ̸= (0, 0) and the
derivation property of dn says that dn(ιn−1ιr
n) = ιr+1
n
which, by induction
on r, is non-zero. It follows easily from 0 = Ep,q
∞= Ep,q
n+1 for (p, q) ̸= (0, 0)
that Hp(K(Z, n); Q) = 0 if p is not a multiple of n, and is isomorphic to Q
for p = nr. Since ιr
n is non-zero it generates Hnr(K(Z, n); Q) ∼= Q and so
H∗(K(Z, n); Q) is a polynomial ring on ιn as required.

9.5. The cohomology spectral sequence
259
If n is odd, the derivation property of dn implies that
dn(ι2
n−1) = dn(ιn−1)ιn−1 + (−1)n−1ιn−1dn(ιn−1) = 2ιn−1ιn.
Hence dn : E0,2n−2
n
→En,n−1
2
is an isomorphism. More generally by induc-
tion one sees that dn(ιr
n−1) = rιnιr−1
n−1, so that dn : E0,r(n−1)
n
→En,(r−1)(n−1)
2
is an isomorphism. It is then easy to see that the spectral sequence collapses
at En+1, and hence Hp(K(Z, n); Q) = Q for p = 0 or n and zero otherwise.
We will show how to use Theorem 154 to compute π4S3. This famous
theorem was ﬁrst proven by G.W. Whitehead and Rohlin (independently).
The argument is eﬀortless using spectral sequences.
Theorem 9.26. π4S3 = Z/2.
Proof. Since Z = H3(S3) = [S3, K(Z, 3)] , choose a map f : S3 →K(Z, 3)
representing the generator. For example, K(Z, 3) can be obtained by adding
5 cells, 6 cells, etc. to S3 inductively to kill all the higher homotopy groups
of S3 and then f can be taken to be the inclusion. The Hurewicz theorem
implies that f∗: π3S3 →π3(K(Z, 3)) is an isomorphism.
Pull back the ﬁbration
K(Z, 2) →∗→K(Z, 3)
(this is shorthand for ΩK(Z, 3) →P →K(Z, 3) where P is the contractible
path space) via f to get a ﬁbration
K(Z, 2) →X →S3.
(9.12)
Alternatively, let X be the homotopy ﬁber of f, i.e. X →S3 →K(Z, 3)
is a ﬁbration up to homotopy. Then ΩK(Z, 3) ∼K(Z, 2) is the homotopy
ﬁber of X →S3 by Theorem 6.40. (We will use the ﬁbration (9.12) again
in Chapter 10.)
In the long exact homotopy sequence for a ﬁbration, ∂: π3S3
∼
=
−→
π2(K(Z, 2)). Hence
πkX =

0
if k ≤3,
πkS3
if k > 3.
In particular, H4X = π4X = π4S3. We will try to compute H4X using a
spectral sequence.
Consider the cohomology spectral sequence for the ﬁbration (9.12). Then
Ep,q
2
= Hp(S3; HqK(Z, 2)). Recall that K(Z, 2) is the inﬁnite complex pro-
jective space CP ∞whose cohomology algebra is the 1-variable polynomial
ring H∗(K(Z, 2)) = Z[c] where deg(c) = 2.

260
9. Spectral Sequences
Exercise 155. Give another proof of the fact that H∗(K(Z, 2)) = Z[c]
using the spectral sequence for the path space ﬁbration
K(Z, 1) →∗→K(Z, 2)
and the identiﬁcation of K(Z, 1) with S1. (Hint: the argument is contained
in the proof of Proposition 9.25.)
Let i ∈H3(S3) denote the generator. Then the E2-stage in the spectral
sequence is indicated in the following diagram. The labels mean that the
groups in question are inﬁnite cyclic with the indicated generators. The
empty entries are zero. The entries in this table are computed using Lemma
9.23.

Since H2X = 0 = H3X it follows that d3c = i. Therefore,

This implies that Z/2 ∼= E3,2
4
= E3,2
∞∼= H5X and 0 = E0,4
4

∞= H4X.
The universal coeﬃcient theorem implies that H4X = Z/2. We conclude
that Z/2 ∼= π4X = π4S3, as desired.
Corollary 9.27. πn+1Sn = Z/2 for all n ≥3. In particular, πS
1 = Z/2.
Proof. This is an immediate consequence of the Freudenthal suspension
theorem (Theorem 8.7).
Corollary 9.28. π4S2 = Z/2.

9.6. Homology of groups
261
Proof. Apply the long exact sequence of homotopy groups to the Hopf
ﬁbration S1 →S3 →S2.
The reader should think about the strategy used to make these compu-
tations. On the one hand ﬁbrations were used to relate homotopy groups of
various spaces; on the other spectral sequences are used to compute homol-
ogy groups. The Hurewitz theorem is then used to conclude that a homology
group computation in fact gives a homotopy group computation.
9.6. Homology of groups
Deﬁnition 9.29. Let G be a group. Deﬁne the cohomology of G with Z
coeﬃcients by
Hk(G; Z) = Hk(K(G, 1); Z).
Similarly deﬁne the homology of G
Hk(G; Z) = Hk(K(G, 1); Z).
More generally deﬁne the homology and cohomology of G with coeﬃ-
cients in any R-module A to be the corresponding homology or cohomology
of K(G, 1).
Corollary 7.27 implies that the homology and cohomology of a group are
well-deﬁned. Moreover, the assignment G →K(G, 1) is functorial and takes
short exact sequences to ﬁbrations. (The functoriality can be interpreted
in two diﬀerent ways.
For every group one associates a homotopy type
of spaces, and a group homomorphism leads to a homotopy class of maps
between the spaces. Alternatively, one can construct an honest functor from
the category of groups to the category of spaces by giving a speciﬁc model
of K(G, 1) related to the bar resolution in homological algebra.)
Groups are very mysterious nonabelian things and thus are hard to
study.
Homology of groups gives abelian invariants, and has been very
useful in group theory as well as topology.
It follows that to understand the homology of groups related by exact
sequences amounts to understanding the homology of a ﬁbration, for which,
as we have seen, spectral sequences are a good tool.
It is easy to see that K(A × B, 1) = K(A, 1) × K(B, 1), and so the
K¨unneth theorem can be used to compute the cohomology of products of
groups. Therefore the following result is all that is needed to obtain a com-
plete computation of the cohomology of ﬁnitely generated abelian groups.

9. Spectral Sequences
Theorem 9.30. The cohomology of Z/n is given by
Hq(Z/n; Z) =





Z
if q = 0,
0
if q is odd, and
Z/n
if q > 0 is even.
Proof. The exact sequence 0 →Z
×n
−−→Z →Z/n →0 induces a ﬁbration
sequence
K(Z, 2) →K(Z, 2) →K(Z/n, 2)
(see Proposition 7.28). By looping this ﬁbration twice (i.e. taking iterated
homotopy ﬁbers twice; see Theorem 6.40) we obtain the ﬁbration
K(Z, 1) →K(Z/n, 1) →K(Z, 2).
The ﬁber K(Z, 1) is a circle.
Consider the spectral sequence for this ﬁbration. The base is simply
connected so there is no twisting in the coeﬃcients. Notice that
Ep,q
2
= Hp(K(Z, 2); HqS1) =

0
if q > 1, and
Hp(K(Z, 2); Z)
if q = 0 or 1.
Using Lemma 9.23, the E2-stage is given by the following table, with the
empty entries equal to 0 and the others inﬁnite cyclic with the indicated
generators (where i is the generator of H1(S1)).

Of course d2(i) = kc for some integer k, and the question is: what might
k be? We can ﬁnd out by “peeking at the answer.” Since E0,2
∞= 0 = E1,1
∞,
we see that H2(K(Z/n, 1)) = E2,0
∞∼= Z/k. Since π1(K(Z/n, 1)) = Z/n, by
the universal coeﬃcient theorem, we see that H2 must be Z/n and hence
k = ±n. (Neat, huh?)
Let c be the image of c in E2,0

From this we see that the spectral sequence collapses at E3, and that as
graded rings E∗,0
∞∼= H∗(K(Z/n, 1)). This not only completes the proof of
the theorem, but also computes the cohomology ring
H∗(K(Z/n, 1)) = Z[¯c]

⟨n¯c⟩.
Also, we can get the homology from the cohomology by using the uni-
versal coeﬃcient theorem:
Hq(Z/n) =

if q = 0,
Z/n
if q is odd, and

if q > 0 is even.
In applications, it is important to know the mod p-cohomology ring
(which is the mod p-cohomology ring on an inﬁnite-dimensional lens space).
By the K¨unneth theorem (which implies that, with ﬁeld coeﬃcients, H∗(X×
Y ) ∼= H∗(X) ⊗H∗(Y )), it suﬃces to consider the case where n is a prime
power. Let Fp denote the ﬁeld Z/pZ for a prime p.
Exercise 156. Show that H∗(Z/2; F2) ∼= F2[a] where a has degree one,
and if pk ̸= 2, H∗(Z/pk; Fp) ∼= Λ(a) ⊗Fp[b], where a has degree one and b
has degree 2. Here Λ(a) is the 2-dimensional graded algebra over Fp with
Λ(a)0 ∼= Fp with generator 1, and Λ(a)1 ∼= Fp with generator a. (Hint: Use
RP ∞= K(Z/2, 1) and that a · a = −a · a for a ∈H1.)
Exercise 157. Compute Hp(K(Z/2, n); Z/2) for as many p and n as you
can. Hint: try induction on n, using the ﬁbration
K(Z/2, n) →∗→K(Z/2, n + 1).
9.7. Homology of covering spaces
Suppose that f : ˜X →X is a regular cover of a path connected space X.
Letting G = π1(X)/f∗(π1( ˜X)), f : ˜X →X is a principal G-bundle (with G

discrete). Thus G →˜X →X is pulled back from the universal G-bundle
G →EG →BG (see Theorem 8.22). In other words, there is a diagram
G

It follows that the sequence
˜X →X →BG
is a ﬁbration (up to homotopy). (One way to see this is to consider the Borel
ﬁbration ˜X →˜X ×G EG →X. Since G acts freely on ˜X, there is another
ﬁbration EG →˜X ×GEG →X/G. Since EG is contractible we see that the
total space of the Borel ﬁbration is homotopy equivalent to X.) Since G is
discrete, BG = K(G, 1). Applying the homology (or cohomology) spectral
sequence to this ﬁbration immediately gives the following spectral sequence
of a covering space (we use the notation H∗(G) = H∗(K(G, 1))).
Theorem 9.31. Given a regular cover f : ˜X →X with group of covering
automorphisms G = π1(X)/f∗(π1( ˜X)), there is a homology spectral sequence
Hp(G; Hq( ˜X)) ∼= E2
p,q ⇒Hp+q(X)
and a cohomology spectral sequence
Hp(G; Hq( ˜X)) ∼= Ep,q
2
⇒Hp+q(X).
The twisting of the coeﬃcients is just the one induced by the action of G on
˜X by covering transformations.
Applying the ﬁve-term exact sequence (Corollary 9.14) in this context
gives the very useful exact sequence
H2(X) →H2(G) →H0(G; H1( ˜X)) →H1(X) →H1(G) →0.
Exercise 158. Use the spectral sequence of the universal cover to show
that for a path connected space X the sequence
π2(X)
ρ−→H2(X) →H2(π1(X)) →0
is exact, where ρ denotes the Hurewicz map.

9.8. Relative spectral sequences
265
As an application we examine the problem of determining which ﬁnite
groups G can act freely on Sk.
Equivalently, what are the fundamental
groups of manifolds covered by the k-sphere? First note that if g : Sk →Sk
is a ﬁxed-point free map then g is homotopic to the antipodal map (can you
remember how to prove this?), and so is orientation-preserving if k is odd
and orientation-reversing if k is even. Thus if k is even, the composite of
any two non-trivial elements of G must be trivial, from which it follows that
G has 1 or 2 elements. We shall henceforth assume k is odd, and hence that
G acts by orientation-preserving ﬁxed-point free homeomorphisms.
Thus the cohomology spectral sequence for the cover has
Ep,q
2
=

Hp(G; Hq(Sk)) = Hp(G)
if q = 0 or q = k,
0
otherwise
and converges to Hp+q(Sk/G). This implies that the only possible non-zero
diﬀerentials are
dk : Ep,k
k+1 →Ep−k−1,0
k+1
and that the spectral sequence collapses at Ek+2.
Notice that Sk/G is a compact manifold of dimension k, and in particular
Hn(Sk/G) = 0 for n > k. This forces Ep,q
∞= 0 whenever p + q > k. Hence
the diﬀerentials dk : Ep,k
k+1 →Ep+k+1,0
k+1
are isomorphisms for p ≥1, and since
these are the only possible non-zero diﬀerentials we have
Ep,k
k+1 = Ep,k
2
∼= Hp(G) and Ep+k+1,0
k+1
= Ep+k+1,0
2
∼= Hp+k+1(G)
so that Hp(G) ∼= Hp+k+1(G) for p ≥1.
Thus G has periodic cohomology with period k + 1. Any subgroup of G
also acts freely on Sk by restricting the action. This implies the following
theorem.
Theorem 9.32. If the ﬁnite group G acts freely on an odd-dimensional
sphere Sk, then every subgroup of G has periodic cohomology of period k+1.
As an application, ﬁrst note the group Z/p×Z/p does not have periodic
cohomology; this can be checked using the K¨unneth theorem. We conclude
that any ﬁnite group acting freely on a sphere cannot contain a subgroup
isomorphic to Z/p × Z/p.
9.8. Relative spectral sequences
In studying maps of ﬁbrations, it is useful to have relative versions of the ho-
mology and cohomology spectral sequence theorems. There are two relative
versions, one involving a subspace of the base and one involving a subspace
of the ﬁber.

10.1. Serre classes of abelian groups
Deﬁnition 10.1. A Serre class of abelian groups is a nonempty collection
C of abelian groups satisfying:
1. If 0 →A →B →C →0 is a short exact sequence, then B ∈C if and
only if A, C ∈C.
Moreover, there are additional axioms which can be useful:
2A. If A, B ∈C, then A ⊗B ∈C and Tor(A, B) ∈C.
2B. If A ∈C, then A ⊗B ∈C for any abelian group B.
3. If A ∈C, then Hn(A; Z) = Hn(K(A, 1); Z) is in C for every n > 0.
Exercise 159. Prove that Axiom 2B implies Axiom 2A. (Hint: Show that
Tor(A, B) ⊂A ⊗F for some F.)
There are many examples of Serre classes, including the trivial class,
the class of all abelian groups, the class of torsion abelian groups, torsion
abelian groups such that no element is pr-torsion for a ﬁxed prime p, the
class of ﬁnite abelian groups, and the class of abelian p-groups. You should
think about which of the axioms these classes satisfy.
It suﬃces for our exposition to consider the following two examples.
1. The class CFG of ﬁnitely generated abelian groups. Axioms 1, 2A
clearly hold (see Exercise 28 and the remark preceding it).
Note,
however, that Z ∈CFG, but Z⊗Q is not in CFG, so 2B does not hold.
267

268
10. Further Applications of Spectral Sequences
Axiom 3 follows from Theorem 9.30, the K¨unneth theorem, and the
fact that K(Z, 1) = S1.
2. Let P denote a subset of the set of all prime numbers. Let CP denote
the class of torsion abelian groups A so that no element of A has order
a positive power of p for p ∈P. Thus for example, if P is empty then
CP is the class of all torsion abelian groups. If P denotes all primes
then CP is the class containing only the trivial group. If P consists of
the single prime p then we use the notation Cp for CP .
We will show that the class CP satisﬁes Axioms 1, 2B, and 3. First some
terminology: given a prime p, the p-primary subgroup of an abelian group
consists of the subgroup of those elements whose order is a power of p. Thus
CP consists of those torsion abelian groups whose p-primary subgroup is
trivial for any p ∈P.
Lemma 10.2. The class CP satisﬁes Axioms 1, 2B, and 3.
Proof. Say that an integer n ̸= 0 is prime to P if p does not divide n for
all p ∈P. Then an abelian group A is in CP if and only if for all a ∈A,
there is an n prime to P so that na = 0.
We ﬁrst prove axiom 1. Let 0 →A
α
−→B
β−→C →0 be an exact sequence
of abelian groups. If B ∈CP , then for a ∈A, there is an n prime to P so
that nα(a) = 0. Hence na = 0, and so A ∈CP . If B ∈CP , then for c ∈C,
choose b ∈β−1(c), and n prime to P so that nb = 0. Then nc = nβ(b) = 0
and hence C ∈CP . Conversely assume A, C ∈CP . Then for b ∈B, there
exists an n prime to P so that nβ(b) = 0. By exactness nb = α(a) for some
a. Choose m prime to P so that ma = 0. Then mnb = mα(a) = 0, so
B ∈CP .
Next comes Axiom 2B. Suppose that A ∈CP and let B be an arbitrary
abelian group. Pick an element t = 
i ai ⊗bi ∈A ⊗B. Since A ∈CP , we
can ﬁnd integers ni prime to P so that niai = 0. Let n =  ni; this is prime
to P and nt = 0. Thus A ⊗B ∈CP .
We turn to the proof of Axiom 3. Let A ∈CP . Suppose ﬁrst that A is
ﬁnitely generated. Then A is isomorphic to the ﬁnite direct sum of cyclic
groups A ∼= ⊕i Z/pri
i
where pi ̸∈P.
Using Theorem 9.30, the K¨unneth
theorem, and induction it follows that Hn(K(A, 1); Z) is a ﬁnitely generated
torsion abelian group with trivial p-primary subgroup for any p ∈P.
Next let A ∈CP be arbitrary and pick an α ∈Hn(K(A, 1); Z). Choose
a cycle z representing the homology class α. Since z is a ﬁnite sum of sin-
gular simplices there is a ﬁnite subcomplex X ⊂K(A, 1) containing the
image of every singular simplex in z.
Therefore α lies in the image of
Hn(X) →Hn(K(A, 1)). Let A′ ⊂A denote the ﬁnitely generated subgroup
Im (π1(X) →π1(K(A, 1))). Since π1(K(A, 1)) = A ∈CP , the subgroup A′

10.1. Serre classes of abelian groups
269
is also in CP . The space K(A′, 1) can be constructed by adding k-cells to X
for k ≥2 and since A′ →A is injective the inclusion X ⊂K(A, 1) can be
extended to give the commutative diagram
X
K(A, 1)
K(A′, 1).
✲

✸
Thus α ∈Im (Hn(K(A′, 1)) →Hn(K(A, 1))) and since A′ is ﬁnitely
generated, α is torsion with order relatively prime to p for p ∈P. Thus
Hn(K(A, 1)) ∈CP .
Deﬁnition 10.3. Given a Serre class C, a homomorphism ϕ : A →B
between two abelian groups is called:
1. a C-monomorphism if ker ϕ ∈C,
2. a C-epimorphism if coker ϕ ∈C, and
3. a C-isomorphism if ker ϕ ∈C and coker ϕ ∈C.
Two abelian groups A and B are called C-isomorphic if there exists an
abelian group C and two C-isomorphisms f : C →A and g : C →B.
Lemma 10.4. Let α : A →B and β : B →C be homomorphisms of abelian
groups. If two of the three maps α, β, and β ◦α are C-isomorphisms, then
so is the third.
Proof. This follows from the exact sequence
0 →ker α →ker β ◦α
α
−→ker β →coker α
β−→coker β ◦α →coker β →0.
We will sometimes write A ∼= B mod C to indicate that A and B are
C-isomorphic.
Exercise 160. Let Cφ be the class of torsion abelian groups. Show that
A ∼= B mod Cφ if and only if A ⊗Q ∼= B ⊗Q.
Exercise 161. Prove the ﬁve-lemma “mod C.”
The Hurewicz theorem has the following extremely useful generalization.
Theorem 10.5.
1. (mod C Hurewicz theorem) Let X be 1-connected, and suppose C sat-
isﬁes Axioms 1, 2A, and 3.
(a) If πiX ∈C for all i < n, then HiX ∈C for all 0 < i < n and
the Hurewicz map πnX →HnX is a C-isomorphism.

270
10. Further Applications of Spectral Sequences
(b) If HiX ∈C for all 0 < i < n, then πiX ∈C for all i < n and
the Hurewicz map πnX →HnX is a C-isomorphism.
2. (mod C relative Hurewicz theorem) Suppose A ⊂X, A and X are
1-connected, and π2(X, A) = 0. Suppose C satisﬁes Axioms 1, 2B,
and 3.
(a) If πi(X, A) ∈C for all i < n, then Hi(X, A) ∈C for all
i < n and the Hurewicz map πn(X, A) →Hn(X, A) is a C-
isomorphism.
(b) If Hi(X, A) ∈C for all i < n, then πi(X, A) ∈C for all
i < n and the Hurewicz map πn(X, A) →Hn(X, A) is a C-
isomorphism.
Actually, as you can easily check, the part (b)’s above follow from the
part (a)’s. We will give a proof of the theorem using spectral sequences and
the fact that π1Y →H1Y is an isomorphism when the fundamental group
is abelian. By taking C to be the class consisting of the trivial group, we
obtain proofs of the classical Hurewicz and relative Hurewicz theorems. The
proof we give simpliﬁes a bit in the classical case. A proof of the classical
case without the use of spectral sequences was a project in Chapter 6.
The mod C relative Hurewicz theorem implies the mod C Whitehead
Theorem.
Theorem 10.6 (mod C Whitehead theorem ). Let f : A →X, where A, X
are 1-connected, and suppose f : π2A →π2X is an epimorphism. Let C sat-
isfy Axioms 1, 2B, and 3. Then the following two statements are equivalent.
1. f∗: πiA →πiX is an C-isomorphism for i < n and a C-epimorphism
for i = n.
2. f∗: HiA →HiX is a C-isomorphism for i < n and a C-epimorphism
for i = n.
Exercise 162. Show that Theorem 10.6 follows from Theorem 10.5.
Since the homology groups of a ﬁnite CW-complex are all in CFG, the
mod C Hurewicz theorem has the following important consequence.
Corollary 10.7. If X is a simply connected ﬁnite CW-complex, then all
the homotopy groups of X are ﬁnitely generated. More generally a simply
connected space has ﬁnitely generated homology groups in every dimension
if and only if it has ﬁnitely generated homotopy groups in each dimension.
This sounds great, but we warn you that only time homotopy groups
of a simply connected ﬁnite CW-complex have been computed is when the
complex is contractible.
The hypotheses in the Corollary that X be simply connected is necessary.

Exercise 163. Prove that π2(S1 ∨S2) is not ﬁnitely generated.
Exercise 164. Show that Corollary 10.7 holds more generally when π1X
is ﬁnite.
We turn now to the proof of the Hurewicz theorem.
Proof of Theorem 10.5. Here is the idea of the proof. For a space X,
consider the path ﬁbration
ΩX →PX
f−→X.
There is a commutative diagram
πn(X, x0)

where the vertical maps are Hurewicz maps.
The boundary maps ∂are
isomorphisms since PX is contractible. The top f∗is an isomorphism since
f is a ﬁbration (see Lemma 6.54). With the mod C-connectivity hypothesis,
a spectral sequence argument given below shows that the bottom f∗is a C-
isomorphism. Inductively, the right-hand ρ is a C-isomorphism, so thereby
the left-hand ρ is a C-isomorphism. There are three diﬃculties with this
outline. We have to get the induction started, we have to make the mod C
spectral sequence argument, and we have to deal with the fact that if π2X ̸=
0, then ΩX is not simply-connected, so, strictly speaking, the inductive
hypothesis does not apply.
We will use the following lemma, which shows why Serre classes are
tailor-made to be used with spectral sequences.
Lemma 10.8. Let (Er
∗,∗, dr) be a ﬁrst quadrant spectral sequence spectral
sequence. Let C denote a class of abelian groups.
1. For any bigraded spectral sequence, if C satisﬁes Axiom 1, En
p,q ∈C
for some p, q implies that Er
p,q ∈C for all r ≥n.
2. Let F →E
f−→B be a ﬁbration over a simply connected base space.
If C satisﬁes Axioms 1 and 2A, if HpB ∈C for 0 < p < n, and if
HqF ∈C for 0 < q < n −1, then f∗: Hi(E, F) →Hi(B, b0) is a
C-isomorphism for i ≤n.
Proof. 1. A subgroup or a quotient group of a group in C is in C by Axiom
1. Thus a subquotient of a group in C is in C. Since Er
p,q is a subquotient of
En
p,q, the ﬁrst statement follows.

Consider the spectral sequence of the relative ﬁbration (Theorem
9.33)
F →(E, F) →(B, b0).
The E2-term is
E2
p,q ∼= Hp(B, b0; HqF) ∼= (Hp(B, b0) ⊗HqF) ⊕Tor(Hp−1(B, b0), HqF)
and the spectral sequence converges to H∗(E, F). Thus E2
p,q ∈C and hence

p,q ∈C when p = 0, 1 or when 1 < p < n and 0 < q < n−1 (see the shaded

The picture gives a convincing argument that

The spectral sequence gives a ﬁltration
0 = F−1,i+1 ⊂F0,i ⊂F1,i−1 ⊂· · · ⊂Fi−1,1 ⊂Fi,0 = Hi(E, F)
with
E∞
p,i−p = Fp,i−p/Fp−1,i−p+1.
It follows by induction on p, that Fp,i−p ∈C for p < i, and hence that
Hi(E, F) →E∞
i,0
is a C-isomorphism.

i,0 is a C-isomorphism. Since
the composite of C-isomorphisms is a C-isomorphism, it follows by induction
that

(10.3)
(10.2) and (10.3) is a C-isomorphism. But this composite is identiﬁed with
the edge homomorphism (see Theorem 9.12).
f∗: Hi(E, F) →Hi(B, b0).
We return to the proof of Part 1(a). The proof is by induction on n. For
n = 1, π1X = 0 = H1X. For n = 2, π1X = 0 = H1X, and so Lemma 10.8
shows that f∗: H2(PX, ΩX) →H2(X, x0) is an isomorphism (use the class
consisting only of the trivial group). Hence diagram (10.1), the fact the
π1(ΩX) is abelian since ΩX is an H-space, and Theorem 1.6 (the π1-version
of the Hurewicz theorem) show that ρ : π2X →H2X is an isomorphism for
any simply connected X.
Now suppose n > 2 and inductively assume for simply connected spaces
Y with πiY ∈C for i < n −1, that HiY ∈C for 0 < i < n −1 and that the
Hurewicz map ρ : πn−1Y →Hn−1Y is a C-isomorphism. Let X be a simply
connected space so that πiX ∈C for i < n. There will be two cases: where
π2X = 0 and where π2X ̸= 0.
In the ﬁrst case π1(ΩX) = π2X = 0, and πi(ΩX) = πi+1X, so we can
apply the inductive hypothesis to ΩX and conclude that the right-hand
ρ : πn−1(ΩX) →Hn−1(ΩX) in diagram (10.1) is a C-isomorphism and that
Hi(ΩX) ∈C for i < n −1. Then Lemma 10.8 applied to the path ﬁbration
ΩX →PX
f−→X
shows that the lower f∗in diagram (10.1) is a C-isomorphism. Then Lemma
10.4 applied repeatedly to diagram (10.1) shows that πnX →Hn−1X is a
C-isomorphism as desired.
Now suppose we are in the case where π2X ̸= 0. By hypothesis, π2X ∈C.
There is a map f : X →K(π2X, 2) inducing the identity on π2. Let X2 →X
be the homotopy ﬁber of this map. Now turn this map into a ﬁbration (see
Theorem 6.40) to obtain the ﬁbration
K(π2X, 1) →X2 →X.
Note by Axiom 3, Hi(K(π2X, 1)) ∈C for i > 0. This has two consequences,
ﬁrst that
Hi(X2) →Hi(X2, K(π2X, 1))

274
10. Further Applications of Spectral Sequences
is a C-isomorphism for i > 0, and second that Lemma 10.8 applies and so
Hi(X2, K(π2X, 1)) →Hi(X, x0)
is a C-isomorphism for 0 < i < n. Thus the composite of the last two maps
Hi(X2) →HiX is a C-isomorphism for 0 < i < n. Summarizing,
1. HiX2 ∈C for all 0 < i < n,
2. HnX2 ∼= HnX mod C,
3. πiX2 = πiX for all i > 2,
4. π1X2 = 0 = π2X2.
Thus ρ : πn(X2) →Hn(X2) is a C-isomorphism and Hi(X2) ∈C for
0 < i < n by the π2 = 0 case, hence the same is true for X. This completes
the proof of Part 1(a) of the mod C Hurewicz Theorem.
Part 1(b) follows formally from Part 1(a).
Indeed, let X be simply-
connected and suppose HiX ∈C for 0 < i < n. Then use induction on i to
show ρ : πiX →HiX is a C-isomorphism for 1 < i ≤n.
We now show how to deduce the relative Hurewicz theorem from the ab-
solute theorem. We assume that X and A are simply connected, nonempty,
and that π2(X, A) = 0. The diagram
π2A

commutes, with the vertical maps Hurewicz isomorphisms and the horizontal
maps induced by inclusion. Since the top horizontal map is surjective, so
is the bottom one, and it follows from the long exact sequence in homology
that H2(X, A) = 0.
Now suppose n > 2 and inductively assume that for any simply con-
nected pair B ⊂Y with π2(Y, B) = 0, and πi(Y, B) ∈C for i < n −1,
that Hi(Y, B) ∈C and that the Hurewicz map ρ : πi(Y, B) →Hi(Y, B) is
a C-isomorphism for i < n −1. Let (X, A) be a pair of simply connected
spaces with Hi(X, A) ∈C for i < n.
Now let n > 2 and assume that πk(X, A) ∈C for k < n.
Then by
induction Hk(X, A) ∈C for k < n. We must show that ρ : πn(X, A) →
Hn(X, A) is a C-isomorphism.
Let f : PX →X denote the path space ﬁbration, and let L = L(X, A) =
f−1(A). Thus we have a relative ﬁbration
ΩX →(PX, L) →(X, A).

Recall from page 155 in Chapter 6 that πk−1(L) ∼= πk(X, A) for all k. The
Leray–Serre spectral sequence for this ﬁbration has
E2
p,q = Hp(X, A; Hq(ΩX))
and converges to Hp+q(PX, L). The coeﬃcients are untwisted since X and
A are simply connected.
We have
Hp(X, A; Hq(ΩX)) = Hp(X, A)⊗Hq(ΩX) ⊕Tor(Hp−1(X, A), Hq(ΩX)) ∈C
for p < n. This follows from the fact that Hp(X, A) ∈C for p < n and
Axiom 2B. (Don’t let this point slip by you, this is where we needed the
axiom 2B which is stronger than 2A.)
Therefore (see the picture on page 272 again):
1. all diﬀerentials out of Er
n,0 have range in C, and so Hn(X, A) ∼= Er
n,0 ∼=
E∞
n,0 mod C for all r, and
2. E∞
p,n−p ∈C for p > 0, and so Hn(PX, L) ∼= E∞
n,0 mod C.
Arguing as above we have:
Hn(PX, L) ∼= E∞
n,0 mod C
∼= Hn(X, A) mod C.
(10.4)
This C-isomorphism is induced by the edge homomorphism and hence coin-
cides with the homomorphism induced by f : (PX, L) →(X, A).

commutes, with the two right horizontal arrows isomorphisms by the long
exact sequence of the pair in homology and homotopy groups and the fact
that PX is contractible.
The top left horizontal arrow is an isomorphism since f : PX →X is a
ﬁbration (see Lemma 6.54). Since πk−1(L) = πk(X, A) = 0, π1(L) = 0 and
πk(L) ∈C for all k < n −1. The absolute Hurewicz theorem implies that
ρ : πn−1(L) →Hn−1(L) is a C-isomorphism.
Finally the bottom left horizontal map is a C-isomorphism by (10.4).
Moving around the diagram shows that the Hurewicz map ρ : πn(X, A) →
Hn(X, A) is a C-isomorphism. This proves Part 2(a) of Theorem 10.5. As
before, Part 2(b) follows from Part 2(a).

10. Further Applications of Spectral Sequences
10.2. Homotopy groups of spheres
In this section we will use the machinery of spectral sequences and Serre
classes to obtain more non-trivial information about the elusive homotopy
groups of spheres. An immediate consequence of Corollary 10.7 is the fol-
lowing.
Corollary 10.9. The homotopy groups of spheres πkSn are ﬁnitely gener-
ated abelian groups.
Here is a result which follows easily from Serre mod C theory.
Theorem 10.10. If n is odd, πmSn is ﬁnite for m ̸= n.
Proof. If n = 1, then πmS1 = πmR = 0 for m ̸= 1. If n > 1 is odd, then a
map f : Sn →K(Z, n) inducing an isomorphism on πn, induces an isomor-
phism on homology with rational coeﬃcients by Proposition 9.25. Taking
the Serre class Cφ as in Exercise 160, we see f∗induces a Cφ-isomorphism
on homology, and hence, by the mod C Whitehead theorem, also a Cφ-
isomorphism on homotopy. Thus for all m, the kernel and cokernel of
f∗: πmSn →πm(K(Z, n))
are torsion groups. However the homotopy groups of spheres are ﬁnitely
generated. The result follows.
Corollary 10.11. The stable homotopy groups of spheres πS
n are ﬁnite for
n > 0.
Exercise 165. Prove that if n is even, then πkSn is ﬁnite except for k = n
and k = 2n −1, and that π2n−1Sn is the direct sum of Z and a ﬁnite
abelian group. (Hint: Let Sn−1 →T →Sn be the unit tangent bundle
of Sn for n even. Show that πnT →πnSn is not onto, by, for example,
showing that a lift of Id : Sn →Sn leads to a nonzero vector ﬁeld on Sn,
and hence a homotopy from the identity to the antipodal map. Conclude
that πnT →πnSn is the zero map. By looking at the transgression, deduce
that Hn(T) is ﬁnite except for H0T = H2n−1T = Z. Find a map inducing
an isomorphism Hk(T) ∼= Hk(S2n−1) mod Cφ. Then πk(T) ∼= πk(S2n−1)
mod Cφ via the Whitehead theorem. Then apply Theorem 10.10.)
For the next sequence of results, let K(Z, 2) →X →S3 be the ﬁbration
from (9.12).
Thus X is the homotopy ﬁber of the map S3 →K(Z, 3)
inducing an isomorphism on π3. It follows that πnX = 0 for n ≤3 and
πnX = πnS3 for n > 3.

if k is odd,

Proof. The integral cohomology ring of K(Z, 2) = CP ∞is a polynomial
ring H∗(K(Z, 2); Z) ∼= Z[c], where deg c = 2 (see Exercise 155).
Consider the cohomology spectral sequence for the ﬁbration (9.12). This
has
E2 = H∗(S3) ⊗Z[c].
More precisely,
Ep,q

Z · ck
if p = 0 and q = 2k is even, and
Z · ιck
if p = 3 and q = 2k is even,
where ι ∈H3(S3) denotes the generator, using Theorem 2.33 (the universal
coeﬃcient theorem for cohomology). Notice also that since all the diﬀeren-
tials d2 are zero, E2 = E3.
Since H2X = 0 = H3X, the diﬀerential d3 : E0,2
3
→E3,0
3
must be an
isomorphism, and so d3c = ι (after perhaps replacing ι by −ι). Thus
d(c2) = (dc) · c + c · dc = ι · c + c · ι = 2ι · c.
More generally, one shows by an easy induction argument that
d(cn) = nι · cn−1.
All other diﬀerentials in the spectral sequence are zero since either their
domain or range is zero. Therefore E3,2n−2
∞
= Z/n and hence H2n+1(X) =
Z/n if n ≥1. The universal coeﬃcient theorem now implies that H2n(X) =
Z/n for n ≥1.
Corollary 10.13. If p is a prime, the p-primary component of πiS3 is zero
if 3 < i < 2p, and is Z/p if i = 2p.
Proof. We use the class Cp. As before, let X be the space from the ﬁbration
(9.12). Lemma 10.12 implies that Hi(X) ∈Cp for 0 < i < 2p. Using the
mod C Hurewicz theorem we conclude that πi(X) ∈Cp for 0 < i < 2p, and
Z/p = H2p(X) ∼= π2p(X) mod Cp. This implies that the p-primary part of
π2p(X) is Z/p. The corollary now follows from the fact that πi(X) = πi(S3)
for i ̸= 3.

278
10. Further Applications of Spectral Sequences
With a bit more work one can show that the p-primary component of πS
n
is trivial for n < 2p−3 and equals Z/p for n = 2p−3 (see [36]). Take a look
at the table on page 208 to verify this in low dimensions. So for example, πS
2
has trivial p-primary part for p > 2 and πS
3 = Z/3 ⊕(2-primary subgroup).
We turn now to the computation of πS
2 .
In Theorem 9.28 we computed that π4S2 = Z/2. Consider the suspen-
sion map s : S2 →ΩS3, i.e. the adjoint of the identiﬁcation S(S2) = S3.
Let F be the homotopy ﬁber of s. The long exact sequence of homotopy
groups of the ﬁbration
F →S2
s−→ΩS3
(10.5)
shows that π1F = π2F = 0. Thus by the Hurewicz theorem π3F = H3F.
The spectral sequence for the ﬁbration (10.5) shows that the transgression
τ : H3F →H4(ΩS3) is an isomorphism. In Chapter 9 we computed that
Z ∼= H4(ΩS3) (see Equation (9.3)), and hence Z ∼= H3(F) = π3(F).
The long exact sequence in homotopy groups for (10.5) is
· · · →π4S2
s∗
−→π4(ΩS3) →π3F →π3S2 →π4S3 →0.
From the Hopf ﬁbration S1 →S3 →S2 we know that π3S2 = Z, and from
Theorem 9.26 we know π4S3 = Z/2. Since π3F = Z it follows from this
exact sequence that the suspension map s∗: π4S2 →π4(ΩS3) = π5S3 is
onto. Therefore, π5S3 is either 0 or Z/2. We will show that π5S3 = Z/2.
Consider once again our friend the space X of the ﬁbration (9.12). Since
π4X = π4S3 = Z/2, Let f : X →K(Z/2, 4) be a map inducing an iso-
morphism on π4 and let Y denote the homotopy ﬁber of f.
Since Y is
4-connected, H5(Y ; Z) = π5Y = π5X = π5S3. Since π5S3 is either 0 or Z/2,
the universal coeﬃcient theorem implies that π5S3 = H5(Y ; Z/2).
In the spectral sequence in Z/2-cohomology for the ﬁbration Y →X →
K(Z/2, 4), the diﬀerential
H5(F; Z/2) = E0,5
2
= E0,5
6
d6
−→E6,0
6
= E6,0
2
= H6(K(Z/2, 4); Z/2)
is surjective. This follows from the facts that Y is 4-connected, K(Z/2, 4)
is 3-connected, and Lemma 10.12 which implies that H6(X; Z/2) = 0 (you
should check this fact).
We will show in Section 10.5 below (Equation (10.12)) that
H6(K(Z/2, 4); Z/2) = Z/2.
Hence H5(F; Z/2) surjects to Z/2 and therefore equals Z/2. Thus we have
computed π5S3 = Z/2.
The homotopy exact sequence for the Hopf ﬁbration S3 →S7 →S4
shows that πS
2 = π6S4 ∼= π5S3. In particular this shows that the sequence

The long exact sequence of homotopy groups for the Hopf ﬁbration S1 →
S3 →S2 shows that π5S2 = π5S3, and so π5S2 = Z/2 also.
10.3. Suspension, looping, and the transgression
For any space X, identify the reduced cone CX as a quotient of [0, 1] × X
with the inclusion X ⊂CX corresponding to x →(1, x). Take the reduced
suspension SX to be CX/X, and let c : CX →SX denote the quotient map.
Unless otherwise speciﬁed, in this section Hk denotes (ordinary) homology
with some ﬁxed (untwisted) coeﬃcients.
Now consider the two fundamental maps
s : X →ΩSX, x →(t →(t, x))
and
ℓ: SΩX →X, (t, α) →α(t).
Then s : Y →ΩSY induces the suspension map
[X, Y ]0
s∗
−→[X, ΩSX]0 = [SX, SY ]0.
In particular, taking X = Sk yields the suspension homomorphism
s∗: πk(Y ) →πk+1(SY ).
The map ℓ: SΩX →X induces the “looping” map
[X, Y ]0
ℓ∗
−→[SΩX, Y ]0 = [ΩX, ΩY ]0
which takes a function to the induced function on loop spaces.
The purpose
of this section is to prove the Freudenthal suspension theorem (Theorem 8.7)
and to develop material for a dual result about stable cohomology operations
given in the next section.
We will relate these maps to the transgression for the path space ﬁ-
bration. For simplicity we assume throughout that X and Y are simply
connected.
We begin with the map s. Consider the path space ﬁbration over SY :
ΩSY →PSY
e−→SY

where e evaluates a path at its endpoint. The transgression in homology for
this ﬁbration is the “composite” (with domain a submodule of of Hk(SY )
and range a quotient module of Hk−1(ΩSY )):
τ : Hk(SY, ∗) ⊃Im(e∗)
e∗
←−Hk(PSY , ΩSY )
∂−→Hk−1(ΩSY )/∂(ker e∗).
Let S∗: Hk−1(Y ) →Hk(SY ) denote the suspension isomorphism, deﬁned
as the composite of isomorphisms
S∗: Hk−1(Y )
∂
←−Hk(CY, Y )
c∗
−→Hk(SY, ∗) ∼= Hk(SY ).
Theorem 10.14. The domain of τ is all of Hk(Y ). Moreover, the map
s∗: Hk−1(Y ) →Hk−1(ΩSY ) induced by s is a lift of τ ◦S∗.
In particular, if τ : Hk(SY ) →Hk−1(ΩSY ) is an isomorphism then so
is s∗: Hk−1(Y ) →Hk−1(ΩSY ).
Proof. Consider the map f : CY →PSY deﬁned by
f(t, y) = (r →(rt, y)).
Then e ◦f : CY →SY is just the map (t, y) →(t, y), i.e. the natural
collapse map c. Moreover, the restriction of f to Y = {1} × Y ⊂CY is the
map y →(r →(r, y)); this is just the map s. In other words, f induces a
map of pairs f : (CY, Y ) →(PSY, ΩSY ) whose restriction to the subspaces
is s. Thus f induces a map of the long exact sequences of the pairs; since
PSY and CY are contractible every third term vanishes and so we obtain
commuting diagrams with the horizontal arrows isomorphisms:

commutes, with c∗an isomorphism. It follows that e∗is onto, so that the
domain of τ is all of Hk(SY ). Moreover ∂◦f∗◦(c∗)−1 is a lift of τ, and so
using the deﬁnition of S∗and the commuting square above we compute:
τ ◦S∗= ∂◦f∗◦(c∗)−1 ◦S∗= ∂f∗∂−1 = s∗.

10.3. Suspension, looping, and the transgression
281
As an application of Theorem 10.14, we prove the Freudenthal suspen-
sion theorem (Theorem 8.7).
Suppose that Y is a (n −1)-connected space, with n > 1.
Using
the Hurewicz theorem and the suspension isomorphism S∗: Hk(Y ; Z) ∼=
Hk+1(SY ; Z) we see that SY is n-connected. Since πk(ΩSY ) = πk+1(SY ),
ΩSY is (n −1)-connected, and hence its homology vanishes in dimensions
less than n by the Hurewicz theorem.
The Serre exact sequence (Theorem 9.15) for the ﬁbration
ΩSY →PSY
e−→SY
is
H2n(ΩSY ; Z) →H2n(PSY ; Z)
e∗
−→H2n(SY ; Z)
τ−→H2n−1(ΩSY ; Z) →· · ·
and since the path space PSY is contractible it follows that the transgres-
sion τ : Hk(SY ; Z) →Hk−1(ΩSY ; Z) is an isomorphism for all k ≤2n.
Theorem 10.14 implies that s∗: Hk−1(Y ; Z) →Hk−1(ΩSY ; Z) is an isomor-
phism for all k ≤2n. Hence the relative homology groups Hk(ΩSY, Y ; Z)
vanish for k ≤2n−1. From the relative Hurewicz theorem we conclude that
πk(ΩSY, Y ) = 0 for k ≤2n −1 and so s∗: πk(Y ) →πk(ΩSY ) is an isomor-
phism for k < 2n −1 and an epimorphism for k = 2n −1. The composite
πk(Y )
s∗
−→πk(ΩSY ) = πk+1(SY ) is the suspension homomorphism and so
we have proven the Freudenthal suspension theorem.
We turn our attention to the map ℓ: SΩX →X. This induces a map
ℓ∗: Hk(SΩX) →Hk(X)
which we can precompose with the suspension isomorphism to obtain
ℓ∗◦S∗: Hk−1(ΩX) →Hk(X).
The transgression for the path space ﬁbration over X,
ΩX →PX
e−→X.
is the homomorphism
τ : Hk(X, ∗) ⊃Im(e∗)
e∗
←−Hk(PX, ΩX)
∂−→Hk−1(ΩX)/∂(ker e∗).
The following theorem is the analogue of Theorem 10.14 for the map ℓ.
Theorem 10.15. The homomorphism ℓ∗◦S∗is a left inverse for τ on its
domain, i.e. ℓ∗◦S∗◦τ(x) = x if x lies in the domain of τ. Hence τ is
injective.
In particular, if τ : Hk(X) →Hk−1(ΩX) is an isomorphism then τ and
ℓ∗◦S∗are inverses.

Proof. This time we use the map g : CΩX →PX deﬁned by
(t, α) →(s →α(st)).
Thus g(0, α) and g(t, const∗) are both the constant path at ∗, so that this
indeed well-deﬁnes a map on the reduced cone. Moreover, g(1, α) = α, and
so g deﬁnes a map of pairs g : (CΩX, ΩX) →(PX, ΩX) which restricts
to the identity map on ΩX. Since both CΩX and PX are contractible it
follows that the maps between the long exact sequences of these pairs reduce
to a commuting triangle of isomorphisms
Hk(CΩX, ΩX)
Hk(PX, ΩX)
Hk−1(ΩX).

One of course needs to be careful with domains and ranges in this calculation.
Theorems 10.14 and 10.15 have their cohomology analogues, whose state-
ments and proofs are given essentially by reversing all the arrows. We will
use the cohomology analogue of Theorem 10.15 in our discussion of stable co-
homology operations. Let S∗: Hk(SY ) →Hk−1(Y ) denote the suspension
isomorphism in cohomology.
Corollary 10.16. Suppose that the cohomology transgression
τ ∗: Hk−1(ΩX) →Hk(X)
for the path space ﬁbration ΩX →PX →X is an isomorphism.
Then the composite S∗◦ℓ∗is the inverse of τ ∗.

10.4. Cohomology operations
283
The following exercise gives a “dual” description of the isomorphism S∗.
Exercise 166. From the perspective of the Eilenberg–MacLane spectrum,
prove that S∗: Hk(SY ) →Hk−1(Y ) is the composite of the adjoint and the
map induced by the homotopy equivalence ΩK(A, k) ∼K(A, k −1):
Hk(SY ;A)∼=[SY,K(A, k)]0 ∼=[Y,ΩK(A, k)]0 ∼=[Y,K(A, k−1)]0 ∼=Hk−1(Y ;A).
10.4. Cohomology operations
We have seen that the cohomology of a space with coeﬃcients in a ring has
a natural ring structure. Cohomology operations are a further reﬁnement
of the structure of the cohomology of a space. We have already come across
cohomology operations in Chapter 7 (see Deﬁnition 7.25 and Exercise 120).
10.4.1. Deﬁnition and simple examples. We recall the deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 10.17. If A, C are abelian groups, a cohomology operation of
type (n, A; q, C) is a natural transformation of functors
θ : Hn(−; A) →Hq(−; C).
The set of all cohomology operations of type (n, A; q, C) is denoted by
O(n, A; q, C).
The following are some standard examples.
Coeﬃcient homomorphisms. If h : A →C is a homomorphism, then h
induces homomorphisms
h∗: Hn(X; A) →Hn(X; C)
for all n; these are natural, so h deﬁnes an operation h∗of type (n, A; n, C)
for any n.
Bockstein homomorphisms. If
0 →A →B →C →0
(10.6)
is a short exact sequence of abelian groups, then 0 →Hom(C∗X, A) →
Hom(C∗X, B) →Hom(C∗X, C) →0 is exact, where C∗X denotes the sin-
gular or cellular chain complex of X. Thus one obtains a long exact sequence
in cohomology.
· · · →Hk(X; A) →Hk(X; B) →Hk(X; C) →Hk+1(X; A) →· · ·
The connecting homomorphisms
βk : Hk(X; C) →Hk+1(X; A)
are called the Bockstein operators associated to the short exact sequence
(10.6). For each k this construction deﬁnes a cohomology operation βk of
type (k, C; k + 1, A).

284
10. Further Applications of Spectral Sequences
Squaring. If R is a ring, Let θn : Hn(X; R) →H2n(X; R) be the map
x →x ∪x.
Then θn is a natural transformation since f∗(x ∪x) = f∗(x) ∪f∗(x), and
hence a cohomology operation of type (n, R; 2n, R).
Remark. At this point we would like to avoid using the symbol “∪” for
the product in the cohomology ring of a space and will use juxtaposition to
indicate multiplication whenever it is convenient.
Notice that θn is not a homomorphism, since (x + y)2 ̸= x2 + y2 in
general. In fact the deﬁnition of a cohomology operation does not require it
to be a homomorphism.
Main example. Let A, C be abelian groups, and let
u ∈Hq(K(A, n); C).
For CW-complexes Theorem 7.22 says that
[X, K(A, n)] ∼= Hn(X; A), via
,
f : X →K(A, n)
-
→f∗(ι),
where ι ∈Hn(K(A, n); A) is the fundamental class of K(A, n) (see Deﬁnition
7.21).
Thus, u ∈Hq(K(A, n); C) deﬁnes a map (up to homotopy)
fu : K(A, n) →K(C, q)
and hence u deﬁnes a cohomology operation θu as the composite
Hn(X; A) = [X; K(A, n)]
(fu)∗
−−−→[X, K(C, q)] = Hq(X; C).
So u ∈Hq(K(A, n); C) deﬁnes the operation θu of type (n, A; q, C).
In Exercise 120 you showed that the correspondence u →θu gave a
bijection between Hq(K(A, n); C) and O(n, A; q, C); the inverse map is θ →
θ(ι).
10.4.2. Stable operations.
Deﬁnition 10.18. Given a cohomology operation θ ∈O(n, A; q, C), the
suspension of θ, σ∗(θ), is the operation of type (n −1, A; q −1, C) deﬁned
by requiring the following diagram to commute,
Hn−1(X; A)

Hn(SX; A)

where the vertical maps are the usual suspension isomorphisms,

10.4. Cohomology operations
285
(The name “suspension” is perhaps not the best choice for σ∗, since
as we will see below it is induced by the “looping” map ℓof Section 10.3
and so is more properly thought of as a desuspension. However this is its
traditional name and so we will stick to it. The reader should not confuse it
with the suspension isomorphism S∗: Hk(SX) →Hk−1(X) although they
are of course related.)
Thus to any cohomology operation θ we can associate the sequence
σ∗(θ), σ∗(σ∗(θ)), · · · . This motivates the following deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 10.19. A stable cohomology operation of degree r and type (A, C)
is a sequence of operations θ = {θn} where
θn ∈O(n, A; n + r, C) and σ∗(θn) = θn−1.
Thus a stable operation of degree r and type (A, C) is the same thing as an
element in the inverse limit of the sequence
· · · σ∗
−→Hn+r(K(A,n);C) σ∗
−→Hn+r−1(K(A,n−1);C) σ∗
−→· · · σ∗
−→Hr+1(K(A,1);C).
Denote by Ar(A; C) the set of all stable cohomology operations θ = {θn} of
degree r and type (A, C).
To decide whether a cohomology operation θ ∈O(n, A; q, C) forms a
component of a stable cohomology operation, at the very least we need to
know whether θ = σ∗(θ′) for some θ′. This is possible if θ is transgressive,
as we now explain.
The map
σ∗: O(n, A; q, C) →O(n −1, A; q −1, C)
is deﬁned for each (n, A; q, C). Using Exercise 120 we think of σ∗as a map
σ∗: Hq(K(A, n); C) →Hq−1(K(A, n −1); C)
or, equivalently, a map
σ∗: [K(A, n), K(C, q)]0 →[K(A,n −1), K(C,q −1)]0
∼
=
−→[ΩK(A, n), ΩK(C, q)]0.
(10.7)
Exercise 167. Show that in Equation (10.7), σ∗is given by “looping”, i.e.
σ∗= Ω: [K(A, n), K(C, q)]0 →[ΩK(A, n), ΩK(C, q)]0,
where (Ωf)(α)(t) = f(α(t)). Conclude that the composite of σ∗with the
isomorphism given by the adjoint
[ΩK(A, n), ΩK(C, q)]0 = [SΩK(A, n), K(C, q)]0
is ℓ∗, the map induced by ℓ: SΩK(A, n) →K(A, n) of Section 10.3.

10. Further Applications of Spectral Sequences
Since the suspension isomorphism S∗: Hq(SX; C) →Hq−1(X; C) is the
composite of the adjoint and the identiﬁcation ΩK(C, q) = K(C, q −1):
S∗: [SX, K(C, q)]0 = [X, ΩK(K, q)]0 = [X, K(C, q −1)]0,
it follows immediately from Exercise 167 that
σ∗= S∗◦ℓ∗.
(10.8)
Consider the cohomology transgression τ ∗for the path space ﬁbration
over K(A, n)
K(A, n −1) →P
e−→K(A, n).
(10.9)
Corollary 10.16 implies that the homomorphism σ∗is a left inverse of τ ∗.
This immediately implies the following.
Corollary 10.20. If the class θ ∈Hq(K(A, n); B) is transgressive (i.e. in
the domain of the transgression τ), then σ∗(τ ∗(θ)) = θ.
What this corollary says is that θ ∈O(n, A; q, C) is of the form σ∗(θ′)
if θ is transgressive for the ﬁbration (10.9), when viewed as an element in
Hq(K(A, n); C).
Theorem 10.21. If n ≥2, the transgression for the ﬁbration (10.9) induces
isomorphisms
τ : Hq−1(K(A, n −1); C) →Hq(K(A, n); C)
for 2n ≥q + 2.
Proof. Consider the Leray–Serre cohomology spectral sequence (with C
coeﬃcients) for the ﬁbration (10.9). Since Ep,q
2
= Hp(K(A, n); Hq(K(A, n−
1)), the Ep,q
2
terms vanish if 1 ≤p ≤n −1 or if 1 ≤q ≤n −2.
This implies that if 2n ≥q + 2,
Hq−1(K(A, n −1)) ∼= E0,q−1
2
= E0,q−1
q
and
Hq(K(A, n)) ∼= Eq,0
2
= Eq,0
q .
Since the total space is contractible, Ep,q
∞= 0 if p + q ̸= 0. Hence the
diﬀerential dq : E0,q−1
q
→Eq,0
q
is an isomorphism. Theorem 9.13 states that
this diﬀerential coincides with the transgression, and so we conclude that
the transgression τ : Hq−1(K(A, n −1)) →Hq(K(A, n)) is an isomorphism
for 2n ≥q + 2.

10.4. Cohomology operations
287
Since σ∗and τ ∗are inverses, if one starts with a cohomology operation
θ ∈Hq(K(A, n); C), then the sequence θ, σ∗(θ), σ∗(σ∗(θ)), · · · can be ex-
tended to the left to give a stable operation provided θ, τ ∗(θ), τ ∗(τ ∗(θ)) etc.
are transgressive.
A convenient way to organize this information is the following. If we
write
Ar(A; C) = lim
←−
n
Hn+r(K(A, n); C),
then Theorem 10.21 shows that the limit is attained at a ﬁnite stage:
Ar(A; C) = lim
←−
n
Hn+r(K(A, n); C) = H2r+1(K(A, r + 1); C).
(10.10)
and so a class θ ∈H2r+1(K(A, r + 1); C) deﬁnes the stable operation
· · · , τ ∗(τ ∗(θ)), τ ∗(θ), θ, σ∗(θ), σ∗(σ∗(θ)), · · ·
Exercise 168. Show that the composition of two stable cohomology oper-
ations is a stable cohomology operation.
The proof of the following proposition is easy and is left to the reader.
Proposition 10.22. If G is an abelian group then the sum and composition
give A(G) = ⊕
r Ar(G, G) the structure of a graded, associative ring with unit.
Exercise 169. Prove Proposition 10.22.
Exercise 170. Use Exercise 167 to show that if θ is a stable cohomol-
ogy operation, then θ(f + g) = θ(f) + θ(g). (Hint: if f, g ∈Hn(X; A) =
[X, K(A, n)]0 = [X, ΩK(A, n −1)]0, then the group structure is given by
taking composition of loops, which is preserved by σ∗.)
An interesting consequence of Proposition 10.22 and Exercise 170 is that
for any space X, the cohomology H∗(X; G) has the structure of a module
over A(G). This additional structure is functorial.
Deﬁnition 10.23. Take G = Z/p, p a prime. Then Ap = A(Z/p) is called
the mod p Steenrod algebra. It is a graded algebra over Z/p.
Thus the Z/p cohomology algebra of a space is a module over the mod
p Steenrod algebra.
Exercise 171. Given two spectra K and K′, deﬁne what a map of degree
r from K to K′ is, and what a homotopy of such maps is. Then show that
taking K(A) (resp. K(B)) to be the Eilenberg–MacLane spectrum for the
abelian group A (resp. B),
A∗(A, B) = [K(A), K(B)]∗.

10. Further Applications of Spectral Sequences
Can you deﬁne stable cohomology operations for arbitrary generalized
homology theories?
10.5. The mod 2 Steenrod algebra
The goal in this section is to explore the mod 2 Steenrod algebra. We will
take an ad-hoc, hands-on approach. A systematic exposition of this impor-
tant algebra can be found in many homotopy theory texts. The standard
reference is [31].
The complete structure of the mod 2 Steenrod algebra is described in
the following result, most of whose proof we will omit.
Theorem 10.24. Let T be the (bigraded) tensor algebra over Z/2 generated
by the symbols Sqi for i ≥0. (Thus, if V is the graded Z/2 vector space
spanned by a basis Sq0, Sq1, · · · , then T = T(V ) = Z/2⊕V ⊕(V ⊗V )⊕· · · )
Let I ⊂T be the two-sided homogeneous ideal generated by:
1. 1 + Sq0 and
2. (Adem relations)
Sqa ⊗Sqb +
[a/2]

c=0
,b −c −1
a −2c
-
Sqa+b−c ⊗Sqc
for all 0 < a < 2b.
Then A2 is isomorphic to T/I. The identiﬁcation takes the Sqi to stable
operations satisfying:
a. Sqi(x) = 0 if x ∈Hi−p(X), p > 0.
b. Sqi(x) = x2 if x ∈Hi(X).
c. Sq1 is the Bockstein associated to the short exact sequence
0 →Z/2 →Z/4 →Z/2 →0.
d. (Cartan formula)
Sqi(xy) =

j
Sqjx Sqi−jy.
In this theorem the Sqi should be interpreted as a stable operations
in the sense that Sqi = {Sqi
(n)} where Sqi
(n) : Hn(X) →Hn+i(X) and
σ∗(Sqi
(n)) = Sqi
(n−1).
Exercise 170 says that each component θn of a stable operation is a
group homomorphism. Thus the Sqi are additive, i.e. Sqi
(n) : Hn(X) →

10.5. The mod 2 Steenrod algebra
289
Hn+i(X) is a group homomorphism for all n. The operation Sqi is not a
ring homomorphism, this is clear from the Cartan formula. For example,
Sq1(ab) = Sq1a · b + a · Sq1b
so Sq1 is a derivation. However, if we deﬁne the total square by the formula
Sq =
∞

i=0
Sqi
(on each element x ∈Hp(X) the sum is ﬁnite; Sq(x) = x+Sq1x+· · ·+Sqpx
since Sqp+kx = 0 for k > 0) then the Cartan formula simpliﬁes to
Sq(xy) = Sq(x)Sq(y)
What this says is that the Sqi are the homogeneous components of a ring
endomorphism Sq of the cohomology algebra H∗(X; Z/2).
There are several ways of constructing the Sqi and verifying their proper-
ties. We will not prove Theorem 10.24 in general, but instead will construct
the operations Sqi and focus on some special cases, taking the point of view
that computing Ar
2 is the same, using Equation (10.10), as computing the
cohomology H2r+1(K(Z/2, r + 1); Z/2).
As a ﬁrst simple computation, notice that
A0
2 = H1(K(Z/2, 1); Z/2) = Z/2 = Hn(K(Z/2, n); Z/2).
The generator is
ιn ∈Hn(K(Z/2, n); Z/2) = Hom(Hn(K(Z/2, n)), Z/2),
i.e. the generator is the fundamental class, which corresponds to te identity
map via the identiﬁcation Hn(K(Z/2, n); Z/2) = [K(Z/2, n), K(Z/2, n)]0.
This implies that the corresponding cohomology operation is the identity
operation, which we denote by Sq0.
Next consider
A1
2 = H3(K(Z/2, 2), Z/2) ∼= Hn+1(K(Z/2, n), Z/2) for all n ≥2.
Recall that the isomorphism is given by the transgression in the spectral
sequence for the (path space) ﬁbration
K(Z/2, n −1) →∗→K(Z/2, n).
Proposition 10.25. The transgression
τ ∗: H2(K(Z/2, 1); Z/2) →H3(K(Z/2, 2), Z/2)
is an isomorphism.

290
10. Further Applications of Spectral Sequences
Notice that the statement falls just out of the range of Theorem 10.21.
Before we prove this proposition, we draw some conclusions. Recall that
inﬁnite-dimensional real projective space RP ∞has the homotopy type of a
K(Z/2, 1). Therefore the cohomology ring H∗(K(Z/2, 1)) is isomorphic to
the polynomial ring Z/2[ι1]. In particular,
H2(K(Z/2, 1); Z/2) = Z/2,
generated by ι2
1. Hence A1
2 ∼= Z/2. It is represented by an element which we
denote by Sq1.
Explicitly, deﬁne Sq1
(n) ∈Hn+1(K(Z/2, n); Z/2) by
Sq1
(n) =



τ ∗◦· · · ◦τ ∗
.
/0

n−1
(i2
1)
if n ≥1;
0
if n = 0.
(10.11)
From earlier remarks it follows that Sq1
(n) = σ∗(Sq1
(n+1)) if n ≥1. By
construction it is immediate that
Sq1
(1) : H1(X; Z/2) →H2(X; Z/2)
is the map x →x2. The following exercise shows that σ∗(Sq1
(1)) = 0 = Sq1
(0)
conﬁrming that Equation (10.11) gives the correct deﬁnition for Sq1
(0).
Exercise 172. Show that for any space X, the map
Hn(SX) →H2n(SX)
given by x →x2 is zero for n > 0.
(Hint: Consider the cup product
Hn(CX, X) × Hn(CX) →H2n(CX, X) of Corollary 3.24.)
Proof of Proposition 10.25. Consider the cohomology spectral sequence
for the path space ﬁbration
K(Z/2, 1) →∗→K(Z/2, 2).
The E2 level in low degrees is tabulated in the following diagram.

Since d2(i1) = i2 it follows that d2(i2
1) = d2(i1)i1 + i1d2i1 = i2i1 + i1i2 =
2i1i2 = 0. Thus i2
1 survives to E3, and hence is transgressive. Moreover d3 :
E0,2
3
→E3,0
3
must be an isomorphism, since Ep,q
∞= 0 for all (p, q) ̸= (0, 0).
Thus i2
1 transgresses to a generator τ(i2
1) of H3(K(Z/2, 2); Z/2).
We next turn our attention to
A2
2 ∼= H5(K(Z/2, 3); Z/2) ∼= Hn+2(K(Z/2, n), Z/2)
for n ≥3. The spectral sequence for the ﬁbration

10. Further Applications of Spectral Sequences
Three diﬀerentials are drawn.
The diﬀerential d3 : E0,2
3
→E3,0
3
is
an isomorphism since E0,2
3
= E0,2
2
= H2(K(Z/2, 2)) = Z/2⟨ι2⟩.
Also
E3,0
3
= H3(K(Z/2, 3)) = Z/2⟨ι3⟩and since Ep,q
∞= 0 for all (p, q) ̸= (0, 0) we
conclude that d3ι2 = ι3.
Now observe that since
E3,2
2
= H3(K(Z/2, 3)) ⊗H2(K(Z/2, 2)) = Z/2⟨ι2ι3⟩,
the diﬀerential d3 : E0,4
3
→E3,2
3
= E3,2
2
takes ι2
2 to 2ι2ι3 = 0.
Lemma 10.26. E0,4
3
is isomorphic to Z/2, spanned by ι2
2.
Assuming Lemma 10.26 for a moment, it follows that d5 : E0,4
5
→E5,0
5
is an isomorphism, so that ι2
2 is transgressive, and
E5,0
5
= E5,0
2
= H5(K(Z/2, 3), Z/2) = Z/2⟨τ(ι2
2)⟩.
Thus
Z/2 = A2
2 = Hk+2(K(Z/2, k); Z/2) for k ≥3,
(10.12)
spanned by τ(ι2
2). We denote τ(ι2
2) by Sq2. More precisely, denote τ(ι2
2)
by Sq2
(3). Then let Sq2 = {Sq2
(n)} where Sq2
(n) = τ (n−3)(Sq2
(3)) for n > 3,
Sq2
(2) = ι2
2, and Sq2
(1) = Sq2
(0) = 0.
Since Sq2
(2) = ι2
2, it follows that Sq2x = x2 if x ∈H2(X; Z/2). Exercise
172 shows that σ∗(Sq2
(2)) = 0 = Sq2
(1), so we have correctly deﬁned the stable
operation Sq2.
Proof of Lemma 10.26. First,
E0,4
3
= E0,4
2
= H0(K(Z/2, 3); H4(K(Z/2, 2)) = H4(K(Z/2, 2)).
Hence it must be shown that H4(K(Z/2, 2)) ∼= Z/2, generated by ι2
2.
Let f : K(Z, 2) →K(Z/2, 2) be a map representing the generator c of
H2(K(Z, 2); Z/2) = Z/2. Recall that K(Z, 2) ∼CP ∞, so that its cohomol-
ogy ring H∗(K(Z, 2); Z/2) is isomorphic to Z/2[c], the polynomial ring with
generator c. In particular, c2 ̸= 0. By deﬁnition of the map f, f∗(ι2) = c. So
f∗(ι2
2) = c2 ̸= 0. Hence ι2
2 is non-zero in H4(K(Z/2, 2); Z/2). To complete
the proof it therefore suﬃces to show that H4(K(Z/2, 2)) = Z/2.
Consider the spectral sequence for the path space ﬁbration
K(Z/2, 1) →∗→K(Z/2, 2).
The facts d2(ι2
1) = 0 and d3(ι2
1) ̸= 0 established in the proof of Proposition
10.25 imply that d2 : E2,1
2
= Z/2⟨ι2ι1⟩→E4,0
2
is an isomorphism. Thus
Z/2 = E4,0 = H4(K(Z/2, 2)) as desired.

10.5. The mod 2 Steenrod algebra
293
The construction of Sq1 and Sq2 suggests we deﬁne Sqn in the following
way. Let ιn ∈Hn(K(Z/2, n), Z/2) denote the fundamental class. Let
y0 = ι2
n ∈H2n(K(Z/2, n); Z/2).
In the spectral sequence for the ﬁbration
K(Z/2, n) →∗→K(Z/2, n + 1),
the diﬀerential dn+1 takes ιn to ιn+1. Thus dn+1(y0) = 2ιnin+1 = 0 and
hence y0 is transgressive.
Let
y1=d2n+1(y0)=τ ∗(y0)∈E2n+1,0
2n+1 =E2n+1,0
2
= H2n+1(K(Z/2, n + 1); Z/2).
Then σ∗(y1) = y0.
The transgressions are isomorphisms
τ ∗: H2n+k(K(Z/2, n + k); Z/2) →H2n+k+1(K(Z/2, n + k + 1); Z/2)
for k ≥1. Thus we deﬁne
yr = (τ ∗)r(y0) ∈H2n+r(K(Z/2, n + r); Z/2).
This deﬁnes a sequence {yr} with σ∗(yr) = yr−1 for r ≥1.
If we extend this sequence by deﬁning xr = 0 for r < 0, then we still have
σ∗(yr) = yr−1 by Exercise 172. Hence the sequence {yr} deﬁnes a stable
cohomology operation Sqn
(k) = yn−k in An
2. By construction, Sqnx = x2 if
x ∈Hn(X; Z/2).
This completes the construction of the Steenrod operations Sqn. This
approach does not reveal much about their structure beyond showing that
Sqn(x) = x2 if x ∈Hn(X; Z/2). Showing that the Sqn generate the Steen-
rod algebra A2, establishing the Adem relations, and proving the rest of
Theorem 10.24 is more involved and requires a more detailed analysis of
the cohomology of the Eilenberg–Maclane spaces. We will content ourselves
with proving part (c) of Theorem 10.24, identifying Sq1 with the Bockstein
operator.
Lemma 10.27. The stable operation Sq1 is the Bockstein associated to the
exact sequence
0 →Z/2 →Z/4 →Z/2 →0.
Proof. Consider the long exact sequence in cohomology of K = K(Z/2, k)
associated to the short exact sequence 0 →Z/2 →Z/4 →Z/2 →0. This is
the sequence
· · · →Hk−1(K; Z/2) →Hk(K; Z/2) →
Hk(K; Z/4) →Hk(K; Z/2)
β−→Hk+1(K; Z/2) →· · ·
By deﬁnition the map labeled β is the Bockstein.

294
10. Further Applications of Spectral Sequences
The Hurewicz and universal coeﬃcient theorems show that
Hk−1(K; Z/2) = 0.
Also,
Hk(K; Z/2) = Hom(Hk(K), Z/2) = Hom(Z/2, Z/2) = Z/2
and
Hk(K; Z/4) = Hom(Hk(K); Z/4) = Hom(Z/2, Z/4) = Z/2.
It follows that β is an injection.
Induction using the spectral sequences for the ﬁbrations
K(Z/2, n −1) →∗→K(Z/2, n)
and the fact that the cellular chain complex for K(Z/2, 1) = RP ∞is
· · · →Z
0−→Z

0−→Z →0
shows that
Hk+1(K; Z)
∼=
Hk(K(Z/2, k −1); Z)
· · ·
∼=
H2(K(Z/2, 1); Z)
=
0.
Thus
Hk+1(K; Z/2)
=
Hom(Hk+1(K, Z), Z/2)) ⊕Ext (HkK, Z/2)
=
0 ⊕Z/2,
so that β is an isomorphism.
By deﬁnition, the cohomology operation β corresponds to the element
β(ik) in Hk+1(K; Z/2) = Z/2, but Sq1 was constructed to be the generator
of Hk+1(K; Z/2). Thus β = Sq1.
Here is an interesting application of the Steenrod squares to the homo-
topy groups of spheres.
Consider the Hopf ﬁbration S3 →S7
h−→S4. Using
h as an attaching map for an 8-cell to S4, we obtain the quaternionic pro-
jective plane X = HP 2. This has Z/2-cohomology Z/2 in dimensions 0, 4
and 8. Poincar´e duality implies that the intersection form on fourth coho-
mology is non-degenerate. Therefore, (using Z/2-coeﬃcients) if x ∈H4(X),
x2 = Sq4(x) ∈H8(X) = Z/2 is non-zero.
If we use the suspension Sh : S8 →S5 to attach an 9-cell to S5, we obtain
the suspension SX (prove this). We will show that Sh is not nullhomotopic,
and hence the suspension homomorphism π7S4 →π8S5 = πS
3 (which is onto
by the Freudenthal suspension theorem) is non-zero.

10.6. The Thom isomorphism theorem
295
Let y ∈H5(SX) denote the non-zero element. Suppose to the contrary
that Sh is nullhomotopic. Then SX is homotopy equivalent to the wedge
S5 ∨S8. In particular the map Sq4 : H5(SX) →H8(SX) is trivial, since if
y is the non-zero element of H5(S5 ∨S8), then y is pulled back from H5(S5)
via the projection S5 ∨S8 →S5, but H8(S5) = 0 and so by naturality
Sq4(y) = 0.
But, since Sq4 is a stable operation, the diagram

commutes, and so Sq4(y) ̸= 0.
Thus Sh : S8 →S5 is non-nullhomotopic, and so πS
3 is non-zero.
A similar argument, using the Hopf ﬁbration S7 →S15 →S8 solves the
following exercise.
Exercise 173. Show that the suspension
π15S8 →π16S9 = πS
7
is non-trivial on the homotopy class of the Hopf map S15 →S8.
10.6. The Thom isomorphism theorem
The Thom isomorphism theorem is a generalization of the fact that sus-
pension induces an isomorphism Hn(B) ∼= Hk+n(SkB).
Roughly speak-
ing, the Thom isomorphism theorem says that the suspension isomorphism
continues to hold when one “twists” the suspension construction.
More
precisely, the k-fold suspension SkB can be considered as the quotient
(B × Dk)/(B × Sk−1). This is generalized by replacing the space B × Dk
by the disk bundle of some vector bundle over B and replacing B × Sk−1 by
the corresponding sphere bundle.
Recall that the Thom space M(E) of a vector bundle E →B with
metric is identiﬁed with D(E)/S(E), where S(E) denote the unit sphere
bundle and D(E) denote the unit disk bundle of E →B. The collapsing
map deﬁnes, via excision, an isomorphism (with any coeﬃcients)
Hm(E, E0) →Hm(M(E), p)
where E0 denotes the complement in E of the zero section. The inclusion of
a ﬁber Rk ∼= Eb ⊂E can be viewed as a vector bundle map from a bundle

over the point b ∈B to E, and so induces a restriction homomorphism (for
any choice of coeﬃcients C)

if m ̸= k.

We will be concerned only with the two fundamental cases of C = Z/2
and C = Z.
Exercise 174. Prove that a vector bundle Rk →E →B is orientable (i.e.
its structure group reduces from O(k) to SO(k); see Deﬁnition 4.10) if and
only if the the local coeﬃcient system
π1(B) →Aut(Hk(Rk, Rk −{0}; Z)) = Aut(Z) ∼= Z/2
(determined by Corollary 6.13) is trivial. Notice that by pulling back bun-
dles, it is enough to prove this for B = S1. Prove that a vector bundle
over S1 is orientable if and only if it is trivial. (Hint: use the clutching
construction and the fact that O(k) has exactly two path components.)
In preparation for the statement of the Thom isomorphism theorem,
notice that given a vector bundle Rk →E
p−→B, there is a cup product
(with any ring coeﬃcients)
Hp(B) × Hq(E, E0)
∪
−→Hp+q(E, E0)

obtained by pre-composing the cup product
Hp(E) × Hq(E, E0) →Hp+q(E, E0)
(see Corollary 3.24) with the isomorphism p∗: Hp(B) →Hp(E) induced by
the bundle projection.

(see Equation (10.13)) takes u to the unique non-zero element. This
class u has the property that the homomorphism
Φ : Hn(B; Z/2) →Hk+n(E, E0; Z/2),
x →x ∪u
(Using the cup product (10.14)) is an isomorphism for all n.

2. If the vector bundle E →B is orientable, then there exists a class
˜u ∈Hk(E, E0; Z) so that for each b ∈B the restriction to the ﬁber
over b,
Hk(E, E0; Z) →Hk(Eb, (E0)b; Z) ∼= Z
takes ˜u to a generator. The class ˜u is unique up to sign. It has the
property that the homomorphism
˜Φ : Hn(B; Z) →Hk+n(E, E0; Z),
x →x ∪˜u
is an isomorphism for all n. Moreover the coeﬃcient homomorphism
Hk(E, E0; Z) →Hk(E, E0; Z/2) takes u to ˜u.
The classes u and ˜u are natural with respect to pulling back vector bundles:
if f : B′ →B is a continuous map, and E′ = f∗(E) the pulled back bundle,
then (with the obvious notation) u′ = f∗(u) and ˜u′ = f∗(˜u).
Deﬁnition 10.29. The cohomology class u ∈Hk(E, E0, Z/2) (resp. ˜u ∈
Hk(E, E0, Z)) whose existence is assured by Theorem 10.28 is called the
Thom class for Rk →E →B. If we wish to emphasize the bundle E →B,
we will denote its Thom class by uE (resp. ˜uE).
Proof of Theorem 10.28. We prove the two cases (Z and Z/2) simulta-
neously. To simplify the notation we replace the pair (E, E0) by the pair
(D(E), S(E)) where D(E) denotes the unit disk bundle and S(E) the unit
sphere bundle of E for some riemannian metric. We lose no information
since the inclusions (D(E), S(E)) →(E, E0) and (Dk, Sk−1) →(Eb, (E0)b)
are deformation retracts.
Consider the spectral sequence for the relative ﬁbration
(Dk, Sk−1) →(D(E), S(E)) →B
with Z/2 or Z coeﬃcients.
Using the universal coeﬃcient theorem, (and, for the orientable case, the
fact that the coeﬃcients are untwisted)

Thus Hp(B) ∼= Hp+k(D(E), S(E)).
Let u (resp. ˜u) generate Hk(D(E), S(E)) ∼= H0(X), which is isomor-
phic to Z/2 (resp.
Z).
Clearly u is unique and ˜u is unique up to sign.
Then the multiplicative properties of the spectral sequence imply that the
isomorphism Hp(B) ∼= Hp+k(D(E), S(E)) is given by γ →γ ∪u (resp.
γ ∪˜u).
Naturality of the classes u and ˜u follow from the naturality properties
of the spectral sequences with respect to cellular maps and the cellular
approximation theorem.
The fact that u (resp.
˜u) restricts to the generator in each ﬁber fol-
lows from naturality by considering the inclusion of the ﬁbrations induced
by the inclusion of a point b in B. The fact that ˜u is mapped to u via
Hk(D(E), S(E); Z) →Hk(D(E), S(E); Z/2) follows from uniqueness of the
Thom class and commutativity of the diagram

The Thom isomorphism theorem has a homology counterpart. We will
use the following corollary below.
Corollary 10.30. Taking the cap product with u ∈Hk(E, E0; Z/2) induces
isomorphisms
u ∩: Hn+k(E, E0; Z/2) →Hn(B; Z/2).
Proof. (Use Z/2-coeﬃcients throughout the proof.)
For any space X,
Hn(X) is isomorphic to Hom(Hn(X), Z/2) via x →⟨−, x⟩, where ⟨, ⟩
denotes the Kronecker pairing.
The composite isomorphism
Hn+k(E, E0)∼=Hom(Hn+k(E,E0), Z/2)

is given by x →z, where x and z are related by
⟨β, z⟩= ⟨β ∪u, x⟩for all β ∈Hn(B).
Since ⟨β ∪u, x⟩= β ∩(u ∩x), we conclude that z = u ∩x.

10.7. Intersection theory
One very useful consequence of the Thom isomorphism theorem is the iden-
tiﬁcation of intersection numbers with cup products in manifolds. For sim-
plicity we will only discuss the case of smooth compact manifolds, but ev-
erything we say holds in greater generality (with trickier proofs). In this
section all homology and cohomology is taken with Z coeﬃcients.
Resolving the various notions of orientability is necessary, and so our
exposition will involve a sequence of exercises to relate the various notions.
These exercises are all straightforward but they can be a bit confusing. A
mastery of orientation issues is quite useful for a working mathematician,
and you should keep in mind that such a mastery comes only from a thorough
understanding of the equivalence between diﬀerent points of view. (In other
words: solve these exercises!)
Recall that an orientation of a real ﬁnite-dimensional vector space V is
an equivalence class of bases of V where two bases are considered equivalent
if the determinant of the change of basis matrix is positive. Notice that a
choice of basis identiﬁes V with Rm for some m. This in turn induces an
isomorphism
Hm(V, V −{0})
∼
=
−→Hm(Rm, Rm −{0}) ∼= Z.
(10.15)
Exercise 175. Show that changing the orientation of V changes the iden-
tiﬁcation of Equation (10.15) by a sign.
It follows from this exercise that an orientation of V can be deﬁned as a
choice of generator of Hm(V, V −{0}). By choosing the dual generator an
orientation of V can also be deﬁned as a choice of orientation of Hm(V, V −
{0}).
We have come across several notions of orientability for smooth mani-
folds. One notion is that a smooth manifold M is orientable if its tangent
bundle is orientable; i.e. the structure group of TM can be reduced from
O(m) to SO(m). An orientation is a choice of such a reduction.
Exercise 176. Show that an orientation in this sense determines an equiv-
alence class of bases at each tangent space TpM. (Hint: use Exercise 174.)
More generally show that a reduction of the structure group of a vector
bundle E from O(n) to SO(n) determines an equivalence class of bases in
each ﬁber Ex so that these equivalence classes are compatible with the lo-
cal trivializations of E; i.e. the homeomorphism E|U ∼= U × Rn takes the
orientation of Ex to the same orientation fo Rn for all x ∈U.
Another notion of orientability says that a compact, connected manifold
M is orientable if Hm(M, ∂M) ∼= Z and that an orientation is a choice

300
10. Further Applications of Spectral Sequences
[M, ∂M] ∈Hm(M, ∂M) of generator, called the fundamental class of the
oriented manifold M. In the course of the proof of the Poincar´e duality
theorem one shows that if [M, ∂M] is the fundamental class of M, then for
each p ∈M the inclusion Hm(M, ∂M) →Hm(M, M −p) is an isomorphism.
Given p ∈M (and a choice of riemannian metric on M) the exponential
map exp : TpM →M restricts to a diﬀeomorphism in a small ball W ⊂TpM,
exp: W →U ⊂M and hence gives isomorphisms (the ﬁrst and third are
excision isomorphisms)
Hm(TpM, TpM −0) ∼= Hm(W, W −0)
exp
−−→Hm(U, U −p) ∼= Hm(M, M −p).
This shows that the choice of fundamental class [M, ∂M] ∈Hm(M, ∂M)
orients the tangent space TpM.
Exercise 177. Prove that this sets up an identiﬁcation between the two
notions of an orientation of a smooth manifold (the choice of [M, ∂M] and
an orientation of the vector bundle TM.)
The fundamental class [M, ∂M] ∈Hm(M, ∂M) of an oriented manifold
determines the dual cohomology fundamental class [M, ∂M]∗∈Hm(M, ∂M)
(and conversely) by the equation
⟨[M, ∂M]∗, [M, ∂M]⟩= 1
where ⟨, ⟩denotes the Kronecker pairing.
Suppose that V and W are oriented subspaces of an oriented vector
space Z, and that dim (V ) + dim (W) = dim (Z). Suppose that V and W
are transverse, i.e. V ∩W = 0. Then the intersection number of V and W is
the number in {±1} deﬁned to be the sign of the determinant of the change
of basis matrix from the (ordered) basis {bV , bW } to bZ, where bV , bW ,
and bZ denote bases in the given equivalence classes. Notice that reversing
the order of V and W changes the intersection number by (−1)dim(V )dim(W).
Now suppose that A and B are smooth, compact, connected, oriented
submanifolds of dimensions a and b of a compact oriented manifold M of
dimension m. (A smooth manifold is oriented if its tangent bundle is ori-
ented.) Assume that A is properly embedded, i.e. the boundary of A is
embedded in the boundary of M. Assume also that the boundary of B is
empty and that B is contained in the interior of M. Finally assume that A
and B are transverse. This means that at each point p ∈A∩B, the tangent
subspaces TpA and TpB span TpM.
Deﬁnition 10.31. Suppose that a + b = m.
Then since A and B are
transverse and compact, their intersection consists of a ﬁnite number of
points. Because A, B, and M are oriented, we can assign an intersection
number ϵp to each intersection point p ∈A ∩B by taking the intersection

number (as above) of the oriented subspaces TpA and TpB in TpM. Then
deﬁne the intersection number of A and B to be the integer
A · B =

p∈A∩B
ϵp.
Notice that A · B = (−1)abB · A.
Since A and B are oriented, they have fundamental classes [A, ∂A] ∈
Ha(A, ∂A), [B] ∈Hb(B). Let eA : A ⊂M and eB : B ⊂M denote the
inclusions. Then eA([A, ∂A]) ∈Ha(M, ∂M) and eB([B]) ∈Hb(M).
Theorem 10.32. Let α ∈Hb(M) be the Poincar´e dual to eA([A, ∂A]), and
β ∈Ha(M, ∂M) the Poincar´e dual to eB([B]), i.e.
α ∩[M, ∂M] = eA([A, ∂A]) and β ∩[M, ∂M] = eB([B]).
Then
A · B = ⟨α ∪β, [M, ∂M]⟩
(10.16)
where ⟨, ⟩denotes the Kronecker pairing.
Theorem 10.32 justiﬁes the terminology “intersection pairing” for the
cup product
Hb(M) × Ha(M, ∂M)
∪
−→Hm(M, ∂M)
∼
=
−→Z
(see Section 3.6.2). Moreover, it implies that the intersection number A · B
depends only on the homology classes eA([A, ∂A]) and eB([B]). In partic-
ular, given any not necessarily transverse submanifolds A and B as above,
the transversality theorems imply that B can be isotoped to be transverse to
A. This preserves the class eB([B]) and so the resulting intersection number
A · B is independent of the choice of the isotopy.
With more work one can deﬁne x·y for any classes x ∈Ha(M, ∂M) and
y ∈Hb(M), or even on the chain level for a simplicial complex and its dual
cell complex (by thinking of a simplex as a submanifold). Theorem 10.32 is
true in this greater generality. Alternatively, this approach can be reversed
to give a proof of Poincar´e duality and a deﬁnition of cup products in terms
of intersections.
There is also a mod 2 version of Theorem 10.32 in which orientation
issues do not play a role; one deﬁnes A ·2 B to be the number of intersection
points of A and B when A and B are transverse. It holds in greater gener-
ality since none of the manifolds need to be orientable, but the conclusion
is correspondingly weaker; it only holds mod 2. To help you digest the fol-
lowing argument you might ﬁrst consider the mod 2 case, thereby avoiding
sign and orientation issues which complicate the proof.

302
10. Further Applications of Spectral Sequences
Proof of Theorem 10.32. Let E denote the normal bundle of B ⊂M.
The tubular neighborhood theorem implies that E can be embedded as a
neighborhood of B in M, with B itself corresponding to the zero section.
Give E a metric.
It is a straightforward consequence of the fact that A and B are trans-
verse that for ε > 0 small enough, the disk bundle D(E) of vectors of E of
length less than or equal to ε intersects A in a ﬁnite number of disks Dp, one
for each p in A∩B, with each Dp isotopic rel boundary in (D(E), ∂D(E)) to
a ﬁber of the disk bundle D(E) →B. Using the isotopy extension theorem
(and maybe making ε smaller if necessary), we may assume A intersects
D(E) exactly in a union of ﬁbers, one for each point p ∈A ∩B. In other
words, after an isotopy supported in E which ﬁxes each p ∈A ∩B,
A ∩D(E) =
 
p∈A∩B
D(E)p.
For convenience we simplify notation by setting D = D(E). Thus the
boundary ∂D is the ε-sphere bundle of E. The subanifold A intersects D in
a union of disks Dp, one for each p ∈A ∩B. The situation is illustrated in
the following ﬁgure.
A
B
Dp
The manifold D is oriented as a submanifold of M. To see this, notice
that there are excision isomorphisms
Hm(D, ∂D) ∼= Hm(D, D −x) ∼= Hm(M, M −x) ∼= Hm(M, ∂M)
(10.17)
for any x ∈Int(D). Moving from left to right orients D compatibly with
M. Alternatively, TD = TM|D so the orientation of the tangent bundle of
M orients the tangent bundle of D.

10.7. Intersection theory
303
The normal bundle E →B is orientable. One way to see this is to use
the Whitney sum decomposition
E ⊕TB ∼= TM|B
(since E = ν(B ⊂M) ). The fact that TB and TM are orientable implies
that E is orientable. Orient E so that the intersection number of a ﬁber Ex
of E with the zero section B equals 1:
Ex · B = 1.
Exercise 178. Show that this condition uniquely speciﬁes an orientation
of the normal bundle E.
This orients the ﬁbers Dx, i.e.
for each x ∈B one gets a preferred
generator [Dx, ∂Dx] of Ha(Dx, ∂Dx).
The Thom isomorphism theorem says that there is a unique Thom class
˜u ∈Ha(D, ∂D) so that ∪˜u : Hk(B) →Hk+a(D, ∂D) is an isomorphism for
all k so that the restriction of ˜u to the ﬁber Dx satisﬁes ˜u|Dx = [Dx, ∂Dx]∗,
i.e. ⟨˜u, [Dx, ∂Dx]⟩= 1.
Now [B]∗∪˜u generates Hm(D, ∂D) and so equals [D, ∂D]∗up to sign.
The sign is equal to (−1)ab. To see this one can use naturality of the Thom
class and work over a small open set in B diﬀeomorphic to a ball of dimension
a.
Exercise 179. Prove that ˜u∪[B]∗= [D, ∂D]∗(and hence, by Theorem 3.13
[B]∗∪˜u = (−1)ab[D, ∂D]∗) by pulling E →B back over a small neighborhood
U ⊂B.
Thus, using Exercise 37 and Proposition 3.21,
(−1)ab = ⟨[B]∗∪˜u, [D, ∂D]⟩
= ([B]∗∪˜u) ∩[D, ∂D]
= [B]∗∩(˜u ∩[D, ∂D])
= ⟨[B]∗, ˜u ∩[D, ∂D]⟩
and so, since Hb(D) ∼= Z and Hb(D) ∼= Z,
˜u ∩[D, ∂D] = (−1)ab[B].
In other words, (−1)ab˜u is the Poincar´e dual to [B] in D.
The inclusion i1 : (D, ∂D) ⊂(M, M−Int(D)) induces excision isomor-
phisms in homology and cohomology. Hence Hn(M, M−Int(D)) is isomor-
phic to Z. The inclusion i2 : (M, ∂M) ⊂(M, M−Int(D)) is not an excision,
but induces an isomorphism
Hn(M, ∂M) →Hn(M, M −Int(D))

304
10. Further Applications of Spectral Sequences
since both groups are isomorphic to Z and the inclusions of both pairs to
(M, M −x) are excisions. Because the orientations were chosen compatibly,
i1([D, ∂D]) = [M, M −Int(D)] = i2([M, ∂M]).
It follows from naturality of the cap product
Hp(X, Y ) × Hq(X, Y )

The diagram above shows that if x ∈Hp(D, ∂D), i1(x ∩[D, ∂D]) = j∗(x) ∩
[M, ∂M]. Taking x = ˜u and using the notation [B] for the image of the
fundamental class of B in either D or M we conclude that
j∗(˜u) ∩[M, ∂M] = i1(˜u ∩[D, ∂D]) = (−1)ab[B].
In particular
β = (−1)abj∗(˜u).
We can think of the homomorphism j∗as being induced by the quotient
map j : M/∂M →D/∂D. Thus we have a corresponding homomorphism
j∗: Hp(M, ∂M) →H∗(D, ∂D). Using the notation [A, ∂A] for the funda-
mental class of A in Ha(M, ∂M), the class j∗([A, ∂A]) is represented by the
union of ﬁbers Dp, one for each p ∈A ∩B, but oriented according to the
local intersection number of A and B at p. Precisely:
j∗([A, ∂A]) =

where εp = 1 or −1 according to whether or not the two orientations of

During the proof of Theorem 10.32 we also proved the following.
Corollary 10.33. Let e : B ⊂M be an embedding of a smooth, closed,
oriented manifold in a compact, oriented manifold. Let D denote a closed
tubular neighborhood of B in M, with Thom class ˜u ∈Hn−b(D, ∂D), and let
j : M/∂M →D/∂D denote the collapse map. Then j∗(˜u) is the Poincar´e
dual to e∗([B]) (up to sign).
The sign ambiguity in Corollary 10.33 comes from the fact that there
are two possible choices of Thom classes ˜u; during the proof of Corollary
10.33 we made a speciﬁc choice by requiring that ⟨˜u, [Dx, ∂Dx]⟩= Dx · B.
We describe the usual way that a geometric topologist thinks of the
Poincar´e dual β ∈Ha(M, ∂M) to a cycle represented by a submanifold B ⊂
M. Given a cycle x ∈Ha(M, ∂M) represented by an oriented submanifold
(A, ∂A) ⊂(M, ∂M), the class β is represented by the cochain whose value
on x is given by the formula
⟨β, x⟩= B · A.
In brief, “the Poincar´e dual β to B is given by intersecting with B.”

Exercise 183. Think about how to modify the proof of Theorem 10.32 to
handle the situation when A and B are only immersed, instead of embedded.
A more ambitious exercise is the following, which says that the inter-

dimensions are not complementary.
Exercise 184. Show that if A and B are embedded, transverse, but a +
b > m, then the intersection A ∩B is an oriented, closed submanifold of

α ∪β. Use the fact that A ∩D is the pull-back of the disk bundle D →B
over A ∩B, use naturality of the Thom class, and apply Corollary 10.33.

Proof. Notice that M(E ⊕ε) = SM(E). Restricting to a ﬁber corresponds

n < k −1.
Proof. Consider the ﬁbration
O(k −1) →O(k) →Sk−1
taking a matrix in O(k) to its last column. This deloops twice (see Theorem

Sk−1 →BO(k −1) →BO(k).
The spectral sequence for this ﬁbration (or the Gysin sequence) shows that
the sequence

Notice that if n > k, then
Sqn(uk) = 0, and so wn = 0 in Hn(BO(k); Z/2) for n > k.

10.8. Stiefel–Whitney classes
309
Deﬁnition 10.38. The nth Stiefel–Whitney class of an Rk-vector bundle
E →B is the class
wn(E) = f∗
E(wn) ∈Hn(B; Z/2)
where fE : B →BO(k) denotes the classifying map for E (see Theorem
8.22).
It follows immediately from their deﬁnition that the Stiefel–Whitney
classes are natural with respect to pulling back bundles. In particular, if
E and E′ are isomorphic bundles over B, then wn(E) = wn(E′) for all n.
Moreover, since the wn are compatible with respect to the maps BO(k) →
BO(k + 1),
wn(E ⊕ϵ) = wn(E).
In other words, the Stiefel–Whitney classes are invariants of the stable equiv-
alence class of a vector bundle.
Exercise 185. Show that a vector bundle E is orientable if and only if
w1(E) = 0. (Hint: ﬁrst relate Sq1 to the Bockstein associated to the exact
sequence 0 →Z
×2
−→Z →Z/2 →0.)
The Cartan formula (see Theorem 10.24) easily implies the following
theorem.
Theorem 10.39. The Stiefel–Whitney numbers of a Whitey sum of vector
bundles satisfy
wk(E ⊕F) =

n
wn(E) ∪wk−n(F).
Exercise 186. Suppose that E and F are vector bundles over a ﬁnite-
dimensional CW-complex so that E ⊕F is trivial (i.e. E and F are stable
inverses. For example, take E to be the tangent bundle of a smooth compact
manifold and F its normal bundle for some embedding in Sn.) Use Theorem
10.39 to prove that
w1(F) = w1(E), w2(F) = w1(E)2 + w2(E), w3(F) = w1(E)3 + w3(E),
and, in general, that
wn(F) =

(i1 + · · · + ik)!
i1! · · · ik!
w1(E)i1 · · · wk(E)ik.
The Stiefel–Whitney classes generate the cohomology ring of BO(k), as
the following theorem shows.

10. Further Applications of Spectral Sequences
Theorem 10.40. The Z/2-cohomology ring of BO(k) is a polynomial ring
on the Stiefel–Whitney classes of degree less that or equal to k:
H∗(BO(k); Z/2) = Z/2[w1, w2, · · · , wk]
where wi ∈Hi(BO(k); Z/2) denotes the ith Stiefel–Whitney class.
Proof. (Use Z/2 coeﬃcients.) First we show that that wk ∈Hk(BO(n))
is non-zero if k ≤n. To see this it suﬃces by naturality to ﬁnd one Rn-
bundle with wk non-zero. let R1 →E →S1 denote the “M¨obius band”
bundle over S1, i.e. the bundle with clutching function S0 →O(1) the non-
constant map. This bundle has w1 ̸= 0 (for example, it is not orientable).
Thus w1 is non-zero in H1(BO(1)) and, since the restrictions
Hk(BO(n)) →Hk(BO(n −1))
preserve the wi by Proposition 10.37, w1 is non-zero in H1(BO(n)) for all
n ≥1.
Since BO(1) = K(Z/2, 1) = RP ∞and w1 ̸= 0, H∗(BO(1)) = Z/2[w1].
Let E →BO(1) be a bundle with w1(F) = w1. Then Theorem 10.39 (and
induction) shows that
wk(F ⊕· · · ⊕F
.
/0
1
k times
) = w1(F)k,
which is non-zero in Hk(BO(1)). Therefore wk ∈Hk(BO(n)) is non-zero
for all n ≥k.
We prove the theorem by induction. The case n = 1 is contained in
the previous paragraph. Let i : BO(n −1) →BO(n) denote the inclusion.
The induced map i∗: H∗(BO(n)) →H∗(BO(n −1)) is surjective since by
induction H∗(BO(n −1) is generated by the wi for i ≤n −1, and these are
in the image of i∗.
The ﬁber of i : BO(n −1) →BO(n) is Sn−1; in fact the ﬁbration
obtained by taking an orthogonal matrix to its last column
O(n −1) →O(n) →Sn−1
deloops twice to give the ﬁbration
Sn−1 →BO(n −1) →BO(n).
Consider the cohomology spectral sequence for this ﬁbration.
It has
Ep,q
2
= Hp(BO(n)) ⊗Hq(Sn−1) which is zero if q ̸= 0 or n −1. Hence

Ep,q

if k > n.

10.8. Stiefel–Whitney classes
311
This leads to the exact sequence (this is just the Gysin sequence in coho-
mology)
· · · →Hk−1(BO(n)) →Hk−1(BO(n −1)) →
Hn−1(Sn−1) ⊗Hk−1(BO(n))
dn
−→Hk(BO(n)) →Hk(BO(n −1)) →· · ·
which reduces to short exact sequences
0 →Hn−1(Sn−1) ⊗Hk−1(BO(n))
dn
−→Hk(BO(n)) →Hk(BO(n −1)) →0
(10.18)
since H∗(BO(n)) →H∗(BO(n−1)) is onto. The map labelled dn in (10.18)
is the diﬀerential dn Eq,n−1
n
→Eq+n,0
n
.
Taking k = n in the sequence (10.18) we obtain
0 →Hn−1(Sn−1)
dn
−→Hn(BO(n)) →Hn(BO(n −1)) →0.
Since Hn−1(Sn−1) = Z/2, generated by the fundamental class [Sn−1]∗, and
since wn ∈Hn(BO(n)) is non-zero and in the kernel of the restriction
Hn(BO(n)) →Hn(BO(n −1)), it follows that dn([Sn−1]∗) = wn.
Applying the sequence (10.18), the fact that dn([Sn−1]∗∪α) = wn∪α for
α ∈Hk−1(BO(n)), and induction competes the proof, since this sequence
shows that any element in Hk(BO(n)) can we written uniquely as a sum of
classes of the form
wi1
1 · · · win−1
n−1 with i1 + 2i2 + · · · + (n −1)in−1 = k
and classes of the form
dn([Sn−1]∗)α = wnα
for some α ∈Hk−n(BO(n)).
Exercise 187. Show that if E →B is an Rk-vector bundle, then wk(E) is
the image of the Thom class under the composite
Hk(E, E0; Z/2)
i∗

z∗
−→Hk(B; Z/2)
where z : B →E denotes the zero section.
If E →B is an oriented Rk-vector bundle, the class
e(E) = z∗(i∗(˜u))) ∈Hk(B; Z)
is called the Euler class of E and reduces to wk(E) mod 2. Compare this
with the deﬁnition we gave of Euler class in Section 7.11.

10. Further Applications of Spectral Sequences
10.9. Localization
Given a subset P of the set of prime numbers, let Z(P) denote the integers
localized at P. This is the subring of the rationals consisting of all fractions
whose denominator is relatively prime to each prime in P;
Z(P) = { r
s | (r, s) = 1 and (s, p) = 1 for each prime p ∈P}.
Thus
Z ⊂Z(P) ⊂Q.
If P consists of a single prime p we write Z(P) = Z(p).
Deﬁnition 10.41. Given a set P of prime numbers, an abelian group A is
called P-local if the homomorphism
A →A ⊗Z Z(P),
a →a ⊗1
is an isomorphism.
If p is a prime and r > 0,
Z/pr ⊗Z(P) =

Z/pr
if p ∈P,
0
if p ̸∈P.
(10.19)
More generally, if A ∈CP , then A ⊗Z(P) = 0. This is because if a ∈A,
choose r > 0 relatively prime to each p ∈P so that ra = 0. Then r is
invertible in Z(P) and so for each z ∈Z(P),
a ⊗z = a ⊗zr
r = ra ⊗z
r = 0.
Since Z(P) is torsion free, it is ﬂat as an abelian group (see Exercise 27),
i.e. the functor −⊗Z Z(P) is exact. In particular, if f : A →B is a CP
isomorphism, then tensoring the exact sequence
0 →ker f →A
f−→B →coker f →0
with Z(P) and using the fact that
ker f ⊗Z(P) = 0 = coker f ⊗Z(P)
we conclude that
f ⊗1 : A ⊗Z(P) →B ⊗Z(P)
is an isomorphism. This implies that if A and B are CP -isomorphic then
A ⊗Z(P) is isomorphic to B ⊗Z(P). Conversely, suppose that A and B
are ﬁnitely generated abelian groups so that A ⊗Z(P) is isomorphic to B ⊗
Z(P). Then A and B have the same rank and their p-primary subgroups are
isomorphic for p ∈P. Thus there is a CP -isomorphism from A to B.
The (relative) Hurewicz theorem mod C implies the following result,
when applied to CP .

10.9. Localization
313
Theorem 10.42. Let A, X be spaces such that Hi(A) and Hi(X) are ﬁnitely
generated for each i, such that π1(A) = π1(X) = 0.
Let f : A →X be a map with π2(X, A) = 0. Then the statements:
1. f∗: Hi(A; Z(P)) →Hi(X; Z(P)) is an isomorphism for i < n and an
epimorphism for i = n,
2. Hi(X, A; Z(P)) = 0 for i ≤n,
3. Hi(X, A; Z) ∈CP for i ≤n,
4. πi(X, A) ∈CP for i ≤n,
5. πi(A) →πi(X) is a CP -isomorphism for i < n and a CP -epimorphism
for i = n,
6. πi(A) ⊗Z(P) →πi(X) ⊗Z(P) is an isomorphism for i < n and an
epimorphism for i = n,
are equivalent, and imply that if i < n, then πi(A) and πi(X) have equal
rank and isomorphic p-primary components for each p ∈P.
Proof. Since Z(P) is ﬂat, the universal coeﬃcient theorem (Corollary 2.35)
implies that Hk(Y ; Z(P)) = Hk(Y ; Z)⊗Z(P) for any space Y and any k. Since
X and A have ﬁnitely generated Z-homology it follows from the discussion
preceding this theorem that the second and third assertions are equivalent.
The long exact sequence in homology and homotopy for a pair and the
relative Hurewicz theorem mod CP imply that 1. through 7. are equivalent.
The Hurewicz theorem mod CFG implies that πi(A) and πi(X) are
ﬁnitely generated for each i. Thus 6. and Equation (10.19) imply that πi(A)
and πi(X) have isomorphic p-primary components and equal rank for i < n.
An application of the universal coeﬃcient theorem shows that a map
f : A →X induces a Z(P)-homology isomorphism in all degrees if and only
if it induces a Z(P)-cohomology isomorphism in all degrees.
Theorem 10.42 can be used to construct a functor (called the localization
of a space at P)
L(P) :
 simply connected spaces with
ﬁnitely generated homology
	
→{simply connected spaces }
so that:
1. there exists a natural transformation from the identity functor to
L(P), Φ : Id →L(P),
2. for each X, Φ : X →L(P)(X) induces an isomorphism in Z(P)-
homology, and
3. H∗(L(P)(X); Z(P)) = H∗(L(P)(X); Z).

314
10. Further Applications of Spectral Sequences
We write
L(P)(X) = X(P).
The space X(P) is a good enough approximation to X to compute the p-
primary part of its homotopy groups for p ∈P, i.e. the p-primary part of
πnX is isomorphic to the p-primary part of πn(X(P)) for p ∈P and the
q-primary part of πn(X(P)) = 0 for q ̸∈P. In this manner one can study the
algebraic topology of spaces one prime at a time, by taking P = {p}, and
also the rational homotopy of a space, by taking P empty.
Such a functor L(P) : X →X(P) exists, and can be constructed by ﬁrst
constructing it for an Eilenberg–Maclane space K(π, n) and then using a
Postnikov decomposition of an arbitrary space into K(π, n)s.
We outline how to construct the localization functor L(P). For K(π, n)
with π a ﬁnitely generated abelian group one just replaces π by π ⊗Z(P).
The natural map π →π⊗Z(P) deﬁnes a (homotopy class of) map K(π, n) →
K(π ⊗Z(P), n). Thus we deﬁne
K(π, n)(P) = K(π ⊗Z(P), n).
For a general space one constructs X(P) inductively by assembling the
pieces of its Postnikov tower, pulling back its k-invariants using the Z(P)
cohomology isomorphisms.
Thus, if X has Postnikov system
,
πn = πn(X), Xn, pn : Xn →Xn−1, kn ∈Hn(Xn−1; πn−1)
-
,
then ﬁrst deﬁne (X2)(P) = K(π2 ⊗Z(P), 2).
Since X2 = K(π2, 2), the
homomorphism π2 →π2 ⊗Z(P) induces a map X2 →(X2)(P). The ﬁbra-
tion p3 : X3 →X2 is obtained by pulling back the path space ﬁbration
K(π3, 3) →∗→K(π3, 4) via k4 ∈H4(X2; π3) = [X2, K(π3, 4)]. Since the
map X2 →(X2)(P) induces an isomorphism
H4((X2)(P); π3 ⊗Z(P)) →H4(X2; π3 ⊗Z(P))
(10.20)
(using the universal coeﬃcient theorem), it follows that there is a unique
k4
(P) ∈H4((X2)(P); π3 ⊗Z(P)) so that the image of k4
(P) via the homo-
morphism of Equation (10.20) coincides with the image of k4 under the
coeﬃcient homomorphism
H4(X2; π3) →H4(X2; π3 ⊗Z(P)).
Inductively, if (Xk)(P) and ﬁbrations (Xk)(P) →(Xk−1)(P) with ﬁber
K(πk ⊗Z(P), k) classiﬁed by kk+1
(P) ∈Hk+1((Xk−1)(P); πk ⊗Z(P)) have been
deﬁned for k ≤n, deﬁne kn+2
(P) ∈Hn+2((Xn)(P); πn+1⊗Z(P)) to be the image
of the (n + 2)-nd Postnikov invariant of X, kn+2, under the composite
Hn+2(Xn; πn+1) →Hn+2(Xn; πn+1 ⊗Z(P)) ∼= Hn+2((Xn)(P); πn+1 ⊗Z(P)).

10.9. Localization
315
Then take (Xn+1)(P) to be total space in the ﬁbration pulled back from the
path space ﬁbration K(πn+1 ⊗Z(P), n + 1) →∗→K(πn+1 ⊗Z(P), n + 2)
using kn+2
(P) ∈Hn+2((Xn)(P); πn+1⊗Z(P)) = [(Xn)(P), K(πn+1⊗Z(P), n+2)].
Notice that the construction also gives a map Xn →(Xn)(P) inducing
the homomorphisms πk(X) = πk(Xn) →πk(Xn) ⊗Z(P) = πk((Xn)(P)) for
all k ≤n. Thus if X(P) denotes the space determined by the Postnikov
system (Xn)(P) with k-invariants kn+1
(P) , there is a map X →X(P) (this gives
the natural transformation Φ) so that the induced map πn(X) →πn(X(P))
coincides with
πn(X) →πn(X) ⊗Z(P),
a →a ⊗1.
From Theorem 10.42 we conclude that X →X(P) induces an isomor-
phism on homology with Z(P) coeﬃcients (and so also on cohomology with
Z(P) coeﬃcients). The facts that localization is functorial and that X →
X(P) deﬁnes a natural transformation Φ :Id→L(P) can be proven by carry-
ing out the construction we gave in a systematic fashion.
Here are some examples with P = φ to show you why localization is
useful. The space X(φ) is usually denoted by X(0) and is called the rational-
ization of X.
From Proposition 9.25 it follows that if n is odd, the map Sn →K(Z, n)
generating Hn(Sn) induces an isomorphism on rational cohomology, and
hence a homotopy equivalence Sn
(0) →K(Q, n) = K(Z, n)(0). Therefore
πk(Sn) ⊗Q = πk(K(Q, n)) = 0 for q ̸= n.
This implies that πk(Sn) is ﬁnite for k ̸= n.
For n even, Sn →K(Q, n) induces an isomorphism in rational homology
through dimensions 2n−1. Hence πk(Sn) is ﬁnite for k ≤2n−1, k ̸= n. We
can do better by taking E to be the homotopy ﬁber of the map K(Q, n) →
K(Q, 2n) representing ι2
n ∈H2n(K(Q, n)). The map Sn →K(Q, n) lifts to
E since H2n(Sn; Q) = 0. The long exact sequence in homotopy shows that
πk(E) =

Q
if k = n, 2n −1
0
otherwise.
Again, a simple application of the Leray–Serre spectral sequence for the
ﬁbration K(Q, 2n −1) →E →K(Q, n) and Proposition 9.25 shows that
H∗(E; Q) = H∗(Sn; Q); the isomorphism is induced by the map Sn →E.
Thus Sn
(0) = E and so πk(Sn)⊗Q = πk(E). This shows that πk(Sn) is ﬁnite
for k ̸= n, 2n −1 and that the rank of πk(Sn) is 1 for k = n or 2n −1.
These two calculations were obtained in Theorem 10.10 and Exercise
165 by similar arguments; the point is that the argument using localization
is conceptually much simpler since calculating with the Leray-Serre spectral

316
10. Further Applications of Spectral Sequences
sequence using rational coeﬃcients is easier than using integer coeﬃcients;
for example Ep,q
2
= Hp(B) ⊗Hq(F). Moreover, the rational cohomology of
K(Q, n) is simple and so constructing rational Postnikov systems which do
what we want is a more manageable problem than constructing an arbitrary
Postnikov system.
As a new example, consider the space CP n. The (rational) cohomol-
ogy ring of CP n is a truncated polynomial ring and the cohomology of
CP ∞is a polynomial ring.
The inclusion CP n →CP ∞= K(Z, 2) in-
duces isomorphisms on (rational) cohomology through dimension 2n. Let
c ∈H2(K(Q, 2)) denote the generator. Think of cn+1 ∈H2n+2(K(Q, 2))
as a map cn+1 : K(Q, 2) →K(Q, 2n + 2) and let E be its homotopy ﬁber.
The map CP n →K(Q, 2) lifts to E since H2n+2(CP n) = 0. The spectral
sequence for the ﬁbration K(Q, 2n+1) →E →K(Q, 2) and the calculation
(9.25) shows that CP n →E induces an isomorphism on rational cohomol-
ogy.
Exercise 188. Prove this to see how easy it is.
Using the long exact sequence in homotopy we conclude that
πk(CP n) ⊗Q = πk(E) =

Q
if k = 2, 2n + 1,
0
otherwise.
Since CP n is a ﬁnite complex this shows that πk(CP n) is ﬁnite for k ̸=
2, 2n + 1 and has rank 1 for k = 2 and k = 2n + 1.
Another application is to Chern classes and Bott periodicity for the
unitary group. First, we have the following complex analogue of Theorem
10.40.
Theorem 10.43. Let BU(n) denote the classifying space for U(n). Then
The cohomology ring of BU(n)is a polynomial ring:
H∗(BU(n); Z) = Z[c1, c2, · · · , cn]
where the generators ck have degree 2k. The inclusion U(n −1) →U(n)
induces a map H∗(BU(n)) →H∗(BU(n −1)) which preserves the ck.
Exercise 189. Prove Theorem 10.43 using induction, and the multiplica-
tive properties of the Leray–Serre spectral sequence for the ﬁbration
S2n−1 →BU(n −1) →BU(n)
obtained by delooping the ﬁbration U(n −1) →U(n) →S2n−1 twice. You
may use the proof of Theorem 10.40 as a guide, but the argument in this
case is much simpler.

10.10. Construction of bordism invariants
317
The class ck ∈H2k(BU(n); Z) is called the kth Chern class.
Since
isomorphism classes of Cn-vector bundles are classiﬁed by homotopy classes
of maps to BU(n), the Chern classes determine characteristic classes of
complex vector bundles. By construction, ck is a stable class, i.e. if E is
a complex vector bundle and ϵC denotes the trivial 1-dimensional complex
vector bundle, then ck(E⊕ϵC) is sent to ck(E) by the map Hk(BU(n+1)) →
Hk(BU(n)).
Now consider the map BU(n) →n
k=1 K(Q, 2k) given by the product
of the Chern classes, thinking of ck ∈H2k(BU(n); Q) = [BU(n); K(Q, 2k)].
By the K¨unneth theorem and 9.25 this map induces an isomorphism on ratio-
nal cohomology. Therefore the rationalization of BU(n) is just n
k=1 K(Q, 2k).
Since Ω(X × Y ) = ΩX × ΩY , ΩZ =pt if Z is discrete, and ΩK(G, n) ∼
K(G, n −1), we see that
Ω2BU(n)(0) = Ω2(
n

k=1
K(Q, 2k)) ∼
n−1

k=0
K(Q, 2k) ∼Q × BU(n −1)(0).
In particular, letting n go to inﬁnity we obtain a proof of the rational form
of Bott periodicity:
Ω2(Q × BU(0)) ∼Q × BU(0).
10.10. Construction of bordism invariants
We ﬁnish this chapter with some comments on Thom’s computation of the
unoriented bordism groups. An invariant of unoriented bordism is a homo-
morphism w : ΩO
n →G for some abelian group G. Since 2M = ∂(M ×I), the
group ΩO
n is a 2-torsion abelian group. Thus to construct bordism invariants
one might as well restrict to constructing homomorphisms w : ΩO
n →Z/2.
Thom computed ΩO
n in this fashion for all n in his famous 1954 paper [40].
He did this by ﬁnding enough bordism invariants (the Stiefel-Whitney num-
bers) wα : ΩO
n →Z/2 so that the sum
⊕
α wα : ΩO
n →⊕
α Z/2
is an isomorphism.
We will outline some of the ingredients in Thom’s arguments.
Proposition 10.44. Let
w = wi1
1 · · · win
n ∈Hn(BO(n)),
so i1 + 2i2 + · · · + nin = n. If M is a smooth n-manifold then the number
⟨w(TM), [M]⟩∈Z/2
is a bordism invariant.

318
10. Further Applications of Spectral Sequences
Proof. Since the expression ⟨w(TM), [M]⟩is additive with respect to the
sum in the bordism group (disjoint union), it suﬃces to show that if M is
null-bordant, i.e. M = ∂W, then ⟨w(TM), [M]⟩= 0.
The tangent bundle of W and M are related by TM ⊕ϵ = TW|M. Hence
if i : M ⊂W denotes the inclusion,
⟨w(TM), [M]⟩= ⟨w(TM ⊕ϵ), [M]⟩
= ⟨w(i∗(TW)), [M]⟩
= ⟨i∗(w(TW)), [M]⟩
= i∗(w(TW)) ∩[M]
= w(TW) ∩i∗[M] = 0,
since in the sequence Hn+1(W, M)
∂−→Hn(M)
i∗
−→Hn(W) the map labelled
∂takes the generator [W, M] to [M].
Deﬁnition 10.45. A partition of the positive integer n is an n–tuple of
non-negative integers (i1, · · · , in) so that i1 + 2i2 + · · · + nin = n.
Given a partition (i1, · · · , in) of n, the number
⟨wi1
1 · · · win
n (TM), [M]⟩∈Z/2
is called the Stiefel–Whitney number associated to the partition (i1, · · · , in).
Thus to each partition α = (i1, · · · , in) of n we have associated the
bordism invariant whose value on the manifold M is
wα(M) = ⟨wi1
1 · · · win
n (TM), [M]⟩.
Thom’s theorem is the following.
Theorem 10.46. Let S denote the set of partitions of n so that ik = 0
whenever k has the form 2ℓ−1. Then the map taking a manifold to its
Stiefel–Whitney numbers induces an isomorphism
⊕α∈S wα : ΩO
n →⊕α∈S Z/2.
In other words, the unoriented bordism class of a manifold is determined by
its Stiefel–Whitney numbers, and given any partition α ∈S there exists an
n-manifold M with wα(M) ̸= 0, but wβ(M) = 0 for β ̸= α.
Thom proves this theorem by a method analogous to the example of
BU(0) we gave in the previous section. First, Thom ﬁnds suﬃciently many
examples of manifolds with the appropriate Stiefel–Whitney numbers, and
then he uses these to deﬁne a map from the Thom spectrum to a prod-
uct of Eilenberg-MacLane spectra K(Z/2). He shows this map induces an
isomorphism on homology, using the Thom isomorphism to compute the
cohomology of the Thom spectrum as a module over the mod 2 Steenrod

algebra. The Whitehead theorem then implies that the map is a homotopy
equivalence, and so the Stiefel–Whitney numbers classify bordism.

There are some useful results; you should lecture on some or all of these.
Since Sm has a cell structure with only one 0-cell and one m-cell, the
product Sk × Sn has a cell structure with 4 cells, a 0-cell e0 × e0, a k-cell
ek × e0, an n-cell e0 × en, and a (k + n)-cell ek × en. Removing the top cell
leaves the wedge
Sk × Sn −(ek × en) = Sk ∨Sn.
Let a : Sk+n−1 →Sk ∨Sn denote the attaching map for the (top) (k+n)-cell

The map a can be used to construct interesting elements in πnX.

product [f, g] ∈πk+n−1X to be the (homotopy class of) the composite
Sk+n−1
a−→Sk ∨Sn
f∨g
−−→X.
For example, if k = n = 1, the attaching map for the 2-cell of a torus
represents the commutator of the two generators, and hence the Whitehead
product π1X ×π1X →π1X takes a pair of loops to their commutator. Since
π2(X) is abelian, the suspension map s∗: π1X →π1(ΩSX) = π2(X) takes
any commutator to zero. More generally show (or look up) the following
fact.
Proposition 10.48. The suspension of the attaching map for the top cell
of Sk × Sn,
Sa : S(Sk+n−1) = Sk+n →S(Sk ∨Sn),
is nullhomotopic. Hence s∗([f, g]) = 0 for any f ∈πkX, g ∈πnX, i.e. the
Whitehead product [f, g] is in the kernel of the suspension homomorphism
πn+k−1(X) →πn+kSX.
Thus Whitehead products produce decidedly unstable elements in πmX.
The map s : X →ΩSX (deﬁned in Section 10.3) induces the suspension
homomorphism s∗: πℓ(X) →πℓ(ΩSX) = πℓ+1SX. It can be studied in a
large range (the “metastable range”) by using the EHP sequence:

10. Further Applications of Spectral Sequences
Theorem 10.49. If X is an (n −1)-connected space, there is an exact
sequence
π3n−2(X)
s∗
−→π3n−1(SX) →π3n−1(SX ∧X) →π3n−3(X) →· · ·
· · · →πk(X) →πk+1(SX) →πk+1(SX ∧X) →· · ·
The map s∗is sometimes denoted “E” in the literature (from the German
word “Einh¨angung” for suspension), the map πk+1(SX) →πk+1(SX ∧X) is
usually denoted by “H” since it generalizes the Hopf invariant, and the map
πk+1(SX ∧X) →πk(X) is usually denoted “P” since its image is generated
by Whitehead Products. Hence the name EHP sequence.
Thus, in the range k ≤3n−2, the EHP sequence gives some control over
what the kernel and cokernel of the suspension map on homotopy groups is.
An important special case of the EHP sequence is obtained by setting
X = Sn. The sequence is
π3n−2Sn →π3n−1Sn+1 →π3n−1S2n+1 →π3n−3Sn →· · ·
(10.21)
A proof of Theorem 10.49 can be found in [43] (although it is hard to
reconstruct the argument since it is explained as a consequence of a more
general result of James).
The proof that (10.21) is exact as well as the
material below on the Hopf invariant can be found in [36, Section 9.3].
After substituting π2n+1S2n+1 = Z a part of the sequence (10.21) can
be written:
· · · π2nSn →π2n+1Sn+1
H
−→Z →π2n−1Sn →· · ·
If n is even, Theorem 10.10 implies that the map H is zero and therefore
π2nSn →π2n+1Sn+1 is onto. The Freudenthal suspension theorem implies
that π2n+1Sn+1 →π2n+2Sn+2 = πS
n is onto, and so we conclude that for n
even, π2nSn →πS
n is onto.
If n is odd, then Exercise 165 shows that π2n+1Sn+1/torsion= Z. Since
π2nSn is ﬁnite the map H : π2n+1Sn+1 →Z is non-zero; it is called the Hopf
invariant.
The famous “Hopf invariant one” problem, solved by J.F. Adams, asserts
that H is onto only for n + 1 = 1, 2, 4, and 8; and in fact the Hopf ﬁbrations
are the only maps which have Hopf invariant one. The Whitehead product
[i, i] ∈π2n−1Sn+1, where i ∈πn+1Sn+1 denotes the generator, has Hopf
invariant 2.
There are several other deﬁnitions of the Hopf Invariant for a map f :
S2n+1 →Sn, and you should lecture on some of these. Here are two.
1. Assume that f is smooth (this can always be arranged by a small
homotopy) and let x0, x1 ∈Sn+1 be two regular values of f.
Let

10.11. Projects for Chapter 10
321
M0 = f−1(x0) and M1 = f−1(x1). Then H(f) =lk(M0, M1), where
“lk” denotes the linking number.
2. Let X be the CW-complex obtained by attaching a (2n + 2)-cell to
Sn+1 using f as the attaching map. Then Hq(X) = Z for q = 0, n+1,
and 2n + 2, and is zero otherwise. Let en+1 ∈Hn+1(X) and e2n+2 ∈
H2n+2(X) denote the generators. Then (en+1)2 = H(f)e2n+2.


Chapter 11
Simple-Homotopy
Theory
Two basic references for the material in this chapter are Cohen’s book [7]
and Milnor’s article [28].
11.1. Introduction
Whitehead’s theorem says that a map f : X →Y between CW-complexes
is a homotopy equivalence if f∗: πnX →πnY is an isomorphism for all n.
Thus homotopy groups and hence the tools of homotopy theory give impor-
tant information about the homotopy type of a space. However, important
questions in geometric topology center around distinguishing homeomor-
phism types within a class of homotopy equivalent manifolds, to which the
methods we have studied so far do not directly apply.
For example, suppose W is a compact manifold with two boundary com-
ponents: ∂W = M0 ⨿M1. Suppose the inclusion M0 →W is a homotopy
equivalence. Is W homeomorphic to M0 × [0, 1], and, in particular, is M0
homeomorphic to M1? The answer to this question is provided by the s-
cobordism theorem (see Section 11.7) which states that there exists a functor
Wh: {Groups} →{Abelian groups}
so that in the situation described above, an element τ(W, M0) ∈Wh(π1W)
is deﬁned and vanishes if W is homeomorphic to M0 × [0, 1]. Conversely,
if the dimension of M0 is greater than 4 and τ(W, M0) = 0, then W is
homeomorphic to M0 × [0, 1].
323

324
11. Simple-Homotopy Theory
Of course the point of this theorem is that the functor Wh has a functo-
rial, geometric, and somewhat computable deﬁnition. (One could stupidly
deﬁne Wh(π) = Z/2 for all groups π and deﬁne τ(W, M0) to be 0 or 1
according to whether or not W is homeomorphic to a product.)
In this chapter we will give the complete deﬁnition of the Whitehead
group Wh(π) and the Whitehead torsion τ.
Exercise 190. Use the fact that Wh(1) = 0 to prove the generalized Poin-
car´e conjecture for n > 5: a closed manifold Σ which has the homotopy
type of Sn is homeomorphic to Sn. (Hint: Remove two open disks; it can
be shown that the complement has the homotopy type of a CW-complex.
Assume this and apply the s-cobordism theorem.)
Another collection of examples is provided by lens spaces. We will use
obstruction theory to give a homotopy classiﬁcation of 3-dimensional lens
spaces, and then use the machinery of simple-homotopy theory to prove the
following theorem.
Theorem 11.1.
1. Three–dimensional lens spaces L(p, q) and L(p′, q′) are homotopy equiv-
alent if and only if p = p′ and there exists an integer b so that
q ≡±b2q′ mod p.
2. Moreover, L(p, q) is homeomorphic to L(p, q′) if and only if p = p′
and q ≡±(q′)±1 mod p.
In particular L(7, 1) and L(7, 2) are closed three-manifolds which have
the same homotopy type but are not homeomorphic. Whitehead torsion
must be a subtle and powerful invariant to make such a distinction.
J.H.C. Whitehead developed the theory of simple-homotopy equivalence,
a reﬁnement of homotopy equivalence for ﬁnite CW-complexes which takes
into account the cell structure. It was proven by Chapman that homeomor-
phic ﬁnite CW-complexes are simple-homotopy equivalent. Hence simple-
homotopy theory provides a weapon by which to attack homeomorphism
problems that are impervious to the homotopy theoretic machinery devel-
oped in the previous chapters.
Suppose X, Y are ﬁnite CW-complexes. Then a cellular map f : X →Y
is a homotopy equivalence if and only if the mapping cylinder of f deforma-
tion retracts to X via a cellular map.
Exercise 191. Prove this using obstruction theory.
The geometric approach of simple-homotopy theory is to investigate
when a pair (K, L) which admits a deformation retract of K to L admits a
particular “simple” type of deformation.

11.1. Introduction
325
In this chapter a ﬁnite CW-pair (K, L) will mean a CW-complex K with
ﬁnitely many cells and a subcomplex L ⊂K. Thus L is a closed subspace
of K which is a union of cells. (See Deﬁnition 1.3 for the deﬁnition of a
CW-complex.) We will also use inﬁnite CW-pairs, but these will always be
of the form ( ˜K, ˜L) where (K, L) is a ﬁnite CW-pair, ˜K →K a covering
space, and ˜L the inverse image of L in ˜K.
Deﬁnition 11.2. If (K, L) is a ﬁnite CW-pair, we say K collapses to L
by an elementary collapse, denoted K ↘e L, if the following two conditions
hold.
1. K = L ∪en−1 ∪en where the cells en−1 and en are not in L.
2. Write ∂Dn = Sn−1 = Dn−1
+
∪Sn−2 Dn−1
−
. Then there exists a charac-
teristic map ϕ : Dn →K for en so that
(a) ϕ|Dn−1
+
: Dn−1
+
→K is a characteristic map for en−1, and
(b) ϕ(Dn−1
−
) ⊂L.
Thus K is obtained by gluing Dn to L along a map Dn−1
−
−→L, where
Dn−1
−
⊂∂Dn ⊂Dn.
en−1
en
L
K
Note K can be viewed as the mapping cylinder of a map Dn−1
−
→L.
Thus L is a deformation retract of K.
Deﬁnition 11.3.
1. One says that K collapses to L, or L expands to K, if there are
subcomplexes K = K0 ⊃K1 ⊃· · · ⊃Kn = L so that K0 ↘e K1 ↘e
· · · ↘e Kn. Write K ↘L, or L ↗K.
2. A map f : K →L is called a simple-homotopy equivalence if there
exists a ﬁnite sequence of CW-complexes K = K0, K1, . . . , Kn = L
so that f is homotopic to a composite K0 →K1 →K2 →· · · →Kn
where each map Ki →Ki+1 is either the inclusion map of an expan-
sion, the deformation retraction of a collapse, or a cellular homeo-
morphism.

326
11. Simple-Homotopy Theory
Exercise 192. Prove that simple-homotopy equivalence is an equivalence
relation.
We now give two examples concerned with collapsing. Suppose L is a
ﬁnite simplicial subcomplex of a triangulated open subset of Euclidean space.
Then the regular neighborhood K = N(L) is the union of all simplices whose
closure intersects L. This is an analogue of a normal bundle, but L does not
have to be a manifold. It is not diﬃcult to see that K ↘L.
The second example is where K is the “house with two rooms” pictured
below. Here K is a 2-dimensional CW-complex. To get to the large room
on the lower ﬂoor, you must enter the house from the top through the small
cylinder on the left. Similarly, one enters the upper room via the small right
cylinder. Then it is not diﬃcult to see that K is simple-homotopy equivalent
to a point, but that K does not collapse to a point, i.e. some expansions
are needed.
11.2. Invertible matrices and K1(R)
In this section we will deﬁne the Whitehead group and in the next section
deﬁne torsion. Since there are two sections of algebra coming up, we will
give you some geometric motivation to help you through.
It will turn out that the question of whether a homotopy equivalence is
simple can be understood in the following way. Assume f : L →K is a
cellular inclusion, and a homotopy equivalence. Then if π = π1L = π1K,
the relative chain complex C∗( ˜K, ˜L) (where ˜K, ˜L denotes universal covers)

11.2. Invertible matrices and K1(R)
327
is a free and acyclic Zπ-chain complex, and has a Zπ-basis labeled by the
cells of K −L.
Elementary collapses and changing base points change the cellular chain
complex C∗( ˜K, ˜L), and so one wants to classify acyclic, based chain com-
plexes over Zπ up to some equivalence relation, so that C∗( ˜K, ˜L) is equiv-
alent to 0 if and only if K →L is a simple-homotopy equivalence. The
main result will be that the chain complex C∗( ˜K, ˜L) determines an element
τ(K, L) ∈Wh(π) which vanishes if and only if the map f is a simple-
homotopy equivalence.
Once the machinery is set up, other useful applications will follow from
considering rings R more general than the integral group ring Zπ.
For
example, if Zπ →R is a ring homomorphism, it may be easier to work with
the chain complex R⊗ZπC∗than to work directly with C∗. This is especially
true if R is a commutative ring or, even better, a ﬁeld.
The simplest acyclic, based chain complexes are of the form:
0 →Cn
∂−→Cn−1 →0.
Since this complex is based, ∂is given by a matrix, which is invertible since
(C∗, ∂) is acyclic.
Motivated by the previous discussion, we study invertible matrices over a
(not necessarily commutative) ring R. We assume that all our rings are rings
with 1. Unfortunately, two bizarre phenomena can arise when considering
free modules over a ring R.
• It may be the case that Rm ∼= Rn with m ̸= n.
• It may be the case that M ⊕Rm ∼= Rn, but that M itself is not free.
In this case we say the module M is stably free but not free.
Fortunately, the ﬁrst problem does not occur for group rings, because
there is a homomorphism ϵ : Zπ →Z,  agg → ag. Thus (Zπ)m ∼= (Zπ)n
implies
Zm = Z ⊗Zπ (Zπ)m ∼= Z ⊗Zπ (Zπ)n = Zn
and so m = n. Henceforth
We assume all rings have the property that Rm ∼= Rm implies m = n.
Thus we exclude rings like the endomorphism ring of an inﬁnite-dimensional
vector space.
The second pathology does occur for certain group rings, so we cannot
assume it away. It will be a thorn in our side in the next section, but we
will deal with it.
Deﬁnition 11.4. Denote by GL(n, R) the group of all n × n matrices over
R which have a two-sided inverse. An inclusion GL(n, R) →GL(n + 1, R)

328

is deﬁned by

Let GL(R) = 2
n GL(n, R). Think of GL(R) as the group of all invert-
ible inﬁnite matrices which are “eventually” the identity. We will always
identify an invertible n×n matrix with its image in GL(R). In particular, if
A and B are invertible matrices, their product in GL(R) makes sense even
if their sizes are diﬀerent.
We next deﬁne an important subgroup of GL(R), the subgroup gener-
ated by elementary matrices.
Deﬁnition 11.5. E(R) ⊂GL(R) is the subgroup generated by the elemen-
tary matrices, i.e. the matrices of the form:
I + rEij (i ̸= j)
where I is the identity matrix, Eij is the matrix with 1 in the ij spot and
0’s elsewhere, and r ∈R.
The eﬀect of multiplying a matrix A by the elementary matrix I + rEij
on the right is the column operation which replaces the jth column of A by
the sum of the jth column of A and r times the ith column of A. Multiply-
ing A on the left by an elementary matrix performs the corresponding row
operation.
Recall that the commutator subgroup of a group G is the subgroup [G, G]
generated by all commutators ghg−1h−1 where g, h ∈G. This is the smallest
normal subgroup of G such that the corresponding quotient group is abelian.
Lemma 11.6 (Whitehead’s Lemma). The group generated by elementary
matrices equals the commutator subgroup of GL(R)
E(R) = [GL(R), GL(R)].
Proof. First, (I + rEij)−1 = I −rEij, and
EijEkℓ=

0
if j ̸= k
Eiℓ
if j = k.
Thus if i, j, k are distinct,
I + rEik = (I + rEij)(I + Ejk)(I + rEij)−1(I + Ejk)−1.
So any n × n elementary matrix with n ≥3 can be expressed as a commu-
tator. Hence E(R) ⊂[GL(R), GL(R)].
The opposite inclusion follows from the matrix identities

So E(R) is a normal subgroup of GL(R) with abelian quotient.
Deﬁnition 11.7.
K1(R) = GL(R)/E(R)
The quotient homomorphism GL(R) →K1(R), A →[A] should be
thought of as a generalized determinant function.
Exercise 193.
1. For a commutative ring R, there is a well-deﬁned map K1(R) →
R×, [A] →det A, which is a split epimorphism.
Here R× is the
group of units of R, where a unit is an element of R with a two-sided
multiplicative inverse.
2. For a ﬁeld F, show that K1(F) ∼= F × = F −{0}.
3. Show that K1(Z) = {[(±1)]} ∼= Z/2.
Exercise 194. Show that K1 is a functor from the category of rings with
1 to the category of abelian groups.
In fact, for every n ∈Z, there is a functor Kn, with the various Kn’s
intertwined by K¨unneth Theorems. Composing Kn with the functor taking
a group π to its integral group ring Zπ deﬁnes a functor π →Kn(Zπ) from
the category of groups to the category of abelian groups.
The following equalities in K1(R) are useful in computations and appli-
cations. They are reminiscent of properties of determinants.

The last three matrices are in E(R), so we see the assertion is true for
2 × 2 matrices. For a general 2-cycle σ, the same method shows that P
is equivalent to a diagonal matrix with 1’s down the diagonal except for a
single −1. By Part 1, this is equivalent to the 1 × 1 matrix (−1).
Every permutation is a product of 2-cycles so the result follows.
Theorem 11.8 shows that the group operation in the abelian group

Deﬁnition 11.9. Deﬁne the reduced K-group
K1(R) = K1(R)/[(−1)].
Using this group will allow us to use unordered bases for free modules.
Exercise 195. Let i : Z →R be the unique ring map from the integers to
R taking the 1 of Z to the 1 of R. Show that K1(R) is the cokernel of the
induced map K1(Z) →K1(R).
Now we switch to group rings. For a group ring, the map i : Z →Zπ
is split by the augmentation map ϵ : Zπ →Z,  agg → ag.
Hence
K1(Zπ) = Z/2 ⊕K1(Zπ).
If X is a CW-complex with fundamental group π and universal cover
˜X, then C∗( ˜X) is a free Zπ-chain complex with generators corresponding to
the cells of X. However, the generators are not uniquely determined by the
cells, in addition one must choose an orientation and a lift of the cell to the
cover. In other words, generators are determined only up to a multiple ±g
where g ∈π. This helps motivate the deﬁnition of the Whitehead group.
Deﬁnition 11.10. Let Eπ be the subgroup of GL(Zπ) generated by E(Zπ)
and 1 × 1 matrices (±g), where g ∈π. Then the Whitehead group of π is
Wh(π) = GL(Zπ)/Eπ = K1(Zπ)/{[(±g)] : g ∈π}.
The elements that we mod out by are represented by matrices of the
form






The Whitehead group is a functor from groups to abelian groups. There is
a short exact sequence of abelian groups
0 →{±1} × πab →K1(Zπ) →Wh(π) →0,
where πab = π/[π, π]. The reason for injectivity is that the composite of the
maps
{±1} × πab →K1(Zπ) →K1(Z[πab])
det
−−→Z[πab]×
is the inclusion.
The elements of the subgroup ±π = {±g : g ∈π} of (Zπ)× are called
the trivial units of Zπ. The ring Zπ might contain other units, depending

332
11. Simple-Homotopy Theory
on what π is. To some extent the existence of nontrivial units is measured
by the nontriviality of the Whitehead group, but the only precise statement
in this direction is that if π is abelian and Zπ contains nontrivial units, then
the Whitehead group Wh(π) is nontrivial. This uses that the determinant
map K1(R) →R× is a split epimorphism for a commutative ring.
Here are three interesting examples.
1. Let Z/5 have generator t. Then in Z[Z/5],
(1 −t + t2)(t + t2 −t4) = 1.
Thus 1 −t + t2 is a nontrivial unit and the Whitehead group is non-
trivial. It can be shown that Wh(Z/5) is inﬁnite cyclic with this unit
as generator.
2. It is easy to see that Z[Z] has only trivial units (exercise!). It can be
shown that Wh(Z) = 0.
3. This next example due to Whitehead is a nontrivial unit which rep-
resents the zero element of Wh(π).
Let π = ⟨x, y | y2 = 1⟩= Z ∗Z/2. Let a = 1 −y and b = x(1 + y)
in Zπ. Notice 1 −ab is a nontrivial unit, since (1 −ab)(1 + ab) = 1.
However we will show [(1 −ab)] is zero in the Whitehead group. It
can be shown that Wh(π) = 0.
Note that (1 −y)(x(1 + y)) = x + xy −yx −yxy ̸= 0 and (x(1 +
y))(1 −y) = x(1 −y2) = 0. So ab ̸= 0 and ba = 0.

Thus one must stabilize (i.e. include the 1 × 1 matrices into the
2×2 matrices) before 1−ab becomes “trivial”, i.e. becomes a product
of elementary matrices.
The actual computation of Whitehead groups can be a diﬃcult business,
involving number theory in the case of ﬁnite groups and geometry in the
case of inﬁnite groups. We mention a result and a conjecture. The result,
due to Bass-Milnor-Serre, is that Wh(Z/n) is a free abelian group of rank
[n/2] + 1 −d(n) where d(n) is the number of positive divisors of n [4]. The
conjecture (proven in many cases) is that Wh(π) = 0 when π is a torsion-free
group.
The next lemma will enable us to remove the dependence on base points
when we move to a geometric context.
In particular, it shows that the

11.2. Invertible matrices and K1(R)
333
assignment X →Wh(π1X) gives a well-deﬁned functor from the category
of path-connected spaces to the category of abelian groups.
Lemma 11.11. If f : π →π is the inner automorphism given by f(g) =
xgx−1 for some x ∈π, then the induced map on Whitehead groups f∗:
Wh(π) →Wh(π) is the identity map.
Proof. The automorphism f induces f : Zπ →Zπ by the formula
f(

ngg) =

ngxgx−1 = x(

ngg)x−1,
which in turn induces a group automorphism f : GL(n, Zπ) →GL(n, Zπ)
by A →(xI)A(x−1I). Hence,
f∗[A] = [xI · A · x−1I]
= [xI · x−1I · A]
since Wh(π) is abelian
= [A].
This is reminiscent of the fact that an inner automorphism of π induces
the identity on H∗(π), pointing out an analogy between the two functors
from groups to abelian groups.
We conclude this section with a remark about matrices over noncommu-
tative rings. If f : M →M′ is an isomorphism of R-modules and if M and
M′ have bases {b1, . . . , bn} and {b′
1, . . . , b′
n} respectively, we wish to deﬁne
[f] ∈K1(R) to be [F], where F is a matrix representative of f. There are
several ways to deﬁne a matrix for f, and the result depends on whether we
are working with right or left R-modules.
For our main application, the modules we take are the the cellular n-
chains on the universal cover of a CW-complex X.
These are right Zπ-
modules. For that reason we consider right R-modules and deﬁne the matrix
of a map f : M →M′ of right based R-modules to be (fij) where
f(bi) =
n

i=1
b′
jfij.
With this deﬁnition, assigning a matrix to a map of right based R-modules
(−) : HomR(M, M′) →Mn(R)
is an homomorphism, i.e. (f + g) = (f) + (g) and (fg) = (f)(g) and taking
the equivalence class deﬁnes a homomorphism
IsoR(M, M′) →K1(R), f →[(fij)].
We will write [f] = [(fij)] ∈K1(R).

11. Simple-Homotopy Theory
11.3. Torsion for chain complexes
We next make the transition from matrices to acyclic, based chain com-
plexes.
A based R-module is a free, ﬁnite-dimensional R-module with a
speciﬁed basis. A chain complex C∗over a ring R is bounded if there exists
an N so that Cn = 0 for |n| ≤N, bounded below if there exists an N so
that Cn = 0 for n ≥N, based if each Cn is based and C∗is bounded, free if
each Cn is free, projective if each Cn is projective, ﬁnite if ⊕Cn is ﬁnitely
generated, and acyclic if the homology of C∗is zero. We will often write
C instead of C∗. As above we assume that the ring R has the property
that Rm ∼= Rn implies that m = n. For example, a group ring Zπ has this
property since it maps epimorphically to Z.
Let K1(R) = K1(R)/[(−1)] where (−1) ∈GL(1, R). An isomorphism
f : M′ →M of based R-modules determines an element [f] ∈K1(R).
(The reason that we use K1 rather than K1 is that it is both messy and
unnecessary for us to fuss with ordered bases.)
We wish to generalize [f] is two ways. First, we wish to replace M and
M′ by chain complexes. Given a chain isomorphism f : C′ →C between
based chain complexes, deﬁne the torsion of f by
τ(f) =

(−1)n[fn : C′
n →Cn] ∈K1(R).
The second way we will generalize [f] is to consider f : M′ →M as a acyclic,
based chain complex
· · · →0 →M′
f−→M →0 →· · ·
Then we will have [f] = ±τ(f).
The following theorem gives an axiomatic characterization of the torsion
τ(C) of a acyclic, based chain complex. Its proof will be an easy consequence
of Theorem 11.14 discussed below.
Theorem 11.12. Let C be the class of acyclic, based chain complexes over
R. Then there is a unique map C →K1(R), C →τ(C) satisfying the follow-
ing axioms:
1. If f : C →C′ is a chain isomorphism, then τ(f) = τ(C′) −τ(C).
2. τ(C ⊕C′) = τ(C) + τ(C′).
3. τ(0 →Cn
f−→Cn−1 →0) = (−1)n−1[f].
Deﬁnition 11.13. For an R-module M and an integer n, deﬁne the ele-
mentary chain complex E(M, n)
E(M, n)i =

0
if i ̸= n, n −1
M
if i = n, n −1,

and with all diﬀerentials zero except ∂n = Id : E(M, n)n →E(M, n)n−1. A
simple chain complex is a ﬁnite direct sum of elementary chain complexes
of the form E(Rkn, n).
For example, if K collapses to L by an elementary collapse, then C( ˜K, ˜L)
is an elementary chain complex with M = R = Zπ. If K collapses to L,
then C( ˜K, ˜L) is a simple chain complex.
Note that a simple chain complex is a acyclic, based complex. It is of
the shape pictured below.

Theorem 11.14.
1. Let f : C →C′ be a chain isomorphism between simple chain com-
plexes. Then τ(f) = 0 ∈K1(R).
2. Let C be a ﬁnite, free, acyclic chain complex. There are simple chain
complexes E and F and a chain isomorphism f : E →C ⊕F.
Corollary 11.15. Let C be a acyclic, based chain complex. If E, F, E′,
F ′ are simple chain complexes and if f : E →C ⊕F and g : E′ →C ⊕F ′
are chain isomorphisms, then τ(f) = τ(g).
Proof. Consider the three chain isomorphisms
˜f = f ⊕IdF ′ : E ⊕F ′ →C ⊕F ⊕F ′
˜p = IdC ⊕s : C ⊕F ⊕F ′ →C ⊕F ′ ⊕F
˜g = g ⊕IdF : E′ ⊕F →C ⊕F ′ ⊕F
where s : F ⊕F ′ →F ′ ⊕F is the obvious switch map. We then have
0 = τ(˜g−1 ◦˜p ◦˜f)
by Theorem 11.14, Part 1
= τ(˜g−1) + τ(˜p) + τ( ˜f)
= −τ(g) + τ(f)
Theorem 11.8, Part 2 shows that τ(˜p) = 0.
We can now use the previous theorem and corollary to deﬁne torsion.
Deﬁnition 11.16. Let C be a acyclic, based complex. Deﬁne the torsion
of C by
τ(C) = τ(f : E →C ⊕F)
where E, F are simple chain complexes and f is a chain isomorphism.

Exercise 196. Prove Theorem 11.12 assuming Theorem 11.14 and Corol-
lary 11.15.
What remains is to prove Theorem 11.14. We strongly advise you to
put down this book and prove the theorem by yourself, assuming (at ﬁrst),
that all stably free modules are free.
Welcome back! The proof that we give for Part 1 is the same as you
found, but the proof we will give for Part 2 uses the fundamental lemma
of homological algebra and is much slicker and less illuminating that the
inductive proof you ﬁgured out.
We separate out Part 1 as a Lemma.
Lemma 11.17. Let f : C →C′ be a chain isomorphism between simple
chain complexes. Then τ(f) = 0 ∈K1(R).
Proof. Write
Cn = E(Rkn, n)n ⊕E(Rkn+1, n + 1)n = C′
n.

Before we prove Part 2 we need some preliminaries.
Deﬁnition 11.18. A chain contraction s : C →C for a chain complex C
is a sequence of maps sn : Cn →Cn+1 satisfying ∂n+1sn + sn−1∂n = IdCn.
A chain contraction is a chain homotopy between the identity map and
the zero map. If C has a chain contraction then H∗(C) = 0.

11.3. Torsion for chain complexes
337
Proposition 11.19. Let s : C →C be a chain contraction.
Let Bn =
∂(Cn+1) ⊂Cn.
1. Cn = Bn ⊕s(Bn−1).
2. ∂: s(Bn) →Bn is an isomorphism with inverse s : Bn →s(Bn).
3. C is isomorphic to the direct sum of chain complexes ⊕nE(Bn, n+1).
Proof. Consider the short exact sequence
0 →Bn →Cn
∂−→Bn−1 →0.
The formula x = ∂s(x)+s∂(x) is valid for all x. So ∂s(x) = x−s∂(x) = x
for x ∈Bn and for s(y) with y ∈Bn, s∂s(y) = s(y) −s∂∂(y) = s(y). This
shows that this short exact sequence is split by sn−1 : Bn−1 →Cn, proving
the ﬁrst and second assertions.
The map
Cn = Bn ⊕s(Bn−1) →Bn ⊕Bn−1 = E(Bn, n + 1)n ⊕E(Bn−1, n)n
a ⊕b →a ⊕∂b
is an isomorphism by the second assertion. It is easy to check that this is a
chain map.
Lemma 11.20.
1. If C is projective, acyclic, and bounded below, then C has a chain
contraction.
2. If C is ﬁnite, free, and acyclic, the modules s(Bn) are stably free for
all n.
Proof.
1. By reindexing if necessary, assume that Cn = 0 for n negative. Then
by the fundamental lemma of homological algebra (Theorem 2.22),
the identity and the zero map are chain maps from C to C inducing
the same map on H0, hence are chain homotopic.
2. By Proposition 11.19, Cn ∼= Bn ⊕Bn−1. Using induction on n, one
sees Bn is stably free for all n.
Proof of Theorem 11.14. We have already proven Part 1.
Let C be a ﬁnite, free, acyclic chain complex. Then there is a chain
contraction s : C →C by Lemma 11.20, and hence C is chain isomorphic
to ⊕nE(Bn, n + 1) by Proposition 11.19. Now for every n there is a ﬁnitely

338
11. Simple-Homotopy Theory
generated free module Fn so that Bn⊕Fn is free. Give it a ﬁnite basis. Then
C ⊕(⊕nE(Fn, n + 1)) is chain isomorphic to the simple complex ⊕nE(Bn ⊕
Fn, n + 1).
Exercise 197. Show that for a acyclic, based chain complex C with a chain
contraction s, that s + ∂: Codd →Ceven is an isomorphism and [s + ∂] =
τ(C) ∈K1(R). Here Codd = ⊕C2i+1 and Ceven = ⊕C2i. This is called
“wrapping up” the chain complex and is the approach to torsion used in [7].
An isomorphism of based R-modules f : M →M′ determines an ele-
ment [f] ∈K1(R). We generalized this in two ways: to τ(f) for a chain
isomorphism between based chain complexes, and to τ(C) for an acyclic,
based chain complex.
We wish to generalize further and deﬁne τ(f) for
f : C →C′ a chain homotopy equivalence between based complexes. We
need some useful constructs from homological algebra.
Deﬁnition 11.21. Let f : C →C′ be a chain map between chain com-
plexes. Deﬁne the algebraic mapping cone of f to be the chain complex
C(f) where

the cylinder on C
Cyl(C) = M(Id : C →C),
and the suspension of C, which is the chain complex SC where (SC)n =
Cn−1 and ∂SC(x) = −∂C(x). Note Hn(SC) = Hn−1(C).
If the chain complexes involved are based, then C(f), M(f), Cone(C),
Cyl(C), and SC have obvious bases.

11.3. Torsion for chain complexes

All of these constructions are interrelated. There are short exact se-
quences of chain complexes
0 →C′ →C(f) →SC →0
(11.1)
0 →C →M(f) →C(f) →0
(11.2)
0 →C′ →M(f) →Cone(C) →0.
(11.3)
Here is some geometric motivation. If f : X →Y is a cellular map
between CW-complexes, and f∗: C∗(X) →C∗(Y ) is the associated cellular
chain map, then the mapping cone C(f), the mapping cylinder M(f), the
reduce cone CX, and the reduced suspension SX all have CW-structures.
One can make the following identiﬁcations
C(f∗) = C∗(C(f), pt)
M(f∗) = C∗(M(f))
Cone(C∗(X)) = C∗(CX, pt)
Cyl(C∗(X)) = C∗(I × X)
S(C∗(X)) = C∗(SX, pt).
The exact sequence 11.1 gives a long exact sequence in homology
· · · →Hn(C) →Hn(C′) →Hn(C(f)) →Hn−1(C) →· · ·
and one can check easily that the map Hn(C) →Hn(C′) is just the map
induced by f. In particular, if f induces an isomorphism in homology, then
C(f) is acyclic.
Deﬁnition 11.22. A chain map f : C →C′ is a weak homotopy equivalence
if it induces an isomorphism on homology. If f is a weak homotopy equiv-
alence between ﬁnite, based chain complexes, then C(f) is a ﬁnite, acyclic,
based chain complex. Deﬁne
τ(f) = τ(C(f)).
Exercise 198. If f : C →C′ is a chain isomorphism of ﬁnite, based com-
plexes, we unfortunately have two diﬀerent deﬁnitions of the torsion τ(f):
as (−1)n[fn : C′
n →Cn] and as τ(C(f)). Show that they coincide.
The justiﬁcation for the term weak homotopy equivalence is given by
the following algebraic analogue of Whitehead’s theorem.
Exercise 199. If f : C →C′ is a weak homotopy equivalence between
acyclic, projective chain complexes which are bounded below, then C(f)
has a chain contraction and f is a chain homotopy equivalence, i.e. there is
a chain map g : C′ →C so that f ◦g and g ◦f are homotopic to identity
maps.

11. Simple-Homotopy Theory
Theorem 11.23. Let
0 →C′
i−→C
p−→C′′ →0
be a short exact sequence of acyclic, based chain complexes. Assume the
bases are compatible, which means that for every n, the basis of Cn is of the
form
{i(b′
1), i(b′
2), . . . , i(b′
ij), c′′
1, c′′
2, . . . , c′′
ik} ⊂Cn
where
{b′
1, b′

n
is the given basis for C′
n and
{p(c′′
1), p(c′′
2), . . . , p(c′′
ik)} ⊂C′′
n
is the given basis for C′′
n. Then τ(C) = τ(C′) + τ(C′′).
Lemma 11.24. Let
0 →C′
i−→C
p−→C′′ →0
be a short exact sequence of free chain complexes which are bounded below.
If i is a weak homotopy equivalence, there is a chain map s : C →C′ which
splits i. Hence C ∼= C′ ⊕C′′.
Proof. The algebraic mapping cone C(i) is free, acyclic, and bounded be-
low. Hence there is a chain contraction

: Cn(i) = Cn−1 ⊕C′
n →Cn−1(i) = Cn−2 ⊕C′
n−1.
It is easy to see that s21 = 0 and that s12 : C →C′ is a chain map which
splits i.
Proof of Theorem 11.23. Let f : C →C′⊕C′′ be the chain isomorphism
given by Lemma 11.24. Since f is a chain isomorphism,
τ(f) = τ(C′ ⊕C′′) −τ(C)
= τ(C′) + τ(C′′) −τ(C)
On the other hand, since the bases are compatible, then the matrix of fn is

in block matrix form after partitioning each basis into its ′ part
and its ′′ part. But such a matrix is trivial in K1(R) by Theorem 11.8.
Corollary 11.25. If f : C →C′ is a chain map of acyclic, based chain
complexes, then τ(f) = τ(C′) −τ(C).
This follows from Lemma 11.23 and the short exact sequence 11.1.
We wish to prove homotopy invariance and additivity of torsion. The
next lemma is a key ingredient.

11.3. Torsion for chain complexes
341
Lemma 11.26. If C is a based chain complex, then Cone(C) is a acyclic,
based chain complex with trivial torsion.
Proof. Cone(C) is ﬁnite with an obvious basis; we will show Cone(C) is
acyclic by induction on the total rank
 dim Ci. If the total rank is 1,
both assertions are clear.
Suppose C is a based chain complex of total rank n > 1. Let b be a
basis element of C of minimal degree. Let C′ = {· · · →0 →Rb →0 · · · →}
be the corresponding subcomplex of C and let C′′ = C/C′ be the quotient
complex. There is a short exact sequence of ﬁnite complexes
0 →C′ →C →C′′ →0
with compatible bases. It is easy to see there is a short exact sequence of
ﬁnite complexes
0 →Cone(C′) →Cone(C) →Cone(C′′) →0
with compatible bases. By induction, Cone(C′) and Cone(C′′) are acyclic
with trivial torsion. By the long exact sequence in homology, Cone(C) is
acyclic, and by Theorem 11.23, Cone(C) has trivial torsion.
Theorem 11.27. Let C and D be based chain complexes and let f, g : C →
D be weak homotopy equivalences which are chain homotopic. In symbols,
f ≃g : C

Then τ(f) = τ(g).

satisfying s∂+ ∂s = f −g. Then F =

s

-
: Cyl(C) →D is a chain
map. There is a short exact sequence
0 →C(f) →C(F) →Cone(C) →0
of chain complexes. Then τ(f) = τ(F) by Lemma 11.26 and Theorem 11.23.
Likewise τ(g) = τ(F).
Exercise 200. Let X and Y be ﬁnite complexes and f and g be cellu-
lar homotopy equivalences from X to Y which are homotopic. Show that
the mapping cylinder of f is simple-homotopy equivalent to the mapping
cylinder to g.
Finally, there an additivity property of torsion.
Theorem 11.28. Let f : C →C′ and g : C′ →C′′ be weak homotopy
equivalences between based chain complexes. Then
τ(g ◦f) = τ(f) + τ(g).

342
11. Simple-Homotopy Theory
The idea is to convert g to an inclusion and analyze what happens. To
this end we need a deﬁnition and a lemma.
Deﬁnition 11.29. A chain map f : C →C′ between based complexes is
a based injection if for all n, the map f : Cn →C′
n is an injection and f
applied to the basis of Cn is a subset of the basis of C′
n.
Lemma 11.30.
1. Let g : C′ →C′′ be a based injection which is a weak homotopy
equivalence. Then τ(g) = τ(C′′/C′).
2. Let f : C →C′ and g : C′ →C′′ be weak homotopy equivalences
between based chain complexes. If g is a based injection, then
τ(g ◦f) = τ(f) + τ(C′′/C′).
Proof. We prove Part 2 ﬁrst. There is a based injection
Id
0
0
gn

: C(f)n = Cn−1 ⊕C′
n →C(g ◦f) = Cn−1 ⊕C′′
n.
This is part of a short exact sequence of chain complexes
0 →C(f) →C(g ◦f) →C′′/C′ →0
with compatible bases. The result follows by Theorem 11.23. Part 1 is a
special case of Part 2 taking f = Id and applying Theorem 11.23 and Lemma
11.26.
Proof of Theorem 11.28. As advertised, we convert g to an inclusion and
consider chain maps
C
g◦f
−−→C′′ →M(g).
Then
τ(C →M(g)) = τ(g ◦f) + τ(M(g)/C′′)
by Lemma 11.30
= τ(g ◦f) + τ(Cone(g))
by 11.3
= τ(g ◦f)
by Lemma 11.26.
Finally, we consider the chain maps
C
f−→C′ →M(g).
and see
τ(g ◦f) = τ(C →M(g))
we just proved this
= τ(f) + τ(M(g)/C′)
by Lemma 11.30
= τ(f) + τ(C(g))
by 11.2
= τ(f) + τ(g).

11.4. Whitehead torsion for CW-complexes
343
Perhaps the homotopy invariance and additivity of torsion are analogous
to the homotopy invariance and functoriality of homology.
11.4. Whitehead torsion for CW-complexes
Let K be a ﬁnite CW-complex. Assume that K is connected. Let x0 ∈K
and let π = π1(K, x0). We identify π with the group of covering transfor-
mations of the universal cover ˜K →K in the usual way. We have seen (in
Chapter 5) that C∗( ˜K) is a free Zπ-chain complex. A basis of this chain
complex is obtained by choosing a lift ˜e ⊂˜K for each cell e of K, and
choosing an orientation of e or, equivalently, ˜e. The set of lifts of cells of K
with the chosen orientations deﬁnes a basis over Zπ for the free Zπ-chain
complex C∗( ˜K).
Now suppose that f : K →L is a homotopy equivalence of ﬁnite CW-
complexes. We can homotop f to a cellular map g : K →L, which in turn
deﬁnes a weak homotopy equivalence of based Zπ-chain complexes
g∗: C∗( ˜K) →C∗(˜L).
Hence we have all the data needed to deﬁne torsion as in the previous
section. Deﬁne
τ(f) = τ(g∗) ∈Wh(π) = K1(Zπ)/ ± π.
The main geometric result of simple-homotopy theory is the following.
Theorem 11.31. Let f : K →L be a homotopy equivalence of ﬁnite CW-
complexes. Deﬁne the torsion τ(f) as above.
1. The torsion τ(f) is well-deﬁned, independent of choice of orienta-
tions, lifts, base point x0, identiﬁcation of π with the group of covering
transformations, and cellular approximation g.
2. If f is a simple-homotopy equivalence, then τ(f) = 0.
3. If τ(f) = 0, then f is a simple-homotopy equivalence.
Proof. We give complete proofs of Part 1 and 2, but only the vaguest of
sketches for the proof of Part 3.

344
11. Simple-Homotopy Theory
Changing the lift and orientation of a cell replaces ˜e by ±γ˜e for some
γ ∈π. Thus the torsion changes by the change of basis matrix

= 0 ∈Wh(π).
The choice of base point and the identiﬁcation of π with the group of covering
transformations is dealt with by Lemma 11.11 which says that conjugation
in π induces the identity map on Wh(π). Independence of the choice of
cellular approximation follows from Theorem 11.27, the homotopy invariance
of torsion.
Next we need to show that if f : K →L is a simple-homotopy equiv-
alence then τ(f) = 0.
Now f is a simple-homotopy equivalence if f is
homotopic to a composite K0 →K1 →K2 →· · · →Kn where each map
Ki →Ki+1 is either the inclusion map of an elementary expansion, the
deformation retraction of an elementary collapse, or a cellular homeomor-
phism. We analyze the pieces. A cellular homeomorphism clearly has trivial
torsion. If i : A →B is the inclusion map of an elementary collapse then
τ(i) = τ(C(i∗: C∗( ˜A) →C∗( ˜B))) which is τ(C∗( ˜B, ˜A)) by Lemma 11.30.
But C∗( ˜B, ˜A) is a elementary chain complex so has trivial torsion. Finally,
if d : B →A is the associated deformation retract, then
τ(d) = τ(d∗: C∗( ˜B) →C∗( ˜A))
= τ(d∗◦i∗) −τ(i∗)
additivity of torsion
= τ(IdC∗( ˜
A)) −τ(i∗)
homotopy invariance of torsion
= 0.
The composite K0 →K1 →K2 →· · · →Kn must have trivial torsion since
all the pieces do. Thus τ(f) = 0.
For the proof of Part 3, suppose that f : K →L is a cellular map between
ﬁnite complexes with trivial torsion.
Then f factors as K →M(f) →
L.
The second map is a collapse map and hence is a simple-homotopy
equivalence and has trivial torsion. By the additivity of torsion, τ(K →
M(f)) = 0, and it suﬃces to show that this map is a simple-homotopy
equivalence.
Recycling our notation, we will assume K is a subcomplex of L and
that the torsion of the inclusion map is trivial. The ﬁrst step in showing
that K →L is a simple-homotopy equivalence is cell-trading [7, 7.3]. If e
is a cell of L −K of minimal dimension (say k), one constructs a a simple-
homotopy equivalence L →L′ rel K so that L′ has one less k-cell than L,

11.4. Whitehead torsion for CW-complexes

one more (k + 1)-cell, and for i ̸= k, k + 1, the number of i-cells of L and
of L′ are the same. By a simple-homotopy equivalence h : L →L′ rel K,
we mean that K is a subcomplex of both L and L′ and that h restricted to
K is the identity. By continuing to trade, one reduces to proving that an
inclusion i : K →L with trivial torsion is a simple-homotopy equivalence
when the cells of L−K all are in two adjoining dimensions, say n and n+1.
Then the chain complex C(˜L, ˜K) is described by a matrix! We can stabilize
the matrix, if desired, by making expansions. Since the torsion is zero, we
may assume that the matrix is a product of elementary matrices. There
is a technique called cell-sliding [7, 8.3] (changing the attaching map of an
(n + 1)-cell) which gives a simple-homotopy equivalence L →L′ rel K so
that the matrix in the chain complex is replaced by the matrix multiplied
by an elementary matrix. Thus one reduces to the case where K →L has
the chain complex
C(˜L, ˜K) = {· · · →0 →Z[π]m
Id
−→Z[π]m →0 →· · · }
in which case there is one last technique, cell-cancellation [7, 8.2], which
says that K →L is a simple-homotopy equivalence.
Two ﬁnite CW-complexes are said to have the same simple-homotopy
type if there is a simple-homotopy equivalence between them. Homeomor-
phic CW-complexes could have drastically diﬀerent CW-structures. Do they
they have the same simple-homotopy type?
A fundamental theorem of
Chapman implies that simple-homotopy type is a homeomorphism invariant:
Theorem 11.32 (Chapman [6]). If f : X →Y is a homeomorphism be-
tween ﬁnite CW-complexes then f is a simple-homotopy equivalence.
It follows that the torsion of a homotopy equivalence f : X →Y between
ﬁnite CW-complexes depends only on the underlying topological spaces.
How does simple-homotopy theory apply to manifolds?
Typically, a
smooth manifold is given the structure of a simplicial complex (and hence a
CW-complex) by constructing a triangulation. This triangulation is unique
up to subdivision, and it is not diﬃcult to show [28] that the identity map
between a complex and a subdivision has trivial torsion.
Thus compact
smooth manifolds have a well-deﬁned simple-homotopy type. A deep theo-
rem of Kirby-Siebenmann shows that this theory also applies for topological
manifolds (Hausdorﬀspaces which are locally Euclidean). They show that
a compact topological manifold has a canonical simple-homotopy type.
In the next section we will deﬁne Reidemeister torsion for certain ﬁ-
nite CW-complexes. This will be an interesting and computable invariant

346
11. Simple-Homotopy Theory
of simple-homotopy type. If two manifolds have diﬀerent Reidemeister tor-
sions, by Chapman’s theorem they cannot be homeomorphic.
11.5. Reidemeister torsion
Suppose that (C, ∂) is a ﬁnite, based (with basis {bi}) chain complex, not
necessarily acyclic, over a ring S. Let f : S →R be a ring homomorphism.
Then (C ⊗S R, ∂⊗IdR) is a ﬁnite, based (with basis {bi ⊗1}) chain complex
over S.
If (C, ∂) is acyclic with chain contraction s, then (C ⊗S R, ∂⊗IdR) is
acyclic since it has the chain contraction s⊗IdR. The torsions are related
by
τ(C ⊗S R) = f∗τ(C)
where f∗: K1(S) →K1(R) is the induced homomorphism. However, in
many interesting cases it may happen that C ⊗S R is acyclic although C is
not, so that τ(C ⊗S R) may be deﬁned even though τ(C) is not.
Moreover, if R is a commutative ring, or better yet, a ﬁeld, then the
determinant deﬁnes a homomorphism (an isomorphism if R is a ﬁeld)
det : K1(R) →R×/ ± 1 (see Exercise 193).
Deﬁnition 11.33. Let C be a based chain complex over a ring S, and
f : S →R be a ring homomorphism to a commutative ring. Suppose that
C ⊗S R is acyclic. Then
∆R(C) = det(τ(C ⊗S R)) ∈R×/ ± 1
is called the Reidemeister torsion of C with respect to
f : S →R. Since
∆R(C) is a unit in R we use multiplicative notation for Reidemeister torsion.
Let X be a CW-complex. Let R be some ring, which for our purposes
may be taken to be commutative. Suppose
ρ : Zπ1X →R,
is a ring homomorphism. The chain complex
C∗( ˜X)⊗Zπ1XR
was used in Chapter 5 to deﬁne homology with twisted coeﬃcients H∗(X; R).
A choice of lifts and orientations of cells makes this a based (right) R-
complex. If it happens to be acyclic, then the torsion τ ∈K1(R) is deﬁned,
and so we can take the Reidemeister torsion
∆R(X) = ∆R(C∗(X)) ∈R×
to be the determinant of τ.
The following exercise shows how to remove the dependence of ∆R on
the choice of lifts, orientation, and ordering of cells.

11.5. Reidemeister torsion
347
Exercise 201. Let G ⊂R× be the subgroup generated by −1 and det(ρ(γ))
for γ ∈π1(X), where ρ : Zπ1X →R is the given ring homomorphism.
Show that the Reidemeister torsion ∆R(X), taken in R×/G, is well deﬁned,
independent of the choice of lifts, orientation, or ordering of cells.
We usually abuse notation and consider Reidemeister torsion as an ele-
ment of R×, and omit mentioning that it is only well-deﬁned up to multi-
plication by an element of G.
The disadvantage of Reidemeister torsion is that it requires a map ρ so
that C∗( ˜X) ⊗Zπ S is acyclic. Perhaps for a given X, no useful map exists.
The advantage is that when ρ does exist, the Reidemeister torsion gives an
invariant of the space. The following proposition is a corollary of Corollary
11.25.
Proposition 11.34. Let f : X →Y be a homotopy equivalence between
ﬁnite, connected CW-complexes. Let π = π1X = π1Y . Suppose ρ : Zπ →R
is a ring homomorphism to a commutative ring so that C∗( ˜X) ⊗Zπ R and
C∗( ˜Y ) ⊗Zπ R are acyclic. Then
ρ∗τ(f) = ∆R(Y ) −∆R(X) ∈R×/G.
Thus Reidemeister torsion is an invariant capable of distinguishing simple-
homotopy type for homotopy type, and of showing two homotopy equivalent
spaces are not homeomorphic. In the next section we apply this idea to lens
spaces.
Reidemeister torsion can also lead to interesting invariants, for example,
the Alexander polynomial of a knot.
Let K ⊂S3 be a knot, that is, a
smooth submanifold of S3 diﬀeomorphic to S1. Let X = S3 −N(K), where
N(K) is an open tubular neighborhood of K. Alexander duality implies
that H1(X) ∼= Z, and so every knot has a canonical (up to multiplication
by ±1) homomorphism a : π1X →H1X →Z.
Let R = Q(t), the ﬁeld of rational functions. Then deﬁne ρ : Zπ1X →
Q(t) by
ρ(

aγγ) =

aγta(γ).
It turns out (see the exercise below) that the chain complex
C = C∗( ˜X) ⊗Zπ1X Q(t)
is acyclic. Its Reidemeister torsion ∆Q(t)(X) is a nonzero rational function
and is well deﬁned up to sign and powers of t. Moreover ∆Q(t)(X) is always
of the form
∆Q(t)(X) = (t −1)/∆K(t)

348
11. Simple-Homotopy Theory
for some polynomial ∆K(t) ∈Z[t]. This polynomial is called the Alexander
polynomial of K. It is a useful invariant for distinguishing isotopy classes of
knots.
Exercise 202. Let µ ⊂X be a meridian of the knot K, that is, the bound-
ary circle of a small embedded disk in S3 intersecting K transversely in one
point. Show that the inclusion µ →S3 induces an isomorphism on integral
homology. Conclude that H∗(X, µ; Z) = 0 and so the cellular chain complex
C∗(X, µ) is acyclic.
Let s : C∗(X, µ) →C∗(X, µ) be a chain contraction. Lift s to a map
˜s : C∗( ˜X, ˜µ) ⊗Zπ1X Q(t) →C∗( ˜X, ˜µ) ⊗Zπ1X Q(t) and show that ˜s∂−∂˜s is
a chain isomorphism. Conclude that C∗( ˜X, ˜µ) ⊗Zπ1(X) Q(t) is acyclic. The
long exact sequence for the pair ( ˜X, ˜µ) then shows that C∗( ˜X) ⊗Zπ1X Q(t)
is acyclic.
11.6. Torsion and lens spaces
In this section we will use Reidemeister torsion to classify 3-dimensional
lens spaces up to simple-homotopy and prove Theorem 11.1. The homotopy
classiﬁcation diﬀers from the simple-homotopy classiﬁcation, but the simple-
homotopy classiﬁcation is the same as the homeomorphism classiﬁcation, the
diﬀeomorphism classiﬁcation, and the isometry classiﬁcation.
Let (p, q) be a pair of relatively prime integers, with p > 0. For con-
venience let r denote an inverse for q mod p, so rq ≡1 mod p. There are
many descriptions of L(p, q). We will give a description which makes the
cell structure on its universal cover easy to see.
Let X = S1×D2 be the solid torus, which we parameterize as the subset
{(z1, z2)| |z1| = 1, |z2| ≤1} ⊂C2. The quotient of X by the equivalence
relation (z1, z2) ∼(z′
1, z2) if |z2| = 1 is the 3-sphere S3. In fact the map
f : X →S3 deﬁned by
f(z1, z2) = (z1
'
1 −|z2|2, z2)
deﬁnes a homeomorphism from X/ ∼to S3 ⊂C2.
Write ζ = e2πi/p and let Z/p act on X by
(z1, z2) · g = (z1ζ, z2ζq)
where Z/p is written multiplicatively as ⟨g | gp = 1⟩(we use a right action to
be consistent with the previous sections). This deﬁnes the free Z/p-action
on S3 = X/ ∼
(w1, w2) · g = (w1ζ, w2ζq).
The map f : X →S3 is an equivariant map. By deﬁnition the quotient
space S3/(Z/p) is the lens space L(p, q).

11.6. Torsion and lens spaces
349
We use the description X/ ∼to construct an equivariant cell structure
on S3. Let ˜e0 be the image under f of the point (1, 1) ∈X. We take the
0-cells of S3 to be the p points ˜e0, ˜e0g, · · · , ˜e0gp−1. Notice that
˜e0gn = f((1, 1)gn) = f(ζn, ζqn) = f(1, ζqn).
Next, let ˜e1 be the image under f of the arc {(1, eiθ) | 0 ≤θ ≤2π
p }, and
take as 1-cells the translates ˜e1, ˜e1g, · · · , ˜e1gp−1. Then
∂˜e1 = f(1, ζ) −f(1, 1)
= f(1, ζqr) −f(1, 1)
= ˜e0(gr −1),
(11.4)
since qr ≡1 mod p.
Let ˜e2 be f(1 × D2).
We take as 2-cells the translates of ˜e2 by g,
˜e2, ˜e2g, · · · , ˜e2gp−1. Then
∂˜e2 = f({(1, eiθ) | 0 ≤θ ≤2π})
= ˜e1 + ˜e1g + · · · + ˜e1gp−1
= ˜e1(1 + g + · · · + gp−1).
(11.5)
For the 3-cells, consider the solid cylinder
[0, 2π
p ] × D2 ∼= {eiθ |θ ∈[0, 2π
p ]} × D2 ⊂X.
This is homeomorphic to a closed 3-ball. Its image in S3
f([0, 2π
p ] × D2) = ([0, 2π
p ] × D2)/ ∼
is a “lens”, also homeomorphic to a closed 3-ball.
[0, 2π
p ] × D2
f([0, 2π
p ] × D2)

350
11. Simple-Homotopy Theory
We let ˜e3 be the 3-cell f([0, 2π
p ] × D2). Then
∂˜e3 = f({ζ} × D2) −f({1} × D2)
= f({ζ} × (D2ζq)) −f({1} × D2)
= f(({1} × D2)ζ) −f({1} × D2)
= ˜e2(g −1).
(11.6)
Thus we have described a Z/p-equivariant cell structure for S3; this
deﬁnes a cell structure on L(p, q) with one 0-cell e0, one 1-cell e1, one 2-cell
e2, and one 3-cell e3. We calculated the Z[π]-chain complex for the universal
cover 
L(p, q) = S3 of L(p, q) to be
0 −→Zπ(˜e3)
∂3
−→Zπ(˜e2)
∂2
−→Zπ(˜e1)
∂1
−→Zπ(˜e0) −→0
(11.7)
with ∂3 = g −1, ∂2 = 1 + g + g2 + · · · + gp−1, and ∂1 = gr −1.
Notice that the map from the lens to L(p, q) is a quotient map which is
a homeomorphism on its interior. Therefore L(p, q) can be described as the
identiﬁcation space of the lens, where the left 2-disk in the boundary of the
lens is identiﬁed with the right 2-disk by a 2πq
p -twist.
Exercise 203. Draw a picture of this cell structure on S3 for p = 5 and
q = 2 by thinking of S3 as R3 −{∞}. Label the i-cells ˜ei, g˜ei, · · · , g4˜ei.
Exercise 204. Show that L(2, 1) is the real projective plane. Show that
L(p, q) is the union of two solid tori.
Since π1(L(p, q)) = Z/p, if L(p, q) is homotopy equivalent to L(p′, q′)
then p = p′. The following theorem gives the homotopy classiﬁcation of
3-dimensional lens spaces.
Theorem 11.35. Suppose f : L(p, q) →L(p, q′) takes g to (g′)a, where g, g′
are the generators of π1(L(p, q)), π1(L(p, q′)) as above. Assume (a, p) = 1,
so that f induces an isomorphism on fundamental groups. Then
1. q deg(f) ≡q′a2 mod p.
2. f is a homotopy equivalence if and only if deg(f) = ±1.
Moreover, if there exists an integer a so that a2q′ ≡±q mod p, then
there is a homotopy equivalence f : L(p, q) →L(p, q′) whose induced map
on fundamental groups takes g to (g′)a.
Proof. Let L = L(p, q), L′ = L(p, q′). First note that f∗: π1L →π1L′ is
an isomorphism since (a, p) = 1 implies (g′)a generates Z/p = π1L′. Using
the cellular approximation theorem and the homotopy extension property,
we may assume that f is cellular. Denote the the cells of L′ by e′.

11.6. Torsion and lens spaces
351
Recall that the group of covering transformations of a universal cover
p : ˜X →X is identiﬁed with the fundamental group of X by taking the
covering transformation h : ˜X →˜X to the loop p(α), where α is a path in
˜X from ˜x0 to h(˜x0). Since ˜e1 is a path in S3 from ˜e1 to ˜e1gr by (11.4), e1
(which is a loop since there is only one 0-cell in L) represents gr in π1L.
Similarly e′
1 represents (g′)r′ in π1L′.
Because f is cellular and takes g to (g′)a on fundamental groups, it
follows that the loop f(e1) represents (g′)ar = (g′)r′q′ar, and so the chain
map f∗: C1(L) →C1(L′) takes e1 to (q′ar)e′
1.
Lift f to ˜f : ˜L →˜L′, so that ˜f(˜e0) = ˜e′
0. Then since f(e1) wraps q′ar
times around e′
1, f(˜e1) lifts to a sum of q′ar translates of ˜e′
1. Precisely,
˜f(˜e1) = ˜e′
1 + ˜e′
1(g′)r′ + · · · + ˜e′
1(g′)r′(q′ar−1)
= ˜e′
1(1 + (g′)r′ + · · · + (g′)r′(q′ar−1)).
(11.8)
To avoid being confused by isomorphic rings, write
Λ = Z[Z/p] = Z[t]/(tp −1).
Identify Z[π1L] with Λ using the isomorphism determined by g →ta, and
identify Z[π1L′] with Λ via g′ →t. With these identiﬁcations, the equivari-
ant chain complexes of 

where the diﬀerentials in two chain complexes are given by multiplication
by an element in Λ as follows.

identiﬁcations of Λ with Z[π1L] and Z[π1L′].

352
11. Simple-Homotopy Theory
Since ˜f(˜e0) = ˜e′
0 and f takes g to (g′)a, it follows that f0 =Id. From
Equation (11.8) we conclude that
f1 = 1 + tr′ + · · · + tr′(q′ar−1).
Now f1∂2 = ∂′
2f2, i.e. (1 + t + · · · + tp−1)f1 = (1 + t + · · · + tp−1)f2. This
implies that
f2 = f1 + ξ(1 −t) for some ξ ∈Λ.
(11.9)
Similarly we have that f2∂3 = ∂′
3f3 i.e.
f2(ta −1) = (t −1)f3, and
therefore (t −1)(ta−1 + · · · + 1)f2 = (t −1)f3. Hence
f3 = (ta−1 + · · · + 1)f2 + β(1 + t + · · · + tp−1) for some β ∈Λ.
(11.10)
Let ε : Λ →Z be the augmentation map deﬁned by map  niti → ni.
Then H3 ˜L = ker ∂3 = span(1 + t + · · · + tp−1) ∼= Z. The isomorphism is
given by
(1 + t + · · · + tp−1) · α →ε(α).
(Check that this indeed gives an isomorphism. Facts like this come from the
identity (1 + t + · · · + tp−1)(1 −t) = 0 in Z[Z/p].)
Similarly
H3 ˜L′ ∼= ker ∂′
3 = span(1 + t + · · · + tp−1) ∼= Z.
Thus, deg ˜f = n if and only if f3(1+t+· · ·+tp−1) = n(1+t+· · ·+tp−1).
Now
f3(1 + t + · · · + tp−1) = ε(f3)(1 + t + · · · + tp−1)
and, using the computations above,
ε(f3)
=
ε((ta−1 + t + · · · + 1)f2 + β · (1 + t + · · · + tp−1))
=
aε(f2) + ε(β) · p
=
aε(f1 + ξ(1 −t)) + ε(β) · p
=
aε(f1) + ε(β) · p
=
a · q′ar + ε(β) · p.
In these equations, ξ and β are the elements deﬁned in Equations 11.9 and
11.10. Thus the degree of ˜f equals a2 · q′r + ε(β) · p and in particular the
degree of ˜f is congruent to a2q′r mod p.
The covers ˜L →L, ˜L′ →L′ both have degree p.
Since the degree
multiplies under composition of maps between oriented manifolds, it follows
that p deg f = p deg ˜f, and so deg f = deg ˜f = a2q′r + ε(β)p, proving the
second assertion.

11.6. Torsion and lens spaces
353
If deg f = deg ˜f = ±1, then since ˜L ∼= S3 ∼= ˜L′, the map ˜f : S3 →S3
is a homotopy equivalence. Thus f : L →L′ induces an isomorphism on
all homotopy groups and is therefore a homotopy equivalence by Theorem
6.71.
It remains to prove 3. Deﬁne a map on the 1 skeleton f(1) : L(1) →L′
so that the induced map on fundamental groups takes g to (g′)a.
Since
((g′)a)p = 1, f(1) extends over the 2 skeleton. The obstruction to extending
over the 3-skeleton lies in H3(L; π2L′). Notice that π1L′ acts trivially on
πkL′ for all k, since the covering transformations S3 →S3 have degree 1
and so are homotopic to the identity. Thus the results of obstruction theory
(Chapter 7) apply in this situation.
Since π2L′ = π2S3 = 0, H3(L; π2L′) = 0 and so this obstruction van-
ishes. Hence we can extend over the 3-skeleton; since this does not alter the
map on the 1-skeleton we obtain a map f : L →L′ so that f∗(g) = (g′)a.
If a2q′r ≡±1 mod p, then ˜f has a degree ±1 mod p. We assert that f
can be modiﬁed so that the resulting lift ˜f is replaced by another equivariant
map ˜f′ such that deg ˜f′ = deg ˜f ± p. This is a formal consequence of the
technique used to extend f over the 3-skeleton in obstruction theory; we
outline the construction in this speciﬁc case.
Let x ∈L, and redeﬁne f on a neighborhood of x as indicated in the
following ﬁgure.
x

collapse
f ∨h
L
L ∨S3
Here h : S3 →L′ is a degree ±p map (e.g.
take h to be the universal
covering). Denote by f′ this composition of the collapsing map L →L ∨S3
and f ∨h. There are many ways to see that the degree of f′ equals the
deg(f) ± p. Notice that since f is only modiﬁed on a 3-cell, f and f′ induce
the same map on fundamental groups.
If a2q′r ≡±1 mod p, then repeating this modiﬁcation as needed we
can arrange that deg f = ±1, and so f is a homotopy equivalence. This
completes the proof of Theorem 11.35.

11. Simple-Homotopy Theory
Exercise 205.
1. Show that L(5, 1) and L(5, 2) have the same homotopy and homology
groups, but are not homotopy equivalent.
2. Show that L(7, 1) and L(7, 2) are homotopy equivalent. Show that
any homotopy equivalence is orientation preserving, i.e. has degree
1. Is this true for any pair of homotopy equivalent lens spaces?
Having completed the homotopy classiﬁcation, we turn now to the simple-
homotopy classiﬁcation. This is accomplished using Reidemeister torsion.
The chain complex of the universal covers of a lens space L = L(p, q) is
not acyclic, since it has the homology of S3. We will tensor with C to turn
them into acyclic complexes and compute the corresponding Reidemeister
torsion. Thus we need a ring map Z[Z/p] →C.
Let ζ = e2πi/p ∈C. Let ρ : Z[Z/p] →C be the ring homomorphism
deﬁned by
h(t) = ζ.
Note that h(1 + t + · · · + tp−1) = 0, and that if p̸ | a, then ζa ̸= 1.
In this notation we assumed Z/p had the generator t. Let g be the gen-
erator of π1L, and chose an isomorphism π1L ∼= Z/p so that g corresponds
to ta where (a, p) = 1. Let D∗= C∗(˜L)⊗π1LC. This is a based complex over
the complex numbers with basis of the form e ⊗1 where e is an (oriented)
cell of L. Since L has one cell in each dimension d = 0, 1, 2, 3,
Dn =

C
if n = 0, 1, 2, 3,

otherwise.
Moreover, from the chain complex (11.7) one easily sees that
D∗= { 0

and so the Reidemeister torsion is
∆C(L) = (ζa −1)(ζar −1)
(recall that we are using multiplicative notation). Notice that the Reide-
meister torsion takes its values in C×/ ± {1, ζ, · · · , ζp−1}.

11.6. Torsion and lens spaces
355
Now suppose f : L(p, q) →L(p, q′) is a homotopy equivalence which
takes g to (g′)a for some a so that (a, p) = 1. Then if we choose the isomor-
phism π1L′ ∼= Z/p so that g′ corresponds to t, we have
∆C(L′) = (ζ −1)(ζr′ −1).
If f is a simple-homotopy equivalence, τ(f) = 0.
so by Proposition
11.34, ∆C(L) and ∆C(L′) are equal in the quotient C×/ ± {1, ζ, · · · , ζp−1}.
We summarize this conclusion (and the conclusion of Theorem 11.35 for
convenience) in the following proposition.
Proposition 11.36. If f : L(p, q) →L(p, q′) is a simple-homotopy equiva-
lence which takes the generator g ∈π1L to (g′)a ∈π1L′, then
1. a2q′ ≡±q mod p.
2. For each pth root of unity ζ ̸= 1, there exists an s ∈Z/p so that
(ζa −1)(ζar −1) = ±ζs(ζ −1)(ζr′ −1)
where r and r′ are determined by the equations rq ≡1 mod p and
r′q′ ≡1 mod p.
Example of L(7,1) and L(7,2).
Let L(7, 1) = L and L(7, 2) = L′. Then
the equation a2 = ±2 mod 7 has only the solutions a = 3, a = 4. We have
r = 1 and r′ = 4.
Exercise 205 shows that L and L′ are homotopy equivalent. Suppose
that L and L′ were simple-homotopy equivalent.
1. If a = 3, then for each seventh root of unity ζ there exists an s ∈Z
with
(ζ3 −1)2 = ±ζs(ζ −1)(ζ4 −1).
This implies that
|ζ3 −1|2 = |ζ −1||ζ4 −1|.
Note that |ζ3 −1| = |ζ4 −1|. But we leave it to you as an exercise to
show |ζb −1| = 2 cos(bπ/p), and we will allow the use of a calculator
to show |ζ −1| ̸= |ζ3 −1|.
2. If a = 4 the equation reads:
(ζ4 −1)2 = ±ζs(ζ −1)(ζ4 −1).
For similar reasons as in the ﬁrst case this is impossible.
Thus L(7, 1) is homotopy equivalent but not simple-homotopy equiv-
alent to L(7, 2).
Theorem 11.32 implies that L(7, 1) and L(7, 2) are not
homeomorphic.

11. Simple-Homotopy Theory
We will now give the simple-homotopy classiﬁcation for 3-dimensional
lens spaces. The proof will rely on a number-theoretic result about roots of
unity.
Theorem 11.37. If f : L(p, q) →L(p, q′) is a simple-homotopy equiva-
lence, with f∗(g) = (g′)a, then L(p, q) is homeomorphic to L(p, q′) and either
a = ±1 and q ≡±q′mod p
or
a = ±q and q ≡±(q′)−1mod p.
In particular, q ≡±(q′)−1mod p.
Proof. Suppose that f : L(p, q) →L(p, q′) is a simple-homotopy equiva-
lence. Proposition 11.36 shows that for any pth root of unity ζ ̸= 1 there
exists an s with
(ζa −1)(ζar −1) = ±ζs(ζ −1)(ζr′ −1).
Note that |ζs|2 = 1 and for any x, |ζx −1|2 = (ζx −1)(ζ−x −1). Thus
1 = (ζa −1)(ζ−a −1)(ζar −1)(ζ−ar −1)(ζ −1)(ζ−1 −1)(ζr′ −1)(ζ−r′ −1).
For each j so that 0 < j < p and (j, p) = 1 deﬁne
mj = #{x ∈{a, −a, ar, −ar}|x ≡j mod p}
and
nj = #{x ∈{1, −1, r′, −r′}|x ≡j mod p}.
Then clearly 
j mj = 4 = 
j nj.
Let aj = mj −nj. Then
(a)  aj = 0.
(b) aj = mj −nj = mp−j −np−j = ap−j.
(c) 
j(ζj −1)aj = 1.
A theorem of Franz (for a proof see [19]) says that if aj is a sequence of
integers so that (a), (b), and (c) hold for all pth roots of unity ζ ̸= 1, then
aj = 0 for all j.
Thus mj = nj for each j. It follows that either
1. a ≡ε1 and ar ≡ε2r′ mod p for some εi ∈{±1}, or,
2. a ≡ε1r′ and ar ≡ε2 mod p for some εi ∈{±1}.
The ﬁrst part of the theorem follows from this and the facts that rq ≡1
mod p and r′q′ ≡1 mod p.
The homeomorphism h : S3 →S3 taking (w1, w2) to (w1, ¯w2) is equi-
variant with respect to the actions (w1, w2)g = (w1ζ, w2ζq) and (w1, w2)g =
(w1ζ, w2ζ−q). This implies that L(p, q) and L(p, −q) are homeomorphic.

11.7. The s-cobordism theorem
357
The homeomorphism k : S3 →S3 taking (w1, w2) to (w2, w1) is equi-
variant with respect to the actions (w1, w2)g = (w1ζ, w2ζq) and (w1, w2)g =
(w1ζq, w2ζ). The quotient space of the Z/p action (w1, w2)g = (w1ζq, w2ζ)
is the same as the quotient space the Z/p action (w1, w2)g = (w1ζ, w2ζr),
since p and q are relatively prime and (w1ζq, w2ζ) = (w1ζq, w2(ζq)r). This
implies that L(p, q) and L(p, r) are homeomorphic (where r = q−1 mod
p). Thus if L(p, q) and L(p, q′) are simple-homotopy equivalent they are
homeomorphic.
Proof of Theorem 11.1. The homotopy classiﬁcation was obtained in
Theorem 11.35. Theorem 11.37 shows that if q′ = ±q±1 then L(p, q) and
L(p, q′) are homeomorphic.
If q′ ̸= ±q±1 then L(p, q) and L(p, q′) are not simple-homotopy equiv-
alent, and so by Chapman’s theorem (Theorem 11.32) L(p, q) and L(p, q′)
are not homeomorphic.
11.7. The s-cobordism theorem
Finally, we end this chapter with the statement of the s-cobordism theorem,
a fundamental result of geometric topology.
Theorem 11.38 (s-cobordism theorem). Let W be a smooth {respectively
piecewise-linear, topological} compact manifold of dimension 6 or more whose
boundary consists of two path components M0 and M1. Suppose that the in-
clusions M0 →W and M1 →W are homotopy equivalences. Let τ(W, M0) ∈
Wh(π) denote the Whitehead torsion of the acyclic, based Z[π1W]–complex
C∗( ˜W, ˜
M0).
Then W is diﬀeomorphic {respectively PL-homeomorphic, homeomor-
phic} to M0 × [0, 1] if and only τ(W, M0) = 0 vanishes.
A good exposition of the proof in the smooth case is given in [18] and
in the PL-case in [34]. The topological case is much harder and is based on
the breakthroughs of Kirby and Siebenmann [20] for topological manifolds.
The theorem is false in the smooth case if W has dimension 5 even by results
of Donaldson [9], and is true in the topological case in dimension 5 for many
fundamental groups (e.g. π1W ﬁnite) by work of Freedman-Quinn [11].
The method is of proof of the s-cobordism theorem is to develop han-
dlebody structures on manifolds. A handlebody structure is an enhanced
analogue of a CW-decomposition. Provided the dimension of the manifold
is high enough, then handles can be manipulated in a manner similar to the
way cells are manipulated in the proof of Theorem 11.31, and the proof of

358
11. Simple-Homotopy Theory
the s-cobordism theorem proceeds using handle-trading, handle-sliding, and
handle-cancellation.
11.8. Projects for Chapter 11
11.8.1. Handlebody theory and torsion for manifolds. Discuss han-
dlebody theory for smooth (or PL) manifolds and use it to indicate how tor-
sion can be useful in the study of diﬀeomorphism (or PL homeomorphism)
problems for manifolds. In particular, discuss how handlebody structures
relate Theorems 11.31 and 11.38.

pg. 3, Deﬁnitions 1.2 and 1.3. The deﬁnition of cells, attaching cells, and CW complexes
can be clariﬁed as follows.
First, if X is a topological space, A a closed subspace, then say that X is obtained from
A by attaching n-cells {en
i }i∈I if there exist maps φn
i : (Dn, Sn−1) →(X, A) so that the
function from the disjoint union i ⨿φn
i : A ⨿i∈I Dn
i →X is a quotient map determined by
the restrictions of the φn
i to Sn−1.
Precisely, the disjoint union A ⨿i∈I Dn
i is topologized by declaring a set to be closed
if its intersection with A and each disk Dn
i is closed. An equivalence relation is given by
declaring points x ̸= y in A ⨿i∈I Dn
i to be in the same equivalence class if either x ∈Sn−1
i
and y ∈Sn−1
j
and φn
i (x) = φn
j (y) for some i, j (allowing i = j) or if x ∈Sn−1
i
, y ∈A and
φn
i (x) = y for some i, or if y ∈Sn−1
i
, x ∈A and φn
i (y) = x. This equivalence relation
deﬁnes a quotient space A ⨿i∈I Dn
i / ∼and a bijective map to X which is required to be a
homeomorphism.
The cells of X rel A are the images en
i of the interiors of the disks Dn
i via φn
i .
In
particular, X is the disjoint union (set-theoretically) of A and the cells of X rel A.
Similarly, a relative CW complex (X, A) is a topological space and a closed subspace A
endowed with a ﬁltration
A = X−1 ⊂X0 ⊂X1 · · · ⊂Xn ⊂· · · ⊂X
so that X = ∪nXn. The ﬁltration satisﬁes the conditions that X0 is the disjoint union of A
with a discrete space, Xn is obtained from Xn−1 by attaching n-cells, and the topology on
X satisﬁes the requirement that a subset B ⊂X is closed if and only if B ∩Xn is closed for
all n. Then X is (set theoretically) the disjoint union of A and the cells en
i = φn
i (Int(Dn
i )).

H0(C∗) = 0.

pg. 49. The deﬁnition of a free functor F : A →C is not complete. The precise deﬁnition is
as follows. For each q ∈Z one is given an indexed set {bj ∈Fq(Mj)}j∈J where Mj ∈M such
that for every X ∈A, Fq(X) is a free R module with basis {Fq(u)(bj) | u ∈HomA(Mj, X)}.
pg. 53. If C∗and D∗are free chain complexes, the splitting in the Ku¨nneth exact sequence
is obtained just like the splitting in the Universal Coeﬃcient Theorem. If D∗is not free, then
reasoning is more complicated and involves ﬁnding a chain homotopy equivalence D′

where D′
∗is a free chain complex. For details, see the discussion in A Course in Homological
Algebra, by Hilton and Stammbach.

The proof that 1 ∪α = α is wrong.
Instead, ﬁrst extend 1 ∈S0(X) to act
on all chains by declaring 1(z) = 0 if z ∈Sp(X) with p > 0.
Then deﬁne a natural
transformation C : S∗(X) →S∗(X) as the composite of a diagonal approximation τ :
S∗(X) →S∗(X) ⊗S∗(X) and the map E : S∗(X) →S∗(X) given by E(z ⊗w) = 1(z)w.
The map E is easily checked to be a natural chain map, and hence C is a natural chain map.
By the uniqueness part of the acyclic models theorem, C is chain homotopic to the identity.
If α ∈S∗(X), E∗(α)(z ⊗w) = α(E(z ⊗w)) = α(1(z)w) = 1(z)α(w) = (1 ×alg α)(z ⊗w).
Therefore, C∗(α) = τ ∗(E∗(α)) = τ ∗(1 ×alg α) = 1 ∪α. Passing to cohomology and using
the fact that C is chain homotopic to the identity gives 1 ∪α = α.

Solving Exercise 48 requires knowing that the homology groups of a
compact manifold are ﬁnitely generated abelian groups.
This can be shown by proving
that any manifold embeds in RN for some N in such a way that it is a retract of a ﬁnite
subcomplex of RN.
Morse theory gives an easy proof that a smooth compact manifold
admits a CW structure with ﬁnitely many cells.
pg.

i.e. ϵ =

pg, 80, line 1. That a locally trivial bundle is the same thing as a ﬁber bundle with
structure group Homeo(F) depends on what topology one uses on Homeo(F), since with
our deﬁnition we require the transition functions U →G to be continuous. One (unsatisfac-
tory) solution is to give Homeo(F) the indiscrete topology. A better solution would be to
topologize Homeo(F) so that a map X →Homeo(F) is continuous if and only if the adjoint
map X × F →F is continuous. Often, but not always, this condition is satisﬁed by the
compact open topology.

Aut(A) is an anti-homomorphism, which can be turned into a homomorphism by composing
with the map Aut(A) →Aut(A) given by f 7→f −1.” See the comment below concerning
page 97.
pg, 90, line -7. Change “p−1(U ′)” to “(p′)−1(U ′).”
pg. 97, line 29, and Deﬁnition 4.3, pg 84. The π1(X, x0)-action on the universal cover
p : ˜X →X and the ﬁber p−1(x0) is usually deﬁned (e.g. in Massey’s book) as follows.
3

First, if α and β are paths with α(1) = β(0), then αβ means the composite where one
ﬁrst follows α, then β.
Next, if x ∈p−1(x0) and α ∈π1(X, x0), then one usually deﬁnes x · α to be the endpoint
of the unique lift of α to ˜X starting at x. Then for α, β ∈π1(X, x0), x · (αβ) = (x · α) · β,
so that π1(X, x0) acts on p−1(x0) on the right.
Finally, if one chooses a basepoint ˜x0 ∈p−1(x0) for ˜X, then given x ∈˜X and α ∈
π1(X, x0), one usually deﬁnes α · x to be the endpoint of the unique lift of p(γx) starting at
˜x0 · α, where γx is a path in ˜X starting at ˜x0 and ending at x. Then (αβ) · x = α · (β · x).
Thus π1(X, x0) acts on ˜X on the left. Hence with this deﬁnition, π1(X, x0) acts on the
singular chain complex S∗( ˜X) on the left.
An alternative way to describe these actions is to take the construction of ˜X as the space
of homotopy rel endpoint classes of paths in X starting at x0, with p : ˜X →X the endpoint
map. Then if γ is such a path and α ∈π1(X, x0), α · γ is just the composite αγ. Also,
p−1(x0) is the homotopy classes of loops (i.e. p−1(x0) = π1(X, x0)). If γ ∈p−1(x0) then
γ · α = γα.
On the other hand, it is usual (e.g. Steenrod’s book) to consider a principal G-bundle
P →B to be a ﬁber bundle with ﬁber G and structure group G action on G by left
translation, as we do in Deﬁnition 4.3 on page 84. Thus G acts on the ﬁber on the left and
on the total space X on the right.
Hence, the conventions are inconsistent if one wishes to consider the universal cover (or
more generally a regular cover) as a principal G-bundle.
In the book we assert that π1(X, x0) acts on ˜X on the right. Thus we use a convention
which is oposite from the usual one described above. This can be done cheaply by starting
with the left action and converting it to a right action by deﬁning x · α := α−1 · x, or
equivalently by modifying the geometric construction (e.g.
let ˜X be the homotopy rel
endpoint classes of paths in X ending at x0). Then the universal cover becomes a principal
π1(X, x0)-bundle.

pg. 127, 138 and the proof of Theorem 6.39 part 1, pg. 138. The following result
is needed to justify the the notion of “the” ﬁber of a map.
Proposition.
Let p : E →B and p′ : E′ →B be ﬁbrations and suppose there exists a
homotopy equivalence h : E →E′ so that p′h is homotopic to p. Then p and p′ are ﬁber
homotopy equivalent. In particular the ﬁbers of p and p′ are homotopy equivalent.
A simple consequence of this fact is that if one turns a map into a ﬁbration in two diﬀerent
ways, then the resulting ﬁbrations are ﬁber homotopy equivalent. This is needed to justify
the last step of the proof of Theorem 6.39. The commutative triangle on pg. 140 shows
that the inclusion F →E can be replaced by the ﬁbration (Pf)0 →E with homotopy ﬁber
Ωb0B. But this is not the same ﬁbration as Pi →E in Theorem 6.18 starting with the
inclusion map i : F ⊂E. The proposition shows that if the ﬁber of some ﬁbration replacing
i : F ⊂E is Ωb0B, then the ﬁber of every ﬁbration replacing i : F ⊂B has the homotopy
type of Ωb0B.
5

Proof. (due to Dold) First, we may assume that p′h = p by using the homotopy lifting
property (HLP) for p′: just lift a homotopy from p′h to p starting at h. Its other endpoint
is a map ˆh homotopic to h satisfying p′ˆh = p. Since h and ˆh are homotopic, ˆh is also a
homotopy equivalence.
So assume p′h = p and let h′ : E′ →E be a homotopy inverse for h. Let F : E′ ×[0, 1] →
E′ be a homotopy between hh′ and IdE′. Let ¯G = p′F, so ¯G : E′ × [0, 1] →B. Since
¯G(e′, 0) = p′(F(e′, 0)) = p′(h(h′(e′))) = p(h′(e′)), the HLP for p implies that there is a lift
G : E′ × [0, 1] →E of ¯G with G(e′, 0) = h′(e′). Then p(G(e′, 1)) = ¯G(e′, 1) = p′(F(e′, 1)) =
p′(e′). In other words, if we deﬁne h′′ : E′ →E to be G(−, 1), i.e. h′′(e′) = G(e′, 1), then
h′′ is a homotopy inverse for h which preserves ﬁbers, i.e. ph′′ = p′. We will show that h′′
is a ﬁber homotopy inverse of h.
Given a homotopies R, S : X × [0, 1] →Y let R−1 denote the reverse homotopy, i.e.
R−1(x, t) = R(x, 1 −t) and let R ∗S denote the composite homotopy (assuming R(x, 1) =
S(x, 0))
R ∗S(x, t) =
(
R(x, 2t)
if t ≤1/2,
S(x, 2t −1)
if t ≥1/2.
Let H : E′ × [0, 1] →E′ be the composite H = (hG)−1 ∗F, which is deﬁned since
hG(e′, 0) = hh′(e′) = F(0). Thus H is a homotopy from hh′′ to IdE′. Since p′F = ¯G =
pG = p′hG, p′H(e′, t) = p′H(e′, 1 −t). In other words, viewing p′H as a loop [0, 1] →
Map(E′, B), this loop is obtained by traveling along a path and then returning along the
same path. There is an obvious nullhomotopy obtained by traveling less and less along the
path and returning. Precisely, deﬁne ¯K : E′ × [0, 1] × [0, 1] by
¯K(e′, t, s) =
(
p′H(e′, (1 −s)t)
if t ≤1/2,
p′H(e′, (1 −s)(1 −t))
if t ≥1/2.
Then ¯K(e′, t, 0) = p′H(e′, t), ¯K(e′, t, 1) = p′(e′), ¯K(e′, 0, s) = p′(e′), and ¯K(e′, 1, s) = p′(e′).
We will use the HLP to lift ¯K to a ﬁber preserving homotopy using an argument similar
to the argument on the bottom of page 118. Let U ⊂I × I be the union of the three sides
U = {(t, s) | s = 0 } ∪{(t, s) | t = 0 } ∪{(t, s) | t = 1 }.
Let K : E′ × U →E′ be the map
K(e′, t, s) =





H(e′, t)
if s = 0,
h(h′′(e′))
if t = 0,
e′
if t = 1.
Since there is a homeomorphism I × I ∼= I × I taking U to I × {0} = {(t, s) | s = 0 },
the HLP implies that K extends to a map K : E′ × I × I →E′ satisfying p′K = ¯K.
Let D : E′ × I →E′ be the endpoint of this map, i.e.
D(e′, t) = K(e′, t, 1).
Then
D(e′, 0) = h(h′′(e′)), D(e′, 1) = e′, and p′(D(e′, t)) = ¯K(e′, t, 1) = p′(e′). In other words, D
is a ﬁber preserving homotopy between hh′′ and IdE′.
Now repeat the entire argument to h′′ to ﬁnd a map h′′′ : E →E′ and ﬁber preserving
homotopy between h′′h′′′ and IdE. Use the notation “∼F ” for ﬁber preserving homotopic.
Then
h′′h ∼F h′′hh′′h′′′ ∼F h′′h′′′ ∼F IdE.
In other words h : E →E′ and h′′ : E′ →E are ﬁber homotopy inverses.

pg. 295, ﬁrst paragraph. All occurences of the digit “8” should be changed to a “9” in
this paragraph. Thus the paragraph should read as follows.
Let y ∈H5(SX) denote the non-zero element.
Suppose to the contrary that Sh is
nullhomotopic. Then SX is homotopy equivalent to the wedge S5 ∨S9. In particular the
map Sq4 : H5(SX) →H9(SX) is trivial, since if y is the non-zero element of H5(S5 ∨S9),
then y is pulled back from H5(S5) via the projection S5 ∨S9 →S5, but H9(S5) = 0 and
so by naturality Sq4(y) = 0.

Equivalently we will ﬁnd a chain map t : C′′ →C
which splits p. Let δ′′ be a chain contraction for C′′. Let σ : C′′ →C be a sequence of
homomorphisms σk : C′′
k →Ck which split Ck →C′′
k . Finally let t = ∂σδ′′ + σδ′′∂′′. Note
that ∂t = ∂σδ′′∂′′ = t∂′′, so t is a chain map. Note pt = p∂σδ′′ + δ′′∂′′ = ∂′′pσδ′′ + δ′′∂′′ =
∂′′δ′′ + δ′′∂′′ = IdC′′, so p splits t.
