An example of a practical problem
Increasingly, publishers are exploring ways to tag 
scientific literature in ways designed to make their 
contents more easily accessible to computers
For maximal effect, a single set of terms should be 
used for tagging all literature published in a given 
domain
How do we select the set of terms (‘ontology’) for 
each domain?

Most successful ontology venture thus far
$100 mill. invested in literature and database 
curation using the Gene Ontology (GO)
over 11 million annotations relating gene 
products (proteins) described in the UniProt, 
Ensembl and other databases to terms in the 
GO
20
GO provides a controlled system of 
representations for use in annotating 
data and literature that is
• multi-species
lti di
i li
• multi-disciplinary
• multi-granularity, from molecules 
to population
21
22
are structured representations of 
the domains of molecules, cells, 
diseases ... which can be used by 
The GO and its sister ontologies
researchers in many different 
disciplines who are focused on 
one and the same biological 
reality
23
The goal: virtual science
• consistent (non-redundant) annotation
• cumulative (additive) annotation
yielding, by incremental steps, a virtual 
map of the entirety of reality that is
map of the entirety of reality that is 
accessible to computational reasoning
24

This goal is realizable if we have a 
common ontology framework
data is retrievable
data is comparable
data is integratable
only to the degree that it is annotated 
using a common controlled vocabulary 
– compare the role of seconds, 
meters, kilograms … in unifying 
science
25
To achieve this end we have to engage 
in something like philosophy
is this the right way to organize the top level of this 
portion of the GO?
how does the top level of this ontology relate to 
the top levels of other, neighboring ontologies?
26
Aristotle’s Metaphysics
The world is organized via 
types/universals/categories which are 
hierarchically organized
27
This holds, too, of the biological world

Question: Why are species-

represent the world for purposes 
of reasoning?
Answer: They capture the way the 
world is (Aristotelian realism)

Aristotle’s Metaphysics is focused on 
objects (things, substances, organisms) 
The most important universals in his 
ontology are substance universals
cow  man  rock  planet
which pertain to what a thing is at all 
times at which it exists
45
For Aristotle, the world 
contains also accidents
which pertain to how a thing is at 
some time at which it exists:
= what holds of a substance per accidens
red  hot  suntanned  spinning
46
Accidents, too, instantiate 
genera and species
Thus accidents, too, form trees of 
greater and lesser generality

Places
For Aristotle the place of a substance is 
the interior boundary of the surrounding 
body 
(for example the interior boundary of the 
surrounding water where it meets a fish’s 
skin)
For holes, we need an extension of 
Aristotle’s metaphysics
65
A hole in the ground
Solid physical boundaries at the floor 
and walls
but with a lid that is not made of matter:

66

Holes involve two kinds of 
boundaries
bona fide boundaries which exist 
independently of our demarcating acts
fiat boundaries which exist only because 
we put them there
67
Examples
of bona fide boundaries:
an animal’s skin, the surface of the planet
of fiat boundaries:
the boundaries of postal districts and census 
tracts

with a fiat base:

How do those parts and dimensions of 
reality which we encounter in our everyday 
experience relate to those parts and 
dimensions of reality which are studied by
dimensions of reality which are studied by 
science?

Kantian Constructivism
There are no species-genus hierarchies in 
reality unless we put them there
The world – insofar as it is accessible to 
us through our concepts at all – is a closed 
system tailored by us to fit those concepts

Kantianism seems to work 
very well for the closed worlds 
of database environments

appropriate

genders, then the world represented in

hard vs. soft categories
Kantianism: we constitute/shape 
(empirical) reality in such a way that it 
corresponds to our categories
Aristotelianism: reality in itself is 
messy, but our categories fit 
nonetheless
99
For Aristotelians
when we apply general terms to reality we 
are aware that we may have to deal with 
an opposition

prototypical instances of the 
corresponding universals

Aristotle 2010
you seek to find a finer grained partition 
which will recognize the phenomenon in 
question and allow an explanation of 
why it deviates from the prototype
107
The advance of science
is not an advance away from Aristotle 
towards something better.
Provided Aristotle is interpreted aright it
Provided Aristotle is interpreted aright, it 
is a rigorous demonstration of the 
correctness of his ontological approach
108

Kantianism
each partition gives only a partial view (no 
complete map) of any reality beyond
and thus it gives a distorted view
– we can only really know what we 
ourselves have constructed
109
For the Aristotelian, there are 
two sorts of partitions:
those which relate merely to a created, 
surrogate world (Library of Congress 
Catalog)
those which are transparent to some 
independent reality beyond (Gene 
Ontology)
110
Concepts vs. categories
on the Kantian reading species are 
concepts, which we bring to reality
on the Aristotelian reading the world itself
on the Aristotelian reading the world itself
exhibits a species-genus structure 
independently of how we conceive it and 
we do our best to map this structure in our 
representations

Fantology
The doctrine, usually tacit, according to 
which ‘Fa’ (or ‘Rab’) is the key to the  
ontological structure of reality
The syntax of first-order predicate logic is 
123
a mirror of reality (a Leibnizian universal 
characteristic)
(Fantology a special case of linguistic 
Kantianism: the structure of language is 
they key to the structure of [knowable] 
reality)

First mistake of fantology:
All form is logical form

Semantic background of fantology
‘F’ stands for a property
‘a’ stands for an individual
properties belong to something like the
127
properties belong to something like the 
Platonic realm of forms
or
properties are sets of those individuals a 
for which F(a) is true

ontology 
This language reflects the structure of 
reality

128
The fantologist sees reality as being made 
up of atoms plus abstract (1- and n-place) 
‘properties’ or ‘attributes’
Fantology
Fa
All generality belongs to the predicate ‘F’
‘a’ is a mere name
129
Contrast this with the way scientists use names:
DNA-binding requirement of the yeast protein 
Rap1p as selected in silico from ribosomal 
protein gene promoter sequences 
For extreme fantologists ‘a’ leaves no room 
for ontological complexity
From the fact that predicate logic can (by 
assumption) be used to represent reality
It follows that: reality is made of atoms
130
It follows that: reality is made of atoms
(See Wittgenstein, Tractatus Logico-
Philosophicus)
For extreme fantologists ‘a’ leaves no room 
for ontological complexity
From this it follows:
that fantology cannot do justice to the 
existence of different levels of granularity of
131
existence of different levels of granularity of 
reality 
more generally, that fantology is conducive to 
reductionism in philosophy
Fantology
Tends to make you believe in some future 
state of ‘total science’
when the values of ‘F’ and ‘a’, all of them,
will be revealed to the elect
132
will be revealed to the elect
All true ontology is the ontology of a future 
perfected physics of ultimate atoms

The application of the 
fantological approach
to a subject-domain thus presupposes the 
isolation of some basic level of atoms 
but then brings the additional task of 
simulation of all structures appearing on
133
simulation of all structures appearing on 
higher levels by means of logical 
constructions. (Cf. Carnap’s Aufbau)
Fantology
Fa
The particular corresponds to a ‘bare name’, 
leading to a noumenal view of ‘bare particulars’
Cf Wittgenstein’s Tractatus doctrine of simples

Cf. Wittgenstein s Tractatus doctrine of simples 
– and his inability to name even one example
But then in virtue of what could it be the case

Armstrong: property universals are all we 
need
no need for kind universals

that there are no substances)

kind of content
– a is a human being
– a is negatively charged
– a is remote from Witwatersrand
– a swims regularly
– a is distinct from b

141
Confusion of universals and 
properties
The fantological doctrine of properties 
arises when we assume that to every 
predicate a property corresponds.
This doctrine of properties is ontologically 
empty

There is only one form of states of affairs

thus no distinction between, for example, 
predication in the category of substance

exist universals

Lecture 3
The Ontology of Social 
Reality
John Searle
174

Speech Acts (1969)
requesting, promising, commanding, 
baptising, marrying, apologizing, insulting, 
charging, forgiving, condemning, 
sentencing …
Social acts which are performed in the act 
of speaking and which change the world
175
176
The Construction of Social Reality
–
– I go into a café in Paris and sit in a chair at a table.
– The waiter comes and I utter a fragment of a French 
sentence. 
– I say, ‘un demi, Munich,  pression, s’il vous plaît.’ 
– The waiter brings the beer and I drink it. 
– I leave some money on the table and leave. 
–
THIS SCENE HAS A ‘HUGE INVISIBLE ONTOLOGY’
177
Social Reality
•
•
the waiter did not actually own the beer he gave me, but 
he is employed by the restaurant which owned it. 
•
The restaurant is required to post a list of the prices of all 
the boissons.
•
The owner of the restaurant is licensed by the French 
government to operate it. 
•
As such, he is subject to a thousand rules and 
regulations I know nothing about. 
•
I am entitled to be there in the first place only because I 
am a citizen of the United States, the bearer of a valid 
passport, and I have entered France legally. 
178
Searle does not provide a 
definition of ‘social object’
He is more interested in social facts
If the price of my stock rises, this is a social 
fact, but (Searle says) it is not a fact about 
some special sort of object called a social
some special sort of object called a social 
object
179
Nevertheless
we can extract a definition of social object 
from Searle’s work:
x is a social object =def  x counts as a y  in 
j
y
context C
where ‘y’ is a term like ‘president’, 
‘cathedral’, ‘driver’s license’
= cognitive theory of social objects
180

For example
x is a president =def x counts as a president 
in political contexts
x is a cathedral =def x counts as a cathedral 
in religious contexts
in religious contexts
x is a driver’s license =def x counts as a 
driver’s license in legal contexts
181
Social objects are physical objects 
+ special kinds of beliefs
Searle’s naturalism: x and y are one and the same 
part of physical reality (the only reality there is)
– a human being, a building, a piece of plastic –
but x is such as to fall under different descriptions: 
‘president’, ‘cathedral’, ‘drivers license’
182
PROBLEM FOR SEARLE
There are important provinces of social reality for 
which Searle’s definition does not work
because there is no underlying x term 
The y term is in such cases free-floating; it exists,
The y term is in such cases free floating; it exists, 
but it is not a part of physical reality
The y term exists because there are documents 
which record its existence
183
y = money in a bank account
There is no x term here
Rather the money in your bank account is merely 
represented by blips in the bank’s computer
To understand these matters properly we need to
To understand these matters properly we need to 
pay careful attention to the role of documents

but surely:
A normal chess game doesn’t consist of 
movements of pieces on a board, but of two 
alternating sequences of acts on the part of the 
players.
These are (intentional) acts of moving pieces on a 
board. 
A game of blind chess also consists of such 
alternating sequences of acts 
– but now these are speech acts which merely 
represent moves of pieces on a board.
Representing the movements takes the place of 
actually carrying out the movements. 
196
The idea:
A normal chess game doesn’t consist of 
movements of pieces on a board, but of 
two alternating sequences of acts on the 
part of the players.
NOTE THAT A SIMILAR ONTOLOGICAL 
ASSAY COULD NOT BE APPLIED IN 
THE CASE OF WAR
(there could be no such thing as blind war)

Searle’s Speech Acts (1969)
• Regulative Rules
l t
t
d
tl
i ti
•
regulate antecedently existing 
forms of behavior
•
as rules of polite table behavior 
regulate eating
202
Constitutive rules
– create new forms of behavior
– as the rules of chess create the very 
possibility of our engaging in the type of 
activity we call playing chess;
– they have the basic form: 
• x counts as y in context c
203
Examples
x = a certain arm movement
y = a signalling to turn left
• x = an utterance of the form 
•
‘I promise to mow the lawn’ 
• y = putting yourself under a corresponding 
obligation
204

Searle:
When you perform a speech act then you 
create an institutional fact
f
h
i
h
= a fact whose existence presupposes the 
existence of certain systems of constitutive 
rules called ‘institutions’
205
Examples of institutions:
•
money
•
property
•
marriage
•
government
g
•
chess
•
baseball
•Searle’s challenge is to develop an ontology of 
such phenomena that is both realist and 
naturalistic
206
Realism
social reality exists
it is not a mere fiction
Naturalism
Naturalism
•
Searle: There is one world, and 
everything in it is governed by the laws 
of physics (sometimes also by the laws 
of biology, neurology, …)
207
Social Reality
– By acting in accordance with constitutive rules 
– we are able to impose certain special rights, 
– duties, obligations
– – ‘deontic powers’ –
f
– on our fellow human beings and on the reality 
around us.
–Searle: this ‘involves a kind of magic’ 
208
Institutional facts 
•
= social facts involving  a deontic 
component;    
•
… they are facts which arise when 
human beings collectively award status 
functions to parts of reality
functions to parts of reality, 
•
which means: functions those parts of 
reality could not perform exclusively in virtue 
of their physical properties.
209
This works always via constitutive rules:
x counts as y in context c
– But then naturalism implies that both the x 
and the y terms in Searle’s formula range in 
every case over token physical entities

215
x counts as y, y counts as z
– … a y term can itself play the role of a new x 
term in iterations of the formula: 
•
status functions can be 
imposed upon physical reality as 
it has been shaped by earlier 
impositions of status function
216

–
– but, because of naturalism, this 
imposition of function 
gives us nothing ontologically new 
•
Barack Obama is still Barack Obama even 
when he counts as President; 
•
Miss Anscombe is still Miss Anscombe 
even when she counts as Mrs Geach
• Contrast non-naturalism of Tibetan Buddhism
217
Social Objects
•
While each y term is in a sense a 
new entity – President Clinton did not, 
after all, exist before his Inauguaration –
this new entity is from the physical 
perspective the same old entity as
perspective the same old entity as 
before. 
•
What has changed is the way the 
entity is treated in given contexts and 
the descriptions under which it falls.
218
Not Turtles All the Way Down
• Searle: wherever a status-
function is imposed there has to 
be something it is imposed upon
be something it is imposed upon 
• Eventually the hierarchy must 
bottom out in phenomena whose 
existence is not a matter of 
human agreement. 
219
Objects and events
•
The range of x and y terms includes not 
only individual substances (objects, things)
such as you and me but also events
•
as when an act of uttering counts as
as when an act of uttering counts as 
the making of a promise.
•Here the event itself does not physically 
change; no new event comes into being  –
merely: the event with which we start is 
treated in a special way. 
220
A Problem for Naturalism  
• This works when the y term exists 
simultaneously with the corresponding 
x term (e.g. utterance and promise)
• but how can an event which lasts for
• but how can an event which lasts for 
just 2 seconds be the bearer, the 
ontological support, the physical 
foundation, of deontic powers (e.g. 
claims, obligations) which continue to 
exist for several months or years? 
221
Searle’s response: 
•
“my analysis originally started with speech 
acts, and the whole purpose of a speech act 
such as promising 
•
“is to create an obligation that will 
continue to exist after the original promise has 
been made.
•
“I promise something on Tuesday, and the 
act of uttering ceases on Tuesday, but the 
obligation of the promise continues to exist 
over Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, etc.”
222

Searle admits
free-standing y terms: 
•
“that is not just an odd feature of 
speech acts, it is characteristic of the 
deontic structure of institutional reality.
deontic structure of institutional reality. 
•
“So, think for example, of creating a 
corporation. Once the act of creation of the 
corporation is completed, the corporation 
exists. 
•
“It need have no physical realization,
it may be just a set of status functions.”
223
Searle’s response: 
•
“The whole point of institutional facts is 
that once created they continue to exist as 
long as they are recognized. 
•
“You do not need the x term once you
•
You do not need the x term once you 
have created the y status function. 
•
“At least you do not need it for such 
abstract entities as obligations, 
responsibilities, rights, duties, and other 
deontic phenomena, and these are, or so I 
maintain, the heart of the ontology of 
institutional reality.” 
224
The Problem for Naturalism
•
How can Searle sustain naturalism 
AND accept free-standing y terms?
•
how can obligations, responsibilities, 
g
rights, duties, corporations – and blind 
chess games – exist in the very same 
reality that is described by physics and 
biology?

Mental acts do not count as obligations, any

•
Mental acts do not count as moves in chess

Rather, all of these things belong to the 
domain of records and registrations

Blips in computers merely represent money

property right

coordination of the actions of the human 
beings involved.
what is the physical basis for the 
temporally extended existence of its 
products and for their enduring power to 
serve coordination? 
243
Answer
In small societies: the memories of 
those involved
In large societies: documents –
documents create and sustain 
permanent re-usable deontic powers
244
245
Differences between document 
acts and speech acts
document acts can serve multiple ends (three-
for-the-price-of-one)
documents are continuant objects, which endure 
self-identically through time, and so can create
self identically through time, and so can create 
traceable liability 
documents can be attached together, creating 
new complexes whose structure mirrors 
relations among the human beings involved (of 
husband to wife, debtor to creditor) 
246

Differences between document 
acts and speech acts
speech acts are normally self-validating 
(they wear their provenance on their face)
documents need technological devices 
(official stamps, special watermarks, 
signatures, countersignatures, seals, ...)
247

The Searle thesis:
•
the performance of speech acts brings 
into being claims and obligations and 
deontic powers

are mechanisms for creating the 
institutional orders of modern societies

The ontology of (credit card)

‘thick’ (historical) numbers special sorts of
thick  (historical) numbers, special sorts of

We often take advantage of the abstract (non-
physical) status of free-standing y terms in order to 
manipulate them in quasi-mathematical ways:
–we pool and collateralize assets
–we securitize loans
–we consolidate debts

But these creative mysteries of capital work

To solve the problem of unifying data, 
what we need is an ‘information model’
378
HL7 Reference Information Model
Definition of Entity 
Entity =def. A physical thing, group of 
physical things or an organization capable 
of participating in Acts, while in a role.
379
States of Entity
• active: The state representing the fact that the 
Entity is currently active. 
• inactive: The state representing the fact that an 
entity can no longer be an active participant in 
events
events. 
• normal: The “typical” state. Excludes “nullified”, 
which represents the termination state of an 
Entity instance that was created in error 
• nullified: The state representing the termination 
of an Entity instance that was created in error. 
380

HL7: Persons are Entities
What does ‘active’ and ‘inactive’ mean as 
applied to Person? 
Is there a special kind of death-through-
nullification in the case of these instances
nullification in the case of these instances 
of Person who were created in error? 
(The definitions of ‘active’ and ‘inactive’ 
provide no assistance in this regard.)

What is going on here?
‘Person’, for HL7, refers not to persons, 
but to objects in information systems –
entities created through processes of data 
entry. 
They undergo not: processes such as 
being treated, falling ill, being born, dying 
… 
but: processes of being revised, 
reactivated, nullified

Ontologies have become core components of 
many large applications yet the training material 
has not kept pace with the growing interest. This 
paper addresses the issues of why one would 
build an ontology and presents a methodology for 
creating ontologies based on declarative 
knowledge representation systems. 
386

Ontology Development 101: A Guide to 
Creating Your First Ontology (2001)
“An ontology together with a set of 
individual instances of classes constitutes a
individual instances of classes constitutes a 
knowledge base. In reality, there is a fine 
line where the ontology ends and the 
knowledge base begins.”
387
Classes
“Classes are the focus of most ontologies. 
Classes describe concepts in the domain. For 
example, a class of wines represents all 
wines Specific wines are instances of this
wines. Specific wines are instances of this 
class. The Bordeaux wine in the glass in 
front of you … is an instance of the class 
of Bordeaux wines.”
388
From the Protégé glossary:
“Instance: Concrete occurrence of 
information about a domain that is entered 
into a knowledge base. For example, Fran 
Smith might be an instance for a Name slot
Smith might be an instance for a Name slot. 
An instances is entered via a form 
generated by Protégé-2000.”
389
From the Protégé glossary:
“… individual bottles of each wine 
may become individual instances =  
in our knowledge base.”
g
390
Instances
“we can create an individual instance 
Chateau-Morgon-Beaujolais to 
represent a specific type of Beaujolais 
wine. Chateau-Morgon-Beaujolais is an 
instance of the class Beaujolais”
391
An instance or a class?
“Deciding whether a particular concept 
[e.g. the Bourgogne region] is a class in 
an ontology or an individual instance 
depends on what the potential 
applications of the ontology are.”
392

Wines are the instances?
“Individual instances are the most specific 
concepts represented in a knowledge base:
if we are only going to talk about pairing 
wine with food we will not be interested in
wine with food we will not be interested in 
the specific physical bottles of wine. … the  
Wine class is [then] a collection not of 
individual bottles of wines but rather of the 
specific wines produced by specific 
wineries.”
393
Glasses, then? Or bottles?
“On the other hand, if we would like to 
maintain an inventory of wines in the 
restaurant … individual bottles of each 
wine may become individual instances in
wine may become individual instances in 
our knowledge base.”
394
Only 
“If concepts form a natural hierarchy, then 
we should represent them as classes.
Consider the wine regions. Initially, we may 
define main wine regions, such as France,
define main wine regions, such as France, 
United States, Germany, and so on, as 
classes and specific wine regions within 
these large regions as instances. For 
example, Bourgogne region is an instance 
of the French region class.”

All hierarchical relations in a knowledge base 
are subclass relations
396
All regions are classes
we would also like to say that the Cotes 
d’Or region is a Bourgogne region. 
Therefore, Bourgogne region must be a 
class … However, making Bourgogne 
region a class and Cotes d’Or region an
region a class and Cotes d Or region an 
instance of Bourgogne region seems 
arbitrary: it is very hard to clearly distinguish 
which regions are classes and which are 
instances. Therefore, we define all wine 
regions as classes.”

systems do not have a notion of sub-

they may not have any instances of their 
own.”

The Use-Mention Confusion
Swimming is healthy
Swimming has eight letters
8 is the square root of 64
8 is the square root of 64
8 is the output on my measuring device
Software engineers are allowed to 
commit use-mention errors, because 
they know what they are doing
411
The standard engineering methodology
Pragmatics (‘usefulness’) is everything
Usefulness = we get to write software 
which runs on our machines
It is easier to write software if we deal not 
with reality, but with simple models 
(“…We can’t know what reality is like in any 
case; we only have our concepts…”)

Why build scientific ontologies
“There are many ways to create ontologies 
…”
Multiple ontologies simply make our  
unification problems worse
unification problems worse 
We need to constrain ontologies so that 
they converge 
Just as bad scientific theories must die, so 
also bad ontologies must die
419
Science-based ontology 
development
Q: What is to serve as constraint in 
order to avoid silo creation ?
A: Reality, as revealed, incrementally, 
by experimentally-based science
420
Ontological realism
Find out what the world is like (= by 
doing science)
Build representations adequate to this 
world, not to some simplified model in 
your laptop
421
Ontology (Science)
Experimental results are being described in 
algorithmically useful ways with the help of 
ontologies like the GO 
Such ontologies are authored and maintained 
g
by scientists to support the sharing, retrieval, 
integration and analysis of their data 
Thesis: these ontologies are part of science. 
422

Ontologies like the Gene 
Ontology are part of science
They must be associated with 
computer implementations (with 
engineering artifacts)
engineering artifacts)
But the ontologies are not themselves 
engineering artifacts
The same ontology can be associated 
with multiple engineering artifacts
423
Ontologies like the GO are 
comparable to 
–scientific theories
–scientific databases 
–scientific journal publications
424
Ontologies like the GO are being 
used by scientific journal 
publications 
– to provide more useful access to 
article content via controlled structured 
k
d li t
keyword lists
– to provide a basis for creating formally 
structured versions of journal articles 
themselves 
425
Benefits of ontology peer review
1. will provide an impetus to the 
improvement of scientific knowledge 
over time
2 brings benefits to readers since they
2. brings benefits to readers, since they 
need only absorb and collate vetted 
ontologies, as opposed to all the 
ontologies available e.g. on the 
Semantic Web
426
Peer review creates incentives for 
investment of effort in ontology work
It gives career-related credit to both authors and 
reviewers (university promotions and funding 
based on peer review credit)
Supports creation of a professional career path for 
ontologists
It gives credit to scientific experts for investment of 
scientific expertise
It allows measurement of citations of ontologies
It magnifies the motivating potential of the factor of 
influence
427
For engineers, ontologies
1. can be bought and sold
2. need have no well-demarcated scientific 
domains
3. need not be subject to further 
maintenance
maintenance
4. can be stand-alone products
5. are typically tied to one specific 
implementation
Ontology (engineering) thereby makes 
the silo problem worse
428

Cntologies created to serve 
scientific purposes
1. are developed to be common resources 
(thus they cannot be bought or sold)
2. for representation of well-demarcated 
scientific domains
3. subject to constant maintenance by domain 
experts 
4. designed to be used in tandem with other, 
complementary ontologies
5. maximally independent of format and 
implementation
429
Background assumptions
Scientific hypotheses should be 
formulated by scientists
Scientific experiments should be carried 
out by scientists
out by scientists
Scientific databases should be developed 
and maintained by scientists
Scientific textbooks should be written by 
scientists
430
We need to annotate our data
to allow retrieval and integration of
– sequence and protein data for pathogens
– case report data for patients
– clinical trial data for drugs, vaccines
g
– epidemiological data for surveillance, 
prevention
– ...
Goal: to make data deriving from different 
sources comparable and computable
431
Goals of ontology (science)
1. to determine, empirically, the consensus 
core of ontology (science) – which high-
level principles work best?
2 to train a community of ontology experts
2. to train a community of ontology experts 
who will be in a position to apply and to 
extend this core in their scientific work. 
3. to establish ontology development as 
being, like statistics, a recognized part of 
the scientific enterprise. 
432
Goals of ontology (science)
4. to establish empirical methods of ontology 
evaluation
5. to establish a system of expert peer review for 
ontologies 
6. to work with journals to institute publishing of 
peer-reviewed ontologies 
7. to create an established set of non-overlapping 
ontology modules to be recommended for use in 
all data and literature annotation
433
Benefits of this approach
1. will provide an alternative to the existing 
computer (manufacturing) based approach, 
according to which: the more ontologies the 
better
2. will provide an impetus to the improvement 
of scientific knowledge over time
3. brings benefits to readers, since they need 
only absorb and collate vetted ontologies, 
as opposed to all the ontologies available 
e.g. on the semantic web. 
434

such filtering especially needed in 
biomedical ontology
Bill Bug: Until there is a reliable vetting 
procedure, we cannot expect to re-use 
existing ontologies effectively for the 
purpose of bringing like data together in
purpose of bringing like data together in 
novel ways .... Without vetting, we 
cannot expect to provide other 
developers with clear advice on what 
are the reliable ontological shoulders to 
build on. 
435
Benefits of orthogonality
helps those new to ontology to find what 
they need
provides models of good practice
ensures mutual consistency of ontologies
ensures mutual consistency of ontologies 
(trivially)
and thereby ensures additivity of 
annotations 
436
More benefits of orthogonality
it rules out simplification and 
partiality
brings an obligation on the part of 
ontology developers to commit to 
scientific accuracy and domain-
completeness
437
More benefits of orthogonality
helps to eliminate redundancy 
serves the division of ontological 
labor: allows experts to focus on 
their own domains of expertise
makes possible the establishment of 
clear lines of authority
438
The goal of orthogonality is a basic 
goal of science
it is a pillar of the scientific method that 
scientists should strive always to seek 
out and resolve conflicts between
out and resolve conflicts between 
competing theories 
439
is there a problem with orthogonality?
what if I need my own ontology of cellular 
membranes to meet my own special 
purposes?
strategy of application ontologies should
strategy of application ontologies should 
be developed from the start using terms 
whose definitions employ the resources 
of orthogonal ontologies like those 
within the Foundry
any other approach creates silos
440

Better to have one consensus 
ontology serving multiple purposes 
imperfectly
because multiple ontologies 
addressing the same domain, 
whether they are good ones or bad 
ones, create silos
441
For engineers, ontologies need possess 
none of these features
1. they can be bought and sold
2. they need have no well-demarcated 
scientific domains
3. they need not be subject to further 
y
j
maintenance
4. they can be stand-alone products
5. they are typically tied to one specific 
implementation
Ontology (engineering) thereby makes 
the silo problem worse

The special features of ontologies 
created to serve scientific purposes:
1. they are developed to be common 
resources (thus they cannot be bought or 
sold)
2. for representation of well-demarcated

experts 
4. designed to be used in tandem with other,

Lecture 6
Ontology and 
the Semantic Web
the Semantic Web

The problem of ontology
human beings can integrate highly 
heterogeneous information inside their 
heads
447
Consider how the human mind
copes with complex phenomena in the social 
realm (e.g. speech acts of promising) which 
involve: 
–
experiences (speaking, perceiving)
–
intentions (including potentially conflicting or
–
intentions (including potentially conflicting or 
disguised intentions)
–
language
–
action (and tendencies to action)
–
deontic powers, obligations, claims, authority …
–
background habits
–
mental competences 
–
records and representations
448
understanding how computers can effect 
the same sort of integration
is a difficult problem

level of metadata that will yield  the 
ability to query and integrate across 
different conceptual systems
451
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the 
internet
“sees a more powerful Web emerging, one 
where documents and data will be 
annotated with special codes allowing 
computers to search and analyze the Web 
automatically. The codes … are designed 
to add meaning to the global network in 
ways that make sense to computers”
452

Tim Berners-Lee:
hyperlinked vocabularies, called ‘ontologies’ 
will be used by Web authors “to explicitly 
define their words and concepts as they 
post their stuff online
post their stuff online. 
“The idea is the codes would let software 
‘agents’ analyze the Web on our behalf, 
making smart inferences that go far 
beyond the simple linguistic analyses 
performed by today's search engines.”

Assumptions
Communication / compatibility problems 
should be solved automatically 
(by machine)
Hence ontologies must be applications

Computational tractability
Semantic Web Ontologies are computer artifacts 
subject to severe constraints on expressive 
OWL DL (for Description Logic) a maximum 
fragment of first order logic for which a complete 
inference procedure and a decision procedure are 
known to exist
Brings considerable benefits in building ontologies –
you can check your ontology for consistency

(pizzas, family relations …); less good when it 
comes to dealing with time and instances

Therefore: All your poems are bad.

the promise of the Semantic Web
it will improve all the areas of your life 
where you currently use syllogisms
462
most of the data we use in our 
everyday lives is not amenable to 
recombination in syllogistic form

The Semantic Web Initiative
The Web is a vast edifice of 
heterogeneous data sources
Needs the ability to query and integrate 
across different data systems

464

How resolve incompatibilities?
The Semantic Web idea:
create terminological compatibility via 
standardized term hierarchies, with standardized 
definitions of terms, which
1. satisfy the needed logical constraints
2. are applied as meta-tags to the content of 
websites
(Tim Berners-Lee: we need to do this without 
losing the sorts of freedoms exemplified by the 
existing html-based web)
465
Merging Databases
In the brave new world of the Semantic Web, 
“Merging databases simply becomes a 
matter of recording in RDF somewhere that 
"Person Name" in your database is 
equivalent to "Name" in my database and
equivalent to Name  in my database, and 
then throwing all of the information together 
and getting a processor to think about it.” 
[http://infomesh.net/2001/swintro/] 
Is your "Person Name = John Smith" the 
same person as my "Name = John Q. 
Smith"? Who knows? Not the Semantic Web

Clay Shirkey:

like many visions that project future benefits 
but ignore present costs, it requires too much 
coordination and too much energy to be 
effective in the real world …
“A world of exhaustive, reliable metadata

472
Problem 1: People lie
Meta-utopia is a world of reliable
metadata. 
But poisoning the well can confer 
benefits to the poisoners

DOLCE taxonomy
DOLCE taxonomy
DOLCE taxonomy

1 - The physical view (= one of 
many views)
Basic qualities ascribed to atomic 
spacetime regions (e.g., mass, 
electric charge…)
g
)
physical processes are 
spatiotemporal distributions of 
qualities
2 - The cognitive view
Humans isolate relevant invariances 
on the basis of:
– Perception (as resulting from 
evolution)
– Cognition and cultural experience
– Language
A set of atomic percepts is 
associated to each situation
is this consistent with common sense?

DOLCE embraces abstract (non-
physical) entities
= entities with no inherent spatial 
localization
Dependent on agents
• mental (depending on singular agents)
• social (depending on communities of 
agents)
Agentive: a company, an institution
Non-agentive: a law, the Divine 
Comedy, a linguistic system
Advantages of DOLCE

Let’s constrain our data models so that

Scientific ontologies have 
special features
Every term in a scientific ontology must be

such that the developers of the ontology 
believe it to refer to some entity* in reality on

For science, and thus for scientific 
ontologies,
it is generalizations that are of

g
prime important = universals, 
types, kinds, species
For scientific ontologies
reusability, openness is crucial
intelligibility to humans is crucial
revisability is crucial 
533
there is always an open world 
assumption
testability is crucial
compatibility with neighboring scientific 
ontologies is crucial it should not be 
too easy to add new terms to an 
ontology
For scientific ontologies
the issue of how the ontology will be used
is not a factor relevant for determining how 
entities are treated by the ontology

If this decision is made to reflect specific, 
local practical needs, this will thwart 
reusability of the data the ontology is used

function =def.
a disposition that
exists in virtue of the bearer’s physical make-up,, 
and
and
this physical make-up is something the bearer 
possesses because it came into being, either 
through evolution (in the case of natural biological 
entities) or through intentional design (in the case 
of artifacts), in order to realize processes of a 
certain kind.

Disposition 
Internally-Grounded Realizable Entity
A disposition is
a realizable entity which is such that
( ) f
(1) if it ceases to exist, then its bearer is 
physically changed, and
(2) whose realization occurs, in virtue of 
the bearer’s physical make-up, when this 
bearer is in some special physical 
circumstances
588
Disorder
A part of an (extended) organism which 
serves as the bearer of a disposition of a 
certain sort

Disorder
A fiat object part of an organism which 
serves as the bearer of a disposition of a 
certain sort
This fiat object part is part of the organism
This fiat object part is part of the organism 
and in the case of progressive diseases 
typically grows larger through time
It is real, but it may have no determinate 
boundaries

Elucidation of Primitive Terms
‘bodily feature’ - an abbreviation for a physical 
component, a bodily quality, or a bodily process.
disposition - an attribute describing the propensity 
to initiate certain specific sorts of processes 
when certain conditions are satisfied.
clinically abnormal - some bodily feature that
clinically abnormal
some bodily feature that 
– (1) is not part of the life plan for an organism of the 
relevant type (unlike aging or pregnancy), 
– (2) is causally linked to an elevated risk either of pain 
or other feelings of illness, or of death or dysfunction, 
and 
– (3) is such that the elevated risk exceeds a certain 
threshold level.*
*Compare: baldness

Dispositions and Predispositions
All diseases are dispositions; not all 
dispositions are diseases.
A predisposition is a disposition.

Why GO is so successful
Strategy of low hanging fruit
Lessons learned and disseminated as 
common guidelines – all developers in a 
large community are doing it the same 
way
Ontologies are built by domain experts
Ontologies based on real thinking (not for 
example on automatic extraction of terms 
from text)

UCore Initiative
• The UCore initiative focused on improving 
national readiness and international security by 
developing a common technical approach and 
vocabulary that enable information sharing 
609
between Federal, state, regional, and local 
governments, along with civil and non-
governmental organizations, and U. S. coalition 
partners and allies. 
UCore Initiative
• An XML schema was defined containing agreed-
upon representations for the most commonly 
shared and universally understood concepts of 
who, what, when, and where in order to promote 
610
Federal information sharing.

OWL DL allows use of UCore SL
• To leverage UCore 2.0 by facilitating consistent merging 
with other OWL DL resources
• Provides logically articulated definitions
• To support use of W3C-standards-based software 
providing:
• Enhanced reasoning with UCore message content
• Enhanced quality assurance
• Consistent evolution of UCore
• Reliable and consistent extension modules
623

Using UCore SL as a 
supporting layer makes it 
possible to identify that 
something cannot be both a 
Person and an Organization
Provides Additional Logical Resources
Logically speaking, UCore 2.0 is too 
weak to detect simple inconsistencies.
624
Provide automatic 
warnings e.g. for 
potential 
ambiguities in 
UCore 2.0 terms 
and definitions
Automatic 
consistency 
checking when 
extensions to  
UCore 2.0 are 
proposed
Potential Benefits for UCore 2.0
Identify logical 
gaps in UCore 
2.0 taxonomy and 
relations
Allow integration 
of UCore 2.0 
XML-based 
technology with 
W3C  (Semantic 
Web) content
625
Provide flexible 
refactoring of UCore 
2.0 for different 
(DoD, IC, DoJ, …) 
purposes, while 
preserving 
interoperability 
Allow 
development of 
standards-based 
tools to support 
and enhance 
verification of 
UCore messages 
for correctness 
Potential Benefits for UCore Users
Application of more 
powerful logic-based 
tools e.g. in 
identifying referents 
of terms using in 
messages
Help UCore users 
work more 
effectively in 
retrieving and 
processing 
messages
626
What NCOR can do for UCore users
NCOR has several years experience applying 
semantic technology to terminology resources 
across multiple domains, including:

Biosurveillance
G
ti l i f
ti

Geospatial information

Multi-source data and information fusion

Infectious disease

Petrochemical industry

Vaccine research
627

What NCOR can do for UCore users
NCOR offers services in three areas:
Training in use of semantic technology 
Evaluation of terminology resources
Creating consistent extensions of core resources 
that work well across multiple domains
Use of semantic technology to support reasoning 
with data 
628
Benefits of Coordination
Each new Community of Interest (COI): 
• can profit from lessons learned at earlier stages 
and avoid common mistakes
• can more easily reuse tested software resources
y
• can collect data in forms which will make it 
automatically comparable with data already 
collected
No need to reinvent the wheel
629
Example: Command and Control
The C2 Domain consists of 6 components:
Force Structure, Integration, Organization
Situational Awareness
Planning and Analysis
Decision Making and Direction
Operational Functions and Tasks
Monitoring Progress (Assessing)
C2 Core Ontology is based upon these elements

Multiple Inheritance
This tank is always a type of 
“Ground Vehicle”
At “Time T” it was also 
“Cargo”
As COI’s extend UCore 2.0 to provide 
more specific coverage of their domains, 
entities will be sub-typed under multiple 
parent terms in order to accommodate the 
attributes they acquire during their 
participation in events.

How UCore SL helps
These proposed changes to UCore 2.0 were generated 
automatically via a very simple error-checking process 
based on the logical relations incorporated into UCore SL

Leading Army Data Transformation
As UCore 2.x grows larger, and the number of extensions 
continues to grow, this facility for quality assurance will 
become ever more important
In this way, as in biology and medicine, so also in 
government, logical and ontological rigor can contribute 
to the realization of the information sharing needs of the 
future.
