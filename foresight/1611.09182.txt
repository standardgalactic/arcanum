Abstract
This thesis constitutes a ﬁrst attempt to derive aspects of standard model particle physics
from little more than an algebra. Here, we argue that physical concepts such as particles,
causality, and irreversible time may result from the algebra acting on itself.
We then focus on a special case by considering the algebra R ⊗C ⊗H ⊗O, the tensor
product of the only four normed division algebras over the real numbers. Using nothing
more than R ⊗C ⊗H ⊗O acting on itself, we set out to ﬁnd standard model particle
representations: a task which occupies the remainder of this text.
From the C ⊗H portion of the algebra, we ﬁnd generalized ideals, and show that they
describe concisely all of the Lorentz representations of the standard model.
From just the C ⊗O portion of the algebra, we ﬁnd minimal left ideals, and show that
they mirror the behaviour of a generation of quarks and leptons under su(3)c and u(1)em.
These unbroken symmetries, su(3)c and u(1)em, appear uniquely in this model as particular
symmetries of the algebra’s ladder operators. Electric charge, here, is seen to be simply a
number operator for the system.
We then combine the C ⊗H and C ⊗O portions of R ⊗C ⊗H ⊗O, and focus on
a leptonic subspace, so as to demonstrate a rudimentary electroweak model. Here, the
underlying ladder operators are found to have a symmetry generated uniquely by su(2)L
and u(1)Y . Furthermore, we ﬁnd that this model yields a straightforward explanation as
to why SU(2)L acts only on left-handed states.
We then make progress towards a three-generation model. The action of C⊗O on itself
can be seen to generate a 64-complex-dimensional algebra, wherein we are able to identify
two sets of generators for SU(3)c. We apply these generators to the rest of the space,
and ﬁnd that it breaks down into the SU(3)c representations of exactly three generations
of quarks and leptons. Furthermore, we show that these three-generation results can be
extended, so as to include all 48 fermionic U(1)em charges.

Introduction
1.1
Towards conceptual parsimony
The safest conceivable theory is one which implements the fewest initial assumptions pos-
sible. That is, any model based on elaborate input will by deﬁnition specify more detail
than would a simple one, and hence will be more likely to be in conﬂict with reality.
Our current theories of fundamental physics are often described in terms of an assort-
ment of objects such as manifolds, metric tensor ﬁelds, matter ﬁelds, gauge ﬁelds, Fock
spaces, etc. One might wonder if it could be possible to choose our starting point more
conservatively.
This thesis may be thought of as an experiment of sorts. It is a ﬁrst attempt to see just
how close one can get to standard model predictions, while using as little theoretical input
as possible. The original proposal of this idea was put forward in a Part III research essay
for a Master’s degree in 2006, [33], [32]. Certainly, this project can be seen to be far from
complete. However, it does demonstrate how certain carefully-chosen, low-dimensional,
mathematical objects can parallel a considerable amount of the standard model’s structure.
Over the next 85 pages, we will work towards developing a model which is based on
the same principles of uniﬁcation and simpliﬁcation, which have driven much of theoretical
physics since the 1970s. All objects in our model will be pieced together from the same
algebra, although, we will not unify the gauge groups of the standard model in the same
sense as do grand uniﬁed theories. We will ﬁnd that both fermions and bosons should arise
together from the same algebra. Having said that, we will not implement supersymmetry
at this stage. Although the road to uniﬁcation has been an arduous one, we maintain that
it is an idea worthy of staying the course.

1.2
Outline
In Chapter 2 of this thesis, we give a brief sketch of our experiment, which motivates the
algebraic model being proposed. In Chapter 3, we introduce the algebra of the complex
quaternions, C⊗H, and with them, demonstrate all of the Lorentz representations necessary
to describe the standard model. Then, in Chapter 4, we review some basic characteristics of
Cliﬀord algebras, while in Chapter 5, we review some basic characteristics of the standard
model. In Chapter 6 we introduce the complex octonions, C ⊗O, and show how they
can provide a direct route to the unbroken internal symmetries, generated by su(3)c and
u(1)em, for one generation of quarks and leptons. These symmetries appear as unitary
MTIS symmetries, which are ﬁrst introduced in this chapter.
In Chapter 7, we then
combine the C ⊗H and C ⊗O results to show a rudimentary leptonic model. The unitary
MTIS symmetries, found here, happen to be none other than su(2)L and u(1)Y on these
states. Furthermore, we ﬁnd that this model can oﬀer an explanation as to why SU(2) acts
on states of only one chirality (left). In Chapter 8, we review some of the algebraic structure
of SU(5) and Spin(10) grand uniﬁed theories, as well as the Pati-Salam model. Finally,
in Chapter 9, we go on to demonstrate how the SU(3)c and U(1)em representations for
exactly three generations of standard model fermions can be found, using (paradoxically)
nothing more than the eight-complex dimensional algebra, C ⊗O.

Chapter 2
What lies in an algebra?
In this ﬁrst chapter, we introduce an attempt to describe established results in particle
physics, while working from the fewest initial assumptions possible. Our only input will
be an algebra, A.
The ideas outlined here originate from a Cambridge Part III research essay, [33], [32]
and have provided the underlying intuition for three papers published during these PhD
years, [36], [35], and [34]. With this being said, the results from those three publications
may be considered independently from the ideas sketched here in this chapter, which are
still at an early stage of development.
Much of the material in this chapter was submitted in 2014 to FQXi’s annual call for
essays in fundamental physics, [30].
2.1
Causality
Suppose for a moment that nature were represented by an algebra, A. We will start, then,
simply with an unevaluated algebraic expression. Consider for example
f · (e · (d · c + b · a)),
(2.1)
where a, b, c, d, e, f are elements of A. Taking multiplication to be the propagation along
an edge, and addition to be the joining of two edges at a vertex, it can be seen that this
unevaluated algebraic expression gives a causal set. Please see Figure (2.1).

Figure 2.1:
The unevaluated algebraic expression, f · (e · (d · c + b · a)), gives a causal set.
A causal set is a set S together with the relation, ≤, such that
1. if x ≤y and y ≤z, then x ≤z
∀x, y, z ∈S
(transitive),
2. if x ≤y and y ≤x, then x = y
∀x, y ∈S
(non-circular),
3. for any given x, z ∈S, the set of elements {y | x ≤y ≤z} is ﬁnite
(locally ﬁnite).
In Figure (2.1), S is given by the set of vertices, and the relations ≤are indicated by
the arrows between those vertices.
It is at this early stage only a conjecture that any (associative) algebraic expression
gives a causal set. For an introduction to causal sets, please see [28], [10] and [55].
So it seems to be possible that causality, of all things, could already appear at the level
of an algebra.
Now, we would like to propose an unorthodox interpretation for these causal sets.
That is, a causal set is not meant to represent discrete space-time, but is instead meant to
represent particle worldlines. In other words, matter exhibits its own causal structure, and
there is no such thing as a space-time point. This picture has particles with no underlying
space-time whatsoever, neither continuous, nor discrete.
The question we are then asking here is whether or not space-time can be seen to be as
surprisingly unnecessary as was the luminiferous aether from one hundred years ago. Can
4

particles exist independently, without the crutch of a fundamental space-time to support
them?
Similar in spirit is an earlier spaceless graph model, proposed by Kribs and Markopoulou
in [47], where particles emerge at low energies as noiseless subsystems of quantum infor-
mation processing structures. These models diﬀer from the popular causal set models of
Dowker, Sorkin, and Surya, whose vertices represent space-time points. In Dowker, Sorkin,
and Surya’s models, the vertices specify a position and a time. In the model presented in
this thesis, however, the vertices instead specify the internal degrees of freedom of particles,
such as spin, colour and electric charge, etc.
Over the past ten years, a number of authors have come forward with a variety models,
which each call into question the necessity of a fundamental space-time. In 2005, Piazza
did so by proposing to replace localized regions of space with quantum subsystems in [59],
[58], an idea which was later developed in 2007 by Piazza and Costa, [60]. In 2010, Van
Raamsdonk, [61], proposed building up space-time with quantum entanglement using gauge
theory/gravity duality. More recently in 2014, Wieland proposed a model of simplicial
gravity, constructed from spinors, [67].
In the same year, W. Edwards described non-
embeddable relational conﬁgurations, [29]. Also related to these concepts are works by
Kempf in 2013, [45], and Saravani, Aslanbeigi, and Kempf in 2015, [52], which discuss how
space-time curvature can be encoded in the vacuum entanglement structure of ﬁelds.
In 2013, Cortˆes and Smolin published work on Energetic Causal Sets, [24], [25], which
describes a spaceless causal set, constructed out of particles at the fundamental level.
This basic concept overlaps signiﬁcantly with [32]: ideas of L. Smolin’s PhD student at
the time (the present author). The notes, [32], were written up for L. Smolin in 2011
upon his request, and subsequently emailed to him. (He later innocently forgot about the
notes when [24] and [25] were published two years later.) We also point out the relevant
earlier work of [47], who proposed a spaceless causal set of quantum information processing
systems, with particles emerging in the low energy limit.
2.2
Irreversible time
Recently, it has been emphasized in the fundamental physics community, [30], that theories
like general relativity do a poor job of encapsulating our experience of events unfolding.
For example, there is nothing in the theory to explain why events happen, but do not
‘unhappen’.
It seems, however, that an algebra might well provide such a notion of irreversible time.
5

In the case of an algebra, an event is a calculation. Taking our algebra A = R, for example,
an event is the evaluation of 6+3 to give 9, or the evaluation of 5·2 to give 10.
Addition and multiplication are examples of uninvertible binary operations. Therefore,
an event can be seen to be irreversible, it cannot ‘unhappen’. For example, if we are given
only the output of 9, it is impossible to tell if 9 came from the inputs of 6+3, or 8+1, or
4+5, etc.
Time, then, is simply a sequence of calculations, and is clearly irreversible. The related
notion of ‘now’ can be seen to be an entirely local concept within the causal set.
2.3
Particles
Some carefully chosen algebras, such as the complex Cliﬀord algebra, A = Cl(2), naturally
contain subspaces called ideals. Intuitively speaking, an ideal is a special subspace of an
algebra because it can survive multiplication by any element in A.
Ideals persisting under multiplication bear a striking resemblance to particles persisting
under propagation. The proposal, then, is that particles could be singled out in the algebra,
thanks to a mathematical incarnation of Darwin’s natural selection.
Ideals ∼particles.
Given an algebra, A, a left ideal, B, is a subalgebra of A whereby ab is in B for all b in
B, and for any a in A. That is, no matter which a we multiply onto b, the new product,
b′ ≡ab, must be in the subspace B (i.e. the ideal B survives). It is easy to see how b′ ≡ab
could easily describe, for example, a particle b undergoing propagation along a.
These concepts have a strong connection to well-known physics. In this text, we will
ﬁrst introduce the notion of generalized ideals. Taking A to be the complex quaternions,
C ⊗H ≃Cl(2), we will then see how generalized ideals lead to left- and right-handed
Weyl spinors, [34]. In an analogous construction, starting from the complex octonions,
A = C ⊗O, generalized ideals will be seen to lead to a set of states behaving like a full
generation of quarks and leptons, [36].
Ultimately, we intend to merge C ⊗H and C ⊗O together, via a tensor product over
C, resulting in the algebra A = R ⊗C ⊗H ⊗O. Loosely speaking, we will associate C ⊗H
with Lorentzian degrees of freedom: spin and chirality, while the octonionic part of the
algebra will give rise to the other internal degrees of freedom, such as colour, weak isospin,
and charge.
6

C ⊗H ∼Lorentz
C ⊗O ∼Other internal: colour, charge, etc.
The Dixon algebra, R ⊗C ⊗H ⊗O, is the tensor product of the only four normed
division algebras over the real numbers: the real numbers, R, the complex numbers, C,
the quaternions, H, and the octonions, O. Its connection to particle physics was studied
indirectly by Casalbuoni et al., [8], [13], [14], and later much more extensively by Dixon,
[26]. Our goal of identifying standard model structure from R⊗C⊗H⊗O aligns with that
of these earlier authors, however, our implementation of this algebra diﬀers signiﬁcantly,
particularly with respect to chirality and weak isospin, and in our treatment of antiparticles.
2.4
Summary and outlook
We come from sketching a model, whose only fundamental input is an algebra, A. From
the algebraic expressions of A, we argue that multiple physical concepts can materialize.
Such resulting physical concepts may include causality, particles, and irreversible time.
Notably, particles may be seen to arise as the algebra’s most stable subspaces.
The algebra, A, will be taken to be R ⊗C ⊗H ⊗O for reasons that will become clear
throughout this thesis. In the future, however, it would be worth investigating whether or
not even R ⊗C ⊗H ⊗O could be simpliﬁed. Explicitly, R ⊗C ⊗H ⊗O could be replaced
with another mathematical object, which approximates it in some limit, but which lacks
any occurrence of uncountable inﬁnities, which are inherent to the real number system.
With this rough draft of a model, we would like to now develop the idea. But where to
begin? Perhaps the most straightforward way to see if the algebra R ⊗C ⊗H ⊗O could
stand a chance of eventually producing standard model scattering amplitudes, is to see if
it can ﬁrst produce standard model group representations. This task will occupy the rest
of the thesis.

Chapter 3
Complex quaternions
3.1
Preamble
A signiﬁcant challenge within causal set programs has been to explain the existence of
3+1 dimensions. That is, any causal set chosen at random is highly unlikely to have this
particular dimension of our choosing.
It is for this reason that we propose here causal sets originating from an algebra, A. The
idea then is that a careful choice of algebra will impart on the causal set the desired 3+1
Lorentzian structure. In this section, we will consider A = C⊗H, the complex quaternions.
Between the left and right action of C ⊗H on itself, we will now introduce an unusually
compact way of describing all of the (3+1) Lorentz representations of the standard model
of particle physics.
3.2
Introduction to C ⊗H
Any element of the complex quaternions can be described as the complex linear combina-
tion,
c0 + c1 iϵx + c2 iϵy + c3 iϵz,
(3.1)
where the cn ∈C. The element i is the usual complex imaginary unit, with i2 = −1, that
commutes with all of the elements in the algebra. The quaternionic imaginary units, ϵx,
ϵy, and ϵz follow the multiplication rules
8

ϵx
2 = ϵy
2 = ϵz
2 = ϵx ϵy ϵz = −1,
(3.2)
which lead to the identities ϵxϵy = −ϵyϵx = ϵz, ϵyϵz = −ϵzϵy = ϵx, ϵzϵx = −ϵxϵz = ϵy. The
complex quaternions form an associative algebra, meaning that (ab) c = a (bc) ∀a, b, c
∈C ⊗H. (Note that all tensor products will be assumed to be over R in this text, unless
otherwise stated.)
From their behaviour under multiplication, one may associate iϵx with the more familiar
Pauli matrix σx = ( 0 1
1 0 ), iϵy with σy = ( 0 −i
i
0 ), and iϵz with σz = ( 1
0
0 −1 ). Note, however,
that the set {iϵx, iϵy, iϵz} transforms more symmetrically under complex conjugation than
does {σx, σy, σz},
σ∗
x = σx,
σ∗
y = −σy,
σ∗
z = σz,
versus
(iϵx)∗= −iϵx,
(iϵy)∗= −iϵy,
(iϵz)∗= −iϵz.
(3.3)
Elements of the form s ≡r1ϵx + r2iϵx + r3ϵy + r4iϵy + r5ϵz + r6iϵz for rn ∈R can easily
be seen to give a representation of the Lie algebra sl(2, C), using the usual commutator,
[s, s′] ≡ss′ −s′s.
Later in Section 3.5, we will ﬁnd that L ≡eis ∈C⊗H represents an element of SL(2, C),
which acts on left-handed Weyl spinors. These Weyl spinors also reside in C ⊗H, and in
fact, all of the results obtained throughout this thesis will follow simply from having an
algebra A act on itself.
3.3
Conjugation
In this text, the complex conjugate of an element a will be denoted a∗. The conjugate ∗
maps the complex i 7→−i, in the usual way.
The quaternion conjugate of a will be denoted ea, and ∼maps the quaternionic ϵx 7→−ϵx,
ϵy 7→−ϵy, and ϵz 7→−ϵz.
That which we call the hermitian conjugate of a will be denoted a†, and † is the
result of performing both the complex and quaternion conjugates simultaneously: i 7→−i,
ϵx 7→−ϵx, ϵy 7→−ϵy, and ϵz 7→−ϵz.
9

It is important to note that both the quaternion and hermitian conjugates reverse the
order of multiplication, as is familiar from matrix multiplication. For example, (ab)† = b†a†.
3.4
Generalized ideals
We deﬁne a subalgebra B of an algebra A to be a generalized ideal if m (a, b) ∈B, ∀b ∈B
and for any a ∈A, where m is (generalized) multiplication. The notion of a generalized
ideal was introduced by this author in [34], and diﬀers from the deﬁnition of left ideals by
generalizing what is meant by ‘multiplication’. Directly from the deﬁnition, it can be seen
that ideals make up the algebra’s most robust subspaces, which persist no matter what a
is multiplied onto them.
Starting from the algebra A = C⊗H, we will ﬁnd generalized ideals under three separate
notions of generalized multiplication:
the complex invariant-action,
mc(a, b) ≡abP + a∗bP ∗,
the hermitian invariant-action,
mh(a, b) ≡aba†,
and quaternionic invariant-action,
mq(a, b) ≡abea.
(3.4)
Here, P is a projector in C ⊗H, to be deﬁned shortly. It should be noted that each of
these multiplication rules is constructed so as to preserve conjugation-invariant objects.
For example, elements, b in C ⊗H with the property b∗= b will maintain this property
under mc, no matter which a ∈C ⊗H is multiplied onto them.
Taking A to be C ⊗H, we will ﬁrst show how the complex invariant-action leads to
left- and right-handed Weyl spinors, Majorana spinors, and Dirac spinors. Then we will
show how the hermitian invariant-action leads to four-vectors. Finally, we will show how
the quaternionic invariant action leads to scalars and the ﬁeld strength tensor.

(spinors)
mh

Readers should note that scalars, spinors, four-vectors, and the ﬁeld strength tensor, men-
tioned above, account for all of the Lorentz representations of the standard model.
3.5
Complex invariant-action, mc
3.5.1
Preliminaries
We will now ﬁnd that left- and right-handed Weyl spinors, Majorana spinors, and Dirac
spinors are all generalized ideals under the same complex invariant-action,
b′ = a b P + a∗b P ∗.
(3.5)
For concreteness, we deﬁne P to be the projector
1
2 (1 + iϵz), although it is clear that
a continuum of other possibilities exist. P and its complex conjugate, P ∗, exhibit the
properties
PP = P,
P ∗P ∗= P ∗,
PP ∗= P ∗P = 0,
P + P ∗= 1.
(3.6)
Before we begin, though, it will be useful to carry out a change of basis from {1, iϵx, iϵy, iϵz}
to a new, suggestively named basis, {ϵ↑↑, ϵ↓↑, ϵ↑↓, ϵ↓↓}. This new basis will be linked to the
operator, iϵz ∼σz, in that these basis elements will be deﬁned so as to have the properties:
iϵz ϵ↑↑= + ϵ↑↑
ϵ↑↑iϵz = + ϵ↑↑
iϵz ϵ↓↑= −ϵ↓↑
ϵ↓↑iϵz = + ϵ↓↑
iϵz ϵ↑↓= + ϵ↑↓
ϵ↑↓iϵz = −ϵ↑↓
iϵz ϵ↓↓= −ϵ↓↓
ϵ↓↓iϵz = −ϵ↓↓.
(3.7)
In terms of the old basis, we deﬁne these new basis vectors to be
ϵ↑↑≡1
2 (1 + iϵz)
ϵ↓↑≡1
2 (ϵy + iϵx)
ϵ↑↓≡1
2 (−ϵy + iϵx)
ϵ↓↓≡1
2 (1 −iϵz) .
(3.8)
For convenience, we also include here the old basis in terms of the new one,
1 = ϵ↑↑+ ϵ↓↓
ϵx = −i (ϵ↓↑+ ϵ↑↓)
ϵy = ϵ↓↑−ϵ↑↓
ϵz = −i (ϵ↑↑−ϵ↓↓) .
(3.9)
11

3.5.2
Weyl and Dirac spinors as generalized ideals
Let us now identify two subspaces, which partition the algebra C ⊗H. These subspaces
will be given the suggestive nomenclature ΨL and ΨR, and be deﬁned as
ΨL ≡ψ↑
L ϵ↑↑+ ψ↓
L ϵ↓↑
ΨR ≡ψ↑
R ϵ↑↓+ ψ↓
R ϵ↓↓,
(3.10)
where ψ↑
L, ψ↓
L, ψ↑
R, ψ↓
R ∈C. Readers may notice that spin and chirality are analogues of
each other in this formalism, as transitions between spin states occur via left multiplication,
and transitions between L and R occur via right multiplication.
Straightforward calculation shows that
ΨL P = ΨL
ΨL P ∗= 0,
ΨR P = 0
ΨR P ∗= ΨR.
(3.11)
Now, the reader may conﬁrm that ΨL and ΨR are left ideals, as deﬁned in Chapter 2.
That is, no matter which a1 and a2 are left multiplied onto them, there exists some ΨL
′ ≡
ψ↑
L
′ ϵ↑↑+ ψ↓
L
′ ϵ↓↑and ΨR
′ ≡ψ↑
R
′ ϵ↑↓+ ψ↓
R
′ ϵ↓↓such that
a1ΨL = ΨL
′
a2ΨR = ΨR
′.
(3.12)
In other words, the L and R subspaces are each stable under left multiplication.
With this knowledge in hand, it is now almost trivial to see that ΨL and ΨR are each
generalized ideals under the complex invariant-action, mc. That is, for any a ∈C ⊗H,
there exists a Ψ′
L such that
Ψ′
L = aΨL = aΨLP = aΨLP + a∗ΨLP ∗= mc(a, ΨL).
(3.13)
Likewise, for any a∗∈C ⊗H, there exists a Ψ′
R such that
Ψ′
R = a∗ΨR = a∗ΨRP ∗= aΨRP + a∗ΨRP ∗= mc(a, ΨR).
(3.14)
It is furthermore easily seen that the set of elements of the form ΨD ≡ΨL + ΨR spans all
of C ⊗H, and hence trivially qualiﬁes as a generalized ideal under mc.
Taking now a to be L = eis from Section 3.2 gives the transformation
ΨD
′ = mc(L, ΨD) = LΨL + L∗ΨR.
(3.15)
12

The reader is encouraged to conﬁrm that indeed ΨD transforms as a Dirac spinor, ΨL
transforms as a left-handed Weyl spinor, and ΨR transforms as a right-handed Weyl spinor
under SL(2, C). In other words, the complex coeﬃcients within ΨD transform exactly as
would the complex components of a four-dimensional column vector, representing a Dirac
spinor, from standard quantum ﬁeld theory. It is for this reason that the names ΨD, ΨL,
and ΨR were given to these generalized ideals early on.
3.5.3
A seamless new way to conjugate Weyl spinors
In quantum ﬁeld theory textbooks, it is typically explained that a left handed Weyl spinor,
ΨL, can be conjugated so as to give a right-handed Weyl spinor. The procedure necessary
to do so, in the usual matrix-and-column-vector formalism, entails (1) complex conjugating
the left-handed spinor’s two components, and (2) multiplying this column vector by the
matrix ϵ = −iσy = ( 0 −1
1
0 ),
h
ψ↑
L, ψ↓
L
i⊤
→(1) →
h
ψ↑
L
∗, ψ↓
L
∗i⊤
→(2) →
h
−ψ↓
L
∗, ψ↑
L
∗i⊤
.
(3.16)
Notice what happens, though, if we write these Weyl spinors instead in terms of the
C ⊗H algebra:
Ψ∗
L = ψ↑
L
∗ϵ↑↑
∗+ ψ↓
L
∗ϵ↓↑
∗= −ψ↓
L
∗ϵ↑↓+ ψ↑
L
∗ϵ↓↓.
(3.17)
That is, we arrive at the exact same result using nothing more than the complex conjugate:
i 7→−i.
Now, in order to return back to the original left-handed Weyl spinor, in the usual
matrix-and-column-vector formalism, we must again (1) complex conjugate the spinor’s
components, but this time, (2)′ multiply by the new matrix −ϵ,
h
−ψ↓
L
∗, ψ↑
L
∗i⊤
→(1) →
h
−ψ↓
L, ψ↑
L
i⊤
→(2)′ →
h
ψ↑
L, ψ↓
L
i⊤
.
(3.18)
In comparison, the same result is achieved in C ⊗H more simply by taking the complex
conjugate twice,
ΨL
∗∗= ΨL.
(3.19)
13

Readers should note that ∗: ΨL 7→ΨR is a basis-independent statement in our formal-
ism. It holds, regardless of whether ΨL is written in the Weyl, Dirac, or Majorana basis of
the Dirac algebra. To the best of this author’s knowledge, [34] was the ﬁrst instance where
this more streamlined method of conjugating spinors has been proposed.
In considering these two formalisms, one comes to notice that no ϵ-type object was
needed in the C⊗H case. Somehow, the complex conjugate i 7→−i automatically encoded
the information given by ϵ. It is natural to ask, then, why ϵ is necessary in the matrix-
and-column-vector formalism.
After comparing equations (3.16) and (3.17), one sees that ϵ was what was needed so
as to account for the complex conjugation of basis vectors. In the C ⊗H formalism, we
naturally take the complex conjugate of both the coeﬃcients, and the basis vectors. On
the other hand, there is no notion of complex conjugating basis vectors in the matrix-
and-column-vector formalism. The matrix ϵ needs to be introduced so as to account for
this. The conjugation of Weyl spinors, as explained here, then exposes a naturalness to
the purely algebraic formalism.
3.5.4
Majorana spinors as generalized ideals
Given our description above of Dirac spinors, it is now easy to build Majorana spinors.
Any Dirac spinor splits into two Majorana spinors, given by
ΨM1 ≡1
2 (ΨD + Ψ∗
D)
ΨM2 ≡1
2 (ΨD −Ψ∗
D) .
(3.20)
Clearly, ΨM1 is invariant under complex conjugation, Ψ∗
M1 = ΨM1, while ΨM2 acquires
a minus sign, Ψ∗
M2 = −ΨM2. The reader is encouraged to conﬁrm that ΨM1 and ΨM2
both constitute generalized ideals, and that mc(L, ΨM) gives their transformation under
SL(2, C).
To summarize, we have just found that left- and right-handed Weyl spinors, Dirac
spinors, and Majorana spinors are all simply generalized ideals of the same complex
invariant-action, mc.
Furthermore, in every case, their transformation under SL(2, C)
can be described succinctly as Ψ′ = mc(L, Ψ).
14

3.6
Hermitian invariant-action, mh
We will now ﬁnd that the hermitian invariant-action, mh, leads to new generalized ideals,
which behave like four-vectors,
b′ = a b a†.
(3.21)
Any element of C⊗H can be written as a sum of hermitian p ≡p0+p1iϵx+p2iϵy +p3iϵz
and anti-hermitian ˆp ≡iˆp0 + ˆp1ϵx + ˆp2ϵy + ˆp3ϵz parts, where the pn and ˆpn ∈R. As apa† is
hermitian and aˆpa† is antihermitian for any a ∈C ⊗H, it is clear that these two subspaces
form generalized ideals under the multiplication mh(a, b) = aba†.
Just as was done in the case for spinors, we may now set a = L, where L represents
elements of SL(2, C).
The hermitian element, p, transforms as p′ = LpL†.
Matching
components, one ﬁnds that under this transformation law, p transforms as a contravariant
four-vector under the Lorentz group, [40]. Taking the complex conjugate of p describes the
transformation a covariant four-vector, p∗′ = L∗p∗eL. It can be seen that the antihermitian
case for ˆp follows analogously.
As an example, let us consider the momentum p = p0 + p1iϵx + p2iϵy + p3iϵz under a
rotation about the z axis by an angle θ. This rotated momentum is given by
p′ = exp
 −θϵz
2

p exp
  θϵz
2

=
 cos θ
2 −ϵz sin θ
2

p
 cos θ
2 + ϵz sin θ
2

=
p0 + (p1 cos θ + p2 sin θ) iϵx + (p2 cos θ −p1 sin θ) iϵy + p3iϵz,
(3.22)
as expected.
From this example, readers may note that even though the object p = p0+p1iϵx+p2iϵy+
p3iϵz looks to have indices which are all tied oﬀ, it does not represent a Lorentz scalar. It
transforms as a four-vector. Furthermore, even though the coeﬃcients pµ have space-time
indices, they do not transform directly on their own. This is in contrast to objects in the
formalism of standard QFT, which would have real numbers, pµ, transforming under the
Lorentz group. Here, we have only the complete p = p0 +p1iϵx +p2iϵy +p3iϵz transforming
under the Lorentz group.
As shown in [40], scalars can be constructed between a covariant vector p and con-
travariant vector q, as
1
2 (pq + epq), which is simply the real part of pq.
Indeed, when
q = p∗, this gives p2
0 −p2
1 −p2
2 −p2
3.
15

In brief, we have just seen that four-vectors can be represented simply by generalized
ideals under the hermitian multiplicative action, mh. For the hermitian case, contravariant
four vectors transform as p′ = LpL†, and covariant four-vectors transform as p∗′ = L∗p∗eL,
where L represents and element of SL(2, C).
3.7
Quaternionic invariant-action, mq
Finally, we will now consider the quaternionic invariant-action, mq. This new action leads
to generalized ideals, which are more commonly known as Lorentz scalars, φ, and the ﬁeld
strength tensor, F,
b′ = a b ea.
(3.23)
C ⊗H can be partitioned once again, this time into subspaces of the form φ ∈C and
F = (F 32 + iF 01) ϵx + (F 13 + iF 02) ϵy + (F 21 + iF 03) ϵz, with F mn ∈R. As eφ = φ, and
eF = −F, it is clear that each of these two subspaces is closed under the multiplication
b′ = abea from any element a of the algebra. Hence, they each constitute generalized ideals
under mq.
Lorentz transformations on these two generalized ideals can be found, again, by replac-
ing a with L. For our scalar, φ, we have φ′ = LφeL. Since φ ∈C, it commutes with every
element in C ⊗H, and so φ′ = LφeL = LeLφ. It is then easily conﬁrmed that eL = L−1 ∀L,
so that φ is indeed a Lorentz scalar, φ′ = φ.
In [40] it is shown that the usual ﬁeld strength tensor is represented by F, which
transforms as F ′ = LF eL under the Lorentz group. F ∗= (B1 + iE1) ϵx + (B2 + iE2) ϵy +
(B3 + iE3) ϵz gives the ﬁeld strength Fµν, while F gives F µν.
Readers are referred to the upcoming Section 4.9, where the description of Fµν will be
extended so as to satisfy parity transformations, deﬁned there.
In summary, we have just seen that the Lorentz scalar, φ, and the ﬁeld strength tensor,
F, are simply generalized ideals under the quaternionic invariant-action, mq. These gen-
eralized ideals transform as φ′ = LφeL = φ and F ′ = LF eL under the Lorentz group, where
L represents an element of SL(2, C).
16

3.8
Bilinears
Bilinears and other scalars can now be built by combining the various ideal representations,
whose SL(2, C) factors, L, ﬁt together like lock and key. Noting that eL = L−1, let us
consider for example the real part of Ψ†
Li∂ΨL + Ψ†
Ri∂∗ΨR, where ∂≡∂t −iϵx ∂x −iϵy ∂y −
iϵz ∂z. Under a Lorentz transformation,

a ﬁxed space-time point, ΨDiˆ∂ΨD = Ψ†
Dβiγα∂αΨD, in the usual matrix-and-column-vector
formalism.
3.9
Summary
We have just found a set of generalized ideals, originating from three generalized notions
of multiplication, mc, mh, and mq. These generalized ideals led directly to left- and right-
handed Weyl spinors, Dirac spinors, and Majorana spinors, four-vectors, scalars, and the
ﬁeld strength tensor. This accounts for all of the Lorentz representations of the standard
model.
Furthermore, we found that Lorentz transformations can be described concisely by
b′ = m(L, b),
(3.25)
(or by b′ = m(L∗, b)). These results were obtained using nothing but the algebra C ⊗H
acting on itself.
In contrast to the usual matrix-and-column-vector formalism of QFT, we point out a
number of advantages oﬀered by the C ⊗H formalism:
17

* A compact way: b′ = m(L, b), to describe all of the Lorentz representations of the
standard model
* A seamless new way of conjugating Weyl spinors, using only the complex conjugate,
i 7→−i
* A minimalistic formalism, making use of just a single algebra acting on itself
* A conceptually new description of Lorentz representations as stable subspaces (general-
ized ideals) of an algebra.
* A possible explanation as to why higher spin states are not seen experimentally in
fundamental particle physics. Higher spin representations of the Lorentz group should be
naturally excluded here, if the representation exceeds the number of dimensions describable
by C ⊗H.
3.10
Outlook
It is plain to see that mc, mh, and mq each correspond to an involution of the C ⊗H
algebra. That is, mc corresponds to ∗, mh corresponds to †, and mq corresponds to ∼. The
complex quaternions, though, have more discrete symmetries available than is shown here,
and it would be interesting to see what could come from the corresponding constructions
of generalized ideals.
Another proposal is to take the concept of generalized multiplication further by con-
sidering generalized automorphisms. Just as automorphisms preserve the multiplicative
structure of an algebra, generalized automorphisms are deﬁned to preserve the general-
ized multiplicative structure of an algebra. These generalized automorphisms might then
qualify as valid candidates for gauge symmetries, in the context of R ⊗C ⊗H ⊗O.
Another interesting lead to consider is whether or not this work has a connection to
Connes’ non-commutative geometry, [22], [11], [9]. That is, the complex and/or hermitian
invariant-actions, mc and mh, introduced here seem to bear some resemblance to the Dirac
operators found there. Could the results presented here ﬁt into that formalism? If not,
could this work suggest admissible alterations to Connes’ axioms?
Yet another line of questioning, currently under investigation, is to see how these C⊗H
representations (and later, R ⊗C ⊗H ⊗O representations) relate to Jordan algebras.

Chapter 4
Cliﬀord algebras
4.1
Motivation
It is diﬃcult to ignore the presence of Cliﬀord algebras within elementary particle physics.
Cliﬀord algebras inevitably appear whenever spinors do, and ultimately underlie the alge-
bra of some well-known grand uniﬁed theories, [7]. It was in fact argued in [8], [13], and
[14] that Cliﬀord algebras alone are the source of internal structure for quarks and leptons.
But one may ask, where do these Cliﬀord algebras come from? Certainly, there is an
inﬁnite number of Cliﬀord algebras available, and nature appears to choose only some of
them. How does she make that choice?
The connection between the division algebras, R, C, H, O, and Cliﬀord algebras is
unmistakable.
In fact, Cliﬀord algebras were introduced in 1878 by William Kingdon
Cliﬀord as an extension of the quaternions, [15].
Later, in Section 6.3, we will show how the action of C⊗O on itself leads to the Cliﬀord
algebra Cl(6).
From this Cliﬀord algebra we will ultimately extract a one-generation
description of quarks and leptons, followed by some further indications of a three-generation
model.
4.2
Deﬁnition
In [39], [66], a Cliﬀord algebra over R is deﬁned to be an associative algebra, which is
generated by n elements, ei. These n generators exhibit the properties
19

{ei, ej} ≡eiej + ejei = 2ηijI,
(4.1)
where the entries ηij = 0 for i ̸= j, and ηii = ±1 ∀i. The symbol I represents the identity.
A Cliﬀord algebra over R with p generators having the property e2
i = +I, and q generators
having the property e2
i = −I, is referred to as Cl(p, q).
In this text, we will be interested mostly in Cliﬀord algebras over C, referred to as
Cl(n). Clearly, taking the algebra’s ﬁeld to be C, instead of R, erases the Cliﬀord algebra’s
signature, (p, q) 7→(n).
Complex Cliﬀord algebras, Cl(n), with even n, each have only one irreducible repre-
sentation. This irreducible representation has 2n/2 complex dimensions. For Cl(n) with
n odd, there are two inequivalent irreducible representations, each with 2(n−1)/2 complex
dimensions. In this thesis, we will be concerned mostly with Cl(n) for n even.
Below, we include a couple of helpful tables from [51], detailing how Cliﬀord algebras
may be faithfully represented by matrices over the rings R, C, H, 2R ≡R ⊕R, or 2H ≡
H ⊕H. Here, the notation A(d) refers to d × d matrices over the ring A.

Furthermore, for Cliﬀord algebras of larger p + q, we have the isomorphisms
Cl(p, q + 8) ≃Cl(p, q) ⊗R(16),
(4.2)
and similarly,
Cl(p + 8, q) ≃Cl(p, q) ⊗R(16).
(4.3)
20

On the other hand, for the case of complex Cliﬀord algebras, we have Cl(n) ≃C(2n/2) for
n even, and Cl(n) ≃2C(2(n−1)/2) for n odd.

Examples of Cliﬀord algebras from C ⊗H
Given the multiplication properties from equation (3.2), it is straightforward to see that
C ⊗H gives a representation of the real Cliﬀord algebra, Cl(3, 0). Please see Figure (4.1).

algebra’s zero-vector is 1, its generating vectors are iϵx and iϵy, its bivector is iϵxiϵy = −ϵz.
These multi-vectors are understood to be taken over C.
It was mentioned above that complex Cliﬀord algebras, Cl(n), each have just a single
irreducible representation when n is even, and have two inequivalent irreducible represen-
tations when n is odd. In the even case, that irreducible representation is 2n/2-complex-
dimensional, whereas, in the odd case, each of the two irreducible representations are
2(n−1)/2-complex-dimensional. These irreducible representations are commonly known as
spinors.
Consider the example of the complex quaternions acting on themselves from the left.
This action gives a representation of Cl(2), so that n = 2 in this case. We would then
expect a single 2n/2-complex-dimensional irreducible representation for that Cliﬀord alge-
bra. This irreducible representation is none other than the familiar 2-complex-dimensional
Weyl spinor.
4.4
Minimal left ideals
For the remainder of this text, we will be interested only in Cliﬀord algebras over C, where
n is even. The most common way to model these algebras is to represent them as 2n/2×2n/2
complex matrices, as mentioned above. These complex matrices then act on spinors in the
form of 2n/2-complex-dimensional column vectors.
We would like, however, to avoid resorting to this matrix-and-column-vector formalism,
which posits two separate entities: matrices, and column vectors. Instead, we will opt
22

for a more streamlined formalism, based simply on a single algebra acting on itself. The
motivation for such a formalism originates from the algebraic model sketched in Chapter 2.
It should not be surprising that this goal is an obtainable one. That is, there exist 2n/2-
complex-dimensional subalgebras within these Cliﬀord algebras, which serve as irreducible
representations. These subalgebras are called minimal left ideals, and provide one way of
deﬁning spinors, [1].
Given an algebra, A, a left ideal, B, is a subalgebra of A whereby ab is in B for all b in
B, and for any a in A. That is, no matter which a we multiply onto b, the new product,
b′ ≡ab, must be in the subspace B (i.e. the ideal B survives).
Now, a minimal left ideal is a left ideal which contains no other left ideals other than
{0} and itself.
4.5
How to identify minimal left ideals
We will now summarize for the reader a procedure for ﬁnding minimal left ideals in com-
plex Cliﬀord algebras, where n is even.
This procedure is described in [1], which also
accommodates other types of Cliﬀord algebra.
In the special case of C ⊗H, this procedure will allow us to recover the Weyl spinors
ΨL or ΨR, which we found earlier via the complex multiplicative action, mc. We will then
move on to the algebra of C ⊗O, which can be seen to generate Cl(6). This leads us to
minimal left ideals behaving as a full generation of quarks and leptons.
4.5.1
Some deﬁnitions
Let V be the vector space over a ﬁeld F. A quadratic form, Q, is a map Q : V →F such
that ∀v, w ∈V and λ ∈F,
Q(λv) = λ2Q(v)
(4.4)
and such that the map B : V × V →F,
B : (v, w) 7→Q(v + w) −Q(v) −Q(w)
(4.5)
is linear in both v and w. This V, together with its quadratic form, is called a quadratic
vector space.
23

We will be especially interested in the quadratic vector space given by V and Q, where
V is the n-dimensional vector space spanned by the generating elements ej of deﬁnition
(4.1). Here, the quadratic form will be given by Q(v) = {v, v}, and the corresponding
bilinear form is then B(v, w) = 2{v, w}. Note that V here is only the generating subspace
of our Cliﬀord algebra, it does not represent the entire Cliﬀord algebra.
A subspace U of V is said to be totally isotropic if B(αi, αj) = 0 ∀αi, αj ∈U. In
the following construction, we will be interested in maximal totally isotropic subspaces of
V , which are deﬁned to be totally isotropic subspaces of V with maximal dimension. As
explained in [1], for Cliﬀord algebras over C with n even, the dimension of any maximal
totally isotropic subspace will be n/2. In fact, we ﬁnd that the generating space splits into
exactly two maximal totally isotropic subspaces, each with the dimension n/2.
It is interesting to note that our maximal totally isotropic subspace, U of V, generates
a Grassmann algebra, seeing as how B(αi, αj) = 2{αi, αj} = 0 ∀αi, αj ∈U. This fact
merits notice, especially in consideration of recent work by L´aszl´o, [49].
4.5.2
Procedure
With these deﬁnitions in hand, the procedure for constructing minimal left ideals is
straightforward:
1.
First identify a quadratic vector space (V, Q) . In particular, we will take V to be
the generating space of a given Cliﬀord algebra, spanned by the generators {ej}
over C, where j = 1 . . . n. We will take our quadratic form to be Q(v) = {v, v}.
2.
Identify an MTIS (maximal totally isotropic subspace) U of V as the largest possible
subspace of V such that {αi, αj} = 0 ∀αi, αj ∈U.
3.
Deﬁne the nilpotent object Ω≡α1α2 · · · αn/2, where the αi are linearly independent
basis vectors of U.
4.
Construct the projector, ΩΩ†, where † takes i 7→−i, ej 7→−ej, and reverses the order
of multiplication.
5.
Left multiply the entire Cliﬀord algebra onto ΩΩ† to arrive at a minimal left ideal:
Cl(n)ΩΩ†.
24

It should be noted that the above is not the only way in which minimal left ideals may
be constructed; for details, please see [1].
The projector, ΩΩ†, is an example of a primitive idempotent. A primitive idempotent,
P, is deﬁned in [51] to be an idempotent (P 2 = P), which is not the sum of two annihilating
idempotents, P ̸= P1 + P2, where P1P2 = P2P1 = 0.
4.6
Minimal left ideals in C ⊗H
As a speciﬁc example, let us now build a minimal left ideal in C⊗H ≃Cl(2), as per Figure
(4.2). Following the procedure from Section (4.5.2),
1.
Our vector space, V, is spanned by the elements iϵx and iϵy over C. The quadratic form is
given by Q(v) = {v, v}.
2.
An MTIS of V is just one-complex-dimensional in this case, and can be spanned
by α1 = ϵ↓↑= 1
2 (ϵy + iϵx). (Another option would be ϵ↑↓= 1
2 (−ϵy + iϵx)).
3.
Since U is only one-dimensional here, the nilpotent object Ωis given simply by
Ω= α1 = ϵ↓↑.
4.
The primitive idempotent, ΩΩ†, is then ΩΩ† = ϵ↓↑ϵ↓↑† = ϵ↓↓.
5.
Our minimal left ideal is ﬁnally given by ΨR = C ⊗H ΩΩ† = ψ↑
R ϵ↑↓+ ψ↓
R ϵ↓↓.
Readers will notice that this minimal left ideal matches ΨR, found as a generalized ideal in
Section (3.5). Furthermore, redoing this procedure by taking the maximal totally isotropic
subspace to be instead spanned by ϵ↑↓yields the familiar ΨL = ψ↑
L ϵ↑↑+ψ↓
L ϵ↓↑from before.
So, we have just shown that we can use this procedure to build a left- or right-handed
Weyl spinor from the left action of C ⊗H on itself.
4.6.1
Fock space structure
With a little relabelling, it becomes obvious that these minimal left ideals naturally exhibit
Fock space structure. Taking α1 = ϵ↓↑, it then follows that α†
1 = ϵ↑↓, which have the
anticommutation relations,
25

{α1, α1} = {α†
1, α†
1} = 0
{α1, α†
1} = 1.
(4.6)
Deﬁning the (formal) vacuum states to be v ≡ΩΩ† and v∗≡Ω†Ωfor ΨR and ΨL, respec-
tively, we have
ΨR = ψ↑
R ϵ↑↓+ ψ↓
R ϵ↓↓= ψ↑
R α†
1v + ψ↓
R v
(4.7)
ΨL = ψ↑
L ϵ↑↑+ ψ↓
L ϵ↓↑= ψ↑
L v∗+ ψ↓
L α1v∗.
(4.8)
That is, α†
1 acts as a raising operator from the vacuum v within ΨR, and α∗†
1 = −α1 acts
as a raising operator from the vacuum v∗within ΨL. It should be clear to the reader that
v and v∗represent vacua only in an algebraic sense, and are not meant to represent the
zero-particle state.
Such Fock space structure will reappear in other constructions, for example, when we
build minimal left ideals from the algebra C ⊗O. Moreover, it comes up again in the work
of L´aszl´o, [49].
4.7
The Dirac algebra
It is not enough for us here to consider minimal left ideals for just ΨL or for just ΨR,
separately. We would like also to combine these two objects together into a single four-
complex-dimensional Dirac spinor, as shown in Section 3.5.2.
It had been mentioned earlier that chirality, L and R, is the analogue of spin, ↑and
↓, in this formalism. One can conﬁrm that left multiplying ΨL and ΨR by C ⊗H causes
rotation between their spin states, ↑and ↓, whereas right multiplying ΨL and ΨR by C⊗H
causes rotation between L and R.
The left action and right action of C ⊗H on itself each give a representation of Cl(2).
Furthermore, taking ℓ, a, r ∈C ⊗H, one can easily show that ℓa = ar ∀a ⇒ℓ, r ∈C ⊂
C ⊗H. That is, the left action of C ⊗H on itself cannot be re-expressed as the right
action of C ⊗H on itself, and vice versa. It is a property of C ⊗H that these two actions
are distinct, a feature which does not appear in the case of C ⊗O. Furthermore, the
associativity of C ⊗H ensures that the left and right action commute with each other.
26

Hence, the underlying Cliﬀord algebraic structure when considering both left and right
multiplication of C ⊗H on itself is Cl(2) ⊗C Cl(2), where the tensor product is over C.
As Cl(n)⊗C Cl(2) ≃Cl(n+2) for n ∈Z ≥0, we then ﬁnd that Cl(2)⊗C Cl(2) ≃Cl(4).
Furthermore, as the complexiﬁcation of a real Cliﬀord algebra, Cl(p, q) acts to erase its
signature, C ⊗Cl(p, q) ≃Cl(p + q), we then ﬁnd that Cl(4) ≃C ⊗Cl(1, 3).
In other words, the left and right action of C ⊗H on itself gives a representation of the
Dirac algebra.
It is straightforward for readers to conﬁrm this fact. Explicitly, the gamma matrices
γ0, γ1, γ2, and γ3, written in the Weyl basis, have the following correspondences in C ⊗H:
γ0 =
 0
I
I
0

7→1 | iϵx
γ1 =

7→iϵy | ϵy
γ3 =

0
σz
−σz
0

7→iϵz | ϵy.
(4.9)
These ﬁndings are likely to appear in future joint work with G. Fiore from INFN.
Here, we make use of the bar notation from earlier authors, [50]. By deﬁnition, the
operator a | b acting on some element c, for a, b, c ∈C ⊗H, is given simply by acb. As an
example, consider the object corresponding to γ0 acting on ΨD ∈C ⊗H,
1 ΨD iϵx = 1 (ΨL + ΨR) iϵx
=

ψ↑
L ϵ↑↑+ ψ↓
L ϵ↓↑+ ψ↑

R ϵ↑↑+ ψ↓
R ϵ↓↑+ ψ↑
L ϵ↑↓+ ψ↓

.
(4.10)
This ﬂips chirality, as one would expect.
From these operators, an object corresponding to γ5 ≡iγ0γ1γ2γ3 can be found to be
γ5 =
 −I
0
0
I

7→−1 | iϵz.
(4.11)
This thereby conﬁrms the role of P and P ∗as 1
2 (1 ∓γ5), introduced early on in equa-
tion (3.5).
27

More generally, it can now be seen that ΨD = ΨL + ΨR introduced previously, does in
fact behave as a Dirac spinor, acted upon by a complex quaternionic representation of the
Dirac algebra, C ⊗Cl(1, 3).
4.8
Right action required
Readers may have noticed that the left action of C⊗H on itself was not enough to describe
ΨL + ΨR together as a single irreducible representation. That is, the left action alone has
only ΨL (or ΨR) as an irrep. However, the combined Dirac spinor, ΨL + ΨR, does become
an irreducible representation of a Cliﬀord algebra when the right action of C ⊗H is also
included. Readers will ﬁnd this theme coming up again in future chapters.
4.9
Parity and the ﬁeld strength tensor
The work in this section is to appear in a joint paper, together with G. Fiore from INFN.
In Section 3.6, we introduced four-vectors, p, as generalized ideals under the hermitian
invariant-action, mh. These can be described as
p = p0 + p1iϵx + p2iϵy + p3iϵz,
(4.12)
which transform under the Lorentz group as p′ = mh(L, p) = LpL†, for L ∈SL(2, C).
Furthermore, in Section 3.7, we introduced the ﬁeld strength tensor, F, as a generalized
ideal under the quaternionic invariant-action, mq. Explicitly, we had
F = (B1 −iE1) ϵx + (B2 −iE2) ϵy + (B3 −iE3) ϵz,
(4.13)
which transforms under the Lorentz group as F ′ = mq(L, F) = LF eL. Of course, we also
studied spinors and scalars in previous sections, but these will not be relevant for us at the
moment.
Given these two Lorentz representations, we might wonder how parity transformations
are to be carried out. Under a parity transformation, we would expect
28

p
7→
p′ = p0 −p1iϵx −p2iϵy −p3iϵz,
F
7→
F ′ = (B1 + iE1) ϵx + (B2 + iE2) ϵy + (B3 + iE3) ϵz.
(4.14)
Now, it might be tempting to consider the quaternionic conjugate as the parity conju-
gate, since eϵx = −ϵx, eϵy = −ϵy, and eϵz = −ϵz. However, the quaternionic conjugate sends
F 7→−F, which does not give the desired result: Ei 7→−Ei, and Bj 7→Bj. So how might
we deﬁne a parity transformation?
In Section 4.7, we demonstrated a representation of the Dirac algebra, C ⊗Cl(1, 3),
using both left and right multiplication of C ⊗H on itself. From this Cliﬀord algebra, it is
then possible to deﬁne a parity transformation:
γ0 7→γ0 = 1 | iϵx,
γj
7→−γj = −iϵj | ϵy,
(4.15)
for j = 1, 2, 3.
So, the question is now: how do we use this parity transformation on the γµ to induce
a parity transformation on p and F?
The resolution to this question is not obvious, because p and F are objects which are
derived from C ⊗H ≃Cl(2) structure, while the γµ belong in (C ⊗H) ⊗C (C ⊗H) ≃
C ⊗Cl(1, 3) ≃Cl(4). One solution, which we will now show, is to generalize the Cl(2)
objects, p and F, to two new Cl(4) operators, ˆp and ˆF. We might hope, then, that under
the right conditions, ˆp and ˆF would reduce to p and F. In summary, we would like to
see the parity transformations on ˆp and ˆF, given by equation 4.15, automatically induce
parity transformations on p and F.
Let us then deﬁne ˆp to be
ˆp ≡pµγµ = p0 1 | iϵx + pj iϵj | ϵy,
(4.16)
for pµ ∈R, for µ = 0, 1, 2, 3, and j = 1, 2, 3. This is none other than the usual pµγµ of
quantum ﬁeld theory.
Making use of the Cliﬀord algebraic description of [51], let us deﬁne ˆF to be
ˆF ≡Fµνγµν = F0iγ0i + Fjkγjk = Ei ϵi | ϵz −Bj ϵj | 1,
(4.17)
for µ, ν = 0, 1, 2, 3, Fµν ∈R, γµν ≡1
2 [γµ, γν], and i, j = 1, 2, 3.
29

It is then trivial to see that under a parity transformation given by
γ0 7→γ0 = 1 | iϵx,
γj
7→−γj = −iϵj | ϵy,
(4.18)
for j = 1, 2, 3, the operator, ˆp transforms as
ˆp 7→
ˆp′ = p0 1 | iϵx −pj iϵj | ϵy,
(4.19)
and the operator, ˆF transforms as
ˆF
7→
ˆF ′ = −Ei ϵi | ϵz −Bj ϵj | 1,
(4.20)
as we would expect.
So, we have a new description for four-momenta, ˆp, and the ﬁeld strength tensor, ˆF,
which transform as they should under parity. We would now like to know how these relate
to the generalized ideals, p and F that we found earlier in Sections 3.6 and 3.7.
We ﬁnd that the operators ˆp and ˆF reduce to the generalized ideals p and F, when ˆp
and ˆF are taken to be operators, acting on spinors in C ⊗H. Incorporating the object γ0,
we ﬁnd that ˆp reduces to p, or p∗, on Weyl spinors,
γ0ˆp ΨL = p∗ΨL,
γ0ˆp ΨR = p ΨR.
(4.21)
Similarly, we ﬁnd that ˆF reduces to F, or F ∗, on Weyl spinors as
ˆF ΨL = −F ∗ΨL,
ˆF ΨR = −F ΨR.
(4.22)
Readers may note that a parity transformation on ˆp and ˆF now automatically induces the
correct parity transformation on p and F, when these objects are taken to be operators on
spinors.
Finally, we point out that this deﬁnition of parity,
γ0 7→γ0 = 1 | iϵx,
γj
7→−γj = −iϵj | ϵy,
(4.23)
sends γ5 7→−γ5, so that left- and right-handed Weyl spinors are swapped under this
transformation, as we would expect.
30

In summary, we have shown that the parity conjugate of the C⊗Cl(1, 3) ≃(C ⊗H)⊗C
(C ⊗H) algebra may be used to induce a parity conjugate on our generalized ideals in
C ⊗H.
Note that we have also demonstrated a way to write down four-vectors, and the ﬁeld
strength tensor, in the Dirac algebra formalism, which makes use of the generalized ideals
found in Sections 3.6 and 3.7. Namely,
ˆp ΨD = γ0 mc(p∗, ΨD),
ˆF ΨD = mc(−F ∗, ΨD).

Chapter 5
Standard model of particle physics
5.1
What it is
The standard model of particle physics is the result of decades of collaboration, which
began roughly in the 1930s, and converged ﬁnally on its current state in 1979, [62]. It is a
mosaic of our best eﬀorts in particle physics over that half century. In the decades since
1979, the standard model has seen little in the way of alterations, and yet has survived
rigorous experimental testing, nearly completely unscathed.
A brief history: In 1928, P.A.M. Dirac set up the foundations for quantum electro-
dynamics (QED), which was later generalized to incorporate the neutrino by E. Fermi,
[62]. Feynman, Schwinger, and Tomonaga subsequently developed renormalization theory
for QED, [46]. In the mid-1950s, M. Gell-Mann proposed strangeness as a new quantum
number, while T.D. Lee and C. N. Yang suggested methods for detecting parity violation
of the weak force. In that same decade, the W boson was suggested as a mediator of the
weak force, following the work of C.N. Yang and R.L. Mills, [62].
In the 1960s, G. Zweig, and independently, M. Gell-Mann, proposed that subatomic
particles (now known as quarks) were the constituents of baryonic matter. Electroweak
theory was developed by S. Glashow, A. Salam, J.C. Ward, and S. Weinberg, in that same
decade, [62]. A mechanism to impart mass on gauge bosons was then proposed by three
groups independently: ﬁrst of all, R. Brout and F. Englert, then, P.W. Higgs, and ﬁnally
G. Guralnik, C. R. Hagen, and T. Kibble, all in 1964, [46]. In 1971, G. ’t Hooft showed
that the Glashow-Salam-Ward-Weinberg electroweak model was renormalizable, [65]. M.
Gell-Mann, H. Fritzsch, and H. Leutwyler’s work in the 1970s resulted in what we know
32

as quantum chromodynamics (QCD). For a more detailed history of the standard model,
readers are encouraged to consult [62].
The particle content of the standard model can be characterized by labelling parti-
cles according to how they transform under the standard model’s gauge group, SU(3)c ×
SU(2)L×U(1)Y . (More accurately, the standard model’s gauge group is SU(3)c×SU(2)L×
U(1)Y /Z6, which will be discussed in Chapter 8.) Here, Y stands for weak hypercharge,
and we will be using the weak hypercharge conventions found in [12]. Readers may note
the rather arbitrary-looking collection of hypercharges displayed below.

The standard model is believed to be largely valid over a vast range of scales, from
the Hubble radius, 1030cm, down to subatomic scales of 10−16cm, [62]. It has successfully
predicted the existence of a number of particles, including for example, the W and Z
bosons, [48], the top quark, tau-neutrino, [62], and most recently, the Higgs boson, [19],
[18], [17], [16].
34

Given the striking complexity of our known universe, it is hard to believe that so much
of it can be described by such a short list of elementary particles. Beyond its particle
content, the standard model also has a relatively concise list of free parameters, 19 of
them, whereby 13 come from the Yukawa sector, 2 from the Higgs sector, 3 from gauge
couplings, and 1 from an apparently absent QCD term, [53], [64].
5.2
What it is not
If the standard model is to be faulted for anything, that fault would lie almost exclusively
in its incompleteness. The ﬁrst legitimate fracture in the standard model came with the
discovery of neutrino oscillations, which imply that neutrinos do indeed have mass, [53].
Having said that, the standard model is easily amended to accommodate massive neutrinos,
albeit, at the expense of having to accept a number of additional free parameters in the
theory.
In the absence of any major conﬂict with experiment, much criticism of the standard
model is based in the theory’s apparent inability to go beyond.
The standard model
does not explain dark matter, nor dark energy. Nor, does it describe baryon asymmetry.
Furthermore, the standard model has consistently deﬁed uniﬁcation with gravity.
5.3
What it should be
One might not criticize the standard model too harshly, for simply remaining silent about
many of the open problems in physics. However, what is less benign is that the standard
model does at times account for various aspects of nature, and yet fails to explain them.
For example, the standard model singles out a particular gauge group, SU(3)c ×
SU(2)L × U(1)Y /Z6, yet does not explain where this group came from. It further speciﬁes
a list of particle representations for this group, Section 5.1, without explaining why these
representations were chosen over any other possible set. The standard model does not
explain why those representations are organized into three generations. It does not explain
why SU(2)L acts on left-handed spinors, but not on right-handed spinors. It does not
explain the apparently ad hoc arrangement of hypercharges. Furthermore, the standard
model does not explain the values of its 19 parameters.
Perhaps the gaps in our understanding could be attributed to the patchwork way in
which the standard model came to be. One might argue that what is needed is some form
35

of unifying principles to smooth over the seams. These unifying principles might come in
the form of grand uniﬁed theories, supersymmetry, M-theory, or perhaps something else.

Chapter 6
One generation of quarks and leptons
from C ⊗O
In Chapter 3, we saw how a four-complex-dimensional algebra, C⊗H, supplies an unusually
compact description of all the Lorentz representations of the standard model. However,
there is more to the standard model than just the Lorentz group. Beyond spin and chirality,
standard model fermions also exhibit colour, weak isospin, and charge. Could these physical
features also be the result of some algebra acting on itself? If so, which one?
In our work with C ⊗H, the reader may have noticed the trivial identity,
C ⊗H = R ⊗C ⊗H.
(6.1)
That is, the algebra we have dealt with up until now is the tensor product of three of the
four division algebras. It is then only natural to ask, what about R ⊗C ⊗H ⊗O? The
octonionic algebra, O, possesses eight degrees of freedom, and it is diﬃcult not to notice: so
does a generation of quarks and leptons. (Neutrino, charged lepton, three up-type quarks
and three down-type quarks).
Despite its counter-culture status, the octonions have long drawn the curiosity of gen-
erations of physicists.
The algebra is known to appear without warning in apparently
disparate areas of mathematics, within algebra, geometry, and topology. However, de-
spite its ubiquity, its practical uses in physics have remained elusive, due to the algebra’s
non-associativity, which must be handled with care. In the following chapters, we aim to
demonstrate to the reader that the octonions’ non-associativity is not a impediment, but
37

instead a gift, and that this misunderstood algebra is really at the heart of the standard
model of particle physics.
The ﬁndings which we will now describe make a case in support of those who have
been long advocating for the existence of a connection between non-associative algebras
and particle theory, [41], [42], [63], [56], [26], [27], [34], [35], [36], [11], [3], [2] [5], [6], [43],
[44], [54], [8], [13].
One of the earliest breakthroughs along these lines belong to G¨unaydin and G¨ursey, [41],
who showed SU(3)c quark structure in the split octonions. Later, in [42], they showed anti-
commuting ladder operators within that model. Our new results stem from the octonionic
chromodynamic quark model of [42], and are meant to replace the provisional charges of
[34].
In the following pages, we will extend G¨unaydin and G¨ursey’s ﬁndings of quark structure
under SU(3)c by further demonstrating
1. lepton structure and
2. a natural U(1)em symmetry.
In other words, using only the complex octonions, we will complete the particle content of
the model to include a full generation of quarks and leptons, under not only SU(3)c, but
under both of the standard model’s two unbroken gauge symmetries.
6.1
A summary of the results to come
Using only the algebra of the complex octonions, which we will introduce, we expose an
intrinsic structure to a generation of quarks and leptons. This algebraic structure mimics
familiar quantum systems, which have a vacuum state acted upon by raising and lowering
operators. In this case, the neutrino poses as the vacuum state, and electrons and quarks
pose as the excited states. These results are simply the analogue of the Fock space we
found earlier in Section 4.6.1.
With these raising and lowering operators in hand, we are then able to construct a
number operator in the usual way,
N =
X
i
α†
iαi.
(6.2)
It will be seen that N has eigenvalues given by {0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3}. At ﬁrst sight, these
eigenvalues might not look familiar, that is, until they are divided by 3. N/3 has eigenvalues
38

{0, 1
3, 1
3, 1
3, 2
3, 2
3, 2
3, 1}, which can now be recognized as the electric charges of a neutrino
(or anti-neutrino), a triplet of anti-down quarks, a triplet of up quarks, and a positron.
We will then deﬁne our electric charge, Q, as
Q ≡N
3 .
(6.3)
As N must take on integer values, Q must be quantized. Hence, the model oﬀers at this
early stage a straightforward explanation for the quantization of electric charge.
As we will show, the remaining states within a generation are related to these particles
by complex conjugation, and hence are acted upon by −Q∗in the usual way.
The anti-commuting ladder operators, mentioned above, can be seen to possess a certain
symmetry generated uniquely by su(3)c and u(1)em, the two unbroken symmetries of the
standard model. These generators of SU(3)c do indeed match those of [41], and ﬁt in
perfectly with Q, the U(1)em generator mentioned above. Under these symmetries, we
ﬁnd that our Fock space, and its complex conjugate, together transform as would a full
generation of quarks and leptons.
Ours is certainly not the ﬁrst instance where G¨unaydin and G¨ursey’s model has been
adapted. As an extension of their model, [26], [27], Dixon describes electric charge as
a mix of quaternionic and octonionic objects. It would be interesting to see if a ladder
system could be found, which alternately gives Dixon’s Q as a number operator. Readers
are encouraged to see [26], [27], or other examples of his extensive work.
Since the time of ﬁrst writing, more octonionic chromo-electrodynamic models have
been found.
Most noteworthy of all were three papers written in the late 1970s, [8],
[13], and [14], which could also be considered as extensions of G¨unaydin and G¨ursey’s
model, [42]. In these papers, the authors use two separate ladder systems: system (a)
ﬁts with the octonionic ladder operators of [42], and system (b) is introduced as quater-
nionic. By combining the two systems, they describe the electric charge generator not as a
number operator, but as the diﬀerence between the number operators of the two systems.
References [8], [13], and [14] are important papers, worth careful reconsideration by the
community.
Our results diﬀer from earlier versions in that we will be constructing a generation of
quarks and leptons explicitly as minimal left ideals of a Cliﬀord algebra, generated only
by the complex octonions. In doing so, we will use just a single octonionic ladder system,
with its complex conjugate. This in turn allows us to deﬁne electric charge more simply
as Q = N/3, thereby exposing a more direct route to the two unbroken gauge symmetries
39

of the standard model. Furthermore, our formalism naturally relates particles and anti-
particles using only the complex conjugate, i 7→−i, which is not a feature of these earlier
models. Finally, as our generation of quarks and leptons will be constructed from Cliﬀord
algebra elements, not column vectors, we will then be free to model weak isospin, using
right multiplication of this same Cliﬀord algebra onto these minimal left ideals.
6.2
Introduction to C ⊗O
The complex octonions are not a tool commonly used in physics, so we introduce them
here.
The generic element of C ⊗O is written P7
n=0 Anen, where the An are complex coeﬃ-
cients. The en are octonionic imaginary units (e2
n = −1), apart from e0 = 1, which multiply
according to Figure 6.1. The complex imaginary unit i commutes with the octonionic en.

Figure 6.1:
Multiplication of octonionic imaginary units
Any three imaginary units on a directed line segment in Figure 6.1 act as if they were
a triplet of Pauli matrices, σm. (More precisely, they behave as −iσm.) For example,
e6e1 = −e1e6 = e5, e1e5 = −e5e1 = e6, e5e6 = −e6e5 = e1, e4e1 = −e1e4 = e2, etc.
The multiplication rules for these imaginary units can be deﬁned by setting e1e2 = e4,
and then applying the following rules, as shown in [4].
40

eiej = −ejei
i ̸= j,
eiej = ek
⇒ei+1ej+1 = ek+1,
eiej = ek
⇒e2ie2j = e2k.
(6.4)
It is indeed true that the octonions form a non-associative algebra, meaning that the
relation (ab)c = a(bc) does not always hold. The reader can check this by ﬁnding three
imaginary units, which are not all on the same line segment, and substituting them as in
a, b, and c.
The octonionic automorphism group is G2, which is a 14-dimensional exceptional Lie
group. Its Lie algebra may be represented by the generators

acting on the octonions. Here, the nested brackets indicate that the generators are con-
structed from chains of octonions, multiplying from right to left.
The eight objects, Λi, generate SU(3) ⊂G2.
This SU(3) may be deﬁned as the
subgroup of G2 which leaves the octonionic unit e7 invariant. Of course, alternate SU(3)
subgroups of G2 may be found, which correspond to other imaginary units. For a more
thorough introduction of O see [4], [23], [56].
Finally, we deﬁne three notions of conjugation on an element a in C ⊗O. The complex
conjugate of a, denoted a∗, maps the complex i 7→−i, as would be expected. The octonionic
conjugate of a, denoted ˜a, takes each of the octonionic imaginary units en 7→−en for
n = 1, . . . 7. That which we will call the hermitian conjugate of a, denoted a†, performs
both of these maps simultaneously, i 7→−i and en 7→−en for n = 1, . . . 7. The conjugate
41

and the hermitian conjugate each reverse the order of multiplication, as is familiar from
the hermitian conjugate of a product of matrices.
6.3
Octonionic chain algebra
As a non-associative algebra, the octonions can at times seem temperamental. Equations
involving this algebra can quickly become unwieldy, due to the need to repeatedly specify
the order of multiplication, by use of brackets. The assumptions we are accustomed to
making in associative algebras now do not always apply, and one might be led to wonder
how (associative) groups can be described with the (non-associative) octonions.
In this section, however, we explain how this is not the conundrum that it might seem
to be.
Every multiplication between two octonions can be considered as a linear map
of one octonion on the other. As maps are associative by deﬁnition, this gives a way of
re-describing the action of octonions as an associative algebra.
It is plain to see that left-multiplying one complex octonion, m, onto another, f, pro-
vides a map from f ∈C ⊗O to f ′ ≡mf ∈C ⊗O. Subsequently left-multiplying by
another complex octonion, n, provides another map: f 7→f ′′ ≡n(mf).
We will call
this map ←−
nm, where the arrow is in place so as to indicate the order in which multiplica-
tion occurs. We may extend the chain further by left-multiplying by p ∈C ⊗O, giving
←−−
pnm : f 7→p(n(mf)), and so on.
In an associative algebra, A, the exercise of building up chains in order to make new
maps would be futile. That is, for m1, m2, f in an associative algebra, m2(m1f) can always
be summarized as (m2m1)f = m′f, where m′ ≡m2m1 ∈A. However, as the complex
octonions form a non-associative algebra, building chains does in fact lead to new maps.
For example, consider the map ←−−
e3e4 acting on f = (e6 + ie2).
←−−
e3e4 (e6 + ie2) = e3 (e4 (e6 + ie2)) = −1 + ie7.
(6.6)
This is not the same as
(e3e4) (e6 + ie2) = (e6) (e6 + ie2) = −1 −ie7,
(6.7)
and in fact there exists no a ∈C ⊗O such that ←−−
e3e4 (e6 + ie2) = a (e6 + ie2).
42

Addition and multiplication are easy to deﬁne on this set of chains; we will refer to
the resulting algebra as the complex octonionic chain algebra, C ⊗←−
O, or simply the chain
algebra for short. Addition of two maps N = ←−−−−−−
· · · n3n2n1 and P = ←−−−−−−
· · · p3p2p1 ∈C ⊗←−
O on
f is given by [N + P] f = Nf + Pf, where the ni and pj ∈C ⊗O. Multiplication, ◦, is
given simply by the composition of maps,
[P ◦N] f = P(N(f)) = ←−−−−−−−−−−−−−−
· · · p3p2p1 · · · n3n2n1f.
(6.8)
As the composition of maps is always associative, C ⊗←−
O is an associative algebra. Un-
convinced readers are encouraged to check explicitly that [[A ◦B] ◦C] f = [A ◦[B ◦C]] f
∀A, B, C ∈C ⊗←−
O and ∀f ∈C ⊗O.
In analogy with the C ⊗O case, three notions of conjugation can be deﬁned on C ⊗←−
O.
Here, the complex conjugate is the same as before: i 7→−i.
For the octonionic and
hermitian conjugates, the deﬁnition is also the same as for the C⊗O case, bearing in mind
that these conjugates now reverse the order of the chain algebra’s multiplication, ◦.
Looking more closely at the chains, we notice quickly that
←−−−−−−−
· · · eaeb · · ·f = −←−−−−−−−
· · · ebea · · ·f
∀f ∈C ⊗O,
(6.9)
for a, b = 1, 2, . . . 7, when a ̸= b. Furthermore,
←−−−−−−−−−
· · · eiejejek · · ·f = −←−−−−−−
· · · eiek · · ·f
∀f ∈C ⊗O,
(6.10)
when i, k = 0, 1, 2, . . . 7 and j = 1, 2, . . . 7. With these properties, the chains acting on C⊗O
provide a representation of the Cliﬀord algebra Cl(7), where {i←−
e1, i←−
e2, . . . i←−
e7}, acting on
f, forms the generating set of vectors, [4].
It turns out, though, that C ⊗←−
O does not give a faithful representation of Cl(7).
There exists an additional symmetry, which identiﬁes two monomial chains with the same
map. For example, ←−−−
e1e2e3f = −←−−−−−
e4e5e6e7f, ←−−
e5e7f = −←−−−−−−
e1e2e3e4e6f, ←−
e7f = ←−−−−−−−−
e1e2e3e4e5e6f,
etc. These 64 equations (duality relations) are readily found by making use of equations
(6.9) and (6.10), and also the following form of the identity: ←−
e0f = −←−−−−−−−−−
e1e2e3e4e5e6e7f. We
then see that any element of C ⊗←−
O may be represented as a complex linear combination
of chains, of no more than three ejs in length.
The reader is encouraged to check that C ⊗←−
O faithfully represents the 64-complex-
dimensional Cliﬀord algebra Cl(6), generated by the set {i←−
e1, i←−
e2, . . . i←−
e6}, acting on f.
43

Figure (6.2) depicts the complex octonionic chain algebra, organized so as to demonstrate
its Cl(6) structure. Starting from the bottom, we have the zero-vector, 1 acting on f, the
generating vectors, {i←−
e1, i←−
e2, . . . i←−
e6} acting on f, the bivectors, {←−−
e1e2, . . . ←−−
e5e6} acting on
f, and so on. Note that we make regular use the identity ←−
e7f = ←−−−−−−−−
e1e2e3e4e5e6f so as to
avoid writing long chains of multivectors involving only the generators i←−
e1, i←−
e2, . . . i←−
e6.
For readers more comfortable with matrices and column vectors, one may loosely think
of C⊗←−
O as a space of 8×8 complex matrices, whereas the elements, f, would be represented
by 8-complex-dimensional column vectors.

Figure 6.2: The 64-complex-dimensional octonionic chain algebra gives a representation of
Cl(6). This octonionic chain algebra is a space of maps acting through left multiplication
onto any element f ∈C ⊗O.
44

Now that we have described octonionic left multiplication, by making use of an associa-
tive algebra, one might wonder if we have lost something by neglecting right multiplication.
It turns out, though, that unlike in the C ⊗H case, every complex octonion multiplied
from the right may be re-expressed as a sum of chains of octonions, multiplying from the
left,
fm = c0f +

(6.11)
for f, m ∈C⊗O, and for some c0, ci, cij, cijk ∈C. In other words, these right-multiplication
maps are already accounted for by C ⊗←−
O.
Finally, one might ask, if we are moving to a Cliﬀord algebraic description of octonionic
multiplication via Cl(6) anyway, why not just start with Cl(6) in the ﬁrst place? The
answer to this question is two-fold. First of all, in starting only from Cliﬀord algebras,
one would be hard-pressed to know which Cliﬀord algebras to choose. That is, an inﬁnite
number of Cliﬀord algebras exist, and there appears to be no reason to choose one over
any other.
Secondly, with an octonionic description of Cl(6), we will be able to map
particles into ant-particles, and vice versa, using only the complex conjugate, i 7→−i.
This is typically not the case when Cliﬀord algebras are expressed as matrices with complex
components, as was already shown in the C ⊗H ≃Cl(2) case of Section 3.5.3 for left- and
right- handed Weyl spinors.
6.4
A system of ladder operators
With the algebra C ⊗←−
O in hand, we can now set out to ﬁnd a system of ladder operators
within the octonionic chain algebra. Consider α1 ≡1
2 (−e5 + ie4), α2 ≡1
2 (−e3 + ie1) , and
α3 ≡1
2 (−e6 + ie2), similar to that deﬁned in [41]. For all f in C ⊗O, and assuming right-
to-left multiplication, these three lowering operators obey the anticommutation relations
{αi, αj}f = αi(αjf) + αj(αif) = 0
(6.12)
for all i, j = 1, 2, 3. The above can be seen as a generalization of the system in [42]. That
is, [42] is recovered by restricting the general f in C ⊗O to f = 1.
In another slight deviation from [42], we deﬁne raising operators as α†
1 = 1
2 (e5 + ie4),
α†
2 = 1
2 (e3 + ie1) , and α†
3 = 1
2 (e6 + ie2), which obey
45

{α†
i, α†
j}f = 0
for all i, j = 1, 2, 3.
(6.13)
We ﬁnally also have
{αi, α†
j}f = δijf
for all i, j = 1, 2, 3.
(6.14)
With the purpose simplifying notation, we will now implicitly assume all multiplication
to be carried out starting at the right, and moving to the left, as was shown in equa-
tion (6.12). That is, we will now not write these brackets in explicitly, nor will we include
an arrow going from right to left, specifying the direction of multiplication.
Furthermore, we will now be concerned only with operators, such as the αi, as opposed
to the object f. This being the case, it will now be understood that all equations will hold
over all f in C ⊗O, even though f will not be mentioned explicitly. For example, we will
now write equation (6.12) simply as
{αi, αj} = αiαj + αjαi = 0
for all i, j = 1, 2, 3.
(6.15)
As mentioned earlier, these operators acting on f may be viewed as 8 × 8 complex
matrices acting on f, an eight-complex-dimensional column vector. Taking into account
the above paragraph, our equations from here on in can be considered as relations only
between the matrices.
Another way of restating the above is to say that the operators are simply elements of
C ⊗←−
O, and we will be considering only the elements of C ⊗←−
O from here on in.
6.5
Complex conjugation’s analogue
Under complex conjugation, we ﬁnd an analogous ladder system. Consider α∗
1 = 1
2 (−e5 −ie4),
α∗
2 = 1
2 (−e3 −ie1) , and α∗
3 = 1
2 (−e6 −ie2). These three lowering operators obey the an-
ticommutation relations
{α∗
i , α∗
j} = 0
for all i, j = 1, 2, 3.
(6.16)
We deﬁne raising operators as ˜α1 = 1
2 (e5 −ie4), ˜α2 = 1
2 (e3 −ie1) , and ˜α3 = 1
2 (e6 −ie2),
which obey
46

{˜αi, ˜αj} = 0
for all i, j = 1, 2, 3.
(6.17)
Finally, we have also
{α∗
i , ˜αj} = δij
for all i, j = 1, 2, 3.
(6.18)
Using these ladder operators, we will now build minimal left ideals, which can be seen
to mimic the set of quarks and leptons of the standard model.
6.6
Minimal left ideals
We are now proposing to represent quarks and leptons using minimal left ideals within our
space of octonionic operators, C ⊗←−
O ≃Cl(6). That is, within the space of the αi, α†
j, and
their products. A pair of these ideals, Su and Sd, will be constructed using our procedure
from Section 4.5.2:
1.
Our vector space, V, is spanned by the elements ie1, ie2, . . . ie6 over C, in keeping
with Figure 6.2. The quadratic form is given by Q(v) = {v, v}.
2.
An MTIS of V is three-complex-dimensional in this case, and can be spanned
by α1 = 1
2 (−e5 + ie4), α2 = 1
2 (−e3 + ie1) , and α3 = 1
2 (−e6 + ie2).
3.
Our nilpotent object is then given by ω ≡α1α2α3.
4.
This leads to the primitive idempotent, ωω† = α1α2α3α†
3α†
2α†
1.
5.
Our minimal left ideal is ﬁnally given by Su ≡C ⊗←−
O ωω†, below.
The eight-complex-dimensional minimal left ideal for the ﬁrst ladder system is given
by
47

Su ≡
V ωω†

1ωω†

¯Dg α†
2ωω†

E+ α†
3α†
2α†
1ωω†,
(6.19)
where V, ¯Dr, . . . E+ are 8 suggestively named complex coeﬃcients.
As
αi ωω† = 0
∀i,
(6.20)
ωω† plays the role of the vacuum state, where the term vacuum is used loosely. Again,
it is not to be interpreted as a zero-particle state. However, readers may recognize the
similarity between Su and a Fock space.
The conjugate system of Section 6.5 analogously leads to
Sd ≡
¯V ω†ω
Dr α1ω†ω
+
Dg α2ω†ω
+
Db α3ω†ω
+ ¯Ur α3α2ω†ω
+
¯Ug α1α3ω†ω
+
¯Ub α2α1ω†ω
+
E−α3α2α1ω†ω,
(6.21)
where ¯V, Dr, . . . E−are eight complex coeﬃcients.
This new ideal, (6.21), is linearly independent from the ﬁrst, (6.19), in the space of
octonionic operators. Clearly, the two are related via the complex conjugate, i 7→−i.
In fact, the complex conjugate is all that is needed in order to map particles into anti-
particles, and vice versa. This was a feature in the models of [42], [35], and also in the
context of left- and right-handed Weyl spinors in [34] and Section 3.5.3 of this thesis. It
was not a feature in [8], [13], [14], [26], or [27], where an additional quaternionic algebra
was implemented in order to obtain Sd.
The Cliﬀord algebra, Cl(6), is known to have just a single 8-complex-dimensional ir-
reducible representation, as in Su, above. In this text, we will none-the-less be including
the conjugate ideal, Sd, in analogy to our inclusion of both left- and right-handed Weyl
48

spinors in Section 4.8. Just as in the case with Weyl spinors, rotations between Su and Sd
are enacted via right multiplication onto these ideals. Su and Sd can then be combined
into a single irreducible representation under Cl(6) ⊗C Cl(2), where the factor of Cl(2)
accounts for the right action that mixes these two spinors with each other. Unlike in the
earlier literature, this additional factor of Cl(2) will originate from right multiplication of
our original octonionic operators on these ideals, instead of having to introduce an entirely
new Cliﬀord algebra, Cl(2). This topic of doubling the spinor space will come up again in
Chapter 9.
As a ﬁnal note, we point out that another interesting way to obtain anti-particles could
be to use the conjugate †, instead of ∗. In that case, the two minimal left ideals would
not be entirely linearly independent from each other. That is, we would ﬁnd a special
Majorana-like property unique to the neutrino:
 ωω†† = ωω†.
6.7
MTIS symmetries: su(3)c and u(1)em
Having obtained these minimal left ideals, we would now like to know how they transform,
so as to justify the labels we gave to their coeﬃcients in equations (6.19) and (6.21). Up
until now, however, we have not speciﬁed under which groups these spinors transform.
A popular choice in the literature for this symmetry group is take the Cliﬀord algebra’s
spin group. For example, the well-known “SO(10)” grand uniﬁed theory is built from the
Spin(10) group acting on 16-dimensional spinors. (Here, spinors are deﬁned as irreducible
representations of Spin(10).) We point out, though, that Spin(10) is a 45-dimensional
group, meaning that 33 generators will need to be explained away in order to arrive ﬁnally
at SU(3)c × SU(2)L × U(1)Y. Could there (alternately, or additionally) be another type of
symmetry, which leads directly to SU(3)c×SU(2)L×U(1)Y? Or to the surviving unbroken
symmetries, SU(3)c × U(1)em?
We would now like to point out some symmetries in the construction of our minimal
left ideals. These symmetries will be called unitary MTIS symmetries, or simply MTIS
symmetries. (Readers may wish to refer back to Section 4.5.1, where maximal totally
isotropic subspaces were ﬁrst deﬁned.) We propose here to consider MTIS symmetries
when building covariant derivatives in gauge theories.
In the case of complex Cliﬀord algebras, Cl(n), with even n, the generating space can
always be partitioned into two maximal totally isotropic subspaces, [1], each of dimension
n/2. For Cl(6) which we have here, the generating space spanned by {ie1, ie2, . . . ie6} is par-
49

titioned into an MTIS spanned by {α1, α2, α3}, and another MTIS spanned by {α†
1, α†
2, α†
3}.
Loosely speaking, MTIS symmetries will preserve this structure.
Unitary MTIS symmetries. We are interested in operator transformations of the
form eiφkgk iej e−iφkgk, where φk ∈R and gk ∈C⊗←−
O. Already, with this constraint, we ﬁnd
that the anti-commutation relations of equations (6.12), (6.13), and (6.14) are preserved.
Furthermore, as the name indicates, we will restrict our attention to those transformations
under which each MTIS is closed. That is, to ﬁrst order, the αi rotate only into themselves,
and the α†
i rotate only into themselves,
[ gk,
X
i
biαi ] =
X
j
cjαj
[ gk,
X
i
b′
iαi
† ] =
X
j
c′
jαj
†,
(6.22)
for some complex coeﬃcients, cj, c′
j. Here, bi, b′
i are some given complex coeﬃcients, and
gk is a generator of the MTIS symmetry.
Finally, we demand that the group transformation on αj commute with hermitian
conjugation, †,
eiφkgk α†
j e−iφkgk =
 e−iφkgk† α†
j
 eiφkgk† .
(6.23)
Under these conditions, in the case of Cl(6), our unitary MTIS symmetries are then
found to be generated uniquely by su(3) and u(1). Explicitly, the SU(3) generators are
given by the Λi of equation (6.5), and the U(1) generator is found to be given by Q of
equation (6.3).
6.8
Ladders to su(3)c and u(1)em
We will now ﬁnd a compact way of describing the generators of the MTIS symmetries,
su(3) and u(1), and apply them to our minimal left ideals.
Consider α ≡c1α1 + c2α2 + c3α3 and α′ ≡c′
1α1 + c′
2α2 + c′
3α3, where the ci and c′
j are
complex coeﬃcients. We can then build hermitian operators, H, of the form
H ≡α′†α + α†α′.
(6.24)
50

Taking the most general sum of these objects results in nine hermitian operators:
X
H
H = r0 Q +
8
X
i=1
riΛi,
(6.25)
where r0 and ri are real coeﬃcients. Q is our electromagnetic generator from equation (6.3),
and the eight Λi can be seen to generate SU(3). Indeed, these Λi coincide with those
described in equation (6.5), which generate a subgroup of the octonionic automorphism
group, G2. It should be noted that earlier authors, [8], [13], [14], were quite close to these
results, but required a second ladder system in order to build Q (and incidentally also all
of the isospin down type states).
In terms of ladder operators, the SU(3) generators take the form
Λ1 = −α†
2α1 −α†
1α2
Λ2 = iα†
2α1 −iα†
1α2
Λ3 = α†
2α2 −α†
1α1
Λ4 = −α†
1α3 −α†
3α1
Λ5 = −iα†
1α3 + iα†
3α1
Λ6 = −α†
3α2 −α†
2α3
Λ7 = iα†
3α2 −iα†

Λ8 = −1

h
α†
1α1 + α†
2α2 −2α†
3α3

(6.26)
all eight of which can be seen to commute with Q, and its conjugate.
We take the operators α and α† to transform according to
ei P H α e−i P H and ei P H α† e−i P H,
(6.27)
respectively. The reader may conﬁrm that α transforms as a 3 and α† transforms as a ¯3
under SU(3), consistent with the results of [42].
Now, the minimal left ideal, Su, transforms as
ei P H Su e−i P H = ei P H Su,
(6.28)
where the equality holds because ω†α†
i = 0 for all i.
We now identify the subspaces of Su by specifying their electric charges with respect to
U(1)em, and also which irreducible representation they belong to under SU(3)c. Clearly,
i, j and k are meant to be distinct from each other in any given row.

it transforms as

where the equality holds because ωαi = 0 for all i. This leads to the table below.

as does a full generation of standard model fermions. These are summarized in Figure
(6.3).

Figure 6.3:
States behaving as a full generation of standard model fermions, represented
by cubes Su (left) and Sd (right). Quark and electron states may be viewed as excitations
from the neutrino or anti-neutrino. As the “vacuum” represents the neutrino, and not the
zero particle state, this model does not constitute a composite model in the usual sense.
6.9
Towards the weak force
Perhaps unexpectedly, it turns out that Su packages all of the isospin up-type states to-
gether, and Sd packages all of the down-type states together. This is of course, if one goes
ahead and makes an assumption about the placement of ν into Su and ¯ν into Sd.
We point out that ω is (automatically) negatively charged, and converts isospin up
particles into isospin down, via right multiplication on Su. It thereby exhibits features
of the W −boson. Similarly, ω† is positively charged, and converts isospin down particles
into isospin up, via right multiplication on Sd. In doing so, it exhibits features of the W +
boson.
Other characteristics of the W bosons do not appear at the level of this chapter. For
example, there is nothing to specify that these candidate bosons act only on left-handed
particles. We also have no description here for the polarization states of these would-be
bosons.
Readers may notice that right multiplication by ω and ω† generate a representation of
Cl(2), so that their inclusion would mean that we are then interested in a representation
of Cl(6) ⊗C Cl(2). This is clearly the analogue of the extra Cl(2) which came from right
53

multiplication of C⊗H, which related left- and right-handed Weyl spinors with each other.
Please see Section 4.8.
6.10
Summary
Using only the complex octonions acting on themselves, we were able to recover a number
of aspects of the standard model’s structure.
First of all, we introduced unitary MTIS symmetries, which led uniquely to the two
unbroken gauge symmetries of the standard model, SU(3)c and U(1)em. This new U(1)em
generator, Q, happens to be proportional to a number operator, thereby suggesting an
unexpected resolution to the question: Why is electric charge quantized?
Then, using octonionic ladder operators, we have built a pair of minimal left ideals,
which is found to transform under these unbroken symmetries as does a full generation of
quarks and leptons.
If the algebra of the complex octonions is not behind the structure of the standard
model, it is then a striking coincidence that SU(3)c and U(1)em both follow readily from
its ladder operators.
54

Chapter 7
Why does SU(2)L act on only
left-handed fermions?
7.1
A spotlight on right multiplication
In Section 4.7, we found a four-complex-dimensional Dirac spinor, ΨD ≡ΨL + ΨR, as an
irreducible representation of Cl(2) ⊗C Cl(2). Here, the second factor of Cl(2) came from
right-multiplying C ⊗H on itself, and it eﬀected transitions between L and R states.
Likewise, in Section 6.6, we found a 16-complex-dimensional spinor, S ≡Su +Sd, as an
irreducible representation of Cl(6) ⊗C Cl(2). Again, we see that the factor of Cl(2) came
from right multiplication, but this time it eﬀected transitions between isospin up-type and
isospin down-type states.
We can now combine these spinors by taking the tensor product of the spaces ΨD and
S, as in Υ ≡ΨD ⊗C S, resulting in a 64-complex-dimensional spinor space. The Cliﬀord
algebra associated with spinors in Υ can easily be seen to be Cl(6) ⊗C Cl(2) ⊗C Cl(2) ⊗C
Cl(2) ≃Cl(12).
In this chapter, we will be interested in only the Cl(2) ⊗C Cl(2) ≃Cl(4) sector of this
Cliﬀord algebra, which comes exclusively from right multiplication. This sector encodes
transitions between L and R states, and also between isospin up-type and down-type states.
In doing so, we will be able to catch a glimpse of how SU(2)L symmetries are expected
to come about in this model. Focussing on the leptonic sector, we will again make use of
MTIS symmetries, which were already introduced in Section 6.7.
55

It turns out that the MTIS symmetries for Cl(4) are generated by su(2) and u(1). This
su(2), applied to the minimal right ideal which we will now construct, automatically acts
on only one of the fermions’ chiralities. In other words, MTIS symmetries seem to be
able to oﬀer an explanation for the curious favouritism exhibited by particle physics, for
fermions of a particular handedness. Such an explanation is absent in the standard model.
7.2
Leptonic subspace of Cl(4)
We will now build a minimal right ideal, using the procedure laid out in Section 4.5.2.
Readers should note that when multiplying elements constructed from R ⊗C ⊗H ⊗O, the
quaternionic and octonionic imaginary units always commute with each other.
1. Let us consider a Cliﬀord algebra, Cl(4), generated by the vectors, {τ1iϵx, τ2iϵx, τ3iϵx, iϵy},
where
τ1 ≡ω + ω†,
τ2 ≡iω −iω†,
τ3 ≡ωω† −ω†ω.
(7.1)
Notice, that these four generators involve the right-multiplied octonionic object, ω, of
Section 6.9, and also the right-multiplied quaternionic objects of Section 4.7.
2. Within this generating space, we may now identify an MTIS spanned by the objects
β1 and β2 over C, and another MTIS spanned by the objects β‡
1 and β‡
2 over C. Here, the
conjugate, ‡, maps the complex i 7→−i, the quaternionic ϵi 7→−ϵi and the octonionic
ej 7→−ej. It also reverses the order of multiplication. The lowering operators, βj, will be
deﬁned here as
β1 ≡1
2 (−ϵy + iϵxτ3)
and
β2 ≡ω†iϵx.
(7.2)
Readers may conﬁrm that {βi, βj} = {β‡
i , β‡
j} = 0, and that {βi, β‡
j} ≡δij, on the leptonic
subspace.
3. The nilpotent object, Ω, may now be constructed as Ω= β2β1.
56

4. The projector, Ω‡Ω, is then found to be Ω‡Ω= ωω†ϵ↓↓. This idempotent will act
as our vacuum state, and can be identiﬁed with the spin-down right-handed neutrino, in
keeping with the vacua of previous chapters.
5. Finally, right-multiplying Cl(4) onto our projector, we obtain the minimal right
ideal,
Ω‡ΩCl(4)
=
V↓
R ωω†ϵ↓↓+ V↓
L ωω†ϵ↓↓β‡
1 + E−↓
L ωω†ϵ↓↓β‡
2 + E−↓

R ωω†ϵ↓↓+ V↓
L ωω†ϵ↓↑+ E−↓
L ωϵ↓↑+ E−↓
R ωϵ↓↓,
(7.3)
where the basis elements have been labelled consistently with previous chapters.
The above minimal right ideal clearly corresponds to spin-down leptons; the spin-up
states can easily be found by acting with a C ⊗H raising operator, as was shown in
Section 4.6.1.
7.3
MTIS symmetries: su(2)L and u(1)Y
Now that we have constructed a minimal right ideal, we would like to see how it transforms
under the MTIS symmetries for this Cliﬀord algebra, as deﬁned in Section 6.7.
Again, MTIS symmetries are those which act on the generating space as eiφkgk | e−iφkgk,
which map non-trivially the lowering operators to themselves, and the raising operators to
themselves, and which commute with hermitian conjugation, here, ‡. The generators gk
this time will be elements of (C ⊗H) ⊗C (C ⊗←−
O) ≡R ⊗C ⊗H ⊗←−
O.
Readers may conﬁrm that there are four solutions to these constraints, given by
T1 ≡τ1 ϵ↑↑,
T2 ≡τ2 ϵ↑↑,
T3 ≡τ3 ϵ↑↑,
N ′ ≡1
2 (1 + iϵzτ3) + ω†ω.
(7.4)
The three Ti can be seen to generate SU(2), whereas N ′ commutes with the Ti, and itself
generates U(1). N ′ may be viewed as a number operator for the Cl(4) system; it is nothing
more than the weak isospin operator, Y , on this leptonic subspace. Or, more accurately,
N ′ = −2Y . On the other hand, the Ti can be seen to annihilate the right-handed neutrino
and right-handed electron states, while transforming the left-handed leptons together as a
doublet. Please see Figure 7.1.

. This model
then demonstrates a representation of su(2) which acts automatically on states of only one
chirality. On this leptonic subspace, the remaining u(1) turns out to be weak hypercharge.
7.4
Summary and outlook
In this chapter, we have focussed our attention on Cl(2)⊗CCl(2) ≃Cl(4) structure, coming
from the right action on our previously constructed minimal left ideals. From this Cliﬀord
algebra, Cl(4), we have then constructed a 4-complex-dimensional minimal right ideal,
corresponding to a leptonic subspace of a generation of standard model particles. We then
found the unitary MTIS symmetries corresponding to this Cliﬀord algebra. It turns out
that the four MTIS symmetry generators correspond to su(2)L and Y on this leptonic
subspace, and furthermore provide an explanation as to why left-handed particles in this
model interact via SU(2), whereas right-handed particles do not.
As a ﬁnal note, we point out that the dimensions of the spinors introduced in this thesis
suggest a possible connection to triality.

Chapter 8
Group representation structure of
some grand uniﬁed theories
We mentioned in the previous chapter, that combing our results for C ⊗H and C ⊗O will
bring us to consider the Cliﬀord algebra Cl(12). That is, our Dirac spinor, ΨD = ΨL + ΨR
was found to be an irreducible representation of Cl(2)⊗CCl(2), and our generation of quarks
and leptons of Chapter 6 was found to be an irreducible representation of Cl(6) ⊗C Cl(2).
Taking the tensor product of the two Cliﬀord algebras gives Cl(2) ⊗C Cl(2) ⊗C Cl(6) ⊗C
Cl(2) ≃Cl(12).
Now, the Cliﬀord algebra, Cl(12), can be rewritten as Cl(10) ⊗C Cl(2), where we have
separated out a factor of Cl(2), corresponding to spin. The remaining Cl(10) algebra is
tied in closely with some well-known grand uniﬁed theories, which we will now introduce.
8.1
SU(5) uniﬁcation
8.1.1
Introduction
The SU(5) grand uniﬁed theory oﬀers a classic example of what it means to be a grand
uniﬁed theory. It was proposed in 1974 by H. Georgi and S. Glashow, [38], and can be seen
to successfully unify the gauge groups of the standard model. However, the SU(5) model
only partially uniﬁes a generation of quarks and leptons.
The group SU(5) has rank 4, as with the standard model’s gauge group, GSM; that
is, its Lie algebra has a 4-dimensional Cartan subalgebra, [48]. The Lie algebra of SU(5)
59

essentially doubles the gauge symmetry of the standard model by subsuming the standard
model’s 12 symmetry generators, and then incorporating another 12, for a total of 24.
Irreducible representations for SU(5) are listed as
1, 5, 10, 15, 24, 35, 40, 45, 50, . . .
Most descriptions of the SU(5) model give a generation of quarks and leptons, which
stretches across the 5∗and the 10, and optionally, the singlet, 1.
This singlet can be
included so as to represent the right-handed neutrino. In contrast, gauge bosons lie in the
24, while the Higgs ﬁelds typically are represented by the 5 and the 24.
Despite its anticipated candidacy as a suitable ﬁt to nature, the SU(5) grand uniﬁed
theory has run into trouble with experiment. For example, the theory predicts proton
decay, with a lifetime of 1031±2 years, depending on the details and source of the calculation,
[53], [48]. This is generally seen to be at odds with the ﬁndings of the Super-kamiokande
experiment, [20], [21], which gives a proton lifetime of ≥5.9 × 1033 years at the 90%
conﬁdence level.
8.1.2
GSM inside SU(5)
Here, we detail the embedding of the standard model’s gauge group into SU(5), as given
in [7].
Elements of SU(5) can be written down as 5 × 5 complex matrices, wherein we may
embed the standard model’s gauge group, [7], [48]. Starting with SU(2) and SU(3), we
have
h2
0
0
h3

∈
SU(5),
(8.1)
where h2 is a 2 × 2 matrix representing elements of SU(2), and h3 is a 3 × 3 matrix,
representing elements of SU(3). Written in this way, the SU(2) and SU(3) subgroups
clearly commute with each other.
We might then ask, what groups remain in SU(5),
which commute with both of these SU(2) and SU(3) subgroups?
It is straightforward to see, [7], [64], that any 5 × 5 matrix commuting with
h2
0
0
h3

60

must be of the form
H1
=
c2 I2×2
0
0
c3 I3×3

,
(8.2)
for c2, c3 ∈C. Furthermore, for H1 to be an element of SU(5), it must have a determinant
of one, so that
H1
=
(h1)3 I2×2
0
0
(h1)−2 I3×3

,
(8.3)
where h1 ∈C.
Putting these all together, we see that it is possible to map any element of SU(3) ×
SU(2) × U(1) into SU(5),
(h1)3 h2
0
0
(h1)−2 h3

∈
SU(5),
(8.4)
where h1 ∈U(1), h2 ∈SU(2), and h3 ∈SU(3).
Now, it turns out that after considering the action of the SU(2) and SU(3) subgroups
on the 5∗and the 10, we see that this U(1) of equation (8.3) is none other than U(1)Y , weak
hypercharge. That is, SU(5) theory is able to elegantly explain the strikingly inelegant
arrangement of hypercharges asserted by the standard model.
A question now arises, as to whether or not every element of SU(3) × SU(2) × U(1) is
mapped to a unique element of SU(5)’s subgroup. That is, we might ask, is this mapping
invertible? It turns out that the answer is no, [7], as it is possible to ﬁnd distinct elements
of SU(3) × SU(2) × U(1), given by
 h3 = z2
n I3×3, h2 = z−3
n I2×2, h1 = zn

∈
SU(3) × SU(2) × U(1),
(8.5)
which each map to the same identity element of our SU(5) subgroup,
z3
n z−3
n I2×2
0
0
z−2
n z2
n I3×3

= I5×5
∈
SU(5).
(8.6)
61

The above elements, zn, are restricted to be sixth roots of unity, zn = e2πin/6, since
z−3
n I2×2 ∈SU(2) and z2
n I3×3 ∈SU(3) must each have a determinant of one. This generates
the ﬁnite group Z6.
So it turns out that our subgroup of SU(5) is not SU(3) × SU(2) × U(1), but rather,
SU(3) × SU(2) × U(1)/Z6. This could be problematic for SU(5) theory, if the standard
model representations were indeed able to distinguish between these six values of zn.
However, by checking explicitly one can show that the standard model representations
are insensitive to these distinct values of zn. Furthermore, Z6 is said, [7], to constitute the
entire kernel of this representation. This leaves us with the conclusion that the standard
model’s gauge group is not SU(3) × SU(2) × U(1), but rather, SU(3) × SU(2) × U(1)/Z6.
8.1.3
Some notes on symmetry breaking
The adjoint Higgs ﬁeld is responsible for breaking SU(5) symmetry down to SU(3) ×
SU(2)×U(1)/Z6, [64]. In the process, the fermionic 5∗and 10 break into ( SU(3)c, SU(2)L, U(1)Y )

tional outstanding problems for SU(5) theory, [48]. Namely, there is no clear explanation
for the large diﬀerences between the GUT scale, where SU(5) breaks, and the weak scale,
where GSM breaks (GUT hierarchy problem). Secondly, as the Higgs 5 breaks into a dou-
blet under SU(2)L and a triplet under SU(3)c, both pieces must be accounted for. The
Higgs boson, as we now know, has a relatively small mass of about 125 GeV. However, in
order to evade proton decay, the remaining triplet must acquire a large mass ≥1014 GeV,
and there is no obvious reason for these two mass scales to be so far apart (doublet triplet
splitting problem) [48].
8.2
A fermionic binary code
It turns out that there is a very eﬃcient way of describing the standard model’s fermions,
which is helpful in understanding SU(5), Spin(10), Pati-Salam theories, and incidentally,
also upcoming R ⊗C ⊗H ⊗O models based on Cl(12). This is in terms of a binary code,
[7], [64]. For a thorough explanation of this topic, the reader is encouraged to consult [7].
This fermionic binary code can be thought of as a sequence of answers to ﬁve diﬀerent
yes or no questions:
63

Is the fermion red?
Is the fermion green?
Is the fermion blue?
Does the fermion have isospin up?
Does the fermion have isospin down?
The set of answers to these ﬁve questions can be represented by an exterior algebra,
ΛC5, which is 25 = 32-complex dimensional. For example, a fermion which is red, r, and
has isospin up, u, would be represented by r ∧u. A fermion which is said to be both red,
r, and blue, b, and has both isospin up, u, and isospin down, d, would be represented by
r ∧b ∧u ∧d, and so on. (It may seem odd for a particle to be both red and blue, or to
have both isospin up and isospin down, but this should become clear shortly.) Please see
Figure 8.1.

Now, complex linear combinations of the basis vectors, r, g, b, u, d, may be acted upon
by SU(5), where they form the irreducible representation, 5. By extension, the bivectors
of ΛC5 form the 10, the three-vectors form the 10∗, the four-vectors form the 5∗, whereas
both the unit, 1, and the ﬁve-vector form singlets. We then see that we have exactly
64

the right SU(5) representations to describe one generation of standard model particles,
together with the right-handed neutrino, including all corresponding antiparticles. Please

and the rest of ΛC5 can then be seen to follow suit. This then allows us to identify each
element of ΛC5 with one of the standard model’s fermions, as shown in Figure 8.3.
Readers may notice that SU(5) respects the grading of ΛC5, and that all left-handed
particles reside in the even grades, while all right-handed particles reside in the odd grades.

Spin(10) uniﬁcation
Although the SU(5) model was able to draw together the three gauge groups of the stan-
dard model into a single group, it only partially uniﬁed the standard model’s fermions into

the 5∗and the 10. One might wonder if an alternate Lie group might exist, which could
fully unify not only the standard model’s gauge bosons, but also its fermions.
One Lie group which does hit the mark is Spin(10). The Spin(10) grand uniﬁed theory
is more commonly known in the literature as the “SO(10)” model, and was proposed by
H. Georgi in 1974/1975, [37], and independently by H. Fritzsch and P. Minkowski in 1975,
[31].
Spin(10) is the double cover of the group SO(10), and is of rank 5, [48]. It uniﬁes the
standard model’s gauge group, and extends it from 12 dimensions to 45. A generation of
quarks and leptons in this model is uniﬁed into a 16-dimensional spinor, with a conjugate
spinor accounting for the required anti-particles. This spinor representation can be seen
to naturally account for a right-handed neutrino, [7].
The group, Spin(10), is associated with the Cliﬀord algebra Cl(10), which has an
irreducible representation given by a 32-dimensional Dirac spinor. Under Spin(10), this
Dirac spinor breaks down into two irreducible representations, known as Weyl spinors,
which are each 16-dimensional. Now, it can be shown, [7], that Dirac spinors of the group
66

Spin(2n) can be represented by the exterior algebra, ΛCn. Hence, we see that the exterior
algebra, ΛC5, which we just described in the previous section, is capable of acting not
only as a representation of SU(5), but also as a representation of Spin(10). Please see
Figure 8.4.
Readers may recognize that this same pattern has appeared more than once in this
thesis. That is, minimal left ideals, such as ΨL and Su, have been built using raising
operators of the Cliﬀord algebras Cl(2) and Cl(6), respectively. These raising operators
may be viewed as generating exterior algebras. For example, by looking at equation (6.19)
of Section 6.4, it is easy to see how the Dirac spinor, Su, is built from the exterior algebra,
ΛC3, generated by α†

Figure 8.4:
The exterior algebra ΛC5, representing a fermionic binary code, with the cor-
responding standard model particles written underneath. Here, basis elements connected
by lines in the even part of the algebra form one irreducible representation under Spin(10),
with left-handed chirality. Similarly, those basis elements in the odd part of the algebra
form another irreducible representation under Spin(10), with right-handed chirality.
Now, it can be shown that our representation of SU(5) resides inside that of Spin(10),
[7]. As with SU(5), the group Spin(10) can be seen to respect the chirality of particles; it
does not mix left- and right-handed species. However, it does not respect the grading of
67

ΛC5, as do SU(5) and GSM.
8.4
Pati-Salam model
Before the introduction of SU(5)- and Spin(10)-theories came an extension to the standard
model, now known as the Pati-Salam model. The model is named after its inventors, J.
Pati and A. Salam, who published the proposal in 1974, [57].
The Pati-Salam model may be considered to be a more conservative approach to uni-
ﬁcation.
It does not unify the gauge groups of the standard model into a simple Lie
group, as with SU(5) and Spin(10). Instead, it is based on the gauge group, SU(2) ×
SU(2) × SU(4) ≃Spin(4) × Spin(6), [7], which extends the dimension of GSM from 12 to
3 + 3 + 15 = 21.
One main goal of the Pati-Salam model is to capitalize on the fact that the standard
model treats quarks and leptons similarly under weak isospin. Hence, the authors proposed
that leptons might be considered as just another type of quark, which happen to be of a
fourth colour, beyond the usual red, green and blue of SU(3)c. This fourth colour would
then be identiﬁed with lepton number, thereby extending SU(3)c to SU(4), [57].
Perhaps perplexed by the standard model’s apparent preference for left-handed par-
ticles, Pati and Salam further extended GSM by incorporating an extra factor of SU(2),
meant for right-handed particles. With SU(3)c extended to SU(4) and SU(2)L extended
to SU(2)L ×SU(2)R, we then arrive at SU(2)×SU(2)×SU(4). It turns out that the stan-
dard model’s U(1)Y stretches across the right-handed SU(2), and also the SU(4) factor,
[7].
The standard model’s gauge group may be mapped into SU(2) × SU(2) × SU(4) as
shown in [7],

for h1 ∈U(1), h2 ∈SU(2), and h3 ∈SU(3).
With the gauge groups in hand, it is now fairly straightforward to build up the fermionic
vector spaces proposed in this model. The group SU(4) can be made to act on a four-
complex-dimensional vector, C4, and its conjugate, C4∗. For the SU(2)L × SU(2)R sector,
68

we choose a left-handed doublet, C2 ⊗C C, and a right-handed doublet, C ⊗C C2. Putting
these all together gives the Pati-Salam representation, [7],

,
(8.11)
which is 32-complex dimensional.
In keeping with the fact that SU(2)×SU(2)×SU(4) ≃Spin(4)×Spin(6), it turns out
that there is another way to describe the fermionic space, f. This is in terms of the Dirac
spinors, which form representations of Spin(4) and Spin(6). These Dirac spinors may be
expressed as the exterior algebras, ΛC2 and ΛC3, respectively, so that
f ≃ΛC2 ⊗C ΛC3.
(8.12)
Let us now consider ΛC2 to be generated by u and d, and ΛC3 to be generated by
r, g, and b, which are familiar from Section 8.2. We can now take the tensor product
between these two exterior algebras, and arrange them so as to see the similarity between
ΛC2 ⊗C ΛC3 and ΛC5 from Section 8.2. Please see Figure 8.5. Clearly, going from the
ΛC2 ⊗C ΛC3 fermionic space to the ΛC5 fermionic space, requires simply replacing the
tensor product in objects such as r ⊗u with the wedge product, giving r ∧u, [7].

Chapter 9
Towards a three-generation model
9.1
Introduction
Despite the wide range of proposals to simplify the standard model, most schemes tend
to share the same impedances.
Few uniﬁed models naturally oﬀer more than a single
generation of particles, and few are able to evade proton decay without repercussion.
In previous chapters, we were also concerned with ﬁnding just a one-generation model
of particle physics, based on C ⊗O. However, this begs the question: could C ⊗O provide
room for three?
In this chapter, we point out a somewhat mysterious appearance of SU(3)c represen-
tations, which exhibit the behaviour of three full generations of standard model particles.
These representations are found in the Cliﬀord algebra Cl(6), arising from the complex
octonions. Back in Section 6.3, we explained how this 64-complex-dimensional space came
about. With the algebra in place, we will now identify new generators of SU(3) within
it. These SU(3) generators then act to partition the remaining part of the 64-dimensional
Cliﬀord algebra into six triplets, six singlets, and their antiparticles. That is, the algebra
mirrors the chromodynamic structure of exactly three generations of the standard model’s
quarks and leptons.
Passing from particle to antiparticle, or vice versa, requires nothing more than eﬀecting
the complex conjugate, ∗: i 7→−i. The entire result is achieved using only the eight-
dimensional complex octonions as a single ingredient.
71

The purpose of this chapter is not to oﬀer a completed uniﬁed gauge theory, or even a
completed description of QCD. Instead, we propose a gateway from which such a theory
might be found.
To the best of this author’s knowledge, [35] was the ﬁrst account of these three-
generation results found either within the octonions, or Cl(6).
9.2
Generators of SU(3)c
As mentioned earlier, the automorphism group of the octonions is G2, which is a 14-
dimensional exceptional Lie group. Within G2, we may ﬁnd a subgroup, SU(3), which
is deﬁned as that subgroup of G2 which keeps the imaginary unit, e7, invariant. The Lie
algebra of this SU(3), acting on f ∈C ⊗O may be expressed as
Λ1f = i

Clearly, the Λi, as expressed above, constitute elements of C⊗←−
O. In earlier references,
[41], [42], [26], these Λi are shown to act on quark and lepton representations in the eight-
dimensional C⊗O, or multiple copies thereof. In contrast, here we introduce the Λi acting
on quark and lepton representations within the 64-dimensional C ⊗←−
O.
72

Taking a hint from [34], let us now introduce a related representation of su(3), which
will draw out structure in C ⊗←−
O, familiar from the behaviour of quarks and leptons.

Three generations under SU(3)c
Knowing that the Λnν behave as an eight dimensional representation under the action
of [Λmν , · ], one might wonder how objects of the more general form aν behave under
[Λmν , · ].
Obeying [Λmν , ℓjν] = 0 ∀m = 1 . . . 8, we ﬁnd six SU(3) singlets, whose basis vectors
are given by

That is, unlike the standard model, we are able to pass back and forth between particle
and anti-particle using only the complex conjugate i 7→−i. This feature appeared early on
in the work of [41] for some internal degrees of freedom, and also in [34] and Section 3.5.3
when passing between left- and right-handed Weyl spinors.

Summary for SU(3)c

Figure 9.1:
The 64-dimensional octonionic chain algebra splits into two sets of SU(3)
generators of the form iΛν and −iΛ∗ν∗, six SU(3) singlets ℓj, six triplets qk, and their
complex conjugates. These objects are sectioned oﬀabove into four quadrants according
to their forms: νaν, ν∗aν, νaν∗and ν∗aν∗for a in the chain algebra. Transforming particles
into anti-particles, and vice versa, requires only the complex conjugate ∗: i 7→−i in our
formalism.
Using only the eight-dimensional complex octonions, C ⊗O, we have explained how to
build up a 64-complex-dimensional associative algebra. The SU(3) generators identiﬁed
77

within this algebra then break down the remaining space into six singlets, six triplets, and
their antiparticles, with no extra particles beyond these.
These representations are a curious ﬁnding. They eﬀortlessly suggest the existence of
exactly three generations, they relate particles to antiparticles by using only the complex
conjugate i 7→−i, and ﬁnally, they ﬁll these tall orders while working from but a modest
eight-complex-dimensional algebra.
9.6
Three generations under SU(3)c and U(1)em
Since the time that these irreducible representations of SU(3)c were identiﬁed within C⊗←−
O,
more standard model structure has been uncovered in the algebra. It turns out that we
can extend our three-generation results for SU(3)c to include U(1)em as well (presented for
the ﬁrst time here).
That is, our SU(3)c action on C ⊗←−
O given by
[ Λjν, aν ],
[ −Λ∗
jν∗, aν∗]
(9.19)
can be generalized, so as to include electric charges.
Furthermore, we will be able to
incorporate U(1)em by making use of the Q we had already introduced in our one-generation
model of Section 6.8,
Q = N
3 =
3
X
i=1
α†
iαi.
(9.20)
Consider the following action for the SU(3)c generators,
[ Λjν, S∗aν ] ,

−Λ∗
jν∗, Saν∗
,
[ Λjν, Saν ] ,

−Λ∗
jν∗, S∗aν∗
,
(9.21)
where S is the projector given by
S ≡1
2 −ie7
4 + i
4 (e13 + e26 + e45) .
(9.22)
78

Clearly, S + S∗= 1, so that we see that this new action (9.21) is no diﬀerent from the
original action (9.19). Although it has not been mentioned before, S is a projector which
has come up frequently in complex-octonionic work; it is nothing more than the right-
multiplication analogue of ν = 1
2 (1 + ie7). Or in other words,
f 1
2 (1 + ie7) = Sf
∀f ∈C ⊗O.
(9.23)
It so happens that −Λ∗
j = Λj ∀j = 1 . . . 8, so that the action (9.21) may be rewritten
as
[ Λjν, S∗aν ] ,

−Λ∗
jν∗, Saν∗
,

−Λ∗
jν, Saν

,
[ Λjν∗, S∗aν∗] .
(9.24)
Now, an action for electric charge may be found, which matches the SU(3)c action of
(9.24). Namely,
[ Qν, S∗aν ] ,
[ −Q∗ν∗, Saν∗] ,
[ −Q∗ν, Saν ] ,
[ Qν∗, S∗aν∗] .
(9.25)
Under these actions (9.24) and (9.25), we ﬁnd SU(3)c and U(1)em charge assignments,
which are consistent with three generations of standard model particles. Below, we relabel
the states given earlier in equations (9.7)-(9.16), so as to now specify their electric charges.
At this level, we are not specifying which generation each state belongs to, so for
i = 1, 2, 3, the three states with electric charge of -1 will be labelled e−
i ; the three states
with electric charge of +1 will be labelled e+
i ; the three states with electric charge of 2/3
will be labelled ui; the three states with electric charge of −2/3 will be labelled ¯ui; the three
states with electric charge −1/3 will be labelled di, and the three states with electric charge
1/3 will be labelled ¯di. Since SU(3)c and U(1)em do not distinguish between neutrinos, νi
and anti-neutrinos, ¯νi, we will then label the six states with electric charge of zero as ni
and ¯ni, where the symbol ni could represent either a neutrino or anti-neutrino.

Outlook: From one generation to three
In Section 6.8, we described a one-generation model in C ⊗←−
O, transforming under the
symmetry generators Λj and Q. In Section 9 we described a three-generation model in
C ⊗←−
O, transforming under the symmetry generators Λjν and Qν. Given that they make
use of the same algebras, and very similar symmetry generators, one might wonder if the
one-generation and three-generation models could be connected.
Direct veriﬁcation shows that the one-generation representation and its symmetries do
not ﬁt directly into the three-generation model in any obvious way. However, we suspect
that the similarity between these two models is no coincidence and there could be a way
to go from one to the other. 1.
1For example, one might consider sums of objects of the form SuSu† and SdSd† in order to move from
81

states Su and Sd in the one-generation model to states in the three-generation model.

Chapter 10
Conclusion
As a non-associative algebra, one might have naturally expected that R⊗C⊗H⊗O would
not be ﬁt to describe the action of groups. And with no more than 32 complex dimensions,
one might have further anticipated that R ⊗C ⊗H ⊗O would not have the capacity to
describe much of the standard model, whose particle content spans hundreds of degrees of
freedom.
Upon closer inspection, though, this algebra can be seen to exhibit a surprising amount
of the standard model’s structure. Over the years, numerous authors have pointed out
various Lorentz representations, within C ⊗H. In this thesis, we have then gone on to
consolidate all of the standard model’s Lorentz representations in terms of generalized
ideals of C ⊗H.
In the early seventies, G¨unaydin and G¨ursey showed SU(3)c quark structure within the
octonions, [41]. This thesis then subsequently provided a way to extend this octonionic
quark model so as to include leptons and the electromagnetic charge operator. This com-
pletes one full generation of quarks and leptons, and describes their behaviour under the
unbroken gauge symmetries of the standard model. Our use of minimal left ideals from
only C ⊗O allowed us to provide a straightforward explanation for the quantization of
electric charge.
We also demonstrated a rudimentary leptonic model with this R ⊗C ⊗H ⊗O algebra,
whereby SU(2)L acts automatically on only left-handed states. We have repeatedly shown
the generators of standard model gauge symmetries appearing, uniquely, as particular
symmetries of the algebra’s ladder operators.
Finally, within the octonionic sector of R⊗C⊗H⊗O, we found the SU(3)c and U(1)em
representations corresponding to three full generations of quarks and leptons. Given that
83

most uniﬁed theories are based on a single generation, this may be viewed as an unusual
ﬁnding.
Although evidence is accumulating in support of a connection between the standard
model and R ⊗C ⊗H ⊗O, we certainly do not have a complete model, at the moment.
However, with every new discovery, it becomes a little more clear that this unlikely algebra
is not going away.
