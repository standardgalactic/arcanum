Tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) has been extensively explored as a p-electron donor in supramolecular systems.
Over the last two decades substantial advances have been made in terms of constructing elaborate
architectures based on TTF and in exploiting the resulting systems in the context of supramolecular
host–guest recognition. The inherent electron-donating character of TTF derivatives has led to their use
in the construction of highly efficient optoelectronic materials, optical sensors, and electron-transfer
ensembles. TTFs are also promising candidates for the development of the so-called ‘‘functional
materials’’ that might see use in a range of modern technological applications. Novel synthetic
strategies, coupled with the versatility inherent within the TTF moiety, are now allowing the architecture
of TTF-based systems to be tuned precisely and modified for use in specific purposes. In this critical
review, we provide a ‘‘state-of-the-art’’ overview of research involving TTF-based macrocyclic systems
with a focus on their use in supramolecular host–guest recognition, as components in non-covalent
electron transfer systems, and in the construction of ‘‘molecular machines’’.

1. Introduction
Since the revolutionary discovery of the first conducting
‘‘organic metals’’ based on tetrathiafulvalene (TTF), including
[TTF+/Cl]1,2 and [TTF/TCNQ],3 in the early 1970’s, a large
number of TTF derivatives have been reported in the literature.
In fact, to date, over seven thousand papers have been pub-
lished on the synthesis, functionalisation, or use of TTF deri-
vatives as inferred from a Scifinder Scholar search using the
key word ‘‘tetrathiafulvalene’’. TTF subunits are of particular
interest as potential electron donors in charge-transfer (CT)
complexes intended for use in a variety of applications, including
electrochemical switches, electron transfer ensembles and
sensors. Several reviews outlining these applications have been
published in recent years.4–20
A separate broad theme within the context of TTF chemistry
involves the design and synthesis of receptor systems that
incorporate this quintessential redox active moiety. Among
this generalised class of hosts, TTF-annulated macrocyclic
compounds occupy a central position. This importance reflects
in part the fact that they can act as ‘‘functional materials’’
that display redox active features and which respond to various
environmental inputs. This has permitted the construction
of macrocyclic systems that recognise anions, explosives and
certain other guest molecules. Switchable behaviour, particu-
larly an ability to encapsulate, bind, and reversibly release
guest molecules, as well as support colourimetric and electro-
chemical sensing, are often hallmarks of these systems. However,
reviews focused on this aspect of TTF chemistry are all but non-
existent. Therefore, the goal of this Critical Review is to highlight
some of the most salient applications of TTF-based macrocyclic
systems including cage systems and their functional features. Also
included is a brief discussion of TTF-catenane based ‘‘molecular
machines’’.
2. Scope of this review
There are several reviews highlighting the TTF-oligomers bearing
diﬀerent functionalities,7–12,21–24 as well as one focused on
TTF-cyclophanes and cage-motifs.25 Reviews summarising the
chemistry of TTF-based donor–acceptor (D–A) ensembles and
their potential application as molecular materials and devices
have also appeared.26–28 However, the reviews in question are not
recent (i.e., published Z10 years ago) and they do not provide
coverage of relatively new and often quite complex systems.
A review article was recently published by some of the present
authors.20 However, this latter review was focused exclusively on
TTF-based polypyrrolic systems and did not highlight TTF-based
supramolecular receptors. The present review is designed to

address this latter coverage lacuna and to highlight the potential
of TTF-based receptors to act as ‘‘functional materials’’.
TTF-fused macrocyclic systems have attracted considerable
attention as potential receptors for electron poor guests, such
as nitroaromatic explosives. Other TTF-derived systems have
unique bowl-like shapes that allow them to encapsulate and
separate spherical guests, such as C60. Some of the TTF-based
systems reported in recent years have been found to act as
electron reservoirs that function as readily controllable electron
donors. The goal of this present review is to provide a general
overview that will summarise the state-of-the-art in TTF-based
macrocycle chemistry while providing a foundation for the
design of the next generation of ‘‘functional materials’’ containing
electroactive TTF-moieties. In this context, our goal is to summarise
the chemistry and applications of various TTF-based macrocyclic
compounds, including TTF-calix[4]pyrroles, so-called exTTF-
macrocycles, TTF-carcerands, TTF-hemicarcerands, TTF-cryptands,
as well as TTF-based metalla-macrocyclic systems. We also review
the various design strategies that have led to the synthesis of
‘‘functional materials’’ and electroactive ‘‘molecular machines’’.
Throughout the treatment, a key focus will be on potential
applications.
In the first part of this review, we describe various TTF- (and
exTTF-) annulated macrocyclic systems and their applications
in host–guest chemistry. The second part is dedicated to
organic TTF- (and exTTF-) based cage systems (including
metalla-cages) and their ability to bind electron poor guests
by means of supramolecular D–A type interactions. In this
section, the electrochemical and photophysical effects asso-
ciated with guest binding are discussed. Some of the salient
materials applications of TTF-based metal–organic-frameworks
(MOFs)
and
covalent-organic-frameworks
(COFs)
are
also
briefly mentioned. Finally, we outline the design strategies
used to prepare electroactive ‘‘molecular machines’’ based on
macrocyclic systems containing TTF subunits. In this context,
interlocked molecular architectures, e.g., catenanes will receive
particular emphasis.
3. TTF-based macrocyclic systems
As described in the introduction, tremendous eﬀorts have been
made to attach electroactive TTF moieties to classic macrocyclic
motifs to produce hybrid molecular systems. For example,
TTF(s) have been grafted onto the periphery of crown ethers,
cryptands and calixpyrroles to make increasingly complex
structures. This has provided electroactive macrocyclic systems
that retain the core molecular recognition features of the parent
macrocycles. On the other hand, the TTF moieties incorporated
in this way function as transducers that respond to external
inputs (stimuli), thus producing a change in the overall electro-
nic features of the system. This change can be typically detected
by electrochemical or spectroscopic means. The result can be
elaborated receptor systems with considerable sensing capability.
3.1.
TTF-calixpyrroles as anion sensors
Annulation of TTF derivatives onto a pyrrole subunit through
the b,b0 positions provides useful new building blocks that can
impart both rigidity and electron-donating character to a range
of polypyrrolic macrocycles (e.g., porphyrins, phthalocyanines,
subphthalocyanines, calixpyrroles, etc.). When incorporated
into a calix[n]pyrrole (n = 4, 5 and 6) framework, higher binding
aﬃnities toward anions are observed as the result of increased
NH–anion hydrogen-bonding interactions.29 The peripheral
TTF subunits are inherently electron-rich. They can thus pro-
vide ancillary sites for guest recognition. The underlying shape
of the system can play a role. For instance, clip-like systems that
adopt tweezers-type geometries are potential hosts for many
planar electron deficient guests. Often the resulting host–guest

supramolecular complexation and sensing behaviour is reflected
in noticeable colour changes under ambient conditions.
The chemistry of TTF-calix[4]pyrrole-based anion sensors
was originally developed by Jeppesen and Sessler and has been
thoroughly reviewed recently.20 Nevertheless, a brief discussion
is appropriate here. The chemical structures of few representa-
tive TTF-based macrocyclic systems are given in Chart 1. Of
these, compounds 1–6 are potential electrochemical sensors for
ionic substrates.30,31 Receptor 4 is particularly noteworthy; it
displays several exciting chemical and photophysical features
that were ascribed in large measure to its ability to adopt two
different limiting conformations viz. the (a) 1,3-alternate and
the (b) cone-like conformers in the absence and presence of
anions, respectively. In the absence of anions, the 1,3-alternate
form is energetically favourable as is the case for most other
calix[4]pyrroles. In contrast, in the presence of coordinating
anions, such as Cl, these systems adopt the corresponding
cone conformation, a change that is ascribed to strong hydrogen-
bonding interactions between the pyrrolic NH protons and the
bound anionic guest (Fig. 1).
3.2.
TTF-based calix[4]pyrroles as sensors for neutral electron-
deficient aromatic guests
The TTF-based calix[4]pyrrole system, 4, also acts as an eﬀective
receptor for electron deficient planar nitroaromatic compounds,
including
1,3,5-trinitrobenzene
(TNB),
tetrafluoro-p-benzo-
quinone, tetrachloro-p-benzoquinone and p-benzoquinone, in
dichloromethane solution.32 The underlying neutral substrate
recognition requires the 1,3-conformer. It can thus be blocked
by the addition of chloride anion, which serves to induce a
conformational change to the cone-like form as shown in Fig. 1.
The 1,3-alternate conformation of receptor 4 binds a number of
electron-deficient guests in a 1 : 2 host–guest stoichiometry.
The resulting complexes adopt sandwich-like structures with
stabilisation provided via D–A–D-based CT interactions (Fig. 2).
A characteristic intermolecular CT band at lmax = 677 nm in the
Vis-NIR absorption spectrum, was observed when 4 was treated
with TNB and related explosive materials in CH2Cl2 at 298 K.
Addition of Cl anion was found to trigger conversion to the
cone conformation and release of the guest.

calix[4]pyrrole

Compound 4 was also found to bind well 1,4,5,8-naphthalene-
tetracarboxylic dianhydride (NDA). As true for the poly-
nitroaromatic explosives noted above, a 1 : 2 (receptor : guest)
stoichiometry was observed in organic solvents in the absence
of a coordinating anion, such as Cl.33 Absorption data from a
spectroscopic titration carried out in CH2Cl2 was fitted to a two-
site Adair equation; this provided two microscopic binding
constants, K1 = 2.9  104 M1 and K2 = 1.0  106 M1,
respectively, (Ka = 2.9  1010 M2) in the case of NDA. A reverse
fluorescence-based titration provided support for the high
aﬃnities, which proved to be the highest reported at the
time for a TTF-calixpyrrole macrocyclic host and a guest.
Another two TTF-based calix[4]pyrroles, viz. 5 and 6, were also
described34 and their ability to bind nitroaromatic explosives,
including TNB, picric acid (TNP) and 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene
(TNT), was explored. A careful analysis of the colourimetric
changes observed when TNB, TNP and TNT, were allowed to
react with 5 and 6 in CHCl3 revealed a positive homotropic
allosteric eﬀect (i.e., K1 o K2).34 Fig. 3 illustrates the proposed
origin of this positive homotropic allosteric eﬀect observed in
the case of receptors 4 and 5 with NDA and TNP, respectively.
Briefly, binding of the first guest leads the inherently flexible
host systems to adopt a 1,3-alternate conformation. This results

in formation of a preorganised structure that is able to encap-
sulate more eﬀectively the second guest molecule. A summary
of the binding parameters derived from quantitative analyses of
visible spectroscopic titration data is provided in Table 1.
Several reports have appeared35,36 of molecular devices that
exploit the positive homotropic allosteric binding features that
receptor 4 displays towards electron poor aromatic guests. The
systems in question proved capable of eﬀecting the stand-oﬀ
detection of nitroaromatic explosive vapours. In fact, a detection
limit of less than 10 ppb of TNB vapour was achieved using a
polymer microcantilever system.35
Recently, Flood and co-workers reported37 a more eﬃcient
detection technique for nitroaromatic explosives that is based
on the use of a ‘‘turn-ON’’ resonance Raman spectroscopic
signal. These researchers exploited the CT chromophore that
arises from the host–guest supramolecular complexation of
4 with e.g., TNB by exciting the complex with a laser at
l = 785 nm. According to the authors, this approach allows
for the selective and efficient detection of nitroaromatic explosives
with a fingerprint unique to the specific substrates. Solution and
solid state measurements of the host–guest chromophore com-
plexes revealed that the signal strength of the nitro groups being
monitored is increased by a factor of 10–20 relative to the isolated
nitroaromatic
analytes
as
the
result
of
supramolecular
complexation. The significant enhancement of the intensity
(Fig. 4) of the nitro group vibrations arising from complexation
is ascribed to a constructive resonance between the applied
785 nm laser light and the CT chromophore of the complex
(i.e., 4TNB2). This report represents an important step forward
in that it shows that a properly constructed TTF-based receptor
combined surface-enhanced spectroscopic techniques may
provide a means for detecting nitroaromatic explosives with
increased sensitivity and selectivity. As might be expected, addition
of a Cl anion salt regenerates the cone-like conformation. This
expels the TNB guest and constitutes a stimulus-induced change
that in principle sets up the system for further use or reuse.
3.3.
TTF-based calix[4]pyrroles for sensing spherical guests
Sessler and Jeppesen et al. also reported a self-assembled
multicomponent molecular host system38,39 based on 4 that
was found to interact with the electron-deficient acceptor C60
in the presence of chloride anion. It was demonstrated that
no significant absorption was observed for receptor 4 or the C60
guest molecule in CH2Cl2 beyond lmax Z 550 nm. However,
when C60 was added to receptor 4 in the presence of a Cl anion
source, the colour of the solution was found to turn green
immediately on the laboratory time scale; this change in colour
was ascribed to conversion of the initial 1,3-alternate structure to
the corresponding bowl shaped cone conformer and formation of
an ordered multicomponent supramolecular ensemble.
The absorption spectrum of the complex, which was subse-
quently assigned as C60C4Cl, is characterised by a strong
CT band with a lmax = 725 nm (Fig. 5a, curve iv). In contrast,
the addition of two equiv. of receptor 4 in its anion-free
1,3-alternate conformation to a solution of C60 in CH2Cl2

produces a brown solution. This solution is characterised by
the presence of a weak, broad absorption band centred at lmax =
748 nm (e = 500 M1 cm1) in the visible spectral region
(Fig. 5a, curve iii). Such features are consistent with only
minimal intermolecular interactions between C60 and 4.
However, the addition of five equiv. of tetrabutylammonium
chloride (TBACl) as a Cl source to this mixture of 4 and C60
resulted in an instantaneous colour change from brown to
green and the appearance of a strong CT absorption band
(Fig. 5a, curve v) centred at lmax = 725 nm; e = 1900 M1
cm1). Such a finding provides support for the proposal that
C60 is only encapsulated after 4 undergoes a change from the
1,3-alternate conformation to the corresponding chloride-
bound cone conformation (i.e., 4Cl). Single crystal X-ray
diﬀraction analyses of crystals grown in the presence of tetra-
octylammonium chloride (TOACl) provide support for the
proposed 1 : 1 binding stoichiometry between receptor 4 and
the C60 guest yielding a complex with the empirical formula
(TOA)[C60C(4Cl)]. A view of this supramolecular complex is
provided in Fig. 5b.
Jeppesen, Guldi and Sessler et al. reported several environ-
mentally responsive, multicomponent supramolecular switching
devices made up from receptor 4 and judiciously chosen neutral
guest molecules.40,41 The guests used for these studies included
planar or quasi-planar nitroaromatic guests, such as TNB (A),
methyl-2,5,7-trinitrofluorenone-4-carboxylate (B), methyl-2,5,7-
trinitrodicyanomethylenefluorene-4-carboxylate (C) as well as
the spherical substrates fullerene C60 (D) and its derivative
N-methylfulleropyrrolidine (E) (cf. Scheme 1).
To investigate the eﬀect of the individual chemical inputs, C
and E were added to the receptor system 4 in the absence as
well as in the presence of anions. It was observed that, after
addition of 2.0 molar equiv. of A (0.8 mM) and 0.5 equiv. of E
(0.2 mM) to a 0.4 mM CH2Cl2 solution of receptor 4, the colour
changed from yellow to brown almost instantaneously on the
laboratory time scale. This visual colour change was ascribed to
the formation of a complex, C2C4, wherein receptor 4 resides
in its 1,3-alternate conformation. The absorption spectrum of
this presumed complex displayed CT bands centred at lmax =
525, 720 and 1220 nm (e = 3700, 2000 and 2800 M1 cm1),
respectively.40 Addition of 2 equiv. of a chloride anion source to
this solution results in a conformational change of the receptor
4 from the 1,3-alternate to the corresponding cone conforma-
tion 4Cl. As a consequence, the 2 : 1 complex C2C4 breaks up
and is replaced by a 1 : 1 receptor–fullerene stoichiometry with
an empirical formula of EC4Cl (Scheme 1).

involving supramolecular ensembles formed between
TTF-based calix[4]pyrroles and electron-deficient guests
Anion-mediated reversible electron transfer (ET) in a synthetic
TTF-calix[4]pyrrole based host–guest assembly was reported
by Sessler and co-workers.42 As with other calix[4]pyrrole
ensembles, in this case anion binding to receptor 4 stabilises
a cone conformer that can act as a receptor for large cationic
guests, i.e., the electron-deficient benzimidazolium quinone
(BIQ2+). The resulting complex undergoes intra-ensemble thermal
electron transfer to produce a long-lived charge separated (CS)
state. Based on an X-ray structural analysis, this supramolecular
capsule is best described as a tightly coupled biradical species,
[4]2+BIQ+2Cl, wherein two cone-like anion-bound conformers
of 4 (one of which is oxidised by one electron) serve to encapsulate
the one-electron reduced form of the guest, BIQ+ (Fig. 6).
Another example of anion induced reversible ground state
electron transfer involving receptor 4 was also demonstrated43
by Fukuzumi, Kim and Sessler et al. using Li+@C60 as the
electron acceptor. In this three-component supramolecular
system, the ET is switched ‘‘ON’’ upon addition of a Cl anion
source to the host 4 with Li+@C60. However, addition of the
tetraethylammonium cation (TEA+ as, e.g., TEACl) introduces a
relatively small cation that acts as a competitive inhibitor for
the Li+@C60 guest. This latter species is thus excluded from the
cavity, resulting in eﬀective switching ‘‘OFF’’ of the ET event.
Photoinduced electron transfer (PET) from an electron-rich
TTF-calix[4]pyrrole, 5, to a porphyrin carboxylate, PA, within a
supramolecular triad (Fig. 7a) was also reported.44 Here, TEA+

was chosen as the counter-cation to the carboxylate moiety.
As above, this cation is bound inside the cavity of 5 when it is
in its cone conformation (as induced by carboxylate anion
complexation to the calix[4]pyrrole NH protons). This dual
binding, involving the complexation of both TEA+ and the
carboxylate moiety to receptor 5, was expected to enhance the
interaction between the PA and 5 leading to stronger supra-
molecular complexation. Laser photoexcitation of this supra-
molecular complex results in formation of a triplet CS state
composed of a TTF+ radical cation and a radical anion PA.
Another example of a three component supramolecular
ensemble undergoing photoinduced electron transfer (PET)
was also reported (Fig. 7b).45 In this case, Li+@C60 was used
in conjunction with 5 and a diﬀerent porphyrin carboxylate
anion, PA2. Photoexcitation of the three component mixture
results in PET from the triplet excited state of PA2 to 5+.
A characteristic signal at 1035 nm in the Vis-NIR absorption spectra
is consistent with the formation of a CS species, 5+/Li+@C60,
where the PA2 is in its neutral form. These findings were taken as
support for the conclusion that the three components undergo self-
assembly to produce a multi-component redox active ensemble.

Recognition of explosive materials and other electron
deficient guests within ‘‘Pacman’’ type receptors
The TTF-calix[2]thiophene[2]pyrrole (7) is another macrocyclic
host system reported by Sessler et al.46 This receptor was found
to bind certain electron-deficient planar guest molecules in
a Pacman-like fashion (Chart 2). The system acts as a chemo-
sensor and, in analogy to what was seen for 4, gives rise to a
readily visible colour change in the presence of nitroaromatic
analytes, such as TNB and picric acid. A solid state structural
analysis of one such host–guest supramolecular complex
(Fig. 8a and b) established a ‘‘cleft-like’’ arrangement wherein
the two TTF units lie parallel to one another and are separated
by approximately 3.44–3.56 Å.
Jeppesen et al. reported47 a TTF-calix[2]pyrrole[2]thiophene
hybrid system, 8, wherein two thiophene moieties are incorporated
into the central macrocyclic skeleton. This system was found to
act as a molecular receptor for another planar guest, namely
7,7,8,8-tetracyano-p-quinodimethane (TCNQ). Again, a Pacman-like
binding arrangement was seen in the solid state (Fig. 8c and d).

So-called exTTF systems are the conceptual analogues of TTF
moieties wherein the electron rich dithiolylidene subunits are
separated from one another. However, in contrast to the nearly

planar geometry generally displayed by the TTF subunit, exTTF
molecular motifs are often highly distorted and saddle-
shaped.15,48,49 These unique molecular geometries make exTTF
systems attractive as potential receptors for suitable spherical
guests, such as C60. Interestingly, a one-step two-electron
oxidation process results in the production of exTTF2+ and a
planarisation of the anthracene core bearing the two orthogonal
dithiolium moieties at its 9 and 10 positions. This change is
accompanied by an inferred gain in aromaticity. On this basis, it
was considered likely that this exTTF could act as a potential
donor in analogy to what is seen for other conventional donors,
e.g., porphyrins, ferrocene, aniline derivatives and p-conjugated
oligomers, whose oxidation leads to loss of aromaticity. In this
section, we summarise the chemistry of anthraquinone-based
exTTF systems, as well as that of super-p-extended tetrathiafulva-
lene- (sExTTF-) molecular systems.
4.1.
Crown ether fused exTTF macrocyclic systems
Crown ether annulated exTTF compounds are a class of mole-
cular motifs that have been used for recognising and sensing
fullerenes, as well as metal cations. Bryce et al. reported several
crown ether annulated 9,10-bis(1,3-dithiol-2-ylidene)-9,10-dihydro-
anthraquinone exTTF (exTTFAQ) derivatives, e.g., 9a,b and 10a,b
respectively50,51 (see Chart 3), which could be used to sense the Na+
and Ag+ cations with selectivity over the Li+ and K+ cations. A solid
state crystal structure of 9b revealed a highly curved crown
ether–exTTFAQ p-molecular geometry (Fig. 9). It was also antici-
pated that compound 10a,b would possess an arc-shaped
conformation with a preorganised and rigid inner cavity; such
features were expected to enhance the binding of certain
cationic species via synergistic crown ether–cation and pcation
interactions (i.e., cooperativity).51 Detailed electrochemical studies
of both 9b and 10b revealed that the two-electron oxidation wave
anodically shifts (DEox
1 ) by up to 115 mV when titrated with silver
triflate, and 100 mV when titrated with the corresponding sodium
salt in MeCN. These changes were taken as evidence for efficient
transduction of the cation recognition process into a readily
monitored electrochemical event.
These exTTF-based derivatives display an additional one-
electron oxidation wave, which was not aﬀected by adding
cations. As proposed by the authors, this particular observation
reflects loss of the cations from the crown ether upon generation
of the dithiolium form. This observation was further supported by
Ohta and Fujimori et al., who reported52 that addition of alkali
metal salts to 11a and 11b significantly aﬀects their 1H NMR
spectra (CD3CN) in the neutral state. On the other hand, no
appreciable changes in the chemical shifts were observed when
alkali metal salts were added to the dicationic state. It was
suggested that because these crown ether annulated exTTF deri-
vatives allow for the spectrophotometric and electrochemical
sensing of metal cations, they could prove useful in the develop-
ment of chemosensor devices.
Another set of electroactive exTTFAQ derivatives, 12a,b, were
also reported by Bryce and co-workers.53 Single crystal X-ray
structural analyses revealed that the exTTFAQ moieties within
12a and 12b adopt saddle-shaped conformations as seen in the
case of compound 9b (cf. Fig. 9).
Zhao et al. reported54 a novel fluorescence chemosensor,
13, (Chart 3) made up of a bis-crown-annulated exTTFAQ
receptor and two anthracene fluorophores. A single crystal
X-ray diﬀraction structure revealed a geometry consistent with
a highly strained core (Fig. 10). Two crown ether moieties are
oriented in the same direction to form a molecular tweezer
that was deemed suitable for cation recognition. Fluorescence
spectral titrations provided support for this contention in
that receptor 13 showed high aﬃnities for large hard metal
cations, such as Ba2+ (Table 2). The proposed metal binding

mode and fluorescence switching mechanism are both shown
in Scheme 2.
Martı´n and co-workers reported55 an exTTF-based macro-
cyclic system 14 that was found to form pseudorotaxanes
through hydrogen bonding interactions with axles 15 and 16,
respectively (cf. Chart 4). The same research group also
described a terminally attached crown ether–exTTF hybrid
system56 18 that forms robust supramolecular self-assembled
ensembles involving the electron rich exTTF unit and the
complementary electron deficient C60 derivatives 16 and 17.
For instance, a strong binding was observed upon mixing 18
with 17 (log Ka E 6 in chlorobenzene (PhCl) or CHCl3 at 298 K).
This high affinity was ascribed to both complementary p–p
stacking between the concave exTTF unit and the convex fullerene
and hydrogen bonding between the crown ether moiety and the
ammonium counterpart of 17. Various spectroscopic and electro-
chemical measurements provided evidence for CT interactions
between the exTTF moiety and the C60 guest in the ground state.
Transient absorption spectroscopic measurements revealed the
photoinduced generation of charge separated (CS) species with a
lifetime value of 9.3 ps in PhCl.
Another interesting exTTF-bis(crown ether) derivative, 19a, was
reported57 by Martı´n and co-workers. This system recognises C60
as well as C70 eﬃciently by means of presumed cooperative p–p
and n–p interactions. Favourable geometrical (concave–convex)
and electronic (donor–acceptor) complementarity was proposed
to account for the observed ability to complex fullerenes strongly
(association constants reaching 107 M1 in benzonitrile (PhCN) at
298 K). Calculations were used to predict the geometries of 19a
when complexed with C60 and C70. The results, shown in Fig. 11,
reveal that the spherical fullerene guest is sandwiched by two
crown ether moieties with the exTTF motif serving to provide
outer ‘‘flanks’’. In the case of both C60 and C70, femtosecond laser
flash photolysis (lexc = 480 nm, PhCN) was found to induce
photoinduced electron transfer (PET) as inferred from the obser-
vation of transient species with spectral features corresponding to
exTTF+ and C60 (or C70). As noted by the authors, the ability
to support multi-redox processes within such supramolecular
ensembles could allow for the development of new artificial
photosynthesis systems.
Nierengarten, Guldi, Ortı´and Martı´n et al. studied a series of
exTTF systems incorporating various bis(crown-ether) moieties,
19c–f, with fullerene.58,59 This systematic study revealed that
the size of the crown ether played a role in regulating guest
binding and served to highlight the complementary role of
C–H  p interactions in the binding process as inferred from
theoretical calculations (Fig. 11). Rather high binding constants
were observed for the symmetrical bis(crown ether) derivatives
[e.g., log Ka(19c) = 4.8  0.9; log Ka(19d) = 6.9  0.2 in PhCl at
298 K]. A relatively strong interaction was also seen for the
simplest of these exTTF derivatives, 19b and C60 [log Ka(19b) =
3.3  0.4]. This stands in contrast to what is seen for pristine
exTTF, which does not significantly interact with fullerenes on
its own in PhCl solution.60 Transient absorption spectroscopic
analyses revealed the formation of radical ion pairs with life-
times ranging from 12 to 21 ps in PhCl. The energy minimised
geometries of these 1 : 1 complexes at the B97-D/cc-pVDZ level
are shown in Fig. 11.
A representative UV-Vis-NIR spectral titration involving 19a
with the gradual addition of C70 is reproduced in Fig. 12. The
evolution of a broad CT-like band approximately at 580 nm was
taken as evidence for formation of supramolecular complex
with an empirical formula of 19aC70.

ExTTF-based macrocyclic tapes
As noted above, no significant interaction between pristine exTTF
and fullerene was seen in PhCl solution. However, increasing
the number of exTTF units within a single molecular edifice
transforms the system into an eﬃcient fullerene host.61 For
instance, Martı´n et al. reported a series of macrocyclic receptors,
21–23 (Chart 5),62,63 synthesised from the precursors 20a–b,
featuring two exTTF units that form very strong supramolecular
complexes with C60. At the time of publication, the largest
association constant (logKa = 6.5) was thought to be one of the
highest for an all-organic C60 receptor system. Efforts were made
by this research team to fine-tune the macrocyclic bis-exTTF hosts
for C60 or C70 recognition through structural variations. On the
basis of preliminary molecular modelling results, they explored
various aromatic spacers (e.g., p-xylene, m-xylene and 2,6-dimethyl-
naphthalene), all of which were inserted synthetically between two
exTTF fragments. The exTTF subunits were further functionalised
with alkene-terminated chains of different lengths and then sub-
ject to ring closing metathesis using Grubb’s first generation
catalyst. This allowed access to nine receptors, 21–23 (Chart 5) in
a relatively straightforward synthetic manner.
Energy minimised (AMBER) structures of the supramolecular
complexes formed between 21a–c and C60 are given in Fig. 13.
These theoretical studies provided further support for the claim
that this class of receptors is able to encapsulate C60 well within
their central cavities. Moreover, these theoretical studies allowed
related systems, such as macrocycles 21b and 21c (whose sizes vary
by only two methylene units), to be compared as putative fullerene
(C60) receptors. As the result of these geometrical optimisation
studies (Fig. 13), it was inferred that the slightly smaller alkenyl
chain present in 21b allows the C60 guest to be constrained more
tightly. In fact, this system was found to bind C60 more effectively
(logKa = 6.5  0.5 in PhCl at 298 K) than its congeners 21a,c as
determined by UV-Vis spectroscopic titrations. Job’s plot experi-
ments provide support for the conclusion that receptor 21a forms
a 1:1 complex with C60, while C70 readily interacts with two
21a molecules (i.e., 2:1 complexation). The authors performed
thorough photophysical experiments by taking all these nine bis-
exTTF receptors, 21–23. As an illustrative example, Fig. 14 shows
the UV-Vis spectral evolution for receptors 21b, 22b and 23b,
respectively (one system from each series), upon the incremental
addition of C60 in chlorobenzene (PhCl) at 298 K. In each case, a
CT band centered at lmax E 425–430 nm was observed along with
an isosbestic point at E470–475 nm. This spectral signature is
thought to be due to the association of the C60 guest inside the bis-
exTTF-based macrocyclic tapes. The underlying binding constant
data supporting this conclusion are presented in Table 3.
The ability of compound 24 to undergo self-assembly was
demonstrated by Martı´n and co-workers.64 In this study, two
complementary units, i.e., C60 and an exTTF-based macrocycle

in a single molecular edifice, were found to interact with each
other through presumed p–p, CT and van der Waals interactions.
The monomer 24 was found to self-assemble (Fig. 15) in the gas
phase, in solution and in the solid state to form linear supra-
molecular polymers with a very high degree of polymerisation as
evidenced by large binding constant values (logKa = 5.1  0.5)
corresponding to the individual pairwise interactions.
Pe´rez et al. introduced a mechanically interlocked (MINT)
derivative of a single walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) con-
structed by means of 21a (cf. Fig. 16).65,66 This pseudorotaxane

was

via
the
ring-closing-
metathesis (RCM) of two terminal alkenes within a bis-exTTF
precursor (e.g., 20a) around the central SWCNT by means of
Grubb’s second-generation catalyst. Support for the proposed
structure came from high-resolution scanning tunnelling electron
microscopy (HR-STEM) (Fig. 16), as well as other spectroscopic
means. Once formed, this MINT proved quite stable, remaining
intact even after heating at reflux in tetrachloroethane (TCE) for
30 min. The authors also demonstrated that there is a substantial
CT interaction between the donor exTTF moieties and the SWCNT
acceptor upon photoexcitation.
A
super-p-extended
tetrathiafulvalene-
(sExTTF-)
based
macrocyclic tape, 25, (Chart 5) was reported67 by Morin et al.
This system contains two highly p-extended 9,10-bis(benzo-1,3-
dithiol-2-ylidene)-9,10-dihydroanthanthrene moieties. As true
for 24, this receptor was found to encapsulate C60 well. The
highly conjugated polycyclic aromatic cores present in receptor
25 allow it to act as a potential donor in forming supra-
molecular complexes with fullerenes. UV-Vis spectroscopic
titrations involving 25 and C60 in toluene allowed a 1 : 1
association constant, Ka = 1.2  104 M1 to be calculated.
Several related studies were carried out (cf. Table 4). They
revealed that the binding aﬃnities increase with increasing
solvent polarity. The calculated selectivity factor Ka(C70)/Ka(C60)
for 25 revealed a preference for C70 over C60. This was ascribed

to relatively more favourable interactions between the egg-shaped
C70 than the spherical C60 and the aromatic polycyclic core of 25.
The Ka values were calculated using a standard nonlinear
least-squares fitting method and the values reported are the
average of the Ka values determined from DA measurements
carried out at 420 and 546 nm, respectively.
The presumed CT band near 600 nm seen upon formation of
the presumed 25C60 complex, was found to increase in intensity
upon exposure to ambient light. This result was thought to reflect
C60 sensitised photooxidation of the 1,3-dithiolylidene bonds
present in 25 (Scheme 3). A dependence on the light dose was
seen for this putative photo-oxidation process (Fig. 17).

ExTTF-based cyclotriveratrylene
Cyclotriveratrylene (CTV) derivatives (e.g., 26) are well known to
form ‘‘ball and socket’’ complexes with spherical guests such as
C60.68 de Mendoza et al. reported an exTTF–CTV hybrid system
(27)69 prepared by combining formally two different concave
molecular fragments (Scheme 4). This receptor system is charac-
terised by a preorganised bowl-shaped molecular geometry.
It was found to encapsulate both C60 and C70 well. The affinity
constants were found to rival the best seen for a purely organic
receptor system. For instance, the log Ka values for C60 and C70
binding were found to be 5.3  0.2 and 6.3  0.6, respectively, in
PhCl as inferred from UV-Vis spectral titrations.
Energy minimised structures inferred from DFT calculations
are shown in Fig. 18. These structures provide support for the
expectation that either C60 or C70 can be encapsulated within
this CTV receptor. The ability of system 27 to act as receptor
and sensor for fullerenes was confirmed by UV-Vis spectral
titrations (Fig. 19).

In analogy to what is true for TTF- and exTTF-based systems,
TTFVs are good electron donors that are characterised by rever-
sible electrochemical features. They also provide redox controlled
structural switching behaviour that mirrors that seen for many of
the exTTF systems.
These electron rich macrocycles were tested as receptors for
spherical guests, such as C60 and C70. A significant fluorescent
enhancement was observed when macrocycle 28b was treated
with these fullerenes in PhCl at 298 K. This makes this system a
rare example of a ‘‘turn-ON’’ fluorescent sensor for fullerenes.
The fluorescent enhancement was thought to reflect supramole-
cular interactions between TTFV and fullerenes, which block PET
processes that would otherwise serve to quench the fluorescence
emission. Molecular modelling studies led to the suggestion that
1 :2 host–guest complexes were being formed that are stabilised
by interactions between the extended p-cavity of macrocycle 28b
and the fullerene guests (Fig. 20). A characteristic CT band centred
at ca. 480 nm was observed for the resulting complexes. The
intensity of this absorption band increased with increasing
fullerene concentration (cf. Fig. 21a for studies involving C70).
Likewise, an increase in fluorescence intensity was seen upon the
incremental addition of C70 as shown in Fig. 21b. Given the basic
character of the TTFV moieties, the authors also evaluated the
impact of protonation and found that protonation (addition of
trifluoroacetic acid; TFA) could be used to engender fullerene
release from cyclophane 28b.
6. TTF-hemicarcerand and
TTF-carcerands
To date only a handful of TTF-fused redox active cage systems
viz. hemicarcerand and carcerands (Chart 7) have been
reported in the literature. The systems in question have yet to
be applied for any specific application. Nevertheless, their
preparation sets the stage for the construction of what may
emerge as the next generation of electroactive molecular
receptors. Among the most aesthetically appealing of the
TTF-based cage systems to be disclosed is the redox-active
hemicarcerand, 29, reported by Kaifer et al.71 This cage con-
tains four equatorial TTF subunits that serve to tether
covalently two cavitand moieties. As might be expected given
the presence of multiple TTF subunits, cage 29 displays multi-
electron redox character. Preliminary electrochemical analyses
revealed that the four TTF residues present in 29 behave indepen-
dently and thus act in essence like discrete TTF molecules.
Diederich and Echegoyen et al. reported72 the synthesis of the
novel resorcin[4]arene-based cavitands, 30a–c. These systems
feature two extended bridges consisting of quinoxaline-fused

TTF subunits. The authors found that, upon decorating both
the octol bowl and the TTF cavity rims with long alkyl chains,
the solubility in CH2Cl2 could be improved. Along with the bis-
TTF cavitands 30c, a minor amount of a novel highly strained
TTF-bridged cage compound 31b was also isolated (cf. Chart 7).
In the neutral form, cavitands 30a,b were expected to adopt
vase-like conformations. In contrast, upon oxidation, an open
kite-like geometry was expected to dominate due to Coulombic
repulsion between the two oxidised cationic TTF moieties
(Scheme 5). Cyclic voltammetric (CV) and diﬀerential pulse
voltammetric (DPV) analyses provided support for this proposed
vase - kite conformational switching in the case of 30a. It was
proposed that this distinctive change in the form of a molecular
receptor could allow for the capture a particular guest and then its
subsequent release via simple electrochemical means. As yet, this
promise has not been realised.
7. TTF-based calixarenes
Calix[4]arenes are another class of macrocycles that are recog-
nised for their ability to exist in both limiting cone-like and
1,3-alternate conformations.73–75 This is an attribute that has been
specifically exploited to create hybrid calix[4]pyrrole–calix[4]arenes
assemblies.76–78 An advantage of the calix[4]arene platform
relative to other macrocyclic receptor classes is that functiona-
lisation of the upper and/or lower rims surrounding the
hydrophobic cavity is straightforward. This has permitted con-
struction of a variety of derivatives, many of which have been
explored as potential receptors for various guests. A subset of
these efforts has focused on combining TTF unit(s) with
calix[4]arene moieties to produce compounds such as 32–44
(Chart 8) that show promise as electroactive functional
materials.79–91 The underlying syntheses have involved either:

(i) peripheral substitution of a single calix[4]arene core with
either one TTF unit (e.g., 34, and 37a,b) or multiple TTF units

36
and
39a–c),
or

bridging
two
calix[4]arene moieties through one (e.g., 40a,b, 41a–f) or two
(e.g., 35 and 38) TTF(s) units. TTF-based thiacalix[4]arene
assemblies 42a,b, 43a,b and 44a,b have been also synthesised
using similar strategies.
Despite their promise, to date, only a few examples of
TTF-based calix[4]arenes have been reported as being eﬀective
as receptors for either electron-deficient guests or anions. As an
illustrative example, Azov et al. reported a molecular tweezer
33b,80,82 wherein two cofacial electron rich monopyrrolote-
trathiafulvalenes (MPTTFs) are peripherally attached to the
upper rim of calix[4]arene scaﬀold. Due to the quasi-parallel
alignment of the two MPTTF units, 33b is endowed with a
binding site for electron deficient planar molecules. In fact, a
high aﬃnity for TCNQ was observed (Ka = 2.5  105 M1 in
CH2Cl2 at 298 K as determined by UV-Vis spectral titration). The
formation of host–guest complex was evidenced by the gradual
appearance of an intense CT band in the 600–900 nm spectral
region. The naked eye detection of TCNQ binding was also
possible since interaction leads to a visible colour change of the
CH2Cl2 solution from light yellow to deep green. Other electron-
deficient planar molecules, e.g., TNB and 2,4,7-trinitro-9-
fluorenylidenemalononitrile (TNF) were also found to bind well
to receptors 33a,b.80 Based on calculations, an intercalated
structure was proposed for the host–guest complex between
33a and TCNQ; it is shown in Fig. 22.
TTF subunits have also been attached to the calix[4]arene
scaﬀold via secondary amide linkers to give 3683 and 39c.84
In both cases, the incorporation of TTF subunits onto the
periphery of the calix[4]arene macrocyclic core produces a
well-defined preorganised cavity that is able to bind test anions
via cooperative hydrogen bonding interactions involving the
secondary amide groups. Compound 36 was found to permit
the electrochemical sensing of the pyrophosphate anion
(HP2O7
3) in CH2Cl2 at 298 K (Fig. 23a). It is worth noting that
compound 39c was also tested as a possible electrochemical
sensor for the H2PO4
 anion in a mixed CH3CN–CH2Cl2 medium
at 298 K (Fig. 23b). Contrasting electrochemical behavior was seen
during the electrochemical titration of 36 and 39c with anionic
guests. In the case of H2PO4
, a significant cathodic shift of the
first TTF oxidation potential was observed when 39c was used as a
host (Fig. 23b). This shift in potentials was ascribed to the
stabilisation of the anion-bound radical-cation species (TTF+)
generated by one-electron oxidation of the TTF subunit. In contrast,
titration of 36 with HP2O7
3 leads to an appreciable anodic shift
(DE1/2 = 453 mV) in the first TTF redox potential (Fig. 23a). This
unusual behaviour was rationalized in terms of charge transfer from
the propoxybenzenamine unit to the TTF moiety. This effect
disappears when an anion is bound.
The ability of 36 to act as an optical-based sensor was tested
by UV-Vis spectroscopic means. It was found that the most
significant change among the test anions studied was found in
case of HP2O7
3. The binding constants determined from
absorption spectroscopic titrations for various anionic species
in CH2Cl2 at 298 K are summarised in Table 5.
Salle´ and co-workers reported84–90 a series of calix[4]arene-
based molecular systems (37a,b, 38, 39a–c, 40a,b and 41a–f)
bearing pendant TTF units attached to the upper rim of a
calixarene core. The design strategy of these macromolecules is
based on the combination of three distinct components in a
single molecular scaffold, viz. a calix[4]arene moiety (to define
the spatial organisation), flexible polyethers or amide function-
alities (to provide a 3D binding site for alkali metals), and

electroactive TTF transducers (to allow the putative complexation
events to be monitored by electrochemical means).
Compound 39b was found to form dimeric [(TTF)2]+ and
(TTF+)2 species that could be disassociated upon Na+ binding.87
Specifically the dimerisation process was thought to be inhibited
by the recognition of the metal cation within the 3D pocket created
by the four neighbouring carbonyl groups present in 39b. On the
basis of a single crystal structure of the Na+ complex of 39b (shown
in Fig. 24), it is suggested that metal complexation to the lower rim
of the calix[4]arene core leads to a splaying out of two TTF units
that, in turn, inhibits strong interactions between TTF units.
Salle´ et al. used a series of bis(calix[4]crown)tetrathiafulvalene
receptor systems, 41a–f, to detect metal ions electrochemically.88,90
Single crystal X-ray diffraction analyses (cf. Fig. 25) provided support
for the notion that the metal ion (e.g., Na+) is coordinated within the
pockets formed at the lower rim of each calix-crown moiety.
The TTF-functionalised thiacalix[4]arenes, 42a,b, 43a,b and
44 (cf. Chart 8) were also reported recently.91 These molecules were
used to study metal ion-induced intermolecular ET processes in
the presence of an electron poor tetrachlorobenzoquinone (TCNQ)
guest in a 1:1 mixture of MeCN–CH2Cl2 at 298 K. In the presence
of metal ions, compounds 43a,b show more efficient ET as
compare to 42a,b, a finding that was rationalized in terms of the
presence of an extra TTF unit in 43a,b, which enhances the
interactions between the oxidized TTF (TTF+) and the tetrachloro-
benzoquinone radical anion (TCNQ).
8. TTF-based cages and cryptands
Cryptands are classic three dimensional macrobicyclic molecular
motifs that have been exploited for a range of ion binding
applications. By incorporating TTF motifs into cryptand-like
structures, a variety of systems can be synthesised that could
serve as electroactive host–guest receptors. With such considera-
tions presumably in mind, a series of TTF-based cages and
cryptands, 45–47, (Chart 9) with various spacers at the apical
positions, were designed and synthesised by Becher et al.92 These
molecular cages contain three individual TTF-bridges connected
to apical tripodal motifs; they were prepared using a high dilution
strategy that involved the selective protection–deprotection of
precursor TTF-thiolates.
A
pyrrolo-TTF
three
dimensional
belt
(48)
was
also
reported93 by Becher et al. The ability of this system to bind
TCNQ was investigated in solution using UV-Vis, 1H NMR and
electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopies. It was
observed that when 1 equiv. of TCNQ was added to a CH2Cl2
solution of 48 (2.5  104 M) an instantaneous visual colour
change from orange to green was observed on the laboratory
time scale. The appearance of two bands, centred at lmax 749
and 849 nm, respectively, in the UV-Vis spectrum (Fig. 26) was
thought to reflect a transfer of charge between 48 and the
bound TCNQ guest. Neither 48 nor TCNQ absorbs appreciably
beyond 600 nm. EPR spectroscopic analyses of 48TCNQ
recorded in CH2Cl2 revealed a radical signal at g = 2.009. The
line width and g-value are consistent with the presence of a

TTF+. These results thus support the assumption that charge
transfer between the host and guest takes place in solution.
That two CT bands were seen was ascribed to the possible
presence of two diﬀerent supramolecular binding modes in
solution, namely, an inside and an outside (alongside) binding
mode. However, a solid state X-ray crystal structure analysis of
the CT complex 48TCNQ revealed that in the solid state the
TCNQ is associated outside of receptor 48 (Fig. 27) adopting a
slipped sandwiched structure.
Two
novel
TTF-cages,
49
and
50,
containing
three
monopyrrolo-TTF (MPTTF) units were reported94,95 by Jeppesen
and co-workers. A single crystal X-ray diﬀraction analysis
(Fig. 28a) revealed that 49 is able to accommodate only solvent
molecules (CDCl3) as guests within its cavity. The system was
thus considered too small to act as a receptor for larger
substrates. Replacing the triethylbenzene ‘‘lid’’ of cage 49 by
a larger triarylethane ‘‘roof’’ led to cage 50, which was considered
appropriately sized to recognise C60. The formation of a strong 1:1
donor–acceptor (D–A) complex C60C50 was confirmed by a solid
state X-ray diffraction analysis (Fig. 28c), as well as by shifts in the
1H NMR and UV-Vis absorption spectroscopic features. A promi-
nent CT band (l = 735 nm, e E 840 M1 cm1) was observed when
1 molar equiv. of C60 was added to a CH2Cl2 solution of 50 (Fig. 29,
brown line). Replacing C60 by Li+@C60 led to a ca. 28-fold increase
in the binding affinity (Ka = 3.7  106 M1 vs. 1.3  0.6  105 M1
in CH2Cl2) and gave rise to a large bathochromic shift in the CT
band (l = 1104 nm, e E 4800 M1 cm1). The greater affinity seen
for Li+@C60 was rationalised in terms of enhanced coulombic
interactions relative to C60 within the corresponding complexes,
Li+@C60C50 vs. C60C50. PET was also seen upon photoexcitation
of Li+@C60C50; this was not observed for C60C50.
9. TTF- and exTTF-based metalla-
macrocycles and cages
The use of coordination driven self-assembly has allowed
chemists to synthesise inter alia a range of sophisticated
molecular polygons. In certain cases, this can be done in a
single step and in high yield.96–100 For many applications, the
design of stimuli-responsive receptors is critical. With such
considerations in mind, Salle´, Goeb and co-workers have been
working to prepare self-assembled metalla-cages based on
TTF-containing ligands. Particular emphasis has been devoted
to the use of precursors based on the bis(pyrrolo)TTF (BPTTF)
derivatives, (51,52), TTF-based tetrapyridyl ligand, 53 and 9,10-
bis(1,3-dithiol-2-ylidene)-9,10-dihydroanthracene
(exTTF)
motifs
(54–56) (Chart 10).
9.1.
BPTTF-based metalla-macrocycles and cages
An eﬃcient way to generate metalla-macrocycles involves the
use of a rigid linear ligand (e.g., 4,40-bipyridine) in conjunction
with a square-planar cis-blocked metal (M) complex (e.g., with
M = Pd2+ or Pt2+) in accord with the procedures pioneered by
Fujita101 and Stang.102 Such an association is likely to produce a
molecular
square.
Nevertheless,
complexation-based
self-
assembly is often accompanied by the formation of entropically
favourable triangular homologues, in particular, when the
ligand is either elongated or not suﬃciently rigid.103,104

When the cis-blocked square planar Pt(dppp)(OTf)2 complex
[dppp = 1,3-bis(diphenylphosphino)propane] was treated with
the rigid rod shaped BPTTF ligand (51), a self-assembled molecular
triangle (57) and a molecular square (58) were produced (Scheme 6)
in 60% and 31% yields, respectively.105,106
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) analyses revealed that, as true for
the isolated parent BPTTF unit, each BPTTF unit in 57 and 58
can be independently oxidised via two successive reversible oxida-
tion steps. Therefore, it is possible to generate in a controlled way,
species with six and eight positive charges directly on the cavity
panels in the case of 57 and 58, respectively.
Among these two self-assembled polygons, the triangular
analogue 57 was considered appropriately sized to encapsulate
C60 (cavity diameter = 13 Å). The ability of 57 to interact with C60
was monitored by means of UV-Vis spectroscopic titrations.
This allowed a binding constant of log Ka = 4.2 (CS2/CH2Cl2 :
8/2 v/v) to be calculated as determined using the Benesi–
Hildebrand equation for a 1 : 1 complexation event. This ability
to bind C60 was ascribed to the combined effect of van der
Waals and p–p interactions, as well as the preorganised nature
of the host. It is worth noting that no appreciable binding of C60
was seen in the case of the larger homologue, i.e., square 58.
The BPTTF molecular skeleton was functionalised in the a
positions of the pyrrole ring to produce the tetratopic ligand 52.
When this latter ligand was allowed to react with a cis-coordinated
square-planar Pt(II) complex (cf. Scheme 7), a three dimensional
polycationic metalla-cage 59 was produced.107,108 A 1H DOSY NMR
spectroscopic study was carried out and provided support for the
conclusion that only a single discrete ensemble was formed as the
result of this reaction.
CV studies revealed two successive oxidation processes. This
was taken as evidence that the three redox active BPTTF units that
make up the panels of 59 act in an electrochemically independent
way. The potentials are shifted anodically relative to those of the
parent BPTTF unit (for 59: E1
ox = +0.43 V and E2
ox = +0.62 V vs. Fc/Fc+;
for BPTTF: E1
ox = 0.02 V and E2
ox = +0.23 V vs. Fc/Fc+ in DMF, using
0.1 M NBu4PF6 as the electrolyte). These shifts were attributed to a
combination of electronic and structural eﬀects: (i) metal coordina-
tion serves to decrease the donor character of the BPTTF core and
(ii) this eﬀect is amplified by the co-planarity between the pyridine
coordinating groups and the BPTTF backbone. Evidence for this
latter co-planarity came from a solid state single-crystal X-ray
diﬀraction analysis of 59 (Fig. 30), which also served to confirm
its overall structure.
The trigonal prismatic structure found in the solid state led
the Angers research group to explore the possibility of using 59
to encapsulate electron deficient guests. Particular success was
encountered in the case of tetrafluorotetracyano-p-quinodi-
methane (F4TCNQ), which was found to form a 1 : 1 adduct
with 59 as evidenced by a Job plot analysis involving UV-Vis
spectroscopic titrations.107 When 59 was titrated with F4TCNQ,
new absorption bands appeared that were attributed to for-
mation of F4TCNQ and BPTTF+ radical species. The driving
force for complex formation was thus ascribed D–A type p–p
interactions between the BPTTF host and the F4TCNQ guest.

synthesised. An X-ray diﬀraction analysis of 53 revealed that the
four pyridine nitrogen atoms define a rectangle of 6.7  13.1 Å
(Scheme 8).109 However, two pyridyl units are rotated with
respect to the TTF plane. This is thought to result in a moderate
delocalisation of p-electron density between the electron-rich
TTF unit and the electron-withdrawing pyridine motifs present
in 53. Nevertheless, the p-donating character of the constituent
TTF unit was expected to be largely preserved in the case of 53,
in contrast to what was expected for the tetrapyridyl-BPTTF
ligand 52.
Ligand 53 reacts with cis-M(dppf)(OTf)2 complexes (M = Pt2+
or Pd2+; dppf = 1,10-bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene; OTf =
trifluoromethane-sulfonate)

electroactive M8L4 type metalla-cycles, 60a,b (Scheme 8).109
The electrochemical properties of these two representative
systems, 60a and 60b, were compared with those of ligand 53
by means of cyclic voltammetric analyses (Fig. 31).
As compared to the oxidation potentials of free ligand 53,
after metal complexation, a slight positive shift (e.g., for 60a,
DE1
ox = +0.16 V and DE2
ox = +0.10 V in CH3CN/CH2Cl2) was seen
in the redox wave ascribed to the TTF unit. A third reversible
oxidation wave was observed at a higher potential, which
corresponds to the simultaneous oxidation of the eight ferro-
cene units (dppf) situated at corner of the cage. Therefore,
based on these data it is possible to tune the global charge of
cages 60a,b electrochemically, over a remarkably wide window,
namely from species bearing 16 to 24 positive charges. The
same TTF-based ligand 53 was also found to undergo self-
assembly when treated with dinuclear p-cymene ruthenium
complexes.110 In particular, the metalla-cage 61 could be
produced. In this system the presence of two cofacial TTF units
limits the size of the cavity and no evidence of guest binding
was seen.
9.3.
ExTTF-based metalla-cages
Due to its unique structural and electronic properties, 9,10-
bis(1,3-dithiol-2-ylidene)-9,10-dihydroanthracene (exTTF) has
attracted attention recently.15,111–113 Although, exTTF adopts a
butterfly shape in its neutral state, presumably as the result of
1,5-interactions between the S atoms of the 1,3-dithiolylidene
moieties and the periplanar dihydroanthracene hydrogen
atoms, its corresponding dicationic species displays two aro-
matic 1,3-dithiolium rings connected to the central aromatic
anthracene moiety. The latter state can be accessed via a two-
electron oxidation process. This oxidation is characterised by a
single pseudo-reversible oxidation wave, located at Eox =
0.04 V (vs. Fc/Fc+), under conditions of cyclic voltammetry.
However, a lack of electrochemical reversibility is usually seen,
a finding ascribed to the drastic conformational change that
occurs upon oxidation. These features prompted efforts to
incorporate the exTTF subunit into metalla-cages. With such
a goal in mind, Goeb, Salle´ and co-workers reported a series
of self-assembled metalla-macrocyclic molecular receptors con-
structed from the redox active exTTF tetrapyridyl ligands 54 and
55 (Scheme 9).114–118
Reaction of ligand 54 with cis-M(dppf)(OTf)2 (where, M = Pd2+ or
Pt2+) complexes (Scheme 9 and Fig. 32) produced the large metalla-
macrocyclic M4L2
8+ systems 62a,b, in which the internal cavity is
bridged by two concave redox active electron donating exTTF
units.114 Container 62a and 62b allowed for the complexation of
one perylene guest with 1:1 binding stoichiometries Ka = 3.9 
103 M1 and 3.2  103 M1, respectively, in CD3NO2 as determined
from 1H DOSY NMR spectroscopic titrations.
Eﬀorts to produce similar self-assembled metalla-cages
using the cis-blocked complex Pd(en)(NO3)2 [where, en = ethylene-
diamine] likewise aﬀorded one unique discrete compound (64).116
Complex 64 was considered to be larger than 62a,b as inferred
from the diﬀusion coeﬃcient measured by
1H DOSY NMR
spectroscopy. A solid state structural analysis of 64 (Fig. 33a)
provided support for the formation of a self-assembled system
with a generalised empirical formula of M6L3
12+. The fact that
diﬀerent discrete metalla-cage species are formed under similar
conditions illustrates the crucial role of the metal complex, and in
particular the metal co-ligand, in directing the self-assembly
process (Fig. 33b and c).

The Salle´ group also designed ligand 55, which incorporates
four triethylene glycol monomethyl ether (TEG) chains. This
functionalisation
oﬀers
advantages
in
terms
of
forming
metalla-cages: (i) the TEG chains result in a higher solubility,
which allows a greater range of experimental conditions to be
explored in the context of self-assembly and facilitates host–
guest studies and (ii) the p-donor character of the ligand and of
the corresponding cage cavity is increased as the result of
a donating mesomeric effect promoted by the oxygen atoms
directly linked to the dihydroanthracene skeleton. Ligand 55
self-assembles (Scheme 9) in the same way as 54 in the presence
of cis-Pd(dppf)(OTf)2 to afford the M4L2
8+ cage 62c in near-
quantitative yield.115 The cavity of 62c is similar in size to that of
62a, and so is its ability to bind flat polyaromatic species.
As expected for a system bearing pendant TEG groups, oxidation
of both ligand 55 and cage 62c occurs at lower potentials than for
the homologous ligand 54 and analogous cage 62a, respectively.
As a result of the rather unique combination of electronic and
conformational features of framework, 62c (i.e., good p-donating
ability and drastic conformational changes that occur upon oxida-
tion), reversible disassembly–reassembly of the redox-active cavity is
observed upon successive chemical oxidation and reduction.

Of interest is that the positively charged Pd2+ centres are
located on the ‘‘equator’’ of the ovoid cavity. Therefore, it is
considered likely that these charges can contribute directly
to the binding of anionic species. In the case of the large
and spherical dodecafluorododecaborate anion (B12F12
2),
evidence in support of this notion came from
19F DOSY
NMR experiments carried out in CD3CN solution and solid
state X-ray diﬀraction analyses (Fig. 34a and b). Remarkably,
the reversible redox-triggered disassembly noted in the case of
the free cage 62c, could also be eﬀected in the case of the
(B12F12
2)2C62c host–guest complex. This system might thus
offer a new option for the redox-based binding and controlled
release of guests.
An important issue in host–guest chemistry concerns the
binding of neutral guests. Typically, this presents a greater
challenge than the recognition of ionic species due to the
inherent lack of coulombic interactions. Metalla-cages obtained
through the coordination-driven self-assembly are predominantly
polycationic species. This and the presence of coordinated coun-
ter anions can limit the ability of such species to act as receptors
for neutral guests. In contrast, were they available, neutral
metalla-cages might allow for the binding of non-charged sub-
strates. Efforts were thus made to obtain neutral metalla-cages
containing TTF subunits. By using specific Pd2+ or Pt2+-complexes,
i.e., cis-M(dctfb)2(cod), where, M = Pd2+ or Pt2+, dctfb = dichloro-
trifluorobenzene and cod = cyclooctadiene, in conjunction with
the tetrapyridyl ligand, 55, (Scheme 9), it proved possible to obtain
the neutral M4L2 cages 63a and 63b, respectively. Both systems
were characterised in the solid state by single crystal X-ray
diffraction analysis (see Fig. 35 for a view of the solid state
structure of 63a).117
While showing similar geometries and dimensions as the
polycationic cages 62c and 62d, the neutral cages 63a and 63b
diﬀer by the absence of counter anions. This matched set thus
oﬀered a unique opportunity to compare the binding ability of
ostensibly similar cages that diﬀer only by the overall charge.
A comparative binding study involving the polycationic cage
62c and neutral cage 63a and various neutral polyaromatic
hydrocarbons was performed by means of
1H DOSY NMR
spectral analyses carried out in either a 4 : 1 or 1 : 1 mixture of
CD3NO2 and CDCl3 at 298 K. This study revealed that the
neutral hosts were much more eﬀective receptors for these
substrates under these experimental conditions (Table 6).
The electrochemical properties of the neutral cages 63a,b
were studied and compared with those of ligand 55 (Fig. 36).118
As expected given the presence of coordinated metal centres,
higher oxidation potentials are seen for the cages (e.g., DEox E
+0.28 V E +0.31 V relative to 55 in case of 63a and 63b,
respectively). Nevertheless, oxidation still occurs readily.

The electrochemical behaviour of the palladium cage (63a) and
of the platinum cage (63b) diﬀers from one another. Whereas, an
electrochemically irreversible oxidation of the exTTF derivatives
was observed for cage 63a, the platinum analogue (63b) exhibits a
quasi-reversible oxidation wave. On this basis, it was inferred that
in contrast to 63b, little cage disassembly takes place upon
oxidation of the neutral palladium cage (63a). The greater stability
seen in the case of 63b is attributed to the relatively more robust
nature of the pyridine–platinum coordination bond. In purely
operational terms this difference means that with 63b it is
possible to generate reversibly via oxidation, species with up to
four positive charges without destroying the assembly.
The neutral platinum cage 63b was found to act as an
eﬀective receptor for coronene, producing an overall neutral
1 : 1 complex as inferred from 1H NMR, FTIR, HRMS and fluores-
cence spectroscopic studies. Comparative spectroelectrochemical
analyses revealed that coronene binding and its electrochemical
complexation-expulsion depends on the overall charge state on
the cage. This led to the suggestion that the coronene is displaced
from the receptor by one or more anions once the host is oxidised.
Support for this conclusion came from DFT calculations.118
10. TTF-based metal–organic-
frameworks (MOFs) and covalent-
organic-frameworks (COFs)
10.1.
TTF-based MOFs
Metal–ligand coordination strategies provide promising approach
to constructing self-assembled three dimensional (3D) architec-
tures. These approaches do not yield discrete macrocyclic systems
or cages as discussed earlier. Rather, they create infinite cavities
(or channel) within the 3D network, which make these materials
of potential interest in the context of many applications, e.g., gas
storage, catalysis, guest separation etc. In fact, several examples of
3D MOFs based on TTF-functionalised multidentate ligands have
been reported in recent years.119–125 TTF-based building blocks
commonly used for this purpose contain either pyridine or
carboxylates as metal coordinating sites. Two tetratopic ligands
based on TTF tetracarboxylates are shown in Chart 11. A recent
review125 has highlighted various TTF-based coordination poly-
mers and discussed their potential applications. However, a brief
summary from the perspective of the TTF synthetic chemist is
deemed appropriate here.
Some of these TTF-containing MOF materials were demon-
strated to act as functional materials with interesting electronic
and magnetic properties. For example, Dinca˘ et al. reported
porous and conductive 3D MOFs (Fig. 37) based on the tetra-
topic ligand TTFTB that proved capable of eﬃcient ‘‘through-
space’’ intrinsic charge transport.120,121
In these M2(TTFTB) MOFs (M = Zn2+, Co2+, Mn2+ and Cd2+),
the non-covalent interactions (i.e., p–p stacking) are thought to
support efficient orbital overlap between neighbouring TTF
moieties that, in turn, provide an extended charge transport
pathway within the rigid MOF structure. Partial oxidation of these
materials leads to the production of TTF+ sites. This leads to
enhanced conductivity ranging from ca. 106 S cm1 for
Zn2(TTFTB) and Co2(TTFTB) to 105 S cm1 for Mn2(TTFTB) and
104 S cm1 for Cd2(TTFTB) at 298 K. The through-space charge
transport within these MOFs gives rise to charge mobilities that
range from 105–10 cm2 V1 s1. These values are comparable with
those recorded for other common organic semiconductors.
Dinca˘ et al. reported another TTF-based MOF (MIT-25),122
having the empirical formula, Mg2H6(H3O)(TTFTB)3. This par-
ticular MOF was prepared via the metal assisted self-assembly
of what are formally TTFTB molecular triads (cf. Fig. 38b).
A solid state X-ray structural analysis of MIT-25 revealed the
presence of three dimensional hexagonal mesoporous channels,
as well as smaller micropores that run parallel to the main
channels (Fig. 38a). DFT calculations allowed predictions of the
formation energies for the neutral dimer ([H4TTFTB]2), singly
oxidised dimeric ([H4TTFTB]2+) and trimeric ([H4TTFTB]3+)
species, respectively. The resulting values, viz. 1.62, 5.52 and
13.73 kcal mol1 for these three forms, respectively, led to the
prediction that even the oxidised trimer, [H4TTFTB]3+, is readily
accessible under conditions of mild oxidation (experimental
oxidation potential = +0.34 V vs. Ag/AgCl). This oxidised trimer
form is thought to provide electron holes that are fully delocalised
across all three TTF moieties (Fig. 38c). Likely as a result of these
features, MIT-25 exhibits temperature and humidity-dependent
proton conductivity.123

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopic (EIS) measurements
of MIT-25 revealed that at 40% relative humidity (RH) the proton
conductivity increased from 1.58  105 S cm1 at 298 K to 1.03 
104 S cm1 at 358 K, giving an Ea of 0.36 (0.0074) eV. At 95% RH,
the proton conductivity increased from 6.8  105 S cm1 at 298 K
to 5.1  104 S cm1 at 358 K, giving an Ea of 0.40 (0.0009) eV.123
This and related TTF-functionalised MOFs may thus have a role to
play as eﬃcient proton conductive materials.
Zuo et al. reported two three dimensional Fe(II)-based
MOFs124 constructed using the redox-active tetrakis(4-pyridyl)
tetrathiafulvalene precursor 53. These MOFs were found to exhibit
multifunctional magnetic, electronic and optical properties that
led to suggestions that they might be suitable for developing
electronic devices. It was observed that the Fe(II)-based MOFs
derived from 53 exist in the form of (4,6)-linked binodal sqc11-type
3D frameworks that undergo a crystal-to-crystal structural transfor-
mation upon iodine (I2) doping (Fig. 39). The I2-doped MOF not only
displays enhanced conductive properties (by 2–3 fold), but also
magnetic properties that differ from the undoped form.
Solid state electrochemical studies revealed that the redox
activity of the TTF moiety was maintained in both systems. The
initial sqc11-type 3D MOF demonstrates incomplete gradual
spin-crossover behaviour in accord with a ‘light-induced excited
spin-state trapping’ (LIESST) eﬀect at low temperature. It might
therefore see application as a photo- and electronically switch-
able spin crossover (SCO) material. Other electroactive coordi-
nation polymers based on either H4TTFTB or 53 have been
reported.126–128 Although further study is warranted, these
systems are expected to display interesting electrochemical,
magnetic, catalytic and gas adsorption properties.
10.2.
TTF-based COFs
In conjunction with the TTF-based MOFs discussed earlier, TTF
building blocks have also been used to synthesise conducting
materials based on covalent organic frameworks (COFs). This was
done via the controlled self-assembly of 2D-structures at the
atomic scale. In contrast to more conventional COFs possessing
lower levels of intra-plane p-conjugation,129,130 the TTF-based
COFs display features consistent with higher levels of conjugation
within the framework. This makes theses species attractive as
potential semi-conducting materials. Open nano-channels are
seen within the TTF-based COFs;131 this allows the incorporation
of molecular dopants, such as iodine (I2) or TCNQ, to enhance CT
interactions. Such additions leads to formation of a characteristic
mixed valence TTF species with good electrical conductivity.
A mechanistic rational for the electrical conductivity seen in the
case of TTF-COFs is shown in Fig. 40.
The first examples of TTF-based COFs were reported con-
currently in 2014 by three independent research groups.131–133
All of them used the same COF building block, viz. 2,3,6,7-

porous material, TTF-Ph-COF (Scheme 10). This was isolated in the
form of either thin films or solid crystalline materials.
Zhang, Liu and co-workers131 reported that the electrical
conductivity of a pristine TTF-Ph-COF thin film (1.2  104 S m1)
could be significantly enhanced to 0.28 S m1 upon exposure of
the material to I2 vapour. The resulting increase in the conduct-
ivity was attributed to eﬀective cross-layer radical delocalisation
within the mixed-valence TTF stacks present in what can be
viewed as being 2D grid-like sheets of the TTF-Ph-COF. UV-Vis-
NIR and EPR spectral analyses supported the formation of
oxidized (TTF+) subunits upon treatment with the I2 of dopant.
Further investigations by Wang and Zhang et al. revealed
that the conductivity of TTF-Ph-COF could be increased to 1.8 
106 S m1 upon extending the I2 doping time and upon raising
the temperature (Fig. 41).132
Jiang et al. reported133 another COF (TTF-Py-COF), obtained
under solvothermal reaction conditions. This COF was obtained
by heating 65 with 1,3,6,8-tetrakis(4-aminophenyl)pyrene (68) in
nBuOH/o-dichlorobenzene/3 M AcOH (Scheme 10). By comparing
TTF-Ph-COF and TTF-Py-COF insights into the role of the linker
were obtained. For instance, electrodeless flash-photolysis time-
resolved
microwave
conductivity
(FP-TRMC)
measurements
revealed that TTF-Ph-COF has a larger charge-carrier mobility
of 0.2 cm2 V1 s1 than TTF-Py-COF (0.08 cm2 V1 s1). The
conductivities of films containing these two TTF-COFs revealed
values of 105 S1 m1 and 106 S1 m1 for TTF-Ph-COF and
TTF-Py-COF, respectively. These diﬀerences were ascribed to
diﬀerences in packing within the respective layered structures
and the associated interlayer separations (cf. Fig. 42). These latter
values were predicted to be 3.71 Å for TTF-Ph-COF and 3.87 Å for

TTF-Py-COF as inferred from density functional tight binding
(DFTB) calculations.
Wang and Wan et al.134,135 provided experimental support
for these latter predicted values by carrying out on-surface high-
resolution scanning tunnelling microscopic (STM) analyses of
TTF-Py-COF and its higher analogue, TTF-Ph2-COF, obtained
from 65 and 1,10-biphenyl-4,40-diamine, 67 (Scheme 10). The
results provided direct support for the proposed eclipsed stacking
between the TTF-COFs.
11. TTF-catenanes and ‘‘molecular
machines’’
Catenanes (from the Greek ‘‘catena’’ meaning chain) are classic
molecular systems containing two or more interlocked rings,
which cannot be separated without the breaking of at least one
covalent bond. Numerous examples of catenanes have been
reported in recent years and the majority of those have been
constructed by taking advantage of supramolecular interactions to
promote their synthesis. A number of elegant catenanes incorpo-
rate one or more electroactive TTF units within their structures;
some classic examples, e.g., 69–79,136–142 are shown in Chart 12.
Many TTF-containing catenanes have been prepared with a
view towards creating molecular switches and machines. The
three possible redox states of the TTF unit, as well as the
typically reversible interconversion between these states, makes
TTF-containing catenanes and related mechanically inter-
locked molecules (MIMs) attractive for controlling molecular
movement and thus for the creation of devices that function at
the molecular level. In this section, we provide a brief summary
of TTF-based macrocycles that have been studied as potential
molecular switches and machines.
A number of [2]catenanes that incorporate both polyether-
bridged tetramercapto-TTF donor subunits and cyclic cyclobis-
(paraquat-p-phenylene) electron acceptor moieties have been
reported. Representative syntheses are shown in Scheme 11.
For example, treatment of the [2]pseudorotaxane 81 with the
diiodo glycol precursor 80 under high dilution condition in the
presence of a catalytic amount of base gives the Cu(I)-complex
of the catenane 69 as its hexafluorophosphate salt (i.e., 69Cu
PF6). Subsequent demetallation, involving treatment with KI,
gave the free form of the catenane (69; Scheme 11a).
The TTF group has also been used as a template to self-
assemble catenanes containing one or more cyclobis(paraquat-
p-phenylene) rings. For instance, mixing macrocycle 82, which
incorporates two TTF units, the horseshoe shaped dication 83
and 1,4-bis(bromomethyl)benzene under high-pressure condi-
tions (10 kbar) results in the formation of the corresponding
[2]catenanes 75 (Scheme 11b).
In 1998 Balzani, Stoddart, Venturi and Williams et al. reported139
the [2]catenane, 71 (Chart 12). This system incorporates a TTF unit
and a 1,5-dioxynaphthalene (DNP) moiety within one ring and a
cyclobis(paraquat-p-phenylene) acceptor as the other ring. It was
shown that 71 behaves as a redox-driven molecular machine
(Scheme 12) with the reversible redox features of the TTF unit being
used to control the requisite motion at the molecular level.
Specifically, it was demonstrated that, upon oxidation of the
TTF unit (by either chemical or electrochemical means), the
cyclobis(paraquat-p-phenylene) ring was forced to move from a
point close to the oxidised and positively charged TTF subunit
to near the DNP donor moiety. This conversion aﬀorded the
maroon coloured isomer 71b. Subsequent reduction was found
to regenerate the original dark green isomer 71a. The motion
could also be monitored by
1H NMR spectroscopy, UV-Vis
spectroscopy or cyclic voltammetry (CV).
Cooke and Stoddart et al. reported142 two donor–acceptor
based mechanically interlocked ‘molecular flasks’, 84 and 85
(Chart 13). These systems are [3]catenanes, comprised of two
identical macrocycles having either a TTF unit and a DNP
moiety (86) or a TTF and a butadiyne group (88) incorporated
in the same ring.

In both [3]catenanes, the two redox-active TTF subunits are
positioned within the same tetracationic ring (formally 87).
Upon oxidation these catenanes support the formation of stable
mechanically linked internal pseudo dimers of TTF (i.e., formal
(TTF)2+ and (TTF+)2 states respectively; cf. Fig. 43b and c) under
ambient conditions.
The high stability of the electrochemically accessible dimeric
states seen for 84 and 85 (Fig. 43) is ascribed to the underlying
MIM structures. The associated interlocking provides both an ideal
three dimensional geometric arrangement and enforces what are
eﬀectively ultrahigh local concentrations of the individual TTF
species. These dimerisation events represent an aﬃnity umpolung
in that the stabilisation provided by mixed-valence (TTF)2+ and
radical-cation (TTF+)2 states inside the ‘‘molecular flasks’’ serve to
replace more traditional TTF–bipyridinium interactions.
By replacing the DNP station with a butadiyne group it was
found that the distribution of states could be made to favour
further formation of the TTF radical-cation dimer state,
(TTF+)2, (i.e., from 60% to 100%). Support for this conclusion
came from a number of solution phase studies, including cyclic
voltammetry, spectroelectrochemistry, UV-Vis-NIR and EPR
spectroscopies, as well as solid state X-ray diﬀraction analyses
(cf., Fig. 44a and b). Accompanying DFT calculations provided
support for the notion that first paramagnetic mixed-valence
dimers are stabilised and that diamagnetic radical-cation dimers
are obtained upon oxidation of the [3]catenanes 84 and 85.
Continuous wave EPR (CW EPR) spectral studies of 84 and
85 under ambient conditions provided support for the stepwise
chemical oxidation of these [3]catenanes.143 This oxidation
triggers a number of chemical events, including the formation
of formal isomers as shown in Fig. 45.

In these studies, oxidation was eﬀected via the gradual
addition of Fe(ClO4)3. Formation of mixed-valence states of
845+ and 855+ were observed upon addition of 1.0 equiv. of this
chemical oxidant (Fig. 45a and d). Addition of 2.0 equiv. of the
oxidant produced notable changes in the EPR spectra of 846+
(Fig. 45b) and 856+ (Fig. 45e). In the case of 856+, attenuation
of the radical signal was seen, an eﬀect ascribed to the strong
spin-coupling between the two neighbouring TTF+ units.
However, in the case of 846+, only a minor decrease in the
EPR signal intensity was observed (cf. Fig. 45b). This disparity
was rationalised in terms of the presence of the EPR-active
species 84out
6+ where the individual TTF+ units (corresponding
to 86) are exposed outside the macrocyclic system formally
made up of 87. CV and UV-Vis spectral studies provided support
for the conclusion that once the corresponding 84in
6+ species is
generated in the medium (wherein individual TTF+ units of 86
are brought into close proximity within the macrocyclic system 87),
an equilibrium arises between 84in
6+ and 84out
6+. EPR analyses led
to the suggestion that the equilibrium distribution is approximately
60:40 in favour of the 84in
6+ state. Further oxidation of both
[3]catenanes, (i.e., 84in/out
6+ and 856+) with 4.0 equiv. of the oxidant
results in the formation of the corresponding fully oxidised EPR-
silent states 848+ (the gradual quenching of EPR signal is shown in
Fig. 45c) and 858+ (Fig. 45g), respectively.
Examples of TTF-bearing metallo[n]catenanes (where n = 2
or 3, respectively) have been reported recently.144,145 Here, the
basic design strategy has involved the use of metal–ligand
coordination with donor–acceptor supramolecular interactions
to drive catenane formation. Generally, Pd2+ or Pt2+ cations
have been employed in this regard so as to take advantage
of the square planar coordination geometries preferred by
these cations. Examples of the precursors and resulting
metallo[n]catenanes are provided in Chart 14.
Liu et al. reported a dynamic redox switch, 92, consisting
of a donor–acceptor metallo[2]catenane formed by the self-
assembly of a diimide-based metallomacrocycle, 894NO3

and a crown ether precursor 86. Switching in the form of self-
assembly and disassembly was demonstrated under conditions
of electrochemical control with the redox effects being ascribed
to the presence of the TTF moiety.144
Stoddart et al. reported145 mechanically interlocked TTF-
containing
frameworks
consisting
of
[3]catenanes
and
Solomon link isomers derived from precursors 86, 908PF6

and 91 (Charts 13 and 14). These systems were explored in
an eﬀort to determine the eﬀect of topology on the redox
states of closely interacting TTF subunits. It was found that
the three dimensional alignment of two electroactive TTF units
triggers the assembly of an organoplatinum molecular square
and directs the formation of two mechanical conformers
(Fig. 46).
The topological constraints present in the molecular Solo-
mon link introduce a high level of dynamic structural complex-
ity over the geometric changes that occur as the result of
electronic modulation of the TTF units within these catenanes.
Detailed electrochemical analyses revealed a fundamental rela-
tionship between topology and the redox properties of these
radically configurable isomers (i.e., 728+, 738+ and 71C708+).

12. Biological aspects of TTF-fused
systems
In living systems, including plants and animals, the active
transport of ions and molecules is necessary to create the
concentration gradients that underlie nearly all biological
activities. A recognised challenge for supramolecular chemists
has been to replicate this active transport using various artificial
molecular motifs. In this context, TTF functionalised mechanically
interlocked molecular systems (MIMs),146 artificial molecular
machines (AMMs),147 and other systems constructed by means
of either TTF or exTTF are attractive. This is because, at least in
principle, ion recognition and release could be induced by means
of electrochemical switching of the constituent TTF or exTTF
moiety. TTF-switching is also of interest in the context of
controlling the properties of systems designed to mimic other
important functions, such as charge capture and conformational
motion. Several promising TTF-based systems with potential bio-
logical ramifications have been described recently. None is macro-
cyclic in nature. Therefore, the work in question nominally falls
outside the scope of this review. However, since it sets the stage for
future progress, a brief summary is appropriate here.
Bio-inspired nanotubular cyclopeptidic heterodimers bearing
electroactive exTTF moiety were reported in 2007 by Brea, et al.148
and
put
forward
as
light-harvesting/light-converting
hybrid
ensembles. Such systems could function as possible switchable
ion transporters. The same is true for TTF-labelled oligodeoxy-
nucleotides, examples of which were reported by Fermı´n and co-
workers.149
In a separate line of investigation, Bancafort and Ribas
demonstrated that a self-assembled cofacial Zn(II)–porphyrin
nanocage could behave as a robust singlet oxygen (1O2) photo-
sensitiser with tunable features.150 In this study, the production of
1O2 was inferred through oxygenation of the exTTF-based coordi-
nating ligand 56 (cf. Chart 10).
Martı´n and co-workers reported151 a variety of electroactive
peptide-based exTTF derivatives that support the formation of
diﬀerent aggregated states depending on the environmental
conditions. It was found that formation of either a metastable
state or a thermodynamically favoured supramolecular polymer
could occur, with the product obtained depending on the concen-
tration and ionic strength of the medium. Electrochemical changes
involving the exTTF moiety provided another element of control.
Ultimately, these and other redox switchable systems could see use
as drug delivery agents or biomimetics of key regulatory functions.
This is an area that is still in its infancy. Much work remains to be
done. However, it is likely that the redox switching capability
provided by one or more TTF moieties incorporated into responsive
systems will help bridge the gap between fundamental chemistry
and biology in ways that might not yet be envisioned.
13. Conclusion and future prospects
This review article highlights recent work involving TTF-fused
macrocyclic systems. The host–guest interactions between TTF-
based calixpyrroles, macrocyclic tapes, cyclophanes, cryptands,
cavitands and metalla-cages with various guest molecules are
discussed. The electron donating ability of the TTF subunit has
been exploited in a number of supramolecular host–guest systems
and has given rise to the preparation of sensors, molecular switches
and catalysts for specific reactions. The charge transfer character
seen in the case of many TTF-macrocycle complexes allows for the
detection of numerous analytes, while the redox active nature of the
TTF subunit has provided the predicate for the construction of new
state-of-the-art systems capable of capturing and storing charge or
binding and releasing specific neutral guest through controlled
electrochemical switching. TTF-based mesoporous hybrid metal–
organic frameworks are now known, as are electroactive TTF-
containing systems that show promise for the construction of
electronic and spintronic devices. Developments in both synthetic
TTF chemistry and supramolecular chemistry have made it possi-
ble to construct many elaborate systems, with applications in the
chemical, physical and biological world. Much of the synthetic
effort associated with TTF-containing systems has been focused on
TTF-tetrathiolates on account of their facile preparation and strong
nucleophilicity. Recent access to pyrrolo-annelated TTFs possessing
strong p-donor properties offers additional opportunities for the
design and construction of redox active supramolecular systems.
To quote, Julius Rebek,152 ‘‘The question is no longer if something
can be built, but what to build and why’’. In this context, TTF-based
superstructures appear particularly promising. Nevertheless, a dee-
per understanding is still needed such that the control parameters
governing TTF-containing macrocyclic hosts can be fully exploited.
It is hoped that this review will provide an initial foundation for this
future understanding.
