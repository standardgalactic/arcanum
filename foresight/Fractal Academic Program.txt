Message from Director 
Fractal Academics  
At IITH we are exploring a new approach to structuring the academic curriculum. We grapple with many questions in 
educating our students:  lack of motivations among students, low attendance and uneven student interest.  Other challenges 
include:  the gulf between theory and practice, breadth vs. depth, and the relevance of non-core subjects. How do we tailor 
the curriculum based on individual potential? How do we make the curriculum interdisciplinary? How do we increase industry 
interactions? How do we incorporate research in under graduate curriculum? This list of questions is by no means exhaustive, 
and each question, perhaps, begets a thesis.  
In order to provide some resolution to these difficult questions, we first started with fractional credit courses. A typical 3-
credit course has 42 contact hours; we developed courses with 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, and 3 credits having 7, 14, 21, and 
28, 35 and 42 contact hours. The motivation was to atomize the teaching program and also involve industry partners in 
some aspects of academics.  The student enthusiasm, their commitment, and their output was very high in these courses. 
Based on the overall success of fractional credit courses, we developed a complete 4-year curriculum, referred to as Fractal 
Academics.  The core of fractal academics is that breadth courses are of 1 credit, while depth courses are typically of 1.5 
to 2.5 credits. In essence, we are atomizing the academic program, providing a more holistic education, and in the long run 
giving students the choice to design their curriculum. 
Fractal Academics was first implemented at IITH for the Electrical Engineering Department in Aug 2013. From Aug 2014 all 
engineering departments followed Fractal Academics. In 2016 Aug, Fractal Academics was also implemented at IIT Bhilai 
in Computer Science and Engineering, Electrical Engineering and Mechanical Engineering.  
Fractal Academics was developed by the faculty of IITH and it is to them the novel academic program owes its success. 
Also, the students of IITH deserve a very special thanks for experimenting with and accepting this novel program. 
Fractal Academics is constantly evolving based on feedback from students and faculty. We believe that it should evolve 
continuously and keep pace with changing times and changing aspirations of the students.

Introduction 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Fractal program at IITH atomizes the courses into breadth and depth, allowing the student to pursue 
interdisciplinary learning with a wide array of basic courses as well as pursue any subject in greater depth.

Perceived Role of Higher Education
- Convey knowledge
- Create knowledge
- Create and develop ideas
- Innovations
- Publish
- Develop future citizens
- Create a better society
Some Questions
- Does the curriculum need complete overhaul?
- What are the right models of teaching and learning now that the traditional lecture 
seems obsolete?
- Which students should be targeted?
- Just as we’ve seen the forces of technology and globalization transform sectors such 
as media and communications or banking and finance over the last two decades, 
these forces may now transform higher education.
- The traditional university is being unbundled
Some More Questions...
- Why the lack of motivation among students?
- Why the low attendance?
- Why the uneven student interest?
- How do we bridge the gulf between theory and practice?
- How do we bridge the gulf between breadth and depth?
- What is the relevance of non-core subjects?
- How do we have a flexible curriculum?
- How do we space the curriculum based on individual potential?
- How do we make the curriculum interdisciplinary?
- How do we increase industry interactions?
- How do we incorporate research in under graduate 
curriculum?
- Has the 3 credit hour system outlived its utility?

Philosophy: The new program should capture
- T-Education
- Breadth with depth
- Flexibility
- Foster interdisciplinarity
- Wider choice of electives
- Foster research at the undergraduate level
- Synergy in projects – hopefully leading to products
- Students can pace their program
- Greater choice for knowledge acquisition and specialization
- Encourage creativity
| Bouquet of courses in Creative Arts (music, movie making, fine arts, 
photo journalism, performing arts, etc.)
Initial Attempts: Fractional Credit Courses
- Strong industry interaction
- A typical 3 lecture course has 3 credits leading to 42 lecture hours in a 
semester.
- Fractional credits can be 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0 having 7, 14, 21, 28, 35 
and 42 lecture hours respectively.
- Some examples of fractional credit courses that were offered in the 2011-
2012 and 2012-2013 academic years are:
| Trends in Storage Systems (by NetApp)
| Mobile Applications (by Adobe)
| Data Management and Computing on the Cloud
| Empowering Three Billion (taught by former President Dr. Kalam)
| Finance and Economy
| Sales and Marketing
| Photo Journalism
| Movie Making
| Drama (Performing Arts)
| Courses by Visiting Faculty in Math and EE from the USA

Fractal Academic Program
- A novel academic program implemented at IITH – we believe it is first 
of its kind
- Atomize the courses and programs
- 1 credit courses for breadth
| Core courses
- 1.5, 2, 2.5 credit courses for depth
| Specialized courses
| Electives
| Projects and building prototypes / products
| Bridging gulf between theory and practice
1 Credit Courses
- Form foundation for the core courses
- Help interdisciplinary education
- Open to all students – allows for greater breadth
- Students have the option of greater number of interesting courses
- Allow students to better tailor their coursework and choose across 
Departments
- Large basket of non-technical courses (Liberal Arts + Creative Arts)
- Better access to a wide variety of courses increases exposure and 
preparedness for research
- Synergy in projects - foundation for product development
- A balance is sought between technical and non-technical courses to 
reduce stress when students enter IIT Hyderabad
- The first two semesters expose students to all the basic tools required for 
the rest of their Bachelors program
- The curriculum potentially makes students ready for internship right after 
the first year

Concluding Remarks
- This is just the beginning; a lot more needs to be done
- Need to think creatively and out of the box
- Fractal Academics is an evolutionary program
| Will need tuning with fast-changing times

1.1.  GLOSSARY OF TERMS  
• 
Credit: The quantitative measure of recognition given to a course, stated in semester hours. Typically, a theory 
course running for a full a semester with three contact hours per week would be 3 credits. Similarly, a lab course 
with the same number of contact hours would be 2 credits.   
• 
Major: The primary set of discipline-specific coursework pertaining to the student’s department/discipline   
• 
Minor: Additional basket of coursework done from a discipline different from the student’s original discipline (and 
would also find mention in the final degree) 
• 
Honors: Additional basket of coursework done in the same discipline as the student’s original discipline (and would 
also find mention in the final degree) 
• 
Double Major: Coursework pertaining to two departments/disciplines and leading to two separate degrees. 
• 
Additional Course: An additional course taken by the student over and above the minimum credit requirements 
of the degree.  
• 
Pre-requisite: The preliminary requirement, usually successful completion of another course, that must be met 
before a course can be taken. 
• 
Elective: Course chosen by the student and which would form part of his/her degree requirements.  
• 
Free Elective: A course of the student’s choice, to be selected from the any department (subject to meeting the 
pre-requisites)  
• 
Core Elective: A course of the student’s choice, to be selected from the same department (or offered by a different 
department, but identified as "core" by one's department) 
• 
LA/CA Elective: A course of the student’s choice, to be selected from the Liberal Arts and Creative Arts category  
• 
Science Elective: A course of the student’s choice, to be selected from the Maths, Physics & Chemistry list of 
courses 
• 
Fractal Segment: The part or duration of a semester in which a particular course is offered 
 
 
 
1.2. COURSE NUMBERING SCHEME  
Each course is denoted by a course number consisting of two alphabets followed by four numerals:

1.3. FRACTAL SEGMENTS  
In the fractal system, a semester is divided into six segments. Each segment is approximately 2.5 to 3 weeks in duration. 
Every fractal course is accompanied by a two-digit segment number indicating the duration of the course. The first 
number denotes the segment in which a course will begin and the second number the segment in which it will be 
completed. For example, Segment 34 means, a particular course will begin in segment-3 and finish at the end of segment-
4. Typically, a course running for full the semester (i.e., all six segments) would be 3-credits; so each segment will be 
equivalent to 0.5 credit. Accordingly, the credit of a course will be decided, based on its segment data. For example, if 
the segment of a course is 56, it implies that the course will be running in two segments (5 & 6). Hence, it will be 0.5 * 
2 = 1 credit.

Honors/Minors 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In addition to satisfying the minimum credit requirement for obtaining a degree, a student can also take 
up additional basket of courses either from the same or different department in the form of Honors & 
Minors. Such additional efforts would also be reflected in the final Degree certificate  
 
 
 

 
 
Fractal Academic Booklet 
45 
HONORS/MINORS 
 
• 
In order to earn a minor, a student has to earn a minimum of 12 extra credits from a basket of courses prescribed for 
each minor stream. 
 
• 
In order to earn honors, a student has to earn a minimum of 12 extra credits out of which six credits from project work 
and at least six credits are from courses offered by the student’s major department. 
 
• 
A student can enroll for both Minor & Honors or for two Minors. 
 
• 
The final transcript will only show the basic CGPA corresponding to the minimum requirement for the degree. The 
Minors/Honors will be indicated by a separate CGPA. The additional courses taken will also find separate mention in 
the transcript. If a student drops (or terminated) from the Minor/Honors program, they cannot convert the earned 
credits into free or core electives; they will remain extra. These additional courses will find mention in the transcript 
(but not in the degree certificate). In such cases, the student may choose between the actual grade or a “pass(P)” 
grade and also choose to omit the mention of the course as for the following: All the courses done under the dropped 
Minor/Honors will be shown in the transcript None of the courses done under the dropped Minor/Honors will be shown 
in the transcript. 
 
• 
Honors will be reflected in the degree certificate as “BTech (honors) in XYZ Engineering”. Similarly, Minor as “BTech in 
XYZ Engineering with Minor in ABC”. If a student has done both honors & minor, it will be acknowledged as “BTech 
(honours) in XYZ Engineering with Minor in ABC”. And two minors will be reflected as ““BTech in XYZ Engineering with 
Minor in ABC and Minor in DEF”.

Q. 
Department-wise maximum number of students (or a percentage of existing student strength) that 
can avail this option? 
A. 
To avoid overloading, Departments offering Minors can put an upper limit on the number of Minor students they 
wish to take. The students have to understand that since the number of seats available for each of the Minor will 
always be limited, one has to compete for a place; he/she thus cannot ignore the basic CGPA. 
A cap of 15% increase in the original batch strength of any department due to minor. 
 
 
Q. 
When can one apply, in which semester? 
A. 
A student can enrol for Minor in the fifth semester only. There is no CGPA criterion for enrolling into a Minor. A 
student can enrol for Honors in the fifth or sixth semester, depending on the policy of the department. The 
department can plan the Honors from the fifth or sixth semester. There is no CGPA criterion for enrolling into 
Honors at the institute level.

CSE Minor Program Curriculum: The following minor curriculum is applicable for students in non-CSE departments who 
started their B.Tech in the Aug 2015 semester or later. 
 
Requirements: Any 12 out of the 23 credits listed in the table below, starting from 4th semester of the student from other 
departments. The student should ensure that the appropriate pre-requisites are met. It is up to the student to choose the 
courses and manage his/her schedule along with the courses in his/her home department. 
 
CSE Secondary major (Double major) curriculum: The following curriculum for obtaining CS as the additional major 
is applicable for students in non-CSE departments who started their B.Tech in the Aug 2015 semester or later. 
 
Requirements: 24 credits in the CSE department which must include any 15 out of the 23 credits listed in the table below, 
starting from 4th semester of the student from other departments. The student should ensure that the appropriate pre-
requisites are met. It is up to the student to choose the courses and manage his/her schedule along with the courses in 
his/her home department. 
 
Remarks: 
• 
If any course in the basket is part of the student’s primary major curriculum, then that course cannot be used to satisfy 
the CSE minor/secondary major requirements. 
• 
The minor and secondary major students should enroll with the application process, which will be announced at an 
appropriate time before the 4th semester. The announcement will be through email, and it is the interested student's 
responsibility to apply before the announced deadline. Note that this application process is different from the registration 
on the AIMS portal. 
• 
The seats for the minor and secondary major in CSE are limited to 10% of the CSE BTech program intake. The CGPA 
from the first and second semesters of the students would be used as a tiebreaker if there are more applicants than 
the number of seats available.

CONSTRAINT SOLVING 
Credits: 1 
Semester: 
Segment:  
Pre-Req: see 
syllabus 
Many real world problems reduce to solving a set of constraints. From time table scheduling to 
inventory management and fault localization to efficient resource utilization, it all ultimately boils 
down to expressing these problems as a set of constraints. Not only it is at the heart of most of 
the problems in operation research but constraint solving has applications ranging from 
computational biology to program analysis. These applications use the constraint solvers mostly as 
a black box. However, one can gain tremendously from the study of constraint solvers and the 
techniques they employ so as to adapt them to the problem at hand. 
This course will attempt to study the underlying techniques employed by modern day constraint 
solvers. In particular, solving techniques behind SAT, MaxSAT, Pseudo-Boolean constraint solving 
will be studied. In addition, this course will also attempt to take a look at SMT (Satisfiability Modulo 
Theories) solving.

The objective of this course is to learn basic and advanced compiler optimization techniques, either 
traditional or modern in their scope, or scalar-variable based or loop-optimization based in their 
application or machine independent or dependent in their variety. The initial part of the course 
would be devoted to a collection of traditional compiler analyses and optimizations that are 
primarily based on control flow and data flow analyses. This will be followed by studying more 
high-level optimizations that are based on the static single assignment intermediate representation 
as well as low-level optimizations like register allocation and instruction scheduling and software 
pipelining. The later part of this course would be devoted to a model named polyhedral compilation 
where for-loops can be transformed to run efficiently on advanced architectures like multi-core or 
GPU using rational and integer linear programming techniques. Here, the focus would be on basics 
of the three phase process of dependence analysis, affine scheduling and code generation.

COGNITIVE RADIO 
Credits: 
Semester: 
Segment:  
This course provides an introduction to cognitive radios, a new type of radio that will be capable 
of cooperatively adapting transmission modes, channels, and protocols to make the best use of 
the available spectrum. Such radios will include wideband receivers and transmitters, with many 
of their functions implemented in software, rather than hardware, to enable greater flexibility. 
While the most commonly cited example of uses of such radios is sharing of under-used portions 
of the spectrum with licensed (primary) users, the basic technology also can lead to improved uses 
of the ISM bands. In addition, the cooperative and adaptive nature of the radios has large 
consequences for jamming/anti-jamming in military communications, representing both a threat 
to current systems and an opportunity for their evolution to more secure modes. The course 
provides a background in the technology that makes these radios possible as well as providing 
guidance on their benefits in multiple access systems.

ORIGIN OF ETHICS IN POLITICAL THEORY 
Credits: 1 
Semester: Jul 
Segment: 23 
First philosophical contemplations about abstract ethical notions like virtue, truth, valor, wisdom, 
love etc took place in ancient Greece in 6th century BC.  These philosophers have incorporated 
debates and analyses on these abstract notions in most of their discourses on metaphysics, politics, 
ontology, rhetoric and aesthetics etc. This course explains the students the importance of looking 
at how and why they originated and more importantly what were they like in their nucleus form. 
Greece philosophy matured into its fullness in a span of less than a century with the emergence 
Socratic field in 5th century.  This ancient Greece philosophy has created an epistemological base 
for all the later political theories despite their ideological moorings. In brief, this course introduces 
the students to a political universe which for the first time ( or at least according to recorded data) 
tried to grasp several notions related to what the current generation calls ‘ethics’, its importance 
to human kind and more importantly how we can apply ‘ethics’ to solve problems that arise in a 
society from time to time.     
Presocratic Period: Views of Milesians (Thales, Anaximander and Anaximenes) on the origin; 
Pythagoras theory of harmony, soul’s transmigration and reincarnation; Herclitus theory of “all is 
flux”; Eleatics (especially Zeno of Elea) counter to Herclitus: Empedocles and Anaxagoras on 
pluralism; Greek Atomism with special reference to Epicurus; Sophists’ relativism and extreme 
skepticism (with specific reference to Protagoras); Socratic Period (Athenian Period): Socrates 
passion for dialogue and critical reasoning; his debate on what is (and why something becomes) 
right and/or wrong/ truth and how to arrive it, virtue etc; his disagreement with Sophists; why the 
then Athens daunted of him/reasons for his capital punishment;

THE SOCIOLOGY OF DIGITAL MEDIA: A GLOBAL PERSPECTIVE 
Credits: 1 
Semester: Jul 
This course focuses on the sociology of new media technologies, with a specific aim to anchor 
them within select theoretical debates and in specific geographic contexts.  The course is intended 
to contribute to an understanding of impacts on individual and society through the use of new 
digital media tools [example the internet, Social media, mobile phone technologies and devices]. 
Many of the case studies, supporting theory, will center on people in cross-cultural, resource-poor 
and emerging market settings [for example, developing countries, the urban slum etc…].  
The course will selectively but succinctly and comprehensively understand digital media: 
As everyday social practice in multiple contexts: where is it found [social geographies], who uses 
it [ownership], its social learning [sharing and skill building].  
As means to achieving social goals: From downloading latest Bollywood movies, chatting on social 
network sites and virtual gaming. 
Theories that frame and analyze digital media behaviors Example, Facebook, Twitter, Gaming, 
Multi-media, Search etc. 
Case-studies from the global North and South highlighting contemporary trends and their 
interaction with traditional media 
As emerging economies globalize and urbanize rapidly, and users in the global south become 
‘prosumers’  or more critical consumers and creative contributors of digital content, we require a 
shift in approaching new media  users with a more open-ended and explorative perspective. 
Thereby, the motivating question for our course is what are the implications and impacts of new 
media as leisure (entertainment/pleasure/ play) artifacts and as professional tools for social 
mobility especially in the contexts of developing economies and emerging markets. This course will 
cover interesting social transformations happening in the domain of communication and 
information channels and, consequentially, the shift registering through social media behaviors and 
practices. 
This class has no pre-requisite requirements and open to students from any background.  
Students will be continuously evaluated with periodic quizzes/short tests and a course end test that 
will gauge student ability in engaging with and comprehending the course readings and class room 
discussions.

INTRODUCTION TO SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY 
Credits: 1 
Semester: Jan 
This course is an introduction to the field of social psychology, one of the important sub-fields of 
psychology. While psychology is generally concerned with understanding and explaining individual 
human behaviour, social psychology can be described as the scientific field concerned with the 
understanding of individual behaviour in social situations. It explores how human thought and 
behaviour is influenced by the actual or imagined presence of others. How and why do people 
behave differently in different contexts? Why are some people more helpful while others more 
aggressive? What distinguishes good leaders from non-leaders? Why do we believe claims made 
by advertising companies which are obviously unreasonable? What are some of the techniques 
used to persuade people to change their minds? Why do people have extreme prejudices and 
stereotypes and how can these be overcome? These are some of the important questions that 
concern the field of social psychology.

LITERATURE AND SCIENCE 
Credits: 1 
Semester: Jul 
Segment: 34 
This course explores the dialogue between literature and scientific disciplines over a period of about 
200 years.  The split between the arts and sciences is relatively recent in the history of human 
knowledge and creativity: many of the great artists of the Renaissance or the 17th century, for 
example, would also qualify as great scientists in the way we understand the word ‘science’ today.  
And both artists and scientists have, despite appearances to the contrary, a continuing history of 
speaking to and about each other—even if sometimes what they have to say might not be very 
flattering to the other party.  It is this history that we will explore and try to learn from.  We will 
look at classic science fiction like Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein and Philip K. Dick’s Do Androids 
Dream of Electric Sheep?; we will read the work of highly articulate scientists like Richard Feynman 
and James Watson; we will look at what poets make of quantum physics, biochemistry and—of 
course—fractals.  We will occasionally look at visual material including films and paintings. 
The course has an optional creative component: assignments and projects can be works of creative 
writing. This course involves close reading of literary texts, so those who take this course should 
be comfortable with reading English literature. 
Plagiarism warning: Copy-pasting from the internet or other sources in your assignments will lead 
to a failing grade.

MODERN TELUGU AND ENGLISH POETRY: A COMPARATIVE STUDY OF CULTURAL 
POLITICS 
Credits: 1 
Semester: Jan 
Segment: 23  
Poetry has been written from ancient times in order to fulfill several purposes like personal 
satisfaction, royal or divine aggrandizement, fascination, political articulation etc.  However, it 
keeps on changing its form and content with the changing times and history and Telugu poetry is 
no exception from it. It is a perfect prototype of modern poetry written from colonial and 
postcolonial background and it strongly reflects the trends of the cultural politics, which are due 
for any other postcolonial nation.  Therefore, this course requires at least two types of attention: 

 
 
128 
IIT Hyderabad 
One is thematic and the other is theoretical.  In other words, some of the major cultural studies 
theory will be applied in order to understand the thematic universal of postcolonial poetry. 
Unfortunately, the only question that has been contemplated in the vernacular about art is: ‘is art 
for the sake of art or not.’  Though this question carries its own ideological impinges it also greatly 
delimited theory on poetry from growing.  On the other hand western world especially ancient 
Greece has given serious thought into the subject of poetry.  For instance, Aristotle had given a 
rigorous thought to poetry and argued that it is basically a mimesis (imitation) and interestingly 
Plato hated poetry for the same reason.  After several thousands of years, now in postcolonial 
times, some of the nations from Caribbean perceive its poetry as essentially hybrid (close to 
mimesis).  Thus this course deals with several questions pertinent to comparative analysis.  These 
questions are broadly: Does India, a postcolonial nation produce hybrid poetry like Caribbean?  If 
not, why?  In other words, why Indian vernacular fail to produce poetry on certain cultural 
experiences like its other postcolonial sister like Caribbean? Why vernacular poetry fails to be 
enough imaginative?   Etc.

AN INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN-COMPUTER INTERACTION AND ITS INTERFACE WITH 
THE SOCIAL SCIENCES 
Credits: 1 
Semester:  
Quote: “A sushi restaurant puts sensors on its plates to assess, in real time, what’s being eaten so 
it can adjust its food offerings” [ Goodman, The Atomic Age of Data, 2015]” End Quote. 
This course is an introduction to the field of Human-Computer interaction research with a focus on 
‘human’ and how the HCI domain interfaces with the social sciences.  The course begins with a 
selection of seminal work that establish the HCI domain: interactive systems/techniques, design 
and user interfaces. We will then move on to topics including social and context aware computing, 
design research and evaluation methods. 
Radically different ways of interacting with computationally based systems are possible, ranging 
from the visual [surfaces, input devices] to the invisible [ sensor technologies, back end processors] 
and importantly social [ which means non-technological] affectations triggering diverse ways of 
interfacing with technology.  
This course will center on the processes and challenges of ideating, designing and evaluating 
technologies as products, their usability and immersion into the social contexts of users. We will 
study contextual design as a field that emerged in response to the challenges of designing for 
context and usability. Another important strand in this course will dwell on the sociological aspects 
of HCI and explore the ‘mediation’ of technology use by a range of contextual situations: socio-
cultural obligations, habits, values, infrastructure, material objects and not in the least family, 
kinship and human bonds. Some examples of the above are:  
Understanding social interactions with a webcam as an important new development in 
communication interfaces and its widespread adoption in the real world supporting family 
relationships, business work flows and social networking. Another example will be looking at 
technologies driven by data science, like mobile marketing analytics, and their consequences for 
society. 
This course has no pre-requisites and is open to students from any background. Students are 
expected to do all of the readings. Students will be evaluated with a quiz or a test and a 
presentation that will gauge student ability in engaging with and comprehending the course 
readings and class room discussions. The class test and the presentation will be based on the class 
lectures and readings assigned for the course

ETHICS AND MODERN POLITICAL THEORY 
Credits: 3 
Semester: Jul 
Segment: 16 
In this phase of human history the concept of ‘ethics’ delinked itself from religion/divine authority 
and became more pragmatic. Perceptions about ‘human nature’ changed and state is projected as 
merely a technical organ to aid the individual.  Thus the state is demystified and lost its glory which 
it enjoyed from pre-Socratic, through Hellenistic to medieval periods (Ethical discourse during 
medieval period is omitted in this course because of its overwhelmingly religious inclinations). 
Human became crux of every discourse and apart from him/her no institution would enjoy any 
status. This has paved way for the formulation of several discourses based on strict 
individualism.  This course would focus on:  what this shift from state/church-centric ethical 
theories to human-centric theories mean, what are the broad changes this shift brought, its shift 
from subjectivism to staunch objectivism (for instance, most of these theories supported and 
benefited from positivism unlike the earlier ones), limitaions in such shifts etc.  All this will be 
debated around their ethical implications.   
European Enlightenment’s conflict with religion and emphasis on reason; ethical theories of Rene 
Descartes; Baruch Spinoza, Jean-Jacques Rousseau (Theory of human nature), Geroge Edward 
Moore’s refutation of idealism and solipsism (how Moore’s views paved way for ethical relativism); 
Brief principles of Individualism, Marxism (excerpts from the writings of Karl Marx on human

Emotivism.

ETHICS IN POLITICAL THEORY 
Credits: 3 
Semester: Jul 
Segment: 16 
First philosophical contemplations about abstract ethical notions like virtue, truth, valor, wisdom, 
love etc took place in ancient Greece in 6th century BC.  This ancient Greece philosophy has created 
an epistemological base for all the later political theories despite their ideological moorings. The 
course covers theories from ancient Greece to 20th century: 
Presocratic Period, Socratic Period (Athenian Period), Hellenistic Period: Major differences between 
Hellenistic and Pre-Hellenistic political theories and changes in their political system from 
participatory government to highly centralized state; Epicureans; Stoics; Skeptics; Neo-Platonism 
by Plotinus; European Enlightenment’s conflict with religion and emphasis on reason; ethical 
theories of Rene Descartes; Baruch Spinoza, Jean-Jacques Rousseau (Theory of human nature), 
Geroge Edward Moore’s refutation of idealism and solipsism (how Moore’s views paved way for 
ethical relativism); Brief principles of Individualism, Marxism (excerpts from the writings of Karl 
Marx on human nature), Utilitarianism (Jermy Bentham theory of hedonism); Logical Positivism 
and Ethical Emotivism; Postmodernism and Post structuralism.  
Postmodernism was started as a challenge to everything that underlies modern epistemology.  It 
thus has raised complicated questions about all its basic assumptions ranging from human nature, 
truth, telos, norms and established ways of doing academics writing history and so on.  Crux of 
this philosophy is extreme relativism and this implies great challenge to most of the normative 
codes and expected behaviors in a given system.   This philosophical trend reflects in the current 
culture in multiple ways.  While postmodern philosophy has contributed to de-stigmatize several 
cultural/foundational connotations, it has also posed great threat to the very settled notions of 
‘morality’.  Hence, the present course would try to analyze these theories and assess their 
applicability to rapidly changing current cultural scenario.

PERSONALITY PSYCHOLOGY 
 Credits: 3 
Semester: Jan 
Segment: 16 
Personality Psychology addresses questions about how individuals develop characteristics that 
make them unique from each other, why they act and behave the way they do, historical issues 
and controversies that personality psychologists have encountered, techniques used in assessing 
personality, and how the study of personality psychology may be applied to everyday life. Some of 
the most popular personality theories will be introduced. Since the organization of personality is a 
complex  one, shaped  by  many  influences  such  as  genetics,  environment, and internal  
conflicts,  one  may recognize  that there is no one approach that would present an integrated 
picture of human personality. The aim of this course is to provide an overall perspective that 
includes a multitude of factors in understanding personality.  This would help in application of

Credits: 3 
Semester: Jan 
Segment: 16 
Pre-Req: Only PG 
This course is an advanced level course that deals with the interface of culture and psychology in 
everyday life, focusing in particular on the area of mental health. Traditionally, theory and research 
in clinical psychology focusses on mental health from an individual biomedical perspective. The aim

abstraction but have to be understood in relation to sociocultural contexts. Thus, even something 
as personal and private as the ‘self’ is located in a web of social reality. Readings will include 
contemporary research in transcultural psychiatry, cross-cultural psychology, and cultural 
psychology. The focus will be on understanding the cultural variations in manifestations of mental 
illness, with specific emphasis on South Asia in general and India in particular. Illustrations will be 
taken from studies of healing systems across cultures. Finally, students will learn about the skills 
in cultural sensitivity in practice.
