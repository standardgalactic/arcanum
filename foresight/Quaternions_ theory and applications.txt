PREFACE 
 
 
This book focuses on the theory and applications of quaternions. Chapter 
One collects some old problems on lattice orders and directed partial orders on 
complex numbers and quaternions, and summarizes recent development in 
answering those questions. Chapter Two discusses spin 1 particles with 
anomalous magnetic moments in the external uniform electric field. Chapter 
Three examines techniques of projective operators used to construct solutions 
for a spin 1 particle with anomalous magnetic moment in the external uniform 
magnetic field. Chapter Four analyzes the implementation of a cheap Micro 
AHRS (Attitude and Heading Reference System) using low-cost inertial 
sensors. Chapter Five reviews the basic concepts of quaternion and reduced 
biquaternions algebra. It introduces the 2D Hermite-Gaussian functions (2D-
HGF) as the eigenfunction of discrete quaternion Fourier transform (DQFT) 
and discrete reduced biquaternion Fourier transform (DRBQFT), and the 
eigenvalues of two dimensional Hermite-Gaussian functions for three types of 
DQFT and two types of DRBQFT. Chapter Six investigates a leader-follower 
formation control problem of quadrotors. Chapter Seven considers 
determinantal representations the Drazin and weighted Drazin inverses over 
the quaternion skew field. 
Chapter 1 collects some old problems on lattice orders and directed partial 
orders on complex numbers and quaternions, and summarizes recent 
development in answering those questions. Within the matrix 10-dimensional 
Duffin-Kemmer-Petiau formalism applied to the Shamaly-Capri field, Chapter 
2 studies the behavior of a vector particle with anomalous magnetic moment in 
the presence of an external uniform electric field. The separation of variables 
in the wave equation is performed by using projective operator techniques and 
the theory of DKP-algebras. The whole wave function is decomposed into the

, the two remaining ones being uniquely determined 
by it. Consequently, the problem reduces to three independent differential 
equations for three functions, which are of the type of one-dimensional Klein-
Fock-Gordon equation in the presence of a uniform electric field modified by 
the non-vanishing anomalous magnetic moment of the particle. The solutions 
are constructed in terms of confluent hypergeometric functions. For assigning 
physical sense for these solutions, one must impose special restrictions on a 
certain parameter related to the anomalous moment of the particle. The neutral 
spin 1 particle is considered as well. In this case, the main manifestation of the 
anomalous magnetic moment consists in the modification of the ordinary plane 
wave solution along the electric field direction. Again, one must impose 
special restrictions on a parameter related to the anomalous moment of the 
particle. 
Chapter 2 - Within the matrix 10-dimensional Duffin-Kemmer-Petiau 
formalism applied to the Shamaly-Capri field, Chapter 3 studies the behavior 
of a vector particle with anomalous magnetic moment in presence of an 
external uniform magnetic field. The separation of variables in the wave 
equation is performed by using projective operator techniques and the theory 
of DKP-algebras. The whole wave function is decomposed into the sum of 
three components $\Psi_0, \Psi_{+}, \Psi_{+}$. It is enough to solve the 
equation for the main component $\Phi_0$, the two remaining ones being 
uniquely determined by it. Consequently, the problem reduces to three 
independent differential equations for three functions, which are of the type of 
one-dimensional Klein--Fock--Gordon equation in the presence of a uniform 
electric field modified by the non-vanishing anomalous magnetic moment of 
the particle. The solutions are constructed in terms of confluent 
hypergeometric functions. For assigning physical sense for these solutions, 
one must impose special restrictions on a certain parameter related to the 
anomalous moment of the particle. The neutral spin 1 particle is considered as 
well. In this case, the main manifestation of the anomalous magnetic moment 
consists in the modification of the ordinary plane wave solution along the 
electric field direction. Again, one must impose special restrictions on a 
parameter related to the anomalous moment of the particle. 
Chapter 3 - The separation of variables in the wave equation is performed 
using projective operator techniques and the theory of DKP-algebras. The 
problem is reduced to a system of 2-nd order differential equations for three 
independent functions, which is solved in terms of confluent hypergeometric

functions. Three series of energy levels are found, of which two substantially 
differ from those for spin 1 particles without anomalous magnetic moment. 
For assigning to them physical sense for all the values of the main quantum 
number 
0,1,2, ...
n 
, one must impose special restrictions on a parameter 
related to the anomalous moment. Otherwise, only some part of the energy 
levels corresponds to bound states. The neutral spin 1 particle is considered as 
well. In this case no bound states exist in the system, and the main qualitative 
manifestation of the anomalous magnetic moment consists in the occurrence of 
a space scaling of the arguments of the wave functions, compared to a particle 
without such a moment. Traditionally, the automotive industry has been the 
largest employer of robots, but their control is inline and programmed to 
follow planning trajectories. As shown in Chapter 4, in this case, in the 
department motor’s test of Volkswagen Mexico a semi-autonomous robot is 
developed. To date, some critical technical problems must be solved in a 
number of areas, including in dynamics control. Generally, the attitude 
estimation and the measurement of the angular velocity are a requirements for 
the attitude control. As a result, the computational cost and the complexity of 
the control loop is relatively high. 
Chapter 4 deals with the implementation of a cheap Micro AHRS 
(Attitude and Heading Reference System) using low-cost inertial sensors. In 
Chapter 4, the technique proposed is designed with attitude estimation and the 
prediction movement via the kinematic of a 4GDL robot. With this approach, 
only the measurements of at least two non-collinear directional sensors are 
needed. Since the control laws are highly simple and a model-based observer 
for angular velocity reconstruction is not needed, the proposed new strategy is 
very suitable for embedded implementations. The global convergence of the 
estimation and prediction techniques is proved. Simulation with some 
robustness tests is performed. 
Chapter 5 - The quaternions, reduced biquaternions (RBs) and their 
respective Fourier transformations, i.e., discrete quaternion Fourier transform 
(DQFT) and discrete reduced biquaternion Fourier transform (DRBQFT), are 
very useful for multi-dimensional signal processing and analysis. In Chapter 5, 
the basic concepts of quaternion and RB algebra are reviewed, and the author 
introduce the two dimensional Hermite-Gaussian functions (2D-HGF) as the 
eigenfunction of DQFT/DRBQFT, and the eigenvalues of 2D-HGF for three 
types of DQFT and two types of DRBQFT. After that, the relation between 
2D-HGF and Gauss-Laguerre circular harmonic function (GLCHF) is given. 
From the aforementioned relation and some derivations, the GLCHF can be 
proved as the eigenfunction of DQFT/DRBQFT and its eigenvalues are

summarized. These GLCHFs can be used as the basis to perform color image 
expansion. The expansion coefficients can be used to reconstruct the original 
color image and as a rotation invariant feature. The GLCHFs can also be 
applied to color matching applications. 
Chapter 6 - The unit quaternion system was invented in 1843 by William 
Rowan Hamilton as an extension to the complex number to find an answer to 
the question (how to multiply triplets?). Yet, quaternions are extensively used 
to represent the attitude of a rigid body such as quadrotors, which is able to 
alleviate the singularity problem caused by the Euler angles representation. 
The singularity is in general a point at which a given mathematical object is 
not defined and it outcome of the so called gimbal lock. The singularity is 
occur when the pitch angles rotation is

. In Chapter 6, a leader-
follower formation control problem of quadrotors is investigated. The 
quadrotor dynamic model is represented by unit quaternion with the 
consideration of external disturbance. Three different control techniques are 
proposed for both the leader and the follower robots. First, a nonlinear H 
design approach is derived by solving a Hamilton-Jacobi inequality following 
from a result for general nonlinear affine systems. Second, integral 
backstepping (IBS) controllers are also addressed for the leader-follower 
formation control problem. Then, an iterative Linear Quadratic Regulator 
(iLQR) is derived to solve the problem of leader-follower formation. The 
simulation results from all types of controllers are compared and robustness 
performance of the H controllers, fast convergence and small tracking errors 
of iLQR controllers over the IBS controllers are demonstrated. 
Chapter 7 - A generalized inverse of a given quaternion matrix (similarly, 
as for complex matrices) exists for a larger class of matrices than the invertible 
matrices. It has some of the properties of the usual inverse, and agrees with the 
inverse when a given matrix happens to be invertible. There exist many 
different 
generalized 
inverses. 
The 
authors 
consider 
determinantal 
representations of the Drazin and weighted Drazin inverses over the 
quaternion skew field. Due to the theory of column-row determinants recently 
introduced by the author, the authors derive determinantal representations of 
the Drazin inverse for both Hermitian and arbitrary matrices over the 
quaternion skew field. Using obtained determinantal representations of the 
Drazin inverse we get explicit representation formulas (analogs of Cramer's 
rule) for the Drazin inverse solutions of the quaternionic matrix equations 
AXB = D and, consequently, AX = D, XB = D in both cases when A  and 
B  are Hermitian and arbitrary, where A , B  can be noninvertible matrices of

appropriate sizes. The author obtain determinantal representations of solutions 
of the differential quaternionic matrix equations, X' +AX = B and 
X' +XA = B , where A  is noninvertible as well. Also, the authors obtains 
new determinantal representations of the W-weighted Drazin inverse over the 
quaternion skew field. The author give determinantal representations of the W-
weighted Drazin inverse by using previously obtained determinantal 
representations of the Drazin inverse, the Moore-Penrose inverse, and the limit 
representations of the W-weighted Drazin inverse in some special case. Using 
these determinantal representations of the W-weighted Drazin inverse, the 
authors derive explicit formulas for determinantal representations of the W-
weighted Drazin inverse solutions of the quaternionic matrix equations

Introduction
We will introduce some deﬁnitions and terminologies in this section. The reader
is referred to [2, 3, 5] for more information on partially ordered rings and lattice-
ordered rings (ℓ-rings).
Let R be a partially ordered ring. The positive cone of R is deﬁned as
R+ = {r ∈R | r ≥0}. The positive cone R+ is closed under the addition

and multiplication of R and satisﬁes R+ ∩−R+ = {0}. Let P be a subset of
a ring S that is closed under the addition and multiplication of S and satisﬁes
P ∩−P = {0}. Deﬁne the partial order ≤by for any a, b ∈S, a ≤b if
b−a ∈P. Then S is a partially ordered ring with respect to the partial order ≤.
We often use the positive cone to denote a partial order on a partially ordered
ring. A partial order is called directed if each element is a difference of two
positive elements. A partially ordered ring is called a lattice-ordered ring (ℓ-
ring) if the partial order is a lattice order. Clearly a lattice order is directed,
but the converse is not true. Let T be a commutative totally ordered ring with
the identity and A be an algebra over T. If A is a partially ordered ring and
T +A+ ⊆A+, then A is called a partially ordered algebra over T. If the partial
order on A is directed, then A is called a directed algebra, and if the partial order
on A is a lattice order, then A is called a lattice-ordered algebra (ℓ-algebra).
Let D be a totally ordered integral domain, that is, D is a commutative
totally ordered ring with the identity and without nonzero zero divisors. For
x, y ∈D, x ≪y denotes that nx ≤y for all positive integers n. Let T be
a commutative totally ordered ring with the identity element 1. The complex
numbers over T is deﬁned as
CT = {a + bi | a, b ∈T, i2 = −1},
and the quaternions over T is deﬁned as
HT = {a0 + a1i + a2j + a3k | a0, a1, a2, a3 ∈T, i2 = j2 = k2 = −1}.
The multiplication of HT is given as follows,
(a0 + a1i + a2j + a3k)(b0 + b1i + b2j + b3k) =
(a0b0 −a1b1 −a2b2 −a3b3) + (a0b1 + a1b0 + a2b3 −a3b2)i +
(a0b2 + a2b0 + a3b1 −a1b3)j + (a0b3 + a3b0 + a1b2 −a2b1)k.
The following questions have been left unanswered for some time now, how-
ever they have greatly motivated research activities in the area.
• Problem 1. (G. Birkhoff and R. Pierce, 1956) Can the ﬁeld of complex
numbers be made into a lattice-ordered ring?
• Problem 2. (L. Fuchs, 1963) Describe the directed orders of the ﬁelds of
complex numbers and quaternions.

• Problem 3. (G. Birkhoff, 1967) In how many ways can the quaternions
be made into an ℓ-ring? an ℓ-algebra? a directed algebra?
We will summarize below recent developments in ﬁnding lattice orders and
directed partial orders on quaternion algebras. Since this activity is closely re-
lated to and motivated by the same research for complex numbers, results for
complex numbers are also included.

Directed Partial Orders on CF
In this section, we present directed partial orders on CF , where F is a totally or-
dered ﬁeld. We start with lattice orders ﬁrst. Lattice-ordered rings (ℓ-rings) were
ﬁrst systematically studied by G. Birkhoff and R. Pierce in the paper “Lattice-
ordered Rings” published in 1956 [2]. Problem 1 was asked in the paper. De-
spite many efforts made over years, this problem remains unsolved.
In the same paper, the authors proved that the complex ﬁeld C cannot be
made into a lattice-ordered algebra (ℓ-algebra) over the real ﬁeld R. About 40
years later, motivated by the work on lattice orders of matrix algebras over to-
tally ordered ﬁelds, the present author further proved that for any totally ordered
subﬁeld F of R with the usual total order, Mn(CF ) cannot be made into an ℓ-
algebra over F for any n ≥1 [6], where Mn(CF ) is the n × n matrix algebra
with entries from CF .
More generally, we have following result.
Theorem 1. [8, Theorem 6] Let D be a totally ordered integral domain. Sup-
pose that CD is an ℓ-algebra over D. If a + bi ≥0 in CD, then a ≥0 and
|b| ≪a in D.
A direct consequence of Theorem 1 is that if D is an archimedean totally
ordered integral domain, then CD cannot be an ℓ-algebra over D.
A natural question to ask is what happens in the non-archimedean case.
Theorem 2. [8, Theorem 4] Let F be a totally ordered ﬁeld, archimedean or
non-archimedean. CF cannot be made into an ℓ-algebra over F.
Now, let’s consider directed partial orders on the set of complex numbers to
make it into a directed algebra. Since it has been unsuccessful of ﬁnding lattice
orders on complex numbers, researchers have tried to ﬁnd directed partial orders
on it. The ﬁrst result states that there is no directed partial order on CF when F
is an archimedean totally ordered ﬁeld.

4
Jingjing Ma
Theorem 3. [10, Corollary 2.2] CF cannot be made into a directed algebra
over an archimedean totally ordered ﬁeld F.
In [14], Y. Yang showed that for some totally ordered ﬁeld Q, CQ admits
directed partial orders to make it into a directed algebra with 1 > 0, and hence
i is an element with negative square, that is, i2 = −1 < 0. Then in [13], N.
Schwartz and Y. Yang proved that C can be made into a directed algebra over R,
and in [12], W. Rump and Y. Yang constructed directed partial orders on K(i),
where K could be any non-archimedean totally ordered ﬁeld and i2 = −1.
Their method has used multiplicative segment that is a convex additive subgroup
of F containing identity element 1.
Motivated by the above work, in [9], L. Wu, Y. Zhang and the present author
have introduced a more general method to produce directed partial orders on
CF . Take an additive semigroup S ⊆F + with 0, 1 ∈S, and take x, y ∈F +
with 0 < x, y ≤1. Deﬁne the positive cone Px,y(S) as follows.
Px,y(S) = {a + bi ∈CH | a ∈F +, −xa ≤sb ≤ya in F for all s ∈S}.
Then (CF , Px,y) is a partially ordered algebra over F and it is a directed algebra
if there exists z ∈F + such that s ≤z for all s ∈S [9, Theorem 2.2].
For a non-archimedean totally ordered ﬁeld F, take S = Z+ and x = y = 1,
then P1,1(Z+) is a directed partial order on CF that makes CF into a directed
algebra over F. We also observe that P1,1(Z+) is the largest directed partial
order on CF over a non-archimedean totally ordered ﬁeld. Therefore P1,1(Z+)
is division closed in the sense that for any a, b ∈CF , if a, ab ∈P1,1(Z+), then
b ∈P1,1(Z+).
We notice that the partial orders deﬁned above have positive identity ele-
ment, that is, 1 ∈Px,y(S). This begs the question whether we can construct
directed partial orders on CF such that 1 is not positive?
Let S be an additive semigroup of F + containing 0, 1. Suppose that there
exists w ∈F + such that s ≤w for all s ∈S. Deﬁne
P(S)>
=
{a + bi | a > 0, b > 0 in F, sb ≤a, ∀s ∈S} ∪{0},
P(S)<
=
{a −bi | a > 0, b > 0 in F, sb ≤a, ∀s ∈S} ∪{0}.
Thus P(S)< is the conjugate of P(S)>.
Theorem 4. P(S)> and P(S)< are directed partial order on CF with 1 ̸> 0.

Directed Partial Orders on Quaternions - A Brief Summary
5
Proof. Let’s just consider P(S)>. We leave it to the reader to check that P(S)>
is a partial order on CF . Take w ∈F + such that s ≤w for all s ∈S. For any
a + bi ∈CF ,
1 = (1 + w + i) −(w + i) and (1 + w + i), (w + i) ∈P(S)>,
so 1 is not positive. We also have i = (w+2i)−(w+i), and (w+2i), (w+i) ∈
P(S)>. Thus P(S)> is a directed partial order.
The relation between P1,1(S) and P(S)> is given as follows.
P(S)> = {a + bi ∈P1,1 | b > 0} ∪{0},
and
P(S)> + F + = {a + bi ∈P1,1 | b ≥0}.
The research in this direction continues. As a mater of fact, all directed
partial orders with 1 > 0 on CF over a non-archidemean totally ordered ﬁeld F
have been described in [10] by using the similar positive cones as Px,y(S).
3.
Directed Partial Orders on HF
In this section, we present results on directed partial orders on HF . First we
consider lattice orders. In 1962, McHaffy showed that the division algebra of
real quaternions cannot be an ℓ-algebra over R [11]; and much later in 2004,
it was shown that Mn(HF ) cannot be an ℓ-algebra over a archimedean totally
ordered ﬁeld F, for any n × n matrix algebra with entries from HF [4]. In fact,
the following more general result is true.
Theorem 5. [8, Theorem 6] Suppose that D is a totally ordered integral do-
main and HD is a partially ordered algebra over D. If a + bi + cj + dk ≥0
in HD, then a ≥0 and |b| ≪a, |c| ≪a, |d| ≪a in D. In particular, If D is
archimedean, then HD cannot be an ℓ-algebra over D.
How about HF over a non-archimedean totally ordered ﬁeld F? It was
proved that for any totally ordered ﬁeld F, HF cannot be made into an ℓ-algebra
over F with 1 > 0 [8, Theorem 7]. Actually, now we can prove that HF cannot
be an ℓ-algebra over any totally ordered ﬁeld F.

Jingjing Ma
Theorem 6. For a totally ordered ﬁeld F, HF cannot be an ℓ-algebra over F.
Proof. Suppose that HF is an ℓ-algebra over F and we derive a contradiction.
Then we know that 1 ̸> 0. By [5, Corollary 1.3], HF is the ﬁnite direct sum of
convex totally ordered subspace of HF over F. Since HF cannot be a totally
ordered algebra over F, there are at least two direct summands.
Let’s assume ﬁrst that HF = T1 ⊕T2, where T1, T2 are totally ordered
subspaces over F. Suppose 1 = q1 + q2, where qi ∈Ti. Since 1 ̸< 0, one of
q1, q2 must be positive. We may assume that q2 > 0, and hence q1 < 0. Let
q1 = a0 + a1i + a2j + a3k. Then
q2
1 = 2a0q1 −(a2
0 + a2
1 + a2
2 + a2
3) > 0
⇒
2a0q1 −(a2

3)(q1 + q2) > 0
⇒
(2a0 −a2

3)q2 > 0

0 −a2
1 −a2
2 −a2
3)q1 > (a2
0 + a2
1 + a2
2 + a2
3)q2 > 0.
However, since −q1 ∧q2 = 0, we must have a2
0 +a2
1 +a2
2 +a2
3 = 0 [5, Theorem
1.13], so a0 = a1 = a2 = a3 = 0. Thus q1 = 0, a contradiction.
Next, we assume HF = T1 ⊕T2 ⊕T3, where T1, T2, T3 are convex totally
ordered subspaces over F. Then 1 = q1 +q2 +q3, where qi ∈Ti. Similarly one
of q1, q2, q3 must be positive. Let q3 > 0 and q1 = a0 + a1i + a2j + a3k. Then
q2

2a0q1 −(a2

Then since |q1| ∧q3 = |q2| ∧q3 = 0, we must have a2
0 + a2
1 + a2
2 + a2
3 = 0, so
a0 = a1 = a2 = a3 = 0 and q1 = 0, a contradiction again.
Similar argument may be made to the case that HF is a direct sum of four
convex totally ordered subspaces over F. This completes the proof.
Theorem 6 answers the second question in Problem 3.
Now we consider directed partial orders on HF , where F is a totally or-
dered ﬁeld. By Theorem 5, HF cannot be a directed algebra over F if F is an
archimedean totally ordered ﬁeld.

Directed Partial Orders on Quaternions - A Brief Summary

Motivated from the results obtained by W. Rump, N. Schwartz, and Y. Yang
for complex numbers, we were able to make the real quaternions H into a di-
rected algebra over R with a non-archemedean total order [6]. In fact, deﬁne the
positive cone P on H as follows.
P = {a0 + a1i + a2j + a3k ∈H | a0 ≥0, |a1| ≪a0, |a2| ≪a0, |a3| ≪a0}
Then P is a directed partial order on H that makes it into a directed algebra over
R with R ∩P = R+ [6, Theorem 1].
In [9], the authors proved a more general method to produce directed partial
orders on HF over a non-archimedean totally ordered ﬁeld F. Take an additive
semigroup S ⊆F + with 0, 1 ∈S, and take x ∈F with 0 < x ≤1. Deﬁne the
positive cone Px(S) as follows.
Px(S) = {a0 + a1i + a2j + a3k ∈HF | a0 ≥0, |a1| ≪S xa0, |a2| ≪S xa0, |a3| ≪S xa0},
where |a1| ≪S xa0 means −xa0 ≤sa1 ≤xa0 for all s ∈S. Similarly for
|a2| ≪S xa0 and |a3| ≪S xa0. Then Px is a partial order on HF to make it into
a partially ordered algebra over F, and if there exists an element z ∈F + such
that s ≤z for all s ∈S, then Px is a directed partial order and HF is a directed
algebra [9, Theorem 3.2].
For instance, for a non-archimedean totally ordered ﬁeld F, take S = Z+
and x = 1, then Px is the positive cone P introduced in the previous paragraph,
and P1(Z+) is the largest directed partial order on HF .
Directed partial orders on HF in which 1 ̸> 0 may be constructed similarly
to the positive cone P(S)> and P(S)< on CF . However, the last question in
Problem 3 remains unsolved.
The directed partial orders constructed for complex numbers and quater-
nions over non-archimedean totally ordered ﬁelds have been generalized to
complex numbers and quaternions over non-archimedean partially ordered
ﬁelds that contain a totally ordered subﬁeld [7, Theorems 1 and 2].

Abstract
Within the matrix 10-dimensional Dufﬁn-Kemmer-Petiau formalism
applied to the Shamaly-Capri ﬁeld, we study the behavior of a vector
particle with anomalous magnetic moment in the presence of an external
uniform electric ﬁeld. The separation of variables in the wave equation
is performed by using projective operator techniques and the theory of
DKP-algebras. The whole wave function is decomposed into the sum of
three components Ψ0, Ψ+, Ψ+. It is enough to solve the equation for the

main component Φ0, the two remaining ones being uniquely determined
by it. Consequently, the problem reduces to three independent differential
equations for three functions, which are of the type of one-dimensional
Klein–Fock–Gordon equation in the presence of a uniform electric ﬁeld
modiﬁed by the non-vanishing anomalous magnetic moment of the parti-
cle. The solutions are constructed in terms of conﬂuent hypergeometric
functions. For assigning physical sense for these solutions, one must im-
pose special restrictions on a certain parameter related to the anomalous
moment of the particle. The neutral spin 1 particle is considered as well.
In this case, the main manifestation of the anomalous magnetic moment
consists in the modiﬁcation of the ordinary plane wave solution along the
electric ﬁeld direction. Again, one must impose special restrictions on a
parameter related to the anomalous moment of the particle.

Intoduction
Commonly, we shall use only the simplest wave equations for fundamental par-
ticles of spin 0, 1/2, 1. Meanwhile, it is known that other more complicated
equations can be assigned to particles with such spins, which are based on
the application of extended sets of Lorentz group representations (see [1]-[16]).
Such generalized wave equations allow to describe more complicated objects,
which have – besides mass, spin, and electric charge – other electromagnetic
characteristics, like polarizability or anomalous magnetic moment. These addi-
tional characteristics manifest themselves explicitly in the presence of external
electromagnetic ﬁelds.
In particular, within this approach, Petras [3] proposed a 20-component the-
ory for spin 1/2 particle, which – after excluding 16 subsidiary components –
turns to be equivalent to the Dirac particle theory modiﬁed by the presence of
Pauli interaction term. In other words, this theory describes a spin 1/2 particle
with anomalous magnetic moment.
A similar equation was proposed by Shamaly–Capri [6, 7] for spin 1 par-
ticles (also see [16, 17]). In the following, we investigate and solve this wave
equation in the presence of the external uniform electric ﬁeld.
The wave equation for spin 1 particle with anomalous magnetic moment

Algebraic Transformation of the Wave Equation
Let us introduce the matrix Y = iJ[34] = i(β3β4 −β4β3) , which satisﬁes the
minimal polynomial equation Y 3 = Y ⇔Y (Y −1)(Y + 1) = 0, and allows
us to deﬁne the tree projective operators:
P0 = 1 −Y 2 ,
P+ = 1
2Y (Y + 1) ,
P−= 1
2Y (Y −1),
and solve the wave function in terms of the three components:
Ψ0 = P0Ψ,
Ψ+ = P+Ψ,
Ψ−= P−Ψ,
Ψ = Ψ0 + Ψ−+ Ψ+ .
Acting on (2) by the operator P0, and taking into account the algebraic identities
Y β1,2 = β1,2Y,
P0β1,2 = β1,2P0,
P0PJ[34] = −iP(1 −Y 2)Y ≡0 ,
we get
(β1∂1 + β2∂2 + M) Ψ0 + P0β3 ∂3Ψ + (∂4 −eEx3) P0β4Ψ = 0 .
(3)
Let us consider the operator P0β3 (we shall further use the computation
rules within the DKP-algebra):
P0β3 = (1 −Y 2)β3 = (1 + 2β3β3β4β4 −β3β3 −β4β4)β3 =

= 2β3β3(β3 −β3β4β4) −(β3 −β3β4β4) = β3 −β3β4β4 .
Considering the identities
β3(1 −P0) = β3Y 2 = β3[β3β3 + β4β4 −2β3β3β4β4] =
= β3 + β3β4β4 −2β3β4β4 = β3 −β3β4β4 ,
the previous can be written in the form
P0β3 = β3(1 −P0) = β3(P+ + P−) .
(4)
Similarly, one can obtain the identity
P0β4 = β4(1 −P0) = β4(P+ + P−) .
(5)
Taking into account the relations (4)–(5), (3) reduces to the form
(β1∂1 + β2∂2 + M) Ψ0 +
+ [β3 ∂3 + β4(∂4 −eEx3)] Ψ+ + [β3 ∂3 + β4(∂4 −eEx3)]Ψ−= 0 .

Let us consider the operator

2(Y + Y 2) =

2[i(β3β4 −β4β3) −2β3β3β4β4 + β3β3 + β4β4].
For β3
3 = β3 and β3β4β3 = 0, it follows
β3P+ = 1
2(β3 + iβ3β3β4 −β3β4β4) .
As well, for β3
4 = β4 and β4β3β4 = 0, we infer
β4P+ = β4
1
2[i(β3β4 −β4β3) −2β3β3β4β4 + β3β3 + β4β4] =
= 1
2[−iβ4β4β3 −2β4β3β3β4β4 + β4β3β3 + β4] .

16
E. M. Ovsiyuk, Ya. A. Voynova, V. V. Kisel et al.
Further, by using the identities
β4β4β3 = β3 −β3β4β4 ,
β4β3β3 = β4 −β3β3β4,
we get
β4P+ = 1
2[−i(β3 −β3β4β4) −2(β4 −β3β3β4)β4β4 + (β4 −β3β3β4) + β4] =
= −i
2[β3 −β3β4β4 + iβ3β3β4] .
Hence, we obtain the algebraic relation
β3P+ = iβ4P+
=⇒
(β3 −iβ4)P+ = 0 .
(7)
By combining the relations
iβ4P+ = 1
2[β3 −β3β4β4 + iβ3β3β4],
β3P+ = 1
2(β3 + iβ3β3β4 −β3β4β4) ,
we easily derive
β3P+ = 1
2(β3 + iβ4)P+ .
(8)
As well, by combining (7)–(8), we get
β4P+ = −i
2(β3 + iβ4)P+ .
In the same manner, we get the following three identities
(β3 + iβ4)P−= 0 ,
β3P−= 1
2(β3 −iβ4)P−,
β4P−= i
2(β3 −iβ4)P−.

+(β3 ∂3 + β4(∂4 −eEx3)]P+Ψ+ + (β3 ∂3 + β4(∂4 −eEx3)]P−Ψ−= 0 .
With the help of above identities, (9) can be rewritten in the form4

By using the easy-to-check identity
1 −P0 = Y 2 = β3β3 + β4β4 −2β3β3β4β4 ,
we get
(1 −P0)β3 = β3 + (β3 −β3β4β4) −2β3β3(β3 −β3β4β4) = +β3β4β4 .
Similarly, we derive
β3P0 = β3(1 −Y 2) = β3(1 −β3β3 −β4β4 + 2β3β3β4β4) = +β3β4β4 .
By combining the two last relations, we obtain the commutation rule
(1 −P0)β3 = β3P0 .
In the same manner, we derive the following three similar relations
β4 −β3β3β4 = (1 −P0)β4,
β4 −β3β3β4 = β4P0,
(1 −P0)β4 = β4P0 ,

We need three auxiliary relations. From the known formula

it follows
β3Y −Y β3 = +iβ4

Y β3 = β3Y −iβ4 ,

2Y (1 + Y ) = 1
2(Y 2 + Y 3 = P+ =⇒Y Ψ+ = Ψ+ .

Then the previous equation reads
„

Ψ+ + 1

„ ∂

«
Ψ0 = 0 .
As well, by acting on (11) by the operator 1
2(1 −Y ), after similar calculations
we get the equation
„

∂x1 + β2 ∂
∂x2 −iΓ0P + M

„ ∂

Ψ0 = 0 .

The Separation of Variables
We start with the three equations
(β1∂1 + β2∂2 + M)Ψ0+
+ 1
√
2β+[(∂3 + ieEx3) −i∂4]Ψ+ +
1
√
2β−[(∂3 −ieEx3) + i∂4]Ψ−= 0 ,
(β1∂1 + β2∂2 −iΓ0P + M)Ψ+ +
1
√
2β−[(∂3 −ieEx3) + i∂4]Ψ0 = 0 ,
(β1∂1 + β2∂2 + iΓ0P + M)Ψ−+
1
√
2β+[(∂3 + ieEx3) −i∂4]Ψ0 = 0 ,
where
β+ =
1
√
2
(β3 + iβ4),
β−= 1
√
2
(β3 −iβ4) .
We look for solutions of the form:
Ψ0 = eip4x4eip1x1eip2x2f0(x3) ,
Ψ+ = eip4x4eip1x1eip2x2f+(x3) ,
Ψ−= eip4x4eip1x1eip2x2f−(x3) .
So, we have the system of three equations in the variable x3:
(ip1β1 + ip2β2 + M)Ψ0+
+ 1
√
2β+[( d
dx3 + ieEx3) + p4]Ψ+ +
1
√
2β−[( d

(ip1β1 + ip2β2 −iΓ0P + M)Ψ+ +
1
√
2β−[( d
dx3 −ieEx3) −p4]Ψ0 = 0 ,
(ip1β1 + ip2β2 + iΓ0P + M)Ψ−+
1
√
2β+[( d
dx3 + ieEx3) + p4]Ψ0 = 0 .

iΓ0 = Γ,

the equations are written as

(13)
(iˆp −ΓP + M)Ψ+ −β−ˆbΨ0 = 0 ,
(14)
(iˆp + ΓP + M)Ψ−+ β+ˆaΨ0 = 0 .
(15)
By acting (14) by the operator
M −Γ ¯P
M −Γ ,
we infer
M −Γ ¯P
M −Γ iˆp + M −Γ ¯P
M −Γ (M −ΓP)

Ψ+ −M −Γ ¯P
M −Γ β−ˆbΨ0 = 0 .
With the help of the identities
M −Γ ¯P
M −Γ (M −ΓP) =
1
M −Γ(M2 −MΓP −MΓ ¯P ) = M ,
it reads
M −Γ ¯P
M −Γ iˆp + M

Ψ+ −M −Γ ¯P
M −Γ β−ˆbΨ0 = 0 .
By using the notations
M −Γ ¯P
M −Γ iˆp = A,
M −Γ ¯P
M −Γ β−= β′

the previous equation shortens to
(A + M)Ψ+ −β′
−ˆbΨ0 = 0 .
Analogously, by acting on (15) by the operator
M + Γ ¯P
M + Γ ,

we get
M + Γ ¯P
M + Γ iˆp + M + Γ ¯P
M −Γ (M + ΓP)

Ψ−+ M + Γ ¯P
M + Γ β+ˆaΨ0 = 0 .
Taking into account the identities
M + Γ ¯P
M + Γ (M + ΓP) =

M + Γ(M2 + MΓP + MΓ ¯P ) = M ;
we derive
M + Γ ¯P
M + Γ iˆp + M

Ψ−+ M + Γ ¯P
M + Γ β+ˆaΨ0 = 0 .
With the notations
M + Γ ¯P
M + Γ iˆp = C,
M + Γ ¯P
M + Γ β+ = β′

the last equation reads
(C + M)Ψ−+ β′

Let us consider the powers of A
A2 =

(M −Γ)2(iM ˆp −iΓ ¯P ˆp)(iM ˆp −iΓ ¯P ˆp) =
=
1
(M −Γ)2 [−M2ˆp 2 + MΓˆp ¯P ˆp + MΓ ¯P ˆp2 −Γ2 ¯P ˆp ¯P ˆp] .
Because
βµ = Pβµ + βµP = ¯Pβµ + βµ ¯P, βµP = Pβµ, ¯Pβµ = βµ ¯P,
PβµP = ¯Pβµ ¯P = 0, βµβνP = Pβµβν, βµβν ¯P = ¯P βµβν,
P + ¯P = 1, P ¯P = ¯P P = 0,
we get
A2 =
1
(M −Γ)2 (−M2ˆp2 + MΓˆp2) = −M ˆp2
M −Γ .

We calculate A3:
A3 = −
M
(M −Γ)2 (M −Γ ¯P )(iˆp)ˆp2 = −
Mp2
(M −Γ)
(M −Γ ¯P)
M −Γ
(iˆp) ,
so, the minimal polynomial of A (or the Cayley-Hamilton identity for A) has
the form
A3 + Mp2
M −ΓA = 0 .
Similar results are valid for the operator C:
C3 + Mp2
M + ΓC = 0 .
The Cayley-Hamilton identity for iˆp) has the form
iˆp [(iˆp)2 + p2] = 0 .
Thus, the complete set of equations in the variable x3 is of the form
(iˆp + M) f0 + β+ˆaf+ −β−ˆbf−= 0 ,
(A + M)f+ −β′
−ˆbf0 = 0 ,
(C + M)f−+ β′
+ˆaf0 = 0 .
To proceed with these equations, we introduce the matrices5 with the properties
(iˆp + M)(iˆp + M) = p2 + M2,
(A + M)(A + M) = p2 + M2,
(C + M)(C + M) = p2 + M2 .
(16)
In fact these formulas determine the inverse matrices up to numerical factors
(p2+M2)−1. Then the system of radial equations can be rewritten alternatively
(iˆp + M) (p2 + M2)f0 + β+ˆa(p2 + M2)f+ −β−ˆb(p2 + M2)f−= 0 ,
(p2 + M2)f+ −(A + M)β′
−ˆbf0 = 0 ,
(p2 + M2)f−+ (C + M)β′
+ˆaf0 = 0 .
(17)
5We take in the account that p2 = p2
1 + p2

The ﬁrst equation in (17), with the help of the other two ones, transforms
into an equation in the component f0(r):
(iˆp + M)(p2 + M 2)2f0 + β+ˆa(A + M)β′
−ˆbf0 + β−ˆb(C + M)β′
+ˆamf0 = 0 , (18)
while the two remaining ones do not change
(p2 + M 2)f+ −(A + M)β′
−ˆbf0 = 0 ,
(p2 + M 2)f−+ (C + M)β′
+ˆaf0 = 0 .
(19)
In fact, the equations (19) mean that it sufﬁces to solve (18) with respect to f0; the two
other components f+ and f−can be calculated by means of the equations (19).
To proceed further, we need to know the explicit form of the inverse operators (16).
To solve this task, we ﬁrst establish the minimal polynomials for the relevant matrices.
Therefore, the needed inverse operators must be quadratic with respect to the rele-
vant matrices. They are given by the formulas:
(M + iˆp) =
1
M
(iˆp)2 −M(iˆp) + (p2 + M 2) ,
(A + M) = p2+M 2

M
h
1 −
M+Γ
p2+M 2+MΓC +
M+Γ
M(p2+M 2+MΓ)C2i
.
Taking into account the explicit form of the inverse operators, we get
(p2 + M 2)f0+

From (22) we derive

By combining these equations as follows:
p1 · [EQ.I] + p2 · [EQ.II],

we derive

M2 {(p2 + M2)(p2f1 −p1f2) −p2(p2f1 −p1f2)} = 0 .
After elementary manipulations, they read

(24)

(25)
Let us write down here the remaining two equations (see (22)–(23)) as well:
(p2 + M2)f[12] −i

(27)
From (25)– 26), we easily derive
[(ˆaˆb + ˆbˆa) + (p2 + M2)](p2f1 −p1f2) = 0 ,
f[12] =

iM (p2f1 −p1f2) .
Thus, we need to investigate only the two remaining equations. We introduce
the shortening notation:
F = f[34],
G = p1f1 + p2f2 ,
and then the equations get the form

(29)
Let us transform the ﬁrst equation (28) to the form

which after elementary manipulation yields

Let us combine the equations [EQ.I] and [EQ.II] as follows:
−Γp2·[EQ.I]+(p2+M2)·[EQ.II],
(p2+M2−Γ2)·[EQ.I]+Γ··[EQ.II] = ...;
this leads to
[(ˆaˆb + ˆbˆa) + p2 + M2]G −Γp2F + p2
M (ˆaˆb −ˆbˆa)F = 0 ,
[(ˆaˆb +ˆbˆa) + p2 + M2]F + ΓG −1
M (ˆaˆb −ˆbˆa)G −Γ2F + Γ
M (ˆaˆb −ˆbˆa)F = 0 .

Let us introduce the notation ieE = E0; then the system is written as

G = p2F ,
 Γ −E0

F = −G + ΓF .
This sub-system is solved by diagonalizing the mixing matrix. To this aim, let
us introduce the new functions
Φ1 = G −λ1 F ,
Φ2 = G −λ2 F ,
where
λ1 = Γ +
p
Γ2 −4p2

λ2 = Γ −

So we get two independent equations:

For the second order operator, we have the explicit for, e.g., x3 = z:
(ˆaˆb + ˆbˆa) = −d2
dz2 −e2E2z2 −2eEϵz −ϵ2 .
Thus, we get the equation6:

Φ1,2(z) = 0 ,
where µ2 = p2 −M2 + λ′

This task coincides with that which arises for the scalar Klein–Fock–Gordon
particle in external uniform electric ﬁeld modiﬁed by an anomalous magnetic
moment.

Restrictions on the Values of Anomalous Magnetic

On physical grounds, the above parameter µ2 must be positive, for both cases

Γ0 −eE

Clearly, the region for Γ0, given by8:
Γ0 −eE
M > 0
(eE > 0),
has no physical sense, because it does not contain the vicinity of the point Γ0 =
0. So, in the following we assume that
Γ0 −y < 0,
y = eE
M > 0 .
Then, the main inequality takes the form
2(M2 + p2)
(y −Γ0)
> Γ0 ±

Γ2
0 + 4p2 .
Let us study the variant Γ0 < 0, (−) – lower sign :
2(M2 + p2)
(y −Γ0)
> Γ0 −
q
Γ2
0 + 4p2 ,
which is valid without any additional restrictions.
We ﬁrst address the variant Γ0 < 0, (+) – upper sign:
2(M2 + p2)
(y −Γ0)
> Γ0 +
q
Γ2
0 + 4p2 .
7In our considerations, Γ0 is real-valued
8For deﬁniteness, we assume that eE > 0

This yields
2(M2 + p2)
(y −Γ0)
−Γ0 > +
q
Γ2

which, after squaring, takes the form
4(M2 + p2)2
(y −Γ0)2
−2Γ0
2(M2 + p2)
(y −Γ0)
−4p2 > 0 ,
or
4(M2 + p2)2 −4Γ0(M2 + p2)(y −Γ0) −4p2(y −Γ0)2 > 0 .
It is convenient to use the variable x:
y −Γ0 = x > 0 ,
which leads to
(M2 + p2)2 −(y −x)x(M2 + p2) −p2x2 > 0 ,
equivalent to
x2 −2x(M2 + p2)y
2M2
+ (M2 + p2)2
M2
> 0 .
The roots of this quadratic equations are
x1,2 = (M2 + p2)
2M2
± (M2 + p2)y
2M2
p
y2 −4M2,
and the whole parabola lays above the horizontal axes only if the discriminant
is negative, and this yields
y2 −4M2 < 0
=⇒
eE
M < 2M .
Thus, we get the essential restriction on the magnitude of the electric ﬁeld Γ0 <
0.
We further address the variant Γ0 > 0, (−) – lower sign:
2(M2 + p2)
(y −Γ0)
> Γ0 −
q
Γ2
0 + 4p2 ;
which is evidently valid.

34
E. M. Ovsiyuk, Ya. A. Voynova, V. V. Kisel et al.
Let us now consider the variant Γ0 > 0, (+) – upper sign:
2(M2 + p2)

−Γ0 >
q
Γ2
0 + 4p2 .
After squaring this inequality, we obtain
4(M2 + p2)2 −4Γ0(M2 + p2)(y −Γ0) −4p2(y −Γ0)2 > 0 .
Now, we can repeat the previous analysis. With the help of the variable y−Γ0 =
x, we get
(M2 + p2)2 −(y −x)x(M2 + p2) −p2x2 > 0
or
x2 −2x(M2 + p2)y
2M2
+ (M2 + p2)2
M2
> 0 ;
the corresponding roots are
x1,2 = (M2 + p2)
2M2
± (M2 + p2)y
2M2
p
y2 −4M2.
The whole parabola lays above the horizontal axis only if the discriminant is
negative, which yields
y2 −4M2 < 0
=⇒
eE
M < 2M .
Considering the previous assumption 0 < Γ0, we derive 0 < Γ0 < eE
M .
All in all, we conclude that µ2 is positive, if the following double inequality
is valid
Γ0 < eE
M < 2M .
5.
Solving the Differential Equation
We start with the equation

Φ(z) = 0 ,
µ2 = M2 + p2 −λ′

We remark that this equation, after its transforming to a new variable x is – from
mathematical point of view – very similar to that arising for the non-relativistic
quantum harmonic oscillator:
x = ϵ + eEz
eE
,
 d2
dx2 −µ2 + (eE)2x2

Φ = 0 ,
 d2


f = 0 .
Let us use in (30) a new variable Z
Z = i(ϵ + eEz)2
eE
(let it be σ = µ2
4eE , eE > 0) .
Then we obtain an equation of the form
 d2
dZ2 + 1/2
Z
d
dZ −1
4 + iσ
Z

Φ(Z) = 0 ,
which has two singular points. The point Z = 0 is regular, and the behavior of
the solutions in its neighborhood may be as follows
Z →0,
Φ(Z) = ZA,
A ∈

.
The point Z = ∞is an irregular singularity of rank 2. Indeed, in terms of the
variable y = Z−1, the above equation reads
 d2

Φ = 0 .
When y →0, the corresponding asymptotic structure is given by
y →0,
Φ = yCeD/y,
Φ′ = CyC−1eD/y −DyC−2eD/y,
Φ′′ = C(C−1)yC−2eD/y−CDyC−3eD/y−D(C−2)yC−3eD/y+D2yC−4eD/y.
Then, the above equation gives

We retain only the main terms proportional to y−3 and y−4, and require that
their coefﬁcients vanish:

Thus, at inﬁnity, two asymptotics are possible

We shall further construct a solution in the whole region of Z. We start with
the substitution
Φ(Z) = ZA eBZ f(Z) .
This leads to

f(Z) = 0 .
We ﬁx A ∈{0 , 1/2} , B = −1/2 ; then the equation becomes simpler

f(Z) = 0 ,
which coincides with the conﬂuent hypergeometric equation with
a = A + 1/4 −iσ ,
c = 2A + 1/2 ,
f(Z) = ZA e−Z/2 F(a, c; Z).
Without loss of generality, we may take the value A = 0:
A = 0,
a = 1/4 −iσ ,
c = +1/2 ,
Φ(Z) = e−Z/2 f(Z) .
Let us consider two deﬁnite independent solutions of the conﬂuent hyper-
geometric equation10:
Y1(Z) = F(a, c; Z) = eZF(c −a, c; −Z)
Y2(Z) = Z1−cF(a −c + 1, 2 −c; Z) = Z1−ceZF(1 −a, 2 −c; −Z).
9We use the main branch of the logarithmic function.
10Note the equivalent representations for each solution.

These two lead to the corresponding Φ’s:
Φ1 = e−Z/2F(a, c; Z) = e+Z/2F(c −a, c; −Z) ;
Φ2 = e−Z/2Z1−cF(a −c + 1, 2 −c; Z) = Z1−ce+Z/2F(1 −a, 2 −c; −Z) .
By taking into account the identities
c = 1

a = 1
4−iσ,
c−a = 1
4+iσ = a∗,
c = c∗= 1
2,
Z∗= −Z ,
a −c + 1 = 3
4 −iσ = (1 −a)∗,
(2 −c) = (2 −c)∗= 3
2 ,
we conclude that the ﬁrst solution Φ1(Z) is given by a real-valued function,
whereas the second one, Φ2(Z), has the following property with respect to the
complex conjugation
Φ1(Z) = +[Φ1(Z)]∗,
Φ2(Z) = i[Φ2(Z)]∗.
This behavior of Φ2(Z) can be presented as the property of real-valuedness, if
one uses another normalizing factor

This results agrees with the previously obtained formula (31).
We can construct linearly independent solutions which do not behave at
inﬁnity as (quasi-)real superpositions of complex-valued functions. To this end,
we should employ another pair of linearly independent solutions
Y5(Z) = Ψ(a, c; Z),
Y7(Z) = eZΨ(c −a, c; −Z) .
The two pairs {Y5, Y7} and {Y1, Y2} relate to each other by the Kummer for-
mulas
Y5 =
Γ(1 −c)
Γ(a −c + 1) Y1 + Γ(c −1)
Γ(a)
Y2 ,
Y7 = Γ(1 −c)
Γ(1 −a) Y1 −Γ(c −1)
Γ(c −a) eiπc Y2 .
For large Z, (| Z |→∞), the following asymptotic formula is valid
Y5 = Ψ(a, c; Z) = Z−a = (iZ0)−1/4+iσ =
`
eln Z0+iπ/2´−1/4+iσ ,
Y7(Z) = eZΨ(c −a, c; −Z) = eZ(−iZ0)a−c = eiZ0(−iZ0)−1/4−iσ = eiZ0 `
eln Z0−iπ/2´−1/4−iσ .
These formulas – after passing to the functions Φ(Z) – take the form
Φ5 = e−Z/2Y5 = e−iZ0/2  eln Z0+iπ/2−1/4+iσ ,
Φ7 = e−Z/2Y7(Z) = e+iZ0/2  eln Z0−iπ/2−1/4−iσ .
We see that these functions are conjugate to each other; only these ones enter
the superpositions (33) and (34).
12We recall that
√
Z = e(1/2)(ln Z0+iπ/2).

Let us study this inequality. It is convenient to consider separately the following
four subcases:
1. upper sign (+), Γ0 > 0;
2. lower sign (−), Γ0 > 0;
3. upper sign (+) Γ0 < 0;
4. lower sign (−) Γ0 < 0.

evidently, this relationship is always valid.
Then, variant 3:

this relationship is always valid.

Conclusion
Within the matrix 10-dimensional Dufﬁn-Kemmer-Petiau formalism applied to
the Shamaly-Capri ﬁeld, we study the behavior of a vector particle with anoma-
lous magnetic moment in the presence of an external uniform electric ﬁeld. The
separation of variables in the wave equation is performed by using projective
operator techniques and the theory of DKP-algebras. The whole wave function
is decomposed into the sum of three components Ψ0, Ψ+, Ψ+. It is enough to
solve the equation for the main component Φ0, the two remaining ones being
uniquely determined by it. Consequently, the problem reduces to three inde-
pendent differential equations for three functions, which are of the type of one-
dimensional Klein–Fock–Gordon equation in the presence of a uniform electric
ﬁeld modiﬁed by the non-vanishing anomalous magnetic moment of the parti-
cle. The solutions are constructed in terms of conﬂuent hypergeometric func-
tions. For assigning physical sense for these solutions, one must impose special
restrictions on a certain parameter related to the anomalous moment of the par-
ticle. The neutral spin 1 particle is considered as well. In this case, the main
manifestation of the anomalous magnetic moment consists in the modiﬁcation
of the ordinary plane wave solution along the electric ﬁeld direction. Again,
one must impose special restrictions on a parameter related to the anomalous
moment of the particle.

particle with anomalous magnetic moment in presence of an external uni-
form magnetic ﬁeld.
The separation of variables in the wave equation is performed us-
ing projective operator techniques and the theory of DKP-algebras. The
problem is reduced to a system of 2-nd order differential equations for
three independent functions, which is solved in terms of conﬂuent hyper-
geometric functions. Three series of energy levels are found, of which
two substantially differ from those for spin 1 particles without anomalous
magnetic moment. For assigning to them physical sense for all the values
of the main quantum number n = 0, 1, 2, ..., one must impose special
restrictions on a parameter related to the anomalous moment. Otherwise,
only some part of the energy levels corresponds to bound states. The
neutral spin 1 particle is considered as well. In this case no bound states
exist in the system, and the main qualitative manifestation of the anoma-
lous magnetic moment consists in the occurrence of a space scaling of the
arguments of the wave functions, compared to a particle without such a
moment.

Introduction
Commonly, we shall use only the simplest wave equations for fundamental par-
ticles of spin 0, 1/2, 1. Meanwhile, it is known that other more complicated
equations can be proposed for particles with such spins, which are based on
the application of extended sets of Lorentz group representations (see [1]-[16]).
Such generalized wave equations allow to describe more complicated objects,
which have besides mass, spin, and electric charge, other electromagnetic char-
acteristics, like polarizability or anomalous magnetic moment. These additional
characteristics manifest themselves explicitly in presence of external electro-
magnetic ﬁelds.
In particular, within this approach Petras [3] proposed a 20-component the-
ory for spin 1/2 particle, which-after excluding 16 subsidiarycomponents - turns
to be equivalent to the Dirac particle theory modiﬁed by presence of the Pauli
interaction term. In other words, this theory describes a spin 1/2 particle with
anomalous magnetic moment.

Techniques of Projective Operators Used to Construct Solutions ...
49
A similar equation was proposed by Shamaly–Capri [6, 7] for spin 1 par-
ticles (also see [16, 17]). In the following, we investigate and solve this wave
equation in presence of the external uniform magnetic ﬁeld. The generalized
formulas for Landau energy levels are derived, and the corresponding wave
functions are constructed. The new formulas for energies in presence of ex-
ternal magnetic ﬁeld, in principle, allow to experimentally distinguish such a
particle. The restriction to the case of neutral vector boson (the uncharged spin
1/2 particle with anomalous magnetic moment) is performed in Sec. 2 – Sec. 6.
In Section 7 we give some details of the general theory of the Shamaly–
Capri particle; in particular, we describe some features of this theory extended
to General Relativity.

The Separation of Variables
The wave equation for spin 1 particle with anomalous magnetic moment [6, 7]
may be formulated in the form

βµDµ + ie
M λ3λ∗
3F[µν]PJ[µν] + M

Ψ = 0 ,
(1)
where the 10-dimensional wave function and the DKP-matrices are used:
Ψ =

Ψµ
Ψ[µν]
 ,
J[µν] = βµβν −βνβµ ,
where P stands for a projective operator separating from Ψ its vector component
Ψµ; Dµ = ∂µ −ieAµ; λ3 denotes an arbitrary complex number (see notation in
Sec. 7). In tensor form, (1) is1:
DµΨν −DνΨµ + MΨ[µν] = 0 ,
DνΨ[µν] ± 2 ie
M λ3λ∗
3F[µν]Ψν + MΨµ = 0 .
By using DKP-matrices, we apply the method of generalized Kronecker’s sym-
bols [20] 2:
βµ = eν,[νµ] + e[νµ],ν,
P = eν,ν ,
(eA,B)CD = δACδBD ,

δ[µν],[ρσ] = 1
2(δµρδνσ −δµσδνρ) ,
1In Minkowski space, the metric with imaginary unit is used, since x4 = ict.
2The indexes A(B, C, D, ...) take the values 1, 2, 3, 4, [23], [31], [12], [14], [24], [34].

by the term

Let us introduce the matrix Y = iJ[12] = i(β1β2 −β2β1); it satisﬁes the
minimal polynomial equation Y (Y −1)(Y + 1) = 0, which permits to deﬁne
tree projective operators:
P0 +P−+P+ = I,
P0 = 1−Y 2,
P+ = 1
2Y (Y +1),
P−= 1
2Y (Y −1)
and resolve the wave function into three components:
Ψ0 = P0Ψ,
Ψ+ = P+Ψ,
Ψ−= P−Ψ ,
Ψ = Ψ−+ Ψ0 + Ψ+ .

By making use of the projective operators

and the commutation relations for DKP-matrices, we prove the identities
β−P+ = β+P−= 0; so the above equation is written simpler

Let us act now on (6) by 1

1
2(1+Y )P+ = P+,
1
2(1+Y )P−= 0,
Y β−= β−P0,

the above equation simpliﬁes to

Similarly, by multiplying (6) by 1

2(1−Y )P−= P−,

2(1 + Y 2) = P+,
Y P−= 1

To separate the variables, we search for three components of the wave func-

Ψ± = eip4x4eip3x3ei(m±1)φf+(r) .

ˆbm =

(−d

ip3β3 + ip4β4 = iˆp ,
the equations (10) are written shorter
(iˆp + M) f0 + β+ˆam+1f+ −β−ˆbm−1f−= 0 ,
(11)
(iˆp + ΓP + M) f+ −β−ˆbmf0 = 0 ,
(12)
(iˆp −ΓP + M) f−+ β+ˆamf0 = 0 .
We further act on (11) by the operator
1
M + Γ(M + Γ ¯P ),
where
¯P = 1 −P .
This yields

1
M + Γ(M + Γ ¯P )iˆp +

M + Γ(M + Γ ¯P )(M + ΓP)

f+−

1
M + Γ(M + Γ ¯P )β−ˆbmf0 = 0 .
We note the relation
(M + Γ ¯P )(M + ΓP)
M + Γ
= M2 + MΓP + MΓ ¯P + Γ2 ¯PP
M + Γ
= M2 + MΓ
M + Γ
= M ,
which is valid due to the identities P + ¯P = 1, P ¯P = ¯P P = 0 . We introduce
the notations:
M + Γ ¯P
M + Γ iˆp = A ,
M + Γ ¯P
M + Γ β−= β′
−.

56
V. V. Kisel, Ya. A. Voynova, E. M. Ovsiyuk et al.
Then the above equation transforms to
(A + M)f+ −β′
−ˆbmf0 = 0 .
Similarly, we act on (12) by the operator
1
M −Γ(M −Γ ¯P ),
¯P = 1 −P ,
which yields

M −Γ(M −Γ ¯P )β+ˆamf0 = 0 .
Considering the identities
(M −Γ ¯P )(M −ΓP)
M −Γ
= M2 −MΓP −MΓ ¯P + Γ2 ¯PP
M −Γ
= M2 −MΓ
M −Γ
= M
and the notations
(M −Γ ¯P )
M −Γ
iˆp = C ,
M −Γ ¯P
M −Γ β+ = β′
+ ,
the above equation becomes
(C + M)f−+ β′
+ˆamf0 = 0 .
Thus, the radial system can be written as
(iˆp + M) f0 + β+ˆam+1f+ −β−ˆbm−1f−= 0 ,
(A + M)f+ −β′
−ˆbmf0 = 0 ,
(C + M)f−+ β′
+ˆamf0 = 0 .
To proceed with these equations, we introduce the matrices3 with the prop-
erties
(iˆp + M)(iˆp + M) = p2 + M2,
(A + M)(A + M) = p2 + M2,
(C + M)(C + M) = p2 + M2 .
(13)
3We take in the account that p2 = p2

In fact these formulas determine the inverse matrices to within numerical factors
(p2+M2)−1. Then the system of radial equations can be rewritten alternatively
(iˆp + M)(p2 + M2)f0 + β+ˆam+1(p2 + M2)f+ −β−ˆbm−1(p2 + M2)f−= 0 ,
(p2 + M2)f+ −(A + M)β′
−ˆbmf0 = 0 ,
(p2 + M2)f−+ (C + M)β′
+ˆamf0 = 0 .
(14)
The ﬁrst equation in (14), with the help of the other two ones, transforms into
an equation on the component f0(r):
(iˆp + M)(p2 + M2)f0 +
+β+ˆam+1(A + M)β′
−ˆbmf0 + β−ˆbm−1(C + M)β′
+ˆamf0 = 0 ;
(15)
while the two remaining ones do not change
(p2 + M2)f+ −(A + M)β′
−ˆbmf0 = 0 ,
(p2 + M2)f−+ (C + M)β′
+ˆamf0 = 0 .
(16)
In fact, the equations (16) mean that it sufﬁces to solve (15) with respect to f0;
the two other components f+ and f−can be calculated by means of equations
(16).
To proceed further, we need to know the explicit form of the inverse opera-
tors (13). To solve this task, we ﬁrst establish the minimal polynomials for the
relevant matrices. The minimal polynomial for (iˆp) is [3]
iˆp [(iˆp)2 + p2] = 0 .
(17)
We further consider the operator A2:
A2 =
1
(M + Γ)2(iM ˆp + iΓ ¯P ˆp)(iM ˆp + iΓ ¯P ˆp) =
=
1
(M + Γ)2 [−M2ˆp 2 −MΓˆp ¯P ˆp −MΓ ¯P ˆp2 −Γ2 ¯P ˆp ¯P ˆp] .
Due to the identities
βµ = Pβµ + βµP = ¯Pβµ + βµ ¯P, βµP = Pβµ, ¯Pβµ = βµ ¯P,

58
V. V. Kisel, Ya. A. Voynova, E. M. Ovsiyuk et al.
PβµP = ¯Pβµ ¯P = 0, βµβνP = Pβµβν, βµβν ¯P = ¯P βµβν,
P + ¯P = 1, P ¯P = ¯P P = 0,
we ﬁnd
A2 =
1
(M + Γ)2 (−M2ˆp2 −MΓˆp2) = −M ˆp2
M + Γ .
Thus, we get the minimal polynomial for A
A3 = −
M
(M + Γ)2 (M+Γ ¯P )(iˆp)ˆp2=−
Mp2
(M + Γ)
(M + Γ ¯P)
M + Γ
(iˆp)=−Mp2
M + ΓA .
Similarly, we ﬁnd
C3 = −M ˆp2
M −ΓC .
Therefore, the needed inverse operators must be quadratic with respect to
the relevant matrices. They are given by the formulas:
(M + iˆp) =
1
M

(iˆp)2 −M(iˆp) + (p2 + M2)

Thus, the ﬁnal form of the equations for the four functions f3, f4, f12, f34
has the following relatively simple structure:

The analysis of (22) and (23) can be now clearly done. The second sub-
system (24)–(25) is solved through diagonalizing the mixing matrix.
To this aim, let us introduce the new functions
Φ1 = (p3f3 + p4f4) + λ1f12 ,
Φ2 = (p3f3 + p4f4) + λ2f12 ,
(26)
where λ1, λ2 stand for the roots of the equation λ2 −λΓ + p2 = 0:

Φ1,2 = 0 ,
where λ′

(27)
To have both E1 and E2 real-valued and positive (such that these refer to phys-
ical energy levels), we require
z2 −x2Γ2 > 0,
z + x2 > 0,
(z + x2)2 −(z2 −x2Γ2) > 0 .
We consider the ﬁrst inequality
z2−x2Γ2 = (z−xΓ)(z+xΓ) > 0

this holds true if we impose the following restriction4:

⇐⇒


Γ < 0
⇐⇒
−2|B0|
M
< Γ < 0 .
(28)
The second inequality
z + x2 = (2N + 2M2) + xΓ + x2 > 0;
is valid due to (28). The third inequality 2zx2 + x4 + x2Γ2 > 0 is valid due to
z = 2N + 2M2 + xΓ, xΓ > 0.
4We remind that B0 = −|B0| < 0.

Thus, we get one simple restriction on the parameter Γ:
B0 = −|B0|,
−2|B0|
M
< Γ < 0 ,
(29)
which ensures that both spectra are physical (real and positive) for all the values
of quantum numbers. In the case under consideration, B0 = −|B0| < 0, from
(4) it follows
Γ = ±4−|B0|

therefore we have the only case when the upper sign is related to Γ < 0.

In order to have energy values positive and real-valued, we must impose the
following restrictions
z + x2 > 0,
z2 −x2Γ2 > 0,
(z + x2)2 −(z2 −x2Γ2) > 0 .
From the inequality
z2−x2Γ2 = (z−xΓ)(z+xΓ) > 0
=⇒
(2N+2M2)(2N+2M2+2xΓ) > 0
we get the main restriction5:
xΓ > 0
⇐⇒
(−2|B0|

⇐⇒
Γ < 0 .

We note that the possibility of positive values Γ > 0, Γ > 2|B0|/M is ignored,
because in this case the admissible region for Γ does not contain the close to
zero values. The two remaining inequalities are valid as well:
z + x2 = (2N + 2M2) + xΓ + x2 > 0;
2zx2 + x4 + x2Γ2 > 0
(z = 2N + 2M2 + xΓ, xΓ > 0) .

Conclusion to Sections 2–4
Let us summarize the main results of the Sections 2–4. Three series of the
energy levels are found; two of them substantially differ from those for spin 1
particles without anomalous magnetic moment.
The formula (27) and its restriction (29) provide us with two series for en-
ergy levels6 in both cases B0 = −|B0|, and B0 = +|B0|:
E1 = z+x2
2
+ 1

p
(z + x2)2 −(z2 −x2Γ2),
E2 = z+x2
2
−1
2
p
(z + x2)2 −(z2 −x2Γ2).
To assign to the energies E1 and E2 a physical sense for all the values of the
main quantum number n = 0, 1, 2, ..., one must impose special restrictions –
which are explicitly formulated – on the values of the anomalous magnetic mo-
ment. Without these restrictions, only some part of the energy levels correspond
to bound states.
The third series of the energy levels (see (23)) has the form:
B0 = −|B0| :
E3 = ϵ2 −M2 −p2
3 = 2|B0|( m + |m| + 1 + 2n) ,
B0 = +|B0| :
E3 = ϵ2 −M2 −p2
3 = 2|B0|(−m + |m| + 1 + 2n) ;
in these states the anomalous magnetic moment does not manifest itself at all.
6We remember the formal change m =⇒−m, when inverting the orientation of the magnetic
ﬁeld

Neutral Spin 1 Particles with Anomalous Magnetic
Moment
The case of a neutral vector boson exhibits a particular interest; now the radial
system for f3, f4, f12, f34 becomes simpler:
f34 = −i
M (p4f3 −p3f4) ,
(30)
h

(p4f3 −p3f4) = 0 ,

f12 = Γ2f12 + Γ(p3f3 + p4f4) .
(33)
Solving (30) and (31) is a trivial task. The system (31)–(33) can be solved
trough the diagonalization of the mixing matrix. Let us introduce the notation
∆= 1

ˆam+1ˆbm + ˆbm−1ˆam + p2 + M2i

Thus, for the functions Φ1 and Φ2, we get the separated equations

the above equation simpliﬁes to

parameter D be positive, in order to agree with the correspondence principle:

Without loss of generality, assume that B = +i

Thus, for a neutral particle, no bound states exist, and the qualitative manifes-
tation of the anomalous magnetic moment is mainly revealed by appearing of
space scaling of the arguments of the wave functions, in comparison with the
case of particles without the magnetic moment. Formally, we have two sorts of

Shamaly–Capri Theory and General Relativity
First, let us show that in Minkowski space, the Shamaly–Capri 20-component
model for the spin 1 particle in absence of external electromagnetic ﬁeld is re-
duced to ordinary DKP 10-component theory. We start with a free particle wave
equation
( i Γa∂a −m) Ψ(x) = 0 ,
(34)
where the 20-component wave function includes the tensors Φ, Φa, Φ[ab], Φ(ab),
and transforms by the following representation of the Lorentz group SO(3, 1)
T = (0, 0) ⊕(1/2, 1/2) ⊕(0, 1) ⊕(1, 0) ⊕(1, 1)
and Γa are 20 × 20-matrices

(∗) stands for complex conjugation, (gab) = diag(+1, −1, −1, −1). In (35)
numerical parameters λi are arbitrary obeying to the following set of restrictions
(see [18]):
λ1λ∗
1 −3
2λ3λ∗
3 = 0 , λ2λ∗
2 −λ3λ∗
3 = 1 .
(36)
We determine the explicit form of the matrices Γa by using basic elements of
the relevant matrix algebra eA,B:
(e A,B) D
C = δ A
C gB,D, eA,BeC,D = gB,C eA,D ,
A, B, ... = 0, a, [ab], (ab) ,
where δB
A is the generalized Kronecker symbol. The symbols with upper in-
dexes gA,B are derived from δ A
B with the help of the Minkowski metric tensor.
We use the following Kronecker symbols:
δ [ab]
[cd] = δa
c δb
d −δa
d δb
c , g[ab],[cd] = gac gbd −gad gbc ;
δ (ab)
(cd) = δa
c δb
d + δa
d δb
c −1
2 gab gcd ,
g(ab),(cd) = gac gbd+gad gbc−1
2gab gcd ;
and also the generators Jab for the Lorentz group representation
Jab = (ea,b −eb,a) + gkn(e[ak],[bn] −e[bk],[an]) + gkn(e(ak),(bn) −e(bk),(an)) .
Let us transform now (34) to its tensor form with respect to Φ, Φa, Φ[ab], Φ(ab):
λ1 ∂aΦa = m Φ ,
−λ∗
1 ∂bΦ + λ2 ∂aΦ[ba] −λ3 ∂aΦ(ba) = m Φb ,
λ∗
2 ( ∂bΦa −∂aΦb ) = m Φ[ba] ,
−λ∗
3 ( ∂bΦa + ∂aΦb −1
2 gab ∂cΦc ) = m Φ(ab) .
(37)
From the ﬁrst and fourth equations in (37), by considering the relations (36), we
obtain
−λ∗
1 ∂bΦ −λ3 ∂aΦ(ba) = 1
mλ3λ∗
3 ∂a(∂aΦb −∂bΦa)
or
−λ∗

3
λ∗
2
∂aΦ[ab] .

76
V. V. Kisel, Ya. A. Voynova, E. M. Ovsiyuk et al.
Then (see (37) and (36)) we get
1
λ∗
2
∂aΦ[ba] = m Φb .
Deﬁning now
Ψa = λ∗
2Φa ,
Ψ[ab] = Φ[ab] ,
(38)
we obtain the ordinary Proca tensor equations
∂bΨ[ab] = mΨa ,
∂aΨb −∂bΨa = mΨ[ab] .
(39)
The last equation can be represented in DKP matrix form
( i βa∂a −m)Ψ = 0 ,
Ψ =

Ψa
Ψ[ab]
 , βa = −igbc(ec,[ba] −e[ba],c) .
(40)
So, the equations (34) and (40) are equivalent from physical standpoint, because
their solutions must be unambiguously mutually related.
The generalization of (34) to the case of arbitrary curved space-time with
the metric gαβ(x) and any relevant eµ
(a)(x), may be performed in accordance
with the tetrad method of Tetrode–Weyl–Fock–Ivanenko [19]. Such an equation
has the form
[ iΓµ(∂µ + Bµ) −m ] Ψ = 0 ,
(41)
or
( iΓa∂(a) + i
2ΓaJcdγcda −m ) Ψ = 0 .
(42)
We use the notation
Γµ = Γaeµ
(a) , Bµ = 1
2Jabeν
(a)∇µe(b)ν ,
∂(a) = eµ
(a)∂µ , γabc = −(∇βe(a)α)eα
(b)eβ
(c) ;
here ∇µ represents the covariant derivative, while γabc stand for the Ricci rota-
tion coefﬁcients.
Let us show that any two equations of the type (41)
[ iΓµ(∂µ + Bµ) −m ] Ψ = 0 , [ iΓ
′µ(∂µ + B′

The ﬁrst one can be rewritten as

(a)S−1 = Γbe

which is a known relation, which ensures the Lorentz invariance of the wave

SBαS−1 = 1
2SJabS−1e β

we express the tetrad e(a)α in terms of primed tetrad. This leads to

Then we obtain
SBαS−1 = 1

V. V. Kisel, Ya. A. Voynova, E. M. Ovsiyuk et al.
But the last relationshipcan by proved by using the known pseudo-orthogonality
condition for Lorentz transformations and the explicit form of S and Jab. Thus,
(43) are mutually related to each other by a local transformation of the type (44).
The general covariant matrix wave equation (42) may be translated to the

Let us eliminate the components, and obtain the equation for the main compo-
nents Φa and Φ[cd]. To this end, from the ﬁrst and the fourth equation in (46) we
express Φ and Φ(ad) and substitute the results into the second one. Due to the
conditions (36) and the third equation in (46), we get

It remains to translate the equations (46) and (47) to the variables Ψa and Ψab
according to (38). In the end, we derive the tetrad generalized Proca system:

(49)
In (48), the term proportional to 2λ3λ∗
3

determines an additional interaction term
for a a generalized vector particle with the gravitational ﬁeld.
If we take into account the tetrad form of the Riemann and Ricci tensors
through the Ricci rotation coefﬁcients (48) can be written as:
Rabcd = −γabc,(d) + γabd,(c) + γakcγk

It can be readily proved that the tetrad system (46) can be translated to the
generally covariant tensor form7:
λ1 DαΦα = m Φ ,
−λ∗
1 DβΦ + λ2 DαΦ[βα] −λ3 DαΦ(αβ) = m Φβ ,

−λ∗
3 [ DαΦβ + DβΦα −1

(50)
The relations between the tetrad and the tensor components are:
Φα = e(a)
α Φa ,
Φ[αβ] = e(a)
α e(b)
β Φ[ab] ,
Φ(αβ) = e(a)
α e(b)
β Φ(ab) .
7We consider the notation ∇α described by the equality Dα = ∇α −ieAa(x).

V. V. Kisel, Ya. A. Voynova, E. M. Ovsiyuk et al.
As for (46), the system (50) can be reduced to the minimal form

[Dα, Dβ]−Φα = m Φβ ,

or, alternatively, to

3
m
[Dα, Dβ]−Ψα = m Ψβ ,
(51)
DαΨβ −DβΨα = m Ψ[αβ] .
Taking into account that
[Dα, Dβ]−Ψα = (−ieFαβ + Rαβ)Ψα ,
we conclude that the parameter λ3λ∗
3
m
in (51) determines both the anomalous
magnetic moment of the spin 1 particle and the additional interaction term with
non-Euclidean space-time background through the Ricci tensor Rαβ.
Conclusion
By applying the matrix 10-dimensional Dufﬁn–Kemmer-Petiau formalism to
the Shamaly–Capri ﬁeld, the behavior of a vector particle with anomalous mag-
netic moment is studied in the presence of external uniform magnetic ﬁeld. The
separation of variables in the wave equation is performed by using projective
operator techniques and the DKP-algebra theory. The problem is reduced to
a system of 2-nd order differential equations for three independent functions,
which are solved in terms of conﬂuent hypergeometric functions. Three series
of the energy levels are found; two of them substantially differ from those for
spin 1 particle without anomalous magnetic moment. To assign to them physical
sense for all the values of the main quantum number n = 0, 1, 2, ... one must
impose special restrictions on a parameter related to the anomalous moment.
Otherwise, the energy levels corresponds only partially of to bound states. The
neutral spin 1 particle is considered as well. In this case no bound states exist
in the system, and the main qualitative manifestation of the anomalous mag-
netic moment consists in the occurrence of space scaling of the arguments of
the wave functions, in comparison with a particle which has no such moment.
Some features of theory of the Shamaly–Capri particle within General Relativ-
ity are given.

Abstract 
Traditionally, the automotive industry has been the largest employer of 
robots, but their control is inline and programmed to follow planning trajectories. 
In this case, in the department motor’s test of Volkswagen Mexico a semi-
autonomous robot is developed. To date, some critical technical problems must 
be solved in a number of areas, including in dynamics control. Generally, the 
attitude estimation and the measurement of the angular velocity are a

requirements for the attitude control. As a result, the computational cost and the 
complexity of the control loop is relatively hight. This chapter deals with the 
implementation of a cheap Micro AHRS (Attitude and Heading Reference 
System) using low-cost inertial sensors. In the present chapter, the technique 
proposed is designed with attitude estimation and the prediction movement via 
the kinematic of a 4GDL robot. With this approach, only the measurements of at 
least two non-collinear directional sensors are needed. Since the control laws are 
highly simple and a model-based observer for angular velocity reconstruction is 
not needed, the proposed new strategy is very suitable for embedded 
implementations. The global convergence of the estimation and prediction 
techniques is proved. Simulation with some robustness tests is performed. 
 
Keywords: estimation, quaternion, prediction of the movement, robot, attitude, 
AHRS 
1. Introduction 
Robots have considerable potential for application in Volkswagen plants. Looking 
at the four major sectors of a vehicle assembly operation, as follow: 
 
1. PRESS. As a VW has installed high-speed pressed with integral part 
handling. 
2. BODY. They are seeking for robots that provide speed, accuracy, more 
payload capacity and are being easy to integrate. 
3. PAINTING. In this area they want to find robots that have the abilities to 
do such things as see and felt. 
 
In the motor test area, the assemblies of all of the instrumentation and wiring 
systems, and the test per se, autonomous robotic and telerobotic systems have 
been suggested. Industrial Robot has been considered for the different test. 
To date, some critical technical problem must be solved in a number of areas, 
including in dynamics and control. A prerequisite is state estimation where the 
states typically are position, velocity and orientation. State estimation is especially 
important where attitude control is needed. With attitude we refer to the robot’s 
orientation relative to the gravity vector, usually described by pitch and roll 
movements. Attitude estimation is usually performed by combining measurements 
from three kinds of sensors: rate gyros, inclinometers and accelerometers. 

A Quaternion Approach in the Estimation of the Attitude …

Figure 1. Robot and telerobotic systems. 
The attitude (orientation) of a rigid body can be parameterized by several 
methods: for instance, Euler’s angles, Cardan angles and unit quaternion. The unit 
quaternion is a four parameter representation with one constraint. Therefore, it 
yields the lowest dimensionality possible for a globally non-singular 
representation of the attitude. 
Several approaches have been applied to the attitude estimation problem. 
These estimators fall into three main families. The first one deals with a constraint 
least-square minimization problem proposed firstly by Wahba [1, 2], for finding 
the rotation matrix. 
The second approach is within the framework of the EKF (Extended Kalman 
filter) [3]. Its major feature concerns the ability to fuse signals acquired from 
different sensor types. An excellent survey of these methods is given in Ref. [4]. 
The third approach issues from nonlinear theory, and non linear observers are 
applied to the attitude determination problem [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. In this approach, the 
convergence of the error to zero is proved in a Lyapunov sense. 
In this chapter, an attitude estimator using quaternion representation is 
studied. Two approaches are jointly used, namely a constraint least-square 
minimization technique and a prediction technique. Thus, no assumptions of the 
weakness (or not) of the accelerations are done. Therefore, the main advantage of 
the approach presented in this chapter compared to others approaches, is that the 
estimated attitude remains valid even in the presence of high accelerations over 
long time periods. 
The chapter is organized as follows. First the algebra in a quaternion-based 
formulation of the orientation of rigid body is given. After, the problem statement 
and the kinematic model is formulated. Then attitude’s estimation and prediction 
via quaternion is presented. Finally, some simulation results are given.

2. Mathematical Background 
As mentioned in the introduction, the attitude of a rigid body can be represented 
by a unit quaternion, consisting of a unit vector 𝑒⃗ known as the Euler axis, and a 
rotation angle β about this axis. The quaternion 𝑞is then defined as follows: 
 
 
𝑞= (
𝑐𝑜𝑠
𝛽
2
𝑒⃗𝑠𝑖𝑛
𝛽
2
) = (
𝑞0
𝑞⃗) ∈ ℍ 
(1) 
 
where 
 
 
ℍ= 
{𝑞 ǀ 𝑞02 + 𝑞⃗𝑇𝑞⃗= 1 
𝑞= [𝑞0𝑞⃗𝑇]𝑇, 𝑞0 ∈ ℝ, 𝑞⃗ ∈ ℝ3} 
(2) 
 
𝑞⃗= [𝑞1𝑞2 𝑞3]𝑇 and 𝑞0 are known as the vector and scalar partis of the quaternion 
recpectively. In attitude control aplications, the unit quaternion represents the 
rotation from an inertial coordinate system 𝑁(𝑥𝑛,𝑦𝑛, 𝑧𝑛) located at some point in 
the space (for instance, the earth NED frame), to the body coordinate system 
𝐵(𝑥𝑏,𝑦𝑏, 𝑧𝑏) located on the center of mass of a rigid body. 
If 𝑟⃗ is a vector expressed in 𝑁, then its coordinates in 𝑩 are expressed by: 
 
 
𝑏= 𝑞̅ ⊗𝑟⊗𝑞 
(3) 
 
where 𝑏= [0 𝑏⃗⃗𝑇]
𝑇 and 𝑟= [0 𝑟⃗𝑇]𝑇 are the quaternions associated to vectors 𝑏⃗⃗ 
and 𝑟⃗ respectively. ⊗  denotes the quaternion multiplication and 𝑞̅ is the 
conjugate quaternion multiplication of q, defined as: 
 
 
𝑞̅ = [𝑞0−𝑞⃗𝑇]𝑇 
(4) 
 
The rotation matrix C(q) corresponding to the attitude quaternion q, is 
computed as: 
 
 
𝐶(𝑞) = (𝑞02 −𝑞⃗𝑇𝑞⃗)𝐼3 + 2(𝑞⃗𝑞⃗𝑇−𝑞0[𝑞⃗𝑥]) 
(5) 
 
where 𝐼3 is the identity matrix and [𝜉𝑥]is a skew symmetric tensor associated with 
the axis vector 𝜉:

(6) 
 
Thus, the coordinate of vector 𝑟⃗ expressed in the B frame is given by: 
 
 
𝑏⃗⃗= 𝐶(𝑞)𝑟⃗ 
(7) 
 
The quaternion attitude error used to quantify the mismatch between two 
attitudes 𝑞1 and 𝑞2 is computed by: 
 
 
𝑞𝑒= 𝑞1  ⊗ 𝑞̅2 
(8) 
 
The reason that quaternions found applications in computer graphics, 
computer vision, robotics, navigation, molecular dynamics, flight dynamics, and 
orbital mechanics, is their two distinct geometric interpretations. 
A. They can represent rotations in 3 and 4 space (and are called Rotation 
quaternions in this case). 
B. They can represent an orientation (rotation relative to a reference position) 
in 3D space, they are called orientation quaternions or attitude quaternions. 
Algorithmically they require a less number of operations to implement rotations 
(when compared with the multiplying a vector with a rotation matrix that involves 
Euler angles). Any rotation of a 4D vector can be represented by the product of 
two Quaternions with that vector. Two excellent references describing these 
details from an application perspective are: 
Note 
Each of the algebras of complex numbers, Quaternions, Octonions, Sedenions, 
etc. (or 2n-ons) are generalizations algebras of the previous in the list and they 
contain all the previous ones as sub-algebras, while all are special cases of 
Cayley-Dixon Algerbas or Hyperlinear Algebras as some are calling them. 
Although Quaternions are attributed to Hamilton (1843) it was C.F. Gauss 
who first discovered them earlier (1819) but published his work in 1900. Also, in 
1864 J.C. Maxwell in his first paper (before the book) on Electromagnetism 
(James Clerk Maxwell, “A Dynamical Theory of the Electromagnetic Field”

Society

3. Problem Statement 
Good models of industrial robots are necessary in a variety of applications, such 
as mechanical design, performance simulation, control, diagnosis, supervision and 
offline programming. This motivates the need for good modelling tools. In the 
first part of this book the foreword kinematic modelling of serial industrial robots 
is studied, the focus is on modelling the foreword kinematics. The main interest is 
the principal structure, and issues regarding efficiently implementation have not 
been considered. The work is based on homogeneous transformations using the 
Denavit-Hartenberg (D-H) representation, which gives coordinate frames adapted 
to the robot structure and a quaternion approach in the attitude estimation 
modelling is presented. 
Attitude is a term used to describe the orientation of a vehicle in three-
dimensional space. The attitude of the articulated arm can be described using 
several different parameters (e.g., quaternions, Euler angles, direction cosine 
matrices, etc.) that have been described in some detail in earlier chapters of this 
book. Robotic attitude determination systems provide a means for measuring or 
estimating these parameters that describe the end effector and the robot’s 
orientation. The outputs of these systems are used for vehicle guidance, 
navigation, and in this case, control and attitude determination. The focus of this 
chapter is attitude determination systems for small robots, which, for the purposes 
here, are defined to be robot with a total mass between 150 kg and 300 kg and fit 
in a volume envelope roughly 50 cm × 50 cm × 60 cm in dimension. Designing 
attitude determination systems for these small articulated robots represents a 
challenging and specialized task; sensors and their processing must also be made 
to fit within the limited size, weight, and mass specifications while still 
performing to high accuracies for many applications. This chapter highlights these 
challenges (particularly for a robot like showed in Figure 3) and discusses current 
and future developments aimed at addressing them. 
In the case of the attitude estimation, one seeks to estimate the attitude and 
accelerations of a rigid body. From now on, it is assumed that the system (AHRS) 
is equipped with a triaxis accelerometer, three magnetometery and three rate gyros 
mounted orthogonally. 
In this chapter, we describe the body’s kinematic of the model. In order to 
estimate the arm’s robot position with respect to an inertial frame, a module

91
containing three rate gyros, three accelerometer and three magnetometery 
assembled in tri-axis, are positioned in the extreme of the arm’s robot. Thus, the 
attitude for the articulation is estimated. The combination of this information 
jointly to a knowledge a priori of the robot makes possible to obtain information 
on the end effector respect to the base. 
3.1. Inertial Sensors 
Inertial sensors describe a pair of measurement devices used to determine a subset 
of the kinematic state of the body to which they are attached. The sensors are 
accelerometers, magmetometers and gyrometers. Accelerometers measure specific 
force—the algebraic sum of linear acceleration and gravitational acceleration 
normalized by mass. The name “accelerometer” is somewhat of a misnomer, as 
the sensor actually measures force rather than acceleration. However, by proper 
data scaling, a measurement of acceleration can be produced. A triad of 
accelerometers arranged orthogonally will measure the specific force vector of a 
vehicle. Gyrometers (or gyros for short) measures angular rate or integrated rate. 
Integrated rate is sometimes called “incremental angle” or simply “delta theta” 
∆𝜃. Lower cost (and quality) gyros tend to be rate gyros measuring rate, while 
higher end sensors are rate-integrating sensors whose output is ∆𝜃 Similarly, a 
triad of gyros will provide a measurement of the angular velocity vector. 
Normally, a triad of accelerometers and gyros are packaged together to form what 
is called an inertial measurement unit (IMU/AHRS). 
3.2. IMU/AHRS Kinematic Equations 
As opposed to the limited acceleration data from accelerometers, magnetometers 
and gyros can provide continuous useful information for attitude determination. 
The output of the triad of rate gyros is a measurement of the angular velocity 
𝜔𝑏/𝑖
𝑏. If rate-integrating gyros are used, then the output will be ∆𝜃𝑏/𝑖
𝑏. The 
subscript b/i indicates that these sensors measure the angular rate of the body 
frame relative to the inertial frame. The superscript indicates that this 
measurement is expressed in ℱ𝑏 Without a loss of generality, the discussion 
below will focus on the use of rate gyros and, thus, 𝑤= 𝜔𝑏/𝑖
𝑏 as the basic 
measurement processed. This is motivated, in part, by the fact that rate gyros are 
more typical in robotics applications.

The equation describing the relation between the quaternion and the body’s 
kinematic is given in introducing the angular variation 𝑤⃗⃗⃗= [𝑤𝑥𝑤𝑦𝑤𝑧]

4. Robot Configuration 
The robot links form a kinematic chain. When the kinematic chain is open, every 
link is connected to every other link by one and only one chain. If, on the other 
hand, a sequence of the links forms one or more loops, the robot contains closed 
kinematic chains. In Figure 2 example of configurations of robots is showed. 
 
 
 
 
IRB2400 has closed 
kinematic chains 
IRB340 FlexPicker has 
closed kinematic chains 
IRB6600 has an open 
kinematic structure 
Figure 2. Robot configurations found among the ABB robots. 
The robot has a closed kinematic chain due to the so-called parallelogram-
linkage structure, represented by a mechanical coupling between motor, placed on 
the foot of the robot, and the actual link 3. It can also be seen from the figure 
(from the ABB internet web site) that has an open kinematic-chain structure. 
Robots having an open kinematic chain can be divided into the following types, 
based on geometry. The Cartesian robot has three prismatic joints and the links 
are mutually orthogonal, which gives that each degree of mobility corresponds to 
a degree of freedom in the Cartesian space. Changing the first prismatic joint to a 
revolute joint gives a cylindrical geometry, where each degree of mobility 
corresponds to a degree of freedom in cylindrical coordinates. Replacing the first 
two prismatic joints by revolute joints gives a spherical robot, where the degrees 
of freedom are in spherical coordinates, similar to the cases above. SCARA stands

for selective compliance assembly robot arm, and a SCARA robot has a 
mechanical structure with high stiffness to vertical load and compliance to 
horizontal load. The anthropomorphic robot has three revolute joints, and has 
similarities to a human arm. The workspace is approximately a portion of a sphere 
and the robot structure can be seen in many industrial applications. The types are 
explained in more detail in Sciavicco and Siciliano (2000) and Spong et al. 
(2006), among others. The work in this thesis is limited to serial robots, that is, 
robots with an open kinematic structure, and the class of parallel robots that can 
be rewritten to this structure using a bilinear transformation. Especially serial 
robots having only revolute joints, so-called anthropomorphic robots, are studied. 
 
 
Figure 3. Virtual robot. 
In this chapter we obtain the attitude from the robot show in Figure 3 with an 
open kinematic structure. 
Using coordinate frames attached to each joint, shown in Figure 3, the 
position and orientation of the robot tool can be defined in the Cartesian 
coordinates Ci, with respect to the base frame R0 of the robot by successive 
coordinate transformations. This results in the relation.

sensor module.

According to the robot, the model for foreword kinematics based on the 
convention Denavit-Hartenberg is defined for each one of the coordinate systems 
in Table 1. 
This model can be compared with the quaternion-based model, which is 
Simplified in Table 2, so it is possible to observe that the quaternion-based model 
is significantly more compact, which reduces the number of operations 
significantly.

which are supposed to be orthogonally mounted. The output signal of a rate gyro 
is influenced by various factors, such as bias drift and noise. In the absence of 
rotation, the output signal can be modeled as the sum of a white Gaussian noise 
and of a slowly varying function. Since an integration step is required in order to 
obtain the current attitude quaternion (9), even the smallest variation of the rate

A Quaternion Approach in the Estimation of the Attitude …

6. Computation of the Attitude’s Estimation  
and Prediction 
The attitude estimator uses quaternion representation. Two approaches are jointly 
used, namely an estimation with a constraint least-square minimization technique 
and a prediction of the estate at the instant k. The prediction is performed in order 
to produce an estimate of the accelerations and the attitude quaternion. 
Actually, this latter problem is divided in three steps. First, the body 
accelerations are estimated from the previously computed quaternion. Then, the 
influence of the body accelerations is predicted from the accelerometer 
measurements together with the magnetometer measurements, a measure estate is 
estimated via an optimization technique. In this way, the quaternion that is 
obtained by the estimation with a constraint least-square is insensitive to the body 
accelerations. Thus, no assumptions of the weakness (or not) of the accelerations 
are done, and no switching procedure from one model to another one is necessary. 
Therefore, the main advantage of the approach presented in this chapter compared 
to others approaches, is that the estimated attitude remains valid even in the 
presence of high accelerations over long time periods. 
In this chapter, a critter that takes in account the evolution of the attitude state 
via determination of 𝑥= [𝑞𝑜, 𝑞1, 𝑞2, 𝑞3, 𝑎𝑥, 𝑎𝑦]𝑇 in the function 𝑓(𝑥) is proposed. 
The mínimum error is chosen, but it takes in account the prediction of the state 𝑥̂ 
and the coefficients of weight for the state 𝜇 and the measures estimated 
(MesEstimated = MS) at the instant k. 
 
 
𝑓(𝑥) = 
1
2 [𝜇(∑
(𝑀𝑒𝑠𝐸𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑑−𝑣𝑚𝑒𝑠(𝑗))
2
𝑛
𝑗=1
) + ‖𝑥̂ −𝑥‖2
2] 
(30) 
 
with 𝑞𝑇𝑞−1 = 0. 
The process of Estimation and Prediction needs the determination of his 
gradient; this one is obtained by equation (24) 
 
 
𝐻𝑞= [
𝜕
𝜕𝑞(
𝜕𝑓
𝜕𝑞
𝜕𝑞
𝜕𝑥)] 
 
𝐻𝑞= [
𝜕2𝑓
𝜕𝑞2
𝜕𝑞
𝜕𝑥]
𝑇
 
(31) 
 
Similarly, the gradient of the state for the case of acceleration is obtained. 
Finally, the total Gradient is obtained by the fusion between the calculation 
show for the quaternion case and the gradient omitted for the acceleration case.

] 
(32) 
 
For the prediction’s process of 𝑥̂, several tehcnique have been validated, for 
purpose of simplicity, the prediction via spline is chosen. Cubic spline is a spline 
constructed of piecewise third-order polynomials which pass through a set of n 
control points. 
Suppose we are n+1 data points (𝑥̂𝑘, 𝑀𝑆𝑘) such that. 
𝑎= 𝑥0 <. . < 𝑥𝑛, Then the coefficients of the vector 𝜇 exists cubic 
polynomials with coefficients 𝜇𝑖,𝑗0 ≤𝑖≤3 such that the following hold. 
 
 
𝜇(𝑥̂) = 𝜇𝑗(𝑥̂) = ∑
[𝑥̂ −𝑥𝑗]
𝑖 ∀𝑥̂  ∈ [𝑥̂ − 𝑥𝑗+1] 0 ≤ 𝑘 ≤𝑛−1
3
𝑗=0
 
 
 
𝜇(𝑥𝑗) = 𝑦𝑘 0 ≤𝑘 ≤𝑛−1 
 
 
𝜇𝑗(𝑥𝑗+1) = 𝜇𝑗+1(𝜇𝑗+1) 0 ≤𝑘≤𝑛−2 
 
 
𝜇𝑗
′(𝑥𝑗+1) = 𝜇𝑗+1
′
(𝑥𝑗+1) 0 ≤𝑘≤𝑛−2 
 
 
𝜇𝑗
′′(𝑥𝑗+1) = 𝜇𝑗+1
′′
(𝑥𝑗+1) 0 ≤𝑘≤𝑛−2 
 
So we see that the cubic spline not only interpolates the data (𝑥̂𝑘,𝑀𝑆𝑘) but 
matches the first and second derivatives at the knots. Notice, from the above 
definition, one is free to specify constrains on the endpoints. The end point 
constrain 𝜇′′(𝑎) = 0 𝜇′′(𝑏) =  0 is chosen. 
7. Results 
In this section, some simulation and results of the articulated arm (Figure 4) are 
represented in order to show the performance of the proposed control laws via 
quaternion. A rigid body with low momentum of inertia is taken as the 
experimental system. In fact, the low momentum of inertia makes the system 
vulnerable to high angular accelerations which prove the importance to apply the 
control.

The proposed technique is compared to the existing methods (namely, the 
MEKF (multiplicative extended Kalman filter) [10], (Control Force) [7] and the 
AEKF (additive Kalman filter) [11]. 
Initial conditions are set to extreme error values in order to assess the 
effectiveness of attitude estimation. These results are depicted in Figures 5 and 6. 
 
 
Figure 6. Estimation and prediction of the acceleration of the end effector. 
The proposed method performances are similar to those of the Extended 
Kalman Filter (Multiplicative and Additive). However, for example errors the 
convergence rate for our estimation-prediction is higher (As can be appreciated in 
Figure 7, the estimation has been made in a PC with 2GB in RAM, Intel®, Core™ 
Duo CPU T6400 @2.00Ghz 2.00GhZ). 
7.1. Experimental Results 
A Commercial Micro AHRS (Attitude and Heading Reference System) [12,13] is 
used to acquire the data instead of the MEMS sensor presented in section III 
((Robot showed in virtual reality Figure 3) and prototype in Figure 3. This AHRS

also provides the Euler angles. The methodology of estimation and prediction are 
implemented in real-time using the LabView environment. 
 
 
Figure 7. Estimation time Profile Summary. 
Remember that the attitude estimate is computed using a unit quaternion 
formulation. For comparison purpose, the estimate quaternion is converted into 
the rotation matrix. As can be shown, after large angular velocity change over a 
long period, the AHRS has a low convergence rate (approx. 1 min, Figure 8) 
compared to the one archived with our proposed methodology, onother advantage 
is that the problem of the “gimbal lock” is avoided (Figure 9 and Figure 10).

Figure 8. Experimental data. 
On the other hand, this system doesn’t provide the acceleration of the body so 
for validation we have done slowly movement and abrupt movement to appreciate 
the effect of the acceleration in our method. 
Conclusion 
The first key to keep in mind from this chapter is that hybrid methodogyes of 
attitude estimation via queternion, constitutes a viable alternative for improving 
the overall performance and robustness of embedded attitude estimation systems 
dealing with faulty sensor measurements. 
By modeling the sensor fusion problem via queternion within the hybrid 
systems framework, we are able to exploit the redundancy of information 
emerging from the different sensors in order to perform real-time diagnosis of 
their modes of operation, therefore allowing the attitude estimation system to 
compensate for both methodogies and unmodeled faulty behavior.

This chapter presents a new strategy for attitude estimation of possibly non-
symmetric rigid bodies. Two globally methods of calculation of the body’s 
attitude are proposed, namely one methodology fussing data information with a 
three-axis accelerometer, three magnetometer and three rate gyros mounted 
orthogonally jointly, with prediction of the movement via cubic splines are 
studied and simulated. Furthermore, the attitude estimation is independent of the 
body’s inertia. The numerical simulations have shown the effectiveness of the 
proposed methodologies and their robustness with respect to sensors noise and far 
initial points. Moreover, their simplicity makes them suitable for embedded 
implementation. This control estimation is tested in real application, consisting in 
a set of ABB 6 Degrees of Freedom robot mounted in the laboratory’s Motor.

Abstract 
The quaternions, reduced biquaternions (RBs) and their respective Fourier 
transformations, i.e., discrete quaternion Fourier transform (DQFT) and discrete 
reduced biquaternion Fourier transform (DRBQFT), are very useful for multi-
dimensional signal processing and analysis. In this paper, the basic concepts of 
quaternion and RB algebra are reviewed, and we introduce the two dimensional 
Hermite-Gaussian functions (2D-HGF) as the eigenfunction of DQFT/DRBQFT, 
and the eigenvalues of 2D-HGF for three types of DQFT and two types of 
DRBQFT. After that, the relation between 2D-HGF and Gauss-Laguerre circular 
harmonic function (GLCHF) is given. From the aforementioned relation and 
some derivations, the GLCHF can be proved as the eigenfunction of

DQFT/DRBQFT and its eigenvalues are summarized. These GLCHFs can be 
used as the basis to perform color image expansion. The expansion coefficients 
can be used to reconstruct the original color image and as a rotation invariant 
feature. The GLCHFs can also be applied to color matching applications. 
1. Introduction 
Properties of eigenvalues and eigenfunctions for Fourier transform and its variants 
are widely surveyed in the literatures. In 1982, Dickinson and Steiglitz [1] 
proposed a matrix which commutes with discrete Fourier transform (DFT) matrix 
and used this commuting matrix to compute orthonormal eigenfunctions for DFT. 
In the same year as [1], Grunbaum [2] discussed the Hermite function as 
eigenfunction of DFT. Later in 2006, Pei et al. [3] proposed a nearly tridiagonal 
commuting matrix to obtain orthonormal eigenfunctions for DFT with smaller 
error than [1]. In 2008, Santhanam et al. [4] inspired by the ideas from quantum 
mechanics in finite dimensions and presented an approach which computes 
commuting matrix whose eigenvalue spectrum is closely approximated to that of 
the Hermite-Gaussian differential operator. Recently in 2010, Pei et al. [5] derived 
the eigenvalues of discrete 2D-HGF for two-side DQFT [6] and two-side 
DRBQFT [7]. 
The quaternions have been applied to many research fields such as computer 
science, mathematics, signal processing and image processing, since Hamilton 
introduced the concept in 1843 [8]. The fundamental theorems are well developed, 
and mathematical operations like Fourier transform, wavelet transform, convolution 
of this four-dimensional, non-commutative algebra have been constructed maturely 
[9-16]. The usefulness and effectiveness of quaternions in dealing with multi-
dimensional computations are demonstrated, especially those involving operations 
of computer graphics and image processing, like three-dimensional rotations and 
many other geometrical transformations. However, there are many other interesting 
variants of quaternions like the biquaternions [17], the reduced biquaternions (RBs) 
[18], and the quad-quaternions [19], which are very useful and possess special 
properties and abilities that quaternions don’t have. 
These variants have also found several applications. Among these variants, in 
particular, we concentrate on discussing the quaternion, RBs and derive the 
eigenvalues and eigenfunctions for their DQFT/DRBFT. The multiplication rule of 
quaternions is non-commutative, on the other hand, the multiplication rule of RBs is 
commutative. The commutative property is one of the advantages of RBs over 
quaternions. Due to the commutativity of multiplications, many operations, such as 
Fourier transform, correlation, convolution, singular value decomposition (SVD), of 

2D Hermite-Gaussian and Gauss-Laguerre Circular Harmonic … 
111
RB algebra are much simpler and more convenient to the users than the ones of 
quaternion algebra. In [7], the efficient implementation of DRBQFT, convolution, 
correlation, phase-only correlation and RB linear-time-invariant and symmetric 
multichannel complex system are developed and they are much simpler than the 
existing implementation of quaternions. The commutative property is important and 
useful because the commutative DRBQFT is much simpler than non-commutative 
DQFT. In [20], the SVD of RB matrices are introduced. Compared with the 
quaternion matrix SVD, the complexity of the RB matrix SVD is reduced to a small 
factor of one-fourth. From the above discoveries, we can tackle with many 
arithmetic problems more efficiently in signal and image processing by using RBs. 
The RBs also have their limitations. The algebra of RBs is not a division algebra, 
and their geometric meaning is unfamiliar to most engineers. However, these 
problems have almost no influence on signal and image processing applications. We 
will briefly summarize the comparison of quaternions and RBs in the following 
section. In this work, we derive the eigenvalues of 2D-HGF for three types of 
DQFT and two types of DRBQFT, i.e., right-side, left-side and two-side for DQFT 
and type1, type2 for DRBQFT. By applying the relation between 2D-HGF and 
GLCHF mentioned in [21], we extended the conventional GLCHF in quaternion 
and RB spaces. We found that the GLCHF is the eigenfunction of left-side and 
right-side DQFT (type 1 and type2 DRBQFT), and the modified GLCHF is 
eigenfunction of two-side DQFT (type 1 and type2 DRBQFT). Over all, the major 
contribution of this paper are: 
 
1) Three types of DQFT (right-side, left-side, and two-side) and two types 
of DRBQFT (type1 and type2) are introduced. 
2) 2D 
Hermite-Gaussian 
and 
Gauss-Laguerre 
circular 
harmonic 
eigenfunctions and eigenvalues are derived for the above quaternion and 
reduced biquaternion Fourier transforms. 
3) Discrete 2D Gauss-Laguerre circular harmonic eigenfunctions can be 
efficiently computed using the linear combination coefficients and 2D 
discrete Hermite-Gaussian eigenfunctions. Both 2D eigenfunctions forms 
a complete and orthonormal basis in the 2D plane. 
4) DQFT and DRBQFT can be efficiently implemented using the 
conventional 2D FFT. 
5) Discrete 2D Gaussian-Laguerre circular harmonic functions are suitable 
for circular pattern analysis and expansions of the color images. 
6) Color image expansion, reconstruction, rotation invariant features, and 
color shape matching are proposed and demonstrated using GLCHFs for 
color image processing applications.

This paper is organized as follows. In section 2, the background knowledge 
and the fundamentals of the quaternions, RBs, 2D-HGF and GLCHF are briefly 
reviewed. Three types of DQFT and two types of DRBQFT are introduced and the 
eigenvalue derivation of 2D-HGF, GLCHF, and modified GLCHF for these 
transformations are discussed in section 3.In section 4, we demonstrate the spatial 
and spectral domain results of GLCHF and modified GLCHF to justify our 
proposition of eigenvalues and derivations in section 2. The GLCHFs are also 
used to perform color image expansion and color matching. Two reconstruction 
methods are proposed for different purpose and apply these methods to 
reconstruct color image. We also found that the expansion coefficients can also be 
used as a rotation invariant feature. Section 5 concludes this work. 
2. Preliminaries 
2.1. Quaternions 
The quaternions can be viewed as a four-dimensional vector space defined over 
real numbers. The quaternions are also generalizations of complex numbers. A 
quaternion consists of four components, i.e., one real part and three imaginary 
parts. A quaternion is often represented as the following form:

2.2. Reduced Biquaternions 
The idea of reduced biquaternions (RBs) was suggested by Schtte and Wenzel [18] 
in 1990. Other similar ideas can be found in the articles about bicomplex algebra 
[22-24]. They [18] proposed to apply the RBs to the implementation of digital filter, 
and demonstrated that fourth order real filter can be realized by means of a first 
order RB filter. The RBs are another types of four-dimensional hypercomplex 
numbers, and are also represented as the form of (1), but {1, i , j , k } obeys 
different multiplication rules from those of (2). The rules are given by:

multiplication 
rules.

qq  is still a RB. There are three different

these three conjugates are still not real, therefore, we define the modulus and 
conjugate of RB as follows:

. Therefore,
1e and

complex numbers and quaternions, the idempotent elements are only 0 and 1, and 
the divisor of zero is only the number 0. For RBs,

use of 
1e  and

We only need two instead of four complex multiplications to calculate the 
multiplication of two RBs. 
However, the real addition operations are increased from 12 to 16. The 
complexity of multiplication for quaternions, RBs, and 
1e -
2e form of RBs is 
summarized in Table 1. The comparison of quaternions and RBs is shown in 
Table 2 for readers to understand their main differences.

The eigenvalue of 1D-HGF for DFT is well-known and its (−𝜇)𝑎, where a is 
the order of HGF and 𝜇 is transform axis of DFT. Therefore, from the derivation 
of (18), we know that the eigenvalue of 2D-HGF 𝐻𝑎𝑏(𝑚, 𝑛) for left-side QFT is 
(−𝜇)𝑎+𝑏.

From (22), we realize that the eigenvalue of 2D-HGF 𝐻𝑎𝑏(𝑚, 𝑛) for two-side 
QFT is (−𝜇1)𝑎(−𝜇2)𝑏. 
3.1.6. Eigenvalue Derivation of Modified GLCHFs 𝑳𝒂𝒃(𝒎, 𝒏) ∙(𝝁𝟏+ 𝝁𝟐) 
and (𝝁𝟏+ 𝝁𝟐) ∙𝑳𝒂𝒃(𝒎, 𝒏) for Two-Side QFT 
For two-side QFT we have to change the form of original GLCHF 𝐿𝑎𝑏(𝑚, 𝑛) in 
order to obtain eigenvalues. The modified GLCHFs are defined as 𝐿𝑎𝑏(𝑚, 𝑛) ∙
(𝜇1 + 𝜇2) and (𝜇1 + 𝜇2) ∙𝐿𝑎𝑏(𝑚, 𝑛). 𝐿𝑎𝑏(𝑚, 𝑛) can be written as 𝑅+ 𝜇1𝐼 or 𝑅+
𝜇2𝐼, where 𝜇1and 𝜇2 are unit pure quaternions and they are also transformation 
axes, 𝑅 and 𝐼 are linear combinations of 2D-HGFs. We denote modified GLCHF 
of first kind as MGLCHF I, and GLCHF of second kind as MGLCHF II. Before 
we proceed to find the eigenvalues of modified GLCHFs for two-side QFT, a

simple theorem is introduced first and it may be helpful for us to derive the 
eigenvalues. 
 
Theorem 1. For any unit pure quaternions uand v, we have: 
 
 
 (−u)𝑛(u + v) = (u + v)(−v)𝑛 
(23) 
 
Proof. When n = 0, (23) is obviously true. Assume n = k, we have: 
 
 
 (−u)𝑘(u + v) = (u + v)(−v)𝑘 
(24) 
 
Then, 
(−u)𝑘+1(u + v) = (−u)𝑘(−u)(u + v) = (−u)𝑘(1 −uv) = (−u)𝑘∙
(−uv + 1) = (−u)𝑘(u + v)(−v) = (u + v)(−v)𝑘 (−v) = (u + v)(−v)𝑘+1(by 
(24)), where u2 = v2 = −1. Therefore, according to the mathematical induction, 
the proof is completed. In what follows, we derive the eigenvalues of MGLCHFs 
for two-side QFT: 
For MGLCHF of first kind, 𝐿𝑎𝑏(𝑚, 𝑛) ∙(𝜇1 + 𝜇2):

From (25), we know that the eigenvalue of MGLCHF of first kind, 
𝐿𝑎𝑏(𝑚, 𝑛) ∙(𝜇1 + 𝜇2) for two-side QFT is (−𝜇2)𝑎+𝑏. On the other hand, from 
(26), we can see that the eigenvalue of MGLCHF of second kind, (𝜇1 + 𝜇2) ∙
𝐿𝑎𝑏(𝑚, 𝑛) for two-side QFT is (−𝜇1)𝑎+𝑏.

4. Experimental Results 
4.1. Verification of Derived Eigenvalue 
First, we use Matlab, QTFM toolbox [27] developed by Sangwine et al. and our 
reduced biquaternion toolbox to perform DQFT and DRBQFT for 2D-HGF, 
GLCHF, MGLCHF I and MGLCHF II. The transformed spectrums of functions 
mentioned above and the ratio of spectrum to original function multiplied by 
derived eigenvalue, i.e., 1, will be demonstrated to verify the results summarized 
in Table 3. For QFT, we verify all cases in Table 3. Because of the page limit, we 
only verify 2D-HGF for DRBQFT II, and MGLCHF I&II for DRBQFT I. The 
parameters and methods used in these experiments are summarized in Table 4 and 
the experimental results are shown in Figure 4~13. 
 
Case 1 to 3. 2D-HGF/L-DQFT, 2D-HGF/R-DQFT, 2D-HGF/T-DQFT 
We can see from Figure 4 to 6 that the transformed spectrum L-DQFT(𝐻30) is 
equivalent to original function multiplied by derived eigenvalue (−𝜇)3+0 ∗𝐻30, 
R-DQFT(𝐻21) is equivalent to 𝐻21 ∗(−𝜇)2+1, and T-DQFT(𝐻12) is equivalent to 
𝐻12 ∗(− 𝜇1)1(− 𝜇2)2. 
 
Case 4 to 7. GLCHF/L-DQFT, GLCHF/R-DQFT, MGLCHF I/T-DQFT, 
MGLCHF II/T-DQFT 
It can be seen from Figure 7 to 10 that L-DQFT(𝐿30) is equivalent to 
(−𝜇)3+0 ∗𝐿30, R-DQFT(𝐿30) is equivalent to 𝐿30 ∗(−𝜇)3+0, T-DQFT(𝐿30(𝜇1 +
𝜇2)) is equivalent to 𝐿30(𝜇1 + 𝜇2) ∗(− 𝜇2)3+0. T-DQFT((𝜇1 + 𝜇2)𝐿30) is 
equivalent to (− 𝜇1)3+0 ∗𝐿30(𝜇1 + 𝜇2). 
 
Case 8 to 9. 2D-HGF/DRBQFT II, MGLCHF I&II/DRBQFT I 
As depicted by Figure 11 and 12, DRBQFT I (𝐻03) is equivalent to 𝐻03 ∗
(− 𝑢1)0+3, 
DRBQFT 
I 
(𝐿30(𝑢1 + 𝑢3)) 
is 
equivalent 
to 
𝐿30 ∗
(− 𝑢1)3(− 𝑢3)0.Besides, Figure 13 demonstrate that ratio of spectrum to function 
multiplied by eigenvalue is equal to one (only middle part is shown). The phase 
errors shown in the border of Figure 4(b) to 12 (b) are due to finite-length effect 
of DQFT and DRBQFT and limited computational precision of Matlab.

4.2. Color Image Expansion and Partial Reconstruction Using 
GLCHFs 
From the above experiments and discussions, we know that GLCHFs are the 
eigenfunctions of DQFT and DRBQFT. Therefore, GLCHFs possess some useful 

2D Hermite-Gaussian and Gauss-Laguerre Circular Harmonic … 
133 
properties, such as shape invariance under DQFT and DRBQFT. We can 
represent GLCHFs as a 2D quaternion or 2D RB functions and use them as basis 
to expand quaternion encoded color images 𝐼𝑄(𝑚, 𝑛), or RB encoded color images 
𝐼𝑅𝐵 (𝑚, 𝑛), i.e.,

where 𝑅(m, n) is the red color channel, 𝐺(m,n) is the green color channel, and 
𝐵(m,n) is the blue color channel of the color image, respectively. {𝑖, 𝑗, 𝑘} is the

𝐿𝑠−𝑡,𝑡
𝑅𝐵
(m,n) is RB encoded 2D GLCHF basis of order (s-t,t). For convenience, the 
representation of order (s-t,t) is replaced with (a,b). From (40), we see that 
quaternion/RB encoded color images can be expanded by using infinite number of 
expansion coefficients and GLCHFs. However, only some of the expansion 
coefficients and GLCHFs is useful and meaningful for image reconstruction task, 
only part of these coefficients and GLCHFs are retained and applied to partially 
reconstruct the original color image. As illustrated in Figure14, the square 
represents the domain of expansion coefficients  ℎ𝑎,𝑏
𝑄 𝑜𝑟  ℎ𝑎,𝑏
𝑅𝐵, and the shaded area 
is the coefficients that will be used. Two parameters K and L can be determined to 
do sifting of coefficients in the domain and define the shape of shaded area. In 
what follows, we perform several experiments to test the efficiency of partial 
reconstruction. The test color images are N by N pixels, where N is set to 64. Two 
methods are proposed to sift expansion coefficients of interests as follows: 
 
Method 1. 
For a fixed K, we increase L from zero to a predefined number (the increment 
step d can be verified). The sum of order (a+b) satisfy the following constraint, 
 
 
(a + b) =L≤2N+2 
(41) 

Soo-Chang Pei and Yu-Zhe Hsiao 
134 
and the absolute difference |𝑎−𝑏| satisfy another constraint, 
 
 
|𝑎−𝑏| ≤𝑁<K 
(42) 
 
From Figure 15, the partially reconstructed color images by using the sifted 
expansion coefficients  ℎ𝑎,𝑏
𝑄 𝑜𝑟  ℎ𝑎,𝑏
𝑅𝐵 with method 1reveal the details of image 
circularly and gradually. We cannot recognize the content of original image well 
when the order (a + b = L) is low, but when the order (a + b = L) is high, e.g., L 
= 100 ~ 130, we only use finite, small number of coefficients and GL-CH basis to 
approximate original images. It can be seen that the approximated images are 
visually pleasing with high fidelity. 
 
Method 2. 
For a fixed L, increasing K from zero to a predefined number (41) and (42) 
are also satisfied. From Figure 16, the partially reconstructed color images by 
using the sifted expansion coefficients  ℎ𝑎,𝑏
𝑄 𝑜𝑟  ℎ𝑎,𝑏
𝑅𝐵 with method 2 approximate 
the support of the original image. We can recognize the content and support size 
of original image even when the order (K) is low. As for K is high, the 
approximations are slightly inferior to those of L is high, especially in the border 
of the reconstructed images. This is because the main purpose of method 2 is to 
obtain the support and roughly sketch of original images.

4.4. Color Shape Matching by Using GLCHFs 
In section 4.2, we proposed a method for color image decomposition. In this 
section, we further use the decomposition and quaternions/RBs algebra and 
propose novel color shape matching algorithm for jersey. We briefly summarize 
our color shape matching algorithms as follows and demonstrate some 
experimental results to verify our method by using GLCHFs and RBs. The test 
input images are depicted as follows (Figures 18-21).

is nearly circular or ellipsoidal, therefore we can use GLCHFs circularly

approximated color patch to do correlation and thus find out the locations of 
human or children in our test target images. 
 
7. From the phase-only correlation result, we have found the candidate 
positions of matched objects. 
 
Then, to determine if the average of brightness, chromaticity, hue, or 
saturation of these objects are the same as the one of the color patch, we define 
three parameters and their requirements as follows:

8. Finally, we can find the location of human object and match the colors or 
their clothes by eq.(55). 
 
Bellow (see Figure 32-34) are results of the color matching by applying above 
methods. We can see that the locations of human can be found and after 
thresholding, we can successfully accomplish the color matching mask of their 
clothes by using patches with different colors 
Conclusion 
In this work, we derive the eigenvalues of 2D-HGFs and GLCHFs for DQFT and 
DRBQFT. The experimental results verify our derivations. Two partial 
reconstruction methods of color image are proposed based on GLCHFs and the 
reconstructed results demonstrate the efficacy and usefulness of our methods. We 
also show that the expansion coefficients can be used as a rotation invariant 
feature and also propose a novel method to perform color shape matching of 
human jersey effectively.

Abstract
The unit quaternion system was invented in 1843 by William Rowan
Hamilton as an extension to the complex number to ﬁnd an answer to
the question (how to multiply triplets?). Yet, quaternions are extensively
used to represent the attitude of a rigid body such as quadrotors, which is
able to alleviate the singularity problem caused by the Euler angles rep-
resentation. The singularity is in general a point at which a given mathe-
matical object is not deﬁned and it outcome of the so called gimbal lock.
The singularity is occur when the pitch angles rotation is θ = ±90o.
In this chapter, a leader-follower formation control problem of quadro-
tors is investigated. The quadrotor dynamic model is represented by unit
quaternion with the consideration of external disturbance. Three differ-
ent control techniques are proposed for both the leader and the follower
robots. First, a nonlinear H∞design approach is derived by solving a
Hamilton-Jacobi inequality following from a result for general nonlinear

addressed for the leader-follower formation control problem. Then, an
iterative Linear Quadratic Regulator (iLQR) is derived to solve the prob-
lem of leader-follower formation. The simulation results from all types
of controllers are compared and robustness performance of the H∞con-

Introduction
In the last decade, the focus on control single unit quadrotors has expanded
to controlling a team of quadrotors for these to be able to achieve their tasks
in variable weather and complicated environments. Team formation ﬂight also
provides advantages over the use of an individual quadrotor in both civil and
military applications, such as inspection of an inaccessible area, disaster man-
agement, and search and rescue in risky circumstances, etc. Most of these
applications demand more than one quadrotor to accomplish the desired ob-
jective [1, 2]. The leader-follower approach is one of the main approaches of
formation control design.
Distributed and decentralised control techniques were used in the literature
to solve the leader-follower control problem. The distributed control technique
assumes that not all followers receive the leader’s information and there is a kind
of cooperation among them [3–14], while the decentralised control technique
proposes that all followers are able to receive the leader’s information [15–24].
Different controllers have been implemented with both distributed and decen-
tralised control techniques.
1.1.
Distributed Control Technique
A robust LQR controller was proposed for individual quadrotors and team
formation as well in [6]. The controller was designed for a linearised sys-
tem around the hovering point. The simulation results indicated the ability of
the controller to overcome the changes in communication topology among the
robots with no dynamic effects. A NNs controller was presented in [3] for ad-
dressing the leader-follower problem. These two studies used Lyapunov theory
to analyse the controller stability.

The Quaternions with an Application of Quadrotors Team Formation 155
A BS controller was discussed in [8] based on graph theory to maintain
the distance among the robots and in [5] with balanced graph and strong con-
nection among the robots. The quadrotors’ dynamic systems were linearised
around the hovering point and a good performance was obtained in normal cir-
cumstances. A distributed cohesive motion control scheme was presented in [9]
for 3D motion to maintain the distance among robots. This technique was devel-
oped to become a decentralised technique and signiﬁcant attempts to deal with
decentralised control techniques have been made. Three time scale controllers
based on the sliding mode controller were proposed in [4] for dealing with the
quadrotor formation problem. The controllers were used for the path tracking,
attitude tracking and velocity in order to keep the formation and maintain the
distance among the robots with the presence of external disturbance affecting
the leader robot only. The simulation results proved the effectiveness of the
proposed scheme.
A nonlinear control theory was presented to ensure the stability of quadro-
tors team formation in [7]. The wireless communication among the team was
obtained via medium access control protocols. Experimental tests veriﬁed the
proposed algorithm with time delay consideration. In [10] the problem of the
leader-follower consensus of a swarm of rigid body space crafts system was
analysed based on quaternion representation using a distributed control tech-
nique. They assumed that the communication between two neighbouring fol-
lowers is bidirectional and that all followers can receive the leader information.
Stability analysis was obtained via Lyapunov theory and the simulation results
proved the attitude and angular velocity tracking stability. In [11] a MPC tech-
nique with integrated trajectory planning was analysed with a planning horizon
for both team formation and obstacle avoidance. The method showed good sim-
ulation results. A distributed coordinated control scheme was proposed by [12]
to solve the problem of time-delay in leader-follower team formation commu-
nication of quadrotors and the simulation results under sufﬁcient conditions
demonstrated the validity of the presented control technique. Xiwang et al. [13]
proposed a consensus-based approach for the time varying formation control
problem. The simulation and the practical test of ﬁve quadrotors demonstrated
the validation of the proposed control approach. A vision-based servoing dis-
tributed control approach was presented in [14], where the quadrotors equipped
cameras to track a moving target which provided the position information to be
used for controllers.

Decentralised Control Technique
Abdessameud and Tayebi [15] proposed a procedure which depends on a quater-
nion representation and is split up into translational and rotational control design
under the upper bounded translational control input. Analysis of the closed-loop
system stability was achieved using Lyapunov theory. The proposed strategy
took 8 seconds to catch the desired formation shape. A hybrid supervisory
control based on a polar partitioning approach was suggested in [16] for the
team formation problem and for collision avoidance as well. The combination
of discrete quadrotors dynamic system and the supervisor was achieved using
the parallel composition and the simulation results displayed that this method
allows the supervisors to achieve a free collision in normal environments. A
MPC technique was proposed in [21], where its hierarchical control effective-
ness was compared with the potential ﬁeld technique. The stability of the feed-
back controller based on ﬂuid dynamic models in [17] was obtained based on
smoothed-particle hydrodynamic. The simulation results of the above methods
validated the proposed approaches.
Authors in [18] proposed the trajectory planners and feedback controllers
for following the planned trajectory. Next they proposed a nonlinear decen-
tralised controller for an aggressive formation problem in the micro quadrotors
team in [19]. Communication failures and network time delays impact on team
formation efﬁciency were considered. Local information of neighbour robots in
the team was used for individual trajectory planning. Preserving the required
form was based on the status estimation of neighbour robots. Then the authors
presented two approaches to overcome the problem of concurrent assignment
and planning of trajectories (CAPT) for the quadrotors team, a decentralised
D-CAPT and centralised C-CAPT in [20]. The decentralised D-CAPT and cen-
tralised C-CAPT results were compared in simulation and practice and the ex-
perimental results demonstrated a good performance in indoor application.
In [25] a human user for teleoperation with a haptic device was proposed
for the quadrotor team formation control problem with the cooperation of a BS
controller. The simulation results revealed the ability of the human user to tele-
operate in order to perform the formation. A triangle formation control of three
quadrotors using optimal control techniques via the Pontryagin maximum prin-
ciple was presented in [26] and the simulation results showed the effectiveness
of using team formation rather than using an individual quadrotor in terms of
fuel consumption. In [27] a consensus problem of swarm systems was discussed

The Quaternions with an Application of Quadrotors Team Formation 157
to obtain the time-varying formation based on double-integrator system mod-
elling. The experimental results of the three quadrotors in formation veriﬁed
the effectiveness of the proposed approach in dynamic-free conditions.
A new developed framework gathering with a nonlinear MPC technique was
presented in [28] to solve the problem of coalition formation. The simulation
results showed a zero steady state error in free disturbance and dynamic circum-
stances. Koksal et al. [22] presented an adaptive formation scheme for quadro-
tors leader-follower formation. They proposed a distributed control scheme for
the kinematic part, an adaptive LQ controller for pitch and roll angles, pro-
portional control for yaw angle and a PID controller for altitude. Several sce-
narios were implemented in simulation and experiment to validate the algo-
rithm. In [23] a combination of LQR and SM controllers were proposed for a
2D quadrotors leader-follower formation, where the LQR controller was used
for position control while two SM controllers were used for the attitude and
for maintaining the distance between the robots. The simulation results demon-
strated the successfulness of combining the two control techniques. A BS con-
trol approach with nonlinear controllers was introduced for handling the team
formation problem in [24] and the simulation results proved the effectiveness of
the proposed controllers.
The results in most of the previous papers on leader-follower formation
control of multi-quadrotor system did not consider the effect of external dis-
turbances, such as payload changes (or mass changes), wind disturbance, in-
accurate model parameters, etc., which often affected the quadrotors’ control
performance. Therefore, a quadrotor controller must be robust enough in order
to reject the effect of disturbances and cover the change in model parameter
uncertainties and external disturbances. Robust state feedback controllers are
very demanding when dealing with the quadrotor control problem. The H∞
control approach was able to attenuate the disturbance energy by measuring the
ratio between the energy of cost vector and the energy of disturbance signal
vector [29].
The rest of this chapter is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the
quadrotor dynamical model derivation based on quaternion representation. Sec-
tion 3 introduces the leader-follower formation control problem with one leader
and one follower in a distributed way. Section 4 provides a review on H∞
optimal control approach. The main result of this approach is given as well,
including the details of the designed state feedback controller for the formation
problem. In section 5, presents the integral backstepping concept and the forma-

tion controllers with its stability analysis. In section 6, presents the derivation
of iLQR controller for the leader and the follower. Section 7 shows the per-
formance of the presented controllers while the conclusions of this study are
indicated in section 8.

Mathematical Model
To control the motion and rotation of the quadrotor UAV, the mathematical dy-
namic model should be achieved. The quadrotor UAV system has a nonlinear
dynamic system and complicated structure; therefore, it is difﬁcult to represent
its motion and rotation in a simple model. The dynamic model of the quadrotor
UAV depends on some assumptions [30]:
• The structure of the quadrotor is rigid and symmetrical;
• The propellers are rigid;
• The centre of mass and body ﬁxed frame are coincides;
• Thrust and drugs are proportional to the square of the propellers; and
• The difference of gravity by altitude or the spin of the earth is minor.
According to these assumptions, the mathematical model can be derived to
perform the quadrotor UAV fuselage dynamics in space, where it will be easy to
add to it the effects of aerodynamic forces generated by the rotation of the pro-
pellers. The coordinate reference system of the quadrotor includes two frames
of reference, the inertial (earth ﬁxed) frame mentioned I(xI, yI, zI) and the
rigid (body ﬁxed) frame mentioned B(xB, yB, zB). Several techniques can be
used to perform the rigid body rotation in space such as Euler angles, Quater-
nions and Tait-Bryan angles [8]. The method used to describe the position and
orientation of the quadrotor is the quaternion method. It is a hyper complex
number of 4-tuple (q0, q1, q2, q3) ∈R4 which can be written in many ways as
Q = q0 + q1i + q2j + q3k and Q = [q0, qT ]T [31] [32] [33].
The north east down (NED) coordinate system is used to parametrise the
dynamic model of the quadrotor with an angle of one-axis rotation α around the
Euler axis of unit vector k ∈R3 which has a direct physical connection and can
be written as:
Q =

The unit quaternion can be used to represent the coordinate transforma-
tion between the inertial frame I and the body frame B by deﬁning the mul-
tiplication and the inverse quaternion. The multiplication of two quaternions
Q = [q0, qT ]T and Q′ = [q′
0, q′T ]T is deﬁned as:

The inverse unit quaternion is deﬁned as Q−1 = [q0, −qT ]T for Q = [q0, qT ]T .
A vector xI ∈R3 in the inertial frame can be expressed as a vector xB ∈R3 in
the body frame via xB = RT xI. Using ¯x = [0, xT ]T , the transformation from
the inertial frame to the body frame is expressed as ¯xB = Q−1 ⊗¯xI ⊗Q.
And if the norm of the quaternion is equal to one ∥Q∥= 1, it means that
the inverse is the same as the conjugate, which is the case used to represent the
coordinate transformation between the inertial frame I and the body frame B
by deﬁning the multiplication and the inverse quaternion. The multiplication of
two quaternions Q = [q0, qT ]T and Q′ = [q′
0, q′T ]T is deﬁned as:

Quaternion Kinematics
The kinematic equations of the movements of a unit quaternion Q(t) can be
driven by rotating the quadrotor with its angular velocity vector ω in the three
directions to make a slight change in the movement of the quadrotor ∆t and the
change will be as follows [35]:

where ∆α = ω∆t. Then if ∆t is considered small, these expressions hold,
cos( ∆α

can be written as:

external forces applied to the centre mass which is distinct in the body ﬁxed
frame can be separated into translational and rotational motions and it can be

Leader-Follower Formation Problem for Quadrotors

which is able to alleviate the singularity problem caused by the Euler angles
representation . The full dynamic model of a quadrotor can be written as:

where i is L for the leader and F for the follower, mi is the quadrotor mass,
ωi = [ωix, ωiy, ωiz]T is the angular velocity in the body frame, Ji is the 3 × 3
diagonal matrix representing three inertial moments in the body frame, G(ωi)

Leader-Follower Formation Control Problem
One leader and one follower are considered in the leader-follower formation
control problem to be solved in this work. The leader control problem is formu-
lated as a trajectory tracking problem, and the follower control problem is also
formulated as a tracking problem, but with a different tracking target.
The follower will keep its yaw angle (qF0, qF3) as the same as the leader
when it maintains the formation pattern. It will moves to a desired position
pFd, which is determined by a desired distance d, a desired incidence angle ρ,
and a desired bearing angle σ. A new frame F ′ is deﬁned by the translation of
the leader frame L to the frame with the desired follower position pFd as the
origin. As shown in ﬁgure 1, the desired incidence angle is measured between
the desired distance d and x −y plane in the new frame F ′, and the desired
bearing angle is measured between x axis and the projection of d in x −y plane
in the new frame F ′. The desired position pFd is
pFd = pL −RT
Ld


cos ρ cos σ
cos ρ sin σ
sin ρ


where pL is the leader position.

The Quaternions with an Application of Quadrotors Team Formation 167
Now, the formation control problem for the follower is to satisfy the follow-
ing conditions:



limt→∞(pFd −pF ) = 0
limt→∞(qL0 −qF0) = 0
limt→∞(qL3 −qF3) = 0
(40)
The leader just tracks a desired trajectory represented by (pLd, qL0d, qL3d).
So, the formation control problem for the leader is to satisfy the following con-
ditions:



limt→∞(pLd −pL) = 0
limt→∞(qL0d −qL0) = 0
limt→∞(qL3d −qL3) = 0
(41)
In summary, the leader-follower formation control problem to be solved in
this work is a distributed control scheme, i.e. the leader and the follower have
their own individual controllers without the need for a centralised unit. Assume
both the leader and the follower are able to obtain their own pose information
and the follower is able to obtain the leader’s pose information via wireless
communication. The design goal of the controllers is to ﬁnd the state feedback
control law for the thrust and torque inputs for both the leader and the follower.
The leader-follower formation control problem is solved if both the conditions
(40) and (41) are satisﬁed.
The communication among the agents is assumed to be available. The po-
sition pL, quaternion components qL0 and qL3 of the leader L and its ﬁrst and
second derivatives ˙qL0, ¨qL0, ˙qL3 and ¨qL3 are assumed available and measurable.
The linear velocity of the leader L and its derivative vL and ˙vL are assumed
bounded and available for the follower.

Formation H∞Controllers
The controller design for the leader and the follower is based on H∞suboptimal
control. The follower H∞controller is designed by following the introduction
of an error state model, and the introduction of a H∞control theorem for general
afﬁne systems. Then the leader H∞controller is brieﬂy presented later.

Follower State Error Model
The control strategy for the follower is to track the desired position pFd. The
tracking errors for the follower according to the nonlinear dynamic system (39)
can be written as:
˜pF = pFd −pF
˜vF = vFd −vF
 ˜qF0
˜qF

=
 qF0d −qF0
qFd −qF

˜ωF = ωFd −ωF
where vFd = ˙pFd is the desired linear velocity, [qF0d, qFd]T = [qL0, 0, 0, qL3]T
is the desired quaternion, and [ωFd] = [0, 0, 0]T is the desired angular velocity.

H∞Suboptimal Control Approach
In this section, a brief overview on H∞suboptimal control approach is summa-
rized for systems of the form:
 ˙x = f(x) + g(x)u + k(x)d
y = h(x)
(44)
where x ∈Rn is a state vector, u ∈Rm is an input vector, y ∈Rp is an output
vector, and d ∈Rq is a disturbance vector. Detailed information on H∞control
approach can be found in [29].
We assume the existence of an equilibrium x∗, i.e. f(x∗) = 0, and we also
assume h(x∗) = 0. Given a smooth state feedback controller:
 u = l(x)
l(x∗) = 0
(45)
The H∞suboptimal control problem considers the L2-gain from the disturbance
d to the vector of z = [yT , uT ]T . This problem is deﬁned below.
Problem 1. Let γ be a ﬁxed nonnegative constant. The closed loop system
consisting of the nonlinear system (44) and the state feedback controller (45) is
said to have L2-gain less than or equal to γ from d to z if
Z T
0
∥z(t)∥2dt ≤γ2
Z T

∥d(t)∥2dt + K(x(0))
(46)
for all T ≥0 and all d ∈L2(0, T) with initial condition x(0), where 0 ≤
K(x) < ∞and K(x∗) = 0.
For the nonlinear system (44) and γ

Theorem 1.
[29] If there exists a smooth solution V ≥0 to the Hamilton-
Jacobi inequality:
Hγ(x, V (x)) ≤0; V (x∗) = 0
(48)

The Quaternions with an Application of Quadrotors Team Formation 171
then the closed-loop system for the state feedback controller:
u = −gT (x)∂T V (x)
∂x
(49)
has L2-gain less than or equal to γ, and K(x) = 2V (x).
The nonlinear system (44) is called zero-state observable if for any trajec-
tory x(t) such that y(t) = 0, u(t) = 0, d(t) = 0 implies x(t) = x∗.
Proposition 1. [29] If the nonlinear system (44) is zero-state observable and
there exists a proper solution V ≥0 to the Hamilton-Jacobi inequality, then
V (x) > 0 for x(t) ̸= x∗and the closed loop system (44), (49) with d = 0 is
globally asymptotically stable.

troller in this section. The following form of energy function V is suggested for

It is trivial to show that the nonlinear system (43) is zero-state observable
for the equilibrium point x∗F . Further due to the fact that V (xF ) ≥0 and it
is a proper function (i.e. for each β > 0 the set {xF : 0 ≤V (xF ) ≤β}
is compact), the closed-loop system (43), (51) with dF = 0 is asymptotically
locally stable for the equilibrium point x∗F according to Proposition 1. This
proves the second part of the theorem.
Remark 1. It should be noted that the proof of Theorem 2, limt→∞˜pF = 0,
limt→∞˜qF = 0, limt→∞˜vF = 0 and limt→∞˜ωF = 0, meets the conditions of

Integral Backstepping Follower Formation Control
Integral backstepping control is one of popular control approaches for both indi-
vidual and multiple quadrotors. In this section, it will be applied for the leader-
follower formation problem. The leader and the follower desired quaternions
are assumed to be qL1d = qL2d = 0 and qF1d = qL1 and qF2d = qL2. An IBS
controller for the follower is developed ﬁrst. The IBS controller for the leader is

from our previous work [39] and its main result is just presented in this section.
They will be used in the simulation later for evaluating the robustness of H∞
controllers.
5.1.
Follower Integral Backstepping Controller
The IBS controller for the follower is to track the leader and maintain a desired
distance between them with desired incidence and bearing angles. We start with
the follower’s translational part, which can be rewritten from the dynamic model
(39) as:
¨pF = f(pF ) + g(pF )fF
(59)
where fF is the total thrust control input and
f(pF ) =

with
 uFx = 2 (qF1qF3 + qF0qF2)
uFy = 2 (qF2qF3 −qF0qF1)
Then the position tracking error between the leader and the follower can be
calculated as

and its derivative
˙˜pF = ˙pFd −˙pF = ˙pFd −vF
(61)
where vF is a virtual control, and its desirable value can be described as:
vd
F = ˙pFd + bF ˜pF + kF ¯pF
(62)

The Quaternions with an Application of Quadrotors Team Formation 179
where bF and kF are two positive matrices, ¯pF =
R ˜pF dt is the integral of the
follower position error and added to minimize the steady-state error.
Now, consider the linear velocity error between the leader and the follower
as:
˜vF = vd
F −˙pF
(63)
By substituting (62) into (63) we obtain:
˜vF = ˙pFd + bF ˜pF + kF ¯pF −˙pF
(64)
and its time derivative
˙˜vF = ¨pFd + bF ˙˜pF + kF ˜pF −¨pF
(65)
Then from (62) and (63) we can rewrite (61) in terms of linear velocity error as:
˙˜pF = ˜vF −bF ˜pF −kF ¯pF
(66)
By substituting (59) and (66) into (65), the time derivative of linear velocity
error can be rewritten as:
˙˜vF =¨pFd + bF ˜vF −b2
F ˙˜pF −bF kF ¯pF + kF ˜pF −f(pF ) −g(pF )fF
(67)
The desirable time derivative of the linear velocity error is supposed to be:
˙˜vF = −cF ˜vF −˜pF
(68)
where cF is a positive diagonal matrix. Now, the total thrust fF , the longitudinal
uFx and lateral uFy motion control can be found by subtracting (67) from (68)
as follows:
fF =(g + ˙vLz + (1 −b2
F z + kF z)˜zF + (bF z + cF z)˜vF z −bF zkF z¯zF −d(R31 cos ρ cos σ

For the attitude stability, a nonlinear controller from [39] is used.
τF = KFq˜qF + KFω ˜ωF + G(˜ωF )
The attitude stability for the follower was demonstrated in [39] . Next, we show
the stability of follower’s translational part.
5.2.
Stability Analysis for Follower
The following candidate Lyapunov function is chosen for the stability analysis
of follower’s translational part with the integral backstepping controller:
V = 1
2(˜pT
F ˜pF + ˜vT
F ˜vF + kF ¯pT
F ¯pF )
(72)
and its time derivative
˙V = ˜pT
F ˙˜pF + ˜vT
F ˙˜vF + kF ¯pT
F ˙¯pF
(73)
By substituting ˙¯pF = ˜pF , and equations (66) and (68) into (73), equation (73)
becomes:
˙V = −bF ˜pT
F ˜pF −cF ˜vT
F ˜vF ≤0
(74)
Finally, (74) is less than zero provided bF and cF are positive diagonal ma-
trices, i.e. ˙V < 0, ∀(˜pF , ˜vF ) ̸= 0 and ˙V (0) = 0. It can be concluded from the
positive deﬁnition of V and applying LaSalle theorem that a global asymptotic
stability is guaranteed. This leads to the conclude that limt→∞˜pF = 0 and
limt→∞˜vF = 0, which meets the position condition of (40).
5.3.
Leader Integral Backstepping Controller
The leader is to track a desired trajectory pLd. Its integral backstepping con-
troller was developed in [39]. The result is that the total force and horizontal
position control laws fL, uLx and uLy can be written as
fL = (¨zLd + g + (1 −bLz2 + kLz)˜zL + (bLz + cLz)˜vLz −bLzkLz¯zL)

And the torque vector applied to the leader quadrotor τL ∈R3 is designed
as
τL = KLq˜qL + KLω ˜ωL + G(˜ωL)
6.
Formation iLQR Controllers
The controller design for the leader and the follower is based on iLQR optimal
control algorithm. The follower iLQR controller is designed by following the
introduction of an error state model. Then the leader iLQR controller is brieﬂy
presented later.
6.1.
iLQR Optimal Control Approach
iLQR is one of the optimal control strategies that is formulated to obtain the
control signals that minimises a performance criterion to satisfy the physical
model constraints. The iLQR strategy is utilised based on LQR technique to
design the full state quadrotor’s controller. Linearising the nonlinear dynamic
model (39), we obtain
xik+1 = f(xik, uik)
(78)
with a quadratic cost function of the form

where xi = [xi, ˙xi, yi, ˙yi, zi, ˙zi, qi0, qi1, qi2, qi3, ωix, ωiy, ωiz]T and the quadro-
tor is controlled by its altitude force fi and attitude torque vector τi. The control
vector can be deﬁned as ui = [fi, τiq1, τiq2, τiq3]T . We will not use the notation
i in the coming equations for simplicity.
The proposed strategy starts with initial control signals k = 0, and the lin-
earised nonlinear system around the control signal uk and state xk, then solves
the LQR problem. Then these steps are repeated (iterated) until a good perfor-
mance is achieved. Let the deviations from uk and xk be δuk and δxk respec-
tively. The linearisation model is
δxk+1 = Akδxk + Bkδuk
(80)
Where the matrices Ak = Jxf(xk, uk) and Bk = Juf(xk, uk) are denoted
by the Jacobians. These are evaluated along xk and uk respectively. Based on
the linear model (80), the cost function (79) can be written as:
J =1
2(xN + δxN −x∗)T QN(xN + δxN −x∗)
+ 1
2
N−1
X
k=0
((xk + δx)T Q(xk + δx)
+ (uk + δu)T R(uk + δu)).
(81)
Adding a constraint to the cost function (81), the value function is
V =1
2(xN + δxN −x∗)T QN(xN + δxN −x∗)
+ 1
2
N−1

k=0
((xk + δx)T Q(xk + δx) + (uk + δu)T
R(uk + δu) + δλT
k+1(Akδxk + Bkδuk −δxk+1)).
(82)
The following Hamiltonian function is a ﬁrst step to proceed towards the optimal
control
Hk =(xk + δxk)T Q(xk + δxk) + (uk + δuk)T R(uk + δuk)
+ δλT
k+1(Akδxk + Bkδuk)

(84)
0 = R(uk + δuk) + BT
k δλk+1
(85)
δλN = Qf(xN + δxN −x∗).
(86)
Based on the boundary condition (86), δλk is assumed to be
δλk = Skδxk + νk
(87)
for some unknown sequences Sk and νk. The boundary conditions for Sk and
νk are
 SN = QN
νN = QN(xN −x∗)
(88)
and from the boundary condition (85), δuk is obtained as:
δuk = −R−1BT
k δλk+1 −uk.
(89)
By solving equations (80), (85) and (87), we obtain
δuk = −Kδxk −Kννk+1 −Kuuk
(90)
where
K = (BT

νk = (Ak −BkK)T νk+1 −KT Ruk + Qxk
(95)
where the gains K and Ku are built on the Riccati equation while the gain Kν
is reliant on auxiliary sequence (95).
The entire sequences of Sk and νk can be solved by the backward recursion
(94) and (95) respectively, with the ﬁnal state weighting matrix boundary con-
dition SN stated in the cost function (81). The control law 90 includes three
terms. The gains of the ﬁrst and the third terms depend on the solution of Ric-
cati equation, while the second term gain depends on the auxiliary sequence νk.
In the ﬁrst term, δxk represents the error between the actual quadrotor state and
the desired state, and in the third term, uk represents the nominal control ac-
tion. Once the modiﬁed LQR problem is solved, an improved nominal control
sequence can be obtained: u∗
k = uk + δuk, where uk is the nominal control
and u∗
k is the improved control. Then the total control laws are concluded as

The proposed H∞, IBS and iLQR controllers were tested in a MATLAB simu-
lator of two quadrotors, one leader and one follower. The quadrotor parameters
used in the simulation are described in Table 1. Same path was presented in
the simulation to show the performance of using the proposed three controllers.
The desired path to be tracked by the leader was

The obtained results are shown in Figures 3 - 6 with the conditions (1) no

dvix = 2Nm at 20 ≤t ≥20.25 seconds, dviy = 2Nm at 30 ≤t ≥30.25
seconds and the attitude part for the leader and the follower is disturbed using

uncertainty. The above conditions were applied for the leader and the follower
at the same time.
Figure 3 shows the formation trajectories of two quadrotors obtained using
the H∞controllers when they tracked the desired path. From this ﬁgure we can
see that the H∞controllers produced good formation performances with small
acceptable errors, fast rejection of the external disturbances, and quick recovery
of the model parameter uncertainties. The quaternions of the leader and the
follower are shown in Figures 4 and 5 with small oscillations. The distances
between the leader and the follower for are shown in Figure 6. Again, less
oscillation in disturbance rejection was observed from the result.

30 ≤t ≥30.25 seconds, and the leader attitude part is disturbed using (97).
It is clear that the follower tracked the leader and maintained the distance
with very small errors in all circumstances.

IBS Controller
The IBS controllers were tested in simulation to track a desired path
by the leader and maintain the desired distance, desired incidence angle
and desired bearing angle between them for the follower.

ters chosen were bL = diag(180, 0.34, 0.34), cL = diag(0.7, 0.02, 0.02),

Figure 8 shows the formation trajectories of two quadrotors obtained by
using the IBS controller. From this ﬁgure we can see that the IBS controller
performed with high error, large oscillation in disturbance rejection and model
parameter uncertainty recovery.
The quaternions of the leader and the follower are shown in Figures 9 and
10, respectively. High oscillation is observed in these two ﬁgures. The dis-
tances between the leader and the follower are shown in Figure 11. Again, high
oscillation can be observed from the result of this ﬁgure.
Figure 12 shows the performance using the IBS controller when only the
leader was affected by force disturbance dvLz = −4Nm during 10 ≤t ≥10.25
seconds, dvLx = 4Nm during 20 ≤t ≥20.25 seconds, dvLy = 4Nm during
30 ≤t ≥30.25 seconds, and the attitude part is disturbance using (97).
It is clear that the follower tracked the leader and maintained the distance
with high error and oscillation in all circumstances.

To validate the iLQR control strategy, it was tested in the simulation of two
quadrotors in the leader-follower formation problem. The desired path was also
used to test the LQR control for comparison purposes.
Figure 13 shows the response of the leader while tracking the predeﬁned
path and the follower maintaining the desired distance, the bearing angle and
the incidence angle. The quaternion components responses of the leader and

The error in using the iLQR controller was smaller than that in using LQR.
However, when the iLQR controller ran for ﬁve iterations, the response was
slightly improved.
In conclusion, it is obvious that the proposed iLQR controller maintained
the distance between the leader and the follower faster than LQR controller.
Conclusion
This chapter has presented the performance of applying the H∞, IBS and iLQR
controllers to the leader-follower formation control problem of quadrotors when
its dynamic model was derived based on unit quaternion. The H∞controller
was developed to reject the external disturbances and recover the model param-
eter uncertainties change. Then, its stability and robustness were analysed and
a set of corresponding conditions were given.
The IBS controller was developed based on BS control theory with adding
an integral action to minimise the steady state error which appeared when the BS
controller was used for leader-follower formation problem. The main drawback
of the IBS controller is that its stability is guaranteed but the performance is not,

and it has three coupling parameters to be tuned compared with a guaranteed
stability and performance of the H∞controller. Another noteworthy drawback
of the IBS controller that was noticed in the current study is the considerable
overshoot in its response due to the effect of the integral parameter and high
oscillations when external disturbances were applied to the system dynamics in
leader-follower formation.
The iLQR controller is essentially based on the LQR controller with an iter-
ation technique. It has a set of gains equal to the number of operating samples
by linearising the system in each sample of operation.
The controllers were tested in the MATLAB simulater. The simulation re-
sults show that the proposed H∞controller achieved excellent performance
compared with those of IBS controller.
The proposed iLQR controller was based on ﬁnding a linearised system at
each time step of the operation, while the LQR controller was based on obtain-
ing a linearised system at the operating point (hovering point). The solutions
of the two controllers establish the potential of the proposed iLQR law by im-
proving the tracking accuracy and the speed of catching the desired path and
maintaining the distances between the leader and the follower compared with
the LQR controller. The iLQR controller performed better than the LQR con-
troller, especially in quaternion components performance.
As a result, the proposed H∞controller indeed produced better control per-
formance than the IBS controller in all circumstances, and the iLQR controller
perform faster than LQR controller with less errors.

Abstract
A generalized inverse of a given quaternion matrix (similarly, as for
complex matrices) exists for a larger class of matrices than the invertible
matrices. It has some of the properties of the usual inverse, and agrees
with the inverse when a given matrix happens to be invertible. There

exist many different generalized inverses. In this chapter, we consider
determinantal representations of the Drazin and weighted Drazin inverses
over the quaternion skew ﬁeld.
Due to the theory of column-row determinants recently introduced by
the author, we derive determinantal representations of the Drazin inverse
for both Hermitian and arbitrary matrices over the quaternion skew ﬁeld.
Using obtained determinantal representations of the Drazin inverse we get
explicit representation formulas (analogs of Cramer’s rule) for the Drazin
inverse solutions of the quaternionic matrix equations AXB = D and,
consequently, AX = D, XB = D in both cases when A and B are
Hermitian and arbitrary, where A, B can be noninvertible matrices of
appropriate sizes. We obtain determinantal representations of solutions
of the differential quaternionic matrix equations, X′ + AX = B and
X′ + XA = B, where A is noninvertible as well.
Also, we obtain new determinantal representations of the W-weighted
Drazin inverse over the quaternion skew ﬁeld. We give determinantal
representations of the W-weighted Drazin inverse by using previously
obtained determinantal representations of the Drazin inverse, the Moore-
Penrose inverse, and the limit representations of the W-weighted Drazin
inverse in some special case. Using these determinantal representations
of the W-weighted Drazin inverse, we derive explicit formulas for deter-
minantal representations of the W-weighted Drazin inverse solutions of
the quaternionic matrix equations WAWX = D, XWAW = D, and
W1AW1XW2BW2 = D.

Introduction
Let R and C be the real and complex number ﬁelds, respectively. Throughout
the paper, we denote the set of all m × n matrices over the quaternion algebra
H = {a0 + a1i + a2j + a3k | i2 = j2 = k2 = −1, a0, a1, a2, a3 ∈R}
by Hm×n, and by Hm×n
r
the set of all m × n matrices over H with a rank r.
Let M (n, H) be the ring of n × n quaternion matrices and I be the identity
matrix with the appropriate size. For A ∈Hn×m, we denote by A∗, rank A the
conjugate transpose (Hermitian adjoint) matrix and the rank of A. The matrix
A = (aij) ∈Hn×n is Hermitian if A∗= A.
The deﬁnitions of the generalized inverse matrices can be extended to
quaternion matrices as follows.

Drazin and W-Weighted Drazin Inverses Over the Quaternion ...
203
Deﬁnition 1.1. The Moore-Penrose inverse of A ∈Hm×n, denoted by A†, is
the unique matrix X ∈Hn×m satisfying the following equations,
AXA = A;
(1.1)
XAX = X;
(1.2)
(AX)∗= AX;
(1.3)
(XA)∗= XA.
(1.4)
Deﬁnition 1.2. For A ∈Hn×n with k = Ind A the smallest positive number
such that rank Ak+1 = rank Ak, the Drazin inverse of A is deﬁned to be the
unique matrix X that satisfying (1..2) and the following equations,
AX = XA;
(1.5)
Ak+1X = Ak.
(1.6)
It is denoted by X = AD. In particular, when IndA = 1, then the matrix X is
called the group inverse and is denoted by X = Ag.
If IndA = 0, then A is invertible, and AD ≡A† = A−1.
Cline and Greville [1] extended the Drazin inverse of a square matrix to
a rectangular matrix, which can be generalized to the quaternion algebra as
follows.
Deﬁnition 1.3. For A ∈Hm×n and W ∈Hn×m, the W-weighted Drazin
inverse of A with respect to W is the unique solution to equations,
(AW)k+1XW = (AW)k;
(1.7)
XWAWX = X;
(1.8)
AWX = XWA,
(1.9)
where k = max{Ind(AW), Ind(WA)}. It is denoted by X = Ad,W.
The problem of determinantal representation of generalized inverse matri-
ces only recently begun to be decided through the theory of column-row de-
terminants introduced in [2, 3]. The theory of row and column determinants
develops the classical approach to a deﬁnition of a determinant as an alternat-
ing sum of products of elements of a quadratic matrix but with a predetermined

204
Ivan Kyrchei
order of factors in each summand of a determinant. A determinant of a ma-
trix with noncommutative elements is often called the noncommutative deter-
minant. Unlike other known noncommutative determinants such as determi-
nants of Dieudonn´e [4], Study [5], Moore [6,7], Chen [8], quasideterminants of
Gelfand-Retakh [9], the double determinant built on the theory of the column-
row determinants has properties similar to the usual determinant, in particular,
it can be expand along arbitrary rows and columns. This property is neces-
sary for determinantal representations of the inverse and generalized inverse
matrices. Determinantal representations of the Moore-Penrose inverse, the min-
imum norm least squares solutions of some quaternion matrix equations over
the quaternion skew-ﬁeld have been obtained in [10,11]. Determinantal repre-
sentations of an outer inverse A(2)
T,S has introduced in [12,13] using column-row
determinants as well. Recall that an outer inverse of a matrix A over complex
ﬁeld with prescribed range space T and null space S is a solution of (1..2) with
restrictions,
R(X) = T, N(X) = S.
Within the framework of the theory of column-row determinants Song [14] also
has gave a determinantal representation of the W-weighted Drazin inverse over
the quaternion skew-ﬁeld using its characterization by an outer inverse A(2)
T,S.
But, in obtaining of this determinantal representation, auxiliary matrices that
different from A or its powers are needed. In this chapter, we shall obtain
new determinantal representations of the Drazin inverse and the W-weighted
Drazin inverse of A ∈Hm×n with respect to W ∈Hn×m by using only
their entries. These determinantal representations of the Drazin and W-weighted
Drazin inverse will be used for explicit determinantal representation formulas of
the Drazin and W-weighted Drazin inverse solutions of some quaternion matrix
equations.
The chapter is organized as follows. We start with some basic concepts and
results from the theory of row-column determinants and the theory of quater-
nion matrices in Section 2. In Section 3, we give the determinantal representa-
tions of the Drazin inverse of a Hermitian quaternion matrix in Subsection 3.1
and an arbitrary quaternion matrix in Subsection 3.2. In Section 4, we obtain
explicit representation formulas for the Drazin inverse solutions of quaternion
matrix equations AXB = D and, consequently, AX = D, and XB = D.
In Subsection 4.1, we consider the case when A, B are Hermitian, and they
are arbitrary in Subsection 4.1. In Section 4.3, we show numerical examples to

Drazin and W-Weighted Drazin Inverses Over the Quaternion ...
205
illustrate the main results. In Section 5, we apply the obtained determinantal
representations of the Drazin inverse to solutions of differential matrix equa-
tions. In Subsection 5.1, we give a background for quaternion-valued differ-
ential equations. In Subsection 5.2, determinantal representations of solutions
of the differential matrix equations, X′ + AX = B and X′ + XA = B are
derived, where A ∈Hn×n is noninvertible. It is demonstrated in an exam-
ple in Subsection 5.3. In Section 6, we obtain determinantal representations of
the W-weighted Drazin inverse by using introduced above determinantal repre-
sentations of the Drazin inverse in Subsection 6.1, the Moore-Penrose inverse
in Subsection 6.2, and the limit representations of the W-weighted Drazin in-
verse in some special case in Subsection 6.3. In Subsection 6.4, we show a
numerical example to illustrate the main result. By using determinantal repre-
sentations of the W-weighted Drazin inverse obtained in the previous section,
we get explicit formulas for determinantal representations of the W-weighted
Drazin inverse solutions (analogs of Cramer’s rule) of some quaternion ma-
trix equations in Section 7. In Subsection 7.1, we consider the background of
the problem of Cramer’s rule for the W-weighted Drazin inverse solution. In
Subsection 7.2, we obtain explicit representation formulas of the W-weighted
Drazin inverse solutions (analogs of Cramer’s rule) of the quaternion matrix
equations WAWX = D, XWAW = D, and W1AW1XW2BW2 = D. In
Subsection 7.3, we give numerical examples to illustrate the main result.

Preliminaries. Elements of the Theory of the Column
and Row Determinants
Suppose Sn is the symmetric group on the set In = {1, . . ., n}. Through the
chapter, we denote i = 1, . . ., n by i = 1, n.
Deﬁnition 2.1. The i-th row determinant of A = (aij) ∈M (n, H) is deﬁned

206

for all i = 1, n by putting
rdetiA =
X
σ∈Sn
(−1)n−r (aiik1aik1ik1+1 . . .aik1+l1i) . . .(aikr ikr+1 . . .aikr+lr ikr ),
σ = (i ik1ik1+1 . . .ik1+l1) (ik2ik2+1 . . .ik2+l2) . . .(ikrikr+1 . . .ikr+lr) ,
with conditions ik2 < ik3 < . . . < ikr and ikt < ikt+s for t = 2, r and s = 1, lt.
Deﬁnition 2.2. The j-th column determinant of A = (aij) ∈M (n, H) is de-
ﬁned for all j = 1, n by putting
cdetj A =
X
τ∈Sn
(−1)n−r (ajkr jkr+lr . . .ajkr+1ikr ) . . .(aj jk1+l1 . . .ajk1+1jk1ajk1j),
τ = (jkr+lr . . .jkr+1jkr) . . .(jk2+l2 . . .jk2+1jk2) (jk1+l1 . . .jk1+1jk1j) ,
with conditions, jk2 < jk3 < . . . < jkr and jkt < jkt+s for t = 2, r and
s = 1, lt.
Suppose Aij denotes the submatrix of A obtained by deleting both the i-th
row and the j-th column. Let a.j be the j-th column and ai. be the i-th row of
A. Suppose A.j (b) denotes the matrix obtained from A by replacing its j-th
column with the column-vector b, and Ai. (b) denotes the matrix obtained from
A by replacing its i-th row with the row-vector b.
We note some properties of column and row determinants of a quaternion
matrix A = (aij), where i ∈In, j ∈Jn and In = Jn = {1, . . ., n}. These
properties completely have been proved in [2,3].
Proposition 2.1. If b ∈H, then rdetiAi. (b · ai.) = b · rdetiA for all i = 1, n.
Proposition 2.2. If b ∈H, then cdetj A.j (a.j · b) = cdetj A·b for all j = 1, n.
Proposition 2.3. If for A ∈M (n, H) there exists t ∈In such that atj = bj+cj
for all j = 1, n, then
rdeti A = rdeti At. (b) + rdeti At. (c) ,
cdeti A = cdeti At. (b) + cdeti At. (c) ,
where b = (b1, . . ., bn) ∈H1×n, c = (c1, . . ., cn) ∈H1×n, i = 1, n.

207
Proposition 2.4. If for A ∈M (n, H) there exists t ∈Jn such that ai t = bi+ci
for all i = 1, n, then
rdetj A = rdetj A . t (b) + rdetj A . t (c) ,
cdetj A = cdetj A . t (b) + cdetjA . t (c) ,
where b = (b1, . . ., bn)T ∈Hn×1, c = (c1, . . ., cn)T ∈Hn×1, j = 1, n.
Proposition 2.5. If A∗is the Hermitian adjoint matrix of A ∈M (n, H), then
rdeti A∗= cdeti A for all i = 1, n.
The following lemmas enable us to expand rdeti A by cofactors along the
i-th row and cdetjA along the j-th column respectively for all i, j = 1, n.
Lemma 2.3. Let Rij be the ij-th right cofactor of A ∈M (n, H), that is,
rdeti A =
nP
j=1
aij · Rij for all i = 1, n. Then
Rij =

if
i > j;

if
i < j;
rdetk Aii,
i = j,
k = min {In \ i},
(2.1)
where Aii
.j (a.i) is obtained from A by replacing the j-th column with the i-th
column, and then by deleting both the i-th row and column.
Lemma 2.4. Let Lij be the ij-th left cofactor of A ∈M (n, H), that is,
cdetj A =
nP
i=1
Lij · aij for all j = 1, n. Then
Lij =



−cdetk Ajj

i ̸= j,
k =

if
j > i;
i −1,
if
j < i;
cdetk Aii,
i = j,
k = min{Jn \ j},
(2.2)
where Ajj
i. (aj .) is obtained from A by replacing the i-th row with the j-th row,
and then by deleting both the j-th row and column.
The following theorem has a key value in the theory of column-row deter-
minants.
Theorem 2.5. If A ∈M (n, H) is Hermitian, then rdet1A = · · · = rdetnA =
cdet1A = · · · = cdetnA ∈R.

Remark 2.6. Since all column and row determinants of a Hermitian matrix
over H are equal, we can deﬁne the determinant of Hermitian A ∈M (n, H) by
putting for all i = 1, n,
det A := rdeti A = cdeti A.
Properties of the determinant of a Hermitian matrix is completely explored
in [3] by its row and column determinants. They can be summarized by the
following theorems.
Theorem 2.7. If the i-th row of a Hermitian matrix A ∈M (n, H) is replaced
with a left linear combination of its other rows, i.e. ai. = c1ai1. + . . . + ckaik.,
where cl ∈H for all l = 1, k and i, il ∈In, then
rdeti Ai . (c1ai1. + . . . + ckaik.) = cdeti Ai . (c1ai1. + . . . + ckaik.) = 0.
Theorem 2.8. If the j-th column of a Hermitian matrix A ∈M (n, H) is
replaced with a right linear combination of its other columns, i.e.
a.j =
a.j1c1 + . . . + a.jkck, where cl ∈H for all l = 1, k and j, jl ∈Jn, then
cdetj A.j (a.j1c1 + . . . + a.jkck) = rdetj A.j (a.j1c1 + . . . + a.jkck) = 0.
The following theorem on determinantal representations of an inverse ma-
trix of Hermitian follows directly from these properties.
Theorem 2.9. If A ∈M (n, H) is Hermitian, and det A ̸= 0, then there exists
a unique right inverse matrix (RA)−1 and a unique left inverse matrix (LA)−1
of A, where (RA)−1 = (LA)−1 =: A−1, and they possess the following
determinantal representations, respectively,
(RA)−1 =

Remark 2.10. If det A = 0, we say that a Hermitian quaternion matrix A ∈
M (n, H) is singular because, in this case, A is noninvertible.
Since principal submatrices of a Hermitian matrix are Hermitian, the prin-
cipal minor can be deﬁned as the determinant of its principal submatrix by anal-
ogy to the commutative case. In [3], we have introduced the rank by principle
minors that is the maximal order of a nonzero principal minor of a Hermitian
matrix. The following theorem determines a relationship between it and the col-
umn rank of a matrix deﬁning as ceiling amount of right-linearly independent
columns, and the row rank deﬁning as ceiling amount of left-linearly indepen-
dent rows.
Theorem 2.11. If A ∈M (n, H) is Hermitian, then its rank by principal minors
are equal to its column and row ranks.
Due to the non-commutativity of quaternions, there are two types of eigen-
values. A quaternion λ is said to be a right eigenvalue of A ∈M (n, H) if
A · x = x · λ, and λ is a left eigenvalue if A · x = λ · x for some nonzero
quaternion column-vector x ∈Hn.
The theory on the left eigenvalues of quaternion matrices has been investi-
gated, in particular, in [18,19,20]. The theory on the right eigenvalues of quater-
nion matrices is more developed. In particular, we note [21,23,24,25,26,27].
Proposition 2.6. [25] Let A ∈M (n, H) be Hermitian. Then A has exactly n
real right eigenvalues.
Right and left eigenvalues are in general unrelated [27] but it is not for Her-
mitian matrices. Suppose A ∈M (n, H) is Hermitian and λ ∈R is its right
eigenvalue, then A · x = x · λ = λ · x. This means that all right eigenvalues
of a Hermitian matrix are its left eigenvalues as well. For real left eigenvalues,
λ ∈R, the matrix λI −A is Hermitian.
Deﬁnition 2.12. If λ ∈R, then for a Hermitian matrix A the polynomial
pA (λ) = det (λI −A) is said to be the characteristic polynomial of A.
The roots of the characteristic polynomial of a Hermitian matrix are its real
left eigenvalues which are its right eigenvalues as well. We can prove the fol-
lowing theorem by analogy to the commutative case (see, e.g. [28]).
Theorem 2.13. If A ∈M (n, H) is Hermitian, then pA (λ) = λn −d1λn−1 +
d2λn−2 −. . .+(−1)n dn, where dk is the sum of principle minors of A of order
k, 1 ≤k < n, and dn = det A.

Determinantal Representations of the Drazin Inverse
As one of the important types of generalized inverses of matrices, the Drazin
inverses and their applications have well been examined in the literature (see,
e.g., [29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34]). In [35], Stanimirovi`c and Djordjevi´c have intro-
duced a determinantal representation of the Drazin inverse of a complex matrix
based on its full-rank representation. In [36], we obtain determinantal represen-
tations of the Drazin inverse of a complex matrix used its limit representation. It
allowed to obtain the analogs of Cramer’s rule for the Drazin inverse solutions
of some matrix equations. In this chapter we extend studies conducted in [36]
from the complex ﬁeld to the quaternion skew ﬁeld.

Analogues of the Classical Adjoint Matrix for the Drazin
Inverse of a Hermitian Matrix
For Hermitian matrices, we apply the method which consists of the theorem
on the limit representation of the Drazin inverse, lemmas on rank of matrices
and on characteristic polynomial. This method at ﬁrst has been used in [36],
afterwards in [37, 38]. By analogy to [39] the following theorem on the limit
representation of the quaternion Drazin inverse can be proved.

By Aα
β denote the submatrix of A determined
by rows indexed by α and columns indexed by β.
Then Aα
α denotes the
principal submatrix determined by the rows and columns indexed by α.
If
A ∈M (n, H) is Hermitian, then by |Aα
α| denote the corresponding prin-

For 1 ≤k ≤n, the collection of strictly increas-

let Ir, m{i} := { α : α ∈Lr,m, i ∈α},
Jr, n{j} := { β : β ∈Lr,n, j ∈β}.

Determinantal Representations of the Drazin Inverse for an
Arbitrary Matrix
For an arbitrary matrix A ∈M (n, H) with IndA = k and rank Ak+1 =
rank Ak = r, we can not apply the method proposed for Hermitian matrices
primarily because the lemma on the characteristic polynomial for an arbitrary
quaternion matrix is not possible in general. We shall use a basic equality on the
Drazin inverse and determinantal representations of the Moore-Penrose inverse
by the following proposition and theorem, respectively.
Proposition 3.1. [30] If Ind(A) = k, then
AD = Ak(A2k+1)+Ak.

Cramer’s Rule of the Drazin Inverse Solutions of
Some Matrix Equations
One of the main applications of the determinantal representation of an inverse
matrix by the classical adjoint matrix is the Cramer rule. In this section we shall
show that the obtained determinantal representations give the exact analogues
of Cramer’s rule for the Drazin inverse solutions of some matrix equations.
For an arbitrary matrix over the quaternion skew ﬁeld, A ∈Hm×n, we
denote by
• Rr(A) = {y ∈Hm : y = Ax, x ∈Hn}, the column right space of A,
• Nr(A) = {y ∈Hn : Ax = 0}, the right null space of A,
• Rl(A) = {y ∈Hn : y = xA, x ∈Hm}, the column left space of A,
• Nr(A) = {y ∈Hm : xA = 0}, the left null space of A.

222
Ivan Kyrchei
Consider a matrix equation
AXB = D,
(4.1)
where A ∈Hn×n, B ∈Hm×m, D ∈Hn×m are given, and X ∈Hn×m is
unknown. Let IndA = k1 and IndB = k2.
It’s well known (see, e.g., [12]) that the equation (4.1) with restrictions
Rr(X) ⊂Rr(Ak1), Nr(X) ⊃Nr(Bk2),
Rl(X) ⊂Rl(Ak1), Nl(X) ⊃Nl(Bk2),
has a unique solution X = ADDBD.

Applications of the Determinantal Representations
of the Drazin Inverse to Some Differential Matrix
Equations
In [40], applications of the Drazin inverse to linear systems of differential equa-
tions with singular constant coefﬁcients have been done. In [41], we recently
have obtained determinantal representations of solutions of some singular dif-
ferential complex-valued matrix equations. In this chapter we extend studies
conducted in [41] from the complex ﬁeld to the quaternion skew ﬁeld.
5 1.
Background for Quaternion-valued Differential Equations
(QDE)
Consider a quaternion-valued function of real variable, f : R →H, (t ∈R
is a real variable), such that f(t) = f0(t) + f1(t)i + f2(t)j + f3(t)k. The
ﬁrst derivative of a quaternionic function f(t) with respect to the real variable t
denote by,
f ′(t) := df(t)
dt
= df0(t)
dt
+ df1(t)
dt
i + df2(t)
dt
j + df3(t)
dt
k.
It is easy to prove the following proposition on properties of the derivative
of quaternionic functions.
Proposition 5.1. If q : R →H and r : R →H are differentiable, then (q ±
r)(t), qr(t) and, for any integer n ≥1, qn are differentiable, and
(q ± r)′(t) = q′(t) ± r′(t),
(5.1)
(qr)′(t) = q′(t)r(t) + q(t)r′(t),
(5.2)
[qn(t)]′ =
n−1
X
j=0
qj(t)q′(t)qn−j(t).
(5.3)
If fi(t) for all l = 0, 3 is integrable on [a, b] ⊂R, the f(t) is integrable and

Consider a matrix valued function A(t) = (aij(t)) ∈Hn×n ⊗R, where aij(t)

We need the exponential of q ∈H that can be deﬁned by putting,
exp q =
∝
X
n=0
qn
n! .
(5.4)
From the deﬁnition of a quaternionic exponential (5.4), we evidently have the
following properties.
Proposition 5.2. If q, r ∈H are such that qr = rq, then exp (q + r) =
(exp q)(expr).
Proposition 5.3. If q : R →H is differentiable and q′(t)q(t) = q(t)q′(t),
then
[exp q(t)]′ = [exp q(t)] q′(t).
In [42], the linear quaternion differential equations,
q′(t) = a(t)q(t),
(5.5)
and
q′(t) = q(t)a(t),
(5.6)
with the initial condition q(t0) = q0 have been considered and the following
proposition has been derived.
Proposition 5.4. Let q(t) = Φl(t)q0 and q(t) = q0Φr(t) be solutions of (5.5)
and (5.6), respectively. If
a(t)

If a is constant, then, evidently,
R t
t0 a(τ)dt = a (t −t0), and Φl(t) =
Φr(t) = exp(a (t −t0)).
The similar result has been obtained in [43] as well. In [43], the following
nonhomogeneous differential equation corresponding to (5.5) has been consid-
ered,
q′(t) = a(t)q(t) + f(t),
(5.8)
where f : [0, T] →H and a : [0, T] →H. It has been shown, if condition (5.7)
is satisﬁed, then the solutions of (5.8) are given by
q(t) = exp
„Z t

«
, (t ∈[0, T]).
(5.9)
In the special case when a is constant and q(0) = 1, then the solutions of (5.8)
are given by
q(t) = exp (at)

exp (−as) f(s)ds

5 2. Determinantal Representations of Solutions of Some Singular
Differential Quaternion-Matrix Equations
Consider the matrix differential equation
X′ + AX = B,
(5.11)
where A ∈Hn×n, B ∈Hn×n are given, X ∈Hn×n is unknown. By (5.10) the
general solution of (5.11) is found to be
X(t) = exp (−At)
Z
exp (At) dt

B.
If A is invertible, then
Z
exp (At) dt = A−1 exp (At) + G,
(5.12)
where G is an arbitrary n × n quaternionic matrix.
Since A−1 exp (A) = exp (A)A−1, then the general solution of (5.11) is
X(t) = {A−1 + exp (−At) G}B. If A is noninvertible, then due to [30] the
following theorem can be expended to quaternion matrices.

Proof. Differentiate the right-hand side of (5.13), and use the series expansion
for exp (At).
Using (5.13) and the series expansion for exp (−At), we get an explicit
form for a general solution of (5.11),

2. The proof of (5.16) is similar to the proof of (5.15) by using the determi-

Consider the matrix differential equation

If A is invertible, then by (5.12) the general solution of (5.17) is X(t) =

Determinantal Representations of the W-Weighted
Drazin Inverse for an Arbitrary Matrix
The properties of the complex W-weighted Drazin inverse can be found in [1,44,
45,46,47,48]. These properties can be generalized to H. In particular, if A ∈
Hm×n with respect to W ∈Hn×m and k = max{Ind(AW), Ind(WA)},
then

(6.2)
Determinantal representations W-weighted Drazin inverse of complex matrices
have been received by a full-rank factorization in [37] and by a limit represen-
tation in [49].
Through the theory of column-row determinants, a determinantal represen-
tation W-weighted Drazin inverse over the quaternion skew-ﬁeld for the ﬁrst
time has been obtained in [14] by the following theorem.

As can be seen, the auxiliary matrices B and C have been used in the de-
terminantal representations (6.3) and (6.4). In this chapter we escape it. We
shall derive determinantal representations of the W-weighted Drazin inverse of
an arbitrary matrix A ∈Hm×n with respect to W ∈Hn×m by using the de-
terminantal representations of the Drazin inverse, of the Moore-Penrose inverse,
and the limit representation of the W-weighted Drazin inverse in some particular
case.

Let A ∈Hm×n and W ∈Hn×m. Denote WA =: U = (uij) ∈Hn×n and
AW =: V = (vij) ∈Hm×m. Due to Theorem 3.6 for an arbitrary element of
the Drazin inverse UD, we have the following determinantal representations,

6 2. Determinantal Representations of the W-Weighted Drazin

Consider the general algebraic structures (GAS) of the matrices A ∈Hm×n,
W ∈Hn×m, A+ ∈Hn×m, W+ ∈Hm×n and Ad,W ∈Hm×n with k =
max{Ind(AW), Ind(WA)} (e.g., [44,45,46,47]).

6 3. Determinantal Representations of the W-Weighted Drazin
Inverse in Some Special Case
In this subsection we consider the determinantal representation of the W-
weighted Drazin inverse of A ∈Hm×n with respect to W ∈Hn×m in a special
case, when AW = V = (vij) ∈Hm×m and WA = U = (uij) ∈Hn×n are
Hermitian. Then, for the determinantal representations of their Drazin inverse
we can use (3.6) and (3.7).
For Hermitian matrix, we apply the method, which consists of the theorem
on the limit representation of the Drazin inverse, lemmas on rank of matrices
and on characteristic polynomial. By analogy to the complex case [39] we have
the following limit representations of the W-weighted Drazin inverse,
Ad,W = lim

tively. Denote by ¯Vk := (AW)kA ∈Hm×n and ¯

matrix with −¯wj s in the (i, s)-entry, 1 in all diagonal entries, and 0 in others.
The matrix Pi s (−¯wj s), (s ̸= i), is a matrix of an elementary transformation.

By substituting (6.28) and (6.29) in (6.27), and equating factors at ¯wl i when

By analogy can be proved the following lemma.
Lemma 6.9. If WA = U = (uij) ∈Hn×n is Hermitian with IndU = k and

Theorem 6.10. If A ∈Hm×n, W ∈Hn×m, and AW ∈Hm×m is Hermitian

We shall prove that c(ij)

Since by Lemma 3.2


of order s ≥r + 1. Deleting both its i-th row
and column, we obtain a principal submatrix of order s −1 of (AW)k+2. We
denote it by M. The following cases are possible.
• Let s = r + 1 and det M ̸= 0. In this case all columns of M are right-
linearly independent. The addition of all of them on one coordinate to
columns of

(AW)k+2

Hence, they are basis in a matrix

column is the right linear combination of its basis columns. From this

Therefore, by Theorem 2.8,

Cramer’s Rule for the W-weighted Drazin Inverse

In [46], Wei has established Cramer’s rule for solving of a general restricted
equation
WAWx = b, x ∈R

(AW)k1i
,
(7.1)
where A ∈Cm×n, W ∈Cn×m with Ind (AW) = k1, Ind (WA) = k2 and
rank (AW)k1 = r1, rank (WA)k2 = r2. He proofed if b ∈R

(W)k2A

and
r1 = r2, then (7.1) has a unique solution, x = Ad,Wb, which can be presented
by the following Cramer rule,
xj = det
WAW(j −→b)
U1
V1(j −→0)

are matrices whose columns form
bases for N((WA)k2) and N((AW)k1), respectively.
Recently, within the framework of the theory of column-row determinants
Song [14] has considered a characterization of the W-weighted Drazin inverse

s2. He proved that if
Rr(D) ∈Rr


and there exist auxiliary matrices of full column rank, L1 ∈Hn×n−s1

, M∗
2 ∈Hp×p−s2

with additionalterms of their ranges
and null spaces, then the restricted matrix equation (7.3) has a unique solution,
X = Ad,W1DBd,W2.
Using auxiliary matrices, L1, M1, L2, M2, Song presented its Cramer’s rule
by analogy to (7.2). In this chapter we avoid such approach and obtain explicit
formulas for determinantal representations of the W-weighted Drazin inverse
solutions of matrix equations by using only given matrices.

Remark 7.2. To establish the Cramer rule of (7.3) we shall not use the de-
terminantal representations (6.30) and (6.30) for (7.5) because corresponding
determinantal representations of it’s solution will be too cumbersome. But they
are suitable in the following corollaries.

Conclusion
In this chapter, we have obtained determinantal representations of the Drazin
and W-weighted Drazin inverses over the quaternion skew ﬁeld. We have de-
rived determinantal representations of the Drazin inverse for both Hermitian and
arbitrary matrices over the quaternion skew ﬁeld by the theory of column-row
determinants recently introduced by the author. Using obtained determinantal
representations of the Drazin inverse we have get explicit representation formu-
las (analogs of Cramer’s rule) for the Drazin inverse solutions of the quater-
nionic matrix equations AXB = D and, consequently, AX = D, XB = D
in both cases when A and B are Hermitian and arbitrary. We also have obtain
determinantal representations of solutions of the differential quaternion-matrix
equations, X′ + AX = B and X′ + XA = B, where A is noninvertible.
Also, we have obtained new determinantal representations of the W-
weighted Drazin inverse over the quaternion skew ﬁeld. We have gave de-

terminantal representations of the W-weighted Drazin inverse by using previ-
ously obtained determinantal representations of the Drazin inverse, the Moore-
Penrose inverse, and the limit representations of the W-weighted Drazin in-
verse in some special case. Using these determinantal representations of the
W-weighted Drazin inverse, explicit formulas for determinantal representations
of the W-weighted Drazin inverse solutions of the quaternionic matrix equa-
tions WAWX = D, XWAW = D, and W1AW1XW2BW2 = D have
been obtained.
