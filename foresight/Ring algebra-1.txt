In mathematics, rings are algebraic structures that generalize fields: multiplication
need not be commutative and multiplicative inverses need not exist. In other words,
a ring is a set equipped with two binary operations satisfying properties analogous to
those of addition and multiplication of integers. Ring elements may be numbers such
as integers or complex numbers, but they may also be non-numerical objects such
as polynomials, square matrices, functions, and power series.

Formally, a ring is an abelian group whose operation is called addition, with a
second binary operation called multiplication that is associative,
is distributive over the addition operation, and has a multiplicative identity element.
(Some authors use the term "ring" to refer to the more general structure that omits this last
requirement; see §°Notes on the definition.)
Whether a ring is commutative (that is, whether the order in which two elements are multiplied
might change the result) has profound implications on its behavior. Commutative
algebra, the theory of commutative rings, is a major branch of ring theory. Its
development has been greatly influenced by problems and ideas of algebraic number
theory and algebraic geometry. The simplest commutative rings are those that admit
division by non-zero elements; such rings are called fields.
Examples of commutative rings include the set of integers with their standard addition and
multiplication, the set of polynomials with their addition and multiplication,
the coordinate ring of an affine algebraic variety, and the ring of integers of a
number field. Examples of noncommutative rings include the ring of n × n real square
matrices with n ≥2, group rings in representation theory, operator
algebras in functional analysis, rings of differential operators, and cohomology
rings in topology.
The conceptualization of rings spanned the 1870s to the 1920s, with key contributions
by Dedekind, Hilbert, Fraenkel, and Noether. Rings were first formalized as a
generalization of Dedekind domains that occur in number theory, and of polynomial
rings and rings of invariants that occur in algebraic geometry and invariant theory.
They later proved useful in other branches of mathematics such
as geometry and analysis.

Definition[edit]
A ring is a set R equipped with two binary operations[a] + (addition)
and ⋅(multiplication) satisfying the following three sets of axioms, called the ring
axioms[1][2][3]
1. R is an abelian group under addition, meaning that:

(a + b) + c = a + (b + c) for all a, b, c in R (that is, + is associative).

a + b = b + a for all a, b in R (that is, + is commutative).

There is an element 0 in R such that a + 0 = a for all a in R (that is, 0 is
the additive identity).

For each a in R there exists −a in R such that a + (−a) = 0 (that is, −a is
the additive inverse of a).
2. R is a monoid under multiplication, meaning that:

(a ⋅b) ⋅c = a ⋅(b ⋅c) for all a, b, c in R (that is, ⋅is
associative).

There is an element 1 in R such that a ⋅1 = a and 1 ⋅a = a for
all a in R (that is, 1 is the multiplicative identity).[b]
3. Multiplication is distributive with respect to addition, meaning that:

a ⋅(b + c) = (a ⋅b) + (a ⋅c) for all a, b, c in R (left distributivity).

(b + c) ⋅a = (b ⋅a) + (c ⋅a) for all a, b, c in R (right distributivity).
Notes on the definition[edit]

In the terminology of this article, a ring is defined to have a multiplicative identity,
and a structure with the same axiomatic definition but for the requirement of a
multiplicative identity is called a rng (IPA: /rʊŋ/). For example, the set of even
integers with the usual + and ⋅is a rng, but not a ring. As explained
in §°History below, many authors apply the term "ring" without requiring a
multiplicative identity.
The multiplication symbol ⋅is usually omitted; for example, xy means x ⋅y.
Although ring addition is commutative, ring multiplication is not required to be
commutative: ab need not necessarily equal ba. Rings that also satisfy
commutativity for multiplication (such as the ring of integers) are called commutative
rings. Books on commutative algebra or algebraic geometry often adopt the
convention that ring means commutative ring, to simplify terminology.
In a ring, multiplicative inverses are not required to exist. A nonzero commutative ring
in which every nonzero element has a multiplicative inverse is called a field.
The additive group of a ring is the underlying set equipped with only the operation of
addition. Although the definition requires that the additive group be abelian, this can
be inferred from the other ring axioms.[4] The proof makes use of the "1", and does not
work in a rng. (For a rng, omitting the axiom of commutativity of addition leaves
it inferrable from the remaining rng assumptions only for elements that are
products: ab + cd = cd + ab.)
Although most modern authors use the term "ring" as defined here, there are a few who use the
term to refer to more general structures in which there is no requirement for multiplication to
be associative.[5] For these others, every algebra is a "ring".
Illustration[edit]
The integers, along with the two operations of addition and multiplication,
form the prototypical example of a ring.
The most familiar example of a ring is the set of all
integers


, consisting of the numbers
... , −5, −4, −3, −2, −1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4,
5, ...
The familiar properties for addition and multiplication of
integers serve as a model for the axioms of a ring.
Some properties[edit]
Some basic properties of a ring follow immediately from the
axioms:

The additive identity is unique.

The additive inverse of each element is unique.

The multiplicative identity is unique.

For any element x in a ring R, one has x0 = 0 = 0x (zero is
an absorbing element with respect to multiplication) and (–
1)x = –x.

If 0 = 1 in a ring R (or more generally, 0 is a unit element),
then R has only one element, and is called the zero ring.

If a ring R contains the zero ring as a subring, then R itself
is the zero ring.[6]

The binomial formula holds for
any x and y satisfying xy = yx.
Example: Integers modulo 4[edit]
See also: Modular arithmetic
Equip the
set


with the following operations:

The
sum


in Z/4Z is the remainder when the integer x + y is divided by 4
(as x + y is always smaller than 8, this remainder is
either x + y or x + y −4). For
example,


and


.

The
product


in Z/4Z is the remainder when the integer xy is divided by 4.
For
example,


and


.
Then Z/4Z is a ring: each axiom follows from the corresponding
axiom for Z. If x is an integer, the remainder of x when divided
by 4 may be considered as an element of Z/4Z, and this element
is often denoted by "x mod
4" or


, which is consistent with the notation for 0, 1, 2, 3. The
additive inverse of
any


in Z/4Z is


. For

example,


Example: 2-by-2 matrices[edit]
The set of 2-by-2 square matrices with entries in
a field F is[7][8][9][10]


With the operations of matrix addition and matrix
multiplication,


satisfies the above ring axioms. The
element


is the multiplicative identity of the ring.
If


and

then


while


; this example shows that the ring is noncommutative.
More generally, for any ring R, commutative or not, and any
nonnegative integer n, the square matrices of dimension n with
entries in R form a ring: see Matrix ring.
History[edit]
See also: Ring theory §°History
Richard Dedekind, one of the founders of ring theory.
Dedekind[edit]
The study of rings originated from the theory of polynomial
rings and the theory of algebraic integers.[11] In 1871, Richard
Dedekind defined the concept of the ring of integers of a number
field.[12] In this context, he introduced the terms "ideal" (inspired
by Ernst Kummer's notion of ideal number) and "module" and studied
their properties. Dedekind did not use the term "ring" and did not define
the concept of a ring in a general setting.
Hilbert[edit]
The term "Zahlring" (number ring) was coined by David Hilbert in
1892 and published in 1897.[13] In 19th century German, the word
"Ring" could mean "association", which is still used today in
English in a limited sense (for example, spy ring),[14] so if that
were the etymology then it would be similar to the way "group"
entered mathematics by being a non-technical word for "collection
of related things". According to Harvey Cohn, Hilbert used the term
for a ring that had the property of "circling directly back" to an
element of itself (in the sense of an equivalence).[15] Specifically,
in a ring of algebraic integers, all high powers of an
algebraic integer can be written as an integral combination of
a fixed set of lower powers, and thus the powers "cycle back". For
instance, if a3 −4a + 1 = 0 then a3 = 4a −1, a4 =
4a2 −a, a5 = −a2 + 16a −4, a6 = 16a2 −8a + 1, a7 =
−8a2 + 65a −16, and so on; in general, an is going to be
an integral linear combination of 1, a, and a2.
Fraenkel and Noether[edit]
The first axiomatic definition of a ring was given by Adolf
Fraenkel in 1915,[16][17] but his axioms were stricter than those in
the modern definition. For instance, he required every non-zero-

divisor to have a multiplicative inverse.[18] In 1921, Emmy
Noether gave a modern axiomatic definition of commutative rings
(with and without 1) and developed the foundations of
commutative ring theory in her paper Idealtheorie in
Ringbereichen.[19]
Multiplicative identity and the term "ring"[edit]
Fraenkel's axioms for a "ring" included that of a multiplicative
identity,[20] whereas Noether's did not.[19]
Most or all books on algebra[21][22] up to around 1960
followed Noether's convention of not requiring a 1 for a "ring".
Starting in the 1960s, it became increasingly common to see
books including the existence of 1 in the definition of "ring",
especially in advanced books by notable authors such as
Artin,[23] Atiyah and
MacDonald,[24] Bourbaki,[25] Eisenbud,[26] and
Lang.[27] There are also books published as late as 2006
that use the term without the requirement for a 1.[28][29][30]
Gardner and Wiegandt assert that, when dealing with several
objects in the category of rings (as opposed to working with a
fixed ring), if one requires all rings to have a 1, then some
consequences include the lack of existence of infinite direct sums of
rings, and that proper direct summands of rings are not subrings.
They conclude that "in many, maybe most, branches of ring
theory the requirement of the existence of a unity element is not
sensible, and therefore unacceptable."[31] Poonen makes the
counterargument that rings without a multiplicative identity are
not totally associative (the product of any finite sequence of
ring elements, including the empty sequence, is well-defined,
independent of the order of operations) and writes "the natural
extension of associativity demands that rings should contain an
empty product, so it is natural to require rings to have a 1".[32]
Authors who follow either convention for the use of the term "ring"
may use one of the following terms to refer to objects satisfying
the other convention:

to include a requirement a multiplicative identity: "unital ring",
"unitary ring", "unit ring", "ring with unity", "ring with
identity", "ring with a unit",[33] or "ring with 1".[34]

to omit a requirement for a multiplicative identity: "rng"[35] or
"pseudo-ring",[36] although the latter may be confusing
because it also has other meanings.
Basic examples[edit]
See also: Associative algebra §°Examples
Commutative rings[edit]

The prototypical example is the ring of integers with the two
operations of addition and multiplication.

The rational, real and complex numbers are commutative
rings of a type called fields.


A unital associative algebra over a commutative
ring R is itself a ring as well as an R-module. Some
examples:
o
The algebra R[X] of polynomials with coefficients in R.
As an R-module, R[X] is free of infinite rank.
o
The algebra R[[X1, ..., Xn]] of formal power
series with coefficients in R.
o
The set of all continuous real-valued functions defined on
the real line forms a commutative R-algebra. The
operations are pointwise addition and multiplication of
functions.
o
Let X be a set, and let R be a ring. Then the set of all
functions from X to R forms a ring, which is commutative
if R is commutative. The ring of continuous functions in
the previous example is a subring of this ring if X is the
real line and R = R.


, the integers with a real or complex number c adjoined. As
a Z-module, it is free of infinite rank if c is transcendental,
free of finite rank if c is an algebraic integer, and not free
otherwise.


, the set of decimal fractions. Not free as a Z-module.


, where d is a square-free integer of the form 4n + 1, with d ≠1.
A free Z-module of rank 2. See Quadratic integer.


, the Gaussian integers.


, the Eisenstein integers.

The previous two examples are the cases n = 4 and n = 3 of
the cyclotomic ring Z[ζn].

The previous four examples are cases of the ring of integers of
a number field K, defined as the set of algebraic integers in K.

The set of all algebraic integers in C forms a ring called
the integral closure of Z in C.

If S is a set, then the power set of S becomes a ring if we
define addition to be the symmetric difference of sets and
multiplication to be intersection. This is an example of
a Boolean ring.
Noncommutative rings[edit]

For any ring R and any natural number n, the set of all
square n-by-n matrices with entries from R, forms a ring with
matrix addition and matrix multiplication as operations.
For n = 1, this matrix ring is isomorphic to R itself. For n >
1 (and R not the zero ring), this matrix ring is
noncommutative.

If G is an abelian group, then the endomorphisms of G form
a ring, the endomorphism ring End(G) of G. The operations in
this ring are addition and composition of endomorphisms.
More generally, if V is a left module over a ring R, then the
set of all R-linear maps forms a ring, also called the
endomorphism ring and denoted by EndR(V).

If G is a group and R is a ring, the group ring of G over R is
a free module over R having G as basis. Multiplication is
defined by the rules that the elements of G commute with the
elements of R and multiply together as they do in the group G.

Many rings that appear in analysis are noncommutative.
For example, most Banach algebras are noncommutative.
Non-rings[edit]

The set of natural numbers N with the usual operations is not
a ring, since (N, +) is not even a group (the elements are not
all invertible with respect to addition). For instance, there
is no natural number which can be added to 3 to get 0 as a
result. There is a natural way to make it a ring by adding
negative numbers to the set, thus obtaining the ring of
integers. The natural numbers (including 0) form an algebraic
structure known as a semiring (which has all of the axioms of
a ring excluding that of an additive inverse).

Let R be the set of all continuous
functions on the real line that
vanish outside a bounded interval
that depends on the function, with
addition as usual but with
multiplication defined
as convolution:



Then R is a rng, but not a ring:
the Dirac delta function has the
property of a multiplicative
identity, but it is not a function
and hence is not an element of R.
Basic concepts[edit]
Products and powers[edit]
For each nonnegative integer n, given a
sequence


of n elements of R, one can define the
product


recursively: let P0 = 1 and let Pm = Pm−1 am for 1 ≤m ≤n.
As a special case, one can define nonnegative integer powers of
an element a of a ring: a0 = 1 and an = an−1 a for n ≥1.
Then am+n = am an for all m, n ≥0.
Elements in a ring[edit]
A left zero divisor of a
ring


is an
element
in the ring such that there exists a nonzero
element


of


such
that


.[c] A right zero divisor is defined similarly.
A nilpotent element is an
element
such
that


for
some


. One example of a nilpotent element is a nilpotent matrix. A
nilpotent element in a nonzero ring is necessarily a zero divisor.
An idempotent
is an element such
that


. One example of an idempotent element is a projection in linear
algebra.
A unit is an
element
having a multiplicative inverse; in this case the inverse is unique,
and is denoted
by


. The set of units of a ring is a group under ring multiplication;
this group is denoted
by


or


or


. For example, if R is the ring of all square matrices of
size n over a field,
then


consists of the set of all invertible matrices of size n, and is
called the general linear group.
Subring[edit]
Main article: Subring
A subset S of R is called a subring if any one of the following
equivalent conditions holds:

the addition and multiplication of R restrict to give
operations S × S →S making S a ring with the same
multiplicative identity as R.

1 ∈S; and for all x, y in S, the elements xy, x + y, and
−x are in S.

S can be equipped with operations making it a ring such that
the inclusion map S →R is a ring homomorphism.
For example, the ring Z of integers is a subring of the field of
real numbers and also a subring of the ring of polynomials Z[X]
(in both cases, Z contains 1, which is the multiplicative
identity of the larger rings). On the other hand, the subset of even
integers 2Z does not contain the identity element 1 and thus does
not qualify as a subring of Z; one could call 2Z a subrng,
however.
An intersection of subrings is a subring. Given a subset E of R,
the smallest subring of R containing E is the intersection of all
subrings of R containing E, and it is called the subring generated
by E.
For a ring R, the smallest subring of R is called
the characteristic subring of R. It can be generated through
addition of copies of 1 and −1. It is possible
that


(n times) can be zero. If n is the smallest positive integer such
that this occurs, then n is called the characteristic of R. In some
rings,


is never zero for any positive integer n, and those rings are said
to have characteristic zero.
Given a ring R,
let


denote the set of all elements x in R such that x commutes with every
element
in R:

for any y in R.
Then


is a subring of R, called the center of R. More generally,
given a subset X of R, let S be the set of all elements
in R that commute with every element in X. Then S is a subring
of R, called the centralizer (or commutant) of X. The center is the
centralizer of the entire ring R. Elements or subsets of the center are
said to be central in R; they (each individually) generate a
subring of the center.
Ideal[edit]
Main article: Ideal (ring theory)
Let R be a ring. A left ideal of R is a nonempty
subset I of R such that for any x, y in I and r in R, the
elements


and
are in I.
If


denotes the R-span of I, that is, the set of finite sums


then I is a left ideal
if


. Similarly, a right ideal is a subset I such
that


. A subset I is said to be a two-sided ideal or simply ideal if it
is both a left ideal and right ideal. A one-sided or two-sided
ideal is then an additive subgroup of R. If E is a subset of R,
then


is a left ideal, called the left ideal generated by E; it is the
smallest left ideal containing E. Similarly, one can consider
the right ideal or the two-sided ideal generated by a subset of R.
If x is in R,
then


and


are left ideals and right ideals, respectively; they are called
the principal left ideals and right ideals generated by x. The
principal
ideal


is written
as


. For example, the set of all positive and negative multiples
of 2 along with 0 form an ideal of the integers, and this ideal
is generated by the integer 2. In fact, every ideal of the ring of
integers is principal.
Like a group, a ring is said to be simple if it is nonzero and it
has no proper nonzero two-sided ideals. A commutative simple ring
is precisely a field.
Rings are often studied with special conditions set upon their ideals.
For example, a ring in which there is no strictly increasing
infinite chain of left ideals is called a left Noetherian ring. A
ring in which there is no strictly decreasing infinite chain of left
ideals is called a left Artinian ring. It is a somewhat surprising
fact that a left Artinian ring is left Noetherian (the Hopkins–
Levitzki theorem). The integers, however, form a Noetherian
ring which is not Artinian.
For commutative rings, the ideals generalize the classical
notion of divisibility and decomposition of an integer into
prime numbers in algebra. A proper ideal P of R is called
a prime ideal if for any
elements


we have
that


implies
either


or


. Equivalently, P is prime if for any
ideals


we have
that


implies
either


or


This latter formulation illustrates the idea of ideals as
generalizations of elements.
Homomorphism[edit]
Main article: Ring homomorphism
A homomorphism from a ring (R, +, ⋅) to a ring (S, ‡,
∗) is a function f from R to S that preserves the ring operations;
namely, such that, for all a, b in R the following identities
hold:

f(a + b) = f(a) ‡ f(b)

f(a ⋅b) = f(a) ∗f(b)

f(1R) = 1S
If one is working with rngs, then the third condition is dropped.
A ring homomorphism f is said to be an isomorphism if there exists
an inverse homomorphism to f (that is, a ring homomorphism
that is an inverse function). Any bijective ring homomorphism is
a ring isomorphism. Two
rings


are said to be isomorphic if there is an isomorphism between them
and in that case one
writes


. A ring homomorphism between the same ring is called an
endomorphism and an isomorphism between the same ring an
automorphism.
Examples:

The function that maps each integer x to its remainder modulo 4
(a number in {0, 1, 2, 3}) is a homomorphism from the
ring Z to the quotient ring Z/4Z ("quotient ring" is defined
below).

If
is a unit element in a ring R,

then


is a ring homomorphism, called an inner automorphism of R.

Let R be a commutative ring of prime characteristic p.
Then


is a ring endomorphism of R called the Frobenius
homomorphism.

The Galois group of a field
extension


is the set of all automorphisms of L whose restrictions
to K are the identity.

For any ring R, there are a unique ring
homomorphism Z →R and a unique ring homomorphism R →0.

An epimorphism (that is, right-cancelable morphism) of rings
need not be surjective. For example, the unique map Z →Q is
an epimorphism.

An algebra homomorphism from a k-algebra to
the endomorphism algebra of a vector space over k is called
a representation of the algebra.
Given a ring
homomorphism


, the set of all elements mapped to 0 by f is called the kernel of f.
The kernel is a two-sided ideal of R. The image of f, on the
other hand, is not always an ideal, but it is always a
subring of S.
To give a ring homomorphism from a commutative ring R to a
ring A with image contained in the center of A is the same as to give
a structure of an algebra over R to A (which in particular gives
a structure of an A-module).
Quotient ring[edit]
Main article: Quotient ring
The notion of quotient ring is analogous to the notion of
a quotient group. Given a ring (R, +, ⋅) and a two-
sided ideal I of (R, +, ⋅), view I as subgroup of (R, +);
then the quotient ring R/I is the set of cosets of I together with the
operations
(a + I) + (b + I) = (a + b) + I and
(a + I)(b + I) = (ab) + I.
for all a, b in R. The ring R/I is also called a factor ring.
As with a quotient group, there is a canonical
homomorphism


, given
by


. It is surjective and satisfies the following universal property:


If


is a ring homomorphism such
that


, then there is a unique
homomorphism


such
that


.
For any ring
homomorphism


, invoking the universal property
with


produces a
homomorphism


that gives an isomorphism
from


to the image of f.
Module[edit]
Main article: Module (mathematics)
The concept of a module over a ring generalizes the concept of
a vector space (over a field) by generalizing from
multiplication of vectors with elements of a field (scalar
multiplication) to multiplication with elements of a ring. More
precisely, given a ring R with 1, an R-module M is an abelian
group equipped with an operation R × M →M (associating an
element of M to every pair of an element of R and an element
of M) that satisfies certain axioms. This operation is
commonly denoted multiplicatively and called multiplication.
The axioms of modules are the following: for
all a, b in R and all x, y in M, we have:

M is an abelian group under addition.






When the ring is noncommutative these axioms define left
modules; right modules are defined similarly by writing xa instead
of ax. This is not only a change of notation, as the last
axiom of right modules (that is x(ab) = (xa)b)
becomes (ab)x = b(ax), if left multiplication (by ring elements)
is used for a right module.
Basic examples of modules are ideals, including the ring itself.
Although similarly defined, the theory of modules is much more
complicated than that of vector space, mainly, because,
unlike vector spaces, modules are not characterized (up to an
isomorphism) by a single invariant (the dimension of a vector
space). In particular, not all modules have a basis.
The axioms of modules imply that (−1)x = −x, where the first
minus denotes the additive inverse in the ring and the second minus the
additive inverse in the module. Using this and denoting repeated
addition by a multiplication by a positive integer allows
identifying abelian groups with modules over the ring of integers.
Any ring homomorphism induces a structure of a module:
if f : R →S is a ring homomorphism, then S is a left module
over R by the multiplication: rs = f(r)s. If R is commutative or
if f(R) is contained in the center of S, the ring S is called a R-
algebra. In particular, every ring is an algebra over the
integers.
Constructions[edit]
Direct product[edit]
Main article: Direct product of rings
Let R and S be rings. Then the product R × S can be equipped with
the following natural ring structure:

(r1, s1) + (r2, s2) = (r1 + r2, s1 + s2)

(r1, s1) ⋅(r2, s2) = (r1 ⋅ r2, s1 ⋅ s2)
for all r1, r2 in R and s1, s2 in S. The ring R × S with the
above operations of addition and multiplication and the
multiplicative
identity


is called the direct product of R with S. The same construction
also works for an arbitrary family of rings:
if


are rings indexed by a set I,
then


is a ring with componentwise addition and multiplication.
Let R be a commutative ring
and

be ideals such
that


whenever


. Then the Chinese remainder theorem says there is a canonical ring
isomorphism:


.
A "finite" direct product may also be viewed as a direct sum of
ideals.[37] Namely,
let


be
rings,


the inclusions with the
images
(in

particular
are rings though not subrings).
Then

are ideals of R and


as a direct sum of abelian groups (because for abelian groups
finite products are the same as direct sums). Clearly the direct sum of
such ideals also defines a product of rings that is isomorphic to R.
Equivalently, the above can be done through central
idempotents. Assume that R has the above decomposition. Then
we can write


By the conditions
on
, one has

that
are central idempotents
and


(orthogonal). Again, one can reverse the construction. Namely,
if one is given a partition of 1 in orthogonal central
idempotents, then
let


, which are two-sided ideals. If
each

is not a sum of orthogonal central idempotents,[d] then their direct
sum is isomorphic to R.
An important application of an infinite direct product is the
construction of a projective limit of rings (see below). Another
application is a restricted product of a family of rings
(cf. adele ring).
Polynomial ring[edit]
Main article: Polynomial ring
Given a symbol t (called a variable) and a commutative
ring R, the set of polynomials


forms a commutative ring with the usual addition and
multiplication, containing R as a subring. It is called
the polynomial ring over R. More generally, the
set


of all polynomials in
variables


forms a commutative ring,
containing


as subrings.
If R is an integral domain,
then


is also an integral domain; its field of fractions is the field
of rational functions. If R is a Noetherian ring,
then


is a Noetherian ring. If R is a unique factorization domain,
then


is a unique factorization domain. Finally, R is a field if
and only
if


is a principal ideal domain.

Let


be commutative rings. Given an element x of S, one can
consider the ring homomorphism


(that is, the substitution). If S = R[t] and x = t, then f(t) = f.
Because of this, the polynomial f is often also denoted
by


. The image of the
map


is denoted
by


; it is the same thing as the subring of S generated by R and x.

Example:


denotes the image of the homomorphism


In other words, it is the subalgebra
of


generated by t2 and t3.
Example: let f be a polynomial in one variable, that is,
an element in a polynomial ring R.
Then


is an element
in


and


is divisible by h in that ring. The result of substituting zero
to h in


is


, the derivative of f at x.
The substitution is a special case of the universal property of
a polynomial ring. The property states: given a ring
homomorphism


and an element x in S there exists a unique ring
homomorphism


such
that


and


restricts
to


.[38] For example, choosing a basis, a symmetric
algebra satisfies the universal property and so is a
polynomial ring.
To give an example, let S be the ring of all functions
from R to itself; the addition and the multiplication are those of
functions. Let x be the identity function. Each r in R defines a
constant function, giving rise to the
homomorphism


. The universal property says that this map extends uniquely to


(t maps to x)
where


is the polynomial function defined by f. The resulting map is
injective if and only if R is infinite.
Given a non-constant monic
polynomial f in


, there exists a ring S containing R such that f is a product of
linear factors
in


.[39]
Let k be an algebraically closed field. The Hilbert's
Nullstellensatz (theorem of zeros) states that there is a natural
one-to-one correspondence between the set of all prime ideals
in


and the set of closed subvarieties
of


. In particular, many local problems in algebraic geometry
may be attacked through the study of the generators of an ideal in
a polynomial ring. (cf. Gröbner basis.)
There are some other related constructions. A formal power series
ring


consists of formal power series


together with multiplication and addition that mimic those for
convergent series. It
contains


as a subring. A formal power series ring does not have the
universal property of a polynomial ring; a series may not
converge after a substitution. The important advantage of a
formal power series ring over a polynomial ring is that it
is local (in fact, complete).
Matrix ring and endomorphism ring[edit]
Main articles: Matrix ring and Endomorphism ring
Let R be a ring (not necessarily commutative). The set of all
square matrices of size n with entries in R forms a ring with the entry-
wise addition and the usual matrix multiplication. It is called
the matrix ring and is denoted by Mn(R). Given a right R-
module


, the set of all R-linear maps from U to itself forms a ring with
addition that is of function and multiplication that is
of composition of functions; it is called the endomorphism ring
of U and is denoted
by


.
As in linear algebra, a matrix ring may be canonically
interpreted as an endomorphism
ring:


. This is a special case of the following fact:
If


is an R-linear map, then f may be written as a matrix with
entries


in


, resulting in the ring isomorphism:


Any ring homomorphism R →S induces Mn(R) →Mn(S).[40]
Schur's lemma says that if U is a simple right R-module,
then


is a division
ring.[41] If


is a direct sum of mi-copies of simple R-
modules


, then


.
The Artin–Wedderburn theorem states any semisimple ring (cf. below)
is of this form.
A ring R and the matrix ring Mn(R) over it are Morita equivalent:
the category of right modules of R is equivalent to the category
of right modules over Mn(R).[40] In particular, two-sided ideals
in R correspond in one-to-one to two-sided ideals in Mn(R).
Limits and colimits of rings[edit]
Let Ri be a sequence of rings such that Ri is a subring of Ri+1 for
all i. Then the union (or filtered colimit) of Ri is the
ring


defined as follows: it is the disjoint union of all Ri's modulo the
equivalence
relation

if and only
if
in Ri for sufficiently large i.

Examples of colimits:


A polynomial ring in infinitely many
variables:



The algebraic closure of finite fields of the same
characteristic



The field of formal Laurent series over a
field k:


(it is the field of fractions of the formal power series
ring


.)

The function field of an algebraic variety over a
field k is


where the limit runs over all the coordinate
rings


of nonempty open subsets U (more succinctly it is the stalk of
the structure sheaf at the generic point.)
Any commutative ring is the colimit of finitely generated subrings.
A projective limit (or a filtered limit) of rings is defined as
follows. Suppose we're given a family of
rings


, i running over positive integers, say, and ring
homomorphisms


such
that


are all the identities
and


is


whenever


.
Then


is the subring
of


consisting
of


such
that


maps
to
under


.
For an example of a projective limit, see §°Completion.
Localization[edit]
The localization generalizes the construction of the field of
fractions of an integral domain to an arbitrary ring and
modules. Given a (not necessarily commutative) ring R and a
subset S of R, there exists a
ring


together with the ring
homomorphism


that "inverts" S; that is, the homomorphism maps elements
in S to unit elements
in


, and, moreover, any ring homomorphism from R that
"inverts" S uniquely factors
through


.[42] The
ring


is called the localization of R with respect to S. For example,
if R is a commutative ring and f an element in R, then the
localization


consists of elements of the
form


(to be
precise,


)[43]
The localization is frequently applied to a commutative
ring R with respect to the complement of a prime ideal (or a union
of prime ideals) in R. In that
case


, one often
writes


for


.


is then a local ring with the maximal
ideal


. This is the reason for the terminology "localization". The
field of fractions of an integral domain R is the localization
of R at the prime ideal zero.
If


is a prime ideal of a commutative ring R, then the field of
fractions
of


is the same as the residue field of the local
ring


and is denoted
by


.
If M is a left R-module, then the localization of M with respect
to S is given by a change of
rings


.
The most important properties of localization are the
following: when R is a commutative ring and S a
multiplicatively closed subset


is a bijection between the set of all prime ideals
in R disjoint from S and the set of all prime ideals
in


.[44]


, f running over elements in S with partial ordering given by
divisibility.[45]

The localization is exact:


is exact
over


whenever


is exact over R.


Conversely,
if


is exact for any maximal
ideal
,
then


is exact.

A remark: localization is no help in proving a global
existence. One instance of this is that if two modules are
isomorphic at all prime ideals, it does not follow that they
are isomorphic. (One way to explain this is that the
localization allows one to view a module as a sheaf over
prime ideals and a sheaf is inherently a local notion.)
In category theory, a localization of a category amounts to
making some morphisms isomorphisms. An element in a
commutative ring R may be thought of as an endomorphism of
any R-module. Thus, categorically, a localization
of R with respect to a subset S of R is a functor from the category
of R-modules to itself that sends elements of S viewed as
endomorphisms to automorphisms and is universal with respect to
this property. (Of course, R then maps
to


and R-modules map
to


-modules.)
Completion[edit]
Let R be a commutative ring, and let I be an ideal of R.
The completion of R at I is the projective
limit


; it is a commutative ring. The canonical homomorphisms
from R to the
quotients


induce a
homomorphism


. The latter homomorphism is injective if R is a Noetherian
integral domain and I is a proper ideal, or if R is a
Noetherian local ring with maximal ideal I, by Krull's
intersection theorem.[46] The construction is especially useful
when I is a maximal ideal.
The basic example is the completion of Z at the principal ideal
(p) generated by a prime number p; it is called the ring of p-adic
integers and is denoted Zp. The completion can in this case be
constructed also from the p-adic absolute value on Q. The p-
adic absolute value on Q is a
map


from Q to R given
by


where


denotes the exponent of p in the prime factorization of a nonzero
integer n into prime numbers (we also
put


and


). It defines a distance function on Q and the completion of Q as
a metric space is denoted by Qp. It is again a field since the field
operations extend to the completion. The subring of Qp consisting
of
elements x with


is isomorphic to Zp.
Similarly, the formal power series
ring


is the completion
of


at


(see also Hensel's lemma)
A complete ring has much simpler structure than a commutative ring.
This owns to the Cohen structure theorem, which says, roughly,
that a complete local ring tends to look like a formal power
series ring or a quotient of it. On the other hand, the interaction
between the integral closure and completion has been among the
most important aspects that distinguish modern commutative ring
theory from the classical one developed by the likes of Noether.
Pathological examples found by Nagata led to the
reexamination of the roles of Noetherian rings and motivated,
among other things, the definition of excellent ring.
Rings with generators and relations[edit]
The most general way to construct a ring is by specifying
generators and relations. Let F be a free ring (that is, free
algebra over the integers) with the set X of symbols, that
is, F consists of polynomials with integral coefficients in
noncommuting variables that are elements of X. A free ring
satisfies the universal property: any function from the set X to a
ring R factors through F so
that


is the unique ring homomorphism. Just as in the group case, every
ring can be represented as a quotient of a free ring.[47]
Now, we can impose relations among symbols in X by taking a
quotient. Explicitly, if E is a subset of F, then the quotient
ring of F by the ideal generated by E is called the ring with
generators X and relations E. If we used a ring, say, A as a
base ring instead of Z, then the resulting ring will be over A.
For example,
if


, then the resulting ring will be the usual polynomial ring with
coefficients in A in variables that are elements of X (It is also
the same thing as the symmetric algebra over A with symbols X.)
In the category-theoretic terms, the
formation


is the left adjoint functor of the forgetful functor from the category
of rings to Set (and it is often called the free ring functor.)
Let A, B be algebras over a commutative ring R. Then the
tensor product of R-
modules


is an R-algebra with multiplication characterized
by


. See also: Tensor product of algebras, Change of rings.
Special kinds of rings[edit]
Domains[edit]
A nonzero ring with no nonzero zero-divisors is called a domain.
A commutative domain is called an integral domain. The most
important integral domains are principal ideal domains, PIDs
for short, and fields. A principal ideal domain is an integral
domain in which every ideal is principal. An important class of
integral domains that contain a PID is a unique factorization
domain (UFD), an integral domain in which every nonunit element
is a product of prime elements (an element is prime if it generates
a prime ideal.) The fundamental question in algebraic number
theory is on the extent to which the ring of (generalized) integers in
a number field, where an "ideal" admits prime factorization,
fails to be a PID.
Among theorems concerning a PID, the most important one is
the structure theorem for finitely generated modules over a principal
ideal domain. The theorem may be illustrated by the following
application to linear algebra.[48] Let V be a finite-
dimensional vector space over a
field k and


a linear map with minimal polynomial q. Then,
since


is a unique factorization domain, q factors into powers of
distinct irreducible polynomials (that is, prime elements):


Letting


, we make V a k[t]-module. The structure theorem then says V is a
direct sum of cyclic modules, each of which is isomorphic to the
module of the
form


. Now,
if


, then such a cyclic module
(for
) has a basis in which the restriction of f is represented by

a Jordan matrix. Thus, if, say, k is algebraically closed,
then
all

's are of the
form


and the above decomposition corresponds to the Jordan
canonical form of f.
In algebraic geometry, UFDs arise because of smoothness.
More precisely, a point in a variety (over a perfect field) is
smooth if the local ring at the point is a regular local ring. A
regular local ring is a UFD.[49]
The following is a chain of class inclusions that describes the
relationship between rings, domains and fields:
rngs ⊃rings ⊃commutative rings ⊃integral domains ⊃int
egrally closed domains ⊃GCD domains ⊃unique factoriz
ation domains ⊃principal ideal domains ⊃Euclidean d
omains ⊃fields ⊃algebraically closed fields
Division ring[edit]
A division ring is a ring such that every non-zero element is a unit.
A commutative division ring is a field. A prominent example of a
division ring that is not a field is the ring of quaternions. Any
centralizer in a division ring is also a division ring. In
particular, the center of a division ring is a field. It turned out
that every finite domain (in particular finite division ring) is a
field; in particular commutative (the Wedderburn's little theorem).
Every module over a division ring is a free module (has a
basis); consequently, much of linear algebra can be carried out
over a division ring instead of a field.
The study of conjugacy classes figures prominently in the classical
theory of division rings; see, for example, the Cartan–Brauer–
Hua theorem.
A cyclic algebra, introduced by L. E. Dickson, is a
generalization of a quaternion algebra.
Semisimple rings[edit]
Main article: Semisimple module
A semisimple module is a direct sum of simple modules. A semisimple
ring is a ring that is semisimple as a left module (or right module)
over itself.
Examples[edit]

A division ring is semisimple (and simple).

For any division ring D and positive integer n, the matrix
ring Mn(D) is semisimple (and simple).

For a field k and finite group G, the group ring kG is semisimple
if and only if the characteristic of k does not divide
the order of G (Maschke's theorem).

Clifford algebras are semisimple.
The Weyl algebra over a field is a simple ring, but it is not
semisimple. The same holds for a ring of differential operators
in many variables.
Properties[edit]

Any module over a semisimple ring is semisimple. (Proof: A free
module over a semisimple ring is semisimple and any module is a
quotient of a free module.)
For a ring R, the following are equivalent:

R is semisimple.

R is artinian and semiprimitive.

R is a finite direct
product


where each ni is a positive integer, and each Di is a division
ring (Artin–Wedderburn theorem).
Semisimplicity is closely related to separability. A unital
associative algebra A over a field k is said to
be separable if the base
extension


is semisimple for every field
extension


. If A happens to be a field, then this is equivalent to the
usual definition in field theory (cf. separable extension.)
Central simple algebra and Brauer group[edit]
Main article: Central simple algebra
For a field k, a k-algebra is central if its center is k and is
simple if it is a simple ring. Since the center of a simple k-
algebra is a field, any simple k-algebra is a central simple
algebra over its center. In this section, a central simple
algebra is assumed to have finite dimension. Also, we mostly
fix the base field; thus, an algebra refers to a k-algebra.
The matrix ring of size n over a ring R will be denoted
by


.
The Skolem–Noether theorem states any automorphism of a
central simple algebra is inner.
Two central simple algebras A and B are said to be similar if
there are integers n and m such
that


.[50] Since


, the similarity is an equivalence relation. The similarity
classes


with the
multiplication


form an abelian group called the Brauer group of k and is denoted
by


. By the Artin–Wedderburn theorem, a central simple algebra is the
matrix ring of a division ring; thus, each similarity class is
represented by a unique division ring.
For
example,


is trivial if k is a finite field or an algebraically closed
field (more generally quasi-algebraically closed field;
cf. Tsen's
theorem).


has order 2 (a special case of the theorem of Frobenius).
Finally, if k is a nonarchimedean local field (for
example,


),
then


through the invariant map.
Now, if F is a field extension of k, then the base
extension


induces


. Its kernel is denoted
by


. It consists
of


such
that


is a matrix ring over F (that is, A is split by F.) If the
extension is finite and Galois,
then


is canonically isomorphic
to


.[51]
Azumaya algebras generalize the notion of central simple
algebras to a commutative local ring.
Valuation ring[edit]
Main article: Valuation ring
If K is a field, a valuation v is a group homomorphism from
the multiplicative group K∗to a totally ordered abelian
group G such that, for any f, g in K with f + g nonzero, v(f + g)
≥min{v(f), v(g)}. The valuation ring of v is the subring
of K consisting of zero and all nonzero f such that v(f) ≥0.
Examples:

The field of formal Laurent
series


over a field k comes with the valuation v such that v(f) is
the least degree of a nonzero term in f; the valuation ring
of v is the formal power series
ring


.

More generally, given a
field k and a totally ordered
abelian group G,
let


be the set of all functions
from G to k whose supports (the sets
of points at which the functions are
nonzero) are well ordered. It is a
field with the multiplication given
by convolution:


.

It also comes with the
valuation v such that v(f) is the
least element in the support of f.
The subring consisting of elements
with finite support is called the group
ring of G (which makes sense even
if G is not commutative). If G is
the ring of integers, then we recover the
previous example (by
identifying f with the series whose n-th
coefficient is f(n).)
See also: Novikov ring and uniserial ring.
Rings with extra structure[edit]
A ring may be viewed as an abelian group (by using the
addition operation), with extra structure: namely, ring
multiplication. In the same way, there are other mathematical
objects which may be considered as rings with extra structure. For
example:

An associative algebra is a ring that is also a vector
space over a field K such that the scalar multiplication is
compatible with the ring multiplication. For instance, the
set of n-by-n matrices over the real field R has
dimension n2 as a real vector space.

A ring R is a topological ring if its set of elements R is given
a topology which makes the addition map
(


) and the multiplication map
(


) to be both continuous as maps between topological spaces
(where X × X inherits the product topology or any other product in
the category). For example, n-by-n matrices over the real
numbers could be given either the Euclidean topology, or
the Zariski topology, and in either case one would obtain
a topological ring.

A λ-ring is a commutative ring R together with
operations λn: R →R that are like n-th exterior powers:


.
For example, Z is a λ-ring
with


, the binomial coefficients. The notion plays a central
rule in the algebraic approach to the Riemann–Roch theorem.

A totally ordered ring is a ring with a total ordering that is
compatible with ring operations.
Some examples of the ubiquity of rings[edit]
Many different kinds of mathematical objects can be fruitfully
analyzed in terms of some associated ring.
Cohomology ring of a topological space[edit]
To any topological space X one can associate its
integral cohomology ring


a graded ring. There are also homology
groups


of a space, and indeed these were defined first, as a useful tool
for distinguishing between certain pairs of topological spaces,
like the spheres and tori, for which the methods of point-set
topology are not well-suited. Cohomology groups were later
defined in terms of homology groups in a way which is roughly
analogous to the dual of a vector space. To know each
individual integral homology group is essentially the same as
knowing each individual integral cohomology group, because of
the universal coefficient theorem. However, the advantage of the
cohomology groups is that there is a natural product, which is
analogous to the observation that one can multiply pointwise
a k-multilinear form and an l-multilinear form to get a (k + l)-
multilinear form.
The ring structure in cohomology provides the foundation
for characteristic classes of fiber bundles, intersection theory on
manifolds and algebraic varieties, Schubert calculus and much
more.
Burnside ring of a group[edit]
To any group is associated its Burnside ring which uses a ring to
describe the various ways the group can act on a finite set. The
Burnside ring's additive group is the free abelian group whose basis
are the transitive actions of the group and whose addition is the
disjoint union of the action. Expressing an action in terms of the
basis is decomposing an action into its transitive constituents.
The multiplication is easily expressed in terms of
the representation ring: the multiplication in the Burnside ring is
formed by writing the tensor product of two permutation modules as
a permutation module. The ring structure allows a formal way of
subtracting one action from another. Since the Burnside ring is
contained as a finite index subring of the representation ring, one
can pass easily from one to the other by extending the coefficients
from integers to the rational numbers.
Representation ring of a group ring[edit]
To any group ring or Hopf algebra is associated
its representation ring or "Green ring". The representation ring's
additive group is the free abelian group whose basis are the
indecomposable modules and whose addition corresponds to the
direct sum. Expressing a module in terms of the basis is finding an
indecomposable decomposition of the module. The
multiplication is the tensor product. When the algebra is
semisimple, the representation ring is just the character ring
from character theory, which is more or less the Grothendieck
group given a ring structure.
Function field of an irreducible algebraic variety[edit]
To any irreducible algebraic variety is associated its function
field. The points of an algebraic variety correspond
to valuation rings contained in the function field and containing
the coordinate ring. The study of algebraic geometry makes
heavy use of commutative algebra to study geometric concepts in

terms of ring-theoretic properties. Birational geometry studies maps
between the subrings of the function field.
Face ring of a simplicial complex[edit]
Every simplicial complex has an associated face ring, also
called its Stanley–Reisner ring. This ring reflects many of the
combinatorial properties of the simplicial complex, so it is of
particular interest in algebraic combinatorics. In particular,
the algebraic geometry of the Stanley–Reisner ring was used to
characterize the numbers of faces in each dimension of simplicial
polytopes.
Category-theoretic description[edit]
Main article: Category of rings
Every ring can be thought of as a monoid in Ab, the category
of abelian groups (thought of as a monoidal category under
the tensor product
of


-modules). The monoid action of a ring R on an abelian group
is simply an R-module. Essentially, an R-module is a
generalization of the notion of a vector space – where rather
than a vector space over a field, one has a "vector space over
a ring".
Let (A, +) be an abelian group and let End(A) be
its endomorphism ring (see above). Note that, essentially,
End(A) is the set of all morphisms of A, where if f is in End(A),
and g is in End(A), the following rules may be used to
compute f + g and f ⋅g:

(f + g)(x) = f(x) + g(x)

(f ⋅ g)(x) = f(g(x)),
where + as in f(x) + g(x) is addition in A, and function
composition is denoted from right to left.
Therefore, associated to any abelian group, is a ring.
Conversely, given any ring, (R, +, ⋅), (R, +) is an
abelian group. Furthermore, for every r in R, right (or left)
multiplication by r gives rise to a morphism of (R, +), by
right (or left) distributivity. Let A = (R, +). Consider
those endomorphisms of A, that "factor through" right (or left)
multiplication of R. In other words, let EndR(A) be the set of
all morphisms m of A, having the property that m(r ⋅ x)
= r ⋅m(x). It was seen that every r in R gives rise to a morphism
of A: right multiplication by r. It is in fact true that this
association of any element of R, to a morphism of A, as a
function from R to EndR(A), is an isomorphism of rings. In this
sense, therefore, any ring can be viewed as the endomorphism ring
of some abelian X-group (by X-group, it is meant a group
with X being its set of operators).[52] In essence, the most general
form of a ring, is the endomorphism group of some abelian X-
group.
Any ring can be seen as a preadditive category with a single
object. It is therefore natural to consider arbitrary preadditive
categories to be generalizations of rings. And indeed, many
definitions and theorems originally given for rings can be
translated to this more general context. Additive functors between
preadditive categories generalize the concept of ring homomorphism,
and ideals in additive categories can be defined as sets
of morphisms closed under addition and under composition with
arbitrary morphisms.
Generalization[edit]
Algebraists have defined structures more general than rings by
weakening or dropping some of ring axioms.
Rng[edit]
A rng is the same as a ring, except that the existence of a
multiplicative identity is not assumed.[53]
Nonassociative ring[edit]

A nonassociative ring is an algebraic structure that satisfies
all of the ring axioms except the associative property and the
existence of a multiplicative identity. A notable example is
a Lie algebra. There exists some structure theory for such
algebras that generalizes the analogous results for Lie
algebras and associative algebras.[citation needed]
Semiring[edit]
A semiring (sometimes rig) is obtained by weakening the
assumption that (R, +) is an abelian group to the assumption
that (R, +) is a commutative monoid, and adding the axiom
that 0 ⋅a = a ⋅0 = 0 for all a in R (since it no longer
follows from the other axioms).
Examples:

the non-negative
integers


with ordinary addition and multiplication;

the tropical semiring.
Other ring-like objects[edit]
Ring object in a category[edit]
Let C be a category with finite products. Let pt denote a terminal
object of C (an empty product). A ring object in C is an
object R equipped with
morphisms


(addition),


(multiplication),


(additive
identity),


(additive inverse),
and


(multiplicative identity) satisfying the usual ring axioms.
Equivalently, a ring object is an object R equipped with a
factorization of its functor of
points


through the category of
rings:


.
Ring scheme[edit]
In algebraic geometry, a ring scheme over a base scheme S is a
ring object in the category of S-schemes. One example is the ring
scheme Wn over Spec Z, which for any commutative ring A returns the
ring Wn(A) of p-isotypic Witt vectors of length n over A.[54]
Ring spectrum[edit]
In algebraic topology, a ring spectrum is a spectrum X together
with a
multiplication


and a unit
map


from the sphere spectrum S, such that the ring axiom diagrams
commute up to homotopy. In practice, it is common to define a
ring spectrum as a monoid object in a good category of spectra
such as the category of symmetric spectra.

Notes[edit]
1. ^ This means that each operation is defined and produces a unique result
in R for each ordered pair of elements of R.
2. ^ The existence of 1 is not assumed by some authors; here, the term rng is used if
existence of a multiplicative identity is not assumed. See next subsection.
3. ^ Some other authors such as Lang require a zero divisor to be nonzero.
4. ^ Such a central idempotent is called centrally primitive.
