INTRODUCTION
This book can help you greatly reduce the time and effort involved in
learning to read Japanese. It does so by introducing a method that is both
effective and easy to use in memorizing the meanings and pronunciations of
kanji, the array of characters that are used in the language to symbolize
everything from abstract ideas to concrete nouns.
Learning any of the kanji, you will find, is a two-step process, requiring
that you remember both the visual aspect of a character (so you can recognize
it when you see it) and the aural aspect (so you will know how to say and,
thus, read it). The method presented here will show you how to tackle both of
these aspects from the outset, and by so doing enable you to immediately get
down to the practical (and fun!) business of recognizing and reading kanji on
everything from street signs to newspapers. By the time you finish this book,
in fact, you will be able to boast of a Japanese vocabulary numbering in the
thousands of words.
Kanji and the Japanese Writing System
Kanji (literally, “Chinese characters”) arrived in Japan along with Buddhism
and other aspects of Chinese culture approximately 1,500 years ago. As with
many concepts introduced into the country from abroad, this writing system
was gradually shaped and modified over the centuries to better suit the
Japanese themselves. Kanji today comprise one part of written Japanese,
being used alongside a pair of much simpler phonetic syllabaries, katakana
and hiragana. Katakana are generally employed to denote foreign words, as
well as various technical and scientific terms. Hiragana, on the other hand,
have a largely grammatical function, and are used for everything from verb
endings to particles. As you can see from the examples below, katakana and
hiragana are visually similar; they never contain more than four strokes.
Kanji, however, are more varied; they can have anywhere from one to more

than 20 strokes.
Hirigana:
か
き
く
け
こ
Katakana:
カ
キ
ク
ケ
コ
Kanji:
東
曜
秋
語
意
Written Japanese is thus a mixture of three elements, and a single
sentence can have all three present, as in the following example.
アフリカで水牛とキリンを見ました。
I saw a water buffalo and a giraffe in Africa.
Number and Frequency of Kanji
As katakana and hiragana can be learned quickly (there are only around fifty
of each), this book will focus exclusively on mastering kanji. It’s worth
keeping in mind that the Japanese Ministry of Education has stipulated that
high school students in Japan are expected to learn 1,945 characters (the so-
called “general-use” kanji) by the time they graduate. Magazines and
newspapers can employ upwards of 3,000 kanji, although these “extra”
characters are often accompanied by hiragana showing how they are to be
pronounced; without; this, most Japanese would often be unsure of both the
meaning of the character in question and its pronunciation.
Despite there being so many kanji, it is important to understand that some
are used far more frequently than others. The 500 most common, for
example, make up approximately 80% of the kanji you will see. The 1,000
most common bring this figure to over 90%. Learning the 200 kanji presented
in this volume, therefore, will offer great immediate benefit.
The Composition of Kanji
In general, kanji dictionaries divide characters into groups that share a
common part (call a “radical”). As you can see below, the kanji in the first
row all share the same left-hand radical . The kanji in the second row share
the same top 
, while the radical in the third row (
) appears in various

positions.
休
化
体
安
家
字
冬
夏
愛
At times this book will break kanji apart into fragments smaller than
radicals. To keep things simple, all radicals and parts that make up a kanji –
but are not themselves kanji – are called components, and will always be
presented in a separate text box immediately before the first character in
which they appear.
Stroke Order
Stroke order refers to the sequence of lines that are used to correctly write out
a kanji. Knowing this order is important for several reasons. First, it will help
train you to quickly count the number of strokes in a character, and thus make
it easier to locate unfamiliar kanji (or those for which pronunciations may
have been forgotten) in a kanji dictionary. It will also aid you in breaking
down characters visually, making it easier to see the components that will
help you recall a kanji’s meaning. Stroke order diagrams accompany each
entry in this book. The accompanying material, in addition, provides an
animated graphic showing each character being written in its proper order.
An Overview of On-yomi and Kun-yomi
On-yomi and kun-yomi are the two main branches of pronunciation (or
“readings”, as they are called) that are present in modern day Japanese. On-
yomi are sometimes called the “Chinese readings” of the kanji, as these were
the initial pronunciations attached to the characters when they first arrived
from China. The kun-yomi, on the other hand, developed from within Japan,
and are thus referred to as “Japanese readings”. This, along with the fact that
different on-yomi for the same character sometimes arrived from China
centuries later, helps explain how a single kanji in Japanese can sometimes

have more than one of each type of reading.
Clearly, memorizing these various pronunciations and knowing when to
use them are two of the most difficult tasks in learning Japanese. There are,
however, reasons to be optimistic. Over 60% of the kanji have only a single
on-yomi, or one on-yomi and one kun-yomi. In addition, when multiple on-
or kun-yomi are present, there is usually only one dominant reading for each.
This book will help you determine the most important pronunciations to be
learned by classifying every reading as either “common” or “less common”.
Those less common do not merit being learned at this stage of your language
study; they are presented only for future reference.
An interesting aspect of Japanese (and an unlucky one for us in this
volume!) is that the most complex kanji in terms of pronunciation are often
amongst the most simple to write. Do not get discouraged, therefore, when
thorny characters such as “person” (Entry 2), “one” (Entry 3), “sun” (Entry
6), and “large” (Entry 17) all show up in the first chapter, as these can be
classified with the most difficult in the language. Be patient with such
characters, and take comfort in knowing that by the time you finish this book
you will have dealt with the trickiest entries in the entire range of the general-
use kanji.
Some Rules for Using On-yomi and Kun-yomi
There are some useful ground rules that you should keep in mind when
learning to read single kanji and compounds (words formed from several
kanji put together):
1.   Kanji in most compounds are usually read with their on-yomi. Note,
incidentally, that when the pronunciations for on-yomi are given, these
are conventionally written in katakana, and indicated by uppercase letters
in English.

2.   Compounds only rarely mix on-yomi and kun-yomi. Note here that kun-
yomi are conventionally written in hiragana, and indicated by lowercase
letters in English.

4. Kanji that appear alone (that is, they are not part of a compound in a
sentence) are usually read with their kunyomi.

You may have noticed words such as “usually” and “almost always” in
the above rules. One thing you will soon learn about kanji is that they seem to
take delight in turning up exceptions to every rule. The best thing to do is
make use of these exceptions as a means to memorize the words in which
they appear. Put another way, you will be much further ahead if you learn to
love headstrong words that live by their own rules!
Voiced and Unvoiced Sounds
An important consideration in learning to read Japanese is understanding the
difference between voiced and unvoiced consonant sounds. Think of this
difference by saying aloud the English words “brink” and “bring”; the “k” of
“brink” is unvoiced, while the “g” of “bring” is voiced (you need to vibrate
your vocal cords to say it). This is the same distinction, for example, between
the Japanese sounds “ka” and “ga” (か and が). What you need to know is
that certain kanji can turn from being unvoiced to voiced, depending on
where they appear in a compound. The first entry under Table 1 above
provides an example: the unvoiced on-yomi SAN (サン) changes to the
voiced ZAN (ザン) in the first sample word shown. Although there are an
assortment of rules that explain when such changes take place, it is best to

develop a “feel” for when these phonetic transformations might occur. Once
this happens, your ear will develop to the point where certain compounds
begin sounding more natural with one of their kanji voiced.
Irregular Readings
It sometimes occurs in Japanese that a kanji compound has an irregular
reading. Known as jukujikun, such readings have no relation to the normal
on- or kun-yomi of their component kanji. Rather, these irregular readings
are assigned to entire compounds rather than to their component kanji.
You will encounter the first of these in Entry 2. In all three such irregular
readings shown there, the reading of the kanji “人” is completely different
from what we would expect it to be normally. In a sense, this is much like the
problem foreigners face when learning English; the pronunciation of the
word “cough”, for example, has little connection with the normal sound of
the letters from which it is made. Fortunately there are not many irregular
readings to be learned (less than thirty appear in this book), but as they are all
in common use it is best to come to grips with them the moment they are
encountered, by memorizing them as individual words. All irregular readings
in this book will be presented separately from the “Common words and
compounds” section, to make it clear that these are some truly oddball
pronunciations.
A Method for Memorizing the Visual and Aural Aspects
of Kanji
As we have seen, kanji are typically more visually complex than hiragana and
katakana. Because of this, a good way to simplify the task of committing
kanji to memory is to look at their constituent parts. We will do just that,
breaking the characters down piece-by-piece and assigning meanings to these
components based exclusively on how they look. When these various
components then join together to build kanji, we will make use of short
stories featuring the pieces as “actors”, accompanied by drawings to help
solidify the appearance of the characters in a unique way. This part of our
memorization approach, therefore, will focus exclusively on the visual aspect
of each kanji.

For the aural side of the equation, we need to take one other difference
between the on- and kun-yomi into account when devising our memorization
strategy: there are far fewer on-yomi to learn than kun-yomi. This is because
on-yomi are not often complete words on their own – it helps to think of
them as short “blocks” of sound that in most cases form words only when
they are strung together. (It is worth keeping in mind, though, that the kanji
for numbers are a notable exception to this). Given that roughly 300 on-yomi
suffice to cover the entire range of Japan’s 1,945 general-use characters, a
single reading can be attached to many different kanji. SHŌ (ショウ), for
example, is an on-yomi for more that 60 characters. We will be taking
advantage of this aspect of Japanese to cut down on the work involved in
memorizing these readings.
Our basic plan for committing both the on-yomi and kunyomi to memory
will be to come up with English keywords that approximate their sounds as
closely as possible, and to use these in sentences that also contain a word
encompassing the general meaning of the character.
As an example, the kanji for “two” has an on-yomi of NI (ニ), and a
kun-yomi of futa (ふた). If we choose the word “knee” to suggest NI, and
the phrase “who tans” for futa, a possible sentence might be the following:
“TWO knees? Who tans only those?”. This second side to our approach,
therefore, will focus exclusively on the aural aspect of a kanji.
A useful shortcut will involve using the same on-yomi keyword every
time a kanji having that reading appears (recall that many kanji can share the
same on-yomi). In the preceding example, therefore, the word “knee” will be
used each time a kanji with the on-yomi “NI” crops up, and will simply be
combined with the different kun-yomi and meaning of the new kanji. A
major advantage of this approach is that it will make easily confused on-
yomi such as HŌ (ホウ) and HO (ホ) absolutely distinctive in your mind,
as you will have assigned different keywords to each of these. Given their
importance (they will need to be used over and over again with different
kanji), the creation of on-yomi keywords will be left up to you once a few
examples have been provided at the beginning of Chapter 1 – your sentences
will be more memorable if these words have a distinct personal meaning for
you. The On-Yomi Keyword Table at the end of the book will help you
manage your list of these keywords as it grows, and is designed to be filled in

as you encounter each on-yomi in the pages ahead. By keeping all these
readings in one place, you can refer to them quickly when needed.
The kun-yomi, on the other hand, are far greater in number, and therefore
best learned individually. Fortunately, they tend to be more distinctive than
the on-yomi, and are, as a result, often easier to remember once a unique
keyword phrase has been created. In order to help with the workload in this
respect, suggestions for kun-yomi keywords are provided with each kanji
throughout the book. But you should not hesitate to use an idea of your own
should one spring immediately to mind.
Presentation of the Entries In This Book
Each entry will offer one kanji along with a word embracing its broadest
possible meaning, followed by a grid showing its stroke order. Next, you’ll
see a list of the components making up the character, together with reference
numbers indicating the points at which these have been introduced earlier in
the book. After a short background section describes the various shades of
meaning the character conveys, a story (when required) and illustration are
presented to help you memorize the kanji visually. A pronunciation section
then lists the most common on- and kun-yomi for the character followed by
readings that you will encounter less frequently. Entries conclude with a
section showing the character’s use in a number of common Japanese words,
and a sample sentence in which the kanji is featured. Where space permits, a
table for writing practice is also included.
There is an important point to keep in mind with respect to the “Common
words and compounds” table in each entry: any word or compound consisting
of kanji you have already learned will be shown in bold face and in a larger
font than the other kanji in the table. This will allow you to focus on
reviewing those words you have previously encountered. One useful way to
review would involve covering up the right-hand columns in the table with
your hand or a piece of paper, then drawing it back to reveal the individual
kanji meanings, pronunciation, and the overall meaning of the word in
question.
In order to make your task a bit more manageable – you’ll be mastering
200 of the most important kanji in Japanese, after all! – the book is divided
into chapters of 20 entries each. This will allow you to periodically review a

reasonable number of characters before proceeding onward. Short review
sections at the end of each chapter will help you check your learning, along
with cumulative exercises following Chapters 5 and 10. Use these reviews to
see exactly how far you’ve come in your mastery of the kanji, and to find out
which entries to return to for more practice, if you need it. You’ll find answer
keys, along with indices listing kanji by stroke count, on-yomi, kun-yomi,
and English meaning, at the end of the book. Remember that all of the on-
yomi are presented in katakana and employ upper-case Roman letters for
romaji. The kun-yomi are written with hiragana, and have lower-case Roman
letters for romaji.
To add an audio aspect to your kanji learning, the accompanying material
contains pronunciations for all the on- and kun-yomi found in this book, as
well as for the sample sentences and common words in each entry; it will be
particularly useful in helping you to select your on-yomi keywords. An
animated graphic is also provided to show you how each kanji is written
using the proper stroke order.
Learning to read kanji is fascinating; the characters, so different from
those used in our own writing system, have a mysterious quality that attracts
everyone who studies Japanese. As you progress through this book and see
how kanji are easily able to present even the most complex ideas, it is worth
keeping in mind that you are not only setting out to learn a new means of
written communication, but another way of conceptualizing the world around
you. It’s an exciting task, and by using the present book as your guide you
will find this process to be not only interesting, but fun. So let’s jump right in
– and start mastering Japanese kanji!

meaning is obvious at a glance. As kanji such as these are best learned from a
simple picture, there is no need for an accompanying story. A number of
characters in the book will fall into this category.
COMMON PRONUNCIATIONS
Common ON reading: SAN (サン)
Common kun reading: yama (やま)
This kanji has only one on-yomi and one kun-yomi (the pronunciation of
which – together with all others in this book – can be heard on the
accompanying material). To suggest these sounds, let’s use the word

“SANDWICH” for SAN, and “yam attack” for yama. As “sandwich” will
now be a permanent keyword for all kanji sharing the reading SAN, turn to
the on-yomi table in the back of the book and write “Sandwich” in the space
next to SAN. Remember that only on-yomi (not kun-yomi) should be
entered in the table.
We now need to link the meaning of the kanji to its sounds by using the
words “mountain”, “sandwich”, and “yam attack” in a sentence. Let’s try
this: “On the Mountain I had a yam attack, so I ate a SANDWICH”. For
future review, write this sentence in the box below.
Now for some common words that make use of this kanji. There’s no need to
worry for the moment about being unable to recognize the other characters,
as they will all be learned over the course of the book; at this stage, try to see
how the meanings of individual kanji combine to form more complex words
(look especially at the fourth example below). This is a useful skill, as it will
help foster an intuitive feel for the meanings of unfamiliar compounds that
you encounter in the future. It is also one of the most rewarding aspects of
learning to read the language. Understanding the logic that went into the
formation of a compound not only makes it easier to remember, but offers
fascinating insight into the minds of the people who devised it hundreds – if
not thousands – of years earlier.
Remember that the uppercase letters and katakana here indicate on-yomi,
with lowercase letters and hiragana indicating kun-yomi. Recall as well
from the introduction that this is our first instance of a character whose
unvoiced reading can sometimes become voiced (in examples 3 - 4, where
the on-yomi changes from SAN to ZAN). Note how the first entry below is
presented in bold face — indicating that this is a word you now know.

= There are no trees on the mountain.

KANJI 2
人 PERSON
MEANING
Person/Human being. Another visually simple kanji for which no story is
required. When appearing at the end of country names, this kanji denotes an
individual’s nationality.
COMMON PRONUNCIATIONS
Common ON reading: JIN (ジン); NIN (ニン)
Common kun reading: hito (ひと)
As mentioned in the introduction, 人 is a character that challenges every
student of Japanese. As there are few patterns to its distribution of readings,
words containing it often need to be memorized individually. JIN, however,
tends to signify that a person belongs to a certain subgroup of humanity,
while NIN indicates a person engaged in an activity specified by the kanji
preceding it. Look for JIN in the first position and at the end of words
signifying countries, and be aware that the kun-yomi is always voiced
(changes from hito to bito) when it appears outside of the first position, as it

does in the sixth compound below.
We now need our keywords and sentence for the three readings. For JIN
and NIN let’s choose “JEANS” and “NINCOMPOOP”. As you did in the
previous entry for 山, turn to the on-yomi table at the end of the book, but
this time write “Jeans” in the space next to JIN and “Nincompoop” in the
space next to NIN. For the kun-yomi “hito” we’ll use “heat open”. We can
now throw everything together into the sentence “That Person is a
NINcompoop because they heat open their JEANS”. Remember to write this
sentence in the box below so that you can review it later.
Here are our initial encounters with irregular readings. Note that the irregular
reading in the first two examples belongs to 人; as you will learn in the next
two entries, “一” and “二” are read with their normal kun-yomi. In the final
compound, both readings are irregular. All three of these words are best
thought of as special cases, and memorized individually.

KANJI 3
一 ONE
MEANING
One. It’s hard to find an easier kanji to remember than this!
REMEMBERING THIS KANJI
Despite its simplicity, we need to complicate things a little in order to
make use of this character in other kanji. As a result, this character will
mean the “top of a hamburger bun” when appearing over all other parts of
another character, and the “bottom of a hamburger bun” when it shows up
beneath them. But what of a horizontal line found in the middle of a
character? Well, that would be the patty (which vegetarians may wish to
picture being made of tofu).
“In the beginning, there was ONE shapeless… bun.”
COMMON PRONUNCIATIONS
Common ON readings: ICHI (イチ); ITSU (イツ)
Common kun reading: hito (ひと)
Though this is the simplest kanji in a visual sense, knowing when to use
which of its readings can be tricky. Now that we have some understanding of
the difference between voiced and unvoiced consonant sounds, however, it’s
much easier for us to make sense of it all. Basically, whenever this kanji

appears as the first character in a compound it is almost always read with its
on-yomi, and its pronunciation of ICHI or ITSU will depend on whether the
initial sound of the following kanji is voiced or voiceless (look closely at the
sixth compound of the common words section below to see how the sound of
ITSU “doubles up” with the sound of the next kanji in this situation). Don’t
worry if this sounds complicated for now; rest assured it will soon become
intuitive as compounds begin sounding more natural with one reading or the
other.
We now need a sentence with all three common readings together with
the word “one”. To suggest the sounds ICHI and ITSU, let’s use “EACH
EEL” and “EAT SOUP”. Write these in their respective places in the on-
yomi table at the back of the book. For the kun-yomi “hito”, we’ll use “he
told”. Let’s choose the following sentence: “One,” he told us, “EACH EEL
must EAT SOUP.” As before, write this sentence in the box below for future
reference.
LESS COMMON PRONUNCIATIONS
Less common ON reading: none
Less common kun reading: none
Here is another irregular reading; the word “day” appears in brackets to make
the logic behind the compound clearer by indicating a secondary meaning of
日 (Entry 6).
IRREGULAR READING
一日
one + sun (day)
= first day of the month
tsuitachi
ついたち
Note that the same compound is shown below with a different
pronunciation and meaning. Context will determine which is the appropriate
reading to apply; when 一日 is seen at the top of a newspaper page, for
example, it clearly refers to the first day of the month and would thus be read

“tsuitachi” (つ いたち).

MEANING
All things to do with two, including the ideas of “double” and “bi-”, etc. Note
that the top line is drawn slightly shorter.
REMEMBERING THIS KANJI
On day TWO, things began to emerge in the form of a hamburger-like
object.
COMMON PRONUNCIATIONS
Common ON reading: NI (ニ)
Common kun reading: futa (ふた)
After that bruising encounter with the pronunciation of 一, things become
much simpler with 二, although as you can see below there are also three
irregular readings that need to be learned with this character. To suggest our
on-yomi, let’s use “KNEE”, and for our kun-yomi, “who tans”. After

entering KNEE in your on-yomi table, write the following sentence in the
box below: “Two KNEES? Who tans only those?”
LESS COMMON PRONUNCIATIONS

Here are three irregular readings that will be frequently encountered. The
final kanji in the third example (歳), incidentally, is not covered in this book;
such characters will be included only when they form common words in
which the pronunciation of the character we are considering has an irregular
reading. Irregular readings containing these kanji will be identified with an
asterisk (*).

MEANING

REMEMBERING THIS KANJI
On day THREE, the full hamburger - in all its glory - came into being.
COMMON PRONUNCIATIONS
Common ON reading: SAN (サン)
Common kun reading: none
It’s now time to begin making use of our key shortcut for learning the on-
yomi. As we have already created a keyword for SAN (recall the on-yomi for
“山” in Entry 1), we will now use that same word here. Let’s keep things
simple and have “Three SANDWICHES” as our phrase. As always, write

this in the box below.
LESS COMMON PRONUNCIATIONS
Less common ON reading: none
Less common kun readings: mi- (みっ); mi (み)
Here we have our first examples of some less common readings, in this case
the two kun-yomi “mi-” and “mi”. Keep in mind that “less common” does
not equate with “unimportant,” as to read Japanese fluently these
pronunciations will all have
to be learned in time. At this stage, however, it is far more useful to
solidify the common readings in your memory and take up the others when
they are encountered in the future. When you reach that stage, the appropriate
phrase for the respective kanji (e.g. “Three SANDWICHES”) can simply be
extended to accommodate additional mnemonic words.
In the present example, the first kun-yomi appears in only two words,
and always “doubles up” in the same way “ITSU” (the on-yomi for “一”)
does when preceding voiceless consonant sounds (this is indicated by the
short dash after mi). In a sense, this reading is unusual enough to merit the
words being learned as if they were irregular readings: 三日 [mik·ka
(みっ·か)] “the third day of the month”, and 三つ [mit·tsu (みっ·つ)]
the general counter for “three”. The second less common reading is more
typical of the pronunciations you will find in this section. The words in which
it occurs are obscure; it is enough to be aware that such less common
readings exist for some of the kanji in this book, but that you don’t need to
worry about them for now.

KANJI 6
日 SUN
MEANING
This is a kanji with two primary meanings that are clearly related: “sun” and
“day”. The character will become most familiar to you through its use in the
days of the week, and as the initial kanji in the compound for Japan.
This is another character, incidentally, for which we do not need to make
use of a story.
COMMON PRONUNCIATIONS
Common ON readings: NICHI (ニチ); JITSU (ジツ)
Common kun reading: hi (ひ)
日 is another example of a simple-looking kanji that can cause a bit of
trouble when it comes to pronunciation. As all three of these readings occur
frequently, the best approach is to look for patterns: NICHI will be
encountered overwhelmingly in the first position (hi makes only a few
appearances), JITSU in the second, and hi in the third – where it becomes
voiced and pronounced bi (び). A perfect example of this odd behavior can

be seen in the word Sunday, the final example below. Note also that NICHI
acts like ITSU (from 一) by doubling up any unvoiced consonant sounds
that follow it, as can be seen in the more formal rendering of the
pronunciation for “Japan”, NIP·PON (ニッ·ポン), from which the more
common NI·HON (ニ·ホン) has been derived.
At this point we will now start building our own sentences to memorize
pronunciations. First, think of a word to approximate the on-yomi NICHI (a
German philosoper, perhaps?) and the on-yomi JITSU (a martial art,
maybe?). Whichever words you decide to use, don’t forget to write them in
the on-yomi table at the back of the book. When it comes to the kun-yomi,
suggestions will be provided for each one ahead (they can be tough to dream
up at times). Don’t hesitate, however, to use your own ideas if another word
springs immediately to mind. For the present character, try “helium”; use this
together with “sun” and your on-yomi keywords to create the sentence you
will write in the box below.
LESS COMMON PRONUNCIATIONS

Less common kun reading: ka (か)
ka is used only to identify the days of the month from 2-10, 14, 17, 20, 24

character in this book). You’ve already seen the first.

COMPONENT 7
JELLY BEAN
Here we have our initial “component”. These will always be introduced
directly before the first character in which they appear, and will be set
apart in a separate text box to indicate that they are not themselves kanji on
their own.
This little guy, incidentally, can appear at various places and on various
angles in a kanji. It can also show up with not only one friend, as in Entry
60, but with two, as in Entry 25.
KANJI 7
白 WHITE
MEANING
White. To the Japanese, this color symbolizes cleanliness and purity (which
helps explain the presence of so many white cars in the country!). As a result,
the kanji can appear in words with this shade of meaning. The fourth
compound is an example.
REMEMBERING THIS KANJI
As this kanji is composed of a separate character and a component, our
first story will help you to memorize it:

I think it’s safe to say that any jelly bean, no matter what color it is,
will turn WHITE if thrown into the sun.

KANJI 8
口 MOUTH
MEANING
Along with the literal meaning of “mouth” and things oral, the kanji also
relates to openings in general, from caves and harbors to taps and bottles, for
instance.
REMEMBERING THIS KANJI
Has there ever been a more famous MOUTH than that of Dracula? We
will use this image of a vampire to suggest the word “mouth” in our stories
from now on; a few other simple characters will be treated like this as
well.

COMPONENT 9
PRISON
Though it looks similar to the kanji for “mouth”, this component is larger
and always completely surrounds whatever happens to be inside it (like a
prison should!); this difference can be seen clearly in Entry 9.
KANJI 9
回 ROTATE
MEANING
Here we see the difference between the “prison” component and the kanji for
“mouth”. Note that the interior part of this kanji is written following the first
two strokes of the prison walls, and becomes enclosed by the final stroke at
the bottom. All characters of this type have the same pattern.
The general sense of this kanji relates to the ideas of rotation and going
around in both space and time. It can also refer to the vicinity of things
(neighborhoods and surroundings, etc), and is well-known to Japanese
baseball fans as the character used to denote innings.
REMEMBERING THIS KANJI
It was a great relief for everyone when the vampire was finally put in
prison. It soon became obvious, though, that he could not be kept with the

rest of the cons; his offer to “ROTATE the blood” of everyone made them
suspicious. The end result, as might be expected, was solitary confinement,
a bad enough development for the vampire that became even worse when
he turned into a bat; flying in endless ROTATIONS apparently brought on
some nasty dizzy spells.

Less common ON reading: none
Less common kun reading: none
This is a good place to highlight another important aspect of Japanese: the
difference between intransitive (intr) and transitive (tr) verbs. Basically, an
intransitive verb does not require an object, whereas a transitive verb does.
This can be more easily understood by comparing the first two examples

given below; a person or thing “goes around” on their own (intransitive), but
must have an object to “send around” (transitive). As many Japanese verbs
come in such intransitive/transitive pairs (the same kanji accompanied by
different hiragana attached to the end), it is worth noticing how certain
endings often indicate the type of verb; for “-ru/-su” pairs such as in the
example here, the -su verb will always be the transitive.

COMPONENT 10
BALLET
We’ll be using this component to mean anything to do with the world of
ballet.
KANJI 10
四 FOUR
MEANING
Four/Quad-, etc. Recall what was noted in Entry 9 regarding the proper
stroke order for such characters: the inner part is written after the first two
strokes of the prison walls, and enclosed by the final line at the bottom.
REMEMBERING THIS KANJI
Look, I’m not able to say for certain why they threw the ballet dancer into
prison, but I do know one thing: they didn’t break him. How could I tell?
Well, every afternoon during our exercise period, while the rest of us
inmates were either pumping iron or sharpening our shivs, there he’d be,
dancing to the FOUR corners of the prison walls. We all respected him
for it, I suppose; not a single con in those FOUR corners ever laughed at
his tights.

COMMON PRONUNCIATIONS
Common ON reading: SHI (シ)
Common kun readings: yon (よん); yo (よ)
Do not choose the word “SHE” for your on-yomi, as we will be needing it far
more for kun-yomi, and a word less abstract (try to think of things, places or
people) will always be more memorable and make your sentences easier to
create. As you can see from the examples below, this character has a
tendency to appear in compounds having a mix of kun-yomi and on-yomi;
this makes it a little trickier than the other kanji for numbers.
kun-yomi suggestions: “lie only”; “yodel”
Create your on-yomi keyword and enter it in the table at the back of the

These words are best learned as if they were ateji.

KANJI 11
月 MOON
MEANING
As with the kanji for “sun”, this character carries two meanings that are
clearly related, in this case “moon” and “month”. You will become very
familiar with this kanji through its use in the names of the months. This is
another visually simple character for which no story is required.
COMMON PRONUNCIATIONS
Common ON readings: GETSU (ゲツ); GATSU (ガツ)
Common kun reading: tsuki (つき)
Like ITSU (with the kanji “一”) and other readings ending in “-TSU”, the
two on-yomi double up any unvoiced consonant sounds that follow. You will
encounter GATSU primarily in the names of the months.
kun-yomi suggestion: “bought Sioux keepsakes”

“I’m far more BRIGHT than you are,” said the moon.
“Really?” answered the sun, smiling. “I find that hard to believe. I’m
so BRIGHT people have to wear shades; how many people do you notice
wearing moonglasses.”
The moon looked confused. “What are you talking about?” he said.
“There’s no such thing as moonglasses.”
“You know,” sighed the sun, “you’re even less BRIGHT than I

COMMON PRONUNCIATIONS
Common ON readings: MOKU (モク); BOKU (ボク)

This is another kanji that will require patience to learn. Look for MOKU to
show up in the first position, however, and BOKU in the second. ki occurs
less often, but appears with equal frequency in the first or second position.
kun-yomi suggestion: “keel” (do not use “key”, as this will have far more
value as an on-yomi keyword).

KANJI 15
目 EYE
MEANING
The general meaning is eye. An important secondary usage of the character,
however, can be seen when it comes at the end of a number compound such
as in the third example below. In these instances it is read with its kun-yomi
and indicates the “-th” suffix in words such as “fourth” and “seventh” (it also
expresses the related endings of “first”, “second” and “third” in such
compounds).
REMEMBERING THIS KANJI
In the interests of full disclosure, it should be said that the Cyclops lobbied
long and hard to be this book’s representative for “EYE”. Well, it looks
like his efforts – which included a few thoughtfully chosen gifts – have
paid off. Cyclops, you have been placed on an equal footing with Dracula!
COMMON PRONUNCIATIONS
Common ON reading: MOKU (モク)

Large/Big. The meanings of “important” and “great (not always in a positive
sense)” can also be implied in words containing this kanji.
REMEMBERING THIS KANJI
Not many things are LARGER than a sumo wrestler, so we’ll use this
image as our connection to the character from now on.
COMMON PRONUNCIATIONS
Common ON readings: DAI (ダイ); TAI (タイ)
Common kun reading: ō (おお)
As DAI and TAI occur with equal frequency (ō much less often) when this
kanji appears in the first position, this character presents a special challenge
for students of Japanese. When it occupies other positions in a compound,

however, DAI is far and away the more common reading.

MEANING
A versatile character that expresses the ideas of “middle”, “medium”, and
“average”, etc. This kanji can also serve as an abbreviation for China; “日”
is used as the equivalent with respect to Japan.
REMEMBERING THIS KANJI
I approached the sleeping vampire with the pole shaking in my hands: it
was now or never. Raising the weapon over his feet I prepared to bring it
down, but at the last moment the master’s words came back: “How many
times must we go over this? Drive it through the MIDDLE of the
vampire! The MIDDLE!” Yes, I thought, placing the pole over the
vampire’s stomach, it would all go perfectly now.

the 1880’s) was one of the EIGHT wonders of the ancient world.”

CHAPTER 2 (KANJI 21-40)
KANJI 21
貝 SHELLFISH
MEANING
Shellfish/Seashell. As the lack of common words and compounds in the table
indicates, this is not the most useful character to learn for its own sake. It
often appears as a component in other kanji, however, and for this reason
needs to be learned here.
REMEMBERING THIS KANJI
Celebrating his inclusion in this book, the Cyclops decided to throw an
enormous SHELLFISH barbecue for all his friends. Minotaurs, griffins,
nymphs and satyrs… even the sirens showed up (after agreeing to refrain
from singing, of course). It was quite a crowd, but the grill the Cyclops
stretched over a nearby volcano was more than enough to accommodate
the food. And what a variety of SHELLFISH there was! Oysters, mussels,
abalone, scallops…everyone agreed it was the best spread since Zeus’
clambake on Mt. Etna.

COMMON PRONUNCIATIONS
Common ON reading: none
Common kun reading: kai (かい)
This character is always unvoiced (kai) in the first position, and becomes
voiced (gai) elsewhere.
kun-yomi suggestion: “Kaiser roll”. If you are choosing your own keywords
for the kun-yomi, do not use the same word you selected for KAI (カイ),
the on-yomi for “回” in Entry 9; it is best to keep the two types of readings
separate. Create your sentence to remember the kun-yomi reading in the box
below.

玉 JEWEL
MEANING
This character appears in the names of a variety of precious stones, including
the compounds for rubies, sapphires, and emeralds. It also incorporates the
sense of a “ball-like” object, a meaning evident in the final examples below.
Take note of the correct stroke order for this kanji (“King” + “Jelly
bean”); the three horizontal lines are not written first.
REMEMBERING THIS KANJI
“I wish to reward you for your faithful service,” the king said to his
minister. “There is a jelly bean for you at my feet; you may take it if you
wish.” The man was a little confused by this, of course, until he bent down
and saw a JEWEL shaped like a jelly bean next to the king’s shoes.
“You might not want to eat that,” smiled the king. “After all, JEWELS
aren’t particularly tasty.”

meaning, be it the actual physical organ, the sense of “feelings”, or the
concept of something’s “core”.
REMEMBERING THIS KANJI
There are a couple of ways to capture a HEART. The first is by using
kindness; giving gifts such as a trio of jelly beans is an example of this
method. The second is to simply use a hook.

COMMON PRONUNCIATIONS
Common ON reading: SHIN (シン)

国 COUNTRY
MEANING
Think of “country” here in the sense of a nation state.
REMEMBERING THIS KANJI
Most folks will state that their COUNTRY is like a jewel, one that must
be protected from external dangers. And so they build walls. But is there a
difference between being protected and being in prison? It’s a thorny
question, but perhaps the philosopher Epicurus answered it best: “There
may be a jewel of a COUNTRY within prison walls somewhere, but I’d
be willing to bet they’d have lousy food.”

UMBRELLA
KANJI 27
全 COMPLETE
MEANING
This kanji expresses the idea of wholeness and completion. Note in the
sample compounds how both the first and third entries can have different
connotations. Although the context will usually make the meaning clear, such
ambiguity is a common feature of Japanese.
REMEMBERING THIS KANJI
“You might imagine that the king’s umbrella bearer has a job that even a
COMPLETE idiot could do. Well, you’re wrong, because you’d better not
let the king get wet. Sadly, I learned this the hard way, for one afternoon
the umbrella I chose had a hole, and a drop of moisture sprinkled the
king’s robe. That was enough to leave me dangling in the dungeon for a
week. A tyrant king, you say? Perhaps, but the lesson I learned that day
has remained with me forever: the umbrella must COMPLETELY cover
the king.”

COMMON PRONUNCIATIONS
Common ON reading: ZEN (ゼン)
Common kun reading: none
Given that “Zen” (as in Buddhism) is one of the few Japanese words to have
entered the English language, feel free to take advantage of this by using it to
remember this reading. For the sentence, then, you might employ some Zen-
like simplicity: “Complete ZEN”.

MEANING
Ten. The first two examples of Entry 176 show another use for this character,
an interesting application based entirely on its shape.
REMEMBERING THIS KANJI
This is another simple character for which we will assign an external
meaning: scarecrow.
In case you’re wondering why this particular scarecrow was chosen,
the answer is simple: he was rated a perfect TEN in terms of style and
poise.

KANJI 29
早 EARLY
MEANING
Early/Fast. It is important to remember that this kanji expresses both of these
ideas.
REMEMBERING THIS KANJI
There isn’t much a scarecrow can do for exercise, but ours is determined
to stay in shape. How so? Well, EARLY each day, once the sun is up,
he’ll launch into a vigorous routine of finger stretches, toe curls, and head
rolls. As it’s too hot to do this later on, it’s fortunate he’s an EARLY riser.

COMPONENT 30
GOOD FIGURE SKATER
A good figure skater always keeps her leg straight in this position.
KANJI 30
上 UPPER
MEANING
This simple-looking character expresses a broad range of ideas relating to the
words “upper”, “on”, and “over”, among others; it can refer to anything from
goods of high quality to superiors at work. It’s a fascinating kanji that is
widely used, and one that rewards patient study.
REMEMBERING THIS KANJI
Look at the beautiful posture, with the outstretched leg held perfectly
straight; this is a good figure skater with complete confidence in her
abilities, skating as if the ice were the bottom of a bun that would not hurt
her if she fell. This is clearly an UPPER-class athlete.

COMMON PRONUNCIATIONS
Common ON reading: JŌ (ジョウ)
Common kun readings: kami (かみ); ue (うえ); nobo (のぼ); a (あ);
uwa (うわ)
Take a deep breath, as this kanji contains the second largest number of
common readings for any character you will encounter in Japanese (you
won’t have long to wait for the one with the most!). The on-yomi JŌ,
however, is by far the most frequently used, and the kun-yomi readings will
often appear with hiragana accompaniment (which will offer a clue as to
which pronunciation should be used for the kanji).
The verb a·geru (あ·げる) in example 5 below, incidentally, is almost
always used in a transitive sense (that is, it “lifts” some object in either a
physical or symbolic way), and is best thought of as being paired with the
intransitive a·garu (あ·がる).
Before proceeding with your sentence, it is useful now to consider one of
the most important benefits of the on-yomi table: because you will have
chosen different keywords for each of the readings, there will be no danger of
confusing pronunciations differing only in their use of a “long” versus
“short” vowel sound. We encounter the first example of this here, with JŌ
sounding much like JO (the on-yomi for “女” in Entry 16), but needing to
be memorized as a separate reading.
kun-yomi suggestions: “make a meal”; “true age”; “no bones”; “anaconda”;
“new wok”

COMPONENT 31
POOR FIGURE SKATER
A poor figure skater lets her leg droop in this position.
KANJI 31
下 LOWER
MEANING
This obvious partner to the preceding kanji expresses a similarly wide range
of ideas, with words in this case relating to the notions of “lower”, “under”,
and “below”.
REMEMBERING THIS KANJI
No doubt about it: figure skating crowds are tough, and will not tolerate
LOWER-class skaters. In one competition, all it took was a poor figure
skater’s drooping leg to make the audience hurl the tops of their buns at
her in disgust.

COMMON PRONUNCIATIONS
Common ON readings: KA (カ); GE (ゲ)
Common kun readings: shita (した); shimo (しも); o (お); sa (さ);
kuda (くだ)
Here it is: the kanji with the most common readings of all. Although it can be
a bit of work trying to come to grips with this character’s many angles, keep
in mind that the final three kun-yomi above are all verb stems, and will thus
be accompanied by hiragana hinting at the correct pronunciation. When it
comes to the readings used for compounds, KA or GE will be encountered
far more than the others, although there are no easily discernible patterns as
to when each of these is used.
This kanji illustrates well the difference between intransitive/transitive
verb pairs. Refer back to “早” and “上” (Entries 29 and 30). Notice a
similarity between the verbs presented there and examples four and five
shown here.
kun-yomi suggestions: “she tackled”; “she moped”; “orangutan”; “sat”;
“barracuda”

COMPONENT 32
RABBIT
KANJI 32
米 RICE
MEANING
(Uncooked) rice. As can be seen in the last five compounds below, this
character is used, curiously, to symbolize the Americas (recall how 中 is
used in a similar way for China, and 日 for Japan). Note how the fourth
example combines two such characters; this occurs frequently in written
Japanese.
REMEMBERING THIS KANJI
Interesting fact: Japan has the equivalent of an Easter Bunny! The
difference is that this rabbit will sneak around behind trees until he can
dart out and hide RICE for children to find. Unfortunately, as the grains
are really small and a lot less interesting than colored eggs, many kids
have grown bored with the custom. As a result of this, the tradition of the
Japanese RICE rabbit is not well-known today.

COMMON PRONUNCIATIONS
Common ON readings: MAI (マイ); BEI (ベイ)
Common kun reading: kome (こめ)
BEI is used as the reading in compounds when this kanji relates to the
Americas, with MAI the primary choice when it refers to rice.

KANJI 33
自 SELF
MEANING
This character conveys the important idea of self. Its function becomes
clearer if you think of such English words as “self-confidence” and “self-
government”. When these and other words beginning with “self-” are
translated into Japanese, the resulting compound will usually begin with this
kanji.
REMEMBERING THIS KANJI
Everyone is aware of a Cyclops’ weakness for jelly beans. It was this, in
fact, that saved Hercules; dangling a jelly bean over the Cyclops’ head
was enough to make the monster drop his club and lose all sense of SELF.
“It was sad, actually,” Hercules said at a later press conference.
“No SELF-respecting Cyclops should act that way. He needs more
SELF-control.”

“You can know nothing of the gorilla’s ways unless you are INSIDE its
world. To truly understand, each person must get INSIDE an Acme™
gorilla suit – available for a limited time at this low introductory price –
and head immediately into the jungle. It is then a simple matter of being
accepted by a gorilla pod; once this has been done, a person can delve
easily INSIDE the consciousness of our greatest primate.”

MEANING
Right/Right-hand side.
REMEMBERING THIS KANJI
Vampires are extremely RIGHT wing, demanding unconditional
obedience to their authority and strict adherence to traditional ways. Even
superheroes can turn to the RIGHT under their hypnotic influence; they
invariably develop a tougher stance on crime and become less likely to
wear skin-tight costumes.

connotation through its appearance in words such as “lust” and “sensuality”.
REMEMBERING THIS KANJI
“What is really inside a person?” Troubled by this question, I embarked
on an extended spiritual quest that eventually led me to a remote
Himalayan summit. There I fasted, growing weak and delirious until a
talking leopard appeared one day and laid a paw on my shoulder. “What
are you, nuts?” it said. “Take it from me: there’s nothing but MEAT in
there.”

春 SPRING
MEANING
This elegant-looking character refers to the season of spring. Interestingly, it
also carries a hint of sexuality and amorousness, a meaning apparent by its
presence in the Japanese word for “puberty”, as well as in one of the
compounds below. Make sure in writing this kanji to follow the order of the
components as they are listed above (three + person + sun).
REMEMBERING THIS KANJI
It’s doubtful any person looks forward to SPRING more than I do. As a
matter of fact, on the first day of the season you’ll surely see me in the
backyard before dawn, firing up my barbecue to make the most enormous
full hamburger possible. And why do I do that? Well, it’s simple: I’m a

CHAPTER 3 (KANJI 41-60)
KANJI 41
京 CAPITAL
MEANING
Think of “capital” in the sense of a large metropolis. Though it’s not the most
common of characters, it is useful to learn this kanji because of its appearance
in the compound for Tokyo and other cities.
REMEMBERING THIS KANJI
The CAPITAL can be a pretty intimidating place if you don’t know it, and
as a police officer here I’m always having to help folks with directions.
Even vampires, who normally wouldn’t go near anyone in a police
uniform, come up to me now and then. It’s not surprising, I suppose, that
they’re overwhelmed by all the buildings and traffic after having come
from such small Transylvanian villages. But then, it’s only natural that
everyone – vampires included – feels a bit small in the CAPITAL.

the difference between this kanji and “貝” (Entry 21).
REMEMBERING THIS KANJI
“I’m tired of living a lie,” said the Cyclops, throwing down his club before
emerging in a tutu. “People need to SEE me for who I really am. They
need to SEE I’m not some slob who lounges around belching in a cave
littered with sailor bones. They need to SEE the truth: that I…am a
ballerina!”

“STOP! STOP!” the audience screamed.
It was horrible. The good figure skater’s posture was perfect, she was
skating as if on the bottom of a bun, yet was oblivious to the pole sticking
out of the ice in front of her. To be sure, no one could figure out what a
pole was doing there in the first place, but no matter; the story must STOP
here, as what happened next is too painful to relate.

COMPONENT 44
COMET
Much like a wandering comet, our friend can appear in a variety of
locations: as a slanted or curved line (as opposed to the horizontal “one”)
on top of a character, at the bottom, or right through the middle. One thing
worth keeping in mind is that you should always draw this component
from its head to its tail (i.e., in this case, from left to right).
KANJI 44

REMEMBERING THIS KANJI
“That’s not true,” said the comet. “I mean, let’s face it: I’m small, and
have only a FEW opportunities to meet others. Everyone knows a planet
because of its size and where it lives, but I move all over the place; that’s
why I have so FEW friends. It’s got nothing to do with my tail leaving a
mess on people’s carpets.”

COMPONENT 46
SNOWBOARD
KANJI 46
南 SOUTH
MEANING
South.
REMEMBERING THIS KANJI
Stepchildren can often be a problem. The gorilla knew this, of course,
when she married the scarecrow, for all the scarecrow’s son wanted to do
was snowboard. Because of this, there was a predictable response when
the gorilla suggested they travel SOUTH for their vacation.
“I don’t want to go SOUTH,” said Junior, pouting. “How can I
snowboard there?”
“Now don’t be like that, son,” said his father. “You know gorillas like
warm weather. We’re going SOUTH, and that’s all there is to it.”
Junior said nothing to this, but the gorilla knew very well what he was
thinking: “I wish Dad had married the polar bear.”

KANJI 47
工 CRAFT
MEANING
Have in mind the ideas of construction and manufacturing when you see this
kanji; it’s a versatile character that encompasses everything from handicrafts
to industrial products. When found at the end of a compound (as in the final
example below), this kanji can take on the meaning of “worker”, and usually
implies a person engaged in some type of manual labor.
REMEMBERING THIS KANJI
There’s no better symbol for CRAFT than an anvil.
COMMON PRONUNCIATIONS

KANJI 49
高 TALL
MEANING
Tall/High/Best. This kanji is also used to express the idea of “expensive”.
REMEMBERING THIS KANJI
The story of King Kong the gorilla is well known. What most people don’t
realize, however, is that it is based on an obscure Transylvanian legend. In
it, the angry gorilla kidnaps a baby vampire and climbs the TALLEST
hut in the land. Unfortunately for him, the baby’s father is none other than
Dracula; the famous vampire dons his police hat (he is, for reasons yet to
be understood, a part-time deputy in this legend) and flies to the rescue.
Even today there are inhabitants in the region who hold this story to be
true, although most people, to be sure, consider it a TALL tale.

COMMON PRONUNCIATIONS
Common ON reading: KŌ (コウ)

Buy.
REMEMBERING THIS KANJI
As an animal rights activist, I regularly BUY shellfish in order to set them
free. It’s heartbreaking for me to go into a store and find them suffering in
the tanks, their shells chipped and scarred. I BUY as many as possible,
naturally, and do my best to help heal them by placing bandages on their
wounds. But there are so many needing rescue… My only wish is for
others to join the cause; after all, I can’t BUY all the shellfish in the
world.

COMMON PRONUNCIATIONS
Common ON reading: none
Common kun reading: ka (か)
As nice as it is to have only one main reading to remember for this kanji,
mention must be made of a particular quirk in written Japanese that occurs
when certain verb stems are used to form nouns. The easiest way to
understand this is by comparing the second and third examples below. As you
can see, the noun in example 3 has “lost” the i (い) that would be present if
the kanji were in its -masu verb form, kaimasu. (買います). It is, in a
sense, implied, based on the hiragana ending after 上 . Unfortunately, there
are no hard and fast rules for this aspect of the language, and it can be
frustrating when such words are encountered. Our example, for instance, can
be seen variously as “買い上げ”, “買上げ”, or even “買上” in
different dictionaries!
It is worth keeping in mind, however, that not many kanji present such
difficulties, and that once a “primary” word (usually the -masu form of a
verb) has been learned, its related nouns will be easily recognized. Another
consolation should be the following: by having reached the stage where you
are dealing with such intricacies of the language, you are navigating among
the deepest levels of written Japanese.

KANJI 52
円 CIRCLE
MEANING
Circle/Round. This kanji is also used to denote the yen, Japan’s currency. The
connection originated from round oneyen coins.
REMEMBERING THIS KANJI
Every gorilla in the park hated the ranger, for his snide comments about
their grooming habits were known to animals far and wide. It was not
surprising, therefore, to hear that he had found himself surrounded by a
CIRCLE of angry silverbacks on emerging from his tent one day. No one
will know for certain what actually happened to the ranger, of course,
because the gorillas CIRCLED their wagons and refused to cooperate
with any investigation.

MEANING
This character expresses the idea of a basis or original state of something.
When used with its kun-yomi before words such as “president”, it can be
translated as “ex-”, or “former”.
REMEMBERING THIS KANJI
Two ballet legs are the BASIS of any good performance of Swan Lake. I

Neck in its physical sense, as well as the ideas of leader or chief.
REMEMBERING THIS KANJI
His sense of self became so wrapped up in his snowboard that things
started getting weird. After all, carrying a snow-board on your NECK at
the ski slope is one thing, but wearing it around your NECK at work is
another. When this started happening, even his colleagues in the office
were concerned enough to seek advice.

MEANING
Walking/Step/Pace. A secondary meaning of “rate” (as used in a financial
sense) is found only with BU (ブ), a less-common on-yomi.
REMEMBERING THIS KANJI
My WALKING style is a little unorthodox in that I’ll stop, take a few

JI and go) in the second position, as seen in the third examples of this entry

when naming their children (eg. Aki·ko); it is read “SHI” in the case of
males, and “ko” when applied to females.

KANJI 58
古 OLD
MEANING
Old/Ancient/Antique.
REMEMBERING THIS KANJI
Even though vampires never die, they do grow OLD and suffer the same
deterioration of mental faculties as the rest of us. The scarecrow can attest
to this; as he lives in a field next to an OLD folks home, he’ll often look
down to find a elderly vampire bravely fastening its gums onto his ankle.
It’s more of a nuisance for him than anything, of course, but he’s always
nice enough to show respect for those OLDER by acting scared.

WINTER is such a drab time of year. To add a bit of color to the season,
therefore, I enjoy strapping bags of jelly beans to chickens running in the
yard, as the beans spill out and make everything more cheerful. It’s a
mystery to me why more people don’t do this; even the grayest WINTER
would be tolerable if everyone followed my lead.

安 EASE
MEANING
The general sense is of “ease”, “peacefulness”, and “stability”. An important
secondary meaning is “inexpensive”. In this regard, the kanji’s opposite is
“高” (Entry 49).
REMEMBERING THIS KANJI
Pincers have always allowed the legendary women of history to lead lives
of EASE. Nefertiti and Cleopatra had pincers deposit them into cushiony
boats on the Nile; Catherine the Great had pincers EASE her onto a bed
strewn with sable… Even Joan of Arc, after a tiring day on the battlefield,
would always have pincers set her gently into a bubble bath.

MEANING
Summer.
REMEMBERING THIS KANJI
When SUMMER rolls around I enjoy throwing parties, but like most
farming folk, I don’t stand on ceremony. After all, what with it being so
darn hot in the SUMMER, the last thing I want to do is cook! So you’d
better be prepared if you drop by. I’ll give you the top of a bun, of course,
but you’ll be heading straight to the coop after that. “Go catch yourself a
running chicken,” I’ll say. “This here’s a self-serve party.”

千 THOUSAND
MEANING
Thousand. Like the character for “hundred” (Entry 51), this kanji sometimes
conveys a general idea of “many”.
REMEMBERING THIS KANJI
My favorite story in the “THOUSAND and One Nights” is the tale in
which a comet on a THOUSAND-year journey has a chat with a
scarecrow.
“What’s up?” he asks.
“Nothing much besides my getting sick of this view,” answers the
scarecrow. “I must say, I’d sure love to take a trip like yours.”
“Well, why don’t you go, then?” says the comet, smiling.
“Remember: a journey of a THOUSAND miles starts with a single
step.”
“Gee, thanks for that pearl of wisdom,” says the scarecrow
sarcastically. “In case you haven’t noticed, I’m tied to a couple of boards
here.”

COMPONENT 66
GIRAFFE
You will notice this component used extensively in written Japanese, as it
appears in almost one hundred kanji.
KANJI 66
休 REST
MEANING
Rest.
REMEMBERING THIS KANJI
One of the surprises of my trip to Africa was learning that giraffes
RESTED in trees. The safari leader mentioned that this was natural
behavior. “They prefer baobabs,” he said. “The branches are lower, so
when the giraffes make a running leap at them they can jump higher into
the tree. But this is not done simply for REST,” he then added. “It also
serves as an effective way for any giraffe to avoid its natural creditors.”

KANJI 68
本 MAIN
MEANING
This intriguing character encompasses a range of meanings from “main” to
“origin”, and is also used to emphasize the idea of “this”. When encountered
alone, however, it often indicates a book. It is also one of the more common
of an infamous group of kanji that Japanese uses for counting, being
employed for long, cylindrical objects such as pencils and bottles. The sense
of “origin”, incidentally, is evident in the compound for Japan itself, the
“Land of the Rising Sun”.
REMEMBERING THIS KANJI
Despite cultural differences, there is a surprising amount of commonality
in the world’s MAIN myths. The people of Ur, for example, clearly tell
Enkidu in the “Epic of Gilgamesh” that the MAIN race of people was
conceived from a “union between hamburger patty and tree”. Beowulf,
too, quotes Norse mythology to explain the MAIN purpose of mankind:
“Go forth, so that from patties will sprout mighty trees…” Coincidence?
In the MAIN, it’s unlikely.

MEANING
Change/Transform. When used as a suffix (as in several of the compounds
below), this character expresses a variety of English words ending in “-
ification” or “-ization”.
REMEMBERING THIS KANJI
Grandpa liked nothing more than to help those down on their luck. But he
never gave money. I learned this when I saw him carrying a stuffed giraffe
down to skid row one day.
“This is for you,” he said to a beggar, passing him the toy. “A
companion to share your woe.”
The beggar nodded, and after taking his gift started immediately
across the street.
“Where are you going?” Grandpa asked.
“This giraffe is so wonderful,” said the beggar, “that I want to show it

to all my friends in the pawn shop.”
Grandpa smiled. “Now do you understand?” he said to me. “Giving
money CHANGES nothing. It is only through stuffed giraffes that a
beggar’s life can truly be CHANGED.”

The physical body (of a person or object), as well as secondary ideas of

mind from “休” (Entry 66).
REMEMBERING THIS KANJI
As the main part of a giraffe’s identity is tied to its statuesque BODY, all
giraffes have a tendency to be vain. This naturally breeds conflict on the
savanna. It is a rare wildebeest, for example, who hasn’t been left with
crippling BODY issues after watching a giraffe stride nobly along in the
distance. As cats, however, it is the lions who are especially BODY
conscious and apt to take a slight personally. Though the main part of their
diet lies elsewhere, they will attack any giraffe who looks down on them.

Man/Male.
REMEMBERING THIS KANJI
There is a story from feudal Japan in which a lord asks a group of MEN to
demonstrate their strength. The task he sets them is simple: to lift up as
much of a rice field as possible. Each MAN in the competition does his
best, of course, but none save the last can pull up more than an armful of
muck. What is this final MAN’S secret, you ask? It should be obvious: he
was the only one with enough sense to use a bulldozer.

家 HOUSE
MEANING
This character generally imparts some sense of relation to a house or family.
When used as a suffix, however, it denotes a person having some degree of
skill or interest with respect to the kanji preceding it. The final compound
below illustrates this aspect of its meaning.
REMEMBERING THIS KANJI
People told me I was crazy when they learned I was moving from my farm
to the metropolis. ‘The people are cold there, and you won’t make any
friends’, they all said. Well, I went anyway, and to prove them I wrong got
out my pincers and hung an enormous pig outside my HOUSE in order to
welcome people as they walked by. And yet this is the strange thing:
despite all the squealing for days on end, nobody visited, and when I told
people my HOUSE was the one with the pincers and pig, they quit

talking to me altogether! I guess everyone was right to say folks wouldn’t
be very friendly, ’cause they sure weren’t when it came to my HOUSE.

Think.
REMEMBERING THIS KANJI
And so I took the heart and buried it in a rice field. But soon I began to

for food? Horrors! All I could do was THINK…THINK of what I had
done, until there was nothing in my head but the beating of that hideous
heart in the rice field. But I know what you THINK: you either THINK
I’m mad, or that this story sounds awfully familiar.

some connection to metal in general.

Following a quick break with his buddies, the snowboarder had another
vision. This time, however, the genie was very specific: “Dude, unless this
GOLDEN snowboard is kept dry at all times, it will immediately turn
back into fiber-glass. You must, therefore, always use an umbrella, even
on the gnarliest runs. Should you not keep it dry…well, it would still be a
decent enough board, it just wouldn’t be GOLD anymore. And GOLD is
like, really valuable.”

“For godsakes,” said the scarecrow. “When are you going to get tired
of that joke?”

COMPONENT 86
CANDLESTICK HOLDER
KANJI 86
青 BLUE
MEANING
Blue. Interestingly, this character is also applied to a few objects that
Westerners invariably consider green, so prepare yourself to be confronted
with blue traffic lights and blue vegetables, amongst other things. As in
English, the sense of youth and immaturity is tied up with this idea of
“green”; the third compound below provides an example.
REMEMBERING THIS KANJI
Even the moon can get depressed, and on those occasions when he’s
feeling BLUE he doesn’t give off his normal amount of light. To cover up
for this he’ll take out a candlestick holder, but as there’s nothing in it, his
ploy doesn’t fool anyone. Luckily for us, he only feels this way once in a
BLUE moon.

KANJI 87
土 EARTH
MEANING
Think of earth here as in “dirt”, not the planet on which we live. Take a
moment to note the subtle difference between this kanji and “士” (Entry 84);
you’ve developed a practiced eye if you’re now able to take such variations
into account! No story required.

COMPONENT 88
FINGER
A ring and a string for a finger. There will be little chance of forgetting this
component, incidentally, as it is present in nearly a hundred kanji - most
relating in some way to hands and arms.
KANJI 88
掛 HANG
MEANING
Hang. Note how the last stroke of the bottom “earth” component leads into
the next line by being drawn on an upward angle.
REMEMBERING THIS KANJI
Fingers can indicate harsh criticism, especially when it comes to bad
figure skating. “HANG up your skates!” people will scream while
pointing, making the bad figure skater want to hide behind a couple piles
of earth. Some skaters, apparently, can do nothing but HANG their heads
in shame.

COMPONENT 89
CHAIR
KANJI 89
万 TEN THOUSAND
MEANING
Ten thousand. More so than “百” and “千” (Entries 51 and
65), this character can express the general idea of a “countless amount” of
something.
REMEMBERING THIS KANJI
The ancient writer Xenophon tells the story of TEN THOUSAND Greek
mercenaries marching against Persia in 401 B.C. What is interesting is that
each of the TEN THOUSAND carries a lawn chair, together with a shield
shaped like the top of a bun.

being broken into components. Because of this, no story is required.

KANJI 91
電 ELECTRIC
MEANING
Electric/Electricity.
REMEMBERING THIS KANJI
The atmosphere was ELECTRIC: rain and sun were on a collision
course! At the last moment, however, a hook was used to hold the sun
back, saving either it from being extinguished or the rain from being
evaporated. As the kanji shows, the elements remain in this state even
now, so close than an ELECTRIC current would have difficulty passing
between them.

COMPONENT 92

Make sure you clearly see the difference between this component and the
“pincers” .
KANJI 92
売 SELL
MEANING
Sell.
REMEMBERING THIS KANJI
It is common knowledge that the statues of Easter Island relate to the visit
of a UFO. What is less well known is that the gentleman piloting this
UFO chose to SELL ballet gear to the locals. What was the purpose of
this? Were the natives to put tutus on the monoliths? Wear the slippers
themselves? Given the lack of ballet dancers or practice facilities on
Easter Island at the time, anthropologists wonder why this gentleman
didn’t SELL the locals something more useful.

KANJI 93
者 INDIVIDUAL
MEANING
Think of individual in the sense of a human being. The characters in a
compound that precede this kanji (it never comes first) define the person.
REMEMBERING THIS KANJI
It’s never a good idea to generalize, but let’s face it: you can tell a lot
about an INDIVIDUAL by the way they look. A heap of earth, for
example, tends to be dirty; it clearly doesn’t care about appearances and is
thus down to earth. Suns, on the other hand, are obviously outgoing
INDIVIDUALS with blazing style. Comets, however, have personalities
that lie between these extremes (as the kanji shows); with qualities of
earth and sun, each must be considered a separate INDIVIDUAL.

入 ENTER
MEANING
Entering/Putting in. Make sure that you clearly see the difference between
this kanji and those for “人” (Entry 2), and “八” (Entry 19). No story
required.
COMMON PRONUNCIATIONS
Common ON reading: NYŪ (ニュウ)
Common kun readings: hai (はい); i (い)
It is worth looking carefully at the first three entries below. The word
“hai·ru” expresses the intransitive meaning of the verb “enter” (that is, to
enter some type of place); it is rarely used in compounds. “i·ru”, on the other
hand, is most commonly found in compounds, primarily when the other kanji
is read with kun-yomi (NYŪ performs this function when the other kanji is
read with on-yomi). The word i·reru is simply the transitive companion of
hai·ru.
One last twist is that the kanji can behave on rare occasions like 買; this

can be seen in the fourth example.

REMEMBERING THIS KANJI
I’ve come in from the rain and need to straighten my hair for a date. I do

the rain had at some point become SNOW.

KANJI 97
間 INTERVAL
MEANING
This character indicates an interval in time or space, and thus incorporates the
ideas of “during”, “between” and “among”. When used with the kun-yomi
“ma”, it can also mean a room.
REMEMBERING THIS KANJI
If the sun in this kanji is rising (as every fiber in my being leads me to
believe), it will pass, after a short INTERVAL, through that INTERVAL
between the gates.

KANJI 98

MEANING
Leave/Let out. Take care with the stroke order of this character.
REMEMBERING THIS KANJI
All right, so maybe I misunderstood my boss: putting a couple of garbage
cans on a pole and standing at the EXIT of the voting station wasn’t the
right thing to do. But asking people to put “yes” votes in one can and “no”
votes in the other…wouldn’t anyone have thought that’s what she meant
by an EXIT poll?

COMMON PRONUNCIATIONS

the last example below.

KANJI 99
生 LIFE
MEANING
One of the most fascinating characters in the language, this kanji deals with
life in all its guises. Along with the ideas of “birth”, “production”, and
“growing”, it also incorporates the notions of “pure”, “raw”, and “fresh”, in
everything from beer to silk. When used as a suffix, it will often indicate
“student”.
REMEMBERING THIS KANJI
“Is there a better symbol of LIFE,” asked Sartre, “than a jelly bean stuck
to the side of a candlestick holder, one that sits there alone and grows
brittle with each passing year?”
It’s an interesting question. From what I’ve heard, though, jelly beans
hold their flavor quite well, even when stuck to candlestick holders. So
who knows, maybe LIFE isn’t so bad after all.

COMMON PRONUNCIATIONS
Common ON reading: SEI (セイ)
Common kun readings: i (い); u (う); nama (なま)
In terms of its variety of pronunciations, kanji do not come any more
complicated than this. Perhaps it’s appropriate, though: life itself can be
complicated, so shouldn’t the character representing it be as well?
Fortunately, the two initial kun-yomi are verb stems (as are “o” and “ha” of
the less common kun-yomi below), and nama appears only in the first
position. This will always belong to the ranks of the toughest kanji, however,
so allow yourself time to learn it, while not forgetting to enjoy a few of the
fifth example below along the way.
kun-yomi suggestions: “eagle”; “oodles”; “Vietnam apple”

CHAPTER 6 (KANJI 101-120)
KANJI 101
美 BEAUTIFUL
MEANING
Used for all things beautiful, this character lives up to its name in a visual
sense as well. Take care with the stroke order by writing the components as
listed.
REMEMBERING THIS KANJI
The Zulu, along with several other tribes in southern Africa, equate large
size with being BEAUTIFUL. A king, therefore, will make good use of
the region’s rabbit population to grow as large as possible, through eating
incredible amounts of a filling rabbit stew. Read from the top down, the
kanji shows this process clearly: rabbit goes into king…king becomes as
large a sumo wrestler… large is BEAUTIFUL.

COMPONENT 102
DINOSAUR
KANJI 102
島 ISLAND
MEANING
Island.
REMEMBERING THIS KANJI
OK, so I have this great idea for a movie. It’s set on an ISLAND, but what
makes this ISLAND interesting is that some dinosaurs are still living on
one of its mountains! It’s a blockbuster concept, and though I’m still
working out the details, I’ve already decided on a title: “Jurassic
ISLAND”.

COMMON PRONUNCIATIONS
Common ON reading: TŌ (トウ)
Common kun reading: shima (しま)

KANJI 103
寸 TINY
MEANING
Tiny.
REMEMBERING THIS KANJI
How TINY, you ask? Well, given that the soccer player in this illustration
is life-size…pretty TINY. This kanji, as the lack of compounds below
makes clear, will be much more important for us as a component than a
character on its own; the tiny soccer player will be used to suggest it in all
future stories.

KANJI 104
寺 TEMPLE
MEANING
(Buddhist) temple.
REMEMBERING THIS KANJI
Tiny soccer players are always in danger of being pushed around by their
opponents. As a result of this, they usually become known as fearless
defenders who protect their positions at all costs — treating even the
tiniest piece of earth they occupy like a TEMPLE that must not be
defiled. A TEMPLE in which it is permitted to wear cleats, of course.
COMMON PRONUNCIATIONS
Common ON reading: JI (ジ)
Common kun reading: tera (てら)
The kun-yomi becomes voiced when not in the first position, as it does

below in the third example. The final compound can also be read by the
respective kun-yomi: furu·dera (ふ る·でら).

KANJI 105
先 PRECEDE
MEANING
This character has a multitude of meanings, all of them derived from the
general sense of “preceding”, or the idea of an object “ahead” in a literal or
figurative way. Depending on the context in which it appears, this kanji can
signify the “tip” or “point” of something, the general future (or the specific
past, when used as in the third compound), or a destination. It can also refer
to people in the sense of “the other party”.
REMEMBERING THIS KANJI
Most people are unaware that Tchaikovsky deleted a jelly bean character
from his ballet “The Nutcracker”. This jelly bean was to always
PRECEDE the Sugar Plum Fairy onstage, then be pinned to the earth and
devoured by her at the end of the work (she by this time having been
driven wild with sugar cravings). It was an edgy scene, but fortunately for
ballet lovers everywhere, Tchaikovsky concluded it was incompatible
with what PRECEDED, and decided to remove the jelly bean character
altogether.

COMMON PRONUNCIATIONS
Common ON reading: SEN (セン)
Common kun reading: saki (さき)
kun-yomi suggestion: “sack eels”. If using your own idea for this kun-yomi,
keep in mind that Japan’s famous rice wine is pronounced sake (さけ), and
should not be confused with the reading of this character.
Create your on-yomi keyword and enter it in the table at the back of the
book. After that, write your sentence to remember the on-yomi and kun-
yomi readings in the box below.

= (Our) teacher went to the Japanese Alps for winter vacation.

COMPONENT 106
PICNIC TABLE
Admittedly, this is not the most comfortable-looking picnic table.
KANJI 106
開 OPEN
MEANING
Open. Secondary meanings include “starting”, and the idea of “developing”
things (in the sense of opening or reclaiming land, for example).
REMEMBERING THIS KANJI
Their picnic thrown into chaos by the sight of Visigoths on the horizon, the
partiers ran desperately back to the castle. “OPEN the gates!”, “OPEN
the gates!” they yelled to no avail, for nobody on the other side could hear
them. It was only when the picnic table was used as a battering ram (thus
breaking it) that the gates finally flew OPEN to let them in.

COMMON PRONUNCIATIONS
Common ON reading: KAI (カイ)
Common kun readings: a (あ); hira (ひら)
As a glance at the first three examples below suggests, this character can be a
little tricky. In the general physical sense of “to open”, however, a·ku (あ·
く) and a·keru (あ·ける) function as a normal intransitive/transitive verb
pair. The word hira·ku, on the other hand, is more concerned with a
metaphorical or non-physical sense of “opening”, and appears primarily in
certain expressions (in the “opening”, for example, of a conference, of new
lands, or of cherry blossoms). Expressing the sense of a shop’s front door
being open would thus call for the verb a·ku, while conveying the idea of
opening a business would require hira·ku.
In the first position, this kanji invariably takes the on-yomi.
kun-yomi suggestions: “appetite”; “he rapidly”
Create your on-yomi keyword and enter it in the table at the back of the
book. After that, write your sentence to remember the on-yomi and kun-

COMPONENT 107
GAS STOVE
KANJI 107
鳥 BIRD
MEANING
Bird.
REMEMBERING THIS KANJI
As recent archaeological evidence has shown, BIRDS were an important
part of a dinosaur’s diet. Numerous cave drawings, in fact, show
dinosaurs cooking BIRDS over gas stoves. This is interesting, for it has
led some scholars to theorize that it was the dinosaurs’ clumsy use of gas
stoves that led to their extinction. If this is true, it explains nicely how
BIRDS have managed to survive to the present day.

KANJI 109
外 OUTSIDE
MEANING
Outside. The idea of “foreign” or “other” is also present, as the third example
below makes clear. The less common readings convey some secondary
meanings of removal and disconnection.
REMEMBERING THIS KANJI
There is a very rigid hierarchy in the world of figure skating. When
evening arrives, for instance, the arenas are often so full that the poor
figure skaters are forced OUTSIDE. Unfortunately, the frozen puddles on
the OUTSIDE parking lot do not provide nearly enough room for jumps.

KANJI 110

MEANING
Tongue.
REMEMBERING THIS KANJI
Interesting fact: a survey showed that Thousand Island dressing was a
favorite amongst vampires. “It’s very pleasing to the TONGUE,” said
one, “and it doesn’t have any…unfortunate ingredients.” Manufacturers of
garlic-based dressings, it seems, need to take the TONGUES of vampires
more into account if they want access to this market segment.

“You have to be sly if you’re going to break out of this prison,” my
cellmate told me as I settled in. “The guards won’t allow us any pens so
there’s no way to draw up an escape DIAGRAM. That’s why I have
these.” He placed a couple of moldy jelly beans and some rotting banana
peels on my bunk. “These jelly beans will be us,” he whispered, “and the
banana peels will represent the guards. It’s not much, but we can plan our
break using these as a DIAGRAM.”
I nodded. My time in prison, it seemed, was not only going to be long,
but more boring than I could have possibly imagined.

親 PARENT

“Parent”, together with the senses of intimacy and closeness.
REMEMBERING THIS KANJI
When she was young, her PARENTS would often sing the following
ditty:
“Stand on a tree,
And what do you see?
Your PARENTS! Your PARENTS!”
It was cute, of course, but they really should have stopped at some
point. After all, it wasn’t easy for her as a university student having to
answer the question “What’s up with your PARENTS and that dumb
song?”

KANJI 118
切 CUT
MEANING
Cut. When the kun-yomi is used as a suffix it can impart a sense of
completely finishing something, or acting in a decisive manner. The final
compound provides an example.

Day of the week.
REMEMBERING THIS KANJI
Every DAY OF THE WEEK the squirrels sit on their brick wall and wait
for the sun to come up. Once it does, it becomes light enough for each to
grab a comb and start slicking back his fur in order to look tough. This is
always necessary. After all, every DAY OF THE WEEK is a struggle if
you’re a squirrel.

KANJI 122
道 ROAD
MEANING
Road/Way. This interesting kanji can signify both a physical road and a
spiritual “path”. In this latter sense it is often translated as “the way”.
REMEMBERING THIS KANJI
Being so poor growing up, we had to use our imaginations when it came
time for fun. That’s why it was so lucky for us when the seal washed up on
the beach that day; once some yellow lines were painted down the back of
its neck, we had ourselves a nice ROAD on which to race our toys. And
did we ever get good mileage out of that ROAD! We played on it for ages,
and only quit using it when our wheels started getting stuck.

KANJI 123
天 HEAVEN
MEANING
Heaven/The heavens. This character can indicate both the spiritual sense of
heaven as well as the more down to earth notions of sky and air.
REMEMBERING THIS KANJI
The Japanese believe that sumo wrestlers in HEAVEN live in mansions
built of food. The ceilings of these are made from the tops of buns that
exude various types of mustards and sauces when they leak. Such living
conditions must truly be HEAVEN for a sumo wrestler.
COMMON PRONUNCIATIONS
Common ON reading: TEN (テン)
Common kun reading: none

Note how the on-yomi for “country” (国) is voiced in the first example
below. One more curiosity occurs in the fourth compound; in this word, note
how 天 changes the on-yomi of “king” from Ō (オウ) to NŌ (ノウ) in
order to make the pronunciation smoother. This type of phonetic change is
extremely rare. Note that the sample sentence contains an irregular reading
(明日).

KANJI 124
分 PART
MEANING
This important character suggests the ideas of “dividing” and “portion”. It
appears in a wide range of words, but the sense of division is always present
in some way; the first example below, for instance, can be thought of as
“parting” the unknown to arrive at understanding.
REMEMBERING THIS KANJI
Modern scientists may scoff at the notion, but a lot of people still believe
that volcanoes show how the underground dwellers made their way to the
surface. By PARTING the rock and magma with swords on the way up, it
is thought, they created the volcanoes we have today. Though the kanji
clearly shows a sword beneath the missing PART of a volcano, it is
impossible to verify this theory until the underground dwellers themselves
shed more light on their past.

COMMON PRONUNCIATIONS

Common kun reading: wa (わ)
kun-yomi suggestion: “wacky”
Create your on-yomi keyword and enter it in the table at the back of the
book. After that, write your sentence to remember the on-yomi and kun-
yomi readings in the box below.
LESS COMMON PRONUNCIATIONS
Less common ON readings: FUN (フン); BU (ブ)
Less common kun reading: none
As these readings are both used following numbers, is important to know the
context in which each is employed. FUN relates to minutes (of time or arc),
as in the example 五分 GO·FUN (ゴ·フン): five minutes. BU deals with
percentages and rates; 五分 in this sense would be pronounced GO·BU (ゴ
·ブ), and mean either five (or fifty) percent. It merits learning the words for
minutes as irregular readings, as they will be needed for telling time.
Note also that 大分 DAI·BUN (ダイ·ブン), one of many Japanese
words expressing the idea of “much” or “very”, is often pronounced DAI·BU
(ダイ·ブ).

Labor Code regulations require the following disclaimer be inserted: “This
is not an appropriate method of lifting heavy objects.”
KANJI 125
物 THING
MEANING
Thing/Object. Note that the writing order for “cow” differs when it is used as
a component; slanting the final stroke upward makes for a smoother
transition to the next part of the character.
REMEMBERING THIS KANJI
“What’s that THING?” asked a guy stooping next to a cow.
“That’s my tail,” said the cow, irritated.
“And what’s that THING?”
“It’s a hoof, OK?” Everyone knows it’s a hoof.”
“And what about those THINGS?”
“What?! How dare you stoop so low as to question me about my
udder!”

Though THINGS had started out well, relations between cows and
tourists had slowly become strained.
COMMON PRONUNCIATIONS
Common ON reading: BUTSU (ブツ)

used in compounds. This is a character that has to be taken on a word-for-
word basis.

“Brand NEW,” he said. “I just got it.”
“What’s that stuff on the blade, then?”
“Oh, that? That’s from the wrapper. Trust me, it’s totally NEW.”

REMEMBERING THIS KANJI
Nobody could figure out what was going on with the crops. The oats were
acting wilder than ever, and rumor had it that gangs of wheat were causing
trouble amongst the barley. PRIVATELY we began to worry about the
harvest, especially when stalks of rye began showing up with bruises and
broken crutches. Several of us tried to ask the crops what was going on,
but nobody got very far. “What happens between us crops is none of your
business,” they always replied. “It’s PRIVATE, you got that?

REMEMBERING THIS KANJI
After a long day policing the savanna, the ranger went to her local
watering hole for a drink. Surprisingly, the giraffes were already there,
and seemed well on the way to making a NIGHT of it.
“It’s safe to come here the moment a comet is visible in the evening,”
said one, slurring over a gin and tonic. “That means it’s NIGHT, and dark
enough so that nothing can hunt.”
“I wouldn’t be so sure about that,” said the ranger. “The leopards I
just passed on the way over didn’t look like they were coming here for a
NIGHTCAP.”

(Entry 105) to get a sense of the subtle differences between these two
characters.
REMEMBERING THIS KANJI
We all know that a waxing moon comes BEFORE a full moon, but how
many know where the expression “waxing moon” originated? It’s an
interesting story, in that the moon used to work at a snowboard shop long
BEFORE he took his place in the sky. Using a chisel, he would wax the
snowboards as carefully as possible, trying not to let the chisel slip and
add yet another crater to his face. He was, by all accounts, a conscientious
worker, one who always reminded customers to prep their boards
BEFORE they hit the slopes.

least one other line in the kanji. The next entry provides an example.
KANJI 136
書 WRITE
MEANING
Write. This character has to do with all things related to writing, and can
suggest such things as books, notes, documents, and calligraphy, amongst
others.
REMEMBERING THIS KANJI
Even if you dip them in ink, it is simply not possible to WRITE the
Japanese kanji for “two” using a pitchfork (it makes a triple line) or a
pole (a single line). Using the sun is even worse; it burns the paper and is
thus unsuitable for any kind of WRITING.

COMMON PRONUNCIATIONS
Common ON reading: SHO (ショ)

Meet/Meeting. When found at the end of compounds, this kanji often
expresses English words such as “society”, “association” and “party”.
REMEMBERING THIS KANJI
“What’s with the umbrella?” she asked on MEETING the spy, looking
around nervously.
“What do you mean?”
“What do I mean!? The weather’s perfect, so why in the world are you
under an umbrella? Everyone’s staring at us!”
“That’s enough!” interrupted the spy. “You obviously don’t know the

farmed salmon didn’t taste NEARLY as good as wild.

KANJI 146
引 PULL

Pull. This character also conveys the idea of “attraction” (best seen in the
fourth example) and the senses of receding and withdrawing. You will notice
it frequently on signs; it indicates “pull” on doors, and “discount” when used
with numbers.
REMEMBERING THIS KANJI
A bow obviously needs to be PULLED in order to work effectively as a
weapon, and the same is true for a pole. How so? Well, a catapult is
basically a pole, and if you think about it, the word “PULL” is actually
found in “catapult”.

Shell. This is another character that rarely appears on its own. Like similar
kanji we have encountered, however, it proves valuable as a component.
REMEMBERING THIS KANJI
This is another kanji to which we will give an external meaning – in this
case, a fly swatter. Why a fly swatter? Well, you’ll need one if you ever go

KANJI 149
気 SPIRIT
MEANING
This fascinating character encompasses a range of meanings, including the
ideas of “spirit”, “air”, “feeling”, and “mood”. It is worth spending some time
getting to know this kanji; it is found in many common words and
expressions.
REMEMBERING THIS KANJI
I wanted to be a ski-jumper, but the national team crushed my SPIRIT
when they left me off the squad. Oddly, it wasn’t long after this that I grew
to dislike everything about the sport, and began sabotaging all the facilities
I could find. My method was simple: use a hammer to drive hamburger
patties into the ski jump so that the athletes would be thrown off course,
and leave banana peels on the side so that the spectators would slip. Isn’t
it strange what happens when the SPIRIT moves you?

MEANING
Speak, along with the ideas of conversations and stories.
REMEMBERING THIS KANJI
“SPEAK freely.”
“Though it is on the tip of my tongue, pharaoh, I dare not say it.”
“Then I order you: SPEAK!”
I shriveled inwardly, knowing I would have to say it to avoid a
tongue-lashing, or worse. “All right,” I answered, shaking, “if you must
know then, yes, it’s true: those pants do tend to make you look big in the
hips.”
Pharaoh approached me with his headgear swaying menacingly. “I say
to you this,” he warned. “You will lose that tongue should you SPEAK of
this further.”

downhill. Also, keep up a good pace or you’ll either turn into a swamp or
one of those rivers without a current that everyone laughs at. Oh, and
don’t be afraid to overflow your banks now and then; if anyone asks

I didn’t want to be rude, but a hamburger patty on a pile of uncooked
rice? COME on! Not to mention the noise we all made as we crunched
our way through the grains… Really, it was enough to make me wish I
hadn’t COME to the patty and rice festival at all.
COMMON PRONUNCIATIONS
Common ON reading: RAI (ライ)

Common kun reading: ku (く)
This character is infamous for being one of only two irregular verbs in
Japanese, but whereas “to do” (為る) is rarely presented with its kanji (it is
now universally written in hiragana), “to come” still is. What this means for
us is that the character can be read variously as “ku” (く), “ki” (き) or “ko”
(こ), depending on which tense of the verb is being used. The sample
sentence offers an example of the polite past tense. Note, however, an
important exception in the second compound below (an extremely common
word); when following the kanji “出”, 来 is always read “ki”. Lucky for us
there are only two odd verbs in Japanese!

KANJI 157
学 STUDY
MEANING
This character appears in words related to study and learning. When used as a
suffix, it is often equivalent to the English “-ology”. The final compound
offers such an example.
REMEMBERING THIS KANJI
“I don’t want to STUDY,” the child said. “You can’t make me.”
“Oh, really?” the teacher replied. “Don’t you know what happens to a
child who doesn’t STUDY? A UFO flies down to get them.”
“Is that so?” said the child, now sauntering to the blackboard. “And
when the UFO arrives, will my screams be like this? Like claws scraping
down a blackboard?”
“No! Don’t do that!”
“Then what happens if I refuse to STUDY?”
“Nothing! You become very successful!”
So it was true, then, thought the other students: there really was no

need to STUDY.

: My MIND, it’s filled with the sound of your
heart.
Romeo :Oh…um…that’s great.

:What do you mean “that’s great”? Is that the best
you can do? Doesn’t this moment inspire anything
more eloquent than that?
Romeo :Hey look, I’ve got a lot on my MIND, OK?
Finals are coming up, I’ve got an important stag
hunt this weekend, my cousin’s wedding is just
around the corner…oh, never MIND.

KANJI 159
又 AGAIN
MEANING
Again/Also. Though this character will rarely be encountered on its own
(indeed, it is often written in hiragana), it does serve as a component in
several important kanji. Like other characters we have encountered of this
type, we will assign a meaning with a more immediate visual connection: an
ironing board.
REMEMBERING THIS KANJI
“Do it AGAIN,” ordered the headmistress.
AGAIN and AGAIN I brought out the ironing board; AGAIN and
AGAIN I failed to get rid of the wrinkles.

CHAPTER 9 (KANJI 161-180)
KANJI 161
公 PUBLIC
MEANING
Public. In many instances, this character serves as the opposite to “私”
(Entry 131).
REMEMBERING THIS KANJI
The eruption of a volcano is a very PUBLIC event, but nobody suffers
more than those on crutches who are blown off their feet. After all, if
you’re hobbling along with broken crutches as a result of this, you might
as well carry a sign that announces “Stay Away: I’m Really Unlucky”. It’s
a very PUBLIC humiliation.

KANJI 162
品 GOODS
MEANING
This character expresses the idea of “goods” or “articles” in the majority of
compounds in which it appears. It can occasionally have the more abstract
notion of “refinement”; the fourth and fifth examples below illustrate this
aspect of its meaning.
REMEMBERING THIS KANJI
You can imagine the GOODS a trio of vampires might have: capes,
coffins, hair gel, teeth whiteners, blood pudding…all manner of GOODS,

COMPONENT 163
MUGGER
KANJI 163
市 CITY
MEANING
City. A secondary meaning relates to “market”; in this sense the character can
refer to anything from a simple fair to the idea of a general “business”
market. This will be the first of four kanji in Chapter 9 connected with groups
of people living in a defined area; moving from larger to smaller units will
provide a sense of their relative sizes.

KANJI 164
主 PRIMARY
MEANING
This character conveys a sense of importance and authority; it is used in this
vein with both concrete objects and abstract ideas. Note the difference
between this kanji and that for “Jewel” in Entry 24 (玉).
REMEMBERING THIS KANJI
The PRIMARY reason a king puts a jelly bean on his head is to learn
from the reaction it generates amongst his subjects. If no one dares tell him
it’s there, the king knows he is ruling PRIMARILY by fear. If it is
pointed out to him with a smile, however, he knows he is viewed
PRIMARILY with kindness.

KANJI 165
丁 BLOCK
MEANING
The main sense is of a city “block”, although more obscure meanings can
range from “pages” to “polite”. This is a quirky character that shows up often
as a component in other kanji.
REMEMBERING THIS KANJI
Let’s face it: this looks like a capital “T”, so best think of it as an overhead
view of a “T” junction marking the intersection of BLOCKS.

COMPONENT 169
WEIGHTLIFTER
KANJI 169
空 EMPTY
MEANING
Empty/Sky. As in English, “empty” can incorporate suggestions of
uselessness and futility.
REMEMBERING THIS KANJI
Like a lot of students, I became a weightlifter at college and practiced my
craft well. First up were EMPTY cans – I could curl a lot of those. Next
came EMPTY bottles, followed by EMPTY kegs. It was only later that I
realized how EMPTY the craft of weightlifting beer really was.

COMMON PRONUNCIATIONS
Common ON reading: KŪ (クウ)
Common kun readings: sora (そら); kara (から)
This kanji takes a bit of work, although KŪ is by far the most common
reading in compounds. sora, as shown in the first example, means “sky”; it
becomes voiced in the second position (as in the compound following). kara
occasionally appears in first position with a meaning of “empty”, and is a
reading you will no doubt be familiar with from the third example.
kun-yomi suggestions: “soar albatross”; “caramba”

Less common kun reading: a (あ)
This reading is used to make the verbs 空く and 空ける (a·ku and
a·keru). Meaning “to open”, these can be thought of as interchangeable with

the more common 開く and 開 ける (also a·ku and a·keru) from Entry
106. A few nouns, however, make use of this kanji exclusively: 空き缶*
(a·ki KAN) “an empty can”, and 空き瓶* (a·ki BIN) “an empty bottle”,
are two examples.

KANJI 170
町 TOWN
MEANING
Town. One size smaller than a city is the town, making this the second of our
four kanji related to people living in defined locations. This character can
also refer on occasion to a “street” or an “alley”.
REMEMBERING THIS KANJI
“TOWN! TOWN!”

死 DEATH
MEANING
Death.
REMEMBERING THIS KANJI
“So how did DEATH arrive for you?” she asked the beggar.
“It was weird,” he said. “I was begging on my usual corner when I
noticed it starting to get dark. “Is it evening already?” I wondered. I
looked up to check, but realized I was mistaken, that what I had thought
was evening was actually the top of a bun settling over me. Now, you
would have thought I’d be scared by this, but I wasn’t; the bun was really
warm and smelled great, and for the first time in ages I didn’t feel hungry.
I wasn’t afraid of DEATH at all.”

COMPONENT 173
RAZOR
KANJI 173
行 GO
MEANING
“Go” is the primary meaning of this character, along with related ideas of
“carrying out” or “doing”. Far less common is the secondary sense of a
“stroke” or “line” of text.
REMEMBERING THIS KANJI
When the razor moved into our neighborhood, no one in the block knew
quite what to do. “How can it fit in with us?” I asked my wife. “GO and
invite it to our block party,” she said. I didn’t want to do this, of course,
but this turned out to be a great idea, for the razor was a big hit when it
came time to prepare the hamburger patties that day. Shaving each one
perfectly, it soon had everyone cheering “GO! GO! GO!” as it worked
faster and faster. “You know something, honey?” I said to my wife.
“Looks like the razor’s going to fit in well with our block after all. You
were right telling me to GO and invite it here.”

COMMON PRONUNCIATIONS
Common ON reading: KŌ (コウ)
Common kun readings: i (い); yu (ゆ)
This is another character for our rogues’ gallery of troublesome kanji, and
one that merits added attention from the outset. For the general sense of the
verb “to go”, i·ku (い·く) is the choice; yu·ku (ゆ·く) is employed far less
often and is of most use in a few specific compounds (such as in the second
example), or as a suffix meaning “bound for” (as in the third). It can also act
like 買, albeit strangely in that on rare occasions it will incorporate yuku as
opposed to yuki. This is seen in the well-known compound yuku·e·FU·MEI
(ゆく·え· フ·メイ) 行方不明: “Missing”, built from the two words
“whereabouts” (Go/Direction*) and “unclear” (Not/Bright).
kun-yomi suggestions: “Egypt”; “Unicorn”
Create your on-yomi keyword and enter it in the table at the back of the

yomi readings in the box below.
LESS COMMON PRONUNCIATIONS

Less common ON readings: GYŌ (ギョウ); AN (アン)

KANJI 174
取 TAKE
MEANING
Take.
REMEMBERING THIS KANJI
The ear was nervous.
“Um…I was wondering…” he said to the ironing board, “if, uh…”
“Yes?”
“If I could, uh…you know, TAKE you…”
“TAKE me where?”
“TAKE you on a…stroll or something.”
The ironing board smiled, and for the first time noticed the ear’s
wrinkles; she understood now that he needed her.
“That would be nice,” she said. “I’d love for you to TAKE me out.”

KANJI 175
村 VILLAGE
MEANING
Village. Here we have the third of our four “community” kanji. Keep in mind
that this character implies something smaller than a city or town.
REMEMBERING THIS KANJI
As the population of our VILLAGE is tiny, the tiny soccer players have
no one to play with. A suggestion that they use trees for opponents,
however, was dismissed by everyone. This was hardly surprising given
that it was proposed by the VILLAGE idiot.

KANJI 176
字 CHARACTER
MEANING
“Character”, in the sense of a Chinese character or letter of an alphabet.
REMEMBERING THIS KANJI
There are various ways of teaching Japanese CHARACTERS to a child,
but a controversial method in days gone by involved the use of pincers. In
it, a set of pincers would be suspended menacingly over a child practicing
kanji. Should a mistake be made with any CHARACTER, the pincers
would…well, best not describe what happened. Learning CHARACTERS
today, quite simply, is a lot less stressful.

COMPONENT 177
SEESAW
KANJI 177
具 TOOL
MEANING
Tool/Equipment.
REMEMBERING THIS KANJI
I once got on a seesaw with a Cyclops and soon found myself stuck in the
air. As he was in no hurry to let me down I had to endure watching him eat
his lunch as I sat there dangling, which was unpleasant given his manners.
Instead of cutlery, he used the only TOOL he had - his club - to do
everything from spread butter to roll up pasta. That being said, though, it
did work well as a cheese grater, so I suppose he had a point in describing
it as a multi-purpose TOOL.

SPLASH
This important component usually indicates a character having some
connection to water. It will be encountered frequently, being present in
more than one hundred of the general-use kanji.
KANJI 178
注 POUR
MEANING
Pour. In addition to the literal meaning, there is often an implied sense of
“directing” something (a gaze or one’s attention, for instance) toward an
object.
REMEMBERING THIS KANJI
This is how I was taught to POUR:
“When you POUR, your primary objective is not to let anything
splash out. POUR carefully, but POUR confidently. Splashes are the
primary indication that someone does not know how to POUR properly.”

KANJI 179
桜 CHERRY TREE
MEANING
Cherry tree.
REMEMBERING THIS KANJI
CHERRY TREES are known to exhibit some odd behavior around
women. When a woman approaches, for example, a CHERRY TREE will
often extend its claws threaten-ingly, and only allow its fruit to be plucked
once certain it will be done with a gentle touch. CHERRY TREES, as
poets have known for centuries, are very delicate.

KANJI 180
里 HAMLET
MEANING
Hamlet. Here we have the fourth and smallest of our populated units. This
character can also signify the countryside in general; not surprisingly, given
how small a settlement this kanji implies.
REMEMBERING THIS KANJI
When Hamlet came to our HAMLET, me ’n the other resident were pretty
darn excited; the guy was the prince of Denmark, after all. Unfortunately,
with only two of us in the HAMLET we only had two fly swatters, and
what with all the flies buzzin’ everywhere, I wasn’t in any mood to lend
him mine. Anyway, rumor has it he told folks back in Elsinore that he
didn’t much care for our HAMLET. Which strikes me as kind of ironic.

KANJI 183
雲 CLOUD
MEANING
Cloud.
REMEMBERING THIS KANJI
Rain and spies are intimately connected with CLOUDS; rain for obvious
reasons, and spies because of their need to operate in CLOUDS of
secrecy. These are likely cumulonimbus as opposed to cirrus CLOUDS,
though, as the latter are too wispy to provide much cover.

KANJI 184
黒 BLACK
MEANING
Black.
REMEMBERING THIS KANJI
The introduction of gas stoves was problematic for our hamlet; nobody
was sure how to cook with them, and a lot of food was burnt beyond
recognition. The inevitable result was that BLACK smoke drifted
everywhere, covering the landscape and hamlet with soot. Residents
began to grumble. “We should go back to the old ways,” some said,
“because these gas stoves are nothing but trouble. It was a BLACK day
when they arrived here”.
COMMON PRONUNCIATIONS

KANJI 185
交 MIX
MEANING
This character conveys a general sense of things mixing in both physical and
figurative ways (“associating” with people or “exchanging” words are
examples of the latter).
REMEMBERING THIS KANJI
My father was a police officer who enjoyed throwing MIXERS. Such
occasions would always draw an interesting MIX of ranks: corporals,
constables, inspectors…they all attended. My father, however, would not
let anyone else MIX the drinks. “The last thing anyone wants,” he said to
me, “is a MIX-up with all these guns around.”

it’s NOT a figure skater. It’s just… NOT like anything, really.

KANJI 187

MEANING
After/Later/Behind. These meanings apply to the ideas of both physical
location and time.
REMEMBERING THIS KANJI
A butcher’s lament:
“Am I frustrated? Yeah, I’m frustrated. I just spent an hour chasing
AFTER a running chicken with a razor. Why? ’Cause a customer
wanted shaved chicken, that’s why! And then AFTER I got it for them,
they complained about the taste of the AFTER shave!”

COMMON PRONUNCIATIONS
Common ON readings: KŌ (コウ); GO (ゴ)
Common kun readings: ato (あと); ushi (うし)
This can be a tough character to master, but is not as fearsome as might be
expected given its many readings. Look for KŌ in the first position; ato and
ushi·ro (this reading is always accompanied by ro) appear far less frequently
here, and GO pops up in only a few words. In second position, morever, the
reading will invariably be GO.
It is worth having another look at the compounds for “前” in Chapter 7
(Entry 133), to see how the fourth, fifth and sixth examples given there “pair
up” with the three below.

MEANING
Most. Note how the first stroke of “ear” has been lengthened.
REMEMBERING THIS KANJI
So the ear was finally able to take the ironing board on a date, and luckily
for him it turned out to be the MOST wonderful, MOST picturesque day.
Not to mention the MOST romantic, too, for when the sun grew overly
hot, the ear stretched himself out so that the ironing board would be
shaded. He really was a MOST chivalrous ear when it came to taking care
of a date.

comes to SCHOOL, some argue, coniferous and deciduous trees simply
cannot mix.

A warning: never try to SEPARATE the squirrels, as they will offer
violent resistance should you try. The police once made an effort, of
course, but the squirrels SEPARATED them from their weapons and
committed an act of such unspeakable evil that it cannot be related here.
The police then sent in a gorilla to do their dirty work, but as the broken

everyone was forced to agree that it was best not to SEPARATE the
squirrels at all.
