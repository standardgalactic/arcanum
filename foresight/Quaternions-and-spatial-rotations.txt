By virtue of their special algebraic structures, Pythagorean-hodograph (PH) curves offer 
unique advantages for computer-aided design and manufacturing, robotics, motion control, 
path planning, computer graphics, animation, and related fields. This book offers 
a comprehensive and self-contained treatment of the mathematical theory of PH curves, 
including algorithms for their construction and examples of their practical applications. 
Special features include an emphasis on the interplay of ideas from algebra and geometry 
and their historical origins, detailed algorithm descriptions, and many figures and worked 
examples. The book may appeal, in whole or in part, to mathematicians, computer scientists, 
and engineers.
geometry and computing
As long as algebra and geometry were separated, their progress
was slow and their uses limited; but once these sciences were
united, they lent each other mutual support and advanced rapidly
together towards perfection.
Joseph-Louis Lagrange (1736-1813)

Sir William Rowan Hamilton (1805-1865)
• as a child prodigy, acquired varying degrees of proﬁciency with
thirteen different languages
• appointed Professor of Astronomy at Trinity College, Dublin (age 22)
• theoretical prediction of “conical refraction” by biaxial crystals in 1832
— experimentally veriﬁed the same year
• Hamiltonian mechanics: systematic derivation of equations of motion
for complicated dynamical systems with multiple degrees of freedom
— paved way for development of quantum mechanics
• interpretation of complex numbers as “theory of algebraic couples” —
search for “theory of algebraic triples” led to discovery of quaternions
• latter career devoted to (failed) effort to establish quaternions as the
“new language of science”

there are no three-dimensional numbers
• generalize complex numbers x + y i to 3D numbers x + y i + z j
• basis elements 1, i, j are assumed to be linearly independent
• commutative and associative — exhibit closure under +, −, ×, ÷
• closure =⇒must have i j = a + b i + c j for some a, b, c ∈R
• multiply by i and substitute i2 = −1, i j = a + b i + c j then gives
j = b −ac −(a + bc) i
1 + c2
• =⇒contradicts the assumed linear independence of 1, i, j !

Hurwitz’s theorem (1898) on composition algebras
key property — norm of product = product of norms: |A B| = |A| |B|
commutative law — A B = B A ,
associative law — (A B) C = A (B C)
there are four possible composition algebras, of dimension n = 1, 2, 4, 8
• R (n = 1), real numbers — product is commutative & associative
• C (n = 2), complex numbers — product is commutative & associative
• H (n = 4), quaternions — product is associative, but not commutative
• O (n = 8), octonions — product neither commutative nor associative

fundamentals of quaternion algebra
quaternions are four-dimensional numbers of the form
A = a + ax i + ay j + az k
and
B = b + bx i + by j + bz k
that obey the sum and (non-commutative) product rules
A + B = (a + b) + (ax + bx) i + (ay + by) j + (az + bz) k
A B = (ab −axbx −ayby −azbz)
+ (abx + bax + aybz −azby) i
+ (aby + bay + azbx −axbz) j
+ (abz + baz + axby −aybx) k
basis elements 1, i, j, k satisfy
i2 = j2 = k2 = i j k = −1
equivalently,
i j = −j i = k ,
j k = −k j = i ,
k i = −i k = j

scalar-vector representation of quaternions
set A = (a, a) and B = (b, b) — a, b and a, b are scalar and vector parts
(a, b and a, b also called the real and imaginary parts of A, B)
A + B = ( a + b , a + b )
A B = ( ab −a · b , a b + b a + a × b)
(historical note: Hamilton’s quaternions preceded, but were eventually
supplanted by, the 3-dimensional vector analysis of Gibbs and Heaviside)
A∗= (a, −a) is the conjugate of A
modulus :
|A|2 = A∗A = AA∗= a2 + |a|2
note that
|A B| = |A| |B|
and
(A B)∗= B∗A∗

unit quaternions & spatial rotations
any unit quaternion has the form U = (cos 1
2θ, sin 1
2θ n)
describes a spatial rotation by angle θ about unit vector n
for any vector v the quaternion product
˜v = U v U∗
yields the vector ˜v corresponding to a rotation of v by θ about n
here v is short-hand for a “pure vector” quaternion V = (0, v)
unit quaternions U form a (non-commutative) group under multiplication

rotate vector v by angle θ about unit vector n
decompose v into components parallel & perpendicular to n
v = v∥+ v⊥= (n · v) n + (n × v) × n
v∥unchanged, but v⊥→cos θ (n × v) × n + sin θ n × v
under a rotation of v by θ about n
in terms of quaternions V = (0, v) and U = (cos 1
2θ, sin 1
2θ n) we have
U V U∗= ( 0 , (n · v) n + sin θ n × v + cos θ (n × v) × n )

. . . the three Russian brothers . . .
. . . Following the collapse of the former Soviet Union, the
economy in Russia hit hard times, and jobs were difﬁcult to
ﬁnd. Dmitry, Ivan, and Alexey — the Brothers Karamazov —
therefore decided to seek their fortunes by emigrating to
America, England, Australia . . .

the “troubled origins” of vector analysis
The algebraically real part may receive . . . all values contained on the
one scale of progression of number from negative to positive inﬁnity; we
shall call it therefore the scalar part, or simply the scalar. On the other
hand, the algebraically imaginary part, being constructed geometrically
by a straight line or radius, which has, in general, for each determined
quaternion, a determined length and determined direction in space, may
be called the vector part, or simply the vector . . .
William Rowan Hamilton, Philosophical Magazine (1846)
A school of “quaternionists” developed, which was led after Hamilton’s
death by Peter Tait of Edinburgh and Benjamin Pierce of Harvard. Tait
wrote eight books on the quaternions, emphasizing their applications to
physics. When Gibbs invented the modern notation for the dot and cross
product, Tait condemned it as a “hermaphrodite monstrosity.” A war of
polemics ensued, with luminaries such as Kelvin and Heaviside writing
devastating invective against quaternions. Ultimately the quaternions lost,
and acquired a taint of disgrace from which they never fully recovered.
John C. Baez, The Octonions (2002)

M. J. Crowe, A History of Vector Analysis (1967)
A high level of intensity and a certain ﬁerceness characterized much
of the debate, and must have led many readers to follow it with interest.
. . . Gibbs and Heaviside must have appeared to the quaternionists as
unwelcome intruders who had burst in upon the developing dialogue
between the quaternionists and the scientists of the day to arrive at a
moment when success seemed not far distant. Charging forth, these two
vectorists, the one brash and sarcastic, the other spouting historical
irrelevancies, had promised a bright new day for any who would accept
their overtly pragmatic arguments for an algebraically crude and highly
arbitrary system. And worst of all, the system they recommended was,
not some new system . . . but only a perverted version of the quaternion
system. Heretics are always more hated than inﬁdels, and these two
heretics had, with little understanding and less acknowledgement,
wrenched major portions from the Hamiltonian system and then
claimed that these parts surpassed the whole.

the sad demise of quaternions
E. T. Bell, Men of Mathematics, Hamilton = “An Irish Tragedy”
Hamilton’s Lectures on Quaternions (1853) “would take any
man a twelve-month to read, and near a lifetime to digest . . .”
– Sir John Herschel, discoverer of the planet Uranus
Hamilton’s vision of quaternions as the “universal language”
of mathematical and physical sciences was never realized —
this role is now occupied by vector analysis, distilled from the
quaternion algebra by the physicists James Clerk Maxwell
(1831-1879) and Josiah Willard Gibbs (1839-1903), and the
engineer Oliver Heaviside (1850-1925)

some “dirty secrets” of vector analysis
• there are two fundamentally different types of vector in R3
— polar vectors and axial vectors
• a polar vector v = (vx, vy, vz) becomes (−vx, −vy, −vz) under a
transformation (x, y, z) →(−x, −y, −z) between right–handed and
left–handed coordinate systems — also called a true vector
• an axial vector, such as the cross product a × b, is unchanged under
transformation (x, y, z) →(−x, −y, −z) — also called a pseudovector
• similar distinction exists between true scalars and pseudoscalars,
e.g., (a × b) · c is a pseudoscalar if a, b, c are true (polar) vectors
• vector analysis in R3 does not have a natural specialization to R2
or generalization to Rn for n ≥4

for any θ ∈(α, 2π −α) there are two axes n — in the plane of e⊥, e0 with
equal inclinations to e⊥— about which a rotation by angle θ maps i →v
◦when θ = α or 2π −α, we have n = e⊥or −e⊥, and rotation is
along great circle between i and v;
◦when θ = π, we have n = ± e0, so i executes either a clockwise
or anti–clockwise half-rotation about e0 onto v;

early 20th century: can existence of a fourth dimension, imperceptible to
human senses, explain mysterious psychic and paranormal phenomena?
H. P. Manning, The Fourth Dimension Simply Explained (1910)
& Geometry of Four Dimensions (1914), Dover (reprint), New York.
→strange phenomena arise from “extra maneuvering freedom” in R4

elementary geometry of four dimensions
lines, planes, and hyperplanes of R4 are the sets of points linearly
dependent upon two, three, and four points of R4 in “general position”
alternatively, lines, planes, and hyperplanes are point sets satisfying
three, two, and one linear equations in the Cartesian coordinates of R4
hyperplane = a copy of familiar Euclidean space R3 — separates
R4 into two disjoint regions (as with a plane in R3, and a line in R2)
generic incidence relations for R4 :
◦two hyperplanes intersect in a plane
◦three hyperplanes intersect in a line
◦four hyperplanes intersect in a point
=⇒two planes intersect in a point

“absolutely orthogonal” planes in R4
two planes Π1, Π2 ∈R4 with intersection point p are absolutely orthogonal
if every line through p on Π1 is orthogonal to every line through p on Π2
pairs of “absolutely orthogonal” planes are a strictly four-dimensional
phenomenon — they have no analog in R3
through each point p of a given plane Π1 ∈R4, there is a unique plane
Π2 ∈R4 that is absolutely orthogonal
pairs of absolutely orthogonal planes in R4 play an important role in
characterizing four-dimensional rotations

characterization of rotations in R2, R3, R4
R2 : (x + i y) →eiθ(x + i y) — one parameter, rotation angle θ
R3 : v →U v U∗where U = (cos 1
2θ, sin 1
2θ n)
— three parameters, rotation axis n and angle θ
R4 : V →U1V U∗
2 — two unit quaternions U1, U2 ⇒six parameters
stationary set of rotation in Rn = set of points that do not move
simple rotation in Rn — the stationary set is of dimension n −2
⇒in R2 and R3, every rotation is simple
simple rotation in R4 — stationary set is a plane through the origin,
and unique absolutely orthogonal plane rotates on itself

a new possibility in R4 — double rotations
if Π1, Π2 ∈R4 are absolutely orthogonal planes through the origin, each
may rotate upon itself about the other, and these rotations commute —
i.e., the outcome is independent of their order
the stationary set of such a double rotation is the single common point
of Π1, Π2 — i.e., the origin
of the six parameters describing a general rotation in R4, four deﬁne the
absolutely orthogonal planes Π1, Π2 and two specify the rotation angles
θ1, θ2 associated with them
under a continuous double rotation — with angular speeds ω1, ω2
associated with the absolutely orthogonal planes Π1, Π2 — points in R4
have closed orbits if and only if the ratio ω2/ω1 is a rational number

Clifford algebra: extensions from R2, R3 to Rn
and from Euclidean to Minkowski space
consider “n–dimensional numbers” x = x1e1 + · · · + xnen
where x1, . . . , xn ∈R and (e1, . . . , en) = orthonormal basis for Rn
eiei = σi = ±1
and

write Cℓp,q if σ1 = · · · = σp = +1, σp+1 = · · · = σn = −1
Cℓn,1 equivalent to Minkowski space Rn,1 (special relativity theory)

graded algebra — e.g., general element of Cℓ3 is the multivector
a0 + a1e1 + a2e2 + a3e3 + a23e2e3 + a31e3e1 + a12e1e2 + a123e1e2e3
• 1 is grade zero element (scalar)
• e1, e2, e3 are grade one elements (vectors)
• e2e3, e3e1, e1e2 are grade two elements (bivectors)

medial axis = locus of centers of maximal inscribed disks, touching
domain boundary in at least two points; medial axis transform (MAT)
= medial axis + superposed function specifying radii of maximal disks

Minkowski Pythagorean-hodograph (MPH) curves in R2,1
medial axis of planar domain D = locus of centers of maximal disks
(touching domain boundary ∂D in at least two points) inscribed in D
medial axis transform or MAT (x(t), y(t), r(t)) = medial axis locus
(x(t), y(t)) plus function r(t) specifying radii of maximal disks
MAT encodes and characterizes shape of any planar domain D
MAT is a Minkowski Pythagorean-hodograph (MPH) curve in R2,1 if
x′2(t) + y′2(t) −r′2(t) = σ2(t)
MAT = MPH curve ⇐⇒domain boundary ∂D can be
exactly recovered as a (piecewise) rational curve

interpretation of Minkowski metric
originates in special relativity: distance d between events with
space–time coordinates (x1, y1, t1) and (x2, y2, t2) is deﬁned by
d2 = (x2 −x1)2 + (y2 −y1)2 −c2(t2 −t1)2
space-like if d real, light-like if d = 0, time-like if d imaginary
distance between circles (x1, y1, r1) and (x2, y2, r2) as points in R(2,1)
d2 = (x2 −x1)2 + (y2 −y1)2 −(r2 −r1)2

d = 0
d imaginary

closure
• quaternions offer natural language for describing & manipulating
spatial rotations
• the quaternion model allows simple and intuitive constructions
of spatial Pythagorean-hodograph curves
• the historical legacy of quaternions (origins of vector analysis)
has been sadly neglected
• complexity of rotations in R4 provides cautionary evidence
against extending geometric intuition from R2 and R3
• Clifford algebra formulations: extension to higher dimensions,
and from Euclidean →Minkowski space

man’s limited insight
Superior beings, when of late they saw
A mortal man unfold all nature’s law,
Admired such wisdom in an earthly shape,
And showed a Newton as we show an ape.
Could he, whose rules the rapid comet bind,
Describe or ﬁx one movement of his mind?
Who saw its ﬁres here rise, and there descend,
Explain his own beginning, or his end?
Alas, what wonder! Man’s superior part
Unchecked may rise, and climb from art to art:
But when his own great work has but begun,
What reason weaves, by passion is undone.
Alexander Pope (1688-1744), Essay on Man

Boolean algebra of poets & fools
Sir, I admit your general rule,
That every poet is a fool.
But you yourself may serve to show it,
That every fool is not a poet!
Alexander Pope (1688-1744)
