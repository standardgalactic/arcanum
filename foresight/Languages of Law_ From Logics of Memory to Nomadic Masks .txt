origi~al and comprehensive study 
of the history, symbols and .'an~uages. of the c?m~on law 
tradition. The first part of this stimulating contribution to 
modern legallheory. 'Memory, Pr~ede nt an~ the 
Writing Systems of Law', is a detaIled analysIs of the 
development of legal language from ~he emergence of a 
legal curriculum at the Inns of Court In the second half of 
the sil(teenlh century to the present day. The study 
examines the technological. professional and polemical 
contexts of the emergence of legal writing as a distinctiw 
system of inscription and documentation. The language 
and symbols of the common law tradition are shown to 
form a logic of memory, and a linguistics of fealty to 
established practices. It expresses itself as a faith In relics 
and in patterns of repetition. 
The second part, "Language, Image, Sign and Common 
Law'. moves from historical to substantive analysis. Each 
chapter presents a method of analysis and case studies of 
specific texts.' The argument moves from the oral language 
of courtroom diCllogue to the textual language of reported 
judgments. The final chapters concentrate on the visual 
legitimacy and symbols of law, and advance an original 
theory of the acceptance of law as a question of the 
imagery and aesthetics of legal representation. 
This is a book for students of legal history, lega! system 
and legal method. jurisprudence and sociology of law, 
and for students of the history of language.

PREFACE 
The common law has presented itself historically as a system 01 
memories: the law i5 tradition and it is precedent but more than that il 
is immemorial usage; it is practice reverting to 'time out of mind', 
custom that language alone remembers. If the authority of law is 
predicated upon the repetition ofpractiees that exceed the memory of 
man, those practices have the status of law by virtue of the form of 
their custody, by virtue that is of the institutional language of 
tradition. It is for that reason that the language oflaw has always been 
presented as being more than mere language and other than the 
simple vernacular. It is, in doctrinal terms, the language of tradition 
as such, a veridical language that not only carries a store of ideal 
meanings but is also itselfa model for all other forms oflanguage. The 
language oflaw is depicted as a language of record, a perfect language 
that harbours true reference, that corresponds to real events, that is 
itself a monument, a memorial, a vestige or a relic of previous wisdom 
and prior judgment. The inhabitants of the legal institution are thus 
custodians not only of a tradition of rules and of texts but also of 
linguistic forms and of techniques of interpretation that will unlock 
the memories oflegallanguage. Within the language of tradition the 
lawyer is supposed to uncover the forms of life and of ethical practice 
that tht institution was established to record and repeal. The 
institution was not only to reproduc~ the memorials r)f an authorised 
life, thr rdiquary of which legal language was {he register, but it was 
also, a, :, lived and living tradition, to produce, to create new forms. 
Th . . <q,.:ument of this bo-ok is that the common L,W tradition has

common Law it is apparent above all else that the common Law has 
repressed the productive power of the plan; it has failed to understand 
or transmit an understanding of the memorial language as a code, as 
an index of lived existence, of historical forms that cannot· be 
emulated but must be transformed, reinterpreted, repeated in the 
genuine sense of the pn,ctice of tradition, which is to say taken up as 
an object both of COfIversation and conversion. Th ~ narrative that this 
study takes up is the narrative of an insular tradition, a history in 
which the common Law denied any authoritative place to scholarly 
commentary or intellectual interpretation of the tradition. There is no 
place in the common law institution for a j urisprudence that 
genuinely interprets as opposed to merely systematises the tradition, 
In that sense the tradition is one of decay: it exists not as an historical 
form but as the decaying serue of the in3titution, a mute pattern of 
emulation and of imitation, The memories and techniques of the 
common law abolish the distance necessary to interpretation, and 
through denying any institutional place to an intellectual discourse of 
commentary the tradition comes to treat memory as pure surface: as a 
collection of images without depth or reference. as viuual forms oflife. 
monuments, models, mementoes, 
The surface ofa tradition is its language and that language is only 
ever an index, a ruin of a structure, of a lived past and of the order 
appropriate to it. In denying any place to scholarship and to history 
the common law tradition clOsc:5 the possibility of dialogue with tbe 
past and ironically uses memory as the means of forgetting: the 
memorial or monumental language is precisely a language outside of 
lived time and it3 material sitOl, detached from the possibility of any 
Clitial account of tbe fealties of things to their place:. The common 
law does not represent or remem ber the past; it rcpeats it by living it, 
it suppresses it through the immobiie memory of the mirror, through 
duplication. The order of rules becomes the order of things but it is an 
order that is superimposed upon the living so as to render it 
b.:>mogeneous, a rt:productiOfl, an image in the glass. The present 
study endeavours to undentand the religious life of the law, of the 
institution, as an historical ruin, as the legible surface or marked text 
of a lived worLd. The structures of positive law are mobile structures; 
they exul to be dec;onStrucled, to be reinhabited, to be read and so to 
be changed.

The mOfe radical tendency of contemporary critical legal studies has

abstract forms of jurisprudence. The old theories, the sullenly 
descriptive theories of 'Jaw in general', the political jurisprudence 
that would offer programmes, maps of how legal studies mould be 
conducted, in short the jaded pedagogy of theory:1 the patronising 
The didactic con~pli(H1 of theory is di:nilKlivc for its clIlcmaiiution oflhe

INTRODUCTION 
dogmas of the truth, of what ought to be faught, have given way to 
critical theories of the particular. Critical legal theory might well 
<;orne eventually to be defined as the theory of particular laws,l,its 
concern being to read and re-read what FouCault (following Kant) 
termed the 'conditions of possibility' of particular texts, legal teXts, 
and here the texts of the common law. In this form, theory is f10t 
concerned with the classical bLit intrinsically uninteresting questions 
of what law in general is, or with how one can acquire an objective 
knowledge oflaw, bUI rather with the historical and ontological is.ue 
of how law is lived, what are its habitual forms, what is the deep 
structure that allows its re~tition in ever different forms. 
I 
leit is anything 'in general', Western law is tradition, the tradition 
of inescapable institutions and of institutional life. I t has a history ~ut 
much more it has memories: narratives of an habitual past bein~ of 
the essence oflegal justificatory argument as a discourse of precedent. 
Tbe logic oflaw could well be presented as a structure ofmemoh', 
while a rhetoric of the immemorial and of the remembered is dle 
stylistic key to the authority of legal texts. The first part of the present 
work, 'Memory, Precedent and Writing Systems of Law', is concer-
ned with the forms that legal memory takes: with its repetition, it~ 
inscription, its representation. To_ the :},hstri£L!1ll:roqri~s_ 9f~h~ 
archive we have ther Ii e to a 
the oral memories ofljved lawJ_lhe 
insignia of regeljlion as -the law relent ess y ID abits everyday 
in:nitutional <:xj~teoce. The theory of legal memory has to take 
account not simply of the opposition between the oral and the 
scriptural as law, but equally of the structure of memory, of how the 
body remembers, of how the emotional body is made s.ubject to law. 
That is a question of mnemonics and of the aesthetics of law, a 
question of the oral and of the visual quite as much as it is of the text 
and the abstract authority ofa scripture. The first part of the work 
thus examines the nature of a particular tradition, that of the common 
law, and analyses the practical and material forms that this tradition 
has taken: what are its ritllals, its repetitions, its texts, its symbols, its

kll$, its other media of circulation and inscription? These a~ 
questions which Derrida has linked to-the question of writing In 
general, th:u of grammatology or the history and science of all ~~s 
of graphic inscription.' In grammalological terms the legal tradition, 
as we have inherited it, is a product of the technology of print. For that 
feason the historical materials ell3mined in the coune of Part One of 
this study concentrate on the sixteenth and early seventeenth 
centuries, on the legal literature and curricula manuals, the first 
printed. materials, the first widely available and visible (though less 
often legible) teXtual artefacts of the common law world. 
An analysis of the malenal form's through which English law has 
been memorised, and more significandy 'presenced', necessarily 
;~ -tails an analysis of language. It is language in the end which 
remembers, it fS language which bears tradition and it is through 
language, through the dense prose of the text, or through the 
rhythm of the oral history thai we remember not

I Crammatology lIudies the history of systenu of insuiption: 'if "writing"

you first ap~red before the law? Not only what did you wear, how 
did you speak, what time Wll5 it, whose time was it, but also where 
were you, before which tradition of the law, in front of which bench, in 
view of which insignia and what icons oflegal presence? What ~'ntury 
is this, what present? 
The question of language, which must now be taken to include all 
the other systems of signs - of architecture, dress, geography, 
cen=mony, aura and technology - that accompany legal tradition, 
that prejudge the text as a legal text, the spoken word as the word of 
the law, that question ofJanguage is the question of the institution. To 
ask what tradition is this, is to ask what institution, whal fonn ofliA, 
-what road to death?TIle$e a~ again questionsofmemory, the issue is 
that of how does one come to know a tradition, an institution, a 
particular law? The most general thesis presented in this study 
approaches. that issue of tradition on two levels. At the everyday level 
oftraditioo as a form oflife, the legal tradition is? secular version of

tradition 
tradition takes the form of the argument that the moralistic 
common law, its antipathy towards desire, is necessarily 
to its 
forms of memory, its imaginary histories, its particular quality of 
traditionalism. In the Ph.iltbus Plato links desire to memory and to the 
representation of pleasure. Foucault, in his commentary on t.he 
Ph.iltbuJ, depicts Plato as concluding that 'the appetite . . ~ can be 
aroused only by the rep~ntation , the image or the memory of the 
thing that gives pleasu~; he conclude~ that theI;e can be no desire

knowl«lges of England's (u:lf-prod aimed) 'third university'. At a 
deeper level his failure to fit in was an institutional question, a failun~ 
that left its mark on the , tradition that developed in the early 
seventeenth century. Ffllunce could not succeed because the English 
profession had no institutional site or role for a discourse of 
scholarship and of interpretation of the law. There was no jurispru-
dence in the continental sense, no scholars ofthe: common law whose 
labour could be:: put to use in the legalsyslem itse.lr. The tradition that 
developed over the disappearance of Fraunce's work is marked 
preduly by the absence of any place, any site or instituriooal role. for 
scholanhip and interpretation in its stronger senses. It is not a 
tradition that encourages thought, let alone comparative, historical ,

Fraunce's rather plebeian and puritanical concern with a logic of o~r

The divine presence oflaw is not a novel idea in either the common 
law or the civilian traditions. Its role, however, is always a specific 
one. In the common law tradition there was never any successful 
political revolution to challenge the place of Coke's 'spirit of the law' 
and its sacral texts. The Anglican legal tradition came to embody 
both the divine and the'seeular laws; the common law effectively 
absorbed the other jurisdiction in the same manner that the Crown-

It is a tit faeto union, something that happened and continues to 
happen, iIln unwrinen constitution, a constitution undisturbed by any 
formal constrain! or requirement of justificatory discourse that will 
measure up to constitutional rules of reason or rational debate. ~n 
that sense it is purely English, a tacit form of law, a traditiori of 
manners, a tyrannically repressed jurisdiction. In Chapter Four we 
examine the only available evidence of an English legal constitution, 
namely the writing systems and textual forms oflaw that were made 
explicit with the advent ofprint, What were the rules of compositwn, 
of circulation, of sending and of receipt of these texts; what theory of 
language unified them and made them into the memories, the 
monuments of common law? What explicit or implicit fealtiCj of 
meaning, what textual fidelities have marked the law in the absence of 
any constitution, in the absence of any tradition of commentary or 
jurisprudence of interpretation, in the absence of any institutionally 
empowered legal scholarship, in the presence of a law predicated 
upon pure practice?· 
. 
The question of meaning has always been a question of law, a 
question of the legitimacy of reference, of faith in the linguistic 
encoding of reality. faith in the capacity of words to act as the notation 
of things. The faith attributed to and nc:assary for the working of any 
nistenC language system is a question of its legitimacy; the lawfulness 
not only of its reference but alsoofits use is predicated upon its source, 
its institutional provenance, its badge or other insignia of office. In 
Chapter Five we move to question that legitimaey, to deco~tr~ct i.ts

legal and political feason. Making usc of the example of the 
contractual basis of all social forms and so of all communication, an 
example dear to Hooker and the Anglican IraditiOlt, we mov(: to 
deconstruct that unifying myth of an agreed sociality, a contracted 
meaning and law. Making use of the most sophisticated of tbe 
proponents of social contract theory, namely JeanJacques Rousseau, 
it is possibk to trace within the contract and its theory of ongin and 
transmission a residual linguistic theology, a contractarian semantics 
which at one of its root!! po!its a law prior to language, an ordu of 
contract which precedes the agreement of reference that is noted in 
words, a covenant that ls prior 10 bOlh speech and wriling, an 
absolute law. The law continues to haunt the languages of con-
temporaneity, chat contract ,till bold, US; it is the instiu,uion we

less contracting subjects of law than contracted relics, spectral forms 
of an Enlightenment project that hislor), has overtaken and·over-
turned, requires a remapping of the entire process of reading

INTRODUCTION 
same time frightening about the law is precisely that it is integral to 
el!;perience, that it is everywhere present, nOI as command or facile 
rule but rather as an architccture of daily life, a law of Ihe street, an 
insidious imaginary. In terms of any phenomenology o( the law in iu 
forms of dail y life, we would need to study the images of possibility, 
the imagery, (he emotive and affecti"e bonds that tie the legal subject 
quite willingly, though not nccc!l.Sarily happily, 10 the limits of law; to 
thi3 biography, to this persona, 10 this body and these organs. In 
Chapter Eight the question of the aesthetics of law, the question of 
emotive adhesion to law, to all that law implies, is approached 
through the work of the French classicist and historian of medieval 
law, Pierre Legendre. His theory encompasses a politics ofthe images 
oflaw, an account of the forms of montage through which the law is 
presenced in social life. · The issue is One of the assemblage of 
images through which we live our faith in the social and political 
bond, our fidelity to the legality of social speech, and to all the 
discourses through which a technologically advanced society car-
penters and reproduces an everyday life. The analysis of Legendre'S 
concept of an aesthetics of law provides the background and 
terminology through which, in the concluding chapter, we analyse a 
series of contemporary images of lived law. 
The detailed attention given to Legendre's aesthetics orlaw reflccts 
the novelty of the task ahead. The notion of taking the 'art of law' 
5eriously as an arl, as a system of representations and visual symbols, 
is quite foreign to modem jurisprudence. White English jurispru-
dence has in the distant past paid cons»derable attenuon to visual 
dimensions oflegal texts and more particularly oflegal proof, that is 
not a tradition which survived the transition from the ocular to the 
optic, from a scribal culture of illuminated and glossed texts, of the 
book as a metaphor for heavenly decree, to the logistics of the 
moveable typeface and the printed text. The antique tradition of 
common law that is invoked by Fortescue and Coke is frcquently a 
visually dramatic discipline as well as being violent in its evidentiary 
and verbal forms. Its texts were 'mirrors' of the law; its forms of proof 
acted out or recollected the acting out of earlier demonstrations of 
ownership through testamentary signs and icons oftide. The various 
forms of religious trial by ordcal, of proof through divination, 
profoundly influenced common law procedures, not simply in,the 
trial of witches or in proof of contested honour bUT more extensively in

·the very use of documentation as an iconic fonn ofproof. 1 The tactical 
.. quality of legal aesthetics, the continuing and pervasive visual 
symbolism of the law in its broadest sense, the law as twmJJS or norm 
and Jimil of the socially possible, remains to be studied in its 
rontemporary or historical (orms. 
Building upon the work of Legendre, the final chapter presents a 
duailed analysis of the work of one artist. Its thesis is that, in the wake 
of the brt"..ak-up of earlier modernist and contractarian notions of 
society and law, ofmeaning and of rule, jurisprudence would do well 
to return to the study of the art of law; the representations oflegality-
of legitimacy -
have become the reality, the only reality, of 
postmodern culture. To punue that argument requires that we 'look' 
at specific images and trace not simply the law of our vision2 but 
equally the presuppositions of the images themselves. They are 
images of a law that has broken down, that has fragmented, but in 
ever more powerful and arbitrary forms: it is a law of masks, of 
nomadic moveable signs that terroristically invade the intensive 
zones of everyday life. The law of the image, where the sign plays thc 
law, where the sign organises the very content of daily hfe - that I 
SU3ptC.t is the future oflaw, Government in such a context, in such a 
culture, is a matter of moving the signs, of controlling the avenues of 
circulation of images, of intercepting the hallucinated messages of the 
microchip age. 115 law is the law of the image, the law of the sign. It is 
a moveable law, a collapsible structure, its hermeneutic that of simple 
survival. In the place of the logiC! of memory we now find, we now 
glimpse, the intimations of another law, a pragmatically nomadic law 
that fixes itsdf to the momentary apparitions of the various SCtttnS, 
the tdevisual apparatuses ofposl-COntractarian communications.

Failure and the Positive Unconscious of aScience: 
Abraham Fraunce 
I will begin with the history of a failure. It is the history of a discipline 
that did not come into being. It is a history that did not occur, or at 
least that has yet to happen. If! therefore invoke an imaginary past, a 
fictional lineage or, beuer, a tradition that was never transmitted, it is 
for good reasons. In the first place there is the romanticism of failure, 
the attraction of loss, even of nemesis, to the melancholic spirit of a 
postmodern age. Why study success. in other words, when the realm 
of 
ssibilities is infinite! more vast, more varied and arguabl more 
~nticil1i? Which possible disciplines oflaw fe 
y t e wayside, outside 
of their destiny, beyond the custody of institutional transmission? 
Who interpreted them out of existence, and why? 
In a deeper, structural sense the last question can be posed in a 
more specific way. If a particularly interdisciplinary conception of 
law as a discipline2 never saw the light of institutional acceptance, ifit

its object and more s~cifically the tradition of its recollection and

tran.!lmwion, inevitably incorporates a positive mootl or repraenla· 
tion of the Iega] discipline as a curriculum, and as an order, but it also 
presupposes that which method (leaching) and order have excluded, 
a n:pressed subjeet matter, a failed content or form. The language of 
law carries with it all that is unsaid, that has been driven within, 
hidden from view: it carries its failures within as an indelible past, as 
the memory of battle, as litigation. In a broader sense, the materiality 
of language is always excessjve; it carries with it far more than is

comes to lost causes in relation to law. To trace the undenide ofa 
discipline - to ask what it cost - is to recuperate the specific motive 
fca" that underlie the form or life, the weaknesses that border any 
science conceived as truth, the excluded lives, the solitary figures, the 
ashes of those who were burnt in the name oflaw.1t is notjuSl t~at 
myth or irrationality are the necessary boundaries, the limits, of a 
science, but also that the underside, the failures, the other history ofa 
discipline, provides a ground for reinterpretation. A tradition i, a 
fbrm or language oftransmi5.!lion; it sends on and its surface is in that 
sense a temporal one: through t«hniques of repetition, recycling and 
reinterpretation it establishes sites of temporal recurn:nce, cycle! or 
recognition, places on a map of the law's progression. The pauem'of 
such development, of the common law as tradition, is most usually 
presented as one oflinear emergence: the law is a route, a path across. 
time and across experience; it is simply the way or schedule by which 
time is lived. We will return on many occasions to the nomadic 
temporal quality of the common law tradition. At the moment we 
would simply observe that the existence of a path or route is, in 
cartographic terms, a matter of projection, of perspective across a 
landscape or of a route across the .seas. The failed history maps 
another path, a cross wind on the trade route, a possibility. In this 
text, however, it will be followed as a possible site of criticism, as an 
outside Ihat is within the law as a mark, a trace element, a break in the 
road. To appreciate the alternative that such a history, such a reading 
of the law as language, allows, consider the nature of the tradilion 
itself. 
.

possibilities, oflanguage, including the anguage of the body: it is aD

meanings jn tht: act of establishing literal or artistic legal terms. It is 
constgut:ntly an insider knowledge. language or shjbbQleth3, of

access 10 it; it will involve being within itS circle and bound to iu 
purpose, at leau in the grammatical senst: or understanding it as a 
language ;tnd of being familiar with its usages. To criticise the law if 
one lives through the law is a circular and unproductive activity; it is 
always likely that one docs not so much escape it as return to it. The 
value of failure, of the non-occurring history, is thus precisely the 
value of the outside within: it provides, perhaps it alone provides, the 
possibility ofa criticism that inhabits a place both outside the law and

genres, lead us away or bring us back, but always on our own terms, ; 
from a perspective that is free of specific institutional co-option, that IS ! 
not yet complicit, not yet quite legal prose. 
The figure of failure to be followed in this chapter is that of 
Abraham Fraunce, a rhetorician trained at Cambridge University, a 
poet, logician and secular iconographer as wdl; a Renaissance man 
who moved in the early 1~80s to Lincoln's Inn and studied the law, 
Littleton's Tenures, the breviaries, the Year Books, the forensic 
rhetorical manuals, in short the curriculum - such as it was _ at the 
Inns of Court in the second half of the sixteenth century. The 
forgonen history or decayed memory is that of his single and 
reluctantly published analysis and criticism of the common law and 
its representatives~ the history- the oblivion ~ ofhis work the Lawur's 
Logue, published in 1588. The history also, the fate, of a specific 
.. critique of the common law and its method, in which hi:!Uory can be 
read in nuCl the exemplary historical destiny of an auempt' to 
introduce to the common law an historical and comparative di..J 
mension of criticism, an attempt to link law to knowledge,· to! 
contemporary philosophy, to a non-dogmatic reason or dialectic. Inl 
both intellectual and political terms, Fraunce's project was a complex 
and ambitious one. In intdlectual terms, he presented the first 
systematisation of English law that took account of disciplines and' 
traditions other than that of common law, which was cognisant oflhe: 
history of other legal systems and that was well versed in both Eugl.ish . 
and contin~ntallheoreticaltradi(jons. His references range from thc 
Greek and Roman oratol"S to Aristotle and the various medieval 
versions of scholasticism. His examples are drawn from the law 
reports and the institutions :lnd opinions of English lawyers, but also 
from thecontinental civilian C9mmentatoT5, from Hotman, Cujas and 
Bude, the historians, the linguists and the poets of European 
literature. His style is similarly extensive; it draws upon the 
tech.niques of forensic rhetoric as then current in the Inns of Court, 
but It also travcls much further to embody elements of Ramist logic, , 
historical philology, arcadian lyricism and vernacular humour. It is a 
critical and eclectic style appropriate, one might argue, to the 
founding of a new discipline. In political or institutional terms, 
Fraunce was also ambitious. His critique of the legal knowledge oChis 
day must be understood as an attack upon a 'dark' and secret

In subsequent chapters we will look in detail a~ the paradigm of

Renaissance vernacularisation of the disciplines, and the sciences, 
The uwilr's utikt is an aspect of its pre-history;' it attempts at the 
time of inception of a discipline to challenge the paradigm that is 
being established and to draw legal reason t~wards. a different

shallow and haphazard insularity of the common law, i!s base

reworked SO as 10 attack it. In some comKl.erable measure the themes 
ofhis book are the themes orhi. life and our narrative will conftate the. 
two: what is lived - what is spoken - and what is written. 
We can begin then by observing that Fn.unce went to Cambridge 
to study literature, attending the lectures of G~briel Harvey and 
being fellow student and colleague ofDudJey Fenn~r, respectively the 
authors of the first English commentary on Ram,:,s' Rhewric and the 
first translation of his work on dialectic, the LtJgw: In the early 15805 
Fraunce composed the Shepherd's LtJgike, an English Ramistic logic 
'setting out the praise and right use of logic'2 and providing a 
rendering and comparison of Ramus' LtJgikt with that of Aristotle, 
while still at the university, Soon after the publication of thaI work he

scholarly rather than venal or professional is of some considerable 
signi6canu. It defined Fraunce as an outsider; it made him live as a

.attemion sinct: it is)naugural of both Fraunce's work and his life: 'for

of.law or that a philologist could lay bare ils languages. In a thinly

university men who, in Ihe opinion of those wise in the law, 'can; 
let 
make new found verses of Amyntas' death, and popular discoUfS 
of 
ensigns, armoury, emblems, hieroglyphs and lIalian impresses, than

again to harangue the emptinesa oflegal education. the spuriou,riess 
of legal learning. the greedy 'and foolish sophistry of the aveJge

ethics that learning would bring to counter the Jaw of the market

is not simply a morality, it is habitual and comprehensive: through 
the law men should lurn to desire, through repetition and through 
learning, todo the right thing in the right place at,the right time; they 
should come to desirejustice and as lawyers their lives should embody 
a lrue law, a lived law, authenticjusti~ pragmatically located in a 
specific place and time. England in the last quarter of the fifteenth 
century, the England of tenures and fealties, of villeinage and socage, 
of deodand, advowson and frankalmoign. It was precisely customary 
law, the tradition of habitual bodies and habitual lives, that would be. 
lost if 'ungentle' and ignorant lawyers were allowed to continue to 
peddle mere rules, norms that simply existed in writing, mores that 
had no inner or lived content. The time had come, in other words, to 
take account of the modem world and its episteme, to recognise the 
possibilities or knowledge. of Renaissance learning, and (0 discard.an 
opaque law that was in danger of propounding little more than 
historical archaisms, the mores of forgotten times and abandoned 
plaa:s, a dead 'Norman' law, an abstract justice unbound to any 
s ecific time or lace unbound to an 
articular life. I t is the 
commona ity of common law t at Frauna: saw as being most visibly, 
and .immediately threatened, and by implication it is the ,socius, the 
relationships that make up a shared habitual world, a life, that were in 
danger of being destroyed. Be:hind Fraunce's critique of what could 
bt: termed an official or state-run black economy in misunderstood 
legal terms is a concern to reinstate the time and place of English law 
as a modern, national discipline, a discipline bound to England. 
Ifwe move to ask what the university or scholarship had to offer to 
law, the question is necessarily particular to the brand ofscholarship 
then current and to the Lawur',s UJti/e, as an embodiment or 
development of that currency. Two themes were for present purposes 
intrinsic to Fraunce's work and intertextual in the Logib: the need to 
develop a national language adequate to the new disciplines; and the 
need to re-read and rework the classics, Aristotle and Cicero, so as to 
Anglicise the Helleniscic or scholastic tradition while also incorporat· 
ing contemporary and international theoretical discourses. As 
regards the former concern, that of developing English as a national 
language of the new disciplines, of the disciplines made legible by 
print, Fraunce adopts but does not greatly extend a much more 
general concern that preoccupied all of the arts of his day. His 
contemporary at Cambridge, Dudley Fenner, provides one example 
of a similar project in the form of a translation and annotation of

work was one of many which strove to create a context In which It was 
possible to assume the desirability of a specifically English and 
frequently nationalistic presentation of continental traditions of 
scholarship. It was a, mbvement that, according to Fenner in the 
preface to his Upt, had 'already -brought all the arts into French, 
Dutch and almost into English; and that by the hand of the most 
cunningest workmen'. 2 
The most extreme, though not atypical example of such cunning 
workmanship must undoubtedly have been Ralph Lever's The Artt of 
Rtason, Rightly Termed Witcrafi. Teaching_ a Ptrfect Way to Argue and 
Disputt, published in 1573 and devoted to 'proving that the art of 
reason can be taught in English'. He further observes in the 
Forespeache (i.e. preface) that 'for devising of new terms, and 
compounding of words, ,our tongue hath a special grace, wherein it 
excelleth many other, and is comparable with the best. The cause is 
for that the most part of English words are short and stand on one 
syllable a piece.'3 Lever proceeded to devise an entire vocabulary of 
English neologisms, a complete vernacular lexicon of logical terms, 
free of any rude, foreign or 'inkhorne' terms. The result is linguistic-
ally remarkable mainly for its inelegance. Aristotle's definition of 
substance and accident becomes, to take one example: 'substance is 
an inholder, the very groundwork, stay and upholder of quantities, 
qualities and other inheers'. It is sufficient to note that Lever's specific 
project failed in the sense that the artificial language of inheers 
(accidents), inholders (subjects), endsays (conclusions) and the like 
did not gain philosophical acceptance. His broader championship of 
English, however, was a commonplace theme of his qay and it is one 
that Fraunce specifically takes up and extends not only in presenting 
an English language logic oflaw but also in expanding and critically 
revising the continental tradition being so presented. Fraunce's 
project thus did not stop, as did Fenner's, with the relatively limited 
though none the less important notion of a literal translation of 
continental dialectic into an English logic. The translation has also to

be critical and conceptual: it was not to be assumed that an inherited 
post-classicill vocabulary should take precedence over critical con-
sideration of the etymology of artistic or technical terms; it was not to 
be assumed that the contemporary continental logic with which 
Fenner, Fraunce and others were concerned was free of mistakes or 
interpolations. In an exactly similar sense, the comparative use that 
Fraunce makes of civilian law does not assume any priority of 
method, elegance or order to either one of the systems. Injust such a 
vein he observes: 
[S]ome will say that the civil is more constant and philosophic than, and 
also by Justinian more methodically, and by later writers more 
eloquently put down. Yet: they have plebiscita, senatus consulta, 
principium placita, magistratum edicta, responsa prudentum: we have 
cases, maxims and principles, customs; and usages both general and 
special; and lastly, continual reforms of new abused statutes and Acts of 
Parliament. As for Justinian'S method, it does not so content the 
civilians, but that they daily contend with new innovations and 
continua! printing offresh method, to bring it to better order. 
His conclusion is appropriately damning of the rudeness of style of 
both the professions: 'while one can easily observe that both styles 
and methods are bad, it is hard to judge which is worse'.l 
The translation of continental logic and the devising ofa properly 
English logic is thus aimed to draw the law towards a body of 
kn9wledge that it had previously eschewed; it was to equip the 
1,]yerS with technical philosophica:l (9r, more properly, argumenta-
tiv ) tools and thereby to recognise England as a part of the European 
tra ition, to accept, in Fulbecke's words, that 'the common law 
cannot be divided from the civil and canon laws [any more] than the 
flower from the root and stalk'.2 The inception of a logic of common 
law, an Englishjurisprudence, cannot be understood for Fraunce in 
terms of an insular nationalism: the new discipline is rather to be 
comprehended as a national genre of a European species, a federal 
enterprise within the legal philosophic tradition and the ius commune, 
the common law of Europe. So too, for Fraunce, English scholarship 
could exist only by relating the particularities of an existent 
discipline, the writings and reports of Bracton, Brookes, Bryttan,

Plowden, Stamford and all the rest, together with the language of 
gard, villein, monmain, wapentakes and gavelkind, to a method of 
reasoning and to comparab!e institutional literatures. As regards the 
philosophic tradition and specifically that of logic, Fraunce's 
references span the classics, Aristotle, Plato, Cicero, Laertius and 
their reception in Renaissance Europe in the work afValla, Talon, 
Philip Sydney and most particularly Ramus. For specific compari-
sons with the legal literature of the civilian reception the references 
are equally expansive and inclusive, particulady of Hatman, Cujas 
and Bude, the leading legal philologists and scholars of his era. As to 
the use to which his breadth of learning, of reading, was put it is 
necessary first to comment brieRy upon the English intellectual 
context (or intertextuality) that plays in the background, that is the 
backgame of Frau nee's work. Of the lawyers and the limited tradition 
of rhetorical and formulary scholarship that accompanied the 
essentially oral learning process at the Bar more will be said in the 
next chapter. I 
The inception of a specifically English tradition of scholarship and 
of the individual disciplines was initially a linguistic movement. 
Specifically in relation to law this meant that a general movement 
towards an English rhetoric for the disciplines2 had to be accommo-
dated in the form of a reworking of the forensic or legal rhetorical 
tradition and specifically of its classification and arrangement -
properly invention and distribution - of the subject maller and 
arguments, or in Lever's terms storehouses, of law. Conceived in a 
critical vein by schohlrs such as Ascham, Cox, Elyot, Wilson, 
Puttenham and others, a properly English rhetoric had first to be 
constructed upon the ground of English usage, a usage free particu-
larly of the inappropriate use of dark, borrowed and elliptic terms 
rudely taken from other languages, free, as they themselves put it, 
from the ink pen 'and hotchpot terms that lived on in the disciplines

from their Latin and French past. In law in particular the problem 
was extreme by virtue of its multilingual and archaic forms, by virtue 
of its Saxon, Nordic, Norman, Latin and middle English vocabu-
laries. More than that, however, the suspicion existed that in law as in 
other disciplines, though perhaps less manifestly so, foreign termin-
ologies exclude methad and logic in favour of a purely stylistic usage, 
a rhetoric devoid of content and inappropriate in form, a rhetoric of 
pure though dark persuasion beautifully denounced by JohnJeweli in 
1548: 'Why fill the forum with cries, vociferations and tears? Why call 
down the Gods from Heaven? Why raise the shades from the 
underworld? Why have buildings, temples, columns, tombs, and 
stones cry out? What do they want of such faces? Why that thrashing 
about of the body?'1 Not all rhetoric looks the same in the light of 
reason, nor do the classical proponents of the discipline necessarily 
deserve to be transposed into English without criticism or amend-
ment. 
The stirring of critical life within the rhetorical tradition and the 
attempt ta introduce elements ofa scholastic logic into the Ciceronian 
tradition find an exemplary expression in the conversion of 
Fraunce's teacher, Gabriel Harvey. from a purely custodial praise of 
Cicero to a critical philology in the Ciceronianus. It was an enlighten-
ment depicted in strongly personal terms as an awakening, an 
improvement in the quality oflife, the advent indeed ofa purer love, a 
love of a discipline and not me~e ) y of a man, Cicero and his Latinity: 
'at any rate I virtually preferred to be elected to the company of 
Ciceronians rather than to the saints ... I vained words more than 
content, language more than thought, the art of speaking more than 
the thousand subjects of knowledge; I preferred the mere style of 
Marcus Tully to all the postulates of the philosophers and mathe-
maticians.'2 In the place of a blind Latinity or purely emulative 
classicism, Harvey moved towards two critical postulates. The first 
was common to the general Renaissance move towards re-reading the 
classics. The classical tradition and its sacred authors were to be re-
read so as to discover within the text its historicity, to find something 
more, 'something greater than Cicero in Cicero himselr. To look to

MEMORY, PRECEDENT AND WRITINC SYSTEMS OF LAW 
This injunction is primary to a practical philosophy or to a rhetoric of 
the real, a rhetoric which takes up Vieo's project of setting down the 
skills of citizenship, the' art of civil discourse as a human form oflife 
with all its passions, its friendships. its silences, its loyalties and its 
betrayals. These are precisely the terms of memory and the costs of 
living. 
I t is certainly true that Fraunee attacks specious rhetoric, and those 
legal 'orators, as referring all to persuasion and victory, omit orderly 
distribution; obscure things purposely; amplify; change; and turn all 
things upside down, placing the best arguments first and last: leaving 
the worst, in the middle of the speech altogether'. So too, we may note, 
he attacks the 'custom ... among grand little mootmen, who cast case 
upon case, as carters do billets, and for every collateral trifle, run over 
all the six hundred and thirty three titles of Brookes' abridgement'.l 
The reason for such criticism is twofold. From any perspective of a 
proper rhetoric such argument or discourse as described is imperti· 
nent, digressive, repugnant and sordid; it occupies the mind and the 
memory with irrelevances, it forms subjects of no value and a polity 
that is based upon confusion ifnot directly upon deceit and falsehood: 
'as in the universities as in the Inns of Court, the greedy desire of a 
superficial show in unnecessary trifles makes us want the true 
substance: they for haste to get a prebend by a degree, make light work 
and run over two or three epitomes; and we by a moate book and a 
Brookes abridgement climb to the bar and bar ourselves utterly of the 
substance of the common law'.2 Let it be here repeated, however, that 
it is not rhetoric that was attacked by Fraunce but rather a particular, 
uneducated and unscholarly use ofit. In a material sense it was a lack 
of ethics that was impugned; these forensic orators did not read the 
history of their discipline. Bracton and Bryttan were no longer in 
print. These lawyers, in other words, did not know where they were, 
they did not know what institutional time it was, they acted upon rotc 
and they relied upon an undigested knowledge culled from epitomes, 
upon an easy display of verbal sophistry and upon an inauthentic life, 
a decayed tradition, a dead word, a usurious politics. At the level of 
scholarship, Fraunce simply adverts to the absence of any method, to 
the lack of dialectic and the absence of any theory oflaw. 
In addition to the requirement that lawyers read, learn and

3 I 
embody their own tradition as a living tradition, as a living word, the 
memory and history that Fraunce so copiously annotates for their 
benefit in his examples from all of the 'authors' of the common law 
and from its named and anonymous reports, are the novel injunctions 
that rhetoric be rationalised as a part of civil life and that memory 
become a history, an order of the tradition understood in conceptual 
terms. For Fraunce, Ramist method was the instrument that could 
save the law from the lawyers and return it to the halls, the schoiae, of 
scholarship. That point speaks to the fact that law is the essential art 
of the polis, of politics, and cannot be abandoned to ignorance. It also 
draws it towards method as the art of arts and the science of sciences 
(scientia scitnliarum): 
[A]n art is a methodical disposition of true and coherent precepts, for the 
more easy perceiving and better remembering of the same: and this 
methodical or orderly disposition of divers precepts is taught in logic, as 
pertaining essentially thereunto. So that logic was deservedly called the 
Art of Arts, the instrument of instruments, the hand of philosophy. I 
Logic, however, is rhetorical in both substance and form. In terms of 
form, Fraunce's logic follows Ramus' and divides into invention and 
judgment with memory as the third division. In formal terms the logic 
thus follows the classical rhetorical schema with the simple exclusion 
of style as a fundamental category. In substantive terms logic reasons 
so as to dispute, to differentiate, to teach and to analyse: 'it is not tied 
to anyone thing, but apt for anything, free from all, yet fit for all, 
framing orderly, proving strongly, expounding plainly, persuading 
forcibly, any Art, any cause, any question, any man whatsoever'.2 It is 
rhetorical then in the sense that it bends, mOves and persuades to 
action, and Fraunce later specifies admirably: 
I will never think him worthy of the title and name of a logician, that 
never put his general contemplation of logical precepts in particular 
practice .. . what precepts soever the common rhetoricians put down for 
ordering of exordiums and framing and disposing of the whole cause of 
their speech fitly and according to cause, auditors, time, place, and such 
Jikej all those I say are altogether logical, not in any respect pertaining to 
rhetoric, but as a rhetor may be directed by logical precepts of 
judgement and disposition. 3

the genesis of Cicero's text, (0 read and re-read Terence, Virgil, 
Plautus, Caesar, Sallust, Livy and Pliny, would both expose the 
weaknesses, Ithe warts .. the ulcers, the scars of diction' I in the 
Ciceronian text, upon the body of the remembered man, and also lay 
to rest a philology which had become no more than imitation. The 
second invention proposed by Harvey was more radical in political or 
topical terms: the history of rhetoric did not merely outdatc Cicero, it 
postdated him as well, There was a history to his .reccption 
throughout Europe, the development and amendment ofhls t~xt~ by 
the IGermans, the French and British. 'I Contemporary conunental 
scholarship, in other words, was to be looked upon seriously, 
favourably, in the persons of Erasmus, Ramus, Longolius, Sturmius, 
Fregius and the Englishmen Smith and Cheke: 'these men we may not 
only compare but even prefer to any number of Italians ... After all, 
the true, genuine, most ancient mimesis is a tradition given us by the 
profound judgment of the Cisalpines.'2 It was to the contemporary 
scholarship of Ramus and Erasmus in particular that the disciphne of 
rhetoric should move: 'merely pointing out, as some have done, the 
ornaments of tropes and the embellishment of figures, without 
indicating the stores of arguments, the quantities of proofs, and the 
structural framework, seems to me tantamount to displaying 'a body 
that is surprisingly beautiful and lovely but deprived of sense and 
life' ,3 In the place of the study of weightless or winged figures, 
exposition should, for Harvey, turn lO the figures of logic, to the 
examination of the entbymeme, the rhetorical syllogism, and to 'all 
the epicheiremata that occupy the intellect'.4 
Consider then the possibility of a logic of law, a jurisprudence or 
scholarship, which applied Harvey's twO general tenets of method to

history and in relation to other legal traditions. It would, in short, 
draw law into the order of disciplines and, in more brutal terms, into 
scholarship. In terms of the common law it would attempt to save the 
law from its insularity and equally to spare jurisprudence the endless 
repetition or vacuous mimicking of an exclusively legal identity. It 
would be a critical discipline, a scholarship which moved between 
cHfferent disciplines and across tcmporalities, one which transgressed 
merely national boundaries and invoked a definition of law itselfas an 
embodiment of lire, as something lived and not merely suffered as the 
rules of an institution. The law, for Fraunce, is precisely to be 
understood as a way ofliving and, more profoundly, as the structure 
of a life; it is both memory and method in the sense of habit, 
regularity, rhythm or way of life, a mode or modus vivtndi. Method is 
the tensor; it is surface and extension as well being the more familiar 
order or, in prosaic terms, the systematic form of instruction or 
mtthodus in the particular sense developed by Ramus and his 
followers, The observation of the different meanings of method as law 
is essential in that - unrecognised and uncommented though it may 
bel - at the centre ofFraunce's logic oflaw lies the precept that law is 
already a discipline, a memory, a nascent method for every genera-
tion, It is - as are all disciplines - a subject matter that had been 
worked and reworked, ordered and re-ordered, read and re-read in its 
own peculiar and generally silent way. What that means is that 
Fraunce comes to law in full recognition of history; he endeavours to 
apply logic to that specific history and those particular texts rather 
than to use philosop~y to annul ~istory . E.ven more significantly, he 
comes to law as an eXistent rhetonc and not as mere fact: that law is a 
rhetoric means that it embodies a history of language and of 
citizenshipi it forms lives and repeats memories of bow to liye of how 
one has lived in the past, Far from wishing to abolish the rhetorical 
dimension oflaw, as argument and as discourse, as an institution that 
deals with life - that is, with things which Aristotle deemed probable 
rather than necessary2 - Fraunce is concerned with a much more 
visceral and ~mbitious project, that of bringing to the civil assembly 
'a more easy and elegant kind of disputatioll,joining rhetoric to. logic, 
and referring that precise straightness to philosophical exercises'.3

MEMORY, PRECEDENT AND WRITING SYSTEMS OF LAW 
membering of sites of both pleasure and pain, the habitual actions, so 
in terms of genre or institutions memory is in a specific place; it is 
attached to these walls, those gargoyles, that stairwell, those tables-
why else do they take the form that they do? The institution gathers its 
memory through its material body, its buildings, its furniture, its 
windows, its others texts. Memory is the inner discourse of the body-
the lesion that will not go, the trauma that even the most vigorous 
repression simply buries further within or ~xiles to the memory of the 
sleeping body, to dream. Memory is simultaneously the inner speech 
of the institution. It is the institution's soul in the sense that without 
memory there would be no body, no surface, no skin, neither pleasure 
nor pain. Without memory. there would be no speech, no institution, 
neither power nor lovel neither desire nor fear. Consider, indeed, law 
as an institution and specifically as a form of memory, as a history, 
and as a body of tradition or corpus iuris: that is, as precedent, as time 
immemorial or temporal usage. 
The rhetorical issue that underlies and structures the Lau.der's Logike 
is precisely that of the nature, the body and the building of an 
institutional memory: what are its places. what is its structure, what 
are the images by which we remember it as lawyers and it us as 
subjects? More specifically in relation to English law, how are we to 
comprehend a tradition that defines itself not simply as memory but 
further as memory 'out of mind' or beyond memory, as immemorial 
usage, as that which exceeds 'living memory' and so incorporates an 
habitual life, a material structure, a soul if you will that is not the 
prisoner of any living body? How are we to understand a soul- the 
spirit of law - that makes the body a prisoner of its own: that is. a 
prisoner or the images and institutions of material life, of a sedentary 
and repetitive cycle of being, of memories and maps that were 
England. the Royal Peace, inveterate practice in the eternal present of 
myth? Put another way, lived memory is linked more closely to the 
imagination than to history; it is unconscious, a pure substance, 
residuous to the techniques, the movements and the mechanics orthe 
body and of all that the body passes through. 
At its most profound level the Lawier's Logike can be equally well 
read as a rhetoric of law, as a theory or legal argumentation 
understood in a topical and figurative sense, as it can be understood 
as a logic in any stricter or more necessary and demonstrative sense. 
At the level of inaugural motive, Fraunce's concern is to institute a 
logic onegaJ memory, a legal ethics that will embody the patterns and

habits, the law of the uncounted lives and the innumerable genera-
tions of a polity, a commonwealth or social body. In a very simple 
sense. such a project is in rhetorical terms entirely appropriate; the 
path or the law is precisely memory and so the most relevant and 
practical science of law will be a theory of memory, of the specific 
memories of law, a thr:ory orthe mnemonic ground of precedent and 
of material life, of the significance of repetition as custom. The art of 
memory which Fraunce spells out in terms of a putative logic oflaw 
concentrates on two principal aspects of legal memory: firstly. 
language, which carries with it its own memory of meaning, its 
morphology as well as its etymologies or notations. the historical 
accumulation oflived usage that can be unearlhed in the substance or 
a language itself; secondly. reason, which is to be understood in tr:rms 
of perception or perspicuity, for 'those things we keep best in our 
minds which we know by sight and have worked with our eyes'. 1 
Underpinning both categories oflegal memory is the argument that 
through order an art may reduce the apparently diverse to recognis-
able schemata; the dismembered or torn Z body of OUf law may be 
remembered and reformed to the ex lent that its subject matter. which 
is particular and continuously changing, will allow. It is precisely the 
'appearance' of reason, the mode of presentation of argument 
according to the best available legal topics or invented places or 
argument, that guarantees such memorisation as is possible in law: 
[P}n'ma regula r:xcluclr:s all false and lame precepts, which if it were 
obsr:rved in our law, then all repugnant dreams of sergeants and 
counsellors that serve the time and speak ror monr:y should not run so 
current for law: nay every judgment given either without reason, or with 
partiality, should not stand for justice: evr:ry semble, should not pass for 
a sentence, nor every dictum fuit for a dictator's constitution.3 
If we turn briefly to the substantive details of the lAwiu's Logike, 
memory governs law not as a series of established particularities, 
precedents that will always differ from circumstance to infinite 
circumstance, but as 'essential law' , as a method of handling , defining 
and dividing a system of argument and of sentential (proving) figures. 
Memory establishes legal institutions and not the banal specificity of 
individual cases: ISO that a man shall by one chapter of[Bracton or]

MEMORY, PRECEDENT AND WRITING SYSTEMS OF LAW 
While logic may constitute a higher order of classification and 
arrangement of a discipline than does the rhetorical art, it is not 
essentially distinct from rhetoric and it is Frauncc's originahty to 
maintain consistently that logic and rhetoric should be joined as 
disciplines: 'one logic suffices to dispute all things, necessary or 
contingent or whatsoever ... all logic is general, and applicable as 
well to things imagined, as things that be extant in truth: and 
therefore to words also, as words have causes, effects, subjects, 
adjuncts and other arguments to be considered'.' The same science of 
logic applies, in other words, to matters that are certain and to 
matters of opinion, to the necessary and to the probable, the 
speculative and the practical, the convincing and the persuasive: the 
law ofreason is a formal law which allows the argument, of syllogistic 
reason, that 'the conclusion itself does follow necessarily, by force of 
the form ofthe syllogism; but yet, of itself, it is but a contingent axiom, 
although the deduction ofit from premises, be, as I said, necessary, by 
reason of the lawful framing of the syllogism'.:.! Though the subject 
matter of common law is vast, its reports and its spoken remains 
distantly scattered I its practices frequently opaque, its languages 
rude and borrowed) although it is in its content contingent and 
frequently strange, it can none the less, for Fraunce, be joined to logic 
and its rhetorical organisation and presentation can similarly be 
made methodical and straight by recourse to the reasoning of 
probabilities. 
Memory and the Fascination of Law 
Rhetoric gives logic a body; logic gives rhetoric a soul. It gives 
rhetoric a memory that will last, a structure of discourse that exceeds 
the immediacy oflanguage, that somehow binds the figures, the faces, 
the masks of its enunciation to a history and to an institution. In 
organising legal discourse according to the principles of dialectic, of a 
Ramistic logic which proceeds from the invention of arguments to 
their disposition in discourse, Fraunce joins logic to rhetoric in a 
further way. Before we look at the substance of the logic, it is 
interesting to consider that the motive for introducing method to law 
is the generic one of presenting a discourse so as to make it amenable

33 
to memory: the limbs and branches, the particularities and fragments 
of the common law, are schematised so as to be remembered; they are 
cut up and put back together (re-membered), for 'method is the 
chiefest help of memory ) (and] instructions for memory, ifthey belong 
to any art, must needs be logical'. I It is the logic of disposition - that 
is, the orderly and rational arrangement of a subject matter, of its 
places or loci - Ihat will classically allow easy recall of arguments) 
though significantly Fraunce also adds advice on diet and exercise as 
mnemonic alds. The irony of the play involved in such a statement is 
again thaI it·mixes genres, for memory, the art of memoria invented by 
Simonides, is a rhetorical art which works through the body and 
through images. Thomas Wilson, to take an example from a 
contemporary of Fraunce's, adopts the classical fourth division of 
rhetoric, memory, as the conclusion to his curricula manual, Tnt Artt 
ofRhetorique, published in J553. Memory is essential to any oral art; it 
thus has a central place in rhetoric for 'the same is memory to the 
mind, that life is to the body'.:t It is interesting then that memory is 
inscribed in the body, that it requires that one 'keep a diet, eschew 
surfeits, sleep moderately, accompany with women rarely, and last of 
all ... exercise the wit with cunning of memory things without 
Book'.3 The order of the sentence indicates that it is the body, the 
organic memory, that is first or structural; its instances or manifesta-
tions in wit or reason or cunning are secondary, accessory. Ifwe think 
of how memory is to be inscribed in wit also, it requires learning to 
have places (rooms) and to digest images in them accordingly 'and 
even as in wax we make a print with a seal, so we have places where 
lively pictures must be set' - such are the places of memory, an 
architecture of images that the rhetoT will inhabit during the course of 
speech. The architecture of such imagery, the symbolic rooms of 
memory as sign, can be understood quite literally. For Cicero, to take 
on.e further example, the rhetor should memorise by placing his 
thoughts in connection with the forum, the building, in which he 
speaks. Those gargoyles, that balcony and the furniture of thr. 
auditorium in which he speaks are the physical host to memories both 
past and present, both necessary and accidental. Just as individual 
memory comes through the body, just as it is an embodiment, a re-

types of cause are then set out in terms of aids to specification of the 
character and content of the narrative: the thing caused must be 
analysed, the general separated from the special, the thing itself 
divided into subject and object, the adjuncts of the subject traced. 
The general schema is commonplace to its epoch and is easily 
understood, To take some examples: the subject is exercised through 
its adjuncts, called its object or subject matter as in 'colours be the 
object of seeing'; or, in terms of the requisite adjuncts to 'presentment' 
beforeJustices of (he Peace, as set out in Lambard, it is requisite to set 
out '(i) the name, surname and additions of the party indicted, (ii) the 
year, day and place in which the offence was done, , . (iv) the manner 
of the fact, and the nature of the offence as the manner of the treason, 
felony or trespass',l Once subject, object and further adjuncts 
pertaining to them have been specified it is necessary to distribute or 
divide the parts of the argument and to bring them to agreement or to 
opposition. The best division is from cause and effect, to which 
Fraunce adds that 'this is a lamentable want in our law, I mean exact 
division, in place whereof we have nothing else, but either ABC 
method without coherence or primo notandum, two not three l not 
four, not five and so on until he come to decimotertio notandum, like 
dunces in schools and silly babblers in pulpits: that a man were far 
better to make a new speech than remember this waste and confused 
schediasmata'.2 The memory of law, in other words, would sink 
without trace I were it not for the strategy oflogical connection which 
divides and arranges according to a relation of cause to effect, of 
subject to object, of general to particular and of definition to thing 
defined. Along the path of that relation the logician will distribute 
adjuncts. To take a further example, this time from Stamford on the 
royal prerogative, the structure of the sentence can be set out in terms 
of cause and effect, and the relation of (syntactic) progression 
between them is such that the subject is exercised in the powers of the 
prerogative and these powers have attached to them certain memor· 
able adjuncts: 
for which cause the laws do attribute to him {the king] all honour, 
dignity, prerogative and preeminence, which prerogative dmh not only 
place of invention is the rountain or all sciences: for that matter is known perfectly 
whose cause is understood.'

extend to his own person, but also to all other his possessions, goods and 
cattels, As, that his person shall be subject to no man's suit, his 
possessions cannot be taken from him by violence or wrongful decision: 
his goods and his cauels are under no tribute, toll or custom, nor 
otherwise distrainable. l 
The king rules alone, through a body which is untouchable, inhuman, 
not his own, a supreme harijan. 
The first book of the logic ends with a discussion of places and 
degree and an exemplification by Fraunce of the way in which any 
concept can be dragged through all of the topics of invention and 
distribution and an argument compiled which will prove as much as 
the subject matter will allow. If we push our reading further, the 
authority and appeal of the logic resides not simply in the manner in 
which it aids memory through a reasoned narrative but rather in the 
relationship it posits between presence and memory, between logos 
and logic. The logic draws argument through the rooms, the places, 
the corridors, if you will, of memory schematised and imaged so as to 
be as perspicuous and as straight as possible. The connective 
principle, already adverted to, is not, however, simply one of visual 
recollection or remembering. It is more than that; it relies upon a first 
cause, an origin whose presence is to be traced throughout the 
argument, I t is not only that a legal cause is specific, that it is of a time 
and place and person, of actions, but also that the construction of 
legal narrative is dependent upon a transmitted history of prior 
speech, of the speech of law frozen in the textual history of written 
usage. The logic establishes the path oflegal narrative; it sets up a 
sorting house, a mail room in which the legal records of past presence 
can be pigeon·holed as the memory of the common law. These 
litigants, that body, these properties or words, had fallen to law and 
here is their monument; this is where Ihey fell; this, as history, was 
their destiny, their afterlife in law. A logic that classifies and orders a 
history is not, however, the sum of Fraunce's teaching, The process 
whereby a logic oflaw sends on the history of causes, of the originals of 
the law or at least the legal past, is not the entire narrative, In its 
rhetorical dimension it requires not simply remembrance but a return to 
speech, a movement from logos to logos, frorr. presence to presence: via the 
avenue of logic, narrative is bestowed a second, rhetorical presence, 
F raunce makes an extraordinary point when he distinguishes the

Brytton more plainly perceive the nature of Garde, Villen and etcetera 
than by turning and tossing of forty incoherent cases in year books, 
which do not expound the nature of Garde, Villen, and etcetera, and 
do presuppose a general notice of them',! We remember, in short, 
through a perception of rational connection, through a conceptual 
recognition of general relationships, and not through the particular

recollection a relevant pattern or habit or argument: the particular 
case can provide no 'true definition or explication of the nature and 
essence of any thing in our law, these singlesowld lawyers and golden 
asses' who resort to such strategies of precedent give no 'special light' 
to the issues in hand but rather confuse memory and darkt-.n 
reason.2 The particular case is indeed prone to destroy memory 
through digression: 'a man takes upon himself to read from the stalute 
of Fines, and he thrummeth in fifty scaltered and undigested cases of 
estate tail in possession, and as many of the same in reversion, with a 
cluster of sophistical and incoherent points .. , and makes a well 
meaning statute the cloak of two hundred ambiguitic:s'.3 In a more 
radical definition drawn from Plowden, if the argument appears 
reasonable then it ap~ars as law ."' The structure oflaw must thus be 
conceived in terms of reason, but it is a rhetorical and mnemonic 
reason and it is as such, as reasoning that covers ends as diverse as 
tcaching, analysis, disputation and differentation. that the Lawitr's 
ugikt systematises common law. 
The law institutes life as memory through its language and its texIS. 
The legal institution is in its most general sense precisely an 
inscription of the past in the present; it creates legal personality and 
subjectivity as a reflection of textual time and of a written imagina~ 
tion, In a very specific sense it establishes a moveable mask, a fictional 
reason or nomadic body, a body which moves, that is bound and so 
acts according to the narrative of1aw, To develop an adequate theory 
orlegal memory is to develop an account of the narrative, the history, 
through which the law institutes a past -
both immediate and 
immemorial- as text and as progression, Memory is narrational and

cartography of that elastic temporal expanse between the beginning 
and end of a story, between the exergue and the conclusion, between 
the exordium and the peroration. The literary scholarship which 
Fraunce brought from the university is in many senses an ideal 
discipline for providing the tools which will map the narrative 
memories of law according to a logic of textual action, a logic of 
placement which will allow the student oflaw, the notary, advocate or 
judge to inscribe a particular circumstance, a case or cause, in the 
relevant legal narrative and according to the appropriate forms. The 
first division oflegallogic is that of invention. 1 t studies and explicates 
'the various divers kinds, characters, affections, relations, and 
properties of several arguments'. I Narrative, in other words, begins 
with a proposition as to time and plact and at the level of legal 
argument that means that a general head of argument, a category or 
'categorcme' - a canon, maxim or rule of consequence - is to be 
selected as appropriate to the genre or institutional circumstance; it 
forms the topic, the place or scat or spring of the subsequent narrative 
action in which the law will institute social being in the mask ofIegal 
personality. 
The principle of narrative memory as it relates to law is one 
predicated upon a conception of causes, both logical and lc:gal. In 
terms of the Ramistic logic which Fraunce follows, at least in a 
schematic sense, the order of causes is theistic: there is no history 
without a cause, there is no narrative without origin and that origin is 
in its most. exemplary form lhe unitary and unifying person of the 
divinity: 'God is the first and principal cause of all things. All other 
causes whatsoever are secondary and subject to his eternal direc. 
tion.':'! We remember, in other words, by tracing a structure of 
narrative actions which moves a first principle orprincipium, sovereign 
or author or God as the case may be, to its consequent or conclusion. 
Using a variety of examples from the common law, Fraunce proceeds 
to elaborate the variety of possible causes according to their degree of 
primacy, the causes of logical narrative being efficient, material, 
formal and final.3 The properties of logical narration according to

cerebral and subjectifying formalism, the empty monotony, of a 
morality of rules. 
The desire for an ethics can be reformulated in terms of tradition 
and transmission. Consider that the law begins as an ethics I as an oral 
way of life, a custody that is spoken through a lived memory, one 
which makes the body walk upon a particular path. What is 
important in the concept of an oral tradition is also, however, the fact 
that an unwritten memory is an unconscious or residual form of life: 
its writing is organic; it is to be understood both as a fate pronounced 
as the judgment of the wise and also as an inner speech. In Nietzsche's 
terms the first writing was an inscription upon the body. I The second 
writing was inscription upon other bodies, upon the text, the vellum 
made from the skin of deer or the wethers made from sheep. The 
material form that carries tradition as text - the lextus is after all a 
weaving, a wool, ~omething that would go well with wethers - is not 
insignificant. The text carries a messagel an address, a life that grows 
cyclically, a life that is reproduced in specific forms: something which 
we hope for although we cannot know with any certainty that it will 
return as the same. All that we have to hold on to a culture with, or to 
reproduce or change it. are the uncertain marks, the: material lines, of 
a remembered past now uncertainly present in its future. Alterna-
civc:iy, we are left with no more (and no less) than language as the 
vehicle of the past in the present. Where legal memory is genuinely a 
question of time out of mind or of time immemorial, it is language 
which is exemplary of the unwritten inscription of things and thereby 
stands for or symbolises the origin of things: 'notation or etymology is

ephemeral undemanding . . . upon this incarnate forgetfulness, that it will be 
permanently present? As one may imagine, this primeval problem was not solved

the interpretation of a word. For words be notes of things, and of all 
words either derivative or compound, you may yield some reason 
made [fet] from the first arguments l if the notation be well made. It is 
called Originatio, quod originem verborum explicet; et erymologia, id esl, 
veriloquium.
l ! Where the reason is unknown or the word is obscure 
then, for Fraunce, the subsequent argument is dangerous. To 
understand the words of a profession such as law is to understand that 
which they note, a history I a tradition, the passage of time and oflives. 
They form the frame through which a body is perceived, they mark, 
they map, they constitute both the polity and the polity of the soul. If 
being human is to be a 'speaking being', the forgotten frame of that 
speech is the discourse oflaw. [n the strongest of terms, at the level of 
structure, language has its own logic, language frames speech and 
manipulates discourse; it speaks the Law in advance of the lawyer for, 
as Fraunce notes I iwords also, as words l have causes l effects, subjects, 
adjuncts and other arguments to be considered
l
• It is interesting to 
think that words have causes and adjuncts, subjects and effects, that 
language has memories but also its own system, its own logic: we usc 
it as lawyers for the purpose of exchange but what if we were 
exchanged by language, by legal language, by a system of texts that as 
individuals we had no power to change. 
Of Law and Forgetting 
As the author of the Lawier's Logike, Fraunce, like his text, was 
forgotten. He had 'moved the patience' of the lawyers, those whom he 
'most desired to be patient', and they responded as he feared: 
grudgingly I recalcitrandy, they refused to be better scholars l resisted 
the claims of the Logike and ignored the system that it presented. If we 
read Fraunce now, it is as a transplant, as a thing forgotten by law, 
as the work of an outsider who remained an outsider for four 
centuries l perhaps for longer. [f we return to our starting point, 
h,?wever, we may suspect that even here the oppositions between 
inside and outside, between success and failure, us and them, are less 
hermetic than is often apparent.2 We argued that there are always

argument from the presence of reason: 
'arguments borrowed' are properly called witness or testimony and 
are 'fit only for proof or confirmation'. They take the form of famous 
sayings, aphorisms, proverbs or natural or written laws, but 'those 
who use the authority or others instead of argument of their own - are 
fools ... in these borrowed arguments there is no reason or 
persuasion, but rather violence and compulsion ... consider not who 
speaks but how true that which is spoken'.1 Interesting that a lawyer, 
or commentator on law, should have the wit to doubt the rational 
value of common law precedent or what Blackstone called 'establish-
ment' in and of itself. A system of mere rules, something that is no 
more than a morality, is oflittle instrumentality: the letter killeth bu~ 
the spirit, the rhetor, gives life, through speech, through the presence 
of narrative, through thc presence of reason as law and not through 
the mere invocation of an extinct prose or dry textual dust. 
Logic relays the tradition in a particular form; it sends it on and in 
doing so is forced, in so far as the tradition remains alive, to address it 
to an audience, to invent recipients, either subjects or those that Karl 
Kraus termed hallucinations with names and addresses. The specific 
form oflegal presence will be the subject matter of the next chapter; it 
is predicated upon a narrational constitution, a standing together in 
the same story. For the moment let us simply report Fraunce's use of 
the second part oflogic, judgment or disposition of arguments, as the 
method of the habitual or formal presence oflaw: 
[Dlisposition in logic docs artificially place, settle, and dispose single 
arguments one with another, and that first axiomatically, in several 
axioms: then, proceeding to a syllogism and method, as occasion shall 
serve. This second part of logic is also called judgment, of the use, 
commodity and end thereof. For that, by a certain direction, rule and 
prescription of disposition, arisesjudgment of the truth or untruth of any 
axiom; the consequence or inconsequence of any syllogism; and the 
perspicuity or confused obscurity of any method. of proceeding.'2 
Disposition, in short, coheres the text by ordering the sequence of 
argument both at the level of the sentence (gnomt) and at that of units 
of discourse above the level of the sentence (dianoetical), In each case 
the subjects of such ordering arc axioms, quite literally the bonds of 
the law (axioma) from the Greek, signifying worth of, fit for, dignity or

authority: 'the logicians it would seem, took it for any thing spoken, 
pronounced, told, as it were, with authority'. 1 The discourse of logic, 
its use as the vehicle of tradition , is predicated upon a rhetorical desire 
to order or methodise discourse, to make it appear authoritative, to 
lend it the stature of teaching or the gravity oflaw. However such a 
method is formulated, it is worth observing that law as discourse has 
no unique claim to authority: 'historiographers, poets, orators and 
such other speakers and writers, are not bound so strictly to observe 
this perfection of the first method: but may, according to their matter, 
meaning, purpose, time, place, persons wisely observe the best of 
their intent' ,2 Observe also that the authority of legal discourse is a 
limited and contingent one: tht syllogism as a way of formulating 
arguments may achieve a certain necessity but it is internal to its 
statement, to the specific linguistic association or 'bond' being made; 
its subject matter was not in any necessary or consistent sense 
conceived as being of a demonstrable or non·contingent status. Legal 
logic simply orders a subject matter of (memorable) axioms of 
varying dcgrees of generality and certain only to the extent that they 
remain tied to the contingency of a past, to a place and circumstance: 
certainty appertains to 'things past and present'; uncertainty to 
'things to come'.3 All precepts of an art should seek to start from a rule 
of truth; this ought to be 'necessarily and always true without 
exception . , . but besides this, they must also be rules of justice, as it 
wt.re, and also of wisdom, or discretion, orcompcndious brevity' .4 We 
are left to conclude, in other words, that the form of a discourse 
carried with it the symptoms of its content and it is therefore because 
legal discourse is future orientated, because the criminal injunction is 
directed at behaviour yet to come, because the contract determines 
the potential significance offuture events, because a will or a trust or a 
covenant passes property on 10 generations to come, 10 those born and 
those not yet born, that it will never allow of any greatcr certainty or 
necessity than the teaching of method or the resources of memory can 
provide. In philosophical terms, the !ogic of law should strive to 
achieve the status of an ethics, of an habitual and embodied 
behaviour, a memory inscribed upon the flesh, and not the purely

disciplines or as between authors and traditions. It escapes the 
lifeworld and equally evades placement within any concept of 
knowledge. Thus, to follow the example used earlier, Gabriel 
Harvey's attempt to rework the discipline of rhetoric is based 
pr~cisdy upon a desire to re-appropriate and rethink a formulaic 
tradition. He endeavours to compare Cicero to other authors so as 'to 
gauge his excellence'. l Harvey's purpose was to come to terms with 
the fact that Cicero, however venerable, was not without fault. How 
was one to understand what it meant to be a Ciceronian if not by 
comparing Cicero to other authors and other lives? Thus he 
comments crucially: 'I began forthwith to understand how dangerous 
it is for one enslaved to prejudiced opinions to take shelter in the 
authority of this or that group of men; it is tantamount to entering a 
slave-dungeon - I saw that 1 must reCUrn to the old masters'.1 The 
error of the I lalians and of their modern followers was essentially that 
of developing a method based elllirely upon imitation and so free of 
the possibility of detecting blemishes or faults in the classic texts and 
free also of any aspiration to develop or translate Cicero across the 
boundaries of historical eras. Cicero was to be 'presenced' by the 
techniques of dogma; it was not any part of that method to question or 
debate Cicero in relation to contemporary know ledges. 
For Fraunce, a critical science of law could also begin by 
questioning the internal history of the discipline and so by challeng-
ing the dogmatic quality oflegal method: 'they prate of method who 
never knew order'.3 Indeed it was not simply that lawyers knew 
nothing of philosophic method; their discipline was actively hostile to 
the comparative and interdisciplinary questions that philosophic 
method brought with it: 'you would love the law but sine n'vali 
(without rivals J; you would reign, but alone, hinc illat lachrymae (hence 
those tears],. 4 It was for precisely this reason that Fraunce turned, at 
the level of philosophic method, [Q a critical fe-reading of Aristotle 
and to the development of a modern order for the discipline of law 
based upon a reworked conception of dialectic. He wished to break 
down the insular internal history of the common law and its worship 
of Littleton in favour of a science that could be written into an 
hislOrically conceived episteme or order of knowledge. He wished to

break down the formulae of a system of esoteric and 'hotchpot' writs 
and uncounted concepts in favour of a science of disputation and 
judgment with a basis in a philosophic order rather than in a purely 
contingent accumulation of details and particularities. lfthe history 
ortegal practice were to be rea.d philosophically, it could be seen not 
as the arbitrary piling up of coincidences but as the development of 
categories of argument relating to concepts of property, tenure, 
servitude, obligation and the like which were the product of an 
existent lifeworld, the residues of practices, the efHuvia of everyday 
life. At the level of legal knowledge, Fraunce also intended to break 
down the insularity of the common law by reference to and 
comparison with other systems oflegal classification and practice. It 
was to the historical school of legal method developed on the 
continent and to the writings of the civilians that he turned to clarify 
both the history of European law and the narrative of its geographical 
passage, its translation and transplantation, across the boundaries of 
the European states. To understand the failure of those two 
ambitions, to understand how they were excluded from the science 
that was subsequently developed, is to understand one part of the 
positive unconscious of common law method, the fear of materiality, 
the horror of an historically conceived lifeworld, upon which a 
dogmatic science is founded. In material terms Fraunce also indicates 
certain elements of motive underlying those fears. The law, conceived 
as a market for legal services, would always be most effective and most 
highly valued if, even in the face of the printing presses and the 
vernacularisation ofrhe sciences, it could maintain the mentality and 
closure of an esoteric guild whose mysteries were to remain hidden in 
a foreign language, whose concepts were to continue to be insular and 
defined in artistic terms and whose method was to remain inacessible 
to the order of reason. Ir was in such a m~nner that lawyers could 
maintain the high value oflegal knowledge and the financial gentility 
of the profession. While the desire to continue the market viability of 
the profession is understandable, it was no part of the scholarship of 
law to affirm timidly the principles of obscurity upon which that 
market had hitherto been based. To sell and to understand were for 
Fraunce two different spheres of exchange even if both were subject to 
considerations of value. A theory of law such as Fraunce proposed 
had its value- ifit had any- in the order of know ledges and not in that 
of commodities; its gold was to be the dust of reason and nOt the 
immediate coinage: of the realm.

elements of the outside within, that there is a little pain in our 
pleasure, that there arc traces offailure in every success, while the text 
itself - even, or especially, when unread - carries with it the lives and 
practices that surrounded it, that formed ilS culture. A text is nevcr 
simply a thing; its materiahty is embedded, and whether it was read 
or remained unread matters little in terms of its esscntiallextuality, 
its existence as discourse within a formation of discourse or the 
inception of a science. That a text is forgotten does not and cannot 
mean that it thereby loses its history; its history is precisely contained 
in the modes of its disappearance. No texl, let us repeat, vanishes 
objectively, without residue, without trace. Let us say that a 
disappearance has its own aesthetics; it is never final. In that sense the 
desire to re-read Fraunce's Logike is coincident with the desire to 
understand legal science from a different frame, from a perspective 
that has been tilted by non-reception, by the strategies of forgetting 
that accompany any tradition! that create its underside! its positive 
unconscious: 'that level of knowledge that eludes the scientist and yet 
is part of scientific discourse'. 
It remains to trace that positive unconscious, that negative 
structure oflegal science, and to specify in this particular instance, in 
relation to this one text! what it might mean both then and now, in 
terms of criticism and law, in terms of the institution and of the lives 
that it institutes. We will trace, in other words, the trajectory of 
success to read the failures left in its wake; we will trace success 
precisely in terms of, and from the perspective of, its failures, a 
tradition understood in terms not ofits monuments but ofits ruins. In 
that Fraunce already provides a reading of his own text in terms of its 
probable failure, its non-reception, our task is made easier: it is at 
precisely these points that Fraunce saw his contribution as most 
positive, that it was always likely to fail to gain recognition. These 
were its poiDts of crisis; these were the arguments that would 
disappear and that continue to disappear before our eyes. They will 
be grouped here around three issues or sets of questions. Firstly, at the 
level oflegal culture, how was a relationship to be instituted between 
the guild mentality of the profession - and the esoteric mysteries that 
constituted its peculiar knowledge - and the other disciplines and 
institutions of a rapidly changing polity, a sociality whose techno-
what we ha v~ l iv~d, exp~rienced, tak~n into ourselves, no mor~ ~nl~rs into 
consciousn~ss .

45 
logical base was changing dramatically? Secondly, in a more 
particular sense, if law was a scholarly disdpline, or at least as a 
learned language and as an inherited system of classically dogmatic 
procedures was to be systematised again in the light of the Renais-
sance rediscovery ofthc classics, from where was this rewriting to take 
place? The philosophy that Fraunce appropriated and worked with 
was 'modern', but it was also continental. How would these 
characteristics relate to an insular tradition and an essentially 
conservative method? Finally, the Lawier's Logih presented a positive 
reclassification of the common law in terms, as we have seen, ofa logic 
of memory: it was concerned to present a theory of legal memory 
based upon the transmission of historical residues, the memory of 
what was lived and of the language that recorded those lives. It was in 
that sense concerned with a secular or essentially profane reading of 
law in the face of a tradition that was far from secular and which 
responded to criticism by ever more arbitrarily and vehemently 
reasserting its own version ofa mythic 'larrative or imagined history 
in which law was a sacrosanct 'presence'. a presence to becaUed down 
from its immemorial territory outside of the materiality of any merely 
lived memory, and beyond the reach of any secular logic or 
temporally based narrative of institutional languages and institu-
tional acts. 
If we are to understand the failed science for which Fraunce stood, 
if we are to understand the disappearance of his text and to map the 
place where he fell, it is as well to begin with an account of the concept 
of criticism for which he and the 'moderns' or Ramists stood. At a 
general level the notion of a critical reformation of the vernacular 
disciplines was a simple one. The disciplines were dogmatic in the 
literal sense of being 'unthinking' or merely learned. In that sense a 
discipline such as rhetoric or logic, theology or poetry, consisted of 
little more than a list of learned truths or axioms borrowed from a 
classical text. I As a discipline it thus had noorderor method of its own 
but was based rather upon a singular principle of emulation or 
imitation; it was to be learned by rate, memorised and passed on. The 
only history to which a discipline could thus aspire was an internal 
ant, a narcissistic history of its. own development: an eternal present 
of its own peculiar or specific but iso~ated truths. An internal history 
also, of course, precludes the possibility of comparison, as between

more discretion'. 1 The tradition. in other words, precisely as 
tradition, is perfect; it has to be understood, it exists to be understood 
and there is no place for crit!cism in that custodial task of exposition of 
a law too rich and too deep to be fully comprehended in anyone body 
in anyone lifetime. The law is always greater, in other words, than its 
servants, its practitioners: any apparent faults or contradictions are 
the errors of men and not of the law, for in hominis vitium non 
professionis.2 
The latter statement brings us to our final considerations of 
Fraunce's failure, of the terms and conditions that instituted a failure 
quite literally too profound for words, too profound at least to merit 
refutation. Where did he fall ifhe fell outside the law while living with 
it? Where did he fall if he fell beyond the boundaries of lhis new 
science of an age-old and hallowed tradition? Where did he fall iflegal 
history signally failed to record his demise, if he went unread and 
unremembered? What place was this in the geography of the 
discipline, a site of non-memory specifically circumscribed for a 
theory of legal memory? What species of science was it that 
established itself upon so complete and successful a repression: one 
which in Heidegger's terms had forgotten that it had forgotten this 
figure, this text. this memory, this man? Let us put it slightly 
differently: if legal science established itself upon the negative basis of 
a refusal of philosophy and modernitYl ifit refused comparison with 
other continental thought and with continental law, then it was left 
with no stronger theoretical basis for its method than memory alone, a 
memory cut off from reason and lost to contemporaneity. Such a 
practice of memory refused even to contemplate the possibility of a 
theory of memory not because it lacked a past but because its 
memories were not the memories of man, of the lifeworld or of lived 
history and language, but rather they were those ofa sacred presence 
or of an eternal and mythic continuity of the spirit, the breath and 
voice ofdivinc reason and natural law. It was traditio, which is to say 
authoritative clcricist tradition, sclerotic sacral wisdom, that was 
recollected in the most excellent and antique of all laws. Its memories 
were, for Coke, simply and directly the recollection of velustatis et 
veritalis vestigia,3 the memories of an age~old truth which was only 
comprehensible as being the same for all people at all times and in all

places, legal gold with a value that can only increase, a perfection that 
cannot know the blemishes or the blandishments of time. The 
procedures or methods of access to a truth which is conceived as 
external to the lifeworld and so to the contingency of human relations 
arc the precise antithesis of the procedures of any critical reason or 
comparative history. Memory in the hands of the legal tradition is not 
an historical method but rather a technique of faith: through the 
recollection of previous instances onegal presence, through establish-
ment or precedent. the law continuously rediscovers itself; it is made 
present to itself as logos or the word incarnate. Memory within such a 
rigorously internal history of a discipline is simply the witness of 
presence, the testimony of authority) the repetition of externally given 
truths. In the next chapter we will examine the specific methods and 
forms of presence that this truth took in the hands of the science of 
law; we will trace the relationship between memory and logos within 
the tradition that was actually established. our tradition) in which 
memory is always accompanied by forgetfulness, the logvs by its 
shadows. 
In conclusion we should note the crucial consequence ofFraunces's 
failure not simply in terms of the struggle for power within an 
educational institution but much more profoundly in terms of the 
character of the English legal tradition. What feU with Fraunce was 
not only the possibility of a scholarly tradition within the common law 
but also the possibility ofa system of commentary or jurisprudence in 
the continental sense ofa conversation with the past, a rewriting of the 
law in each act of judgment. Any tradition is based upon memory and 
upon repetition as the means whereby interpretation in a strong sense 
is possible. Repetition is never simply repetition. It informs the past, 
it adds to it, it brings it into the present through conversation, through 
the oral modes of the lifeworld. Interpretation is the essential 
scholarly activity for it is commentary that makes texts live, that 
differentiates the present from the past and recuperates that which 
must have been lived for a discourse to take the form that it docs. The 
common law tradition excluded Fraunce's account of the logic of 
memory; it also thereby excluded 'university men' or scholars as 
active participants in the institution. It was to remain to the present 
an internally defined and se lf~perpetuating professional body in 
which {he guild setting of the Inns of Court a:ld of the Colleges of Law 
were to be the educational and professional establishments, the 
institutions of a profession in which the scholar or the university had

MEMORY, PRECEDENT AND WRITING SYSTEMS OF LAW 
Supper at Emmaus 
At Emmaus the resurrected Christ was recognised not by face or 
image, nor by speech or body, but in the simple act of eating, It was, 
according to Luke (24: 3~IL when the apostles saw Christ breaking 
bread in the evening at Emmaus that they recognised him as the Son 
of man: 'their eyes were opened and they knew him; and he vanished 
out of their sight', The breaking of bread was the sign of divine 
presence pre-ordained at the last'supper. Emmaus was proof, if you 
will, of what Christ had said at the last supper prior to his betrayal 
and sacrifice. Emmaus signified that what dies can live on, that what 
passes can be remembered, that what is present is always potentially 
a reference to some other order of being or to some other text. For the 
sake of simplicity we will examine the last supper itself as the referent 
~fthe bread broken or the body betrayed at Emmaus. We will analyse 
the order of reference established at the last supper while always '\ 
bearing in mind that at Emmaus Christ's Eucharistic presence was 
acted out again. 
This was no ordinary supper. The Lord ate bread and drank wine 
for the last time. Here flesh and blood became spirit through an act of 
Communion. Here man received the first sign of the law through an 
act of sacrifice. 'That the LordJesus the same night in which he was 
betrayed took bread: and when he had given thanks, he brake it, and 
said, Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in 
remembrance of me . . . for as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this 
cup, ye do shew the Lord's death till he come' (r Corinthians 12), The 
j:ucharist, the repetition of the Last Supper at every Mass in every 
church, is the exemplary sign of the Christian faith; it is the 
sacrament, the appearance of grace, the continuing presence of 
Christ. It is also the original ritual of authority, the source of power of 
the Church, in that it is for Catholicism only through the consecration 
of the bread and wine that they can become substance: that is, the 
Resh and blood of the Lord. 
The significance of the Eucharist to the Church needs little 
reiteration, It was over the Eucharist that the Church went to war 
with itself in the Reformation and the Counter-Reformation, a 
dispute triggered by divergences of imerpretation of the nature of

the signs of the Lord's presence. What were its proper forms of 
representation, of re-presencing? The theological debates, however, 
also have a real political and legal significance, one which is less well 
known and in need of recuperation. 
At one level, the theory of the Eucharist is a theory of signification 
as such,1 It is a theory of the sign and of how the sign relates to 
presence, to an existent or 'experiential' thing, to an object, the body 
of Christ. It is also a theory of interpretation: behind these words,

relation between the theory of meaning, of divine truth, that the 
Eucharist represents and the development of the common law 
tradition, a tradition also based upon a theory of signs of truth, oflaw, 
and the modes of their interpretation. We may note first that the law 
comes from God and that the nature of God and of Cod's presence in 
the flesh is always going to be an essential question oflaw. Not only is 
God the source (cawa causaru) of law, but God is also the arbiter of 
truth, of meaning and of judgment; it is he who is the judge on the day 
ofthe Last Judgment. T!le conceptual apparatus of the Church, the

MEMORY, PRECEDENT AND WRITING SYSTEMS OF LAW 
The second aspect ofFrauncc's failure was of an equally contempo-
rary relevance. To democratise or simply to open up the discipline of 
law entailed a move away from little England, its insular tradition, its 
myth of separateness. It required also that the continental basis ~f 
that tradition in the Hellenic and Latin classics, the history of theIr 
transplantation and translation, be recognised and rethought. that 
the faces of English scholarship tum again to those particular sources 
of their inspiration. Even if one were to understand law in purely 
market terms, the market was placed on a route betwecn London and 
the continent, historically between Bologna, Montpellier, Paris and 
London - and what merchant would ignore his supplicrs? Consider 
the two key features of Fraunce's attack on the insularity of English 
legal knowledge. It required that the newly formed science come to 
terms both with modernity - the age of the Renaissance - and with the 
cosmopolitan basis of Renaissance knowledges. These two orienta-
tions are connected in the sense that both have their origin on the 
continent: both modernity and knowledge came, in this instance, 
from abroad and they came as hotly disputed terms. In invokiJ?g these 
outside causes Fraunce was concerned not simply to recognise but 
also to translate and rewrite the foreign terms. In an ironic self-
parody Fraunce writes: 'Good God what a world is this? \\'hat an age 
do we live in? A sophister of times past was a title of credit, and a word 
of commendation, now what more odious? Aristotle then the father of 
philosophy, now who less favoured? .. Antiquity is [now] nothing 
but dunsicaHty, and one's fore fathers' inventions unprofitable 
trumpery.' Such was the iconoclastic character of the modern age: it 
challenged the inherited forms, it questioned the wisdom of the 
classics, it sought to rewrite the dogma of an elliptical and veiled past 
b~' drawing it rowards the contemporary and, in the case of English 
1<1 \.,. to\'\.·ards the contincnt as well. 
The institutional and specifically the legal protCss ioH~ ' response to 
the 'moderns', to an intellrctual movcment concerned to open the law 
to the possibilities of intellectual history and comparative criticism, is 
curiously familiar to contemporary cars. The profession had its own 
procedures, its own method and its own history; it was indeed the 
best, most perfect and most ancient of all the professions and of all the 
systems of law. To challenge these internal features of the institution 
would be to participate in a nihilistic or at least straightforwardly and 
pointlessly destructive fragmentation of genteel tradition and 
venerable usage; it would destroy unnecessarily the grand narrative 
A Short History of Failure 
49 
oflegal progress and tear down the honoured forms, the separateness, 
the security, the dirference of the profession. More than that, if law 
wa~ not revered as a practice unto itself, social order would be likely 
to. IOdeed undoubtedly would, decay and the polity would eventually 
be torn limb from limb: its language, its consensual forms of co-
existence, its harmonies and hierarchies would all be shattered. I And 
all this for no practical purpose; the critics were philosophers and not 
lawyers, educators and not practitioners. What could they possibly 
know of the dreadful particularities, the intricate procedures and the 
signi.ficant forms ora Jaw that was as much a matteroffolk memory, of 
eth~lc geisl or at least of an oral tradition and communis opinio iuris, of a 
tacit knowledge, as it was of explicit textual rules? And again, how 
c~~l~ a comparative criticism based upon continental philosophy and 
CIVIlIan law have any relevance to the insular tradition, to the specific 
u~ag~s of our commOn law, our England? Had not Fortescue already 
dlsm.lssed the continentals and their obsessive sophistry, their 
caSUIstry based upon Justinian'S imperial. law with its absurd 
principle of principium placita? The polemic that Fraunce attempted to 
maugurate was thus one which touched the nerves, the economic and 
political patience, of the established and growing profession; it raised 
questions in which the stakes were high; it 'in fact concerned the 
interpretation and control over the philosophical (and hence 
rel~gious) canon, over the minds of contemporaries and youth, and so 
ultImately, over a major form of social and political power, at least 
within the educational institutions ofEurope'.2 In a culture in which 
it is ~ad manners, ungentle and perhaps dishonourable to talk politics 
outSide of the specific. institutional sites of political discourse it is 
surprising that Fraunce here met with silence: why talk to Ihc.s; who 
lack professional knowledge and worse still probably lack breedi~g as 
well? In Coke's unequivocal formulation, 'alas our books of law seem 
to them to be dark and obscure; but no wise will impute to the laws 
but to their ignorance, who by their sole and superficial reading of 
them cannot understand the depth of them. I will not sharpen the nib

Eucharistic presence, we may start precisely with this quality of 
otherness that presence implies. 
Of the Bod} and of its Sacrifice 
The first words of divine presence and equally of the ritual 
recollection of that presence concern the body: 'this is my body' (hoc 
esl corpus meum). However, it is not clear, linguistically, what 'this' 
refers to, whether the bread or the body. 'This' has a general and 
confused reference to a presence, to something present, a body, but it 
transpires that it is an invisible body of which 'this' is no more than 
symptom. 'This' does not refer directly to any single or particular 
material body; it refers to a complex sign of presence and more 
specifically to a sacrifice which will constitute a particular species of 
body and of presence. Ironically, the breaking of the bread is 
indicative of a sacrifice, a crucifixion, the destruction of a body so as to 
cleanse or remit or simply to make a new body. The question of what 
this body is, which body, remains disputable. In the Catholic 
tradition the bread represents a hidden body. the body of Christ 
'which was given for you', a body which it transpires was in fact 
sacrified so as to save the order of believers. It is thus the s,.>,rifi~ial 
body with which we are concerned: the boer. this bod 
s to be 
rea ,to be seen t rough the act 01 sacn ce: 'for as ofrc;;n as yc eat this 
bread and drink chis Clip ye do shew Ibe I oed's death rjIJ he come' (I 
Corinthians I J: 26). 
It is an act of betrayal that establishes an order of belief; it is the 
destruction of a body that founds the social body and translates a 
visible presence into the immanent presence, the intimacy of (he 
divine or the corpus myslicum of the state. Sacrifice is the exemplary 
religions act: through destruction, through death or through some 
other symbolisation of disappearance, of the chance and irrationality 
of the imaginary, it draws its participants, its witnesses, away from 
the material world, the world of utility and of things, towards an 
invisible realm, one of foundations, of sovereignty, of the divine, a 
realm of myth. That sacrifice is necessary is a matter of ensuring 
obedience to the gods, but then also'to knowledge, to an inaugural 
legitimacy or space of foundation: 'the greatest negation of the real 
order is the one most favourable to Ihe appearance of the mythical 
The Eucharist and English Law 59 
order'. 1 I t is from that space, that mythical order of invisible presence, 
that the law must speak: 
[I]t is from this perspective, one in which the symbolic sacrifice 
necessarily accompanies the creation of a foundational [sociaJ) space, 
that the question of ( law] must be re-examined. At the bottom of such an 
interrogation, we can see without difficulty the essential and inescapable 
political questions that face hy~r-industrial societies. What are the 
forms of sacrifice in such societies?2 
This is also to ask not only what are the forms of immolation (of 
consumption) but also what are the forms of betrayal, complicity and 
guilt that lead the participants back to the site of destruction, the 
symbolic place of sacrifice? 
Intimacy and Authoriry 
In secularised legal terms, the sacrifice founds the authority oflaw; it 
establishes the state as the social body, the invisible or mystic 
continuance that was the Crown and became the sovereignty of 
Parliament. In terms of positive law, the sacrifice is symbolic: 
prosaically, it simply denotes the sub'ection of the individual to law 
of the smgu ar 
y to the social body, of the physical to the spiritual. 
The constitution, the invisible and unwri e 
aw oflaws that founds 
t e English state, can gnly properly be said to exist in the rt:alm of 
legal fiction; it is this body, this law! this corlJus iurisof which the citizen 
is a subject by virtue of the sacrifice DCa portion ofrealjty a sacrifice 
traditionally symbolised in jurisprudence by a social contract in 
which the individual relinquishes a series of oat ural rights and powers 
to Leviathan or a sovereign body so as to become a member of tbat 
order or continuance that the social body represents. The sacrifice 
engenders a community based upon the intimacy of having given 
something up, of having let something go; the complicity of assassins 
is also the intimacy of community for 'what is intimate, in [a] strong 
sense, is what has the passion of an absence ofindividuality'.3

neither authority nor any active role to play. The university was left to 
emulate the profession and either to imitate its internal procedures of 
reasoning-or to suffer irrelevance. We can go further. It is commen-
tary which makes a theory of memory possible; it is interpretation 
which relates memory to the lifeworld and tradition to that which is 
lived. Without commentary, both as method and as institutional 
place, tradition lacks life; il remains an external and spectral 
presence, a faith that calls down an absent source to remedy through 
spiritual presence an otherwise dis invested life. It is memory as 
initiate haUucination, as hollow form, as uninhabited space. That is 
the fate of the common law and the significance of Fraunce's failure. 
That is where he fell and where the common law rose in his place. 
When the dues are paid, however, is it not more likely that any critical 
form of legal scholarship in the common law world will judge 
Fraunce's fall as more heroic and more potent, as more significant 
and more memorable, than the idle passion or dance of death that 
took his place? To lose a battl~ is not to lose the war: logos throws many 
shadows, memory harbours (as repression) that which was forgotten, 
the common law stiJl awaits its scholars and a hiStory that exceeds the 
merely antiquarian, a memory that goes beyond the dormant 
immobility of the display case or the curio shop, a tradition in short 
that finalJy steps out of the mus~um of precedent.

The Eucharist and English Law: 
A Genealogy of Legal Presence 
in the Common Law Tradition 
'At supper ... Not where he eats but where he is eaten.'1 
Memory is always the memory of presence. To understand a 
tradition, to understand a law based upon precedent, one therefore 
needs to understand not simply the order of its memories but the 
theory of presence that those memories imply. For the common law 
tradition, for the science of jurisprudence that blossomed on the soil 
that had been barren for Abraham Frauncc's theory of historical 
memory, the theory of presence returns us to the Anglican tradition. 
It is in the debates between Sir Thomas More arid Tyndale over the 
proper translation of the Bible, over the meaning of the sacraments 
and so also over the meaning of 'ecClesia'; between Sir Thomas More 
and Saint German over methods of interpretation and the correct 
language of the law; in the oath of supremacy; in Richard Hooker's 
defence of the old English order:'? and in Coke's attack on the 
historians, on Hotman in particular, that we can piece together the 
elements that make up the English tradition and its constitution, that 
of the common Jaw. The legal tradition had its basis, its foundation, in 
a notion oftradition and of polity that was borrowed directly from the 
Anglican Church. While there is nothing suprising in the translation 
oftheoJogy, of religious concepts, into secular law, the details of that 
process of translation have been sufficiently ignored by the anti-
quarians who pass for historians of the common law to justify a dose 
analysis of the Eucharist and its meaning for English law.

MEMORY , PRECEDENT AND WRITING SYSTEMS OF LAW 
Again with reference to Bataille, 'this sacramental element is 
revelation of continuity through the death of a discontinuous 
... divine continuity is linked with the transgression of the law 
which the order of discontinuous beings is built'.1 Translated into the 
terms of the common law, the continuity of presence is exemplified 
precisely through the removal of the discontinuous, through 
expulsion - either literal or symbolic - of the transgressor, in each act 
of judgment, in each affirmation of the law, in each 'discovery' or ; 
presencing of the immemorial rules. The presence of the law, its 
memory of itself, its ritual of identification is one of repetition: it is 
monumental because presence is never simply presence, and repeti-
tion too is always more than the return of the same. 
Sign, Text, Word 
Finally, and not insignificantly, consider the relation of the sacra- ' 
ment, and of memory, to the text. The Reformation was amongst 
other things a dispute over the nature of a particular sign or set of 
signs. In the first instance, Catholicism can be defined as a defence of 
the difficulty, the opacity of the sign and so also of the scriptures. The 
Eucharistic sign, 'this' thing here present, indicated for Catholicism a 
thing, bread, which, in its material form, hid the body of Christ. The 
bread is in that sense symbolic. Its presence is indexical. Behind it will 
be discoverc:d its history, the allegory of its origin, and thereby its 
meaning will be revealed: that which this thing, this bread, 
symbolises will have Leen disclosed, The absence which underlies, 
and surrounds, all presence will have been represented, ~he 'truth' of 
the object laid bare to the eyes of grace. The scriptures bear the 
authority of 'Gad that speaks it? 'they are they which testify of me' 
Gohn 5: 39) and their meaning is for Sir Thomas More in 
consequence a complex combination of levels of sense. The text is 
both literal and allegorical, metaphorical and anagogic; its sense is 
spiritual for: 
(S]ometime he wrote it, and our saviour himself sometimes spoke his 
words in such wise, that the letter had none other sense than mysteries 
and allegories ... which sense God that composed the leuer, did when 
he made it foresee, and more did set thereby than by the seme that 
Bataille (19R6), op. cit., p. 82. 
2 Sir Thomas More, ApoitJg}e (IS33, London), fol. 31b. 
Til< Eucharist and English Law 63 
.: immediately rises upon the Icuer, which letters his high wisdom so 
tempered for th~ express purpose ... (hat such other sense might be 
therein and drawn out thereof, by such as himself had 
. determined to have the grace 10 find it. I 
In linguistic terms, the theory of the sacramental sign is indissoci-
from the theory of the text. The Catholic concept of the Eucharist 
reductionist in the sense that it took the elements of the Eucharist 
'seDaral.e\". In particular it distrusted the immediate sign, and so 
language was the object of analysis the meaning or the text was 
be viewed as external to the text itself. The text, scripture, was 
.' formally incomplete; it required interpretation, exegesis and, in a full 
sense, tradition to complete it. Just as the sacrament required the 
consecratory words of the priest to change its substance. so the 
scriptures required the consecratory application of tradition, the 
. authority of the cleric, of the priest as interpreter, to complete its 
meaning, It is precisely that precedence of the Church over the 
scriptures to which T yndale and the reformers most objected: 'Judge 
'" therefore reader whether the pope with his Church, whether their 
: authority be above the scripture: whether all they teach without 
scriptures be equal with the scripture, whether they have erred, , . 
and against the mist of their sophistry take the examples that are 
passed down in the old testament ... judge them in all things. '2 ~

VIII, who already had the title of Fidei Defensor (Defender of the 
Faith), beeame head of both Church and Stale, of the Lords spiritual 
and temporal, of the law natural and positive. 
How the Anglican Church resolved the question of Eucharistic 
presence became, by virtue of the Reformation in England, a question 
of state. a secular and legal question as well as a matter of strict 
theology. For the purposes of understanding the legal tradition that 
emerges from that century, for the purposes of understanding·our 
tradition and our law, we need to understand that law as having a 
source which combines both spiritual and temporal authority. We 
also need to understand the tradition that emerges most explicitly in 
the writings of Sir Edward Coke and Sir John Davies, as being an 
authoritative tradition, a tradition drawn from and backed by the 
Church. To understand the theory of sources and of memory and 
interpretation that the lawyers put forward we need to understand 
interpretatation as such, interpretation as being governed by the 
tneory of logos. the theory of the Eucharistic presence as well as of the 
Incarnate word which St ohn laces al th 
. "in as so rc and 
as light and trut (John r: I). We will begin with a description of the 
elements of Eucharistic theory. and then move to examine the parallel 
discourse of lawyers, the founding documents of the common law 
curriculum as it established itself at th~ 'third university', the Inns of 
Court. I Our account will be both conceptual and historical: we begin 
with a conceptual model and interpretation of certain aspects of the 
Eucharistic tradition and then relate that model to the parti(ular 
history of an Anglican common law. 
The Eucharist 
The narrative of the Eucharist is a foundational one. It is not only 
that, as Freud discusses at length in Totem and Taboo,2 the story of a

sacrifice lies at the basis of all rdigious and legal traditions, but rather 
that the particular character of that sacrifice will determine, in 
metaphysical terms, the forms of sociality, the nature of the com-
munity and of its law. It will do so precisely because the Last Supper 
is an account of the foundin of communit of the establishment of an 
or er 0 memory and of the authority of that memory, its law. It is 
through the ceremony of Communion, through the ritual of the 
Eucharist, that the dlvme IS made human, that the word becomes 
flesh, that authonty IS made prescot. 
First, the notion of presence itself. Throughout any account of the 
Eucharist there runs a theme of presence: the ritual of the Eucharist is 
one of representation; it Ire-presences' through the imagery of the 
Communion, through the bread and the wine and through the words 
that accompany them, a presence that is absent, a past presence; the 
signs used in the Communion provide a substitute or duplicate of a 
presence that is not present in tither the time or the place of ritual 
enactment. The Eucharistic presence is in a literal sense a simulation. 
In a spiritual sense, however, the presence that is represented is more 
real than the real; it is the presence of the Spirit, of grace, of the sacred; 
it is presence in the strong sense of prat-stTLr,1 that is, of something both 
before and in advance of the senses, something continuous with but in 
excess of an object, an anticipacion and an imminence that negates, 
suspends, both time and space by virtue of the power of the event, of a 
sacrament that 'is a ··reality complete unto itself, that has an 
independent existence , .. we must recall that the sacramental is 
altogether sui genens'.2 If we list the specific attributes of the 
occasions we recognize the after·effects ofthat crime which so oppressed men, but 
of which Ihey must have been proud. At bottom, however, the Christian 
communion is a new s("uing aside oflhe father, a repetition of,he crime that must 
bt expiated.' 
1 On the etymology of presence see E. Iknvenistc, P,ohllnw tit li~ .. ijliqut 
gMaie (1964, Paris), pp. 132-9. On the impossibility of understanding presence 
except as a unity of diverse elements, as an image that embodies a history and a 
future, see L. Marin ({g86), op. cil., pp. 21irl1 , 213-16. For a comparable- point

which, like More's Church, regards the visible only insofar as it is a 
veil of the invisible: 'the outward sensible signs in all the sacraments 
and holy ceremonies of Christ's Church, by one general and common 
signification of them all, bytokcn and docs signify ... an inward 
secret gift and inspiration ofgrace'.l Finally to interpret the law is the 
task of the priesthood, for these are no ordinary signs, no ordinary 
words, no common texts. For More and for Coke they remain in the 
Latin and the French to protect the ignorant and lO preserve the 
truth. :2 
The Time and Place of an EnglishJurisprudence 
The emergence of an English jurisprudential literature, a legal 
dogmatics, may be traced with some precision to a genre of legal 
writing that first appeared in the closing decades of the sixteenth 
century. In a superficial sense, this new genre was exclusively 
concerned with questions of method and was based upon a series of 
reversals. While earlier jurisprudential literature had accepted the 
civilian definition oflaw as 'true philosophy', it had not developed as 
a distinctive discipline or science. For the bulk of the fifteenth and 
sixteenth centuries, studies of the philosophy and method of law were 
to be found in surprisingly disparat~ dialogues and tracts. Advice on 
the sources oflaw and the forms orIegal interpretation ",!,as to be found 
in religious polemics,] in rhetoricarmanuals,· in notarial handbooks

MEMORY, PRECEDENT AND WRITlfIoG SYSTEMS OF LAW 
In psychoanalytic terms, the sacrifice and its repetition in sacri· 
fidal rituals, in Communion but also in punishment, binds the law to 
the power of the symbolic. The sacrifice is an original act afforce; the 
community founds itself through the kiIHng of the father, through an 
act offoundational violence which comes subsequently to be repeated 
in purely symbolic forms; the original violence lies in wait, its threat 
founds an order of law, of obedience to rules, of behavioural 
normality: 
Th<: fathtr that founds the human social community is the internalised, 
spiritual father. And this forces us to see that the socialisation does not 
bind through a persistence in memory of the image of the real threat of 
aggression from a more powerful other ouuide, but through the 
eucharist by which the paternal reality, now vanquished and abolished, 
is constituted as an internal imperative that makes the libido speak, that 
is, address itself as the demand of the other. 1 
The acceptance, the internalisation, of authority in the Eucharist can 
thus be understood as a re-enactment of the sacrifice and of that 
which the sacrifice most immediately stood for: in giving his body and 
shedding his blood, Christ submitted to his Father's will, he died that 
others might be redeemed, but more, he died for his Father-literally, 
pro patria mori. Christ's 'self·oblation to death'2 is mimicked in each 
Communion service; the communicant, in remembering the Last 
Supper, remembers also that he must be prepared to die, to offer 
himself, if the need arise, if God wills, to be sacrificed. The presence 
that is duplicated in the Eucharist is a presence of self.-oblation, of 
submission. 
Memory, Memorial and Law 
The Eucharist represents a sacrifice and it should be remembered 
that it is one function and indeed one meaning of sacrifice that it 
introduces the sacred, the sacra.3 How then can one understand t~e 
bond be established which united the panicipants with each other and with their 
god,'

Th, Eucharist and English Law 6. 
Eucharist other than as a constant reminder, an endlessly repeated 
memory of the sacred, of its existence, of its presence? The Commun· 
ion commemorates, it recollects, it is done 'in remembrance of me') 
and each time that it is done it proclaims a faith by way of living 
memory, by way of repetition, What is crucial is that such a sacrificial 
rite of memory constitutes that which is remembered as a mem'Jrial, 
as something morc than simple or mere mem6ryj it is, through bread 
and wine and consecratory words, a return to an origin, an allegory of 
its continuance and an institutionalisation of an unimpeachable and 
authoritative presence. The signs of the Eucharist are more than 
simple references. as Bataille argues: their sacrificial quality returns 
servile objects to the sacred world. It also turns an act of recollection 
into a monument of the past, a memory of presence into a sacral 
assembly, a mystery, a church (ecclesia). 
Two aspects oflhe form of Eucharistic memory deserve a degree of 
emphasis. There is first the quality of a memory that does not simply 
recollect a past presence, in symbolic or iconic or imaginary form : 
through the sacrame'nts, the memory of the Church is onc which 
reproduces that presence, which changes the reality of the partici-
pants by means ofa transubstantiation. ~bread and wine becomes 
flesh and blood. a simple assembly becomes a church and the visible 
;;'rld slips through the veil of things into the presence of the invisible. 
Such is the power of sacrificial memory that we can go further and 
briefly redefine the presence that such memory invokes as being more 
than simple presencej it is, indeed, the presence of the immemorial, of 
the beginning, an originary presence which is of crucial importance 
because what such presence signifies is the continuity of the origin: 
presence can here only be understood as carrying the entire panoply 
of [he past with it. Presence is not what is before the eyes. it is not what 
is direcd ex erienced; resence is indexical it is ral-Uns in advance 
o t e senses, in excess of the immediate, imminent, the bearer of a 
history, ?_ predefined alchemical being.] It is also the law, not simply 
oecause it is that presence, that genealogy, that parental power of the 
origin that is ingested by each communicant, but more that the 
sacrificial memory draws us back to the continuity of the sacred, to a 
truth that unites the living Church against all threats of discontinuity.

MEMORY, PRECEDENT AND WRITING SYSTEMS OF LAW 
the certainties of doctrinal transmission. The first question concerns 
the impetus or motive of closure. The earliest accounts of a systematic 
jurisprudence and accompanying hermeneutic present the common 
law tradition as being radically separate - in geographical, historical, 
linguistic and institutional terms - from all other contemporary , 
discourses. Either it is, as Coke saw it, an antidote to other discourses 
-
an immunisation against foreign influences -
or it is lO be 
understood more simply as prior discourse. preceding and in . 
consequence also defining and structuring those other discourses with 
which it comes into contact. The properly genealogical question 
which the impetus towards closure raises is that of the hidden 
filiations of an exclusory discourse. The legal hermeneutic is one of 
annunciation and it is consequenlly unaccountable in its immediate 
forms of presentation. The genealogical reconstruction of doctrine, 
however, interestingly implicates legal doctrine in a series of other 
discourses. It will be argued in historical detail that, far from being a 
technical and internal development, the new jurisprudence respon-
ded to and was moulded by a series of discourses external to law. 
Jurisprudence was marked by external discourses and desires, and its 
subsequent reformulations still carry those marks even though the 
historians of law prefer to recycle the juridical fiction of a true 
discourse and its authoritative judgments. 
The initial task of a genealogy of English jurisprudence is simply 
the supplementary. one of tracing the repressed discursive affilia-
tions of doctrine or, as discussed earlier, what Foucault termed the 
' unconscious' of a science.' In the first section of the ensuing 
argument I will trace the polemical context of legal doctrine. The 
printing press, the popular indictment of a massively expanding 
profession, the translation of the Bible, the perceived threat of 
continental philosophy and the nationalistic advocacy of vernacu-
lar languages all played a significant role in forcing the profession

both to authenticate the credentials of lawyers and to exclude any

was the little-attended yet more scholarly systematisation of a 
, or method of common law, a mnemonics associated with 
i" ·Ra~ism and the movement to modernise and vernacularise all the 
.: classical arts. The second part of the chapter will trace the 
disciplinary development of jurisprudence in relation to its con-
temporary domains of scholarship. The argument developed 
'. concerns the relationship of a legal hermeneutic to the emergence of 
the other vernacular disciplines and most particularly poetics, 
. rhetoric and dialectic. Scholasticism brought with it the theocratic 
dogmas of the Roman tradition. I The genealogical analysis oflegal 
scholarship at the time that it produced its first properly juris-
prudential literature indicates that the institutional expansion of 
the profession was accompanied by a comparable discursive 
imperialism. In developing a specifically legal hermeneutic, the 
new jurisprUdence advanced juridical notions of linguistic contract 
and of linguistic notation, of bonding or of faithful tie between word 
and referent, that far exceed the specifically legal context of their 
initial elaboration. 
The Polemical Context' 
English jurisprudence arrived at its proper destination or found its 
appropriate dogmatic role somewhat late in history, arguably over 
three centuries after comparable devdopments within the continental 
legal tradition, While there are dear intimations of a desire to provide 
a defence of the legal faith in Fortescue's De Laudibus Legum Ang/iaeof 
1460, it is only with the advent of print that the threat of a legal 
reformation becomes sufficiently immediate to require the estab-
lished institution to develop a systematic and systematically pol em i-
cal legal apologetics. The development of a doctrinal defence oflaw 
a.dopts precisely the same strategies and the same struCture of 
argument as had the defence of the established Church against the 
foreign popularising creed of Protestantism and the vernacular 
translation of the Bible. A dogmatic theology of law needed to base

The thesis is easy. So too is proving it. I t is in the language and it is not 
a surprising argument. There is a clearly discernible parallel, at the 
level of structure, at the level of argument and of language as well, 
between Sir Thomas More's defence of the faith and Sir Edward 
Coke's defence of the law. There is, indeed, a conceptual descent, 
from More through Richard Hooker to Coke and Davies in which the 
Eucharistic apparatus of presence - of authority, of law - moves from 
theology to jurisprudence, from the Church lO the State, from the 
sacrifice of Christ lO the sacrifice of nature and of desire that founds 
the social contract. In the place of the last supper and its exemJ?lary

What is done by the social body is done by each and everyone of its 
members. In the words of Sir Thomas Smith in Dt Republica AngLorum. 
Parliament is where 'cverie Englishman is entended to bee there

Following the order of analysis of the Eucharistic enactment of 
presence, the transition from theology to jurisprudence can be traced 
in relation to comparable concepts. The defence ofehe Catholic faith 
and the Latin language of the Church by Thomas More, and the 
defence of tradition and the old order of law by Hooker, both provide 
an essentially conservative conceptual language of social and legal 
order that find their terminus in Coke and Davies and the tradition 
which they establish. By way of introduction, the following points 
may be observed, Firstly, in terms of the source oflaw, all our authors 
are agreed that it belongs ultimately to the divine order of the Lord, 
an order both established and recollected or made present through 
the Eucharist. In Hooker's words, 'whatsover hath necessary being, 
the Son of God doth cause it to be , . . a thing of so great use as 
. government amongst men, and human dominion in government, 
cannot choose but be originally from him'.2 Secondly, the authority of 
that law, its social body or contiryuance, is established in the society of 
law as our law, our tradition, God's presence amongst the English.

itselffirst upon a conception of sacral origination, of another time and 
place at the source oflegal communication or from whence legal signs 
arc writ and sent. I t needed secondly to elaborate a rigorously esoteric 
hermeneutic that would guard the legal missive from profane 
interpretations. With respect to both requirements, contemporary 
theological polemics provided the requisite conceptual apparatuses. 
Th"",as Mort's ugal Theology 
In the course ofa lengthy polemic against the lawyer Saint German, 
Thomas More remarks, during a discussion of misinterpretations of 
his work, that 'if their books be once put abroad in print, it is a thing 
very hard to get them well in again'.J In a later addition to the same 
dispute, More echoes this fear of the ready diffusion of heretical ideas 
made available through print, in this case the criticism of laws and 
statutes, in remarking that 'be they of the church or the realm ... to 
put out books in writing abroad among the people against them, that 
I would neither do myself, nor in the doing commend any man that 
does'.2 More's fear was a commonly expressed one on the part ofche 
~stabli~hed Church and it adequately captures one of the principal 
mgredlents of the transformation in cultural communication intro-
duced by the presses. While it has been convincingly shown in the 
work of Stock, Clanchy and others' that the scribal age had laid the 
foundations for a culture of books, the scale of dissemination of 
heretical ideas made possible by printing was an indispensable 
element in the Reformation. As is adequately noted by Eisenstein,i 
the shift in the ",lode of production of books took place at the expense 
of the monastenes and of the clergy, and one of its more immediate 
consequences was that of challenging the privileges of clerical and

legal elites. I The initial manner in which it did so was relatively 
indirect and took the form of the translation of the Bible. A coincident 
advocacy of national languages that would support a market for the 
vernacular scriptures became a principal obje~t of doctrinal debate. 
Scribal culture had been a preserve of the Church and had barely 
managed to supply the needs of the priesthood for liturgical and 
devotional works. Print technology shattered the restraints of the 
scribal culture and its limited distribution of texts. It was seen for that 
reason by some as an instrument of the Dc:vil,2 and bibliolatry (the 
inkc:-divinitic) entered the list of sins condemned by the Catholic 
·Church. One of the main threats represented by print was that of 
secularisation and popularisation of religious and legal texts. In 
political terms, the Reformers threatened the established Church by 
preferring the authority of the scriptures to that of the hierarchy, of 
the patristic tradition: the word is before the faith, and faith makes the 
congregation. The primacy of the word returns to a beliefin the 'living 
word', the word as a sacrament for 'tht: word was flesh, and dwelt· 
among us ... full of grace and truth'.3 Scripcure itself is the ,sourCe o( 
life; it is both tradition and text, signifter and signified. In doctrinal 
terms this threat of a democratic Church is manifested in acerbic 
debates on language, and most particularly on the primacy of [he 
word as against the authority of the Church (traditio), debates which 
included elaborate analyses of the significance of signs, miracles and 
sacraments. For Tyndale, the Eucharist must be understood as 
guaranteeing the New Testament; it provides it both with depth and 
with feeling (intimacy), precisely because of the sacrifice which it 
recollects: 
God wrote his testament unto them [the sons of Adam1 in all ways ... for 
the sacrifices which God gave Adam's sons were no dumb puppetry or 
supersticious Mahometic, but signs of th~ testament of God. And in 
them they read the word of God as we do in books and we should do in 
[he sacraments, ifthe wicked pope had not laken the significacions away 
from us, as he had robbed us of the true sense of the scripture.i 
The reformers were therefore textualist5, believing in the literal and 
accessible truth of the scriptures and the sacraments. For Tyndaie,

MEMORY, PRECEDENT AND WRITlNG SYSTEMS Of LAW 
poHtical theorists, grammarians and rhetoricians. By the first decades 
of the seventeenth century, that order of precedence and of disciplines 
had been reversed. A distinctive jurisprudential literature now 
emanated virtually exclusively from the Inns of eo un, and its explicit 
object of study was no longer a branch of some other discipline - of 
theology, rhetoric or poetics - but rather a discrete concern with a 
specifically English legal method and exclusively juridical forms of 
study and of argumentation. 
The most immediate context of the new discourse was that of a 
response to the importation of continental theory and specifically that 
brand of scholasticism associated with Petrus Ramus and Omar 
Talon. 1 It was to a dogmatic and largely uncritical version of 
Ramism and to the aUuring slogans of a nascent modernity that the 
systematiscrs of common law turned in their occasional efforts to 
justify a dogmatic science that would ideally both reflect the glories of 
the English tradition and equally stand comparison with the 
philological or scientific exactitude of the contir:.entallawycrs and the 
glossatorial transmission of ratio scripta. Initially intended as little 
more than a gloss upon, or re·ordering of, the traditional poetic and

its tropes of certitude and truth to present a discrete apologetic and 
pedagogical account of the method of English law. The subjection of 
common law to the principles of scholastic method enabled the new 
jurisprudential literature to present a properly doctrinal account of 
the disparate strands of the legal tradition. The common law became 
in their texts a unitary discourse, a professional icriture, a unique 
discursive logic, and ultimately an empire of truth supported by a 
veridical language or orthodoxy that was peculiar to tht: law alone. [n 
short, the imported and translated scholastic philology enabled the 
doctrinal systematisers to establish a common law hermeneutic or, by 
its classical name, a science of interpretation (scientia inurpretalionis). 
True to its name, the function of such a ht:rmeneutic was to herald or 
to announce the truths of legal discourse in a didactic and oracular 
way. The truths in question were drawn from elsewhere, from time 
immemorial or from divine law, and only doctrine or the peculiar 
hermeneutic of the common law could safely extract them from their 
textual custody in the appropriately foreign languagt:s of the ancient 
tradition.

foresaw full well himself that many godly allegories holy men should 
by his inspiration at divers limes draw out thereof. And sometime he 
wrote it . .. that the letter had none other sense than mysteries and 
allegories.' , 
The parallel between {he defence of the established Church and its 
ordinaries and the legal institution whose 'inkhorn' texts were also 
made visible by print is foreseen by More at one point in the 
Confutacyon. T yndale in his Answer repeatedly raises the question of 
why necessary points of the faith should have been omitted from the 
scriptures, to which More responds that the argument 'is much as 
Tyndale would affirm that all the laws of England be written, and 
whatsoever were unwritten were no law. And when he had long 
wrestled therewith and could not prove it, would then ask me, has the 
realm of England any laws that be not written? to what purpose I pray 
you should they be left unwritten?'2 More's answer to that ques tion 
in relation to the common law comes in his later polemic with Saint 
German in terms of the sovereign power of the judiciary: 'But surtly 
(as I have often heard that great wise and right worshipped man Sir 
John Fineux say, late Chief Justice of the King's Bench) who so takes 
from a justice the order of his discretion, takes surely from him more 
than half his office. '3 Elsewhere, in the course of a lengthy and 
repetitive polemic, the argument in support of the esoteric tradition 
and institutional interpreters of the law occurs again and again, 
primarily in relation to More's advocacy ofthe ex officio suit under the 
statute De HaeTtlico CombuTendo,4 whereby heretics could be sum~ 
moned by the ordinaries upon suspicion of heresy and without the 
need for indictment or open accusation . ~

from its religious beginnings into a movement for the vernacular and 
for standardisation in all the disciplines. In his Treatise Concerning the 
Division btiwun lIlt SpiTiluo/iJy and Temporality, Saint German attacked 
the authority of the Church and the abuses of the canon lawyers in a 
vernacular polemic. I His theme and his method of arguing according 
to ordinary language (somcsays) is reasserted in Salem and Bi,-a"f1ce. In 
response to Morr's criticism of his having thereby grossly overpubli-
ciscd abuses offaith and law, Saint German defends his tract and its 
vernacular presentation on the grounds that 'the said treatise was 
made for the people of this realm, and therefore the English tongue in 
this realm was the most convenient' .'.1 The crucial aspect of the 
debate between Saint German and Sir Thomas More is that in this 
later polemic the object of controversy explicitly becomes the relation 
between spirituality and temporality. Arguments as to abuses of 
procedure, obscurities oflanguagr, misinterpretation of texts and of 
,judicial powers on the part oflhe spirituality, the 'ordinaries', are now 
intcrlaced with discussion and criticism of the common law and its 
'ordinaries', its judges. More 'would the temporality and the 
spirituality as the body and soul of one man, live well together and 
neither of them be glad to hear evil of the other . .. but drawn both by 
one line, according to both laws' cease all criticism of the hierarchy. 
For Thomas More the arguments are the same whether it be one 
law or the other, the Church or the secular law of the realm, that is to 
be defended against misinterpretation and popular criticism. As 
regards the spiritual law, and equally the authority of its clerics and 
scribes, we saw in dctail that the Church precedes the word. The 
argument is both historical and conceptual. In historical terms, the 
faith existed and was preached and taught by word of mouth, by 
custom transmitting tradition from age to age, long before the advent 
of the scriptures. Indeed ' the right faith which Adam had and such as 
in the samc faith succeeded him long ere writing began, was taught by 
the word of God unwritten' .3 In conceptual terms, the spoken word, 
the spirit (i.e. breath) that gives life, was often more effective and 
more appropriate to a contcxt than the written: ' the apostles did more 
plainly speak, and more openly declared, many things by mouth 
among the christian folk because their audience was more mete .. . 
than they did by their writing, which might by chance come into the

thrrin'. The common lawy~rs inhabit a fantastical and delirious ' 
mental realm; blindness, reverie and babble supplant any order or 
rul~ of r.ight reason as the profession 'apply themselves to fulfilling of 
thelT vam pleasures and foolish fantasy; wherefore they be taken, as it 
were, with a common frenzy'.J It was not, of course. Roman law but 
rather,the ~eformation and the printing presses that gained a varying ' 
reception In England and with them came an ever more vehement 
and popular denunciation of the 'dunsmen' lawyers and their 
'dunsicalities'.2 On the continent Lillher condemned ~uristerey' as a 
'doctrine not of grace but of wrath' and law itself as ugly dogma.llt 
may also be noted that a more general resistance to the growth of the 
legal profession in Europe saw civilian lawyers expelled from 
Hungary in the 1460s,4 banned from the Spanish colony of Peru in 
.IS29.~ subjected to varying oaths most commonly forbidding 
Immoral argument, Jies and inflated fees,6 and equally subjected to 
abuse and being labelled as chicaneux,1liars, blasphemers and fools . 
In England the popular attack on the lawyers was only slightly 
slower and lacked none of the vigour of the continental reformists.' 
Its pri~cipal themes are those of the number of lawyers, delay, 
uncertainty, expense, autocracy, pomposity and incomprehensibil-
ity, to which more learned critics added rampant particularism with

reference to the law of misprision, procedural abuses,' 
': ,excessive fines, poor scholarship and worse rhetoric. As regards the 
more popular criticisms, complaints as to excessive fees and malprac-
· tice2 are sufficiently common for Anthony Munday in a formulary 
rhetoric published towards the end of the sixteenth century to include 
the argument that a lawyer is a profitable member of the common-
weal as one of a list of paradoxes against common opinion which the 
· aspirant advocate had to defend by way oflearning by ordeal. The list 
· also included exercises in praise of blindness, poverty, ignorance and 
deformity.l Another striking version of popular sentiments which 
s,tresses the excessive number of lawyers and the pervasiveness of 
their categories comes from the introduction to Fulbecke's PaTal/elt: 
And I have had a very great desire ~o have some understanding of law, 
because I would not swim against the stream, nor be unlike unto my 
neighbours, who are so full of law-points, that when they sweat it is 
nothing but law; when they breath it is nothing but law, when they 
sneeze it is perfect law, when they dream it is profound law. The book of 
Littleton's Tenures is their breakfast, their dinner, their tea (boier] , their 
supper and their rare banquet.4 
The underlying current and theme, however, was that of legal 
language which preciscJy prevented acquisition of the knowledge for 
which Fulbecke's 'country man' pleads. The preponderant argument 
was initially simply that it made no sense to expect the subjects of the 
realm to know and obey a law so coloured, 'hotchpotch' and 'inkhorn' 
in its languages as to make lillie sense even to those learned in the 
mysteries oflaw.

MEMORY, PRECEDENT AND WRITING SYSTEMS OF LAW 
for the vernacular, the Catholic Church 'teaches not to know the 
scripture: but hides it in the Latin from the conlmon people, I For 
that reason the impetus of reform was centred upon the demand that a 
translation of the Bible be made commonly available; the scriptun~s 
should thereby be removed from the 'mist of (papal] sophistry" 
eStablished by the Church. It should be placed in the hands of a 
'feeling' faith, an immediate faith inscribed through the text on the 
heart, as opposed to an 'historical' (unwritten) faith based upon the 
authority of the Church. 
For T yndale, Barnes and their fellow reformers, the word preceded 
the Church; it was the truth, and the holy scripture was in 
consequence to be read as the truth, for 'the pith and substanct in 
general of everything necessary unto our soul's health, both of what 
h 
d 
" 
, 
we ought [0 believe, and what we oug t to 
0, was Written . 
Similarly, the sacraments should be taken out of the hands of the Pope 
and their meaning made plain by the texl as opposed to being hidden 
in the administrative power of the clerics and in puppetry and 
superstitious ceremonies, the 'howling, buzzing and crying out' of~h e 
Roman Church. In institutional terms, the demand that the scrip--
tures be placed in the hands of the public had two radical 
implications. Firstly, it challenged the supremacy of doctrine and in 
Tyndale's metaphor took the Bible from under the feet of the Pope 
where it had lain hidden 'in the Latin from the common people'. 
Further, 'rrom them that understand Latin they hide the true sense 
with a thousand false glosses . . . And I say that the pope keeps the 
scriptures as did the pharisees, to make merchandise of it. '. The 
second consequence of the argument was to deprive the 'ordinaries', 
the Church lawyers, of their power or interpretation. The scripture 
had 'the authority of him that sent it, that is to wit God, which the 
miracles did testiry, and not of the man that brought il'. ~ O f the 
ordinaries, Tyndalc remarks appropriately 'that they be lawyers 
ordained by the pope and can no more skill of the scriptures than they 
th3t never saw it , .. they be right hangmen to murder whosoever 
desires for the doctrine that God have given to be the ordinary of our 
faith'.6 Tyndale himself, of' course, later met his Maker at the hands 
of the hangmen lawyers. For Iranslating the Bible inappropriately, for

translating eee/aia as congregation not Church, for alleging an heret-
ical theory of immediate prescnce, Tyndale himse1rwas absented. 
For Thomas Morc, sometime reader at Lincoln's Inn and incum-
bent Lord Chancellor, T yndale was proud, presumptuous and 
unwise. He was a victim of continental theories and of dangerous 
modernist pretensions. Above all, 'it is the known Catholic Church 
that discerns the words of God from the words of men' and in 
consequence 'the people may have every necessary truth of scripture, 
and every thing necessary for them to know ... truly taught and 
preached unto them) though the corps an~ body of t~e s~ripture. be 
not translated into the mother tongue.' The hlstorlcal fa1th, 
protected and transmitted by the unwritten tradition of a Church 
which admittedly had frequently changed its mind, preceded the 
scriptures and determined what in those writings was true and what 
was false and unholy. The greatest authority rested with the 'word of 
God unwritten' and with the holy tradition that kept and interpreted 
it in accord with lts special and allegorical senses.2 The doctrinal 
argument saw the written word as a sign of grace and as a figure of 
holy mysteries: 'for our matter is not of scripture, as it is taken for bare 
writing, such as every scrivener's boy wrlt('s in his master's shop, but 
as it signifies such holy writing as God causes to be written and binds 
folk to believe, upon the peril of their sou['. 3 In institutional terms, 
the argument reasserts the necessity that the tnt be kept and 
protected by the Church, which alone can search the visible, the laws 
and 'outward sensible signs and sacraments',· to reveal their inward 
signification of grace. Drawing on the negative conclusions of a Royal 
Commission appointed by Henry VIII,~ More anticipates the very 
words ofIhe defenders oflaw French in arguing that a scripture in the 
English tongue would cause the unlearned to draw conclusions that 
would do them deadly harm. As to the professional interpreters of the 
text, 'God whose plenteous spirit wrote [endyghted] the scripture,

bad manners, poor form, un-English to be sure but also, and 
unpatriotic and seditious. 
The best known and most visible and enduring response to 
critics of England's tainted laws and venal profession was to adapt 
arguments as to their particularism and their history of 
influence and to turn them into a eulogy of the spirit of the 
enshrined in custom and legally presented in an idiosyncratic 
wholly English garb. The common law was to be interpreted as the 
presence of God in England, an antique tradition dressed in a 
sacramental language of its own, existent outside history and beyond 
memory as the intimate knowledge of a chosen profession. If ' 
historians were likely to be unwilling to accept Coke's claims to 
birthright extending back unalloyed to the first kings of the Britons 
(and even to the reign of Arthur), then 'to the grave and learned 
writers of histories, my advice is, that they meddle not with any point 
or secret of any art or science, especially with the laws of this realm, 
before they confer with some learned in the profession'. This is a view 
which is repeated when the records of the antiquity of the laws are 
said to be 'uetustalis el "eritalis fJestigia ... of that authority that they 
need not the aid of any historian ... it doth appear most plain by 
successive authority in history what I have positively affirmed out of 
record, that the grounds of our common laws at this day were beyond 
the memory or register of any beginning'. J History and legal history, 
in other words, are far from being branches of the same discipline; 
they are to be carefully separated according to the dictates of doctrine 
to allow the lawyers, in an ironic and proleptic turn, to have a history 
of their own invention in praise of national law: a history of the 
unwritten word of the law, of the Church that comes be:fl)re the word, 
of an historical faith which, following More's definition, is dependent 
upon the profession to discern the word of the law from the words of 
men, and further to reveal the inner signification of those words where 
they are written down. The tradition of an unwritten law passed by 
word of mouth or embedded in antique practice is in essence 
panegyric; it is a praise of indigenous law and a national faith, ofa law

The forging of the myth of a native legal tradition boch in the face of 
long history of hostility to law and lawyers and in contradiction ora 
.",mlber of apparent and known political and linguistic facts must, 
101IIally at least, have a distinctively polemical structure. It also, 
ironically, borrows much of its conceptual method and 
content from the civilians. 1 Elements of the general argument, 
however, are sophisticated and of importance to the parallel develop-
ment of an English jurisprudential tradition. The most obviously 
polemical feature of all of the doctrinal apologia is their particularism: 
work endeavours a detailed rebuttal of specific criticisms of 
EI"lish law and English lawyers. The points dealt with largely mirror 
criticisms elaborated earlier in terms of delay, uncertainty, 
procedural abuse, professional integrity, antiquity, language and 
.·mltio,nalisrn.' The laner three issues arc of central jurisprudential 
· sil~nifiC1mce as well as being constitutive of what might be termed the 
myth of English law, a doctrinal myth that lives on to the 
present. At all events the three categories are linked. The myth of 
antiquity is best viewed as a theory of sources {aucroritatesL of lost 
· origins that serve to equate the law with the word both written and 
unwritten. For English lawyers the Church (traditio) comes before the 
word and assigns the text its allegorical and other senses. Legal 
language has therefore to be seen as something more than profane; it

hands of heathen men',! The Church, in other words, was custodian 
and bearer of a hidden reserve of divine truths. The written word of 
God could thus not be trusted to imbue a reader with the correct faith 
unless such a reader also carried to the lext the full panoply of esoteric 
interpretative wisdoms that the ages and instilutions of the Church 
had handed out. Both laws must be prolected and their substance, 
together with any criticism of it, should rest hidden or secret in the

demand for a more stable use of precedent. One of the earliest of such 
critiques again comes in the context of a theological dialogue. I The 
dialogue between Cardinal Pole and Thomas Lupset is most often 
referred to as evidence of an argument in favour of a reception of 
Roman law in Renaissance England.2 While the possibility of 
codifying English law is certainly raised, it occurs in the course of a 
critical discussion of the chaotic state of common law precedent and 
the haphazard nature of judicial decision making: 
There is no stable ground therin, nor sure Slay; but everyone that can 
colour reason makes a stop to the best law that is before-time devised. 
The subtlety of one sergeant shall inert and destroy all the judgments of 
many wise men before-time received . . . The judgment of years be 
infinite and full of much controversy, and besidl~ that, of small authority. 
Thejudges are not bounden, as I understand, to follow chern as a rule.3 
Far from advocating the abandonment of English law in favour of the 
Roman, Pole is concerned that the national law be standardised, its 
procedural abuses remedied and its method rationalised. While 
Roman law could provide an exemplar of method and conceptual 
clarity, his 'wish' was 'that all these laws should be brought into some 
small number, and to be written also in our mother tongue' rather 
than the barbarous tongue of old French 'which serves no purpose 
else'.4 That his primary leaning was towards a national law is echoed 
in his repeated concern that the common law, this 'great blot on our 
polity', was a foreign import 'writ in a strange tongue, as though the 
Jaw were written to strangers', and he is unrestrained in his reference 
to 'the great infamy and rot that remains in us, to be governed by laws 
given us of such a barbarous nation as the Normans, be'.s 
The other significant theme of (he DiaJogul is one which castigates 
the legal profession and judiciary for being pharisees and making 
merchandise of the law and of justice: 'lucre and affection ruleth all

MEMORY, PRECEDENT AND WRITING SYSTEMS OF LAW 
discourse, however, was not primarily the profession but rather 
critics. The language of the law had been an obvious and eOI1St.nt 
focus of popular indictment. It was also seen, not unreasonably, 
lingering evidence of foreign and unreformed practices that 
scarcely be justified in the new age of print and 
translations. The doctrinal answer to such criticisms parallels 
annexation of history with an annexation of linguistics. FeOft''''u,, 
again set.s the tone with the inventive argument that because 
French is not a spoken tongue it has in effect managed to remain an 
original language, a pristine and pure scientific terminology, a 
tradition in its own right. If any comparison is to be made between 
legal language and the modern vernaculars, then the former must 
hold the day: 'modern French is not the same as that used by our 
lawyers in the Courts of Law, but is much altered and depraved by 
common use'.1 Appearances to the contrary, even language turns to 
gold in the copious arms of the law. 
Coke, Davies and others simply needed to expand the argument 
provided by Fortescue. Far from being illiterate remnants ofa scribal 
culture, the legal profession was entrusted with the sacred duty of 
preserving ~he special coinage of law. For this purpose they had, 
devised their own university, the Inns of Court, their own disciplinary 
technique of study and their own scientific lexicon. In the face of the 
popular experience of litigation as protracted and uncertain 
wrangling monopolised by the practitioners of ars bablativa, Coke and 
Davies simply assert the certainty of law and the clarity of its 
language. Where there arc doubts as to law, Coke argues, that is 
because it has been interfered with by Parliament or tampered with 
by the unlearned: in nominis vitium non professionis. 2 Legal language thus 
explicitly served the exclusory function ofkeeping the law within the 
legal institution and subject to the singular techniques of its 
interpretative tradition. This, according to Coke, would spare the 
unlearned from immolating themselves and their possessions through 
that the unwitten status of English law is to be explained by reference to the laws of 
Lycurgus of Sparta, introduced into England by the Saxons, See also W. 
Hakeworth in A Collection of CuriOUJ Discourses (1720, Oxford), pp.

Coke the 
simply proved its age, its 
and its integrity. It was vocabula artis, a compendious and' 
technical language best fitted to serve the longue durie oflegal use and 
record even though 'you shall meet with a whole army of words, 
which cannot defend themselves in bello grammaticali, in the gram-
matical war, and yet arc more significant, compendious, and effectual 
to express the true sense of the matter, than if they were expressed in 
pure Latin'. His argument in fact goes further than is apparent. The 
law is its language; the language itself carries the law, for its peculiar 
words, removed as they are from use and speech, 'are so woven into 
the laws themselves, as it is in a manner impossible to change them, 
neither ought legal terms to be changed'.2 The language of law is of 
itself the memory and the monument oflaw. Davies need simply add 
praiSe of that language to Coke's more sophisticated observations, his 
assertion being that 'we express the cases, arguments andjudgments 
of the law in a form of speech so plain, so significant, and in a tongue 
so soon learned by any man ... as I dare say there is no rational 
science in the world ... that is so clearly delivered in any language'. 3 
When placed together these arguments as to antiquity and 
language are said to create the most English and excellent of all 
systems oflaws. The English are more intelligent, of greater 'rank and 
distinction',4 than the continentals and in Littleton's language of 
withernams, formedons, essoines, recaptions, vouchers, seneschalls 
and the like 'our native common lawyers'S had forged a hermetic 
science as close to perfection, to true reason and God, as any on earth.

MEMORY, PRECEDENT AND WRITING SYSTEMS OF LAW 
The initial argument put forward by scholarly commentators such 
as Fulbecke and Fraunce, theologians such as Cardinal Pole and 
indeed Thomas More in his Utopia l and by Rastell in the introduction 
to his dictionary'l gains considerably in intensity when it comes to Ix: 
linked to the reformists' nationalistic advocacy of the vernacular. Law 
French was not simply the barbarous usage of an ominous guild of 
secular ordinaries, but its continued existence served to remind the 
inhabitants of the new commonwealth of the origin oflaw's mysteries 
in an earlier invasion and subjugation of the realm. The blight of 
lawyers imposed upon the realm was compounded by the fact that 
their pervasive laws were nO{ even English laws. For John Hare this 
surviving 'tincture of Normanism' was a mountainous dishonour, a 
cause of shame and grief, as though some strange hero 'who being 
captivated, and marked for a slave, should have his senses so 
captivated also, as to be more ambitious to be chambered in his jail, 
and to glitter in gilt fetters, rather than to be restored to his lost 
freedom and reputation'.3 A brief glance at the laws was enough to 
show that they 'still scorn to speak otherwise, than in the conque:-or's 
language, and are for the most part, his introductions, shutting up the 
remaining liberties of our nation ... as if we were no further to be 
accounted free, than infranchised· ... Others attacked the foreign 'ink-
pot' terms of the voces vt1Ialts;~ the 'petty-fogging' Norman mentality, 
inJohn Warr's view, ensnared but did not remedy the people's ills. 
Law was the greatest of the commonwealth's wounds and of itself a 
sin for which only a 'reformation ofthe laws of England' could atone.6

Dogma and Heterodoxy: Language and the English Way 
In a discussion of the temporal abuses of the clergy, Saint German 
remarks that 'as long as the spiritual rulers will pretend, that their 
authority is so high, and so immediatdy derived from God, that the 
people are bound to obey them, without argument or resistance, then 
so long the light of grace will not appear'.' The argument that the 
spirituality refuses to listen to criticism but rather denounces it in an 
oracular fashion is given a further twist when Saint German observes 
that 'if [prelates 1 preach heresy ... it is certain, that they would look 
to be believed . .. for they would say, they were no heresies that they 
preached'. :.! Doctrine, in other words, though it may change, is always 
true as stated by the requisite authorities (sources) and must be 
obeyed. The key to understanding the authority of the spiritualjudges 
is equally the key to understanding of temporal profession. The 
. doctrinal defence of English law against the profusion of criticisms 
. listed adopts a comparable strategy to the theologian's defence of the 
established faith and its clerical and ecclesiastical officiate. 
The primary secular exponent of doctrinal apologetics is un~ 
doubtedly Coke, who manages in one body in one lifetime to defend 
the common law against foreigners, against scholars and against 
multiple forms of popular criticism. Criticism from any quarter is for 
Coke an undesirable attribute, and we might begin our account of this 
"theology of English law by turning to that point in the RtpOrls where he 
most strongly adopts the argument from the necessary authority of 
doctrine in relation to a newly founded Anglicanism, asserting that 
those who resort to Roman ways or who: 
bring over those books oflate wriuen ... from Rome or the Romanist" 
or read them and justify them ... tun into d~sperate dangers and 
downfalls; for the first offence is a prtumunirt, which is to ~ adjudged 
outside the King's protection, to lose all their lands and goods, and to 
suffer perpetual imprisonment; and they that offend the second time 
therin incur the heavy danger of high treason.3

MEMORY, PRECEDENT AND WRITING SYSTEMS OF LAW 
who studicd at the Inlls of Court would at some point have 
rhetoric in its Ciceronian and so forensic aspects. The first sclholarly 
works to attempt to present an account of the form of law as 
argumentation were curricula rhetorical manuals. Works such as 
those of Cox (1,3°), Wilson (15,3), Rainolde (1563), Sydney·( 1580) 
and Puttcnham (1589) devoted extensive attention to law and to legal 
examples and, although they tended towards a formulary treatment 
of their subject, there are two senses in which their work may be 
adduced in relation to the emergent jurisprudence at a conceptual as 
opposed to a purely institutional level. The first is in terms ofa poetic 
or rhetorical contract at the origin ofthe social and hence legal form, a 
theory of speech as logos which becomes incorporated into the 
dialectical conception of notation and at a more abstract level is 
repeated in the primary motive force of Ramist jurisprudence, the 
search for the imposition of a linguistic order upon the positive 
manifestations of a higher law. The second is in terms of topics or 
commonplaces of legal argument, organised according to criteria 
drawn from the rhetorical art of memory and subsequently and 
ironically developed in an explicit form in thejurisprudential account 
of method. 
The initial demand was simply that lawyers and their schools of 
manners at the Inns ofeourt did not sever all links with scholarship. 
For Cox, 'judicial oratory belongs to controversies in the law and 
pleas, which kind of oration in time past belonged only to judges and 
men oflaw but now for the greater part it is neglected by them though 
there is nOlhing more necessary than to quicken them in crafty and 
wise handling of their matters'.! Such criticism is echoed and 
expanded in later works on the basis of both historical and conceptual 
lineages. In' terms of its practice. law was the art of pleading and of 
arguing a cause. By virtue of that subject matter it was, and had 
always been, intrinsically linked to rhetofic: it was impossible either 
to plead or to argue skilfully without the aid of the art that set out and

explained the appropriate forms of all argumentation. That rhetoric 
was essential to law was indisputable. What occasioned concern was 
that the rhetoric employed was so frequently bad rhetoric. In such a 
fashion Puttenham argues that 'in all deliberations of importance 
where counsellors are allowed freely to opine and show their conceits, 
a good persuasion is no less requisite than speech itselr .J Good 
persuasion was impossible without a knowledge of the figures and 
order of speech. What was wrong with law was simply the appalling 
state of the rhetorical art in legal practice, a point which Wilson and 
Puttenha~, both of whom were members of the Inns of Court, labour 
to the extreme. Pleadings were ambiguous,2 narrations disordered,3 
figures inappropriate,· language 'inkhorn' and 'powdered' /1 style 
. opaque and topics unseemly.6 The consequence was that poor 
lawyering led to clients losing their possessions and their lives and the 
commonwealth was in consequence endangered. 7 
Rhetorical concern for the decay oflegal argument was predicated 
not simply upon the immediate harm that was caused by legal 
ineptitude but more profoundly upon a notion of linguistic contract. 
. To abuse language was a sin both against the order of disciplines and 
also against the linguistic fabric of social life. In an argument that in 
this instance stems alternately from the myth of Hegesias8 and from 
Cicero's De inventione,9 the original ground of language was poetry.

rather the carrier of 'revealed', sacramental meanings that move in 
mysterious ways,· Finally, the idiosyncracy of law French, in 
comparative terms at least. requires a theory of national particularily 
whereby the oddity of legal language is explained by the privilege of· 
national character and by its proximity to God. The arguments will 
be outlined in turn. 
The attribution of authority to English law initially takes a 
conceptual form in the civilian manner. All of the authors under · 
discussion are agreed that positive law has its origin in God's law, 
Saint German is the most explicit. Positive law is based upon law 
eternal) law of reason and law ofGod ~ it is 'a true sign constituted by 
human tradition and authority . . . with a view to some spiritual or 
temporal end consonant with rcason [and] with the law of God'.2 
Fortescue likewise asserts the filial fear of God as the necessity 
underlying the study aflaw. Human laws are sacred and their scienc~ 
or profession is the art of what is good and equal, while those who 
administer the law, 'who sit and preside in the courts ofjustic:e, are 
therefore not improperly, called saurdOltS {being one who gives or 
teaches Holy things)'.3 The genealogy of customary Jaw rtnd~rs 
arguments as to their antiquity in a different light. The assertion of 
the fact that English law is the very oldest and very best is only 
incidentally an historical argument. It is primarily a doctrinal 
notation of laws that are variously described by Fortescue as solemn, 
magnificent, exceeding valuable, excellent, sublime and 'superior to 
the civil law in that [they J accord more closely to the scriptures and 
the writings of the Church fathers'.4 They are dispensed by 
who appear publicly for only three hours on Diu juridicOJ

This patristic presentation of customary law gains its most explicit 
lormlllallo,n in Davies' Primtr Rtport. It is law most perfect. and most 
r .. :ce.lle,,,t, and without comparison the best: 
(A]s the law of nature, which the schoolmen do call ius communi, and 
which is also ius non scriptum bdng written only in the hearts of men, is 
better than all written laws ... so th~ customary law of England, which 
we do likewise call ilLS communt as coming nearest to the law of nature, 
which is the root and touchstone of all good laws, and which is also ius non 
scriptum, [is] written only in the memory of man. I 
time out of mind in the collective memory of the legal 
,pr,ofe.ssi"n, customary law is sanctioned, protected l transmitted 
~h,rou,gh the ages and finally delivered by a tradition of the unwriltcn 
'for the common law of England is a Tradition and learned by 
as well as by Books'. Even where there were records or 
,wt'jting,s, these were no more than affirmations of existent law, 'for 
reports are but comOlents or interpretations upon the 
common law: which Text was nevl~ r originally written, but 
ever been preserved in the Olemory of men, though no man's 
can reach to the original thereof'.:! It is precisely because 
ilradition precedes scripture within the apparently Catholic profes-
of the law that when writing is referred to it must be understood 
a sign, as bearing the authority of its author and source, and the 
fm,earlings of the speech from whence it came. It is in consequence no 
writing but rather a mixture of senses literal, allegorical, 
,iil)lStcocj()US and other. Once the primary position of tradition is settled 
the institution and itS bearers put in their proper place - they are 
'true and honest men' who guard the historical faith and 
CxlllSecr:.teits texts so as to reveal the substance of their words - then it 
occasion no surprise to find that the language and even the 
of the law will appear strange to the common or unlearned eye.

concern with argumentation and the accessibility of the 
knowledges to their national audiences was similarly based upon 
form of anamnesis or of knowledge as recollection of the 
existent natural order. The utility of argument was not, th,m:fOlce, 
that of analysing what it meant to think and to argue, but rather 
of organising and dividing the categories of thought to reflect the 
established order of their object. l In that important respect 
rhetorical schemata must be understood as having a seeon,d-e.r(j,:r 
status: the criticism of the legal institution was of its deviation 
distance from an original bond between word and meaning. while 
positive task of the rhetorical method was that oflpre.vi,ji"'g IJeelag;ogic 
rules whereby the relevant topics and appn)PI'iaite 
inculcated and remembered. 
In broader genealogical terms, rhetoric thus took its place 
an order of discourse concerned to remember and defend a Drl.m"rv 
knowledge. Superimposed upon that fundamentally 
enterprise, rhetoric came closest to being legitimately regarded 
jurisprudential discipline by virtue of both its object and 
techniques. It had the advantage of being a classical art. One 
three parts was specifically concerned with the legal genre 
argumentation. As the study of discourse, it comprehended the 
disciplines that might be deemed relevant to law, most notal,ly' 
history, politics, logic and the nascent philology. It was not simply a. 
learned art, but also and crucially a technique that was concerned 
directly with questions of practice and the spoken word. In 
context it had a further virtue of inestimable value to the 
profession:. it provided a practical 1001 that would enable lawyers to. 
Such a point, of course, holds true of all the pre-Cartesian disciplines.

· The Ramists may have changed the name of their preferred art from

In an era that had treated Aristotle as something of a sacred

Abraham Fraunce attended at Cambridge and it was to rhetoric and 
poetics that the bulk of his non~legal writings were devoted. Ifwe now 
lurn to examine legal Ramism as a collective phenomenon, as a 
movement towards establishing a particular form of educational 
curriculum at the Inns of Court, it is rapidly apparent that Fraunce's

critique of the contemporary legal curriculum were somewhat 
exceptional. His failure was. however. matched by the lesser failures

provenance and its modernism, it was simply as a language of

of the dogmatic eulogy of Englishness and common law.

simply the purest of all legal scienccs but also the queen of

for Davies lux in tentbris, light in our darkness, and the oracle of justice, . 
for 'doth she (our law] not registcr and keep in memory the best of our

and perhaps more surprisingly, 'lastly, is not the professor of law a 
star in the firmament of the commonwealth? Is nol his house as it were 
an oracle, not only to a town or city, but to a country?'! Vnsur-
prisingly, criticism of the profession has transpired to be mistaken, 
vulgar and ignorant. Coke would not bother to 'sharpen the nib of my 
pen' against the critics of his histories or of Littleton, 'a work of as , 
absolute perfection in its kind, and as free of error, as any book that I 
have known written of any human learning'.2 In institutional terms, 
the profession also stands between justice, 'lady and queen of all 
moral virtues', and barbarism. Without the interpreters) in other

Law and Scholarship: Critical Commentaries and Lost Texts 
The most remarkable feature of the doctrinal defence of law was its 
limited scholarship. Perhaps, like the most effective rhetOric, it was 
strikingly simple. not least because it stood sure of the centrality of the 
profession to the political development of the modern state. What is 
clear, however, is that as a genre of legal writing it did not greatly 
impress scholars either within or without the profession. 4 In addition 
to tracing the explicitly polemical elaboration ofa native tradition, it

further necessary to account for the relationship of jurisprudence to 
growth of the vernacular disciplines and to the sixteenth·century 
;re'lai,.saloee oflearning in general. The differentiating feature ofthe 
scholarly jurisprudential literature was, as was seen most 
and exceptionally in the work of Frau nee, a desire to provide a 
of law as a discipline, a theory that would defend the legal 
against the popular criticism of legal dunsmen and their 
:botdlp<lt study as well as against the more academic criticism of a 
oflearning that lacked a classical order and book. Iflaw was to 
properly presented as a reformed vernacular learning and as an 
created through a revitalised national scholarship, then its 
deficiency in comparison to the other disciplines was the 
[abse"ee of a disciplinary text, an Aristotle, Euclid or Galen, I or in 
terms a Gaius or Justinian. a Bude or Badollin. The Ramist 
with method and with the specific differentiating features of 
of the disciplines within the greater order of the sciences was an 
though by no means exclusive, source for the emergence of a 
conception oflegal studies. For all the elements of vitriol and

briefly outlining the more significant claims to method that the 
Ramists made. 
From the Rule of Reason to the Letters of Law 
The sources and the extent of Ram ism in sixteenth-century En'gl;lnd 
were hotly disputed at the time and remain somewhat unclear. 
was already, most notably in Wilson's Rule oj ReaJon and Lever's 
oj Reason, Rightly Termed Witcraji, a vernacular tradition of logic 
the former work paid not inconsiderable attention to 
(methodus).l Exempting the two vernacular translations of 
dialectique by Macllmaine and Dudley Fenner, it should also be 
that for all the scholastic vitriol aimed at the critics oflhe AristoDtelian: 
tradition the new school of logic was concerned with changes 
emphasis rather than substance and that it was distinctly critical in 
reception of Ramism.2 Leaving points of detail aside, the most 
can be said is that the Ramists .introduced a virulently reformist style ' 
to the study of logic which, largely in response to the new technology 
of print, demanded a presentation of the vernacular discipline in 
manner that could be seen to be ordered and discrete. It endeavoured 
not to change the substance of the discipline but rather to order its 
subject matter in a didactic and memorable way: 'the " Ramist man'" 
must smash the images both within and without, must substitute for 
the old idolatrous art the new image· less way of remembering 
through abstract dialectical order'. 3 
In rhetorical terms, the Ramists were concerned to introduce 
English law and English lawyers to a new age of learning, 
renaissance of the discipline based upon a critical reception 
continental philosophy and upon a reworking of the order 
disciplines. There was no reason why lawyers or law should fall . 
behind in the reception of new learning. and indeed law might ; 
appropriately lead the renewal of classical learning. Both Doderidge 
and Fulbecke acknowledge that contemporary lawyers have bet':n

jUl"ifiably criticised and eyen ridiculed for their lack of scholarship in 
..ne."al. and further for their sparsity of learning even within their 
discipline. Fulbccke interestingly details such criticisms in terms 
a 'science void of all proper definitions. artificial divisions and 
reasons', while for Doderidge lawyers are open principally to 
criticism that they lack any conception of the place of law within 
lea.rniing in general. The gem:ric and political function of method is 
:.th,:rdor< that of reintroducing law to its proper civic and discursive 
:.cont<:xt" Knowledge is a question of dialogue between disciplines and, 
looks deep enough, historically and conceptually, then within 
law can be traced the marks of all the disciplines. Henry Finch, in 
.·a tre'lu,:ntly cited passage, thus discusses legal reason as coming 'out 
the best and very bowels of divinity, grammar, logic; also from 
:ptlilo'solpn:y, natural, moral, political, economic, though in our year 
books they come not under the same terms, yet the things which there 
. you find arc the same; for the sparks of all sciences in the world are 
: raked up in th< ashes of th< law',' Th< whol< of th< first book of 
' Finch's Law is thus taken up with outlining the appropriate 
· disciplines from which the place logic oflaw should draw its topics, its 
· arguments. These include those listed, with the significant addition of 
interpretation, 'law constructions natural', and fictions or. 'law 
constructions feigned' as further sources of law or places of legal 
Doderidge too offers the advice that the law, as the 
:,klllo,,'leclge of all things divine and human, 'comprises all other 
and that therefore the professor of law 'should be 
furnished with the knowledge of all good. literature of most of the 
j.,sci<nc<sliberal; for ... a man may observe the use of those sciences to 
'. lie hidden in the law'. While Doderidge does not provide such an 
, extensive or meticulously detailed list of relevant disciplines and 
learnings as Finch, his discussion of the sources of common law does 
spell out the argument that natural and moral philosophy are direct 
:- sources oflaw 'from whence, as from a fountain, all laws do flow? and 
also includes the civil and canon laws as being parts of the law of 
':' nature and so also grounds of common law, 
The generic context of legal knowledge, and most particularly of 
' the logic of law, is that of discourse as such. Doderidge repeats at 
· several points the claim that it is dialogue that founds learning and 
equally that both the arts and the sciences are but forms of discourse,

MEMORY, PRECEDENT AND WRITING SYSTEMS OF LAW 
bond upon which all social order rested. In its strongest form, as 
presented by Puttenham, poetry creates and describes the social" 
world through the use of images. Withoul the creative power of poetic 
language, sodety would never have been formed, knowledge would 
have: been impossible and law irrelevant: 'The profession and use of 
poetry is most ancient from the beginning, and not as many 
erroneously suppose, after, but before any civil society was among. 
men. For it is written that poetry was the original cause and occasion 
of tht:ir first assemblies.'1 Observing that the speech of God was 
originally presented in metrical forms, Puttcnham elaborates 
classical histories in which the first instances of aU forms of 
knowledge, the first priests, oracles, seers (vidmltS) , politicians and 
lawyers were all poets. Using the terminology of rhetoric and contract 
rather than that of poetics, the same theme is pervasive in Wilson's 
Arlt: only by virtue of eloquence, the 'gift of utterance' I was the state of : 
nature transformed inlo that of civil society, such is 'the force of the 
tongue and such is the power ofe1oquence and reason, that most men 
are forced even to yield in that which most stands against their will' .2 
It is thus in a discussion of the second part of rhetoric, namely 
disposition, that Wilson specifies the linguistic basis of all law in 
terms of proper and proportionate - rational- speech: 'I know that all 
things stand by order and without order nothing can be. For by an 
order we are born, by an order we live, and by an order we make our 
end. By an order one ruleth as head and others obey as members. By 
an order realms stand and laws take their force. '3 
The order to which Wilson attributes such primordial force is a 
rhetorical or argumentative one based upon the appropriate usc and 
disposition ofehe figures and topics of the genres of speech. Without 
that intrinsically poetic order, laws would lose their force and 
governments would fall into disrepute.4 In terms of the forensic art, 
this emphasis was spelled out in the demand that lawyers accept the 
originary linguistic mediation of all law and observe the appropriate 
forms of argument and proof. Although elements of emphasis vary as

the formulary and the Ciceronian rhetorical schemes, a

of the classics.] The new national rhetorics were to pay

other traditions. Had their work been taken seriously in its political 
dimensions, the standard of legal scholarship could only have bern 
improved by recourse to pre~epts drawn from an array of disciplines 
other than law. For Fulbecke, the various types oflaw, namely the law 
of nature, cfoations, the civil law, common law, customary law and 
equity all required argumentation in terms of very different disci-
plines and topics. 2 In that law should aspire through method to the 
status of reasoned discourse, it must make use of the learning relevant 
to the reasoning of any subject matter dealt with by legal argument, 
which includes, on even the most obvious counts, theology, natural 
and moral philosophy, politics, economics, history, rhetoric and 
grammar. In more classical terms, the accepted definition of law, 
repeated several times in Doderidge's Engish Lawyer, was iuris prudentia 
est divinarum humanarumque rerum scientia, knowledge of things both 
divine and human. The study of law was therefore, in Doderidge's 
terms at least, to be understood as both a speculative and a practical 
knowledge. In its speculative aspect, jurisprudence was to be the 
discourse that 'treats of the principles, groundwrules and originals of 
law and justice, being the chain of human society, without which it 
cannot consist'. In more pragmatic terms, speculative reason alone 
could 'purge English laws from the great confusions, tedious super-
fluous iterations, with which the reports are infested; [and] quit it of 
these manifold contrarieties, wherewith it is so greatly overcharged'.l 
With the exception of Finch's Law, which provides a critical 
institutional account of tht: major divisions of English law specified in 
terms of possessions, wrongs and actions,\! the exclusive focus of the 
jurisprudential literature was legal reasoning, understood as the 
dis(ourse oflaw. Lodged historically at the point of intersection ofa 
predominantly oral tradition and a new technology ofprint,jurispru-
dence grappled to provide an account oflegal reason that would order 
an increasingly visible and contested literature, according to the 
intrinsic precepts of a vernacular or national hermeneutic. In doing

Doderidge, English Lawyer, pp. 258-g; see also pp. 33-5, where the same 
argument is put forward in terms of the need for lawyers to study civil law and to 
be furnished with the knowledge 'of all good literature of most of the sciences 
liberal'. The view is repeated in relation to the division of topics at pp. 155-61. 
2 The first book of the Law takes the form of a rhetorical place logic in which 
canons, maxims and rules (positive grounds) of the common law are explained 
and exemplified. The topics examined are drawn from all the disciplines of 
learning and the appropriate forms oflogical argumentation are set out. Books 2-
4 set out the divisions of substantive law according to Ramist principles. 
The Eucharist and English Law 
105 
so, the Ramists relied increasingly upon a veridical notion oflanguage 
and upon a correlative conception of the truth oflaw as a sign of sacral 
depths. Fulbecke, for instance, presents the eminently practical view 
that 'the reason and conscience of the lawyer is not simply a question 
of the knowledge he has by the written law [for] when words are 
obscure ... we imagine that. more was spoken than written, and more 
intended than uttered ... then the tongue yieldeth to the heart, and 
the words do give place to the meaning'. 1 In including this account of 
the rule of reason as it came to law, a number of themes can be drawn 
together by pointing to the fateful implications of Fulbecke's reinvo· 
cation of the tradition that precedes the word or of the Church that 
comes before the gospel. 
For all the popular appeal and polemical value of the call to method 
and modernity, the superficial banner under which legal reason 
emerged as an independent domain of study should not blind 
historiography to the substance of its claims. In positive terms, the 
study of invention and judgment in law drew upon and expanded the 
scholastic rhetorical tradition of place logics or topics into a discursive 
theory oflegal argumentation or dialectic. Principally concerned with 
the reasoning of legal argumentation, dialectic insisted on the 
probable character of the genre and in subordinating probable topics 
to reason allowed space for disciplines other than common law. The 
negative aspect of Ramism as a polemic in favour of method and 
doctrine was, however, always likely to be more amenable to the 
institutional and political needs of the profession. In its polemical 
guise, Ramism privileged dogmatics and gave pride of place to a 
purely custodial art of memory. Method organised the subject matter 
of any given discipline to the end of teaching and transmitting a series 
of dogmatic truths. If, as was subsequently to happen, the doctrinal 
aspect of Ramism was taken at face value, then jurisprudence could 
become what the ecclesiastics termed an historical as opposed to a 
feeling or 'lived' faith. As in theology, so also in law, tradition could be 
invoked as the guardian of an originary and unwritten word, and as 
the institutional custodian of a linguistic contract that now pre-
existed memory and could be recollected only through the oracular 
pronouncements of professional dogmatics. 
The argument from tradition to a notion of the special status of the 
legal word as a sign, as a secular sacrament, is not directly available in 
Fraunce's work. Its derivation can, however, be traced to an

comfortable lights and prospects toward the beautifying of this ancient 
palace, that has hitherto been ... but dark and melancholy.l 
The Ramist Fulbecke interestingly confirms both of Cowell's under-
stated proposals, noting first, in terms of historical influence, that 'the ' 
common law cannot otherwise be divided from the civil and canon · 
laws than the flower from the root and stalk' and second, in terms 
method, exclaiming 'would that God would vouchsafe our Inns 
Court with some second Budaeus, that is a third Varro) whose skill in 
the laws might Ix exquisite, whose pains extreme, whose reward 
excellent'.2 In both instances, however, the invocation of Roman 
influence and metnods was somewhat too explicit and direct lor an 
embattled profession that waS concerned to save its native history and 
to propound its national excellence. If there was to ~ a foreign 
influence, it had to be secondary and covert, subordinate to the 
polemically necessary exposition of a fully indigenous schola 
and its peculiar yet vernacular language. Even in 
thoroughly Ramistic logic, The English Lawyer, we find his 
recognition of civil law as a source of English law qualified by 
crucial observation that 'those foreign [i.e. Roman] know ledges, 
not inherent or inbred in the laws but rather a borrowed light 
found there but rather brought thither and learned elsewhere by 
that have adorned and polished the studies of the lawes'.

unwritten meanings can properly determine whether or not the text 
to be taken in its 'plain signification' or whether it is rather to be 
understood in an esoteric sense that accords more accurately with the 
hidden and immemorial reason of the oldest and most excellent of all , 
laws. Finch provides the final and most explicit designation: positive 
laws are framed in the light of natural law and reason 'and from 
thence come the grounds and maxims of all common law, for that 
which we call common law, is not a word new and 
barbarous ... but the right term for all other laws'.! 
Excursus 
A genealogical study cannot claim to attribute causes, nor can it 
legitimately provide general conclusions that would somehow link the 
discontinuities studied to an explanation of their contemporary 
institution. Insofar, however, as genealogical analysis is the study of 
figures of descent, of the contingent affiliations and alien sources, the 
inessential qualities of emergence of specific textual communities, it 
raises properly hermeneutic issues. Those questions relate to the 
specific form of the legal textual community and the metaphysics of 
belonging to it or speaking for it. Hermeneutics is equally the study of 
tradition and, insofar as that textual community is 'our' tradition, 
that metaphysics will playa part in defining who 'we' are. 2 Even 
restricting analysis to the concepts of origin, essence, truth and 
transmission present in the earliest printed jurisprudential literature, 
we may none the less recognise a hermeneutic over which we still 
fight, a tradition of which we are still - however uneasily - the 
incumbents. I will end by simply listing certain of the more striking or 
inescapable features of that tradition, of that distance and those dark 
letters that arc law for us. 
I Origin and otherness. The first principle of legal community is 
theocratic. It is the attribution of an originary status and authority to 
the speech of the law. Legal discourse and the texts through which it

gains its positive formulations are simple representations of a primary 
speech that pre-exists and authorises the legal textual community. 
. That origin is hidden, distant and dark. It is the logos, the source or 
. ·oracle oflaw which our authors variously name as God, nat,ure, time 
immemorial or that even more peculiarly English phenomenon, the 
unwritten constitution. Just as the constitution binds invisibly - it is 
simply 'how things are' - so the discourse of law remembers and 
repeats an ideal th;1.t is ever elsewhere, an origin or absolute other into 
whose face we may never look, whose back is ever turned towards us. 
In more contemporary terms, we may note jurisprudential 
preferences for sources rather than arguments or dialogues, for 
validity rather than value, for judgment rather than justification or 
accountability as the authenticating marks of juridical speech. 
2 Essence and absence. Origin connotes essence as the survival of that 
quality which was first and which forms the basis of tradition. 
Tradition is the custody of that which is already there and its essence 
is expressed in the separation of spirit from substance. Legal 
hermeneutics thus distinguishes the material form or letter from the 
spirit of the text or the unwritten tradition by which doctrine alone 
may name the values and meanings of the text. The spiritual 
orientation of legal interpretation continuously subordinates the 
material qualities of tradition - the words, the texts, the notations as 
profane objects - to the search for their hidden meanings or essence: 
an essence that is always understood to be external, disembodied, an 
object of recuperation rather than of habit or oflived existence. Where 
it is a question of essence, then ceremony and ritual, theatrical 
framing and other emblems and insignia .of the absolute (of that 
which is absent) are of greater importance than the simple materials 
of language. A language which consecrates is of interest only for that 
to which is refers. 
3 Truth and faith. Tradition is predicated upon a notion of 
recollections ofidentificatory essences; through tradition we belong to 
communities. To belong is in some measure to be faithful to the creed. 
In legal terms, faith is faith in the origin, fidelity to the source of which 
the note or sign is the mere representation. To be lawful is to be true, 
by which enigma we may understand that truth is the faithful 
recollection of the message, the representation of the content of 
tradition in its· own peculiar symbolic language. Literalism as a 
technique onegal hermeneutics has its place at this point in tradition: 
the legal sign may be taken literally, we may believe in the instrument

the forms of discourse being the very instruments of knowledge: sed 
scienda instrumenta sunt format discenderi. 1 When it comes to the logic of 
law we thus find this most basic underpinning of the method oflegal 
science is itself. properly speaking, rhetorical. Logic is defined as the 
art of right definition and division; it is also the art of proper 
argumentation: dialectica est recla difmiendi, dividendi, et argumentandi aTS. 
When it came, however, to the order of 'artificial' reasoning of what 
Fraunce had termed 'the school at Westminster', it is a specific . 
conception oflogic, a discute logic oflaw I that is stressed despite the 
morc general advocacy of the plurality afknowledges relevant to law, 
In Doderidge (he reader is treated to the exposition ofthcjudgment in 
Shtllits Case in the form of a syllogism and also to constant reiteration 
of the axiomatic character of legal precedents, legal maxims and the 
grounds of law in general. If we turn to Fulbecke it is also easy to see 
an element of defensiveness bordering the exposition of a logic oflaw. 
In the final analysis, the logic oflaw is based upon natural reason and 
unwritten tradition lodged in the communis opinio of the legal profes-
sion. In terms that extend but do not greatly differ from comparable 
definitions in Doderidge and in Finch, we thus find Fulbecke 
depicting the lawyer as an administrator of sacral customs and of 
unwritten truths, authorities to which he has access by virtue of the 
fact that 'both the lawyer andjudge are the ministers and dispensers 
of just icc, and of the gifts of God, and arc servants to God himself. 
With regard to the 'unprecedented' introduction oflogic to law, it is 
impossible not to conclude that the eventual effect of Ram ism and of 
dialectical method more generally was that of placing logic in the 
service of authority and memory in the hands of the institution. The 
order of memory spelled out by Doderidge distinguished between 
memory and reminiscence, between actus mtmorandi and actus 
rtminiscendi. The former, upon which method is based, represel).ts the 
past as if it were present, 'representing the image of the · thing 
forepassed in the same manner as if they were now actually and really 
present' ,2 Where actus rtminisctndi was the discourse of memory and 
contained the possibility of discovery, criticism and the mixing of 
genres, the actus mtmorandi simply dictated the truths ofa traditiun, of 
that which was already established and in need of no further 
justification. Thus, for Fulbecke, ' the end and effecl oflaw is to settle 
the property and right of things in them to whom they belong'. What .

was made present through the memory, the axiomatic places oflegal 
logic, was an ancestral order, a hierarchy, a Church in the sense of an 
assembly in the Eucharistic presence of law. The point can be talten 
further in terms of the reception of Ramism in England. Where 
Fraunce had been wary of accepting the Ramist definition of a 
discipline, and particularly of its basis in received truths or in its own 
internal history, the less rigorous translation of Ramus' Logic tended 
towards the purely pedagogic. Th.e three fundamental precepts of any 
art are enthusiastically spelled out by MacJlmainc in the introduction 
to the first English translation of the Logic. The first is that each 
discipline must be elaborated solely in terms of its own subject-matter 
and to the exclusion of all extraneous cons·iderations; to write on law 
requires disavowing all considerations of grammar, divinity or 
physics, and if asked of contracts or obligations, it is a mockery of 
method to reply in terms ofliberty or bondage. I Each discipline is, in 
other words, wholly discrete; a premiss that we may observe flatly 
contradicts the broader claims oflaw to divine wisdom or, indeed, to 
any great learning whatsoever, The second precept is that method 
proceeds through teaching necessary truths, through transmitting the 
ordained and accepted wisdom of the subject. According to the third 
precept, this transmission should follow an order of dispositive clarity 
from general truths of the discipline to particular and less absolute 
truths by means of a procedure of definition and subsequent 
specification in terms of available topics. 
It takes little imagination to see that an uncritical version of 
Ramism could be of great service to Coke and others who wished to 
provide the mythologies of the legal institution with a veneer of 
scholarship. [n Fraunce's text, the rule of reason could have provided 
reasoned tools for rational discourse in the realm of law. For 
Doderidge, Finch and Fulbecke, such learning was also present in 
their work, in the range of their references to other disciplines and to

manifest its subjection to reason or at least to the rhetorical order of : 
probable argumentation. 
The dictionary was one of many works that attempted in this and 
other manners to systematise the English common law and to bring : 
some element of the sixteenth·century renaissance oflearning to bear . 
upon a burgeoning profession and its peculiar rhetorical, notarial and 
scriptural practices. In common with the other disciplines, the 
English legal tradition had to face the advent of printing and it was 
the elite scribal and notarial practices of the various tiers of the 
profession that became the object of the most extensive critical 
debate. Dr Cowell, the author of the Interpreter and professor of civil 
law at Cambridge, represented part of a vigorous but unsuccessful 
movement for the reform of English law through its subjection to 
some elements at least of comparative and critical historical method. 
In common with scholarly reformers on the continent such as 
Hotman, I Cowell's principal demand had been for the systematisa· . 
tion of common law and specifically of its various haphazard literary 
manifestations according to classically received civilian principles of 
philosophical, historical and rhetorical methocP In the event, the 
literary tradition that emerged in England lacked the breadth of 
scholarship, the range of reference, the order and rhetorical clarity, 
that Cowell and others had advocated. 
The predominantly literary tradition that found its way into 
licensed legal print was a dogmatic one. It was produced within the · 
profession, in the peculiar language of the profession, and was .

· circulated and stored almost exclusively amongst the various strata of 
the· legal instiwlion. Under very specific historical conditions and 
according to its own peculiar genealogy, the common law became a 
public system of written law. At the level of doctrine or ideology it 
· emerged as a legal icriturl or, to use the classical terminology, a system 
· oiwritten reason, a scripture. The dements of that English literary or 
, linguistic genealogy are complex and obscure. The present chapter 
aimlS to provide no more than a depiction of certain aspects of the 
sixteenth-century emergence of the lawyer as a distinctive class of 
I professional oracle and of lawyer's literature in particular as an 
exclusive and discrete genre. I will do so by examining three 
independent discourses concerned with the legal regulation of the 
inscription of social meaning, discourses that receive their first 
methodical or systematic treatment during the course of the sixteenth 
, century. The discourses arc [hose of armory, symbolacography and 
etymology, dealLI.1S respectively with the laws of composition of 
heraldic insignia, the rules oflegal writing and the lawful derivation 
or notation of words. In each instance, the most important questions 
to be raised concern the dialectic between law and philology. In the 
place of an oral tradition and its rhetorical art there emerges a 
linguistics of law and correlatively a Icgalisation of linguistics or, 
better, the juridical restraint of specific forms of inscription. I will 
begin with a brief consideration of the relation of an oral memory to 
literary forms, of speech to writing, of voice to print, and then move to 
consider the legal writing systems referred to above as examples of the 
textual linguistics of law. 
In each instance, the question to be raised is material as well as 
linguistic. The development of a fully textual system of law first 
incorporates a question of the storage and circulation of legal texts. 
How are these texts produced, where are these texts kept, by whom 
are they used, how do they move or circulate, who receives them, who 
interprets them, who would understand them, whose office is it to 
understand and to send on that understanding, to transmit that 
· custody? The specific material questions relating to the formulation of 
a legal archive, of a vast printed repository of law in the place of Ihe

argument as to language which Fraunce uses in the analysis of 
ddinitions. Under the heading of secondary argum(:nts is a lengthy 
analysis of notation or etymology, the interpretation of words 
according to their origins or, more accurately, their true and original 
meaning: elymologia, id tst, lJuiloquium.1 Fraunce's argument is the 
classical nominalist one that words are originally (by agreement) 
notes of things, and from all words either 'derivative or compound' 
arguments may be drawn and interpretations devised. Interpretation 
should agree with the name, a principle which Fraunce puts to 
interesting use in a lengthy analysis pf legal terms ranging from 
contract, to mortmain, to wapentake, mancipation and manumis-
sion. He concludes by arguing that 'I have properly inserted a 
number of notations, for that I would make it plain, how the notion of 
the thing is oftentimes expressed by the notation of the word, contrary 
to the prejudiced opinion of some silly penmen, and illogical lawyers, 
who think it a frultless point of superfluous -curiosity, to understand 
words of a man's own profession. '2 
In Doderidge3 the same argument i!i. put forward in relation to 
nominal d~finitions. However, it is no longer a secondary argument 
but a primary one: notation defines and explains the true signification 
and the effects of words, which are themselves but original signs of 
things." The notalions of a variety of Jegal words are then provided 
and the crucial significance oflanguagc to law is repeated by reference 
to the various different forms of language used ir. law proceedings, 
namely Latin, law Latin, neologisms from Saxon and French, and 
finally terms of art that were not known to the ancients. In 
endeavouring to explain the continued use of an archaic and arcane 
terminology, Doderidge puts forward two interesting propositions. 
The first is that all the arts were invented to further nature's operation 
through precepts. The precepts once put together form an art and 
such arts have devised 'many ways, by cypher, by counters and by 
Lawim fAgikl, fol. su, wh~re etymology is also defined as O"ginalio, quod 
origintm IItrborum expficel. For an earli ~r discussion in terms of the originally agreed 
meaning of signs, see Wilson, Rule oj Rtason, fol. 48a.

other fonns to assist nature'. The peculiar terminology and form of legal 
record ls justified as ·being such as 'serves to convey to fXJsterity our 
memorials and records and not our debate or speech'. 1 The link between 
an immemorial nature and artistic language is exemplified. secondly> by 
references to language as the content of law: 'if a record once say the 
word., no man shall aver; speak against it; or impugn the same. No 
though such record can Lain manifest and known falsehood.'2 
It is but a short step from the sanctity of records, of each letter and 
syllabic 'significant and known to the law', .to a conception of an 
original contract in which the unwriuen word was bestowed to the 
custody of tradition. The connection between an originary language 
and customary law is made initially by Fulb(~ck e, who refers to 'words 
of the law [which] may be compared to certain images called silmi 
Alcibiades, whose outward feature was deformed and uglYJ but within 
they were full ofjewcls and precious stones'.3 The theme is expanded 
in terms of the artificiality oflegal writing whose words 'the inventors 
of art have devised for acquainting the mind with the mysteries and 
rules of their art, because words fitly and aceomodately used, are the 
very images and representations of things which do lead, .. to the 
apprehension and perfect knowledge of the things themselves'." It 
need only be added that the inward meaning of legal signs and of an 
'image-serving' law was a question of authority and memory internal 
to the institution and unavailable to those without: rationtm u.hiqut 
habet sed non u.hique conspicuam,:' In Fulbecke's own words, 'speech is an 
external act, which is ordained for the declaration of inward meaning, 
and therefore words are said to be the limits of our meaning'.6

The Mixing of Oral and Literate Genres: Conversation and Law 
If the institutional writers of our English law consistently agree upon 
anyone thing, it is probably that Ihe most fundamental law within the 
common law system is unwritten. It is custom and precedent rather ' 
adhering, txyond the leiter of the written law {/,ienIJ, ifnot to something that tht 
law could not ignore,'

statute or code that marks and defines our national law. Above 
else, it is the antiquity of the native law that for Fortescue, Coke 
Davies, but also for Finch and Fulbccke, for Thomas Smith and 
Dr(~o'we!lI , guaramces its provenance in natural reason, its proximity 
God's will and consequently 10 natural law. The tradition, 
wh,"c'ver its modes of custody in plea rolls, in formularies, in the 
records and rcports, is none the less an oral tradition; it is 
in the ecclesiastical sense, an esoteric and authoritative 
,no,wl"d1:e handed on to the side of any manuscriptural or printed 
custody. In that sense, in the sense of the residually natural 
of common law, its antique inscription in the order of things 
,",:mmve,- in the human heart, in the legibility of natural forms-the 
,,,"rnITlOn law will always exceed its particular texts, its particular 
its positive forms. To know the law, to belong to the 
't.nmc,anvofthe sages and the sacred judges of the law, is a matter of 
In,,wiog an antique and unwritten tradition that exists outside of 
beyond all texts in the inaugural realm of things divine and to 
divined (augured). In Coke's words, even where it is a matter of 
re"dinothe law, it is a question of reading not simply the words of the 
but also the tradition that accompanies them: the text is a mere 
.reF,re"entation of an external memory; it is a vestige in the classical 
of vestigium, an imprint, a footprint, a mark or trace of 
i something, of some body, of some practice that passed on time out of 
or countless years ago, Where it is a question of reading, then it 
· is not the words but the truth that is to be adhered to: in leclione non 
'verba sed veritas est amanda. 1 
The customary basis of common law, the residually unwritten 
foundation of written law and so of all acts of interpretation, has the 
· curious consequence of illustrating the subordination of both speech 
· and writing, oral and written law, to a similar principle of fealty of 
meaning. Despite the differences in form, both genres of law respond 
a comparable exigency and are subject to a similar demand. They 
arc both systems of memory, traditions of precedent that use either 
their phonic or their graphic teslimonies to reconstruct and represent 
an imagined past, a past of events and practices whose origins have 
been lost, whose credentials arc presupposed, whose legitimacy is 
simply the product of collective faith (communis opinio) or latterly faith 
in the truth of texts (defide instrumenlorum) , They are both in that sense

tradition. Its literality is simply the product of its power to exclude all 
other contexts, all other interpretations. 
4 Transmission and diath. The art of legal hermeneutics is essentially 
epistolary. It is a question of constantly replenishing a veridical 
language and simultaneously reaffirming the lawfulness of the 
message. Were one forced to offer a conclusion as to the significance of 
the legal tradition, it would be in terms of a system of transmission, of 
messages and so oftexls} specialised writing systems or structures of

sion, then it would have to start with the question of texts and of the 
linguistics of legal texts. In terms of grammatology, of the study of 
systems of writing, the critique might well begin by questioning the 
limited pretensions of the legal profession. It may well be that th(" full 
aspiration of legal hermeneutics is no greater than that of putting a

Legal Writing Systems: 
Rhetoric, Grammatology and 
the Linguistic Injuries of Law 
Introduction 
The introduction to one of the earliest printed English law dic-
tionaries, the Interpreter, contains the following statement of general 
principle: 'And indeed a lawyer professes true philosophy, and 
therefore should not be ignorant (ifit were possible) of either beasts, 
fowls or creeping things, nor of the trees from the cedar in Lebanon to 
the hyssop that springs out of the wall.'l The dictionary is true to its 
declared principle. In addition to an extensive catalogue of technical 
legal items, of writs, offices and other terms 1 ranslated from law Latin, 
law French and middle English, may be found also entries concerned 
with philosophic, economic and critical su~ject matter, together with 
entries defining spices, herbs, plants and a variety of other non-legal 
terms encountered in legal texts. Entries range from a definition of 
mystery to words such a3 surplusage. wage, barrator; caraway seed} 
tunneric, pepper and cassia lignea; perche (a long pole) and pelota. 
In each instance, the logic of inclusion was comparable. The 
discreteness of the legal lexicon required the translation of any term 
that fell prey to the genre or was touched by the law. On the other 
hand, there was a duty implicit in the classical definition of law as 
'true p~ilosoph y' to account for the usages and discourse of the legal 
genre. It too should justify its place amongst the disciplines and so

tradition that is embedded in our very speech and of which 
speech, our phrases, are the unwitting witnesses. Law inthat 
our grammar, the rule of our speech. It is the trace or imprint of 
past in what we live and how we live, repossessed through iteration 
diction. It is tradition as the law that is lived, as habitual body 
daily routine, law as bond but also law as the trace ofdilTcrentiatiOtl 
itself, or in more secular terms the mark of a pre-given script. 
Derrida's terms, it would be the unwritten writing that precedes 
structures speech, the 'arche-writing', the trace, that which acts as 
imprint of an absolute past, a legal past, one beyond memory, 
which could never be 'reactivated or awakened to presence: 'The 
refers to an absolute past ... it obliges us to think a past that can 
longer be understood in the form of a modified presence, as a 
past'.2 Language is in grammatological terms always already 
by writing. For notation to be possible, language must already 
been cut, recut and remarked by law. It must have been di'l Tel:en,ce,d,: 
spaced, set out and its signs articulated prior to speech or any 
linguistic substance. Doderidge surprisingly reminds us that, 
the rhetoric of law may allow us to find a speech that resides' 
writing, a figuration and conversation within the text, we should 
be oblivious to the underside of that source of law, namely 
possibility of discovering a written law in oral representations.

ofroUs, tables and fines, is accompanied by a broader question of the 
science oflegal writing or grammatology of law. 1 It is that ofrelating 
questions oflanguage directly to issues oflaw: that is, to issues oftht 
legal institution and its texts. 
We are posing the question of a new genre ofliterature, of a printed 
archive oflegal forms. of printed reports, treatises and compendia of 
statutory laws and of procedural forms,'l and thereby we raise the 
question of the significance of this written form oflaw as it replaces the 
equally codified but materially distinct, predomi'1antly oral culture of 
the early common law. For grammatoLogy, the key question is 
precisely that of the form oflaw: a science oflegal writing will look at 
law specifically as writing; it will define law by its opus, its work which 
is a body of writing, a specialliu::rary genre or species orwriting that 
would have to be placed close - in the order of genres - to drama on 
the one hand and to the epic on the other. As such, a task is 
prescribed, one which Derrida defines in terms of an affair ofform. It 
will be that of studying 
the [legal] text in its formal structure, its rhetorical organisation, the 
specificity and diversity of its textual types, its modeLs of exposition and 
production - beyond what were once called genres - and, further, the 
space of its stagings (miststn scints) and its syntax, which is not just the 
articulation of its signifieds and its references to being or to truth but also 
the disposition of its procedures and everything invested in them. In 
short, to consider [law] as "a particular literary genre", which draws 
upon the reserves of a linguistic system, organizing, forcing, or diverting 
a set oftropological possibilities that are older than [law] itself.s

That repetition is a matter of memory to be sure, but it is also in law

or literal form: to know the law is not to know the words of the law, but 
. the force and property of the words.2 The textual culture of law, 
indeed, brings with it an explicit linguistics, a linguistics of fidelity to 
sources, to originals, to supposed first usages and all that those usages 
implied. We will pose, therefore, the additional question of what law

rules and procedures were most immediately recognisable as 
of authority, of a system of arcane citations and repetitions, 
epistolary art conducted in a strange tongue 'as thought the law 
written to str~ngers'l or, perhaps, more simply, to the Other. 
A third theme concerns an antagonism. In classical rh,"oroica 
terms there is no legitimate reason for supposing that law ought 
addressed outside of the legal institution. In terms oflanguage, 
audience and receipt, the circulation oflegal texts can be underst,ooel 
as a matter internal to the various tiers of the legal profession. 
are, of course, strong grounds of a doctrinal, sociological and politi.c.I' 
order for objecting to such a bureaucratic restriction of the 
materials of civil disposition and penal government. There is, at 
a cont.-adiction betwc:en the universal application of law 0'- ' rule 
law' and the rhetorical restrictions placed upon the availability and 
circulation of its texts. In grammatological terms, an additional 
question may thus be posed relating to the notational structure 
legal writing systems and particularly with regard to the restricted 
rhetorical play of their eventual dissemination. The first codified 
systems oflcgal notation governed armory, instruments and records. 
In linguistic terms, they share a common theme: each notational 
system is legalistically regulated by a theory of origins and is 
semantically structured so as to resuict meaning to an imputed 
originary form. The legal note - whether emblem, ensign, enigma, 
instrument, syllable or word - was to be a note bonded to a singular : 
and original referent. The legal use of signs was everywhere 
recognisable for its assertion of the canonic status of the first notation " 
and for coincident theories of fidelity and custody of the original and 
lawful meaning. 
Returning to (he question of the rhetoric of writing, we may observe 
the inexorable subordination of rhetoric (0 law. The techniques 
. 
legal writing to be examined constitute a series of parallel systems oC: 
linguistic and graphic restraint based primarily uptJn classical 
etymologies and 'true' notations. The question of meaning was dealt 
with in terms of fealty or faith. Meaning was everywhere. already 
decided, dogmatically determined in advance and so destined to 
immobility or semantic death. It is that principle of the death of 
meaning, or of the destruction of the sociality of meaning in favour of

"olher insignia of honour or 'generosity', were all subject to a series of 
legal regulations governing authorisation and the status of their 
bearers. The art was also subject to strict rules governing composition 
and content, inclusive of rules regulating the types of representation 
and of figuration that were perm in cd in relation to different statuses 
of honour and their symbolic representation. Thus, to take one 
example, the ;body', which is to say the image of a device, should

t~chniques or disciplines of faith as well as m~mory; as the: judges 
constantly state, we no longer know why the law is as it is, but we are 
none the less certain that it is the Jaw and that it is the best of all 
possible laws. It is in the first instance a rhetorical art and an 
oratorical practice. While it is futile to ignore the sense in which a 
spoken or non· literate language system is always already marked by 
writing - that is, by law and by the code that identifies its units, its 
syntax, its dictionary of meanings, its forms of repetition I - we may 
still also note the sense in which speech or a spoken form nevertheless 
determines the rdation of the written to the life world. In the most 
general of senses, there is no application of a written text without , 
some moment or modality of enunciation; what is written, in other 
words, will only ever appear in the present, in the event or in 
judgment through a reading or through some mechanism of oral 
delivery, of phonic application to a place and a person.2 We must still 
ask of the text, who speaks this law? 
The rhetorical question of the form of customary laws is well posed 
by Sir John Doderidgc. In discussing the sources of common law, ' 
Doderidge makes explicit a point that is somewhat veiled in other 
authors of the same generation. The general definition of customary 
law is that it is a matter of use and of prescription based upon use . . 
Cowell in the Inttrprtter offers the following definition: 'custom is" law 
or right not written, which being established by long use and the 
consent of our ancestors, has been and is daily practised'. The 
elements are age, usage and recognition or prescription based upon 
the former attributes, Interestingly, the- slightly earlier dictionary by 
Rastell, Tht Exposici,ms of Ihe TtmlJ of lht Laws oj Erlgland, defines 
custom as a writ whi,:h is availabk 'when I or my ancestors after the 
limitation of a~sise ... wtre not seised of the customs and services or

one theory at least, each was aligned to specific statuses such that

themselves were either arma vera or arma fa/sa, true or false arms, 
depending upon the relationship of colours to metals and the usc 
specific elements. It was false armory to misrepresent elements of the 
armorial code, such as to intermix in the same device natural and , 
artificial signs.·3 I t was also and for analogous reasons false armory to

The details of the various branches of armory - enigmas, devices,

; .. ,,:mo,.1 The heraldic use of signs functions legally to dilTerentiate 
identify the individual according to a system of origins and proof 
origins. Its identificatory marks within civil contexts all refer the 
identified individual to a corporate or civic place first by virtue of his 
family and secondarily by reference to either a specific dignity (office) 
or a form of tenancy and its accompanying fealties. Each place is 
bonded to particular forms of representation or symbolisation and we 
will return to the social significance of the code of honour and of 
fidelily that governs that bonding and uhimatdy relates the human to 
the divine and to death.2 Prior to any examination of content, 
however, the heraldic systcm raises questions of rhetorical form and 
of epistolary usc. Using the contemporary sixteenth- and early 
seventeenth-century systematisations of heraldic method, I will 
concentrate here upon qucstions of the legalisation of this imagistic 
language, and the formal constraints imposed upon its system of 
notation or writing; constraints that affect both the form of rep res en-
tation and its conlent, bOlh its body and its soul. 
The systematic armorial form books invariably precede their 
doctrinal presentations of the substantive divisions and parts of the 
discipline with a briefhislOry and philosophy of the composition and 
bearing of signs. J n common with all the major humanistic reformula-
tions of the disciplines, armory is granted a theological genealogy and 
a first place amongst the orders of representation. The philosophical 
origins of armory lie in pictograms and hieroglyphics, in a holy

there, by a gesture and for motives that are profoundly necessary, whose 
degradation is easier to denounce than it is to disclose their origin, one says 
'language' for action, movement, thought, reflection, consciousness, unconscious-
ness, experience. affectivity, etc. Now we tend to say "writing" for all that and 
more: \0 designate not only physical gestures ofliteral pictographic or ideographic 
inscriptions, but also the totality of what makes it possible; and also, beyond the

and jurisdictions, from the modern discipline of law. In providing 
preliminary historical assessment of certain legal discourses con-
cerned to regulate and restrict the inscription and circulation of 
particular forms of sodal meaning, I will concentrate upon the .: 
linguistic presuppositions of the exclusion of rhetoric. It will be 
argued that the exclusion in question - the banishment of rhetoric, of 
oral teachings and of conversation as explicit sources oflaw, in favour 
of a Ramisl conception oflogical method - did not drive rhetoric vut 
of law bUI rather drove it w-ithin. The exclusion was in practice a 
repression, the full irony of which only becomes apparent when it is 
recognised that it was in the name, and for the cause, oflhe rhetorical 
art of memory that the repression in question was initially 
perpetrated. 
Legal Writing Systems 
The manner in which I intend to use a concept of the grammatologi-
cal analy:;is oflaw draws directly upon a notion ofa rhetoric of writing 
or of epiMolary laws. It may be most easily formulated in terms of 
grammatological themes rather than by definition. Taking the 
sixteenth·century emergence of the first printed legal literature as a 
crucial point of reference and transmission, legal grammatology will 
be concerned with a series of broadly institutional questions: 'Who is 
writing? To whom? To send, to destine, to dispatch what? To what 
address?'! 
First, there is the issue of the technology or mode of production of-
and commentary upon - law. As with all the great transitions in 
English law, the emergence of a common law method or dogmatics 
owes its central tenets to continental jurisprudence and particularly 
to humanistic legal philology. A scribal culture of feudal chirography 
. (handwriting), of the engrossing and tabling of fines and charges 
relating to land, was gradually systematised by doctrinal writers into 
a legal icriturt.2 In the hands of Coke and Davies the central doctrinal

In d a.s!ical legal terms we must note that the French ieril refers, like its 
English equivalent 'writ', both to writing and to law . The concept of icrilfl. rt is one 
of the joining of writing to law within a system oflexts. For Legendre, that is the 
lesson of the Roman concept of ratio scripta: 'the authority of genealogy has its 
pn,\"f"nance in the authority of texts founded on the principle of Reason. That is 
d,·· ;;re,tt lesson to be drawn from the history of Roman law: the power and the

n~m,"hodor technical discipline of national law. In the face ofa new 
1Jec:hrlOl'''IlJI, the haphazard scribal practices associated with keepers 
-ofth" re,lI, and with registers and custodians ofinsrruments and writs 
to be formally replaced with a national written law. In classical 
; ·'r~Ie,,)ri(:al terms. the first question is that of the institution to which 
legal discourse is tied, a question which Aristotle poses in Book One of 
the Rhetoric in terms of genre as the material site or locus of oratorical 
enunciation. In a more recent terminology, it is the question of who 
speaks, by what authority, in the name of what text, of what law?! 
Law printing created a number of possibilities with regard to the 
visibility, accessibility and availability of law. It made possible what 
the Ramisl Abraham Fraunce termed a 'logic of law', by which he 
a systematic presentation of general legal concepts under 
which particular rules· of law might be suDsumed. In the eve.nt, 
however, law printing was not a popular ising or systematising 
innovation. Law texts were published by ~t restricted number of 
licensed printers. The texts were idiosyncratically selected for 
. publication, and liable to be expensive and lengthy. They were 
written almost exclusively for the profession itself and consequently 
remained either in· Latin or in law French. In terms of the production 
.' and transmission or sending of legal knowledge, the new form of 
inscription of legal texts did not challenge but rather reaffirmed the 
'. established order of the legal institution and its presentation of 
writing as governed by a dogmatics oflhe un ..... riuen word. In Davies' 
. words, the law remained explicitly a tradition as well as a collection of 
books)2 in consequence of which legal writing had always to be 
approached as a representation, as an equivocal sign of hidden 
depths, and not as a profane, accessible or vernacular object of 
interpretation. Outside of the profession - and frequently within it as 
well - the newly printed texts could be received only as opaque or 
authority of Reason are one and the same thing' (L '/tustimablt Objtt dt la 
Transmission, 1985, Paris, p. 38). For a comparable, though much broader

reference to the dogmatic space of myth. Either God or sovereign 
gives these honours or alternatively they have always been there I it 
has always been like that, and there is no reason to change 
immemorial practice. I The notions of reference and authenticity 
indicate further issues of signification. The notational system 
established by the armorial code is strictly denotative: the emblem or 
sign in civil contexts belongs to a family I a dignity or a degree of 
gentility. The sign was a nOte that named and guaranteed the identity 
and quality of its bearer. It distinguishes and identifies the bearer and 
thereby had a nominal function, that of noting and publicly declaring 
membership of a social genre with all the attendant duties and 
privileges of that genre: a nominihus, ad anna, sequuntur argumenta, 
reasons or arguments taken from the name follow to their arms.2 In 
this respect the sign is a complex form of proper noun. I ts function is 
twofold. First, as a name, it refers uniquely to its bearer and 
distinguishes and names both his degree of nobility and his personal 
attributes or differences. The emblem as identificatory sign springs 
from the blood and in law can be neither sold nor otherwise granted or 
alienated. In familial terms, 'armes do attend both the body and the 
soul of the bearer'; they are a 'privilege perpetual' attending the 
person.s The sign is simply an outward mark or token that refers to an 
original nobility, a virtue or deed or quality of mind of the first bearer: 
underpinning the materiality of the sign is a corresponding state of the 
soul. Similarly, the emblem of dignity is attached as an incident or 
inseparable accident to the office it represents, 'even as a shadow 
waits on the body'. 
Sufficient has been said to illustrate the rigours of emblemata and 
of their composition and use. The function of arms was that of a 
theocratic distribution of honour, of names and their social qualifica· 
tion or genre. Each sign tied its bearer to a specific identity and 
required (hal he remain so linked to the original meaning or 
immemorial quality of which the sign was the body, oroutward mark.

A special court, that of Constable and Marshal, was established by 
statute (13 Richard II cap. 11).in the mid-fourteenth century with full 
incarceral and capital jurisdictions to oversee and regulate all 
disputes relating to arms. I Under the presidency of the Earl Marshal, 
the King Herald and diverse other heralds and pursuivants had 
judicial powers both to devise arms and to slrip and punish those 
bearing false or falsely composed arms. Usurpation of the arms of 
another or the forging of the arms of a dignity were both serious 
crimes and punishable, either by death or by lengthy imprisonment, 
as crimenJalsi.2 To forgery can be added a string of further crimes 
relating to the possession, inscription and bearing of arms. The most 
serious relate to failure to respect the hierarchy of honours in the 
inscription of the device itself. As noted earlier, such an offence could 
be e~ther treason or petty (reason depending on the status ofthc party 
offended. More generically. an action de scarniaiis magnatum lay against 
those who injured the honour or name of a nobleman; an actio iniuriam 
against any ungentle person who detracted from the honour of a 
gentleman. 3 To the general title to actions for defaming the honour of 
nobility or gentility can be added various further specin.c crimes 
against the image. An action thus lay for crimen iniuriae, ,"for any 
dtfacement, removal or taking down of arms from their authorised 
place. Further, to treat the arms of the sovereign in any disrespectful 
manner, 'to set them forth on a reversed esc.utcheon or to place them 
~y any shameful and dishonourable matter, sign, emblem or writing', 
was also treason.4 Amongst the more esoteric offences against honour 
we might end with an example drawn from war by noting that there 
was an action for iniuria sennonis, injury by words, which lay against 
anyone who asserted that insignia had been abandoned on the 
battlefield. 
Symbolaeography 
In rhetorical terms, the armorial system of notation or of authentic 
representation of the various forms of filiation creates a public sphere.

ideal realm of discourse, of legitimate representation, and simul·

complex and complete code of inscription or writing, and it received 
number of systematic expositions and reformulations as a result 
Ramist impetus towards didactic or methodical presentations of all 
the arts. The mmlt important of such presentations were 
. 
dedicated to or written by members of the Inns of Court. 
The art of heraldry is most usually attributed a dual origin. ]n 
theological terms, it is derived from the story of genesis: Seth through 
signs or marks identifies himself and his family as true nobil~ty , as 
'having the place of his father' against his ignoble brother Cain. I In 
strictly theological terms, armory thus marks out the son that takes 
the place of the father and who is honoured in the eyes of God.~ ; 
although we should note that Cain too and all his descendant~ are 
equally marked; he is no less than 'destined to dishonour ~ a runnagate 
... condemned to a vagrant life, uncertain of his dwelling, without 
allotment or patrimony, or establishment of his family in any fixed 
place, or permanent inheritance ... [marked] by signs and out",,rard 
tokens, of servility, unnobleness and ignominy'.2 On the positive :;ide, 
Seth's honour is worn as a badge by the son and by his heirs for all 
time. In broader terms, 'it is known, that almighty God is the original 
author of honouring nobility who, even in heaven hath made a 
discrepance of his heavenly spirits~ giving them several names as 
ensigns ofhonour'.3 
In post-diluvian and more secular terms, armory concerned 
specific systems of military or royal communication (currours) and 
reward. The etymology of the word is generally agreed by 
systematisers of the art to indicate its original use, 'heralt' deriving 
from the Teutonic here-heall, meaning military champion or repre-
sentative of the army who would carry messages of war and peace to 
the enemy in carefully staged forms"~ More general definitions of the

specific claim to coherence or codtpleteness, It is a formbook and so 
the bulk of its content is repetitive; it provides a catalogue of the 
existing scribal standard forms for a variety of legal transactions. 
Such specimen documents arc available elsewhere, either in earlier 
form books or in manuscript. I The significance of West's work is 
doctrinal. Accompanying the extraordinarily detailed presentation of 
written forms is an account ofthd theory oflegal chirography, of the 
rules of composition of instrumerlts, together with an account of the 
doctrine or 'causes' presupposed in the notarial art or profession. 
As a writing system, symbolaeography may properly be described 
as symbolic. What is symbolised i~ primarily and simply a question of 
membership ofa system of inscription, of belonging to the language of 
legal record.2 In West's prosaic definition of the legal instrument, it is 
'a formal writing made in paper or parchment, wherein are contained 
and described contracts, covenants, last wills, or other facts and 
things of persons for the testimony or memory thereof. 3 This 
distinctive system of notation is first a formal system of representa-
tion. Its primary concern is with forms of bonding, of contract, in 
which 'any man confesses himselfby his writing, orderly made, sealed 
and delivered' ,. The confession or contract binds absolutely. It binds 
internally as confession and it binds externally as writing. I n terms of 
confession or internal qualities, the instrument is bona fide and 
guaranteed true both by good faith - it is signed by and identified with 
the person - and by the Defender of the Faith, by the initial addressee 
of any instrument, God's representative, the sovereign. Ifwe look at· 
the form of address of the covenants, grants (feoffements) and wills 
listed in West, they are uniformly written in the name of God (De( 
gratia) and addressed to the immediate custody of the kingdom of God: 
. or the defender of the faith (fide; delellsor). While the precise; 
formulation varies according to particular forms of instrument, no: 
document is complete without a standard invocation of an eternal ' 
guarantee, be it the entire community of the faithful to whom the 
writing is presented (omnibus christi fidelibus ad quos praesenles literae 
ptrvtntrint) or the one and universal king of justice (reg. univtrsel singulis

iusticiariis), eternal lord (salultm in domum sempiternam) or some variant 
invocation of the same. I 
The divine addressee oflegal scripts might seem anachronistic or 
formulaic, an archaic epistolary ritual to which little significance 
should be attributed. The sacral quality of legal writing, which the 
Roman tradition has coined as ratio scripta, written reason, is best 
seen, however, as being directly performative: it symbolises and 
signals a peculiar and permanent discourse whose written marks are 
legally 'apt and significant' in each and every character or word.2 It 
also announces a discourse which is in all ordinary senses hermetic· 
ally sealed, the property ofthc institution to which it is tied and within 
which it circulates according to strict offices of ingrossing, tabling, 
noting, posting and custody of the various instruments and fines dealt 
with by West . . That principle of restriction can be illustrated by 
further critical examination of the rhetorical form of written 
instruments. [n addition to fairly obvious orthographic and calli .. 
graphic requirements of clarity of script and avoidance of interlinear 
glosses and abbreviations, the writing of instrument.s proceeds 
according to a classically prescribed order of place, person, occasion, 
manner of doing, cause, exception, (and) condition. Each topic in 
that order is governed by rules of citation, of repetition and precedent 
form. 
To take but one example, the detailed regulation of legal inscrip· 
tion can be illustrated most succinctly by reference to the law of 
misprision or textual error. The bulk of rules relating to composition 
required precise repetition of standard formulae in the immemorial 
language of the law, together with procedures of naming, signing and 
delivering or ingrossing and prodaiming. As regards naming, or 
'additions', a writ or instrument would fail if it lacked certainty of 
name, which certainty included additions of 'curtesie of place, 
dignity, estate, degree, misterie or occupation'.3 A writ which 
designated a knight a gentleman (generoso) would thus fail, as would 
I The examples are aU taken rrom West though the tradition of such forms of 
address to a divine auditor and judge is a venerable one in legal documents. For 
much earlier examples, see Rolx:rtson (ed.), AngLo.Saxoll Charlen (1956, London).

writing or art of sacred letters that makes use of a wide variety of 
enigmatic representations, of 'emblems! pictures, hidden conceits, 
hieroglyphs, symbols and enigmas' , I to portray qualities or images of 
the soul. The images that exist in the soul are themselves impresses or 
marks 'draughts and resemblances' of divine archetypes of all the 
specie~ and objects. Within the human soul, God has imprint.ed the 
marks and symbols, the diverse characters or script, of that which, by 
virtue cfits very divinity, cannot be directly presented. The science of 
those originary 'holy letters' is esoteric, 'abstruse and sacred', for the 
primordial reason that the name of God. was consigned to the human 
heart in the veiled or shrouded form of symbols, enigmas and other 
figures that range from mutilation of the body to the symbolic 
inscriptions of religious ritual. At one level, the principle involved in 
the circulation of such holy letters or signs was one of opacity; these 
marks were either esoteric by virtue of the political status of the bearer 
or they were opaque as the signs arGod, The formal principle of such 
inscription was clear only in the most general ofter~s, namdy.t~at 
the sign indicated formidable and occasionally sacred lOner qualmes: 
'but armes shall be accompted, as the goods and riches of the soul. For 
they are the rewards, the signlfications, and outward marks of virtue, 
which have proceeded, from the soul or mind of the first bearer'.2

generalised principle of the esoteric transmission of sacred knowledge 
accepts that divinely given knowledge be restrictively disseminated 
through the mediation of signs. Knowledge of the code of the 
particular disciplines is thus to be construed as a privilege, as a 
dignity, nobility or honour, It is an honour, first, in a metaphysical 
sense because custody of the meaning of signs is a custody of an 
unseen and unwritten (divine) truth entrusted originally to holy 
heralds and only subsequently made available to the Church. In

armorial insignia represent a system of social fealty based upon an 
invisible order of truth. In a profane or political sense, knowledge is 
encoded and is specifically kept from the general and ignoble public: 
they can neither know nor bear arms of honour or virtue, Of those that 
do bear arms, the appropriate: term is nobilitas which derives from 
rwsco, to know, to bdong to an honourable lineage and so to be both 
the bearer of a tradition of knowledge and also known or noted, set 
apart. Conjoint with nobiJitas is dignilas, the office which nobility must 
needs hold by dint of knowledge. In political terms, all offices are 
dignities and bear their own insignia or holy letters: pOSJusio dignitatis, 
probatur per insignia, possession of a dignity is proved through its 
insignia. 
The political force of the sacral naturt~ of public office and dignity 
needs little emphasis; armory was simply the means of its notation. As 
a system of such notations, armory introduces and circulates two 
crucial notions, namely those of the authority and authenticity of 
emblematic signs. I The authority of the sign is a question of 
legitimacy, a matter of origin, of birth or descent, the lineage that will 
refer the sign either to an immemorial or to a divine source, That 
legitimacy - the absolute reference - precludes the need for justifica-
tion outside of the benediction or aueton/as of faith itself: each 
politically established dignity or office has access to the sanctity of the 
sign and may therefore speak as something other than the human 
voice - as impersonal ojJicium or function, as justice or law or right, as 
scripture or sign, Nobility is thus authority; it is a form of access to a

towards a question oflinguistics.

and reputed a principal part of the Royal treasure? .. Lastly, is not the 
learned Professor of law lux in tenehriI - a star in the firmament of the 
Commonwealth? Is not his house an oracle not only to a Town or a City, 
but to a whole country?1 
These are, in other words, no ordinary texts, nor simply scrivenings. 
They belong to a tradition in which the text is immediately a relic, a 
ruin, a truth or sacred item immediately surrounded by stone and 
anathemas or by the names of Coke and the other sages of the 
common law. 
The claim to access to truth through legal signs has an interesting 
negalive correlate, namely that other languages or modes of access to 
truth were stringently outlawed. Contemporary compilations of 
penal writs contain astonishingly detailed doctrinal condemnations 
of the various forms ofm(:taphysical rnisuseofwords and signs. To the 
obvious offences of blasphemy, heresy and treason by words can be 
added a whole series of illicit professions of signs, including magic, 
soothsaying, wizardry, divination,juggling, sleight of hand, enchant-
ing and charming, witchery, haggery, sorcery and finally augury.2 In 
relation to each such indictable offence the doctrinal issue is primarily 
that of the false oracle or 0: illicit characters, writings, pictures and 
images presenting hidden knowledge or illicit truth. Thus, to take one 
example, the magician is indicted [or what appear to be false and 
unnatural representations, hallucinations that are the work of the 
outside, of the Devil. The magician is one 'which by uttering of certain 
superstitious words conceived, adventures to attempt things above 
the course of nature, by bringing forth dead men's ghosts as they are 
falsely pretended, in showing of things either secret or far off, and in 
showing them in any shape or likeness'.3 The magician summons 
things that should not be seen, images that are not for mortal eyes, 
image~ that are outside the law of images, or ius imaginarium, images 
that are unnatural but real, idols or false augurs, and he is punished 
for leaving the everliving God and the prescribed images of his nature. 
In other indictments and writs of abjuration, enchanters and 
charmers are charged with (seemingly successfully) fulfilling wishes 
through 'words pronounced, characters and images'; they are termed 
inchantors or incantators because 'he is one qui carminibus, aut 
cantiunculis Datmontm ad jurat. Thcy were of ancient called carmina

because in those days their charms were in verse.'1 [n legislation 
referred to by Coke, 'if any person, Or persons take upon him or them, 
by witchcraft, inchantment, charm or sorcery to tell or declare, in 
what places any treasure Or gold or silver should or might be found, or 
had in the earth, or other secret places; ... or to provoke any person to 
unlawful Jove'. those things are punishable. 2 Jugglers, through words 
and writings called charms, can cure diseases. Soothsayers and 
wizards usurp the role of the oracle and roretell the future by evil 
means. A conjurer 'is he that by the holy and powerful names of 
almighty God invokes and conjures the Devil to consult with him, or 
to do some acts', while diviners could divine where lost or stolen 
things now rested.3 
Where the law of arms paid particular attention to the crime of 
falsity, the usurpation of a dignity, the symbolaeography stresses 
crimes of verbal or scriptural falsity, the usurpation of the notarial art 
or office. What is particularly heinous in the listed 'offences by words' 
is not so much any direct contumely which (hey offer to God4 but 
rather that they challenge or usurp the power to name which has 
increasingly come to define the principal territory of the legal 
profession. As oath swearers and notaries, it is the office of the lawyer 
to invoke and manipulate mystic words. It is the profession which 
knows and preserves the true meaning of alien signs. which can read 
the omens, the augurs, the fates, the insignia of other or future worlds. 
By diverse scribal and epistolary rules it is the legal oracle alone that 
can legitimately call up the immemorial past and through its 
originary signs, its self-presence in the legal text, can determine and 
limit the contours - the shapes and likenesses - of the future. In 
historical and philosophical terms, it can be argued that the legal 
writing system has become exemplary of writing as such. I will 
examine first the historical argument and will conclude with the 
philosophical.

taneously marked out the space of public dignities and, in particular, 
those of politics and law. The armorial sign was addressed specifically 
to that public sphere and its institutions. It was addressed erga omnu, 
to all those with access to the public sphere. To the unaffiliated, those 
not possessed of such honour or nobility, it simply represented in 
diverse forms the mystic legitimacy of sovereign discourse and its 
various delegated public powers or offices. Those without publiC 
names or insignia were neither intended nor equipped to receive t,he 
discourse of the soul, a discourse emanating from the ideal and 
destined for the audience of either nobilitas or dignila.s: 'according to 
their modern or present use, arms may be said to be hieroglyphic or 
enigmatic symbols or signs ... external notes of the inward disposi-
tion of the mind, manifesting in some sort the natural qualities of their 
bearers, yet so as they were hidden from the vulgar sort, and known to 
thejudicious only'; they were signs 'neither obscure to the learned nor 
over-familiar to the common sort'.' 
As writing, the composition of insignia mirrors the ideal quality of 
their sociai function. In terms of their content, arms are either true or 
false. There are numerous technical compositional rules requiring 
particula.r styles of representation and reference,2 particular hier-
archies of signs and an enigmatic or 'strange' language of mottos, of 
thc sou1.3 For present purposes, the generally significant rule wa.. .. that 
the authenticity of the sign related to its origin or source; its lineage 
must be traceable either beyond memory or to some other founda-
tional act. I n that sense, the language ofinsignia is a ritual language of 
repetition and accretion, a language of liturgy or theatre within a 
strictly qualified social space. What qualified that public space was a 
mixture of divinity and antiquity, virtue and blood, whose discourse 
or insignia were governed by law against any false lineage, forged 
dignity or improperly composed (unnatural) arms. If we move now to 
the second writing sysu:m, symbolaeography or the rules for writing 
instruments and precedents, a dose parallel may be drawn between 
the restrictive inscription of insignia and the law governing the 
linguistic content of contractual documents. Legal writing belongs to 
and develops from the symbolic tradition of holy letters or enigmatic 
transmission. In linguistic terms, the traqition is similarly nominalist 
and bonded: the meaning of legal script or scrivening is judged :

according to its lineage, antiquitl1.tt tt ttmport, by antiquity and time or 
in contemporary terms by reference to tradition and sources, a 
legitimacy of lineage. of descent. I 
The term symbolaeography is coined by William West as the title 
. of a form book of legal precedents and rules of legal writing first 
published in '592 and subtitled TilL Art or D"mptwn or Image of 
Instruments, or the Pl1.ttme of Presidents or the Notarit or ScrivtTlu. In 
etymological terms, symbolaeography has an interesting duality. In 
one derivation from the Greek, .rymbolum refers to a contract and so 
symbolaeography would ·be the writing of contracts or contractual 
writing: either signs that bind or the bonding of signs. From the Latin 
.rymbolus there is a more general sense of the symbol as mark or token 
or seal. While general usage interprets the symbol as a material mark, 
figure or character that stands for, repn:sents or denotes something 
else, it also bears a more restrictive religious and legal meaning. The 
symbol is a creed or confession offaith, a briefformal statement of the 
religious belief of the Christian faith or of a particular church or sect. 
The symbol as creed is a sign of identification of believers as against 
pagans or heathens. Symbolaeography would in that respect be the 
written statement offaith or. by transpOsition, the statement of legal 
faith in writing and in the truth of its characters and representations. 
In the hands oflhe legal scriveners and notaries, the symbol assign of 
faith in law, as a form of belief and sanctification of the written has a 
further powerful representation. In the words of Sir Edward 'Coke, 
legal writing is no ordinary or mere writing 'of any scrivener's boy in 
his master's shop'. 2 Legal writing is rathc:r a learned art in a learned 
language. Nor does that documentary language signify as ordinary 
language, but rather as a code or system oflegal scripts. As is quickly 
made clear in the symbolaeography, the predominant form oflegal 
notation is epistolary; it is a system of charters, writs, registered 
formulae, inscribed tables, notes and fines that circulate within the 
various jurisdictions and archives oflhe legal institution. 
The tradition that William West attempts to codify and methodise 
is properly described as notarial. It deVelops from the rhetorical ars 
dietandi and concerns the minute regulation of every orthographic, 
syUabic and other scribal detail orthe production, storage or custody 
and circulation of documents for legal use. The significance of 
symbolaeography does not reside in novelty of Content nor in any

notes is a static faith of attachment or of belonging which establishes a 
complex series of specific fidelities as the signs under which we pay 
homage to law, to the restriction of social meaning to the dignities of 
legal office. In rhetorical terms, it may simply be observed that if the 
note is always in principle sent from the irrational space of the 
immemorial, and if it is God or some other originary legisl"otor who 
invariably signs it and sends it to law, then there is little hermeneutic 
room left in which to argue as to its other meanings or as to its 
guarantees. In more technical terms, the semantic possibilities of the 
legal text are overdetermined by the issues of documentation and 
status that travel under the lexica-grammatical axioms and exegetical 
rules of notation. 
Conclusion 
The linguistic note is a sign or mark that is attendant UpOfl and stands 
in for an object. The legal note similarly represents and guarantees a 
specific transaction. Both senses of note involve a proprietary relation 
in which the note is the mere mark or token of a real object, action or 
speech. In that respect it is the obvious duty of the custodians of the 
note, the notaries. to keep faith with the referent, to recollect the 
sender. of whose intention the nott is never more than the symbol. 
Fidelity to meaning or to the conservation of authoritative prior 
meanings marks the legal writing systems examined in this chapter as 
systems of restriction: the note contracts; it reduces. it limits, it binds. 
It might also be said that in claiming to represent real properties it 
becomes a form of property, a unit in a system of exchange, a token of 
good faith, of propriety or of horlOur and traditional virtues. 
The economic metaphor deserves a brief elaboration. The system 
of exchange that formed the content of the heraldic and symbolaeo-
graphic systems of notation was chivalric and feudal. It is precisely in 
terms of content, as the expression of an elaborate hierarchy of 
honorific forms of prop~rty holding or tenure, that legal notation finds 
its most characteristic place and use. In each instance of inscription 
studied the principal content of the system analysed was the marking 
of political faith. The feudal legal structure was primarily a hi~r· 
archkally ordered system of property holding. The insignia of tenure 
were arms or the abse.nce of arms. while legal writing developed 10

tenure into its proper place with respect to the duties or fealties of 
tenancy. Those duties corresponded to the various degrees of honour 
and were carried with the holding ofland, itself termed 'feodum' or 
'feud urn' from th~ Latin fideum, faith or trust. All land was held in' fee 
{fide}, which is to say, faithfully. I Tenancy was always ultimately of 
the sovereign and obtained by original grant and subsequently by the 
various forms of feudal donation or 'enfeoffment', the term again 
being etymologically derived from faith or fidelity, and connoting 
the passing of property by patronage and with fealty,fide velfidelitatt.2 
Each form of tenancy, from the lowest forms of villeinage and 
vassallage to the highest nobility, was taken upon oath offealty [0 the 
superior lord and entailed some ceremony of homage (lwminium), 
some sign or symbol of subjection to sovereignty, of fidelity and 
allegiance to the feudallord.'1 In a literal sense the signs of law, the 
rlotes of property holding, were tokens of faith and emblems of the 
original grant which bound the tenant to fidelity to both lord and 
prince. ~ The note here has a further meaning from the Latin nola and 
can be interpreted as brand or stigma or mark of censorship and place 
within the hierarchy of political faith. 
The content of legal writing systems obviously changed rapidly 
after their early systematisations. The second edition of West, for 
instance, is double the length of the first and the additional material 
reproduced is largely taken up with mercantile instruments. Even at 
the time of the first edition, much of the substantive content of the 
symbolaeography and allied works was already somewhat anachron-
istic, not simply in its language but also in its detail. The grants of 
manumission of bondswomen and villeins are the most obvious 
example.5 The hidden motive for examining early forms of legal 
writing system, however, was simply to suggest that the development 
of a system of legal inscription owed most of its formal properties to 
theocratic conceptions of government and law. It was also intended to 
suggest that law, or the legality of the sign, was very much a part of the 
early systematisation of the vernacular disciplines and that in 
consequence it would be unfortunate to exclude the question of law 
when considering the development of linguistics and the other

any writ in which anyone of the listed additions formdlly addressing 
either the king or the recipient of the writ was omitted.' By an 
analogous logic, the symbolaeography also warns of the disastrous 
consequences offalse Latin or law French and summarises a law of 
mi$prision (false spelling and inaccurate record) which was more 
litigated and legislated upon than virtually any other contemporary 
issue. Famous common law cases included the failure of a criminal 
count for using the word 'burgaliter' instead of the proper form 
'burglariter', ofa writ for recovery in waste for use of , de stricti on em' 
in place of , destruction em" and 'hacre' for 'haeredi' in a writ of 
prarcip, 
q~od reddat. The general rule with regard to written 
instruments may be summarised as requiring proper form, ,n the 
absence of which wording they will fail. On the other hand, once the 
instrument or other writing has been entered on record, that is to say 
formally knowledged, noted, proclaimed and then ingrossed, it is 
taken to be true and will generally be irreversible even where the 
record is manifestly false. In a case cited by Sir John Doderidge, the 
clerk to the court had mistakenly recorded an outlawry where the writ 
had in fact been rebutted. On appeal by the plaintiff in person, the 
justices, who had been present at the original hearing, recollected that 
the record was wrong but observed that [he-misprision was nQne the 
less on the record and testified outlawry.:l 
The Symboiatography at several points specifies a requirement of 
plain style in legal documentation which should express 'all things 
certainly with apt significant words and therein eschewing all 
metaphorical, figurative, and borrowed speeches, and all w9rds of 
divers or doubtful significations'.3 The content of the documents 
exhaustively reproduced by West indicates that a plain style refers 
simply to accurate encrypting, together with a resistance to borrow-
ing from non-legal discourses. The encoded character of legal 
documents is hardly questionable and in pcint of doctrine their 
encoding is their primary virtue, their language remaining pristine 
and unadulterated pre-cisely be dint of never having been a spoken 
language or, inde(,d, a language used for any purpose other than law. 
What West presents is thus a language of originals, wh~ch are 
faithfully reproduced at extraordinary length and in the unrevised

typ~s of property and property ownership, symbolacography created 
a system of symbolic representation, of truths guaranteed by a 
llrinciple of source and repetition, a system of notes or insignia that 
tonstituted a pub\ic sphere uP9n a logic of tradition, of immemorial

MEMORY, PRECEDENT AND WRITING SYSTEMS OF LAW 
What emerges most strongly in the printed curricula accounts of 
the legal discipline published from the early sixteenth century 
onwards, and associated with forensic rhetoricians such as Thomas 
Wilson and with Ramists such as Abraham Fraunce, Sir John 
Doderidge and William Fulbecke, is the fundamentally linguistic 
character of the developing 'science' of common law. In its early 
vernacular presentations, the discipline of law is defined - and 
arguably obscured - as a discipline of words. Using precisely the same 
terms and myth as the systematisers of armory, I the legal word is to be 
taken as a sign and in consequence 'may be compared to certain 
images called Siltni Alcibiadts, whose outward features were deformed 
but within they were full of jewels and precious stones'.1 Thosejewels, 
according to the doctrinal writers discussed in Chapter Three, were 
the deposits of time immemorial, mined by the lawyer from the 
inexhaustibly rich seam of native custom extending beyond the 
'memory of man'. Mystic notions Qf time immemorial, of forgotttn 
sources or of a divinely inscribed natural law underwriting the 
frequently invisible history of positive law are conjoined in a theory of 
language itself as a contractually based system of notation. 
At a superficial level the curricula authors simply reaffirm and 
generalise the arguments of symbolaeography. Increasingly. the 
predominant function of the lawyer is to document and to record. 
Grammar - meaning Latin and only by analogy correct usage - is in 
consequence the first art, the forms of discourse being the instruments 
of knowledge (sed jc~nda instrumenta suntJormae discenderi). The study of 
language. however. has further legal meanings and a constitutional 
significance. There is first an argument from myth, an argument 
common to the Ciceronian tradition and repeated by the forensic 
rhetoricians.3 The origin of society is to be comprehended as a 
consequence of the grant or gift oflanguage. The fallen state of nature 
was finally superseded and society establishro through the offices of 
poetry and rhetoric. Poets and orators were revealers and seers. They 
alone remembered the character of originals and through images and 
words presented objective memorials of true understanding, namely 
of the divinely ordained or natural order oflaw." The lawyers could

'inco.rporate that notion of an original missive· and coincident 
; rhetorical order in the simple assertion that the legal tradition was 
precisely the custodian of the divinely ordained 'revealed' ordr:r and 
that its sources in immemorial time were those first words or notes 
agreed between God and Adam. 
The substantive form that such an argument takes is classically 
nominalist: 'our ancient language consisted in the beginning of 
monosyllables and each word being of one syllable had his own 
proper signification put into the minds of such as first received it by 
almighty God'.1 Words are notes - either sounds or marks - of agreed 
meanings. Each word (monosyllable) is attached to and stands for or 
names an agreed object or thing: 'For words be notes of things, and of 
all words either derivative or compound, you may yield some reason 
made (fet] from the first arguments, if the notation be well made. It is 
called, Originalio, quod on·ginem verhorum explicel: et Etymologia, id esl, 
vtriloquium [Origination, because it explains the origin of words: and 
Etymology, that is, true speech1.'';,! The principle of notation is thus a 
principle of naming or defining the originary signification of the word 
and on the basis of that authoritative or given definition further 
compound arguments can be developed as deductions from or 
extrapolations of the founding axiom. ·Legal dogmatics is in this 
respect simply presented as the most authoritative - the oldest - social 
language of reference and its terms and axioms arc therefore to be 
understood as closest to God and to natural law. It is law that silences 
the Babel of tongues and thereby first establishes or contracts the 
rhetorical bond of social order. 
The theory of notation suggests a necessary correspondence 
between understanding and law. The basis of that correspondence 
lies in anamntsis or recollection of a primary reference attributed by 
lawyers to an original speaker and a constitutive social moment. 
There are, in short, true (authoritative) meanings to words, and 
dogmalic argument simply and fai,hfully develops those lawful bonds 
of reference. The linguistic faith of the lawyer is a faith in memory. It 
is memory that provides the definition of words and restricts all 
possible ambiguities and polysemy more generally under the strict 
notation or lexical meaning of each and every term. The theory of

content, was scrupulously supervised: each It:tter and syllable was to , 
be 'significant and known to the law'. At this point wt: may simply 
note that postal communication entailed - by virtue of statutory and·· 
case law provisions I - that each word used was fixed in advance, that 
it bc:1onged to a standard or recognised form, that it referred to its 
proper, legally designated rt:ferent. 
The institutional implications. of the post do not stop with the 
objectified form or language of the writ or letter. To use the post is in the 
first instance to enter into a specific, centrally regulated jurisdiction, a 
specific domain of discourse subject to rules of both lexical and semantic 1 
scope requiring, at the minimum, a specific textual form and more 
normally a legally prescribed and recognised content as well. Post or 
postea also, of course, means after or afterwards. A second aspect to our 
invocation of postal communication concerns the temporal charter 
whereby our communic.ation comes, in a dual sense, afterward. In a 
somewhat technical sense, well elaborated in the work of Jacques 
Derrida, we would note that speech has generally been formulated in 
terms of representation: the phoneme is a note ofinner qualities that are 
variously formulated by the scholastic tradition asJomuu imagiruzritU, or 
as intlllectus, inchoate senses or reason, that the notes of speech will order 
and represent.2 In social terms, speech is also already a part of tradition, 
a participant in a conventionally regulated network. As regards 
tradition and its transmission, we are involved in the receipt and sending 
on of received forms; we are both recipients and custodians of the lawful 
knowledge of tradition and ofits representation, its language. The leuer 
or signum becomes a token of participation in a juridically defined 
sociality. It betokens at the very least that we. come after and are faithful 
to - are users of-the postal network, or more generally of the tradition, 
of the system of commerce and communication: 
The charter is the conlract for the following, which quite stupidly one 
has to believe: Socrates comes bejore Plato, there is between them- and in 
general - an order of generations, an irreversible sequence of inheri· 
cance. Socrates is before, not in front of, but before · Plaw, therefore

Finally, however, post may refer to <l.n ending, to the last post, to 
death: it is possible that postmodernity precisely implies a break with 
the .temporal charter of tradition, a breach of the contract, a free or 
irreligious association of words, 
To recapitulate, the form of tradition and the form of our 
. participation in it are both linguistic and symbolic. They are 
governed by certain rules of reference but also by a theory of origin 
and image that is concerned as much with temporality, with a charter 
designating lineage or lineal relations between before and after. as 
with reference. In a purely descriptive sense we may chart the 
contract in terms of its progression from theocratic pact or covenant of 
biblical derivation requiring obedience [Q an unwritten law (nature), 
to the more positive and legalistic contract or social treaty establish· 
ing political sovereignty and a coincidental power of secular nomina· 
tion. The desire to elicit and question the more fundamental forms of 
the social contract, to enquire as to the linguistic contract or the 
veridical language that underpins juridical rule, leads us from the 
post to the lettcr: t!lat is to say, from the institution to the word, from 
the network to its elements of conduction. 
The theme that governs the various notions of pact, covenant, 
compact, convention, treaty and contraCt in their traditional forms 
may be spelled out and developed etymologically.2 The contract 
binds words to meanings, it institutes and polices reference, it decides 
in advance the terms and conditions of interpretation, of meaning. 
This fundamentally scr.iptural function of contract institutes certain 
conditions of faith, of keeping faith, well captured in the concept of 
p41cta sunt stroanda. The contract may here be interpreted in the sense of 
"m-lraho; it draws together, it binds, but we may note that in doing so

interpretative or human sciences, In particular, it raises the question 
ofsemantic faith, of the allegiance or contract that binds the note to its 
singular object and the word to its unitary referent. 
The common theme to legal systems of inscription and the more 
general theories of notation developed, in particular, by English 
grammarians, philologists and logicians is the rhetorical art of 
memory as the condition of attachment to tradition and its linguistic 
community. The art of armory was explicitly a form of codification 
and symbolisation of ancestry, of lineage or blood and the dignities 
attendant upon them. The coat of arms was a systematically 
formulated note or reminder of ancient honours and fealties. It 
referred to qualities that were to be reinvoked and emulated for, in 
John Ferne's graphic depiction, the production of 'ancient statuaes, 
smoakic images, autcntique coate-armors, torne and rotten guidons, 
of the valiant and virtuous ancestors' would not of itself subdue the 
enemy. 1 The systematic accounts of the discipline of arms simply set 
out the (agreed' units or axioms of armorial representation, the 
lexicon and syntax of the proper composition of an esoteric tradition 
offiliation. The Symbolaeography similarly codified the scriptural rules 
for the composition of various forms of authentic record. The 
principal form that such records were to take was that of repetition. 
Documents were to be esoterically constructed according to lengtilily 
established standard forms. The archaic language of those forms, a 
language that had never had any other use but that of It!gal 
inscription, itself testifies to the immemorial character of legal 
writing. The instruments of law were a writing apart from other 
linguistic usages and they circulated as much as symbols ofbcliefin 
the legitimacy of the institution, as a recognition of its absolutt: S(IUrce 
and as a ritual grammar, as they served any specific identificatory or 
testamentary functions. 
Without attributing relations of cause or effect as between the 
disciplines I it is plausible to propose a general hypothesis. The 
formulation of the writing systems examined according to precepts of 
memory or, more technically, according to the classical divisions of 
the rhetorical art of memory, is profoundly dogmatic.2 In the place of

Memory, of course, is the quintessential legal art, th~ foundation of 
precedent. Memory, however, as was argued at length in Chapters 2 and 3, 
belongs to tradition and not to history, a tht:me too rich to ~ pursued again here. 
As regards contemporary definitions of memory, see T . Wilson, The Rule of Rfo,srm

rhetoric as a discipline founded upon a concept of some species of 
,public dialogue, and on occasion as· a critical sphere of political 
: discourse, is substituted an axiomatic system of insignia or scripts 
within a centrally controlled sphere of circulation. The points of 
transmission are institutionally designated sites of custody, archives 
from which the written guarantee of truth emanates as sign, 'writ' or 
promulgation. The order of writing is dogmatic in the sense of 
subordinating knowledge to memory: predicating its content upon 
received axioms the rules of writing simply order institutionally 
guaranteed definitions - the necessarily true precepts of a given 
discipline I - in that manner that best enables their retention and 
subsequent repetition. Together with the rhetoric ofrnemory there is 
a linguistics of nominal definition. In the case of honorific and legal 
signs, that which they name or note ultimately belongs within the 
institutional tradition as esoteric memory and is open to no other 
forms of challenge or dispute. The meaning of the sign is a matter of 
faith, a question oflaw. 
It remains to be observed that the law in question, and indeed the 
bulk of the subject matter of this chapter, has been presented as 
belop.ging resolutely to the past. to the premodern. The discourses in 
question, however, remain - precisely as memory, as tradition and 
precedent - as components of contemporary legal dogmatics. It 
would be surprising indeed if the legal discourse of tradition, the 
language of repetition par exctllence, were somehow to have shed its 
own sources, its own validity as predicated upon the myth of an 
immemorial accretion of discourse. In that broader cultural context it 
seems fitting to end by mimicking the Cowell ofrhe Interpreter. Where 
Cowell invoked nature and truth as the rhetorical ends oflaw, there 
might well be room in contemporary interdisciplinary dialogue to 
invoke Ihe poetic possibility of a revival of the theory of notes. The 
premodern usage of the theory of notes concentrated upon the 
authority and antiquity of the sign: it was primarily a nOte in the sense 
of a token of legal record, indelible mark of the original or 
immemoriaL In a postmodern context we could do worse than to 
recollect an alternative to that fealty of notation. The note is also a

establishes the elements of a hierarchy of oppositions which moves in 
Rousseau's text from the natural to the artificial, from passion to 
reason (law) and from rhetoric to writing. Aligned to those 
oppositions we may note, respectively, the familiar figures of 
institutionalisation: laicisation, progress and truth. During the course 
of the Essay a divinely ordained natural order will give issue to a 
laicised modern polity, passion will be displaced - though not without 
a certain nostalgic regret - by the ine .... itable progression of reason, 
while in reducing rhetoric to writing figurative signs and melodic 
verse will come to be excluded from the prosaic public discourse of 
truth. 
The rhetorical structure of the Essay is markedly progressive. In 
each instance cited the terms of the oppositions are causally related 
and broadly indicative of the necessary terms of a teleological 
institution of the social. Such is nor least the case in the opening 
declaration that speech is the first institution, a move in which Jean· 
Jacques links language to the origin of society in an inexorable and 
portentous manner. The argument is a complex one in that it mixes a 
number of different myths of origin so as to allow for an overlay of 
romantic pessimism upon the traditional myth of the fall and 
consequent ejection from the Garden of Eden. The rhetorical 
structure of the 'origin' of language can be simply outlined. The 
original language was edenic, it was born and lost with residcnce in 
the Garden of Eden. We have no idea of what the language was other 
than that 'Adam was taught by God himself' and that it was 
irredeemably lost. The first language was that in which God and man 
named the beasts and nature more generally. It would seem likely 
that it was a noun-based language and further that it represented the 
true or deepest nature oflanguage towards which aillacer endeavours 
must aim to return.:'! 
Ibid. at 103. 
2 Essay, p. 53 (discussing the roots of language): 'If you understand these 
ideas in all their ramifications, you will find that Plato's CratyiuJ is not as 
ridiculous as it appears to be.' A much more direci exposition of the point can be 
found in Hobbes, u viathan (1651 ), pp. 100-1 : 'the first author of speech was God 
himself, that instructed Adam how to name such creatures as he presented to his 
sight', adding subsequently that 'all this language gotten, and augmented by 
Adam and his posterity, was again lost at the tower of Babel, when by the hand of 
God, every man was stricken for his rebellion , with an oblivion of his former 
language.'

What is crucial 'to the conception of an originary, theocquically 
given language is neither its lexical nor its syntactic features, nor its 
grammatical composition, but rather the simple fact of its loss. The 
origin aflanguage transpires to belong to the sphere of the divine; it is 
therefore prior to or outside of history and equally significantly 
hidden and secret, a matter of myth and of ritual, of the hieroglyphs or 
holy letters of initiate (sacral) knowledge and therewith immune to 
historical or political examination. The origin becomes in this way a 
simple insignia of the absolute, an emblematic representation of an 
absence from which and, it might equally be suspected, towards 
which language is directed. Any further discussion of the origin of 
language or of the development of individual languages is subject or 
secondary to this prior model hidden from humanity in the mind of 
God. That it is hidden allows for the creation and justification of an 
unwritten doctrinal tradition to underpin and govern manifest 
language or the apparent meaning of simulacra, while the fact that it 
is lost attaches a variety of sentiments of guilt and remorse to the 
apprehension of national or historic languages - they are not the 
Father's tongue - and equally suggests the possible visitation of the 
penalties of sin upon those who endeavour to suggest any free· play or 
purely secular genesis of the meaning of words. Such freedom is 
always likely to be seen as an atheistic breach of the originary (lost) 
pact or of the primordial meaning of words known to tradition alone. 1 
The absent origin of language serves several essential rhetorical or 
argumentative functions. It suggests a 'contrat d'ordre langagier' (a 
I The disputes between Romans and Reformers over the translation and 
proper interpretation of the Bible provide good examples of this theme. Sir 
Thomas More, The Confulacyon of Tyndale's An.rwtrt, in Collecud Works (1973, New 
Haven); 'for our mailer is not of scripture, as it is taken for bare writing, such as 
every scrivener's boy writes in his master's shop, but as il signifies such holy

soul.' Much later in thl: same Confulacyrm More goes so far as to observe that 
'sometime he [GodJ wrote it 
that the letter had none other sense than 
mysteries and allegories' (ibid., p. 636). In a contemporary context, see U. Eco, 
Snniotiu and Ihe Philosophy of Languag~ (1984. New York), who, discussing 
deconstruction, refers dismissively to an atheistic and mystical multiplication of 
readings, to an 'ultimate epiphany of the symbolic mode, the text as symbol is no 
longer read in order to find in it a truth that lies outside: the only truth is the very 
play of deconstruction' (pp. 155-6). For an extended discussion of such a theme,

by texts that onc has not read, to be engaged in a relation with the 
institution on terms that have been established in advance, or to be 
addressed - interpolated - by the very means or avenue of communi· 
cation selected for contracting. The postal rule, a product of the 
classical law of contract, paradoxically reminds us that the system of 
circulation of messages, the means of communication or objectified 
text, is often of greater significance than its apparent subjective 
content. When it is a question of contract and so onaw, the postal rule 
may serve to indicate that the letter, the contractual act, may have an 
existence independent both of its sender and of its destination. 
The paradoxical character of the postal rule is emblematic of a more 
general series of questions that need to be raised as part of a postmodern 
account of contract and of the contractarian tradition. Even at the height 
of the ascendancy of lausu.-Jairt economics and of its corresponding 
doctrine of freedom of contract, the postal rule uneasily testifies to the 
intrinsically social character of the contract. It is a relationship made by 
reference to and via the avenue of the law. h is a communication that 
passes fi'om one subject to the other via the objectification - the textual 
relay - clfthe post and of all the qualifications and supplements that are 
the inevitable consequences of a centrally organised system of social 
communication. It entails thereby a series of epistolary and more 
broadly linguistic questions that are the essential subject matter of any 
critical history of the contractarian tradition and its concept of law. We 
will approach those questions of contract and transmission, of law and 
meaning, through a reading of the work of J ean-Jacques Rousseau on 
the origin of language and on contract as the origin of law. Our analysis 
will be rhetorical and will imply no necessary adherence either to the 
terms of the contract spdt out by Jean~Jacques or to Ihe laws of 
transmission by which the contract remains our tradition. First, 
however, we must make a series of preliminary advertisements 
concerning language, contract and communication, 
Our concern with the postal rule is with a metaphor for the 
institutional character of contract, ...... ithin which institution it is 
frequently impossible rigorously to distinguish legal contract from 
social contract. They are both legal forms of association, of Jocittas, 
and both equally imply participation in a tradition, within a syslem of 
communication or, better, of transmission governed by law. As 
regards the institution of the post, we will simply note certain 
institutional details concerning its centralised role, Military and civil 
messages of state were classically the province of heralds (fttialts) and 
governed by the law of arms or armory. The English post (currours)

receives its first definition in a statute of Edward VI in 1547.1 The post 
is the 'public course', the avenue of circulation ofrayal business, of the 
king's messages, and particularly of law, of edict and of writ.2 The 
office of master of the posts is attached to the king's court and takes 
Ihe form of responsibility for keeping the public course, the network of 
communications, open for royal use. 3 More specialist offices are 
subsequently attached to legal forms of postage, the term postta 
referring to writs returned from provincial courts to the royal courts to 
be decided and then engrossed (enrolled) and stored in the office of 
records (custos brtvium).1t may also be noted that every detail of such 
writs, from their orthography 10 the exact Latin phrasing of their

the currour, including surprisingly detailed description of what the heralds should 
wear - to "dlect the importance of their mission - and how they should travel

MEMORY, PRECEDENT AND WRITING SYSTEMS OF LAW 
The initial proposition which locates the source of the social in 
systems of notation or linguistic bonding is not novel. Cicero in De 
lnvenlione and in Pro Archia provided an account ora state of nature, of 
savagery I ignorance, efror - of blind aimless passion - from ~hich 
humanity escapes only through the office of poetry. Poets, var~ously 
termed vaies and uidenles, speakers or soothsayers and sects or 
revealers, are understood by the Ciceronian tradition to have bej' n the 
first ground of society, the first source of eloquence and the first 
eans 
of social communication or assembly. I Thus Rousseau takes ; up a 
recognised though now somewhat recondite tradition in arguin~ that 
'the first histories, the first speeches [harangues], [he first laws wJ rein 
verse. Poetry was created before prose. That must have been thec ase, 
since feelings speak before reason.'1 An epoch'ofprimitive ignorance, 
of inarticulacy and brute gesture, a state of nature depicted I as a 
universal state of war,3 comes to sociality only through poetry or 
eloquence, rhythmic speech which subordinates grammar {Q rrlusic, 
to euphony and harmony or beauty of sounds. In the context of the 
first language we learn that 'in place of arguments it would \have 
aphorisms, it would persuade without convincing, and would repre~ 
sent without reasoning'.+ 
Certain obvious points deserve brief mention. The office of the' poet 
is a priestly office while the eloquence that draws humanity together, 
that arouses, impassions and persuades, is an oracular or magical use 
of the tongue. The first institution, that of poetic speech, is uniformly 
mythic in its qualities and practices. It aligns the first law to reli~ious 
1 For illustration of such it point, see, for example, Sir Philip Sydne~, An 
Apology Jor Poetry (1581-3" 987, Manchester), pp. 103-7, where it is exp~i c itly 
argued lhal poetry precedes law ('the lawyer saith what men have determined') 
and is alone amongsl the arts in improving upon nature. George Puttenharrl, Tlu 
Artt oj English Poesit (1689), pp. 2-4; 'The profession and use of poetry is .most 
ancient from the beginning, and not, as some erroneously suppose, after, but 
before any civil society was among men. For it is writtt:n that poetry was lhe 
original cause and occasion of their first assemblies.' The issue is always that of the 
linguistic basis of order, for only through speech, through poetry and rhetoric 
which are its first practical social forms, can any form of communication. namely 
communis or commonality, emerge. It is to language, to a rhetorical order, that

modes of representation and persuasion, while the first contract- that 
which constitutes civil society - transpires to be more a concession by 
divine right, a hieroglyphically encrypted use of sacral tradition, of 
traditio in its theological sense of custody of the unwritten word, than a 
movement of enlightenment or reason as such. I At various points of 
the Essay it may be observed that the origin is opaque or enigmatic; it 
is hidden and much of its originality is thereby lost.2 The postulation 
of an origin that is hidden and variously described as symbolic, 
poetic, emblematic, oracular and irrational has further connotations. 
It serves to distinguish the savage or primitive, the first (prfflturs) t 
from the civilised and modern.3 More importantly, it serves to 
associate and to bind the characters of the primitive - of linguistic 
figurativeness or seductive symbolics - to the past. The symbolic 
dimensions of words, the delirious rhythms and figures, the elo-
quence, passion and politics of language are all ineluctably bound 
(contracted) to the past. Thereby they are banished from the present: 
its powers of speech are rational and enlightened; they are social yet 
separate from the origins of sociality. In the place of history, the 
search for origins substitutes the sepulchral and repetitive figures of 
tradition; in the place of linguistics it inserts the dead letters of truth; 
in the place of rhetoric it signs the notarial contract oflaw. It d~es so, 
it must be admitted, with every appearance of regret. MUSIC has

has of the written law, for when words are obscure ... we imagine that more was 
spoken than written, and more intended than uttered . . . then the tongue yieldeth

contract includes a tropological connotation of dejection or depres-
sion associated with a secondary meaning oflraho, to withdraw or pull 
out. In its past tense the contract fittingly connotes diminution or 
elimination of the trace or track, of the mark or spoor. Tract or trace 
imply writing; the tract - tractate or treatise - protracts: it treats or 
examines but it also prolongs, defers, puts off, delays. The social 
contract, like its cognates the legal contract and the various other 
testamentary writings or deeds, endeavours to sefid a message to the 
future, to control posterity, to ordain both issues of record (of 
property) and of meaning. In the final instance, by leaving its track, 
its impression or imprint, the contract presents a memorial, a vestige, 
a mark that will endure, that will stand for its sender long after his 
demise. In both a social and a symbolic sense, the contract calls us to 
belong and thereby to survive death or at least to exclude the signs of 
death, those of historical temporality, of a finiteness that tradition 
alone can transcend. By fixing meaning in advance, by deciding the 
forms of interpretation before reading the material text of traditi·)n, 
we are asked by the Contract to keep faith with a temporal charter - a 
particular sense of time as deferral of death - and to belong to a 
specific track, a stretch of text or territory, a space or expanse ofland, 
a region or nation, that will serve as the sign of our identity and as the 
mark of that through which 'we' will live on.

To take but one example, the contract is defined by William West as a 
bond or deed 'whereby any man confesseth himself by his writing 
orderly made, sealed and delivered'. t The confession, we may 
suspect, has the status of serious speech, of iterability, and may be 
approached initially as a matter for grammatological analysis. The 
contraCt is a text or record, an instrument (symbolum) of a special 
status, an authentic sign inscribing in formal terms a legally 
designated object. 
In the material terms with which grammatology is initially 
concerned, the contract as mark, note or grapheme has a dual 
significance. On one hand, the instrument is a 'physical object, a 
symbol in the sense of a sign or token ~hat circulates within the 
institution and according to an economy of writing or politics of 
scriptural accumulation and exchange. In crude material terms, the 
contract is produced by and is by and large accessible to the legal 
profession alone; it belongs [0 a specific textual community and its 
institutional significance should be tracl:d in terms of that com-
munity. On the other hand, the contract is an epistle or note and as 
such is an act of communication; it is not simply a form but also a 
content. As regards the content of contmct, the relevant gramma-
tological themes concern writing and repetition, reference and faith; 
in short, the question oflinguistic content ('.ancerns the rhetorical and 
more broadly semantic conditions under which a particular writing 
systenl becomes monumental and its texts become party to a 
tradition. thereby escaping history to join the repetitive permanence 
of institutional language. We will deal first with the latter issue, that 
of language as the content and so also the condition of possibility of 
contract. I t is an issue that is dealt with most directly in the Essay on the

MEMORY, PRECEDENT AND WRITING SYSTEMS OF LAW 
memory. of keeping faith (fo/tlitas) with the invisible (natural) spoken 
word. The principle· is that of tradition, of a circular or repetitive 
i;}stantiation of the institution in· the nostalgic belief that the divinely 
ordained meaning of words can be kept from history in the custody of 
unwritten law. The shift from speech to writing might equally be 
formulated as a shift from politics to law in which writing plays the 
role of nOle or reminder, a new symbol of a prior bond. What is at 
stake in such a move is both a repetition of the contract in a more 
permanent form and also a vital restriction of the rhetorical domain. 
The two arc closely and surprisingly connected. 
Jean-Jacques emphasises the restriction inherent in the movement 
towards philology and philosophical grammar. The 'restraint' of 
rhetoric is portrayed first as a loss of eloquence and of melody 'which 
began by being no more than an as~ct of discourse, imperceptibly 
takes on a separate existence, and music becomes more independent 
of speech' .1 It is also portrayed, following Tacitus in the Dilllogw, as a 
loss of style, a fettering (auxiers) oflinguistic feeling in philosophical 
reason or a sermonising grammar fit only for 'Ie bourdonement des 
Divans' (murmuring on coucbes).2 Eloquence could be heard and 
understood from a great distance (de fori loin); it could arouse the 
emotions and move to action in a way that is, in Rousseau's view, 
simply not possible in the dead prose of a written grammar. In place 
of eloquence and style which were traditionally the third part or 
division of rhetoric, it is memory (mt'moria) that now explicitly comes 
to dominate the rhetorical scheme of written communication. 
Memory is here a dialectical and didactic instrument, teaching, after 
the manner of Ramus,' the 'truths' ofa discipline, and is no longer the

study of ita own which might well tract a lineage from the 'langue ~p istolaire des 
Salams' and the various other common items or objects 'the meaning of their I 
sending was known to all lovers'. The analytic couch and the murmur of the 
unconscious suggest that the hidden language of the divan might form an 
alternative network, an underground relay, which cannot be as easily separated 
from public discourse as Rousseau implies. For the present, s~ p, Legendre,

argument associated with Simonides and oraI'disposition. 
That memory comes to dominate the new dialectical order of 
written discourse has further connotations, specifically concerned 
with dictating the form of tradition as repetition and recollection, as 
custom (ualuntas populi) and law (lex posita). If we move to look at the 
rhetorical structure of the Conlral Social we would emphasise the 
charter that makes it a secondary contract, which, wittingly or 
unwittingly, Rousseau depicts in the self-same terms that were used 
to characterise writing as coming after speech, namely that both 
writing and law are abstract, generalised, ideational, conventional, 
cold, univocal and uniform. The contract, in other words, has come to 
take a new form as written prose or as an instrument, a symbol or 
symbolurn in a dual sense, one which associates the contract as writing 
both with the act of writing, with the mark, token or graph of 
'symbolaeography' - of contractual writing - and with the symbol in 
its theological sense of creed: the symbol here being interpreted asa 
fonnal authoritative statement or summary of the religious belief of 
the Christian (or some other) Church,a creed or confession offaith. 
In etymological terms, the symbol, and by extension the contract, is 
the sign or mark that differentiates the Christian from the heathen 
and the believer or the faithful from the heretic. 
In linguistic terms, the creed referred to by the etymology of 
symboium lS the order of original linguistic meanings;it is belief in the 
contract of origin in which the order of words was anno~nced to the 
faithful and subsequently maintained by tradition and declared by 
the law. Only by virtue ofa prior agreement as to the reference of signs 
is the social compact, and consequent creation of foundational or 
fundamental laws (lQis Jondamentales) , remotely feasible. In terms of 
writing, we may thus postulate that (here is implicit in the develop·

contract of a linguistic order) I that is not simply the first institution 
but also, by virtue of being first, the modd or prototype of all other 
institutions. In the influential terms of Hobbes' Leviathan, the priority 
of speech is explicit and crucially indicative of the order of sociality: 
'but the most noble and profitable invention of all other, was that of 
SPEECH, consisting of Names or Apptllations and their Connexion; 
whereby men register their thoughts; recall them when they are past; 
and also declare them one to another for mutuall utility and 
conversation; without which, there had been amongst men neither 
Common~weahh, nor society nor Contract, nor Peace'.2 In the 
absence of the divinely ordained order of proper names, the theory of 
the origin oflanguage must endeavour to imitate a lost modd and to 
establish in human speech an order of notes or marks, tokens, 
emblems or signs that will remember, guarantee and recall to phonic 
or graphic representation an external order of reference, be it of 
things, fantasies or thoughts. In structural terms, we may thus 
observe a first - though absent - moment of speech, an archetypal 
instant in which language was called upon by God to name or 
nominate, to refer to an order that God had created and guaranteed 
prior to the attachment of names. 
The natural causes of speech referred to at the outset of the Essay 
are thus more complex than might be suspected. They involve a fallen 
or historical nature? a golden age of savagery· in which a humanity 
expelled from the Garden lives in individual isolation and forgets its 
original tongue: 'the first common tongue [langut commune] died with 
the first society'.5 In place oflanguage various ostensive and gestural 
semiotic systems develop to indicate in a visual manner the contents 
of the mind: 'what the ancients said in the liveliest way, they did nOI 
express in words but by means of signs. They did not say it, they 
showed it ... the most vigorous (intrgttiqut) language is one in which 
the Sign has said everything before one speaks." Heraldic symbols 
and other emblematic or figurative depictions had developed prior to 
speech for the simple reason that the task of any system of notation is 
taken to be ostensive; it is that ofimitating its object or referent which 
is later transposed into that of marking and calling to memory objects 
of a more abstract kind. The principle of composition and function is 
in each case of notation identical. From heraldry to Ila langue·

nature in painting or indeed the more complex musical notacions of 
verse,3 the note or mark identifies a referent, an object designated by 
agreement, by 'Ie concours d'autrui' (by agreement with the Olher)4 in 
advance of any individual use. The lost Adamic pact is replicated, one 
could venture co say, in a generalised semiotic or notanal contract which 
Rousseau locates distantly either in terms of'l'enseigne de leur pere' (the 
tutelage of their father)5 or in the more explicit habitus of the other as 
that rhetorical space from which and to which the sign or letter is posted. 
The laicisation oflanguage is represented by Rousseau in terms of 
the replacement ofa divinely ordained linguistic pact by an originary 
semiotic contract. In both cases the principles of signification) of 
incremental addition to primary lexical;or semic units ofdenotationJ 
are identical: 'most of the root words vrould be imitative sounds or 
accents of passion, .or effects of sense ohjecls'.6 The biblical pact is 
mimicked in the contract or rather in that series of contracts in which 
are agreed the proper notes (the names) of visual, emblematic, phonic 
and scriptural orders. The relationship between those several 
contracts is one not only of functional identity but also of a strictly 
ordered progression from signs [Q notes, from orality to literacy, from 
rhetoric to writing, from natural to positive law or from the invisible

speaks mO!lt passionately by means of signs: 'one speaks more effectively to the eye 
than to the ear' (Essay, p. 22).

may thus be observr:d that that which precedes thr: social is the 
spiritual,directly referred to at one point as 'the homeland [/a patm] 
of the Christian [which] is not of this world'.' The other world must 
be brought down to or dirr:ctr:d towards human ends and for such a 
purpose a simulacrum of the divine order is to be inscituted in the 
fictional form of the state. There can be no doubt that the language 
used to depict the instituting act, the creation of 'the moral person 
which constitutes the State 3.5 a rational being', 3 is redolent of earlier 
theological conceptions of social order and indeed explicitly states that 
'aU justice comes from God, who alone is its source' .. ~ Yet neither 
ju.tiee nor written law nor the moralpersonaficta of the state can claim 
to be copies or mo<lels of the divine. They cannot, without idolatry

bound to an implied instituting term: 'in order then that the sodal

designation of the simulated sourer: of the contract, and specifically of. 
the subject who contracts, observes that 'the body politic or sovereign

equal lack of equivocation 'thr: sovereign power [is] absolute, sacred 
and inviolable'.3 The crucial point is that, while the source of such 
sanctity is external to the social, as nature. unconscious or 'effroi

Prior to an analysis of the contemporary'significanceofthe contract, it 
is worth observing - again in conformity with the earlier depiction of 
the poetic bond - that the social contract also represr:nts a movement 
from rhetoric to writing, from a law written invisibly in the heart (ius)

degenerated, passion has been lost, the government of prose and of

observed that it is far easier to present tradition under the gui~e of 
nostalgia than it is to locate history in its proper place - the present. 
Legal Letters and Social Contracts 
(De Fide Instrumentorum l ) 
The Essay concludes with a brief discussion of the relation oflanguage 
to government in which Jean-Jacques momentarily raises the ques-
tion of how speech relates to popular politics, and philology to law. 
Following certain other readings of Rousseau, we have ~Iaborated the 
thesis that the theory of the origins of language places a linguistic 
contract at the basis of the occidental juridico-pohtical tradition. 
Language is the first contract of sociality, the original bond or 
institution, and it lies therefore at the basis of tradition as its hidden 
source. The implications of the relationship of language to law, of 
speech to norm and of text to institution can be analysed initially in 
terms of the governing relation of rhetoric to writing specified in the 
closing chapters of the Essay. 
I t is the paradoxical function of the theory of origins to invoke a 
symbolical representation of a vanishing point: the ?rigin can be 
presented only in terms of the retrospectively glimpsed last trace, the 
moment where the self becomes the other and the identical broaches 
the different. The logic of such a move is simple and binary: befpre 
life, death; before history, God; before society, nature; before 
language, silence. The antithetical latter terms annihilate their 
opposites; they are points of closure at which representation ceases in 
enigma or more profoundly in articulo mortis, in the founding moment 
of myth. As regards the origin of language, that movement to 
annihilation follows an exemplary pattern. At the origin of language

bdieved because it simply reflects, without translation or addition, the speech of 
its source. The scribe, and in consequence that which is written, is no more than 
the innocently represented speech of another, the author of the law: 'he who writes 
makes himself part of that which is written, by his name and by graphism, but he 
wl'ites as an innocent instituted by the message. He is the hand. Jie is the penon

direct manner than through. faith in God through the intermediaries-
the 'ordinaries' or sacerdotts - of the established Church. I In the 
beginning was the word, bu~ that word was secret, a matter ofinitiate 
knowledge at best availabkonly to the seers, the revcalers, the priests 
and those with the wisdom :oflaw: 
[T]he effect would have to become the cause; the social spirit, which 
should be created by the institution, would have to preside over its very 
foundation; and men would:have to be before the law what they should 
become by means of it ... This is what has, in all ages, compelled the 
fathers of nations to have recourse to divine (du cit'l] intervention and to , 
credit (he gods with their ofn wisdom .2 
Whatever the asserted int~ntion behind depicting the source of the

The originary word is an unwritten word. It is placed in the mouth 
of God. It comes with its meaning attached to it, its meaning being 
prior to its use. It is already contracted, bonded, canonic. The 
rhetorical contract precedes any written law in precisely the same 
manner that each trope ~f progression used in the Essay evokes 
increased civility: signs ~ecome words, feelings become reasons

MEMORY, PRECE?ENT AND WRITING SYSTEMS OF LAW 
contractarian tradition expresses a specific enlightenment project, a. 
particular conception of modernity -of modus, of rhythm, path or way . . 
To pursue the meaning of the cont-ract is to question how the tradition : 
has scripted and circulated the law; it is to question-the codification of 
meaning - its reduction to the contract - and its exclusion of the other 
as alien figure or foreign law, which is, in the last instance, either 'dark 
words' or plain force, the other either as death of meaning or as loss of 
life, either semantic or physical annihilation. That exclusion can be 
formulated in legal terms as a question of privity of contract, of 
belonging, of entering into 'consideration', as against the non-recog-
nition of third-party rights or of a ius quaesitum tertio. The third partY"it 
may at this point be hinted, is the meaning that the contracting 
parties cannot appropriate, that for which they cannot speak, the 
limit of the contract, the end of its life, its last mark, death. I t can be 
simply noted in conclusion that a postmodern account of the 
contractarian tradition, and specifically of the contract as a contract, 
does oat escape the tradition or evade its law. It can do no more than 
hope to add further meanings to the contract and to historicise in a 
supplementary fashion the terms in which the legal tradition presents 
itself as dogma: that is to say, as truth. 
The issue of postmodernity can itself be formulated as that of 
systematically raising the question of how we have been contracted, 
which is to say how we have been made to speak and upon what terms 
we participate in the institutional.text. We will end by reviewing in 
general terms the principal tenets of the contract as writing, always 
noting that here the contract has further connotations as something 
put out. To put out a contract is to send a missive, to advertise an 
intention and equally to threaten with death, to put out a contract on 
someone meaning prospectively to sign his death warrant and by 
extension to sym bolise his end. The crucial relations are here 
temporal and spatial. The contract endeavours co govern the future 
and as writing it seeks to communicate beyond the lifetime of its 
author: the legislator 'should found his judgment not upon what he 
sees, but upon what he foresees, nor should he stop so much at the 
actual stale of the population but rather at that which it ought 
naturally to attain'. 1 To write is to preserve, to delay, to create a 
monument to p·oslerity whereby the simulated figure of the father can 
continue to lay down the law on no stronger ground than that of

tradition: that is the role (o.J]icium) of paternity, that is why the 
contract must be obeyed.' 
To the temporal text can be added a spatial territory. The ·~ 
or 
place of the text is both that of the longul duril of tradition and .the 
space within which it is disseminated.:Z The image of the early 
metaphysics of the book,3 of the symbolical manner in which texts 
were treated, can help elucidate certain of the grammatologicaland 
semiotic issues involved. The book was, in the high Middle Agel, no 
more than a collection of disparate texts which could well include 
charters, donations of land and 'other royal concessions. Before being 
stored in the sanctuary of the abbey, in the chapel or the treasure 
chest, the text would be placed upon the altar, offered to God and 
blessed. It would then be removed to the safest - and most remote-
possible archival space, to a sacred hiding place or sacrammtmun 
lalibula, where, blessed and abandoned, the text would remain fOT 
posterity under the guardianship of heaven. It was, it may be noted, 
an immediate relic surrounded by stone and anathemas and thereby 
it joined immediately the other time of tradition, eternity or myth, 
and the other place of the sacred. the utopia of the sanc/wm .rantIDnfm. 
The text, as bearer of the juridical tradition - as corpws oflaw {ililris} 
and of society (ciuiliJ) - was hidden instantly from time as history and 
removed from polit~cal or profane space. I t remains to argue that in 
the place of the contract of linearity, of eternal progression, post-
modernity implies a notion of temporal intensity; in the place of the 
utopia of tradition, of no place, it indicates a notion of heterotopias. In

MEMORY, PRECEDENT AND WRITING SYSTEMS OF LAW 
prosaic written contract in which belief is transferred from the creed 
to the instrument, and from sound to silent letters. In terms of the 
social contract, we may suspect that law (lu) I itself is now to be 
defined as a derivative of legere, to read, and that the contract is in 
consequence best understood as an indissociable combination oflaw 
and writing, of lawful writing which for J ean-Jacques means cold, 
clear and writ for all time. 
The specific features of the Contrat Social may be dealt with quite 
swiftly, their rhetorical order mimicking that of the Essa). The social 
contract is announced by means of a massive simulation: 'I suppose 
men to have reached the point at which the obstacles standing in the 
way of their preservation in the state of nature show their power of 
rt!sistance to be greater than the resources at the disposal of each 
individual for his maintenance in that-state.·2 There follows from this 
hypothetical depiction of an imaginary historical necessity a further 
passage in which the logical necessity of the compact (pacte social) is 
spelled out in the equally simulated terms ofprobltm and solution: if 
there is such a problem its solution is necessarily as follows by 
impliCation of the terms in which it is ..posed: 'the clauses of this 
contract are so determined by the nature of the act ... so that, even 
though they havt perhaps never heenfonnal!J announced they are everywhere 
the same'.' The principal function of such a simulated origin is that (,r 
hiding and so making sacrr-d the source of tradition and law: 'it is not

I See Legendre (1988, pp. 289-91 ). Law derives from legere to read. That 
something is written is, in dogmatic culture, sufficient proof of its lawfulness; it is 
then binding, both instrument and scripture. S« also E. Benveniste, Lt lIOCabwitJire 
tit! institutiON Indo·EwropitTllJ II (1969, Paris), pp. 267-75. The etymology given is 
based on hidore ofSe..,me. It is possible to make a contrary a,rgument on the basis 
of the Greek verb tegM, to say, from which the Roman legm can also bf! derived. 
Such a derivation links law to speech, or more precisely to declaration. See. P. 
Stein, R,gultu Iuris (1g66, Edinburgh), pp. 3-25. There is an interesting polemical 
discussion in G . Rose, DiDttttic of Nihilism: Post·StnKlu,alism aM Law (J 9B4, 
Oxford), pp. '14-6. The contrary argument, however, fails to take account of the 
textual context oflegal declaration: traditio or oral tradition and authority, as we 
have earlier argued, has always accompanied and interpreted (he written law. 
Further, the law has always been 'announced' but that does not alter the character 
of the tradition itself, on which see P. Goodrich, Reading flu Law (1g86, Oxford),

. 'anybody who can make the gods speak, nor get themselves believed 
when they proclaim themselves their interpreter'. J Only the 'as if of 
the absolute reference can adequately simulate the originary 
moment; the instant of genesis, of otherness, in which meaning is 
forged and the first words, the first notes or letters, are scnt, the first 
contract signed and the first of a series of simulations inaugurated. 
The two crucial moments of such simulation are that of the deferred 
origin of meaning - of the point of the first, the unitary reference- and 
of writing, which simulates the law of origin or, in Rousseau's words: 
'Thus in the task oflegislation one finds two seemingly incompatible 
things: an enterprise beyond human power and, for its execution, a 
non-existent authority (qui n'est ritn].'2 
In positive terms, the simulation ofa point of origin, the postulation 
ofa contract as the source of tradition, suggests a move from the rule 
of God to the rule oflaw, from covenant to contract. The shift is one of 
laicisation rather ,than of secularisation, a change of terminology 
rather than of function: law as the direct expression of God's will, as 
conce.s~ion or donation, is replaced by an apparently positive notion, 
that of reference to a contract, an agreement, a mutual bond upon the 
strength of which a new series ofinstitutional guarantees - of points of 
transmission - can replace an antique Christian order with the 
rational universalities of law . I t is the people, by means of the general 
will, that now guarantee sovereignty, ord(':r and law. It is the people, 
in the split form _of the -contract, that flOW send and receive the 
message of law: the contraCt establishes the two parties to an 
exchange and then indicates the bond or tie that binds them together 
in the form of obligation. We will pursue brieRy the terms of this 
contract by reference to its rhetorical context and form. 
In both historical and linguistic terms, the immediate context of the 
contract is a divinely imbued nature. The state of nature, as it affects 
the contract, is a fallen state in which only the ambivalent memory of 
gen~sis and of Eden can potentially restrict unbounded aggression. It 
is in consequence a split state in which instinct opposes justice' and 
self-interest precludes moral sentiment. There is in such a condition 
no guarantee, no recognised bond of mutuality in God, that will 
preclude either personal compUlsion or general tyranny. In institut-
ing the social, as in instituting language, it is rhetorically evident that 
the ultimate source of the first social action is to establish the human

law of writing that the civilian lawyers had early formulated in the 
maxim dtfide instrumentorum (of the faith that attaches to instruments). 
To keep faith with the instruments oflaw is also to keep faith with the 
contract and with the word or mark by means of which the contract is 
remembered and so binds. In writing (hx posittJL therefore, we have a 
further simulation in which the note or legal mark achieves the effect 
of resemblance: 
[T]he specificity of writing would thus be intimately bound to the 
absence of the father. Such an absence can of coune exist along very 
diverse modalities, distinctly or confusedly, successively or simul-
taneously: to have lost one's father, through natural or violent death, 
through random violence or patricide; and then to solicit the aid· and 
attendance, possible or impossible, of the paternal presence, to solicit it 
directly or to claim to be getting along without it, etc, The reader will 
have noted Socrates' insistence on the misery, whether pitiful or 
arrogant, of a logos committed to writing, J 
Metaphysics of Contract 
The sovereign, by virtue of what it is, is always all that it ought to be ,~· 
The connection between the Essai and the Contral social, between 
language and law, is presented by Rousseau in terms ofa rhetOlical 
structure that moves from the natural to the social and from the 
unwritten to the written, That movement is cast in terms of 
secularisation; in terms, that is, of a movement towards a constituted, 
written, human law which abandons the 'metaphysical ideas' that 
had formerly attached to the concept of a law of nature,3 We are 
presented rather with a definition of the manner in which the self-
sufficient principle of sovereignty communicates with itself, the 
manner in which the body or social corpus identifies (names) and 
manipulates its various parts by means of 'the law [which] unites 
universality of will with universality of object'.4 That process of 
communication involves a relationship of internality: 'when the 
whole people legislates for the whole people, it is considering only 
itself; and if a relation is formed, it is that between the entire object

seen from one point of view and the entire object seen from another 
point of view, without there being any division of the whole',l In 
short, the sender and receiver of the message are one and the same; 
the contract separates the parties to the exchange simply so as to unite 
them indissolubly, textually, legally, That is to say, in metaphysical 
terms, the contract internalises both origin and end. For Rousseau it 
is, however, always a question of the origin or of the first, ofa contract 
which is also metaphysically first, namely which is One or of the One, 
a unity, a canonic referent, outside of which there remain only the 
possibilides of irrationality or death, of that which remains after 
reason or life are gone. 
The principle of self-sufficiency represents the process of communi-
catior. as a circular one: semiotic and juridical subjects alike are 
destined eventually to refer only to themselves, their message simply 
and ceremonially reflecting its origins. its sender. It is possible in 
consequence to observe that within the contours of the contract as 
depicted the possibilities of language, of truth and of law are both 
exorbitant and extremely limited. The realm of contractual com-
munication which structures the possibility of both knowledge and 
law is possessed of the truth - of a name, a referent, a cause - but is 
endlessly desdned to repeat theatrically the signs of that dogmatic 
truth in ever more various veridical and juridical forms, If the 
tradition speaks, it is because it already knows. If the law rules, it is 
becanse it has immemorially designated both the office and the 
referent of such rule: it rules its own creation, it proclaims trga omnes. 
Finally, if the subject of communication seduCt:s. it can only be in the 
sense of a radical narcissism - it is 'our' tradition and it is 'we' who 
love, nationally, patriotically and unto death, Alteniatively, it is we 
who love, but within the prescribed limits and according to law, We 
love but that desire is allowed no better object than that of pro patria 
mon, 
Such is the nature of our contract; it is that which binds us to 
discourse and ties us to the institution and to law. Equally, the 
contract is that which excludes; it is that which immunises us against 
other discourses and precludes that we even think of any other law, 
To pursue the meaning of the contract to its end, to its desuetude or 
death, would be a suicidal venture: by definition nobody escapes the 
institution. The problem is rather an anthropological one: the

the shattering of demarcations and boundaries saggested by such 
temporal and spatial displacements, it implies finally that the internal 
contract of the split self, of the first, of one or origo, be displaced by a 
play of one and other, in which sender and receiver be interrupted by 
the excluded other of the contract, the third party, language itself as 
the endlessly varied failure of presence: 'in the ineffable [insaisissabltl 
instant where it pJays the law, a literature goes beyond literature. It 
finds itself on both sides of the line which separates the law from that 
which is outside the law; it divides the being before the law, it is at the 
same time, like the peasant, "before the law" [devanlla loi] and "prior 
to the law" [avant la loi)'.1 To allow literature to play the law, to refuse 
the immunising properties of writing - of positive law - returns the 
contract to its emblematic or symbolic space: the simulation that 
makes the Rousseauite series of unitary contractual orders possible is 
no more than a metaphor, a symbol in the Greek sense ofa splitting of . 
the self - of the one or some other representamen of Gad - within the 
intf;:rnal space of repression: in legal terms,jiclio,figura veritatis. 
To contract is both to include and to repress (to bury) that which 
cannot he included as part of the system. The contract, in establishing 
the genre of law, acts as an antidote to other discourses. The written 
law comes to represent the idea or ideal whereby original and image, 
real, and imagined, inside and outside, conscious and unconscious, 
society and nature, take their places within the tradition. We receive 
the tradition 'in the normal course of the post'. The contract, as was 
observed at the outset, is binding once posted, once placed in the 
hands of the state messengers, or passed over to what Legendre terms 
'les messages.messagers'.2 When literature plays the law we are 
entitled to expand the invocation of the postal rule determining the 
formation - the communication - of a contract. The emblem of the 
postmodern contract would be that of the undelivered letter, of the 
letter that does not arrive or, in terms of Thomas Pynchon's Tilt 
Crying of £0149,3 that joins the other, the alternative postal network. 
shown accompanied by candles and torches, thus did the ancient mystagogues 
show their law to the faithful [Jam.::)'.

'P,'nchon'sfiction is concerned with what is left once the contract has 
. gone, when we are left only with the underground relay, the other 
, postal network, that of the repressed, of what has been left to one side 
or thrown within. Tht Crying depicts a modernist society (America) 
as a social form that is closed to the outside world and at the same time 
inwardly petrified. Governed by the contract, by law, it is immune to 
life and rejects all forms of dialogue. It is sclerotic and so maintains 
itself through the explusion oflife: it places life on the outside with the 
waste, the refuse, the dispossessed, the inarticulate, the other, the 
trace. Life is condemned to expend, to squander· itself on the other 
side, formlessly. subterraneanly and buried from sight as refuse or 
waste, The refuse may also, however, refuse. It may form its own 
network of communication, and it is largely in the name ofthe other, 
of that which remains, that the heroine Oedipa pursues the signs and 
clues, the marks or traces, the dross outside the contractual network, 
as indices of an underground postal network. The emission and relay 
of the repressed. of WASTE, the silent transmission oflhe messages of 
the disaffected, form the object of a fictional detection. J The book ends 
by leaving the question of the underground postal system un~ 
answered, the last and undelivered letters of the tradition unopened 
-posu rtStanu. It may be hallucination or it may be there; at all events 
only the fmure will decide the existence, the coming to being, of the 
other, of the underground relay buried within law's body. 
Pynchon, at p. 71: 'Oedipa wondered whether at the end of this (if it were 
supposed to end), she too might not be left with only compil(d memories of clues, 
announcemenu, intimations, but never with the central truth iudf, which must 
somehow each time bf: too bright for her memory to hold; which must always 
blaze out, destroying its own message irreversibly, leaving an overexposed blank 
when the ordinary world came back.' Compare Derrida (1980. p . .s8): 'Once 
inlercepted - a second suffices- the message no longer has any chance of reaching 
any determinable person, in any [dlttrmin.2hit] place whatever. This has to be 
accepted, and I accept [j'acCtptt]. But 1 recognise that such a certainty is 
unbearable, for anyone. One can only deny this self-evidence, and, by their 
function, those who deny it most energetically are the people charged with the 
carrying of the mail, the guardians of the Jetter, the archivists, the professon as 
well as the journalisu, today the psychoanalysts.'

Haida, the COUTt was not prepared to countenance their argument

The apparently emotive example of legal deafness presented in 
Wuurn Fortst Products Ltd v. Riclulrdron and Others is at its most 
profound level an example of a deep structure of common law. It 
exemplifies an habitual logic oflaw, one which throughout its history 
has systematically obliterated difference in all its manifestations, in 
all its discourses. Like the inquisition, and the 'ordinaries' of the 
Counter-Reformation, like the Church which has historically dther 
annexed or destroyed the other, the logic of the common law has been 
one of a comparable lack ,of alternatives, of a refusal to recognise that 
vast host of the other: the outsider, the stranger, the vagrant, the 
marginal; the I rish, the coloured, the foreign. What is their place in 
the law, what is their voice, whose language do they use? In its 
immediate linguistic technology, the case is in fact a vivid illustration 
of the procedural peculiarities and stringent evidential rules of 
relevance and admissibility that pertain to all forms oflega) dialogue. 
Routine hearings for rent. arrears, repossession of goods bought on 
credit, unfair dismissal, maintenance, breach ,of the peace, social 
security appeals or incompletely performed contracts exhibit identi· 
cal disparities between expectations of audience arid Ihe reality of 
routine processing of c:Iaims before tribunals and the lower courts. As 
is reasonably accurately artic;ulated in popular presentations of the 
legal community, the law, both as an institution and as a profession, 
represents itsdf as an arcane and elite pursuit; its image of a language 
is that of a peculiarly legal reason, that ofthe logic of rules, and its 
forms ofuuerance reflect the idiosyncracies, the obscure presupposi-
tions and the generic inaccessibility of a language that is 'learned' in

exclusory, namely that the language oflegal communication is not a 
vernacular usage but rather a closely guarded and professionally 
governed specialist register whose lexicon and syntax reRect the 
historical inftuence of two alien and one obsolete, specifically legal 
dialects,) Against the background of that history it should be borne in 
mind that before any lawyer is equipped to lestreat recognisances', 
lescheat' property, pass 'fee simples', attend to 'res judicata', counsel 
in 'voir dire' or plead 'ex turpi causa non orilur actio' they 'have 
applied in excess of six years to the acquisition of the language and 
t~chniques of the legal register. As the case of the Haida Indian land 
claim well illustrates, however powerful the arguments or cause, 
however justified the case in terms of natural justice or moral 
competence, it is unlikely to be to the advantage of the laity to speak 
fCif themselves in legal settings; they are unlikely to be heard. More 
specifically. they cannot be heard in the sense that any recognition of 
the vernacular, and of all [hat the vernacular implies in terms of 
values and references, would place the court in a position ofrelativity; 
the language of law would itself become just one more dialect, one 
more register or code, a further vernacular to be weighed in the scales 
of legitimacy. In purely pragmatic terms, the vernacular must 
therefore efface itself and the non-legal speaker learn through that 
erasure of voice to benefit from complicity in the community of.legal 
language, a complicity Ihat takes place through representation and 
lc<iges ~oth civility and fate in the hands of the profession. 
It is to that profession and language, to the complex particularity 
of a legal audience, that the present Chapter will [urn in endeavour· 
ing to outline certain of the more salient. features of listening in legal 
settings. Throughout our theme wiiJ be that, irrespective of the aura 
of rationality and of specialism that surrounds legal hearings, they are 
best depicted not in terms of the law's own image, that ofimpartiality

mainland British Columbia. Lyell Island is the largeSt of the group 
"and has been inhabited since before the Dutch andsubs.equent British 
discovery and colonisation of western Canada by the Haida Indians. 
The island is covered by primordial forest and its traditional economy 
is based upon woodcraft and fishing. In early Ig85, without 
consulting the inhabitants of the islands, the government of British 
. Columbia granted a logging licence to an American company, 
Western Forest Products Ltd, to exploit the islands for lumber. By a 
; variety of means which included inserting metal spikes into the trunks 
of treeS and a non-violent blockade, the Haida Indians prevented 
.Western Forest Products Ltd from commencing logging. On 6 
November 1~5 Western; Forest Products Ltd issued a writ naming 
. the president of the Council of Haida nations, Chief Richardson, as 
. defendant in an action for an injunction seeking to prevent any further 
interference with logging on the island. The case of Western Forest

sians to public spaces: buildings variously store information, hier-
: archically arrange communicational relations, separate and align 
visual axes, strategically facilitate the administration of their occu-
pants and above all, in Foucault's terminology, construct and 
constitute 'enunciative modalities'. 1 The latter-concept refen to the 
fashion in which social discourse or discursive formations are tied to 
parlicular sites and roles, bound to specific institutional ~ttings 
within which specifically delimited subjects are socially authorised to 
present a qualified specialist speech. The enunciative modality 
determines both what can and what should be said within a particular 
form, that of, for example, a lecture, a political speech, a sermon-or a 
judgement, as well as delimiting the context and conditions of its 
reception and appropriation in, respectively, the lecture theatre, the 
hustings, the church or the courtroom. Intrinsic to such enunciative 
modalities is not simply an analytic space but equally a physical 
architecture which both delimits and contributes to the symbolic 
effect of carefully regulated genres of speech. The building hosts and 
echoes the semantic import of discourse ~hile also strategically 
facilitating and administrating its subjects.2 
On the portals of the court buiLd.ing will be inscribed the · royal 
mouo, 'Dieu ec mon Droit', while in other regimes it would be 'Fiat 
Iustitia' or some variant thereof. The windows to the buildings are 
likely either to be barred or to be somewhat higher and narrower than 
is usually the case: the building does not see out, it is blind to the 
outside like an archive or a bunker, its reality is exclusively within. 
Access to the rear of the building will be likewise barred and the 
entrance to the courts will be in some varying measure imposing not 
simply by virtue of its sile but also by dint of its elevation from the 
street. Whatever the form it takes, and the degree of emphasis or 
imposition is likely to vary according to the date of design and the 
status of the courts within the legal hierarchy, the threshold to the 
court building will be marked and physical access to the seats of 
justice will involve bmh a visual and conceptual ascension from the 
quotidian street to ritualised space. That the situation and external

·served on the Haida made reference> as was until recently 
standard form for common Jaw writs. to the 'grace of God' (Dei graM); 
Chi<f Lightbrown and others retold at length the mythological 
history of the Haida arrival in the islands. God, whom they referred to 
as the 'Great Spirit and Creator' had granted the islands to the Haida 
at the beginning oftime for their use and occupation. They had a right 
'to stand on the islands' and to act as caretakers from that moment at 
the dawn of time when the first Indians had emerged, according to 
Haida legend, from a clamshell carried by a raven and dropped on the 
sands of the islands. 
A series of further anecdotal narratives, teUurian mythologies and 
traditional poems were presented to the court as evidence of the 
ancestral claim of the Haida to the islands. Several Haida artists 
explained at length the character and symbolism of their art forms, of . 
their totem poles, masks and carvings. all of which spoke to the 
integral relationship of.the Haida to the land, of their love of it and 
respect for it. They had been there since time began; this was their 
land by custom, by the prescription of use, by precedent even, yet 
ironically they were threatened by a Common law writ and a property 
right that ran only to a hundred or so years. And it was a writ, let us 
say, that had neither history nor art nor poetry, nor even the logic of 
common law memory, to protect it. After the island had been 
reduced to stumps by the modernist anti-aesthetic of the loggers, the 
intruders would leave but the Haida would remain to inhabit what 
was left of their destiny and their island. They would have nowhere 
else to go. Of the other anecdotes and histories presented, the most 
striking occurs towards the end of the evidence when one of the 
women elders sang traditional songs to the Court for a full afternoon. 
The songs repeated ancestral legends and evidenced again that, in 
Haida custom and art, inhabitant and nature were one; that as 
occupiers of the islands the Haida do not differentiate themselves 
from their environment but rather see their culture and community as 
being inextricably and intrinsically bound up in the land. She ended 
her songs weeping. Chief Richardson concluded his defence by appeal 
to natural justice, to a law of nature, an ethics, which he argued 
ifW..e&ted the Haida cause with a spirit of truth that pre-existed and 
would long survive any ruling as to meTe law. 
The testimony presented to the court was extremely novd in legal :. 
terms. It took the form of symbolic dress, mythologies, masks and 
totem poles as well as the legends. stories, poems, songs and other

of interpret~tion that such art and mythology implied. The 
anlulne;nt was both lyrical and visual, narrative. and aesthetic, and it 
far beyond the contours of contemporary Western 
'qa.ngual~esoflaw, although the defence- perhaps simply as a matter of 
respect and most frequently in response to judicial questioning - did 
also include more prosaic forms of argument as to Haida customary 
law of dispute settlement and land claim. Unreserved I judgment was 
· gi~en by the court the day after· argument ended. Justice McKay 
· observed that the court would not normally have allowed argument of 
the political kind heard but that, in view ofthe fact that the Haida had 
no other arena available to them, he had ~en prepared to listen and 
generously recommended that a record of the evidence presented 
· should b< kept for posterity. Thejudgment itself was extremely brief. 
The evidence presented as to the Haida title to and relationship with · 
I the islands was not legally r"elevant to the case being heard, which 
simply concerned interference with a valid logging licence. In law it 
,was simply a matter of the wrong forum, perhaps ofJorum non conveniens 
too, and he had no alternative but to grant the injunction. He 
.. proceeded todo so while absolving himsdf of any m.oral responsibility 
by remarking in time .. honoured form that 'while people sometimes 
think that judges have the power to do what they want, they must in 
fact act according to law; they administrate the law but cannot make 
policy'. Of course, this moral self-absolution of the court, this washing 
of hands, had as its underside the annihilation of the opposing 
language, the non-legal language in which the defence had been 
~ conducted. That language was annulled in the simple, direct and 
· brutal sense that it was not even referred to save as a curiosity. a rdic, 
a primitive remnant of a more savage past. The court would not , 
., compare mythologies, it refused even to countenance Ihe question oftht 'othtrJ, , 
because to do so would raise questions of its 'seIr. of the social and 
mythic construction of its own body, its social role and actions, its

The social distance and unfamiliarity of the courtroom within

bench and its agonistic or gladiatorial character lends an atmosphere 
of the classical games in the amphitheatre, in which the Emperor 
decided life or death from a situation above the arena,and in the form

The books of the law run to many volumes. If one includes the full 
panoply of historical and contemporary law in force, together with the 
synopses, commentaries, doctrinal and procedural writings, updates 
and treatises on method, it runs to many libraries.'.l It is a literal 
impossibility to know the law, and even if one expended an entire 
existence in legal repositories one could only ever know part of the 
law. While much law is available in literary form to those trained in 
the art offinding and reading it, it should also be observed that many 
decisions are not reported and that many that are transcribed are not 
published but are available only in court libraries to which the 
judiciary alone has access. Even were one to accept for the sake of 
argument that the physical availability oflaw rendered the majority 
oflegaJ.rules accessible, in a broader sense the unequal distribution of 
legal knowledge gives the profession or community of lawyers an 
inevitable advantage or superiority in the forms and utility of legal 
discourse. In both linguistic and rhetorical senses, dialogue before the

The image of law as a pre~cminently rational enterprise, as the 
, inexorable application of axiomatic rules, is predicated in the main 
upon doctrinal systematisations of statutory law and the reported 
decisions ofa very small number of higher courts. It is primarily upon 
the strength of textbook studies of a relatively small number of appeal 
" court decisions - most notably those of the High Court, the Court of 
, Appeal and the House of Lords - that notions of the certainty and 
completeness of legal regulation are derived. Invested with a high 
. 
of public visibility and symbolic prominence, those courts 
inspire the mythology of legal certainty and of the mystery of legal 
presence which textbooks reformulate for didactic educational pur-
poses without ever evidencing either the necessity of the decisions

A not guilty plea was entered on the record, no attempt being made 
the court, the clerk or magistrate to establish the grammar of 
phrase and so to separate the two themes. In another relatively . 
obvious example of reformulation I the defendant is concerned to 
ignore the specific wording required by the court as formal pleading, 
in view of a legally ulterior purpose to the discussion:

to that strategy of formulaic and definitional control in 
,ul)Sequ,enl discussion, the principal discursive operator in court· 
room dialogue is undoubtedly that of paraphrase reformulation. 
. Paraphrase, of course, may involve either a relation of equivalence or 
substitution between elements (words, expressions, 
,proposi.tio,ns) such that the elements a and b 'mean the same thing' in 
relev,.nt discourse, or a relation of implication or orientated 
,:,Ub"littltabil.ity such that the relation of substitution 0 to b is not the 
as the relation b to o. t It is the latter form of paraphrase that is of 
':gr,eatest discursive and ideological significance in two respects. 
the choice ofimplication will organise the meaning attributed 
statement; secondly, the content of that implication is not 
'e.:pli,cit but depends upon a pre-established discourse and meanings 
not necessarily equally available to both parties to the

~ pc:rtinel,t implications. 
most explicitly and significantly orientated types of para-

statement, by lexical or referential means, in legally and often also 
. morally opprobrious results:

archaic and sacral atmosphere of special functions and the silent 
unravelling of other times. 
Semioticians of architectural form have tended to distinguish 
between the 'formal' and 'material' syntax of buildings. I The formal 
syntax of buildings , as the linguistic metaphor suggests, is concerned 
with the study of the formal properties of the built environment: that 
is, with the geometry of organisation which may be reduced to (i) sets 
of items or formal properties of spacei (ii) sets of relationships 
amongst these; and (iii) a set of rules or laws obeyed by the latter. In a 
necessarily simplified account, the fundamental issue involved in 
formal syntax is the study of the 'empirical overall style' through 
which the built environment communicates by organising visual 
relationships, symbolising subject positions (placements) and 
controlling avenues of circulation and visibility according to 
generally functional criteriaJ be they those of devotion, (panoptic) 
surveillance, isolation J communion or some other alternately disci-
plinary or hedonistic design.2 As an adjunct to formal syntax J 
material syntax concerns the study of a set of rather more necessary 
features to the surface of buildings, the materials used, textures, 
colours, scales, modulations and insignia that range from gargoyles to 
heraldic crests. 
Summoned by writ, subpoena or condition of bail, even before 
arriving at court the subject of legal proceedings will have already had 
to-traverse the linguistic complexities of what were until recently 
archaic and verbose standard legal forms of interpellation that 
variously invoked God and monarch and threatened sanctions affine 
or imprisonment. The subject is called and arrives in the iIl-
demarcated open hallway of the courts to an atmosphere of hushed 
routine efficiency of business combined with a confusion engendered 
by a general absence of clear indicators either of the order of 
proceedings or of where the relevant court is sitting. While lists are 
displayed, the order and placeofproceedings will generally have to be 
explained save in the case of defendants in custody who either arrive 
under police escort or are brought from the sparse environs of the 
court cells up to the lavishly contrasting well of the court. At this point

'genelcal:isation becomes difficult in view of the diversity of courts and 
arrangement. Viewing and listening positions will also vary 
markedly ·according to the role that is to be played within the 
: proceedings. While there are significant procedural and architectural 
facets to the roles of juror and of witness - the latter, for instance, with 
. the exception of expert witnesses, are not allowed into the court until 
. they are called to give testimony - I will limit my remarks to 
defendants. 
The strategic organising principle of the courtroom is a didactic 
one. It is that of the visibility of justice rather than of its audibility. 
The ritual character of proceedings in court have, first, an obvious 
material character in the higher courts in the form of the ceremonial 
dress of legal participants, in judicial robes and wigs, barristerial 
gowns and wigs, the use of royal red and emblazoned royal arms on 
and frequently also above the judicial seat or throne. To the aged 
pomp of the furniture and scale of the courtroom can be added the not 
altogether incidental features of procedure and address. The 'court' is 
silent and rises to its feet upon the entry of the judge. The judge is 
addressed never by name but either in metonymic form as 'the court' 
or 'bench', or sacrally as 'your honour', 'your lordship' or 'your 
worship'. I t is not a human being, in other words, that sits when the 
court returns to their seats but rather justice (jus) and law (lex) that 
take their place at the pinnacle ofa strictly ordered hierarchical space, 
surrounded by a veritable debauch of symbols of majesty and order. 
The sitting is accompanied by a strictly controlled order and tone of 
speech: speakers are called upon to speak and cannot do so 
volitionally, nor is it in general possible to interrupt that order and 
decorum. The court must remain silent and indeed obedient to 
procedure, with stringent sanctions attaching to the common law 
offence of'contempt in the face of the court' which punishes any who 
'scandalise' the court in praesenlia, while the powers enacted in the 
Contempt of Court Act Ig81 not only create wide-ranging offences of 
strict liability but have also on occasion been used to imprison 
observers or participants who have done no marc than laugh in court. 
In an interesting discussion of genres of discourse, Mikhail Bakhtin 
observes that where discourse performs as authoritative discouf3c it 
no longer performs as infomlation, direction, rules, models and so 
forth but rather strives to determine the very bases of our ideological 
interrelations with the world, the very basis of our behaviour. In this 
respect we encounter the authoritative word:

process of-reformulation and annexation would involve an account of 
the historical development and disciplinary techniques of legal ,: 
textual culture, its use offoreign languages and its exemplary forms of 
rhetorical organisation, that far exceed the boundaries of an account 
oflegal auditions. I It remains true, however, that courtroom speech is 
underpinned by many of the more general and manifest inequalities 
of relationship that exist as between legal discourse and non·legal 
discourses within the development oflegal language as a whole. In 
terms of legal dialogue, the 'imagined community' of the legal genre 
as an administrative discourse evidences its discursive power through 
an. explicit superiority of attitude towards and exclusion of other 
discourses and usages. Authoritative (professional) languages 
demand, as was observed above, an allegiance on the part of their 
listeners which accepts the authority of the language as an inert and 
indissoluble whole irrespective of its content. That authority is linked ' 
initially, or at leut most obviously, to a specific political power, that 
of sanction, to an institution, the courl, and to a person. the judge. [n 
a less direct but easily apparent sense, linguistic authority is manifest 
in the imposed forms of dialogue and silence and in the irrefragable 
truth oflegal definitions that variously annex, reformulate, appropri-
ate or exclude competing usages: 'what is important [in relation to 
profession~l languages] is the intentional dimensions, that is, the 
denotative and expressive dimension of the Hshared" language's 
stratification. It is nOt in fact the neutral linguistic components of 
language being stratified and differentiated, but rather a situation in 
which the intentional possibilities of languages are being expropri-
ated.'2 The intentional possiblities of utterance are annexed and 
reformulated in a particular direction and with a particular content 
that conforms to the specific objects, belief systems, forms of 
expression and value judgments of the relevant profession. For the 
speakers of the language, the reformulation involved is directly 
intentional whereas, for less powerful outsiders to the given purview, 
the intentions permeating these languages become 'tltings, limited in ' 
their meaning and expression; they attract to, or excise from, such a 
language a particular word - making it difficult for the word to be 
utilized in a directly intentional way, without any qualification'.'

of definition, annexation and reformulation endemic . to 
,di:.lo,guc between legal and extra-legal genres, this discussion will be 
to a more · manageable analysis of examples drawn from 
~ dial,oglJC in the lower courts. The examples will be loosely arranged 
according to the order of proceedings.· [n each instance the concern 
· . will be with the explicit manifestion of an image of legal community 
· and sovereignty at the expense of other usages: that is, with the 
subordination of the listener to an imposed form and to purportedly 
pre-established definitions. By way of introduction to the pre-
· ,ponderant number of examples, drawn from defendant's responses in 
Magistrates' Courts, it should be noted that prior even to the initial 
courtroom scene of entering of a plea defendants have likely been 
subject to considerable pressure in relation to their plea, in terms 
either of informal plea bargaining or of straightforward persua3ion to 
plead guilty,' 
The initial stage of criminal trial takes the form of pleading. while 
in civil cases it generally takes the form of a statement of claim and 
counter.c1aim. In both cases, though markedly less so in civil 
proceedings, the initial speech in the proceedings will be legally 
formulated and will concern neither the events nor the perceived 
wrong at issue, but a legal category and definition of offence or civil 
claim. The question posed win concern not issues of what was done, 
why it was done or the contexts and motives ofits doing, but simply 
the legal statement of charge to which the defendant must reply either 
guilty or not guilty. The discursively interesting aspect of this initial 
ritual oflegal recognition is that the statement of charge or wrong may 
well appear so irrelevant to the actions concerned that the option of 
pleading guilty or not guilty is perceived either as peripheral or as 
coercive. Its function, however, is largely one of recognition and 
submission to the arena of trial, as the following examples from the 
Magistrates' Courts well illustrate. The fir.st case2 involves a charge of 
trespassing with' intent to steal: 
Cltd: Do you plead guilty or not guilty? 
Dtjendant: Well, yes and no. 
Clerk: Do you plead guilty or not guilty? 
DtjeruJant: Yes - I was guilty of trespassing - and no- I wasn't intending 
to steal.

In the context oflegal dialogue it should not, therdo.re, be as:,urnee 
that the -annexation of non-legal dialects is universally successful 
unopposed. In an example again drawn from Arrears 
Maintenance, I the defendant recognises yet ironK:aUy €haUenges

M: Wen if you flatly refuse to accept the order of the court there's only 
one alternative - then you'll go to prison.

The reformulation in the above examplel is legally an effective and 
frequent one. The implication adduced is by no means a necessary 
one; the positive assertion could equally imply mistake as to the 
identity of the goods, as to the identity of the accused or as to 
certification of payment, and it certainly makes no necessary 
attribution of motive with regard to the police evidence. The further 
implications of the reformulation also draw upon the moral credi-
bility of the police as routine witnesses in courtroom dialogue and the 
further legal implication that, ifthe character of witnesses is attacked 
by the defence, the character of the defendant can then be placed in 
issue. The process of reformulation thus acts to control the topic of 
discourse and to particularise a generic account of behaviour in a 
damaging yet, for the unrepresented defendant, unforeseeable 
manner. In the following example,2 the defendant has explained at 
length to the Arrears and M~intenance Court how, after two years' 
unemployment, he has recently found employment again: 
MagiItralt: In other words what you'r~ r~ally saying to us is that you 
started to wake up to the fact. 
Dtftndant: Yeh. 
Magistrate: That uh you've got certain obligations to me~t and it's vitally 
important that you should start to think about them - that', what 
you're saying J take it. 
Dtftndant: Yeh.

"teek? 
Dtftndant: Oh yeh, yeh I do accept it. 
Clerk: Vh - are you really asking that uh some of these arrears be 
remitted - is that what you're really asking? 
Dtftndant: Yeh. 
The defendent's simple description of two years' unemployment 
followed by a short period of self-employment is reformulated by the 
magistrate into a set of moral obligations and motives of legal 
relevance which the clerk proceeds to translate into a further 
acceptance of a specified amount and period. of remission of arrears.

Aligned to control of topic in the form of paraphrase and definition 
can be added a series ofrules of relevance, prohibition of hearsay and 
admissibility. The ability to negate or to challenge adverse para· 
phrase and damaging implications depends throughout upon know· 
ledge of their relevance. their preconstructed force within the legal 
form of discourse, and the status and credibility of the wi mess or 
respondent. An interesting contrast in status and the power to 
reformulate can be explicitly seen in the following examples. The 
firstl is a rape trial: 
Dtftnce: When you first saw him he was in company with another man 
and you approached both of these men? 
Complilintr: No. 
Dt/tnct: And talked to them? 
Complaintr: No. 
Dtftnet: And that was at your suggestion that in fact, you went up this 
close in the first place? 
. 
Complainer. That is ridiculous, utterly ridiculous ... no. 
Dt/lna: Was it not the case that the man in the dock did talk to you at 
some point in the street and ofTer to walk to wherever it was you said 
you were going? 
Complainer: How could he possibly do that if he was in .. . Road? 
Judgt: Don't argue with counselj at the moment all wtwantJou to do is to 
answer the question. 
Complaintr: No. 
Note the connective 'and' in the defence's questions, implying as they 
do a connection or continuous logic to the discourse of the defence 
despite the assertion of (he precise opposite in the complainer'S 
replies. The 'and' connects the monologue of the defence, it connects a 
discourse that ignores the dialogic implicatures of the exchange and 
retains a cohesion through simply denying the dialogic character of 
questioning. When the judge intervenes it is also noteworthy that a 
'we' is invoked that can only refer to a complicity between judge and 
defence established against the complainer - after all, the defence 
could easily have been instructed to ask relevant questions in the light 
of the answers given. The second example2 of an even stronger 
exclusionary power predicated upon an accusatorially conceived 
concept of relevance may be briefly elicited from proceedings in the 
Magistrates' Court. Two youths are accused of suspicious activities

A semiotics of law studies all the different means by which law is

English language but in Latin, French and Middle English, an 
archaic form of English itself. The language of law, however, is only 
one medium of transmission of law. The fact that the language of 
English law is in many aspects a foreign dialect indeed indicates that 
it is unlikely to be widely read outside the profession. The texts oflaw 
are thus likely to have symbolic rather than an immediately semantic 
- i.e. linguistic - content. For a semiotics ofLaw this point is crucial. It

manipulation, then the ability to challenge the legal control of topic 
and terms is primarily a matter of contesting the discursive 
preconstruction of questions. In general that ability will depend upon 
access to the 'shared knowledge' which acts as the precondition of the 
propositional content of the statement. In legal seltings it also 
depends upon a knowledge of procedure and conversational forms as 
well as a more general capacity or confidence that will allow the 
respondent both to question or oppose legal dialect (the community of 
legal language) and to risk the possibility of sanction. 
The question of the accessibility of legal preconstructions to those 
without the linguistic community of lawyers is amenable to a 
relatively swift answer. At its most general level, the discourse of law 
is that of an authoritative prior discourse which for the bulk of its 
history has been encoded either in an alien language or in an archaic 
register of the vernacular. While the function of that restricted coding 
is primarily that of authorising particular speakers or enunciative 
modalities - irrespective of the specific content of their speech, as is 
most obviously the case with a lay magistrature wh.o are forced to rdy 
upon legally qualified court clerks for esoteric points of law - a few 
comments may also be passed on the general semantic features oflaw 
as prior discourse. Restricting the discussion somewhat, the over-
whelming empirical evidence is to the effect (hat the language of stat-
ute, precedent, jury instructions and argument on points of law is 
inaccessible even to those non-lawyers with several years' experience 
of higher education. I The available tests of comprehension are by no 
means precise but the CLOZE test j to take one example, is considered 
an adequate measure of comprehension for commercial, educational 
and publishing purposes. The test simply involves the deletion of 
every fifth word of a text which then has to b. completed by the 
respondent. In tests conducted at Loyola University, Los Angeles,

· on to the rather more vivid Flesch scale, an educational test based 
word and syllable counts, legal documents fared even worse. 
Flesch criterion of minimum 'adequate comprehension is a score 
of plus 4-0. Amongst the documents tested, the trust clause from a 
1983 federal case scored minus 55, a 1982 Vocational Education Act 
scored minus 83, a 1982 Social Security Act scored minus 132, while 
the winning score of minus 219 went, not entirely inappropriately, to 
a 1976 Ethics in Government Act. 
Whatever the variations in reliability of the tests used, the general 
conclusion is that legal documentation, as a reservoir or lexicon of 
pre-established meanings within the discourse of law, is satisfactorily 
proven to annul ordinary discourse '- in the .case ofa score ofminu5 
219, it . does . so to the point of absurdity. In considering the 
significaace of such data for the analysis of legal dialogue and 
specifically of audience, two further observations pointing in a 
contrary direction are pertinent. The first is . that tests of com-
prehension are generally based upon lexical and syntactic features of 
discourse and do not directly test comprehension in terms of'gist' Of 
effect. In that respect it is interesting that, when Charrow and . 
Charrow tested jury comprehension of formally drafted instructions 
in M,aryland by means of a paraphrase test, the fact that they scored 
between 4.5 per cent and.54 per cent did not preclude the conclusion 
that in the overwhelming majority of cases, even where the 
instructions, were clearly not understood j the jurors! inventing their 
own meaning for the instructions, acted (unwittingly) within the 
spirit of the formally drafted instructions. The point is an interesting 
one in terms of the assumptions to be made with regard to listening or 
viewing positions more generally. The second qualification of the 
results summarised above concerns the degree of acquiescence that is 
to be imputed to audiences. Recent important studies of audience

and then the Normans, allows for some interesting observations as to \ 
movement, boundaries and ethnicity, I Just as the language of the 
common law was and is a much·traveUed heteroglossia.just as it is at 
the very heart of its insularity foreign, so also we should recognise 
that, as a language, law doc:s not refer to any anterior realm oflegal 
things; it refers simply to the system oflegal notation, to other signs of 
law, to other legal texts. 2 In this sense, if we wish to think oflanguage 
and law, or of signs and law, we can do so only through recognition of 
the difference that constitutes that language or system: the language 
oflaw is a language that is subject to law. that is a servant to lega.l 
forms of reference, to the rattle of juridical definitions in the form of 
arbitrary yet obligatory reference to precedent texts.3 The law is a 
form of writing, but it is also a form of speech. In both instances it is 
necessary to understand that at the heart of the legal t~xt (graphic or 
phonic) lies a foreign body, an alien -or nomadic meaning, the 
I Thert is an extensive debate on Englishness and law, which ranges from 
popular assertions of lhe need for a break with Rome and with tincture of 
Normanism to eulogies of the antiquity and excellence of a peculiary English, an 
eternally English,law as found by Sir John Fortescue, for example, in D, lAvdibus , 
ugwn Anglicu; (1737 edn): 'I am convinced that our laws of England eminently 
txcel, beyond the laws of all other countries . . " (p.64), or again in D, Polilic(J

contrary is not to be said nor thought, but that the English customs are very good, 
yea of all other the very best'. Coke, pt VI, Z2a, makes the argument that 'if the 
ancient laws of this noble island, had not excelled all others it could not be but 
lome of the several conquerors and governors thereof, that is to say the Romans, 
Saxons, Danes, or Normans, and especially the Romans ... would have altered or 
changed the same'. Sir Henry Spelman, The Ongi1l4t o/tilt Four LAw Tmnso/tht Y'(Jr 
(16.1411695, London), p. gg, marvels that Coke did not realise that such was 
precisely whallhe Romans, the Saxons, the Danes and the Normans had done: 'I 
do marvel many times, that my Lord Coke, adorning our law with so many Rowers 
of antiquity and foreign learning. has not yet turned aside into this field (that of 
foreign taw] from whence so many roots ofourlaw, have of old been taken and 
transplanted. ' 
2 The point is elaborated well in Pierre Legendre. L 'Empire th Id I1mti (lg83. 
Paris), p. 103: 'aesthetics further teaches us this: truth is a place, by hypothesis an 
empty place, somewhere where there is nothing, ifnot for texts. We constantly re-
encounter this point, b~cause ifdogmatics has a constant theme. it is in relation to 
a truth which is resident precisely in texts. Reference is reference to texts.' More

in short of its being read against itself, illicitly or in a 
. supplementary manner. The formal procedure of this chapter will be 
one that moves from a specific system oflaw to a specific report and 
attempts no more than a depiction of those two ideal entities in terms 
of their visible presence, their attachment to objects and places, to a 
text and to a language. The order of movement will be from structure 
to speech, from place to position, from plastic elocution or iconic form 
to the order of its representatives, its subjects. 
The Iconography of English Law 
Take as a starting point the notion propounded by one contemporary 
philosopher that we 'recognise' law in much the same manner that we 
;ccognise a language even if we have no conscious grasp of its 
grammatical rules. The question is, what is it that we recognise, with 
which we are familiar or at ease? At the level of greatest generality, it 
can be suggested that what is recognised initially - both in historical 
and psychological senses - is Englishness, a particular systemic 
context, a specific system oflaw tied to a unified sense of geographical 
and national-political identity, It can be suggested thus as a point of 
departure that we look precisely for an identity, for that which 
differentiates common law from other laws, the law of a nation (ius 
'.lmmune) from the law of oat ions (ius gentium). The answer is likely to 
be found in the language and particularly the imagery in which the 
common law establishes itself as a tradition, as having a separate yet 
identifiable history, an insular and unique sense of the past. Only 
once we have identified the clements of that sense of the past, of that 
time out of mind which is also time immemorial, the basic source of 
common law, can we endeavour to understand the nature of the 
English constitution or the character and colour of English law. 
In virtually all its pre-classical definitions, the word 'law' - as, for 
example, halachah, shanta, Dike or dharma - refers either directly or 
incidentally to the path, the way or the road: the law is the order of our 
going; it is (he map, the compass, the route taken across a landscape, 
the direction by which we find the next encampment, I The common

provoke a Breach of the Peace, or whereby a Breach of the Peace may 
be occasioned.' What is to be constructed as behaviour intended to 
occasion a breach of the peace is pre·eminently a matter of value· 
judgment concerned with norms of interaction, the justification of 
behaviour, the reasonableness of responses and the semantic import 
of an 'insult'. In the case in question, two men 'cuddling each other 
and kissing each other' in Oxford Street at I.SS a.m. were found guilty 
of the offence of insulting behaviour intended to provoke a breach of 
the peace and were bound over to keep the peace. On appeal to the 
Divisional Court of the Queen's Bench Division befo~ Justice 
Glidewell, the decision at first instance was upheld on the strength of 
the legally sanctioned reasonableness of the reaction of two other 
couples: 
Two couples were walking along the south footway of Oxford Street. 
First there were two young men about twenty-one years of age [AB) and 
second two young women of a bout twenty ... The case finds that the two 
young men appeared not to notice them (the defendants] but the two 
young women stopped opposite the defendants and one of them raised a 
hand to her mouth and both of them ran up to the two young men [AB). 
After a short convcrsation one of the girls pointed at the dt.fendants who 
were still cuddling ... Both of the young men [AB] thcn walked towards 
the defendants and one of them shouted: 'You filthy sods. How dare you 
in front of our girls?>i 
While the issues involved in Masttrson were pre-eminently political 
and m~ral (and as such will form the basis of the analysis in the next 
chapter), doctrine has always sought to separate such issues from the 
putatively normative sphere of legal argument. Although the pre· 
dominanr categories of legal argument and judgment concern 
broadly drawn and necessarily changing notions of reason, fairness 
and justice as the criteria of interpretation oflegal rules, and despite 
the didactic epithets of approval and disapproval that ground the 
majority of judgments, challenges to that legal pedagogy on forms of 
behaviour and lifesty!e must take the form of extra-legal, political 
protest and lobbying. To be heard in court, arguments must be 
reformulated in the abstract legal terms of the case, presented on cue 
and subject to the potentially censorious intervention of the court. By 
way of conclusion, it may be noted that resistance to the legal 
imposition of order and forms of argument in court is generally

That history centres around the ch.-.nging role and presence of the

legal direction that they have received from the judge. One such 
instance would be the earlier~mentioned case of R. v. Ponting, where 
the judge had at one point in the trial threatened to stop proceedings 
on the ground that no legally relevant defence had been presented to 
the charge laid under the Official Secrets' Act. In the event, the jury 
· acquitted Ponting in the face ofajudicial summing. up that had made 
· it quite clear that in law the defence presented had to be disregarded. 
In the more recent American case of State of Massachusetts v. Allain, 
CaritT, Clay and othirs,l a defence of necessity was pleaded to a charge of 
~ disor·de .rlyconduct and trespass. Students were charged in relation to

Intelligence Agency recruitment techniques on American campuses. 
defence of necessity involved arguing that the misdemeanours 
comll,i·tted were justified on moral grounds as being necessary to

the CIA were not a party to the case and that much of the defence

interesting in that it represents the first reported occasion on which 
defence of necessity I which has been regularly ruled out in nuclear 
protest cases, has been allowed. It is unlikely that its

The rights and liberties symbolically affirmed in Magna Carta are , ' 
all subject to the law of the earth, of the realm, IIX terrae, which is 
nothing other than the judgment of the king as justiciarum regni, as 
maker or voice of the law. In that respect even rights as fundamental 
-that is to say, as ancient2 - as the writ of habeas corpus (who has the I

defeasible. In Dame['s Case the writ of habeas corpus was of no use in

inheritance, the antique laws, the birthright of our land: 'quae ex pink maxima ItgtS

other example, Henry Finch, LAw, or d Diuoum Tlurwf in Fovr Books (1627, 
London) establishes the antiquity of the source as being on the one hand 'time out 
of mind', brute age, but also and significantly links Ihat disappearance into the 
immemorial to the aura of Ihe divinity: 'positive laws are framed in the light of 
natural law and reason and from thence come all the grounds and maxims of the 
common law, for that which we call common law, is not a word new or strange or 
barbarous ... but the right term for all other laws' (Bk I, fol. 74-5) '

I We are left with an image offreeborn and gentle, and indeed natural, 
. L-nglishness which is notable less for its antiquity than for its 
insecurity: the ancient order is an order of vassalage, of dominium 
and service, a feudal order in which every" subject is a tenant of the 
Crown and liable, when the realm requires, to serve and to die for a 
soil that is not his or her own.2 
Ifwe return to the question of the iconic unity oflaw as that which 
we recognise when we first recognise law as being our law, the image 
is of old England, an England that is eternal: it is our environment, 
our landscape, our nature, both mystical and thoughtless. It is at one

English line, t.he nistory of the exclusion or repression of all forms of 
foreigness, even (or especially) when such foreigness is in our midst 
as language, as conqueror or, indeed, as royal family. In a secondary 
sense, the internal character of ~he history of the English is a product 
of the fact that it is not a considered or explicit history; it is nature in 
the sense that it is given and indisputable. What is English, be it law 
or any other institution, is first and unquestionable. The history is 
therefore something that can be assumed; it is internal in the sense of 
being inside all true English, all free English, mystical and inexplicit. 
In the end it is a family history, a history of a domestic constitution, a 
constitution that is unwrinen because gentlemen do not need to put

sign, as a symbol and as a word in its copious particularlity, The 
followed will be that of an analysis of a specific legal system, 
dear, vile England, of the common law, and of a specific text, a . 
case in public law. The theme to be pursued in this particular 
is that of the politics of the legal text: what is this language that we 
law; what is this speech that lasts longer than non~liturgical or 
legal annunciation; what is this place, this text, this mouth, 
which law speaks; who speaks when law speaks? To answer 
que"stions will take us into the realm of what is technically 
legal grammatology: that is, the rcalm oflaw as a system

Ench(Jnted Glass to suggest the eXtent to which the monarchy as 
pervades the national consciousness, and its unconscious as well. 
Taken from surveys in the late 19605 and the 1970s, we learn that 77 
per cent of Labour (socialist) voters would retain the monarchy ('the 
royal family does no harm)' 50 per cent of the unemployed would ' 
retain the monarchy, over 50 per cent of the population believe that 
God took a special interest in England, ~that God guides this country 
in times of trouble', and finally over a third of the population has 
dreamt about the royal family. The statistics can be added to th.! 
other indices of a quiet but obsessive national concern with the 
Crown. with its omnipresence in public life, and the question to be 
posed is that of how serious that pervasive regality is in terms of the 
constitution of our laws. 
In a perfectly literal sense, the Crown heads the constitution and is 
the author of our laws: it is the Queen in Parliament that is the 
constitutional legislator, the sovereign body. Parliament is opened by 
the Queen, the Queen's speech announces the legislative programme 
and the government itselfis the Queen's government, a government 
appointed by the Crown and terminable by it as well. If we move to 
the text of legislation itself, the preamble of every statute takes the 
form of the words: '.Be it enacted by the Queen's most excellent 
majesty, by and with the advice and consent of th<: Lords Spiritual 
and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, 
and by the authority of the same .. .'. It is interesting that the 'upper 
house' is the House of Lords, where by virtue of a principle of 
heredity, a principle of pure genealogy, peers of the realm -- which is to 
say of the Crown's jurisdiction, of the rtg(Jlis - both spiritual and 
temporal sit as of right, and as of birthright, to legitimate the 
enactments of the Crown's government initiated from 'the other 
place'. The key 10 an undastanding of the significance, the absolu-
tism l ofa monarchical and wholly pre-revolutionary constitution does 
not lie in the literal manifestations of monarchism, in its 'Ordinariness 
or iu triviality I but in the impossible and unspoken realm of everyday 
power that circulates alone lines of force that emanate from the 
throne. Let us continue the list, but now in terms of symbols that refer

. attributes of that body, its mystic members. its offices and honours, 
statuses and creeds do not, cannot, die either. To adopt a classical

. honour, do not d::'!, though we may certainly die for them: we may die 
fin an office, for a country, for honour, for a mask. 
What descends most immediately from the Crown is the system of 
honours and of political privilege. In addition to a complex system of 
inheritance of title and honour, of status and wealth, there is also and 
crucially the continued creation of new honours lists: the reward for a 
life in politics is the conferment of anyone of an infinitely varied and 
nuanced hierarchy of honours, of dignities and estates that stretch 
from simple membership of the royal court, to the various orders of 
merit and Empire, to knighthood, baronetcy, peerage and hereditary 
peerage, to the greater estates of Viscount, Earl. Marquis and Duke. 
These are estates and offices that do not die; they are the members, 
the limbs, of an eternal or mystic body, part of old Englandl of 
England as tradition and as class; they are part of our gentility. our 
status, our honour. The hierarchy of honour, of an honour that 
speaks, that pervades all aspects of cultural and institutional life, from 
products manufactured 'By Appointment to her Majesty the Queen'2 
to the Queen's awards for industry, to the innumerable titular 
directors and titled members of company boardrooms, to the 
ennoblement of members ofthejudic.ary and the right of Law Lords 
to sit in the upper house as a court, as a club and lastly as a political 
body. Finally, consider how ttis precisely those people. who belong. 
most immediately to the political system and who have thereby the 
power to change the institutions and the constiqJtion, to introduce 
some element of reality, of democracy, who are precisely those who 
stand the greatest chance of preferment or privilege through the 
honours list.l They have, in a word, a vested interest in that

law does not differ in its desire to map both a territory and a history, 
the same time to provide a path, a series affixed points across a 
(lex terrae), and also to indicate a conceptual lineage, to. trace ' . 
genealogy or indicate an origin and a line. In this very generIc sense, 
the qualities of Englishness and so of an English law are well , 
established: the common law is the law of the land, a fusue law 
rural types. Despite innumerable conquests, the English law is sacred' 
and stretches back to the halcyon times ofKhg Arthur, to Cornwall, . 
to Camelot. 1 t can be traced also beyond the time of memory, beyond 
the imaginings of ' the best historians', I to an originary time and a lost 
place, the place where dwell the vast hosts of the dead, the ancestors. 
The time of the law is constantly specified as that of an dent custom, a 
time of inheritance, antiquity and establishment about which we ' 
learn through the arcane and wise books of the law. Despite 
Greek, the Latin and the French, which even Coke recognised 
elements of legal language, these books and their disparate 
ledges are said to have survived all the invasions of En gland and 
perpetuated the ancient realm, the sccptred isle, the im,mec~\Or'ial " 
knowledge. 
. : 
The legal knowledge with which we are here concerned is th~t of an 
English law which enshrines the particular national code, an', 
inheritance that is closer to nature and to divine law than any other 
existent system of laws,2 It is the law of the land, of old England, a 
land peopled by the freeborn, by the gentle and honest, by justice a~d .. 
juries, by liberties and the continuity of immemorial custom, ltS

For Coke indeed the antiquity of the common law is so apparent and well 
attested that the books and records, the annals, 'need not the aid of any historian' . 
[pI VIII, L3a-b] . Elsewhere we find both King Arthur and King Brutu'l as 
. 
first English Kings, as the originary authors of our law. Thus, referring to the 
Mirror of justictJ, he remarks that 'in this ancient mirror you may also clearly . 
discern as far as the reign of the often named King Arthur, the great anti'~uily of 
the officers and ministers oflhe common law, and oflheir inferior courts' (pt IX, 
C2a). The reference to Brutus 'the first king of this land' is in Reports, II, 81 a. For 
more popular expressions of similar sentiments see, for example, The Englishman's 
Right (1680, London) .

the geography of the court: the Royal Court is based in LeiMan,

elsewhere, it has sat away from London, as London in the praviinces. 
What the Court takes with it is the awful logic of the centre, 
English tradition, the custom of the realm, which is of course 
custom of the Crown, Consider again that English is first a lalogua,~e 
and second a law, the common law. Immediately prior to the era 
when Sir Edward Coke, Sir john Davies and others were forging the 
records of the English legal tradition and creating the secular myth 
the common law, Richard Mulcaster, Henry Peacham, Thomas 
Wilson, Sir Thomas Elyot and others less well remembered were 
nurturing English as the national and the best of all language.2

geography of correct linguistic usage. You:

as the courts follow the Court, English law follows the English

custom, a series of conventions transmitted through an

with the better classes, the better educated, with the honourable and 
the gentle. just as the court has its place, namely London, so the 
people have their places with 'every man in his room of honour 
according as his J-lace requires' ,2 The distinction of blood, of 
breeding, of genealogy, has been as important as, possibly more 
important than, any particular behaviour: 'the distinction between 
gentle and ungentle, [is one] in which there is as much difference, as 
between virtue and vice'.3 It was the lawyers in the main who 
systematised and spelled out the system of honours, of manners, of 
proper speech and ofsociallaw,4 We can learn from them, The system 
of honour depicts or better represents the various forms of ancestral or 
acquired nobility, As Sir john Ferne defines it, that nobility is derived 
as. a word from the Latin nobilitas, which in turn has a root in TU)SCO, to

unwritten constitution also because domestic agreements. are outside 
the law; they are irreducible to law for the simple reason that no one 
would wish to jeopardise the harmony or honour offamily agreements 
by taking them to court, just as it is still the case even today that no 
one can threaten a marriage by taking a husband to court for rape of 
his wife. I The question remains as regards the constitution, whose 
body, whose family, .which line? 
The authors of the ancient tradition are quite explicit: the 
constitution is one of 'regulated monarchy' and, as Coke also puts it, 
theerown is the hieroglyph of all our laws, Ifwe turn to the icon itself, 
the licit representation of our nation and of our national legal system-
the two are .inseparable2 - it is the monarchy that paradoxically 
coheres both the identity of our character and the unity of the national 
legal system. The point is one which has been made variously in 
historical terms through the analysis of the corpw mysticum or undying 
royal body and its various forms ofportraiture,3 while in the specific 
terms of the common law as it exists today, there is the exhaustive and 
excellent study by Tom Nairn4 of the quintessentially monarchical 
character of the historical and contemporary English constitution .. 
What he also makes abundantly dear is the dependency of the 
national psyche, the media, the communications industry, tht: entire 
fabncof social placement and personal differentiation, upon one icon, 
onc family, one Crown. Ifwe move now to examine what it is that we 
belong to, what constitutes our culturc and OlIr law, before we read 
any individual text, it is the monarchy that will emblematise the space 
oflaw, the depth of structure, the waking and the sleeping dream. It is 
precisely to a monarchical culture that we belong before we read; it ;~ 
from that culture that we make our decisions as to interpretation and 
contractual intention, a parole contract is binding, even though consideration is 
lacking - the word is enough.

.. state with each judgment our allegiance to a literal Englishness; to an 
identity that excludes all consideration of any other culture or any 
other way. 
The elements of an unwritten constitution can be listed with 
rdative brevity. The key to the English constitution - to how we 
'stand together' (con·slatuere) - is precisely that it is unwritten, that it is 
tacit and traditional; it is law as dharma, as way or path or road, as a 
manner of doing things, as good. form, and not as an idea or ... dialogue 
or even as anything to be thought about. In that sense it is pure 
tradition and can in consequence be understood only by those with a 
head for the symbolical. To begin the list of elements we should thus 
note that precisely at its head, as the pinnacle of the constitution, is 
the monarchy. Not a day passes without news of the monarchy in all 
the media: it may be deemed trivial but in quantitative terms there is 
an irrefragable significance to the circulation of one symbol, of one 
icon, of one family, of what we are as represented in the comings and 
goings, the doings and sayings, the court news and the state functions 
of the royalty, the royal family. The search for an identity could thus 
well begin with a statement of the obvious: the constitution as it exists 
today was primarily the product of the arrogation of the powers of the 
Church to the Crown in 153~' The monarch became both spiritual 
and secular sovereign, Leviathan twice over, the inerasable and· 
singular image of a national legal system that had broken with Rome 
and with the Roman Church. Law, as the frequently misread 
philosopher John Austin had no hesitation in specifying,1 was best 
defined affectively as being no more nor less than the command of the 
sovereign: a command that could be positive and direct or could take 
the more subtle form of adoption of existing law or tacit command in 
the form of the judgments of the sovereign's judicial representatives. 
As regards the realms of adoption and tacit command, we move 
· into the realm (the regalis) of the unsaid or unstated ofa legal system 
that has accumulated or found law far more often than it would claim 
· to have directly devised it. Law as tradition depends upon the notion 
that what is established requires no further or no rational justifica-
tion; it simply belongs, it is there, part of the system of symbols that 
constitute a legal identity and system oflaw. Insofar as it is surprising 
· and could be amusing, we can borrow some statistics from Nairn's

continuance which the law bestows upon the name of authority, the 
name of the Crown and its essentially feudal demesnes and domains. 
Much if not all of what is done, in terms of appointments and 
institutional and political decision making, bears some relation to 
that system of monarchical culture, even if it requires either inside 
knowledge or extensive archaeology mixed with intuition to discover 
quite what that relation is. We will return to other aspects of that 
symbolism. Ifwe remain in search of the regalis, of the Crown in public 
or abroad, we must look to the courts. In onc ofits earliest guises [he 
court was the Royal Court, it was the Royal Household or 'the body of 
persons who form the [sovereign's] suite or council' and accompany 
the king's person on its constant journey through the kingdom and 
other possessions. I As curia regis (coram rtgt) it was also the first court of 
the common law, though the notion of the court as that which follows 
(he Crown, as a suite or contitlUance, provides a useful insight into 
both senses of court, as sites of etiquette and decorum in their proper 
senses - that of ceremonies of court - as well as being sites of judgment 
or mercy, preferment or punishment. The court follows the Crown; it 
is peripatetic as part of the royal entourage and later itinerant 
through delegation: the provincial courts and assizes are simply the 
Royal Court 'sitting elsewhere\ the king's person in its capacity of 
body politic rather than natural being. 
That the court is the Royal Court sitting in the absence of the 
monarch does not in any sense preclude the presencing of majesty. 
The labyrinthine structure of the Royal Courts of Justice amply 
indicate an architecture of place, a pageantry and regalil y that 
constitute in the most direct of senses a plastic elocution of an iconic 
authority: the name of the law is to be found endlessly repeated in the, 
alternative space and the other time of the court.2 Consider th<: iconic 
spiritual money of Monarchy: a coinage which, though now distributed by 
governmenu, owes it.! real value to the Royal source ... Through ennoblc:menl or 
recognition the symbol world constantly repenelrates reality, re-transforming it

aura of its furniture and gargoyles, in its inscriptions and devices 
(crests and arms), in its modes of dress and of address, and finally in 
its terms, its moments of appearance and disappearance, of sitting 
and of dissolution. The list could be indefinitely extended but our 
concern is with that panoply of symbols that exist to create a legal 
place, a space of law, of legal annunciationl in which a discourse 
becomes solemnised, a language approaches a li[Urgy, and the signs 
are aU there to indicate the distances necessary to a place, the 
distances that will allow the judge to speak in the mask of the Other, 
to speak innocently as a mouth of the law.2 The places are mapped 
according to criteria of ascension and both physically and verbally all 
points look up to and are directed towards the bench, upon which, 
after the ushers have demanded silence and respect, it is the Law that 
sits down in the place of merely human demands. Consider too the 
forms of dress, the apparel of justice,3 the order of its coming and

Retain the notion that, while status is known by a vanety of 
outward forms or signs, the content of breeding, blood or honour is 
enigmatic; it is itself esoteric knowledge protected by the ver~1 symbol 
that proclaims it. While nepotism may no longer be so obviously 
related to family or to upbringing, while its forms may be marginally 
more diffuse, the system has hardly changed. The unwritten constitu-
tion simply symbolises the tacit character of our governmental 
arrangements and of our law-making elite. Government, like every-
thing else genuinely English, is something arranged behind the scenes 
and according to the orders of esoteric knowledge, The domesticity of 
the constitution operates thus according to a simple law ofmclusion 
and exclusion: the brute distinction betwern 'them and us' is precisely 
what differentiates the establishment from the hordes of the g'Overned, 
the knowledgeable from those whom jurisprudence has generally 
termed the 'ignorant majority', the well spoken from those, who are 
not well spoken.s The unwritten constitution spans eq'jally the 
political and legal domains. It establishes a power that is both 
unknown and nomadic, a moving target in that the generic secrecy of 
the institution means inevitably that for every success in eliciting 
information countless documents disappear, oral culture reasserts

itself, archives sink without trace, new laws of secrecy are passed or 
old laws are exorbitantly enforced,] 
The two principles of English constitutionalism, those of 
monarchism and secrecy, of an aura or display of power that 
simultaneously hides the logic of its practice, can be traced without 
difficulty or too great a degree of digression into the common law 
itself. The aura of majesty that is put in place by the architecture of 
the court, by the placement of the judiciary within the courtroom, by 
the direct ennoblement of the judges, by the appropriate modes of 
addressing the bench, by the order of speech, by the rules of evidence, 
by costume, pageantry and language, all these display the makings of 
a liturgical, legal setting. These are the servants of the Crown, they 
issue their writs by the grace of God and in defence of the faith and in 
the name of the Crown; their space is the regal space of the Law, Like 
the constitution, the Law that they carry is unwritten, it is custom, it 
is tradition, it is ius non scriptum, unwritten reason that can be 
terroristically applied as and when the judicial memory of the 
immemorial or of 'time out of mind' happens circumstantially to be 
activated, The notion of 'time out of mind' describes legal method 
most exactly: it is time unbound to any object, free of any specific 
temporality, a time of repetition and so a thoughtless time; it is the 
delirium of the institution which unravels itself within the discrete 
confines of the legal form, as a prisoner not of life but of normative 
governance. In that respect the delirium of the institution hallucin· 
ates standard forms of procedure and norms of usual behaviour on the 
strength ofhalf':remembered arguments,2 through the dazed recollec-
tion of unreported cases or largely forgotten conversations. These 
were the tools of the common law; these were their memories, a 
communis opinio, a collective memory, as law. The hallucinating mind 
is in strict terms a mind that wariders, that 'lucinates', that goes 
astray. That is the source of common law, of unwritten law; it is the 
meandering of the legal mind, a tempdral and geographical

the traditional place of courtship, it is where young lovers meet, it is 
where the enamoured embrace overtly in public - as opposed to the 
darkened back row of the cinema or the back seat of a car or the 
relative seclusion of the park bench. It is, moreover, where Simon M. 
and Robert C., 'wholly unaware of other persons in the vicinity', 
happened to cuddle and kiss each other on the lips: 'then, the justices 
find, Cooper rubbed the back of Masterson with his right hand and 
later Cooper movt':d his hand from Mastt':rson's back and placed it on 
Masterson's bottom and squeezed his buttocks. Cooper then placed 
his hand, on Masterson's genital area and rubbed his hand round this 
area'. (40g-h). 
Here we must compare geographies, those of the city and of the 
body, different zones and so too, it transpires, different fares.' There 
are also two different forms of transport involved, public and pubic, 
that of the omnibus and of the erogenous. If we are seriously to 
investigate what was happening in this text; namely what it is that is 
reported, then the issue is precisely that of this double geography. 
There are innumerable questions. Think of a few in relation to each 
issue. The scene of the crime was a bus stop. There is a night service 
provided by London Transport - part of Oxford Street's business - so 
groups, the office, the factory, or the home. At the level of practical interest, the 
members of the queue are interchangeable, they are mere instrumentalities of the 
city: for 'isolation becomes, for and through everyone, for him and for others, the 
real, social, product of cities' (p. 257). The individual at the bus queue is a 
participant in an instrumental rationality, an absence, an interchangeable point 
of conductivity, exterior to himself and to the other members of the queue. In the 
final analysis it is the bus that defines the queue, the object that lemporalises and 
locates the place, the space, pf the queue: 'the object takes on a stru.cture which 
overflows its pure inert existence; as such it is provided with a passive future and 
past, and these make it appear to the passengers as a fragment of their destiny' 
(259). In using the bus stop as an emotional space, in breaking down the isolation 
of the queue, in turning not the back but the face to the other, in ignoring the 
anticipatory temporality of the queue, by refusing simply to wait, by refusing to be 
defined by the object, the lovers in Mastmon threatened the instrumentality of the 
city and its segregation of the group. Consider finally Sartre's friend Paul Nizan, 
AdtnArabie, 'you think you are innocent if you say "I love this [man] and I want to 
act in accordance with this love" but you are being revolutionary. BesiC:es your 
love will not succeed.' 
1 The magistrates had bound each defendant over to keep the peace in the 
sum of £100 over twelve months. A season ticket on London Transport between 
Clapham and Oxford Street was a.t that time £120 for three months. What are the 
respective pleasures? 
The Enchanted Past: A Semiotics of Common Law 
237 
was there a bus coming? Did the defendants know of any bus? Were 
they waiting? Is the time of the offence, the breach of the peace, 
related to the likelihood or the regularity of buses coming down 
Oxford Street? The Justices had, after- all, remarked that 'quite 
different criteria apply to behaviour at a bus stop in the street than 
apply to behaviour in a gentleman's public lavatory' (4IC-<1). And 
Glidewell LJ remarks generically that 'every decision must be read in 
tho: light of the [geographical) facts on which it is based' (43c-d). So 
we might note that a decision in relation to an Oxford Street bus stop 
cannot be assumed good even of other types of stop or station: would 
the decision have included behaviour at a railway station, an airport, 
the docks, an underground station? 
We might note also that the map of the city that the' case presents 
also includes the route, the relationship between the Magistrates' 
court and the scene of the incident. The one contribution ofShit':mann 
j. to the text is to remark that 'this type of case in my judgment is one 
peculiarly suitable for decision by the justices. They are the ones 
sitting at Marlborough Street who are most likely to know what is 
insulting behaviour at I .55 a.m. on aJune morning.' As Marlborough 
Street is considerably closer to Oxford Street than are the Royal 
Courts of Justice on the Strand, it can only be assumed that it is the 
geographic proximity and so 'street credibility' of the magistrates at 
Marlborough Street that is their attraction. As to the geography of the 
body, it is a question not so much of when the transport comes, as of 
how far can one go? Glidewell LJ concludes by stating: 'So it comes 
back to this. Was it conduct which within the ordinary meaning of the 
word could be said to be insulting? ... Overt homosexual conduct in 
a public street ... may well be considered by many persons to be 
objectionable, to be conduct which ought to be confined to a private 
place' (<<c-d). The erotic geography of the body is implausibly 
asserted to be a private one and, while it may exist only by virtue of 
the relation of a private eros to public space, to others, it is also an 
inevitable part of the imagery of the street. In that respect even a 
judge could surely recognise that the private, the erotic, the body as 
sensation and as desire, is thoroughly manufactured by public goods, 
by symbols, by prohibitions, by law both violated and remembered, 
by the touch of the other, the gaze of the other, the knowledge 
transmitted by others. How many buses, one could even ask, carry 
advertisements displaying variously attired erogenous zones? How 
many newspapers blowing as rubbish along the Oxford Street

in Thorpe v. Makertl, to take a geographically extreme example, a clerk 
of the King's Court was urinated on in Fleet Street on his way to 
Westminster, in the company of other men of the court. In the writ 
issued. a utnirefacias, the trespass charged was stated as having been in 
presencia curiae. l 
The point of that little history, however, is larger than is perhaps 
apparent: all aspects of the honour of the court and of its aura are 
protected: what cannot be geographically charged as contempt in the 
face of the court can be indicted as scandalising the court in absentia. 
The emblematic image, the reputation, the representation, of the 
court and of what occurs within it is rigorously, not to say 
draconianly, controlled. Nothing can be published that would be, in 
the eyes of the court, prejudicial to any civil or criminal trial. Their 
vision is often surprising and it has been held, for example, to be 
contempt for a lawyer to show documents that had been read out in 
open court to an invr.stigative journa:list, even though the journalist 
could have obtained a transcript oflhe tria1.2 It has been held more 
recently that publication ofinformation that was already in the puulic 
domain could be a contempt of court.3 Further, 'any act done or 
writing published calculated to bring a Court or ajudge of the Court 
into contempt or to lower his authority, is a contempt ofcourt'.4 Thus 
any adverse criticism of any aspect ofa trial, ofajudge, ofa court, ofa 
verdi'ct, is potentially in danger of meeting the strictures of the law. It 
is to be reported, in other words, according wand in its majesty. It is 
to be reported reverently, darkly, emblematically, for such are the 
characteristics of the institution. They are also embedded in :ts 
language. 
Behaviour at Bus Stops; Queues and the Manner of a Case 
The motive question that underlies any extended disct.ssion of the 
iconography and symbolism ofa legal order is that of the context ofa 
specific linguistic and textual practice of law. The questivn can be 
broken down into two parts. Firstly, there is a metaphysical question,

a question about how law hangs together: if the road to law is pathed 
with images offaith, of specific loyalties, of allegiance, of an ancient, 
honourable. and continuing order, then is it reasonable to expect the 
language oflaw - the language of oath swea·rers and of notaries public 
- or the practice of judgment to be free of such iconic and symbolic 
dimensions?l Put differently, we might argue that law is a form of 
representation, that it is as it is represented. At the core of its 
representation is language, at least in the structural or architectural 
sense in which law can be defined adequately as legitimate social 
speech: can we then expect that the language used in such legitimate 
speech will represent differently or escape the lyrical irrationality, the 
murderous arbitrium, of the monarchy and its common law tradition? 
A second mode of asking the same question is more obviously 
practical: reading is never innocent and so what institulions, what 
honours,· what images of reverence or of sacrifice, what other texts, do 
we bring as legal readers to the object being read? Can we remem ber? 
The aura of majesty that surrounds the legal system, the symbols 
and tokens of regality that lead the individual to the appropriate place 
and the appropriate perspective or attitude, to a hegemonic place or 
even style. should not be too easily dismissed when it comes to 
questions of reading the law as a professional, as a lawyer. Indeed, if 
we pay even glancing attention to the history oflegallanguage, there 
is little room within which to deny the symbolic character of both 
language and text as they have existed to represent the law. We could 
even usefully pose very simple material questions as to what and, 
more importantly, where are the books of the law, the libraries, the 
archives that store the traditions of the common law? What demotic 
access does the populace have to such places or storehouses?2 Even if 
the materials of the positive law, the texts and the speech, were readily 
available, of what usc would it be if the words used aTe separate from 
ordinary language and can only be understood, only properly exist, 
within the discrete thesaurus of the legal tradition? The tradition is

however, it is part of the argument of this chapter that there is unlik.eiy. 
to be a need for any extensive revision oflhis chartor grid. In that 
common law operates according to a logic of repetition, the 
struction and mapping of its elements, its structure, is unlikely 
differ greatly in formal terms from case to case. The institution, as 
4 depicts it, institutes itself, it discovers and passes on the established · 
norm. 
Our reading of the case has already been elaborately introduced in ;" 
terms of the geography and manners of public places; the legal sites of " 
certainty and of security in the public course of circulation have been 
canvassed. The details of an alternative reading of the casc, of a : 
supplementary reading again'st. the text, have thus already been set 
out. We now need to fill in the more formal means by which such a 
reading or interpretation can be represented persuasively by 
reference to a variety of linguistic and symbolic dimensions of the 
chosen text and the narrative of security or insecurity, of zones, that it 
supports. 
The overall movement to which our reading will subject the text is : 
an apparently linear and historical progression depicted horizontally 
in row 4 of Figure 7.1 as the teleological movement of the textual 
narrative from the institution to the instituted, from the geo1erality of 
Ihe law to the particularity of its implementation, from the normal 
(the reasona ble) to the correction of the abnormal. I f we take up the 
last formulation, it is easy also to invoke an argument as to the 
circularity of the text: the institution institutes a generalised 
normality, it applies rules, it exacts a standard from a particular 
behaviour, it abstracts from the night, from Oxford Street, from a bus 
stop on the route of the 88 from Clapham to Tooting Mitre, the 
permissible zones of touch, the proper role of the body on a 'footpath' 
in a metropolis. The movement from I A to 4D is a circular onCi it is a 
question of a variety off arms oflegal abstraction, both of a taking·out, 
a removal like that of a tooth, and 9f a variation in levels of generality: 
what is read in the text as section 54. subsection 13 of a specific statute 
becomes in iconic terms a question of sovereignty, of sources onaw, of 
the statute as an emblem of a cuhure, something that we wear, that we 
inhabit, a portrait. 
The terms orthe analysis schematised in Figure 7.1 are rdatively 
simple. The horizontal rows represent a list of functions: that of 
instancing or particularising, that of inscription or rewriting the text, 
that ofintertextuality or of establishing, possibly co!=rcing the relation

to other discourses, and finally tfiat of outcome,-of restating d~e 
,,,,,,ituti,onin its various forms, and on a particular occasion. Starting 
I A, we will follow the terms of the reading already· begun and 
the question not of who is involved, but of where are we, in which 
in which law, properly speaking, in the space between"the line"s of 
book, of what report? We start with a section ofa statutory text . 
. Section 54, so far as material, provides: 
Every Person shall '..Je liable to a Penalty not more than [level 2 on the 
standard scale], who within the Limits of the Metropolitan Police 
District, shall, in any Thoroughfare or public Place, commit any of the 
following Offences" .. '3" Every Person who shall use any threatening, 
abusive, or insulting Words or Behaviours with Intent to provoke a 
Breach of the Peace, or whereby a Breach of the Peace may be 
occasioned ... 
That statute is a choice on the part of the prosecution and also on the 
part of the court; there "are numerous other public order offences, 
including the Public Order Act 1936, as well as a variety of residual 
:, common law offences of indecency and immorality that lie in the 
power of the coun as censor of moral values and as keeper of public 
conscience. 
Position 2A concerns the inscription of the statute in relation to a

is itlO be read? The precise inscription will determine, or at least 
is likely 10 be indicative of-to signal ahead - the outcome of the case. 
, In this instance, the textual inscription does precisely that: the I839 
Act is distinguished from non ~metropolitan legislation on breaches of 
the peace through use of the verb 'may'. GlidewelllJ observes: 
I note in passing that the wording of the offence under the 1839 Act uses 
the word 'may' have been occasioned in relation to the question of 
breach of the peace" Grammatically it should be 'might' though nothing 
turns on that, bUI in Ihat way the section is to be distinguished from the 
similar offence und"er the Public Order Act 1936, wherelhe wording is 
'likely to be occasioned'. 
Nothing turns on the word 'may' save the fate of a particular 
behaviour, save the outcome ofa ease, save the destiny of an appeal on 
a point of law. Nothing hangs, nothing turns, on the tense of a verb 
except the question of what it is that has to be proved in a successful 
prosecution. Nothing turns on 'may' rather than 'might' because the 
case is already decided once the words are selected. Now we know the

Where we .are institutionally can also, however, be understood in 
terms of public space and the circulation of bodies, of persons in this 
case, in the public thoroughfare. It would be extremely inaccurate to 
suppose that by virtue of being outside - outside the library, outside 
the courtroom,. free from the cell - that onc had escaped either the 
institution or the law. It may even be worth observing that the bulk of 
the law· of persons and of property is soldy concerned with the 
demarcation and regulation ofinhabited space as a geography, as the 
route of royal messages, as the 'public course' of all forms of 
circulation, which avenues have also always been the courses of 
manners or behaviours. The law of persons exists largely to protect 
the spheres of personal circulation or mobility, the nomadism of 
individuality, of organs: the body is protected from the various forms 
of illegal invasion or of civil or criminal trespass upon the attributes of 
a body, its members or limbs, or alternatively upon the house, the 
garden or the land that surrounds a body. To take one vivid example, 
the tortoffalse imprisonment is solely concerned with the individual's 
right of 'egress': that is, of entry and exit of any given space. The 
plaintiff could be drunk, asleep, catatonic, meditating, stupefied or 
voluntarily chained to·a table, and yet-ifthe defendant deprives the 
plaintiff of the .possibility of leaving {he room or the house or the 
street. that will constitute false imprisonment. I The immediately 
relevant writ, iflt is a criminal matter, would be that of habeas corpus, 
the question being who has the body, where is the body, in which 
house, in whose room? What is preventing the circulation of a body in 
public space, what is limiting its freedom of movement? It is not a 
question of who occupies the body and so of an individual's spiritual 
or metaphysical rights, but rather a matter of what surrounds the 
body and so of its possibilities of movement in public space. To what 
market, to what trade route, to what public course, does this body 
attach itself? If it is arrested in some form, then by what right, for an 
inhabited body is 'quick', it exists as movement, it circulates, it has 
See Bird v. j(JlIls (1845J 7 QB 742, per Coleridge' J: 'If, in the course of a 
night, both ends ofa street ~ere walled up, and there was no egress from the house 
but into the street, I should have no difficulty in saying that the inhabitants were 
thereby imprisoned.' The only restriction impo!ed by the majority decision in the 
case was that the constraint be total, in other words that there be no alternative 
available route. Lord Denman, dissenting, observes interestingly and radically: 
I had no idea that any person in these times supposed any particular 
boundary lO be necessary to constitute imprisonment .. . '

places, a geography? So if we are concerned more generally with 
institutional questions, with where we are, then particular attention 
needs to be paid to specific geographies. Indeed, a parallel needs to be 
drawn between a cartography of the public sphere and the articula-
tions, the signs, that layout the body and refract its gaze off into the 
street. I 
Here it is a question ofa town, a metropolis, London, and certain 
places within it. Magna Carta, as will be recollected, guarantees to 
London its liberties and customs, and in the present case they are 
protected or enforced by local legislation, an l839 Act governing 
offences 'in any Thoroughfare or public Place' within the limits of the 
Metropolitan Police District.2 We will return to that point. The issue 
of place is too important to be abandoned. The headnote begins as 
follows: 'In the early hours of the morning in a public street in London 
the defendants were seen by two passing.couples .. .'. If we move to 
page 4ob, a paragraph headed 'Case stated' and then to the judgment 
of Glidewell LJ, we learn that it was on II June 1984 that the 
particular public street was occupied by the defendants in the manner 
subject to the present legal challenge. It was 1.55 a.m. on the 'south 
footway' or Oxford Street: 'it was in the open street, one of the busiest 
streets in the United Kingdom, although it was 1.55 a.m.', Although 
it is mentioned only twice, the two men, Simon Thomas Masterson 
and Robert Matthew Cooper, were at a bus stop. That this site is 
passed over so quickly is important: in England the bu~ stop is not 
simply what Sartre describes as a serial place, a group space where 
the only connective bond or form of group membership between 
individuals is the purely abstract one of the bus route, the cohering 
power of the third being the teleology of public transport.' It is also

Sartre, Critique of Dialectical ReQ.f(Jn I, TJu(Jt;l of Practical Ensembles (1976, London),

other indexical items to the text indicate both an existent and artistic 
(Le. technical) juridical vocabulary and a tradition of statement and 
interpretation. What most specifically inscribes the words (the 
lexicon) as those of the law is not simply the archaism of the terms, ofa

:,'absolute discharge', but also and more emphatically the form of 
" referencing to a statute, to cases and to determinations in other texts. 
For Lord Reid (Brutus v. Coans). 'the proper construction ofa statute 
is a question of law. If the context shows that a word is used in an 
unusual sense the court will determine in other words what thaI 
.- unusual sense is', while for McCullough]. (Parkin v. Norman), in'more

be proved: 
Having established a realm of reference, of tcue texts and proper

" specific inscription (B2) to delete agency from the justification of a 
:. decision: the language of the law must acquire an objectivity, a 
universality that cannot be limited in its presentation to the 
contingency of a particular behaviour. We move to a decision that 
, tells us about insults and the manner of insulting, to persons in 
general and no particular person: the question for Glidewell LJ is thus 
" framed as follows: 
How does one reconcile the clear statement that an intention to insult 
somebody else is not necessarily a part of the offence with the later 
passage that an insultis something which is directed by one person at 
another? Reading the two together, what the second passage must be 
understood to mean is that words or behaviour cannot be insulting if 
there is not a human target which they strike, whether they are intended 
to strike that target or no(' [4431 
, For there to be a breach, in other ~ords, a specific projectile would 
have to have hit a specific wall. 
Moving to B3, the answer to the question of why the judge 
interprets this behaviour as being such a projectile. as breaching this 
early morning peace, as being an offence, is rec.operable through the 
word 'objectionable'. The passage reads opaquely and indeed 
, taufOlogically and needs to be cited in full:

'footpath' carry photographs of lips, of breasts, of nipples, of 
buttocks? How many advertising hoardings endeavour to.sell their 
products by direct reference to or through images of the erotic? How 
many bus shelters now carry advertisements? 
The issue of reading posed by the above analysis can be reformu~ 
lated in terms of a supplement to onc of the best known of legal 
metaphors. Behaviour at a bus stop is the issue. The questions it 
raises concern manners and reasonableness in public places, 
although the judgment will not present these questions in a direct 
way. We are, in other words, already involved in a supplementary 
reading which can be depicted again in terms of buses. For the 
common law, reasonableness is an attribute that is frequently defined 
in terms of 'the man on the Clapham omnibus'. The Clapham 
omnibus indeed has for long provided the criterion onegal rationality 
where it is a matter of fact: would a reasonable man find this 
behaviour negligent, offensive, reckless, immoral? becomes, in law, 
would the man on theClapham omnibus react in such a manner? The 
reasonable man is on the bus, not at the Clapham omnibus stop. He is 
certainly not at an Oxford Street bus stop, although there are several 
routes between Clapham and Oxford Street. The point is that the 
reasonable man is already travelling; reason icselfis teleological, it is 
on its way, it has a purpose, somewhere to go - whereas those at the 
bus stop have yet to embark upon the rationality ofsocial circulation; 
they are outside the omnibus, dark figures who are in this instance to 
be judged from the busj they are not reasonable, they are common, 
vulgar, to be bound over, to be punished. To institute a reasonable 
public life requires certainly that the lawyer can difTuentiate 
precisely between the reasonable and the merely vulgar, bet\veen the 
innocuous reverie of the passenger and the dangerousness of any 
appearance of eros in the public course: 'overt homosexual conduct in 
a public street, indeed overt heterosexual conduct in a public street, 
may well be considered by many persons to be objectionable' (44c-<l). 
The comparison of homosexual and heterosexual conduct docs not 
hold in the text; we will return to it. For the moment the issue is one of 
security and threat: the demand for ordinariness or predictable and 
routine behaviour in public, the legal demand for good manners, 
returns us to the starting point of this chapter and of the case, that of 
Englishness and of the need of the English to secure not only their 
home but also- through ritual, through honour, through ceremonials 
such as those of the common law, of the law of the land - to secure the

sense of distance) of coldness and courtesy, that make the public 
rr:alm secure in the Queen's peace and allow us to believe that life is 
proceeding as normal. 
I will move now to separate out the elements of the judgment itself 
according to its textual laws, which is to say according to a semiotic 
schema of the forms of transmission that are used. in a case. The 
question to be answered is a classical one. The legal institution 
institutes social life. The logic of the law that institutes such life is 
supposedly a discrete one.; it is circular or syllogistic according to the 
exponents of English jurisprudence. The analysis of a case as pure 
text, pure law, as a sign, will allow us to raise the issue both of the 
circularity of the judgment - its literal discreteness, for no one talks or 
writes like this - and also, and more usefully, the indications of 
supplementarity, the flaws and silences, the marks or traces of other 
discourses, the , breaks and faults in the seams of the circle. Those 
faults are precisely the basis of a supplementary reading: how does 
one read a case against itself? Figure 7. t provides a list of elements to 
be checked in any attempt to depict the significatory logic of a text, 
particularly a legal text. These are elements, it must be stressed, of 
description and no morej they descri~e a singular text and they may 
well need to be revised for the analysis of ot~ers. At the same time,

narrative sequence. If the text is a manner of doing things, it is, 
question of how it is done that the semiotician follows, obsclrvinll; 
amongst other things Nietzschc's injunction that the 
perception is essentially one that vicws form as content, 
content, the materiality of a body, the surface of a skin, its eX'tenlsi(m,: 
its egress into the world. 
In iconic terms, the opening question is that which asks of what 
legal text is actually a sign, what does it represent, what manner 
order, what specific life? The icon separates licit and illicit modes 
representation; it ,establishes a regime of similarity, of repetitions, 
the permitted forms of figuration of an absent God, and so also 
law in abeyance, an immemorial tradition. The iconic function is 
that which inaugurates the social as representation and meaning as 
sign of something else, as reference to a presence beyond - external 
- the sign. The icon introduces the principle of spirituality . 
Western interpretation or hermeneutics; it separates the text from' 
referent, and in law that separation takes the exemplary form 
order of legitimate reference - every text is a sign of further texts, 
memory as a hierarchy of texts and of sociality as the inscription 
that textual order. We can begin the examination of the function 
annunciation (Dr ) by looking to the dual character of that text 
instituting an order of reference and as inscribing a principle 
interpretation. The term annunciation can be taken first in the 
of its root meaning of the Latin annunciatus, that which de,clarcs: 
beforehand, that brings a message, a message which is WLssllcauy, 
from Rome, from the Papacy via the papal messenger or nuncio. 
this initial sense, our concern is with all the mechanisms 
depicted which differentiate legal discourse from those other 
discourses which are not law, which will fade in the very moment 
their statement. The discourse with which we are concerned dues 
simply_ remain, it is emblematic; it establishes the site of the true 
that is thrown within, the sign that will capture a subject, that 
emblematic in the sense of the Greek emba/lo, of throwing inside, 
expending from within. 
In Christian doctrine, of which the law is a part, theannunciiallion, is;j 
also taken to be the process which presences the Holy Spirit: 
archangel Gabriel is sent to tell our Lady that she was chosen to 
mother of God. The annunciation is in that sense the ImlmaC'uIaLte:

virgin mother of Christ. It is logos, the word as incarnation of

outcome: anything, any behaviour, particularly 
behaviour, 'may' - as a present tense, as a prescnt or continuing 
possibility - provoke a breach.of the peace, whereas whether or not it 
did, whether in the past tense it might (have), is a separable question, 
a stronger thing to have to prove; 'May' connotes a possibility and no 
more, an ability to do something, a purpose or concession which may 
or may not be realised. On the other hand, 'might' is redolent of 
probability; it connotes a power to do something, a force that will 
penetrate, something real and not simply imagined. If Simon M. and 
Robert C. are to be disallowed their appeal, if they are to he held 
correctly convicted in law upon facts that were found by those best 
situated, at Marlborough Street Magistrates' Court, then it will be 
best to read section 54( 13) as requiring thal there be proof of a 
possible breach of the peace, proof of nothing more than that a breach 
of the peace 'may be occasioned'. 
If we stop~d at this place, at the inscription of the text in relation 
to the adjudicated facts of the casc, we would still need somf': account 
of the nature of a 'breach of the peace'. In classical common law 
terms, a, breach of the peace is a breach of the king's peace, a 
disruption vi d armis or by force and arms of the law of the land, of the 
custom of the realm. Even an elementary analysis, howeve:, would 
require that we look further at the nature of a breach: it is a breaking 
of the law, a breach of contract, a breach of promise, certainly, b:.t it is 
also perhaps additionally a breach as in the breaching of a wall so as 
to invade a city, so as to end a Siege, a manner of moving in, of 
invasion or intrusion, a breaking through. The breach itsdf is a 
wounded spot, a broken space, a disputed place, a gap or fiss!Jre in 
fortifications made by a battery. According to thac broader l-exical 
definition, the gap exists to be closed, something must be erected to fill 
the breach, to make the wall whole, to make the city secure, to 
reintroduce order, the order of the conquerors - a new law perhaps. 
The second moment of inscription thus occurs in relation to other 
discourses. Position 3A is therefore concerned with intertextualhy, 
which is to say with all the possible forms of behaviour that the 
decision will imply for the order of the citYi more prosaically. with 
how it is to be explained or represented to those subject to the law. 
The question now is that of the nature of an insult, of , insulting Words 
or Behaviour ... whereby a Breach of the Peace may be occasioned'. 
and the fashion by which it may provoke an infringement of the pre· 
existent order of the street. Here the judge mUSt refer to the contexts in 
1M Enchanted Past: A Semiotics oj Common La'w 
243 
insults have been held previously to have made their mark, to 
· have infringed the serenity of the 'Thoroughfare or Public Place'. The 
question here is directly that of what is the law? What do the books, 
· the reports, have to say? The Question is metaphorical insofar as the 
precedents examined concern other, differently worded legislation 
and involve places other than bus stops. The cases referred to as 
, establishing the law had deah with a demonstration at the All 
England Lawn Tennis Tournament at Wimbledon (Brutus v. COl-ens 
[1972 J 2 All ER 1297) and with allegedly homosexual behaviour-
· masturbation, the sin of On an - in a public lavatory (Parkin v. Norman 
· [198'J 2 Al ER 583)' The metaphor that operates in the judgment 
give:1 by Glidewell LJ must transport the discussion of insulting 
behaviourj openly indulged masturbation in a public space which 
was willingly observed by a police officer, to fondling and cuddling in 
a thoroughfare or on a footpath by appellants 'wholly unaware-of 
other persons in the vicinity'. It must abstract from the time and place 
ofa public lavatory and an explicitly intended but essentially solitary 
act to a quite different circumstance and place. It does so by finding a 
'surprising likeness' or resemblance I of behaviours in the definition of 
an unwitting insult as being constituted by behaviour which 'albeit it 
: was not deliberately aimed at a particular person or persons .. . 
· [couldJ be insulting to any member of the public who might be 
passing by' (44b--C) and later as conduct in a public stre~t if such 
conduct 'may well be regarded by another person, particularly by a 
~ young woman, as conduct which insults her by suggesting that she is 
, somebody who would find such conduct in public acceptable herself' 
· (44d-e), The authority of this view, let it be well noted, is the 
argument given in the House of Lords decision in Brutus v. COl.,tns that 
the behaviour there in question could have been insulting if it Iwas 
tantamount to a statement, "I believe you are another homosexual", 
· which the average heterosexual would surely regard as insulting' 
(43a- b), So how does this metaphor hold together other than by a 
, quality of sheer surprise? The answer is that it does so only by virtue of 
the institution, by virtue of being a part of a system of rules that 
identify and delete behaviours according to a tacit structure of 
reasonableness) in this case of travel: the institution, the law, creates a 
manner of doing things, creates a fiction in the form of a list of the

up the body to the public eye but forgets itself. If we look at a body .

and also a practitioner of sodomy, of 'unnatural sexual intercourse, 
especially that of one male with another'. When used of places, it can 
also be noted, the sodomitical refers to things polluted or infected by 
sodomy. Were ..... e to doubt that meaning, the second sentence repeats 
the accusation of sexual abnormality. It is specific: you afe doing this · 
in front of our girls. Might it not be all right if it had been done in front . 
of our boys, the boys who play rugger and who, like Lord Justice 
Glidewell, went to all~male private boarding schools, who shared 
baths and slept in dormitories and suffered initiation rites at an early 
age? Small wonder that Glidwdl docli not wish to dwell upon the 
revulsion of the sodomiticali it might well summ~n not the im-
memorial law as to the peace but highly specific memories of a very 
English institution and a very profane body wherein ~time out of

particular 'hothouse regime in which our judges and politicians 
usually trained and in which buttocks, bottoms and fundaments 
feature constantly: they are birched or caned, they are smacked, they 
are seated, they are squeezed, very occasionally they are caressed, 
and there is nothing more frightening (or exciting) to the rustic 
Englishman than the intimacy of that particular caress. The buttocks

are iconic; the icon separates the text from its referent: it is the 
genitals that are being rubbed, but it is the buttocks. that are 
offending. In law that separation is a means of disassociating organs 
through a gaze that will screen thejudge from the lived act; it is also 
the interpretative deceit that makes possible an order of legitimate 
reference, a reading from memory. The question of interpretation is 
that ofwlzose memory, whose order of reference docs the law institute? 
So Glidewell evades the issue and simply signals in the properly 
elliptIcal way what the law has always known: there are those who are 
like us and those who are not, there is the establishment and there are 
those who are uncouth, there are chaps who are discreet in their 
homosexual preferences - and the establishm:nt is not lacking in 
examples - and there are those who flaunt an unacceptable difference, 
who ~o over to the other side - quite often they are also communists, 
traitors, betrayers of the Crown. Indeed, LordJ ustice Glidewell, who 
seems to attract homophobic litigation, later took the opportunity il} 
the case of Regina v. Director oj the Government Communications Htad~ 
quart""x part, lIodges (t g88, Guardian Law Report, 20July) to rule 
that simply being a homosexual could legitimately be treated as being 
a threat to national security. Hodges had openly declared himself to 
be homosexuaL At a routine security review his positive vetting 
clearance was withdrawn on the grounds that 'he might be vulnerable 
, to pressure or blackmail from a hostile intelligence service due to his 
current homosexual lifestyle' . GlidewelllJ was expansive and wholly 
. unmoved by any apparent cor.tradiction between the openness of 
Hodges' erotic self--dec1aration and the requirement of secrecy for 
. blackmail successfully to threaten disclosure: it was enough that 
Hodges was homosexual and 'it could not be said (hat the decision to 
withdraw security clearance was absurd, perverse or irrational'. If, as 
seems plausible in the light of the decision in Masterson v. Holden, it-was 
Glidewell's view that homosexuality should always be hidden, that 
:. e."otic p<,,',ersityshould never be. openly declared, let alone displayed, 
then Hodges' sin was a lack of discretion: he would have done much 
better before Glidewell ifhe had remained in the 'closet' -or, indeed, 
the public toilet -
where homosexuality has its traditionally 
scatological place. 
In tormal terms, the logic of the judgment in Masterson is circular; it 
is dead in the sense that it institutes a life tha[ masks the life that ~s 
'. lived, that denies the lives that are actually led. The institution quite

objectionable, to be conduct which ought to be confined to a private 
place, [That} the fact is objectionable does not constitute an offence. But 
the display of such objectionable conduct in a public street may well be 
regarded by another person, particularly by a young woman, as cond uct 
which insults her by suggesting that she is somebody who would find 
such conduct in public acceptable herself. [44c-d] 
We will pass over the obvious circularity of the statement, the 
proposition that what is objectionable is objectionable to a person 
because it is unacceptable, and enquire instead into the objectionable 
in an intertextual sense. 
All maps are based upon a projection; any cartography, in other 
words, is founded upon a particular gaze, literally a throwing of vision 
towards a space, projictre as opposed here to ohjicere or objection, 
which throws in the way of, or constitutes an obstacle, a hindrance. 
The body that constitutes the offence is not something already there, 
something natural; it is a product or projection ofthe legal gaze, and 
its map ofthe body, its human geography, is a geography constructed 
upon the basis of 'the movements that men make and the relations 
that those movements imply'. I What is objectionable, then, is not a 
body, nor is it the parts of the body, the lips, the buttocks, the genitals 
- the genitals cannot even be seen. What we are invited to see is the 
movement of a hand: 'Cooper then placed his hand on Masterson's 
genital area and rubbed his hand around this area' (40h-j). The 
circumscribing hand defines, identifies and creates the erogenous 
object, the offending zone, the objectionable publicised place, an 
imagined swelling, a putative tumescenCe: it is the judicial stare th.lt 
locates, that maps, an imaginary or projected erotic site,lips used and 
hands wandering after illicit or licentious ends. The objectionable 
transpires to be as much the erotic effect of the legal gaze, of a 
particular description of a caress, of what the rubbing motion is made 
to imply, as of any object or behaviour. The gaze informs, it delineates 
a movement in a particular way, it maps a hidden swdling, an 
objectivisation of a specific lOuch, We are left to consider what

her hand to her mouth. It is the judicial eye that places these 
actions, that makes an obstacle of a movement, that objectifies the 
dual parabola of hands searching separate surfaces. It is the hand that 
seeks a mouth, a motion which the legal gaze fixes as a gesture of 
outrage rather than as one of excitation, that will in the end determine 
the character of objectionable conduct. If we go further, the two 
women leave the scene along with the two men they were walking 
with; they leave the law to take its course: 'althougl:t asked to wait by 
the police, [they 1 in fact did not, perhaps not wholly surprisingly, and 
when the police turned their attention to them they had gone' (4Ia), 
It is left to the law to announce a verdict; it is the judge who 
determines what the movement of-two bodies together means; it is the 
law that will objectify the conduct, that will literally object in the 
sense of throwing something in the way ofa specific act. 
The form that legal objectification takes is tabulated in column C in 
terms of the semantic operations that constitute a legal judgment in 
its classical justificatory form, The form is that of generalisation, the 
deletion of specific subjectivities in favour ofa universal law that will 
here govern a particular set of facts by redefining them as legally 
relevant facts, as evidence, as the object to which a rule is applied, 
The rhetoric of written reason is a familiar one; it here establishes a 
ratio decidendi wh-ereby what happens in the case is finally presented as 
a holding, as the definition of a statutory clause and the framing of a 
general rule concerning the nature of insulting behaviour in London 
as it is relevant to the generalised conduct of [he appellants. There is 
little need to dwell on the categories of that reasoning process, the 
question posed here is that of how to read them against themselves, 
how to indicate the mythic quality of that rational frame by relating 
the semantic operations to the iconic functions tabulated in the final 
column. We will define the iconic ~:;upplement both as the licit 
reprcsenta~jon of an image of law, of authority, reason and source, 
and also as the emblematic quality of all legal judgments: the text 
necessarily exceeds both the occasion of its annunciation and the 
literal or repeated content of its judgment. The text is a manner of 
doing something; it is classically an instrument and should in that 
sense be understood as something inhabited and subject to the law of 
numbers; it is demographically sensitive, it is populus and as an 
bstrument it exists to organise, to arrange that population. Under· 
stood as an instrument, the text produces effects: it intervenes in the 
lives of its subjects and it remakes the actions of the actors in its

judgment (D2). In terms oflegal method, the judgment here simply C 
states that authority justifies the designation of this objectionable 
behaviour as insulting within the meaning of the statute, In iconic 
terms, the court has heard the case and resumes to state the law as 
conclusive; an itinerant law stops to mark a place, fixes agaze on a bus 
stop and establishes a commensurability of a public course and 
private parts. In intertextual terms (D3) what is manifest in the 
ruling, the 'holding' - a Teutonic word meaning to watch over - is a 
spirit, the spirit of the law, taking flesh in a sovereign act. The 
judgment recreates a frame of reference, a frame of reason as 
univlrsilas, as the only reason, the only law. The frame determines 
both perception and interpretation; it is the frame that will hold a 
vision, a gaze, in place, The gazt that discerns and diagnoses the . 
dimensions of an essentially elastic space locks in the possibilities of 
pub(l)ic life like a speculumj it creates the very object it claims only to 
observe in the mirror of the law.1 The objectionable act and the 
objectionable object are born simultaneously under this mirror, this 
speculum of the law: it is the judicial imaging of what is happ<:ning to 
the flesh under the surface of clothing that institutes the mask of . 
subjectivity, the person possessed by the law. The gaze fixes a 
particular geography of the body, it organises erogenous space, it · 
articulates imaginary being, it converts a swelling into an object, a · 
surface into a persona: it turns the hand inside out. The circling of a . 
hand around a groin is seen not as an act of eroticism, a passion, but ' 
rather as a vulgarity of behaviour, an insult and an offem:e. The · 
decision decides - it cuts off, decidtre- and the frame thus institutes an . 
order of movement; it imposes an itinerary on the movem(:nt of 
subjectivity in order to intercept a hand; it defines its object and its 
objection by means of denial. The denial is a denial of the frame itself: 
thejudge, LordJustice Glidewell, arrives at his decision by outlawing 
the very eroticism of vision that enabled him to reconstruct thl! 
to see behind the cloth, to reconnoitre the erotic body and to rnap 
movement ofa hand as transgression, If the text is read against 
in iconic terms, it is apparent that what the law announces in 
judgment is its own death, the death orits own reason, the imltit.ut;loni 
of its own life.

Finally, th~re is the question of the difference that a semiotic reading 
makes. ThIS text has pursued two geographies, the geography of eros 
and the geography of public space. It is nOt obvious ·to us that the 
intensional/intensive regions of the body and the extensional space of 
the bus stop are isomorphic: it is not obvious to us that they share the 
same space or that they can be mapped according to the same 
: projective principle, that that organ framed by the legal speculum is 
, the same space, the same place, the same material life which sweJls in 
an order of intimacy, an order of touch, 
. 
If :ve :eturn to Figure 7. f and to the movement of row 4, the 
questIOn IS that of what does the institution oftaw institute? How does 
the law map out the body as a public space, how does it involve itself 
supremely inane's private parts? In a critical sense, a semiotics of law 
can provide an analysis of the various means by which a specific 
: syst~m oflaw, the common law of England, institules a specific life, a 
. speCific body, a specific concept of security, a specific relation

of that presence would determine both the character of the faith 
the forms of adhesion Of of love through which alone the 
,mdlv'"hJal could believe and so obey. In secular terms, the 'other 
, that of the written law of Justinian, reports an early 
recognition in Roman law of an identical issue. Justinian's Institutts 
. (2. 1.34) had decided the case of an artist who paints upon a canvas 
owned by another in favour of the creator of the image and against the 
-owner of the canvas. The twelfth-century glossamrs subsequently 
reversed that decision and assimilated the picture to the canvas by 
means of an analogy between painting and writing. From the twelfth 
century onwards, text and painting were to be treated as analogues: 
pro leclione piClura tsl, the picture is to be read.2 The transposition was 
to prove crucial to the history of Western law. The work of art -
whether it was a painting. a poem, a heraldic device or a bookoflaw-
was to be viewed or read as an act of creation or of authorship.3 
Behind its paint or its letters was another presence, the presence of 
one absent, that of God or Law, of nature or reason from whence the 
image came, from whom - or in whose name - it was sent. Precisely 
because the image was more than its simple appearance, because· it 
., is because they give pleasure to other gods.' An interesting historical text is E.

LANGUAOt, IMAOE,SIGN AND COMMON LAW 
In interpretative terms, the text sees nothing, it hears nothing, it says 
nothing, It runs scared, scared of its own desire, scared of the 
possibility of speech, scared oflife and possibly :..carred by the memory 
of sin, of Sodom, of corruption, of those things which happened long 
ago or ctime out of mind', An institution which has lost the desire to 
speak, that has abandoned the surface of the text, that tyrannises with 
the ,emptiness of reason, is a dead institution, an ,entombed law, no 
more than detritus, relic, remains. My suggestion is thata semioti.::s of 
law can show us some of the forms of dying; it can read the signs and 
interpret the law so as to laugh at it, so as to seduce, to play by 
invocation of other \\oorlds and more rigorous and living languages: 
surely a doctor staring up a speculum sometimes wonders how that 
uterus feels? 
It is a question finally of value, of the value oflife, and correlatively 
of the value of an interpretation, of what it can do. If we pose that 
question seriously, then we need to take up the position of 
accOuntants and be explicit about the material expenditure of specific 
lives and more particular about the values -
the passions, the 
movements, the risks - through which being is accumulated and 
through which being is spent. I The very word 'interpretation' bears 
an important actuarial connotation since the Latin in/apreJ from 
which interpretation is derived has at its root the word pretium or 
price.2 Interpretation haggles before it fixes prices, it negotiates with 
the law, it seeks to make a bargain, it endlessly poses the ques'.ion of 
how much does this cost, what should we pay, by what underlying 
measure should the price be fixed, what does the measuring impiy? 
We are left then to balance the books, to audit the existing stock of 
meanings, to adjudicate profit and loss, to decide which interpreta· 
tion to buy and for what quantity of promissory notes, for how many 
coins, for what futures? . 
The question is, what docs an interpretation do? In that sense it is 
necessary to make comparisons, to calculate, not according to an 
order of truth - the law has always represented the truth - but

: according to an economy of texts and interpretations. Why look at it 
that way, why use that frame, why take a speculum to a body in love, 
why vulgarise an object or make a relationship, a motion, into a 
disir.vested thing? Those are the values, the questions of life or of 
living, that are at stake in each judgment, that ideally give interpreta-
tion its value or, alternatively and more critically, that constitute its 
costs, its penalties, the losses attendant upon a method of interpret a-
tion that has lost its way, that has abdicated the role of merchant or 
.. haggler over meaning and the material and rhetorical forms which 
meaning lakes. 
Returning in conclusion to the character of a semiotic reading of 
common law, to the difference that it makes, to the question of what it 
does, it is helpful to recollect the particular character of any semiotics. 
If it is meaningful to talk of a general semiotics, it would refer simply 
to the signifying structure of all social life. J At the level of structure, 
the economic motif can be extended and it can be observed that 
: societies form around systems of exchange, for it is only as material 
signs, as currency, that the dements ofa culture can circulate, that a 
path can be formed in the moveable space of the imagination. All 
elements of culture circulate by means of such a symbolism, by means 
': of an economic representation of value, hy representing in material 
form a token of exchange, something, a woman, a text, a body, a word, 
for which we are prepared to accept a substitute. In each case the 
generality ofa system of signs, of an economy of values, is specific in 
the sense that it is only on the basis of an order of legible and so 
negotiable, interpretable signs that exchange is possible: there has to 
be something to negotiate, there has to be a partially closed system of 
equivalences, of substitutions, offorms of paraphrase, for an economy 
to function, for goods to move, Precisely because it exists to be 
exchanged, because it exists as a value, the sign is irr~ducible : to be a 
. sign is nothing other than to be mobile, to exist as the possibility of 
movement, as a means of accumulation and circulation. 
Take up the last notion, that it is the materiality of signs that allows 
'As in the case of women, the original impulse which compelled men to 
'.'exchange" words must be sought for in that split representation that pertains to 
the symbolic function. When a sonorous object is simult.aneou!ly perceived as 
having a value both for the speaker and the listener, the only way to resolve chis 
c.ontradic.tion is in the exchange of complementary values. to which all socia.l 
: existence is reduced.' (C. uvi-Strauss. Structural AntlzroPrJlrJgy, 1963. London, p .

Three indices from Nietzsche may serve to map the direction that 
be traced in Legendre's studies in terms of genealogy, forms 
and tragedy. 2 
Firstly, reference should be made [Q [he development ofNi,otz,c1le'; 
genealogical project. I ts basic proposition was that to understand 
past was not to under!tand something that happened, a truth, 
rather [0 comprehend forms oflife or modes ofliving - all th,,,e form,: 
of inheritance, of emotion, habit, experience and seduction, 
reproduce the human as a specific life. The value of history 
precisely that of its modes of appearance: it was through hs myths, its 
symbols and its rites that the past lived. In the early and little: 
recognised essaysl on' philology, Nit:tzsche inveighed again~t the ' 
historical disciplines for studying a dead past, a past annihilated by 
the 'Gorgon head of the classicist' ,+ the priestly imitator and 'Ullme': 
servant of an idealised Latinity. oS What is dead is simply dead and in 
that sense there is no history, no consecrated order of death. What 
lives in the past is that which ignored death, which through art' · 
transfigured life and became image and myth in articulo mortis: not · 
history but tradition, The positive project ofa genealogy is develoPed 
later as a study of the elements of life: 
Hitherto all that has given a colour to existence has lacked a history; 
where would one find a history of love, of avarice, of envy, of conscience, 
ofp,iety, of cruelty? Even a comparative history oflaw ... All that up till 
now has been considered as the 'conditions of existence', of human 
beings, and all reason, passion and superstition in this consideration _ 
have they been investigated to the end?'6

Vene;,lo!!y, in short, would study the desc.erit of the conditions of 
existe'nce to expose 'a body totally imprinted bv history',' 
Secondly, as the invocation of genealogy suggests, reason is no 
: longer to be viewed as the only order of the disciplines. It belongs 
; rather to the many his[Ories of sentiment and passion, albeit that ids 
~O\"llas"i(m,our inescapable tradition, our institution. To uncover the 
body of that institution in genealogical terms is to study its ancestry, 
its descent. It is to study also what is lost in this transmission; to 
· understand that a history of inscription includes the history of the 
· surface, of that which was scratched out in order to make a certain 
mark, that which was covered in order to paint a certain sign, that 
· which was mixed in order to make a certain image stick, that which 
was burned in order to make a certain brand. Behind the order of 
disciplines, screened by systems of knowledge, Nietzsche had from 
early on discerned, behind the figure of the scholar, the shadow of the 
lawyer. The classical tradition was a legal traditicn, irs writings were 
notarial, its knowledgt:s were clerical catalogues, filing systems of 
distinctions, for thest: 'are philosopht:rs who are at bottom nothing 
but systematising brains - the formal part of the paternal occupation 
has' br:come its essence to them. The talent for classifications, for 
tables of categories, betrays something; it is not for nothing that a 
person is the child of his parents. The son afar. advocate will also have 
to be an advocate as invt:stigator',2 In more formal terms, the 
discourse of truth has always appeared in the guise oflaw. 
There is finally the question of that which lives and lives on, or in 
Nietzsche's phrase: che who has no sense for the symbolical has none 
for antiquity'.' The last stage of the genealogical project and the 
purpose ofits history Cis not to discover the roots of our identity but to 
commit itself to its Jissipation'," and thereby to recover or to make 
again the tragic reality of appearance: as action, as image and myth. 
life depends upon art and its theatre of illusion. In terms spelled out 
most explicitly in Tht Birth of Tragedy, the Socratic tradition or 
rationalism in its various historical forms was to be credited with 
having killed art and most particularly with the destruction of myth. 
Nietzsche offers both a diagnosis and a prognosis. In terms of the

LANGUAGE, INAGE, SIGN AND COMMON LAW 
Because it is with the movement of two bodies that the case is , 
concerned. any legal rule that emerges, any norm or abstract 
standard of behaviour that is to be gleaned from the decision, cannot 
escape the brute particularity, the libidinal surface, upon which an 
idea, (of tenderness, of transgression, of violence, of insulting, of the 
proper) is inscribed, across which or through which an idea makes 
itsdf felt, makes itsdf life. The case deals with the movement of a 
hand, but it is not obvious that the violation is not that of the eye. It is 
not obvious that the decision makes felt a concurrent opposition 
between a geography which maps out and reconnoitres the body and 
the city on the basis of the eye and its specular judgments, and a 
geography mapped out by the hand, that hinges on a space traversed 
by the flesh, accessible only through touch -
3 terrain of which the 
hand has proprietary knowledge, a soil only the hand can legitimately 
enter, a dimension that can be traced only by sensation, a map that 
only the skin can remember, 
. 
Were we to pursue, to deepen, our analysis of the case it would be 
necessary to proceed to a semiotics of gesture and the equivocal 
history of the hand. The hand is the ind<x of the flesh of the world: it 
has.freed the flesh of slaves in the Roman law of manumission, it has 
cured sick flesh through faith, it has made the earth flesh through the 
common law ritual of seisin, it has mea!oi.ured the bodies of animals with 
reference to its own private parts - a horse, for example, is fourteen 
hands or more. The hand will always be a throwback to an older 
signature, an older form of possession, an older understanding of 
proximity, an older measure of distance. of space, of movement, of 
labour, of value. The hand still carries the world with its own palmy 
scale. The hand can measure the age of a th:ng through its fold, its 
moistness, its tendernesses. The hand shares m the intimate life of 
things. 
The difference between law as a result of bargaining or a mediated, 
non.universal reality and law as an absolute, written text that maps 
out the body and the city once and for ever and for always is 
ultimately the diffr:rence between two forms of reason, two 
approaches to a text, two histories. Thejudgment analysed exists only 
within the space of a linear reason; its approach is progressive, it 
abolishes the possibility of interpretation by its refusal to recognise 
the irreducibility of writing, the history of the institution of writing as 
a political history of the struggle over differing formsoflife. Explicitly, ; 
the issue is one of an opposition between reason and rhetoric, the· 
Tht Enchanttd Past: A Semiotics of Common lAw '59 
and the sensuous, the inside and the outside. The opposition 
can also be posed in terms of the difference between a semiotics oflaw 
and the diagrammatic logic of contemporary forms of legal reason, 
· Semiotics is concerned with the irreducibility of forms; its mode of 
interpretation is one which is based upon bargaining precisely 
because neither writing nor gesture nor geography can be reduced to 
literal contents, What we see in a sign is the possiblity of move me, nt, 
the mobility of value, the circulation of goods, In that sense 
movement is fluid; it continuously remakes [he institution and it 
bargains as to where and when the human can appear. That 
bargaining concerns the inside, the hamartia of material life as it is 
faced in the sensuous apprehension of thought: semiotics does not 
survey the surface of things so as to read an inner will or a unitary 
intention behind the thing; it reads the surface as a surface, as a 
sensuous and material field offorce which extends outwards, which 
imposes its form upon the world, The concept of the inside, of 
hamartia or the tragedy, the historical plenitude of Jived history in its 
numerous memorised forms, is all that there is to interpretation, It 
, asks, where are we, according to what law, at"what cost, in what 
history, and in whose speech? 
In the specific terms of our analysis, can the law move in between 
the hand and the eye? Can it understand its maps as provisional? Can 
it see the bus stop as a collapsible space: a city space for the women, an 
· order of intimacy for the two men? Would it be possible then to map 
out an interpretative strategy, or a set of strategies, whereby the law 
could move in between a geography mapped out by the eye, a 
'. panoptical space held up by the projections of those who inhabit it, 
and a geography navigated by the hand, accessible only through 
touch, a dimension that can be traced only by sensation, a map that 
only the skin can remember? 
The law would then recognise itself as always and already a deep 
structure of the erotic body: it would not follow the movement of life 
· from behind, or hover over it from above, but would see itself surface 
, through the body itself, the gestures themselves, the actions, the 
· manipulations, the betrayals, the desires and the demotic of everyday 
life, Ifsuch a semiotics of law, such an interpretative strategy, were 
possible, it would be able to read the inner body, the body that lives' 
'. and feels the world through the law, the emotional underside of a flesh 
· that has many seams, many cOrTidors, many waiting rooms, many 
archways, many altars.

(Paroles Poitiquts ichappier du kxte) , The last-mentioned work, 
lished in I982, significantly developed themes that became central in-' 
later studies, In L 'Empire de la Virili, Legendre embarked upon the 
t~ird stage of his project, now published in the magisterial style of 
UfOnJ, that of an historical anthropology of contemporary know-
ledges, an analysis of the dogmatics of ultra modernity. His last twO 
published works further specify and substantiate a project that has 
spanned over thirty years and continues into the future with the 
founding of a national centre for the study of genealogy and filiation in 
Paris; In L 'Inestimable Objet de La Transmission, we are presented with an 
intricate study of the genealogical basis of normative systems of 
thought, which was followed by a translation of key and 'undesirable' 
texts on Western systems of kinship I u Dossier Occidental de La Partnti; 
In his most recent work, Lt Dlsir Politique dt Dieu, published last year, 
Legendre presents his most comprehensive study to date of the 
iconography of power, a study of the aesthetics oflaw, ofthejul'idical 
system of signs, of signs which get under the skin and mark the 
emotional body of the subject, the organs, the obedient. souL 
Critique of Dogmatic Reason I 
For the benefit of common lawyers still unfamiliar with, or unwilling 
explicitly to acknowledge, the European history of their law, certain 
preliminary observations as to dogmatic reason arc probably neces-
sary~ Dogmatics, derivcd from the Greek dMein, to think, has an 
instructively ambivalent semantic history, In one little-acknow-
ledged derivation, to which Legendre frequently returns, it refers to' 
the unconscious unravelling of thought, to reverie"and the recounting 
of dreams and visions. In this aspect, dogma relates to the images ofa 
simulated world of appearance and becomes the root of the latin 
terms decu.s, decor and decet, referring to dignity, decorum and honour, 
aestheti.: terms of considerable political importance insofar as it was 
Legendre does not himself use the term critique and I am conscious- that it 
bears certain negative Hegelian conno,ations.l use it here in a weak sense to draw 
attention to the affinity between the criti.cal dimension of Legendre's work and the 
various contemporary critiques of enlightenment reason. Most particularly,]. P.

decorum, for the honour and the dignity of-their country (patria) 
that Romans would die most readily: dulce etdecorum est pro patriamori" ~ 
That aesthetic dimel ~sion of dogma, of the images for which the 
subject would die, is crucial to the comprehension of the discourse 
that is repressed in the later usage of dogmatics as the study oC 
religious and legal truths, its object being that which has already been 
decided. In that acceptation it is an axiomatic form -of study 
developed by the scholastics of the twelfth-century university2 as the 
methodical presentation of the order oflaw, 
To live and to die for a totem, a country, a fatherland, for the Law, 
was in one quite literal sense to adhere to an image of power with one's 
body: to a portrait of the king,3 to a mystic body, a flag or emblem 
which would screen the subject against death while leading inexor-
ably to it (moriendum cnk 1st). In the later dogmatic tradition, the 
symbolics of power, of the power of life and death and of the order of 
law that mediated between the two categories, was displaced by the 
glossatorial concept of a sacral written law, a law which expressed the 
one truth and the unitary cause (causa causans) of a monotheistically 
conceived God. That God was the universal emperor of the Roman 
Catholic world, the author of all law (Deo auctort) and the source of all 
truth. For the dogmatic interpretative tradition that developed from 
the late eleventh century onwards and founded the university 
disciplines, that foundational tenet was to be understood quite 
literally and so to the exclusion of all other truths: that is, to the 
exclusion of all other gods. Rigorously excluding any aesthetic or 
poctic conceptions of emperor or law that might indicate the temporal 
and mythic fabrication of the divine will, dogmatics translated myth 
into truth and Law into Text: vtram philosophiam, "on simulationtm; the 
monotheistic belief in one God is the unitary root of the scientific 
belief in a single trmh, in one law.

belonged to the emotive body of a natural or unwritten tradition of 
law, to a secret knowledge of the heart, it could threaten or hold the 
invisible body, the emotional body, the affective subject or soul of 
those subject to the law. 
The vast symbolic residue of the text is, according to Pierre 
Legendre, the indispensable condition of a knowledge of Western 
legal structure. It is a lost knowledge of the icons, images and Names, 
of the rites and myths, through which Western law becomes effective 
upon its subjects. It is to an aesthetic knowledge of the signs of law 
that the extensive writings of Legendre I have been dedicated. They 
have endeavoured to recover a lost poetic or mythic dimension oflegal 
institutions and it is therefore as an aesthetic theory of the legal form 
that his work will be presented. This is admittedly to follow only one 
of several possible trajectories through his work. Other possible 
approaches would include the presentation of his writings as a history 
of the Roman and Canon law traditions,2 a history of their presence in 
contemporary law, and as an application of psychoanalysis to legal 
theory, In the latter respect, Legendre, who has trained and practised 
as a psychoanalyst, has certainly contributed extensively to a 
Lacanian theory of the possession of the legal subject by Law, a theory , 
of subjective adhesion or love of law as faith in the Oth(c, in' 
Knowledge and in Text.:! Such approaches, however, provide 
accounts of no morc than elements of a much larger philosophical 
project, that of a genealogy of legal institutions.1

" Legendre's project is that of the immoralist b~fore the law,l The 
account that he renders, the debt he pays, is that of coming to term5 
with Nietzsche as philosopher and genealogist of law. Situating his 
own work as that of one who writes in the twilight of the enlighten~ 
menl, Legendre pushes forward the project of a subjectivist 
philosophy of the forms of attachment to law.2 The question is 
initially that of the theatre of attachment, an issue of the mask or role 
or identity thai will bind Ihe individual to law, thai will tie together in 
legal form the unity of a lived existence and so secure the political

:.errdl.ess:l) repeated question of foundation or quaestio quid iuris. At one 
level the answer to the question was that law was a word, a name, an 
etyrr:olbgy, that is worked both by the Roman lawyers and by their 
later interpteters. At the level of the symbolic wit~ which Lcgendr~ IS 
concerned, ' the question leads uS into the realm of the pecuhar 
mythology bflaw, that ofa sacred mouth that speaks thelaw and in 
turn of a speech that embodies or incarnates the holy WIll. What IS 
crucial is that the imagery in which the law is clothed is not ignored in 
favourof some notion of its rationa} content. The question posed, the 
image that descends upon the intellect, is a genealogical on~ and 
depends for its answer upon a lineage of descent, a presentatIon of 
filiation which will assign the law to a legitimate author or parent. 
The dogmatic answer to the question of origin incarnates the law in 
the mouth of the sovereign emperor: law comes from the oracle, from 
the living voice'oflaw (viva oox iuris) in the person, {he mask, of God's 
servant, vicarius Christi, Justinian. The point is quite literally funda-
mental to the presence of law as a living and breathing law (lex 
animata), as the work of the tongue that speaks the law as ifit were his 
own. The line of parentage or descent can be traced through the 
glossatorial metaphors of filiation and equally through the icon,: 
graphy of legal power in which the heart of the legal subJe~t IS 
invariably represented as hanging on a thread held by the sovereIgn, 
be it emperor, Leviathan or Justinian in person. In more prosalc 
terms, the imperial image of God (imago Dei et Mundi) answers the 
question of origin in terms of ancestry: the law must be presented as. a 
distant speaking body, a corpus iuris from whose mouth all law will 
emanate and in whose breast all the archives are concealed: omnia 
serinia habet in pectore suo. From that emblematic vanishing point the 
law acquires both its name and its authority: hung as a screen before 
the unspeakable and invisible realm of the Other, the portrait of the 
emperor is there to mediate, innocently to mouth true law as per ora 
principium promulgatae. 
Bound to God through the inaugural power of the word, the speech 
of the emperor took the material form oflaw as text. The archaic and 
fragmentary texts to which the emperor appended his name in t~e 
massive form of the Corpus Juris were to become, for the dogmatic 
tradi'tion, the only source of truth and law. In the words of a 
third=enth-century jurist: ~ust as God divided the elements of

former, rationalism, or in contemporary terminology modernism, 
was a species of dogmatic reason determined upon deciding life in 
advance of living it and equally upon valuing the search for truth 
above the truth itself: that is to say. it was a theoretlc reason. one 
which maps out life in advance of itself and thus refuses nfe as art, as 
music, as the conflagration and redrawing of the map. I Surrounded 
by the debris of archaic culture and blind from the dust of books and 
printer's errors, modernity testified apologetically to the loss of myth 
and the repression of the creative powers of poetry and art. Only the 
fading myths, the ruins, of countless other cultures stood between 
modernity and the most radical pessimism. In terms of prognosis, 
Nietzsche viewed art as the limit of scientific objectivism, and myth as 
the necessa'ry consequence or end of science: 'only after the spirit of 
science has been led to its boundaries, and its claim to universal 
validity has been destroyed by the evidence of these boundarie:!, can 
we hope for are-birth of tragedy: for which form of culture we s~ould 
have to use the symbol of Socrates the musician' .2 
Legendre is more guarded than Nietzsche in his prognosis of the 
future of dogmatic culture.3 It should also be observed that in his 
critique of dogmatics he.uses a Freudian vocabulary of repression and 
desire culminating in a positive prospect of poetic rights and the 
renewal ofinterpretative culture in its fullest sense.'· In terms of his

cisely from the critique of history in terms of a renewed and refined

Will be followed here. In bibliographical terms, such a path can also 
be perceived in the development of Legendre's career. Trained as a 
historian of Roman and Canon law, his earliest work concentrated on 
the eleventh- and twelfth-century revolution in methods of legal and 
scriptural interpretation. The glossa tors of classical law (utrumque ius) 
founded the Western tradition of interpretation and established. by 
reference to the two Romes of the Church and the secular law the 
conditions of existence of the Western legal institution and its v~ried 
~litica~, socia.l.and .other administrative discourses and knowledges.

Moyen Age Occidental and in La Penetration du Droit Romain dans ie Droit

The thesis developed from the early philological studies of the 
learned law was subsequently applied to a genealogy oflaw as a form 
of life. The symbolic strUCture of the glossatorial revolution was 
~raced into the development of the disciplines and was analysed also 
10 terms of the juridical structure of Western institutions; it was 
proposed as their founding logic.2 The studies of this period which 
were published between J968 and I 982-are remarkable for their range 
and .scope of reference and for their overturning of traditional 
claSSIficatory schemata. Inspired by his study and practice of 
psychoanalysis, Legendre presented stUdies that ranged from a 
textbook on the juridical history of the French administration and its 
dogmatics (Hislo~re de ,JAdministration),3 through studies of censorship 
and the dogmatIc order (L'Amour du Censeur) , the nationalism of 
bureaucratic order Uouir du Pouvoir), to a psychoanalytic study of

would be asto"nished neither by its durability, nor by its logic which

Jaw ofsacrilicc, as a Jaw that carries Wlih it afl element 
remorse at alJ that is giveIJ up or repressed in adhering toone law, 
one order orthe licit and the exclusIon of a/I else. I Keeping such 
notion of the s3cred in reserve, Legendre is initially concerned 
the foundational symbolism ofunity and universality in the 
tradition. The sacred law is ambivalent in a less metaphysical 
insofar as it combines two histories and two systems o(wrirten 
those of the Corpus furis Civilis and of the Corpus fun! Canonici. The two 
laws intermingle and the Dtcreta/~ owe quite as much to Justinian's 
Corpus as did the Corpus fum Civilis itself to the Christian theology of 
the incarnate word. For the glossa tors, the law as truth was a matter 
of writing; it was a matter of that which was to be read, the word 'Jaw' 
itselfbdng derived from legere, to read. t What the glossators of Roman 
law provided was a dogmatic method of reading the law as though it 
were the truth.- The principle of such reading can be understood 
initially iri grammatological terms, a single compilation of texts or 
Text was isolated and stored apart, plorecred from time and the 
blandishments of profane reading, it would come to serve as the

The Text is in the first instance a positive expression ofuniversa1 
rule and it is to ':he symbolism ofthae rule rather than to its immediate 
content that attention should be directed. What is established in the 
massive simulation that inaugurates the name or voice of the law is a 
principle of sources. Following the juristic wisdom itself, the first 
question to be posed of the Jaw is that of its origin, frem where it

The dogmatic answer to the question of origin incarnates the Jaw in 
the mouth of the sovereign emperor: law comes from the oracle, from I 
the living voice oflaw (vitia tlOX iuris) in the person, the mask, or God's 
servant, vicarius Christi, Justinian. The point is quite literally funda-
:

graphy of legal power in which the heart of the legal subject is 
invariably represented as hanging on a thread held by the sovereign, 
be it emperor, Leviathan or Justinian in person. In more prosaic 
ttrms, the imperial image of God (imago Dei ,I Mundi) answers the 
question of origin in terms of ancestry: the law must be presented as a

Bound to God through the inaugural power of the word, the speech

tradition, the only source of truth and law. In the words of a

precl~des any very direct access to knowledge, to knowing, to

to everything and nothing, in part because legal knowledge acts as a 
~creen to any alternative enquiry. The censorship of the law operates 
In one respect as a terminological maze: not only docs the law have 
jurisdiction - the right to speech (iuris dietio) - but in a more subtle and 
insid~ous sense Legendre points to the entire panoply of legal 
sophistry as a mechanism geared to silence or censor its opponents in 
the thesaurus, the dictionary of the law. In a passage worth citing at 
length, . Legendre speUs out the awesome responsibility of legal 
categorIes: 
In this game of pure logic, rebellion loses itself, it is dissipated into 
nomenc.latures, .distinguished into classes of error, to which the jurist 
methodically bnngs to bear gualifications, criteria of classification and 
the casuistry of jurisprudence. As an inexorable conseguence, the Law-

What is left after the faithful have set about the task of interpretation 
IS a resounding political silence: the eternal present offragments that 
have been torn out of their history, arranged and re-arranged in the

Order of Reference and the Name of the Law 
i legal funbtion is, for Legendre, a function specified as speaking 
truth. The model for such speech is one of mediation or of 
transmission of a message that will absolve, I it comes from elsewhere, 
from above, and is 'presenced' below. The significance of such a 
dogmatic function relates firstly to the creation of a space or 
geography of truth; it is necessary to establish an architecture of truth, 
a structural site to which the attributes oflicit speech can be attached. 
, In Roman law that site or zero point is that of reference. It can be 
reconstructed first in terms of the Roman lawyers' conception of 
, judgment which is presented in the Digest as res judicata pro veritate 
hab,tur Uudgments take the place of truth). Truth guarantees the 
discourse ofthe Law; it is carried into it by the judge who 'wears the 
sacerdotal mask and takes up the sacred place of the untouchable, he 
represents the all powerful and absent Other ... it is not he who 
speaks but tHe Truth of the Law'.2 In literal terms, the judge imitates 
the emperor and becomes the mouthpiece, the empty vehicle, of the 
ancestral speech, namely that of Rome. 
In spite of the ambivalent reference of the term Rome, as both 
Church and Law (dua suntgenera ehristianorum) , it is important to locate 
the space of law's truth as a specific body of texts and as a highly 
particular method of reference. In structural terms,. 'the t~ut~ ~s .a 
place, by hypothesis it is the empty space where there IS nothmg If It IS 
not for theseitexts. This point recurs consistently, because dogmatlcs 
is consistent, it is the relationship to a truth which is resident in 
specified texts. Reference is reference to these texts. In other words, 
we are in the sphere of speaking texts? of texts that the law makes 
speak. In making the texts speak, the jurist labours to prolong the life 
of Rome, to carry into the future the imperialist text and the 
sovereignty that it harbours. Again referring to the Digest, Rome is the

of the profession and the legiti acy of its speech is precisely the

possessed of a hidden wisdom (arranajuris) and its task is to mediate

Law. Thus, Ihis recourse to genealogy, that is (0 say to the chart of the 
descent of names -
names of authors, names of texts, names of 
institutions -
presents itself, according to the scholastie labour of 
qualification, as the time or the times of the law. Such is inaugural 
discourse. J 
In positive terms, the theory of the name - of the need for all diings ' 
to have but one name or for all things to have their cause - is a . 
logomachy: it is speech that differ~ntiates truth from falsehood, and 
the name that identifies both person and honour. The history of the 
Western legal institution has been one of the authorisation of legal 
speech - from the ancient law of citations2 to the theory of precedent; 
it has been sufficient for the textual system to protect itself by . 
annihilating opposing speech. The history of its most awesome 
sanctions is equally reserved for those who through false speech, 
through heresy, divination, sorcery, treason, augury, witchcraft or 
other forms of immodest practice have trespassed beyond the name 
and have faced excommunication, damnalio memoriae (silencing of the 
name), the stake or the 'faggots' for their pains.] There is another side 
to the order of names. Genealogy establishes an order of descent 
whereby, in the name, the law seeks to read a lineage of names 
referring back to an ancestor or oldest name, that 'in whose name' the 
commentator speaks the law. A moment's reflection serves to indicate 
that while the name is presented as a presence, as logos or incarnate 
word, it has no referent beyond the descent of names, the genealogical 
tree itself. The name does not refer to a 'thing' outside the text but 
rather to a construction within it. If it is a matter of a family name,

then it is the name that lives on and not the person; the referent is 
either about to die or, in the case of the ancestors, is long dead. 1fit is 
the name ofa text, it can refer only to other texts within an order'ofthe 
descent or legitimacy of texts which is unified precisely by member~ 
ship of the system, by law in its mYlhic unity: as that which emanates 
through sacrifice, through the mouth of the emperor as vehicle' of the 
unseen and unspeakable deity, as image of the absent absolute. Ifit is 
a matter of the image, of dignity or office, then the name is again that 
which does not die (dignitas non morilur); it is a matter of the mystic 
body or function that survives and in surviving proves that its referent 
is the institution, the incorporeal belief in the order of law, the 'zero 
function'. It is not from a referent but rather, and ironically, from the 
mathematical sign for absence, from zero, that all genealogy must 
begin: 'the function zero simultaneously permits notification of the 
axiomatic Reference and at the same time makes possible that work of 
counting which renders genealogy effective' ,I

That genealogy, to be effective, must count from zero has a further 
curious consequence. In counting the place of the individual in the 
line of descent, the genealogist counts from zero to one, which in the 
Roman tradition:! means from ego to paler: ego is zero and pater is one. 
Ego, by consequence, is in law a lack, an absence that is filled by entry 
into the symbolic, by taking the place of the father, by inheritance of 
patria poleJio.J (the law off he father), or in feminine terms by accession 
to the place of the mother. Ego is zero in precisely the sense of nihil or 
nought; it is only in relation to the system of mathematical notation 
th~lt zero has a meaning and it is equally only in relation to the order of 
names, to the symbolic line or tree, that the ego becomes person, a 
subject at law. The living fiction of the I must be correlated to death,

In T,ansmjuion Legendre elaborates on the machematical significance of 
zero (pp. 244fI). Compare B. Rotman, Signifying Nothing: The Semiotics of Zero 
(I9S,), where zero is described as being a meta·sign, it signifies absenee and 
simultaneously the impossibility of conceiving of numbtrs as predicated upon 
anterior 'things': 'to make zero the origin of numba is to claim for all numbers, 
including the unit, the status of free un referenced signs. Not signs of something, 
not arithmoi, ceflainly not collections, and not abstractions of units considered as 
somehow external and prior to numbers, but signs produced by and within 
arithmetical notation' (p. 29)·

· Legendre's critique moves from the dogmatists to the institution. 
The term code (codtx), referring to written law, also connotes 
material support: institutional speech consistently refers to and relies 
upon ajuridicaJ text which is rigorously represented as being external 
to it. The science of law can be understood as operating a double 
reprc;sion, firstly in hiding the law in the past - though a past free of 
histmy - and secondly, through its refusal to talk of anything else but 
transmitted law. The innocence of the jurists is that of endlessly 
working and reworking the legitimate texts, dogma. The positive 
object of such study has traditionally been that of weighing and 
counting the authorities, pro and contra, distinguishing, analogising 
and generalising where necessary. In scientific terms, the object of 
such textual casuistry is hypothetical in that the logic of the text tales 
precedence over any substantive application: the law lies in wait for 
everyone, it is the 'dead letter' that can arrive at any time, it is the 
· theorem that can be applied to any triangle, the God that can drop in 
at any moment of sin. The fiction perpetrated is that ofa past that has 
· been integrated into a.o eternal present which repeats itsdfendlessly: 
the fiction which marks entry into the sphere of legal logic is that of 
'the legists' insistence on treating their system more gtometrico, in the 
style of a geometry, in the remarkable effort to efface from the past all 
traces ofhistory'.'2 Hence it is not that geometry (or law) does not have 
a past, but that its past does not count. The space created by this 
genuinely enigmatic form of communication and its medieval tools of 
practice is that of a reclusive tradition, of a specialism whose only 
knowledge is internal to its own discipline: 'it consists of ignoring the 
social importance of legal constructions, and encloses them in a sort of 
cloistered science. The law is a dumping ground, a refuse heap, and

the fiction of appearance, of semblance, by means of which the

For rhejurist, the law is to be read literally, namely to the exclusion

reading enforces is an amnesia as to that of which the message is the 
bearer: what is crucial is not what the message says but simply that it

of the text can be multiplied indefinitely: it is that which touches all 
(quod omn" tangit),' it is total law (totum ius), the culturewhich as legal 
subjects we breath~. Legendre gives the term a significant twist. As 
the zero point of all reference, the text inhabits another tim~ and 
another place, that of myth which shores up the whole edifice of 
culture. The text is a symbol of a universal territory (ius commune 
uni.mum), a geography unified by law. It is a space1containing all 
civilised people, a text and territory to which the 'subject either 
belongs or is expunged through the law of territory, of tm,o - a terror 
arbitrated by means of ius lerrendi or ius submolJendi, 'which can be 
translated loosely as the power to erase from the map. In Legendre's 
terms, 'we live in an artificial universe, in a universe of~ction, d~fin~d 
allegorically and underpinned by the discourse of the inarticulable, of 
that which can only be formulated ceremonially or poetically. That is 
the founding fact of geography and ofinternationallaw'.3 
The implications of such a dramatic and violent .textuality" are 
twofold. In the first instance, the text inaugurates a mental space of 
law; it puts into playa principle of adhesion that operates at the level 
of spirituality: in the classical canonist formula 'the Church does not 
inhabit a territory' (ecclesia non habet lenitorium)) it does not capture the 
subject through the corporeal arms of a specific locality, but through a 
terror of definition which knows no geographical boundaries. 5 The 
speech of law is directed at the soul, at the principium or moving 
principle of the subject, and for that end to be accomplished requires

that sets in motion by divination, by 'augury': by th~ reading of omens 
and signs. That it is liturgical in lits speech means that it is both 
public' and addressed to all, but also and more enigmatically that it 
creates a public sphere, a pure spare of the transmission of myth: • A 
liturgy has as its essential function lthat of delimiting this position. of 
marking the space of higher thing~, the celestial, the divine; bearing 
this mark of the space in which pm.-yer speaks, public discourse comes 
into playas a form of address and as a manner of leading humans to 
the space of pure legitimacy." iThe liturgical text is properly 
theogonic; it creates a universe an~ it is left to its commentators to 
administer its linguistic and semi+tic mysteries for in the words of

The second consequence of law ~s text devolves from the notion of 
reference itself In one sense the (iturgical speech is a solemnised4 
rhetoric, a method of persuasion through truth. In a less general sense 
it establishes not only the source but the meanings of such speech. 
The latter function of the text is the province of commentary, of the 
apparatus of interpretation through which the symbolic is disclosed 
and the text transmitted; that is, addressed and sent to its temporal 
audience. Just as truth is a reference to a text so also, for the 
commentators, meaning is the ref~rence ofa word, a name. Returning 
again to the question of the origin oflaw proposed in a fragment from 
Gaius in the Digest, the question was that of'from where does this name 
come?' and so to what does law refer? Gaius indicates the answer in 
terms ofa first word: 'without doubt, the strongest part [or function]

· image opens the eye5; it inscribes the law as both visible and seeing 
presence. In terms of Legendre's concern to develop ajurisprudential 
aesthetics, the art of law - ius est ars bani et aequi - is to be understood 
precisely as an art, as the construction ofa mirror image, a portrait or 
an icon that will represent the figure of the law in human form. That 
· image will serve both to represent and to reHect. It represents in a 
perfect form the face of power; it portrays the absent cause oflaw, the 
other time of authority, while equally reflecting back to the subject of 
law t.he image of its own otherness, the mask or persona of legal 
suQiectivity. There are thus two key dimensions to the aesthetics of 
law. The one concerns representation and is historicaL There is an 
unwritten history of the emblematic representation of power, the 
, iconography of the manner in which the institution has signified God 
and law. That history should aim to describe the manner in which law 
appears to and is recognised by its subjects: the image is the essential 
· medium oflaw's institutional presence, its condition of existence, its 
· manner of going within. The second issue is t~us onc ofreftection and 
is speculative in the fullest sense of being a question of mirroring the 
suQject. What binds the individual to law is a matter of appearance, of 
perception of oneself as an in5titutional being, as having a 
iP,efil,Ut'edplace and so of being ineluctably attached, bound, to one's 
to living in the shadow oflaw. Marin isolates and analyses well 
a power of representation in his study Portrail of th~ King: 
Representation as power and power as representation are a sacrament in 
image and a 'movement' in language where, exchanging their effects, the 
dazzling gaze and the admiring reading consume the radiant body of the 
monarch, the former by narrating his history in his portrait and the 
laller by contemplating one of his perfections in a narrative that 
eternalizes his manifestation. As we know, representation is at once the 
action of putting before one'!; eyes the quality of being a sign or person 
,hal holds the place of another, an image, a political body. and an empty 
coffin on which one stretches a cloth for a religious ceremony.' 
mask is, in other words, both a rhetorical and a spectral form; it 
moves, it bends, it persuades through visual as well as verbal signs. 
In more prosaic terms, the classical definition of public law was of 
that which 'looked at' or 'watched over' the Roman state (quod ad 
rei Romanae spectal). The visible law that allows the people 
be for the Jaw, to be affixed to it, to be designated primarily in relation to its 
ido!.,.'

The entry of the individual into the symbolic, the transition from 
zero to one, from lack to identity, is the condition of institutional 
existence, the capture of the subject by law. What is at stake in the 
order of reference and in the 'name of the law' is precisely the

the law) to the law of actions: the subject is instituted by the law of 
masks and through the bonds, the words of the law, comes to or, 
better, is led to act, to speak in the name of the pn'ncipium, the first and 
absolute Reference. Zero becomes through law the place of the actor, 
the site of subjectivity, the mask or persona of historical being in the 
theatre oftruth.2 In Nietzsche's deconstructive terminology, 'the real 
world becomes a myth' and truth a fiction, or, in the classical 
expression so well worked by Kantorowicl,.fictiofigura vtrilatis, fiction 
is the figure oftruth.3

law.

Certainly not! In abolishing the true world we have also abolished the world of 
appearance!' BaudriUard, SimulatiDns (19B3) translates Nietzsche's six stages of 
the hi.!Ilory oCan error into 'four successive stages of the image', the last of which is 
that the image 'bears no rdation to any reality whatsoever, it is its own pure 
simulacrum' but interprets this stage nostalgically, it is still defined by the 
absence of reality, the non-alignment of appearance with an anterior existence.

Following the order of the sentence, I' will move from fiction to

The lesson of the law is that no being is self.founding. The individual,

less than the science of birth in its classical acceptation of the 
reproduction of lineage through sexuality: 'why pose this equiva-

· speaking being and of that which underpins it: desire'.3 To institute 
.' human life, in other words, i!J not simply a question of the objective 
· designation of places, it is also a manipulation of desire: genealogy, 
through its imagery and its rhetoric, needs also to institute an 
unconscious adhesion, a reproduction of attachment, fidelity or 
political love. It is a double discourse, both fiction and figuration as 
the two faces of a single founding act. That act is the simultaneous 
portrayal both of origin and of its reproduction, of foundation and 
continuance, of birth and rebirth. In that the stake of the discourse of 
reproduction is nothing less than attachment itself, the bond of 
; subject to subjectivity, it is impossible to think the foundation of the

persuasion that engenders filiation. The act of origin or foundation

visual order of law ushers into the social realm 
classification for the simple reason that it is from the image - that is, 
from the specific emblem of place - that all counting of identity and 
difference begins. In Darwin's striking formula, all classification is 
genealogical: that is, it takes place by means of accounting descent in 
terms of genus and species. 1 In that very specific sense, the emblem 
produces reason but it does so in the paradoxical form of enigma. The 
enigma of representation is the duality of its reference and is most 
easily expressed in terms of the image as the memorial both of the 
person and of the ancestors. In one sense the image. thus marks an 
historical place in relation to the transmitted order of an atemporal 
knowledge. It is enigmatic because it is an erudite knowledge; it has to 
be interpreted according to the esoteric cartography of the truth. The 
image or device is thus frequently defined as a holy letter, a 
hieroglyph or dark symbol of knowledge. In a second sense, however, 
the order of causality can be reversed; the enigma is a subjective one, 
that of the presence of the dead in the living. The image can here be . 
understood as the creation of a spectral realm in which the living 
become haunted by the order of transmission, that of the perpetuityof 
tradition, the continuity of legal history itself. To be seen is the 
ambition of ghosts; to be remembered is the ambition of the dead.2 
In the latter sense of the emblem as image of an inherited myth, the 
enigma of transmission is that of a mirroring; the individual sees in 
the image a reflection of the self. The word 'emblem' is derived 
etymologically from the Greek emhalio, to throw within) and Legendre 
takes great pains to define the emblematic image as the mechanism 
whereby the signs of the law take hold of subjectivity and recreate ~he . 
closure of truth in the conscience of the individual. The image to 
which the individual is tied is that of the self as other, the self 
separate from itselfin the mirror of an imaginary law. Borrowing from '; 
the story of Narcissus, Legendre proposes the institution of the image 
as being the medium by which genealogy takcs effect or gets under the ' 
skin and leads the individual to recognise its fate as that of Ill.ask or ' 
player taking up a predetermined place in the symbolic enactment 
social life. To recognise oneself as other is to destroy thc self aHd

image of the subject in the mirror of the text and issues its demands as 
ifthey were the demands of the text: 'a society of humans functions on 
the basis of this mythological mirror, in whose glass it sees itselfcalled 
to account as if an other were making the demand'. 1 The lawyer 
interprets the demand, interprcts the text and transmits the myth, but 
only on the basis that it comes from elsewhere or represents the 
dogmatic logic of its absent, imagined, source. 
Conclusion 
The exposition of Legendre's work offered in the present chapter has 
been based upon two central themes, those of history as the history of 
law and of its metaphysical representation in the textual and plastic 
arts oflaw. The history in question is that of dogmatics, of the battle 
for truth conducted upon the various stages of Western law in terms of 
the diverse fictions of an origin, and the many images of the Source of 
legitimate social speech. To move· towards a conclusion is to pose 
directly the question of what that history means for us as the distant 
relatives or fading masks of a tradition that legal historians have 
, self-consciously chosen to forget and, in forgetting, to repeat in 
increasingly secular and barren forms. The animal (the living body and 
its history) is left on the road, so to speak, alongside the law as the 
reconstruction of human life, the living speech of social imagination. 
In morc specifically aesthetic terms, the question is that ofreturning

narrative representation of life. Its fiction, in other words, is a lived 
. fiction and to understand it in the order ofthe living is to analyse what

establishes the social body as a family, or in Cicero's words society is a 
marriage (conjugere), nature's model of the essential human union. 
The metaphor should be pursued insistently; the legitimacy of office 
or text or positive law has consistently been understood in terms of 
family. To be legitimate is'to belong to a line, to have a father (ex patTe 
natuJ), illegitimacy is to have no father, no legitimating lineage, while 
to be adopted is to be born a second time in imitation of nature 
(imilalio n4lurat), adoption being classically based upon [he fiction of 
the father as second mother. I The symbolic manipulation of kinship 
equally guarantees the history of law as succession, that is to say as 
precedent, derivation by lineage through antiquity and time (anti-
quitatt et temport) referring the text to the legend of an immemorial 
parent, the place of the ancestors. The law requires that we live as if " 
they were still present, as if they did not die: in biblical terms, 
'whoever has seen me, has seen the Father' Uohn 14:9)· 
In that the specific content of succession varies historically and as 
between jurisdictions, it is worth emphasising that the metaphors ofa 
common father and of the social body, or family tree, to which all 
offices belong, are symbolic spaces and cannot be interpreted· 
literally. Genealogy functions dogmatically, which is to say that it 
provides a normative guarantee of the legality of representation by 
reference to a symbolic manipulation of the places of speech. The 
paternal metaphor in consequence cannot be understood as referring 
to a masculine site of social language use but rather has to be 
approached as a function, as the principle of designation or reference 
itself whereby a mathematical relation or line is established (and 
reproduced) between sovereignty and the institutional place of ' 
speech. The relation is a causal one: all things come from the father (id ', 
tSI summum omnium quae sunt),2 'the father holds nothing in his own 
right, he represents, his being is his function . One must go further, the . 
father represents a representation, he represents what at the legal . 
level of the social represents the father as such .. _. the principle of . 
differentiation in the reproduction of the speaking being.'l Where it is .

. The fiction of social speech operates according to a hierarchy of 
legally designated places or 'sites of enunciation of discourse' . They 
speak as if they were legitimate; they speak 'in the name of the father 
or of the law, and the sexism or asymmetry of such speech is therefore 
not a matter of the male gender of representation, or the language-
personal pronouns - of causality, but of the construction of 
sexuality, of differentiation, as such. To speak in rhe name of the 
institution is to represent a message as if it belonged objectively to a 
text, to a logical space or legally designated authority and not to any 
political or social being. l The monarch, prime minister, 
or bureaucrat, in other words, is often a woman. It is their 
:.di"cour1;e the place and style of their speech, their persona and not

Where it is a question of institutional existence, the issue is not who you 
are but where you are. It is a question of placement and of the power of 
the place within the logic of descent: each indivjdual place on the line 
must be marked by an insignia, an emblem of blood or office, offamllyor 
status. In terms of the individual, this symbolic permutation from mere 
nature to the place of parent, to the place of the ancestor, takes the form 
of entry into the mask of identity. The other I is the space already 
prepared for each individual in the web of the social; it is a chronicle of a 
death foretold, a time that is inexorably marked in advance, a path that 
is patterned in the image of the forebears, an image to which reason. 
requires that we conform. In classical terms, we are created lin His 
image', we resemble the Fa ~ her and our face, our place in the line, is 
precisely a simulation of the dead cause of all causes: in my face, 
Athanasius announces. you will see the face of the Father. That image, 
imago or ancestral face, is also to be understood as the mark, the vestige, 
of the sovereign. the assigned or mapped poin( of power. The correlate i.s 
that without an insignia or emblem of where we are, without a face or 
mask. we cease to exist: only through the system of classification that the 
other inhabits can we locate a self. 
The task offinding ourselves is thus a geographical one; we need a

map of the social location of places to chart our being in the institution. 
We need a sense of aesthetics, an open eye, to recognise in the mirror the 
likeness of ourselves, or in Lacan's terms our predestined identification 
in the image. The process of such identification can be outlined in terms 
of a speculary structure. The social )X)Ssession of the subject is an 
emotive matter; it is to images that the subject adheres and it is by 
images that we are bound. The first law of the social is that the subject is 
held in place by an emblematic representation, an iconic sign that refers 
both to the power .)fthe system of places and to the individual point of 
reference, the obedient subject. In classical terms, it is the genealogical 
chart of accounted places in the line of descent that determines the place 
and the status of the individual: the annorial device or crest will indicate 
legitimacy and the rank of birth in a cryptic visual form, while in terms of 
societal being Church and Law existed to chart the descent of power 
from God to sovereign in the web of the law. Authority itself, however, 
c~uld never be represented in the icon; it was the invisible other, the 
absent source before which the human stood helpless and to which the 
mortals would offer their sacrifices. The sacred involves sacrifice, the 
very specific sacrifice of each new generation that must be made to 
. r~cognise the awful presence of God by means of representation: the 
symbolic sacrifice of Isaac or later and differently of Christ is re- enacted 
before the altar at Mass. The altar is itself the medium or relay of 
s;lcrifice; it is before the altar that the ego symbolically slips into the 
realm of otherness and, in recognising the substantial presence of God, 
recognises also its own destiny, its destination, its terminal point, the last 
dot on the screen. 
God died some time ago. That God is dead simply means that the 
ancestor of power eventually died. It would appear, however, that 
God left a will; he had acted as a witness, he died testate and 
bequeathed or passed on the principle of absolute power to his 
successors. The Law is now resident not in the mouth of Cod but in 
the contemporary system of simulation; the technological system of 
relay and screen now weaves the web of life in the form of faith in 
unlimited exchange. The faithful kneel before the monitor, the screen 
that relays futures prices in a bar in Stockholm, in a restaurant in 
London, in an airport lounge in Chicago, the teletext, the video, the

The iconography oflaw is the study of the sacral representation of 
law. Its concern is with the Jogic of the image both as model or 
prototype and as a specific picture of spatial organisation, of power in 
a corporeal form. The image of Leviathan, to take one example from 
the cover of the first edition of Hobbes' treatise, shows Leviathan as a 
massive body composed of innumerable human forms. All faces 
within the picture are [Urned wwards the crowned head of Leviathan, 
the mortal God who stands with staff and sword in his outstretched 
hands over a Church-infested globe. Other less crude representations 
symbolise terrestrial power in terms of an all~seeing eyc, or of a mouth 
devouring the law books while the world or the human heart hangs on 
a thread held by the enigmatic hand of the emperor. While the precise 
imagery varies, the function of the icon can be traced into the history 
of the law of images. What is at stake in that aesthetic history is the 
· genealogical representation of descent, both as political power and as 
· subjective place. As regards the former, thr icon, from all-seeing eye 
to the much later image of the Crown - defined by Coke as the 
hieroglyph of all the laws- is there to establish the realm of the law as 
a ceremonial or ritual site of action, The image authenticates the law 
as the fiction or theatre of truth, as ritual in the Latin sense ornlus, as 
the communication of divine and human law. As regards legal 
subjectivity, the image is only legally effective as an emblem, as the 
· authentic inscription or mark of social place and office. In the same 
manner that the icon marks the social space of liturgical speech, the 
emblem of office and the family device prove the entry of the 
individual into the social body; they are the signs that prove 
· membership or filiation within the formal order of the institution as 
family, polis and law.

It is before the altar of the early saxon cathedral in Wllnche,"e.: 
before the reja of lances in Velasquez's Surrender of Breda, before 
becoming other of death, that the subject presents its last will, 
testament to future generations. Once it has become other,

contract, enclosing and destining the will to the future. Self and

Ot:-twcen necessity and chance, the line takes the form of a simulated 
wall' it is a barrier or screen against placelessness and makes use of 
the frame to build a blockade from top to bottom and from right to 
lelt. Here the artist thus poses the question of the enclosure of mental 
space, the framing of vision and the building, the structure, of the 
dream become life, become real. Once inside the frame, the frame no 
longer exists: it transpires to have been hallucination; it was always 
only a quasi-stable structure, a collapsible space -li~e a bed, ~ tent, 
an imaginary tent, a phallus - a moveable body. It IS a questlon of 
strategy that may be approached by means of the function of 
seduction: the frame institutes life, but how lively is life? What is its 
tone, its colour, and what are its forms of desire? Is there water? Is 
there love?

Conclusion 
The exposition of L egendre's work offered in the present ehapler has 
been based upon cwo central themes, those of history as the history of 
law and of its· m etaphysical representafion in the textual and plastic 
o(1aw. The history in question is that of dogma tics. ofche battle 
truth conducted upon the various stages of Western law in terms of 
diverse nCljon$ oran origin, and the many images of the source of 
social speech. To move towards a conclusion is to pose 
'di,'ectiv the question of what that history means for us as the d;stanl

social: let us examine rationality and structure,' order and perfection. 
The frame seen from the inside is pure order; its symbol is the circle, 
the ring which has neilher outside nor any inlernal disturbance. On 
the left, a perfectly blocked-up circle, no faults, no threats; signed and 
sealed the unconscious can be forgotten - it no longer exists. On the 
right, the conscious circle, empty, gold-lined (an aura), impregnable, 
dead. The created circle, the full circle, encloses inert space: to be 
within the ring is to be held, but what is held is no longer a self, it is 
simply the idea of the self which exists only because of the ring. Once 
in the ring. the self disintegrates into order; it is constructed in 
military fashion: lours is nOl to reason why' but simply to obey orders 
and so to carry out the ultimate oblivion of communication that 
consists of patrolling the borders and letting nothing and no one 
through. 
To understand the two rings is to understand this paradoxical 
relationship between border and homeland, between exclusion zone 
and daily life. Ultramodernity is the most extreme known form of 
universal rational manipulation. Everyone who counts has a task and 
a place, a connection and an exit point. The greater the degree of 
order - of meaningless activity - the greater the need for militarised 
and regimented control.ofspace to allow the communications to flow. 
Star Wars is necessary because all space is potentially a threat, an 
object of mapping and of imaginary manipulations: space becomes 
the residual site of an infinitely impenetrable demand; it is in its waya 
total insecurity, the antithesis of matter and so the ever present 
(potential) demise of all property, the last spin of Fortuna's wheel.

The marriage portrayed is thus comprehensible as one between the 
external extreme of military precision and the internal extreme of 
dispossessed identity. This is properly an aesthetics of disappearance] 
which sees in the symbolics of identity a vacuum side by side with a 
wall: the most that could be hoped for from joining the one to the other 
would be an exorbitant constipation, a total inability to let go. Such is 
thc metaphor of marriage, a metaphor of society insofar as ~ociety is 
itself a marriage of men, a conjunction (conjugtrt) according to 
nalUre's most explicit category of union. The marriage, however, 
leaves us cold, selfless, lost through being found. Let us simply note 
thaI, while the ring holds us implacably, the ring is also the sound of 
the tclephone: could it be that there is someone new at the end of the 
line? Or might it also be the ring that makes us disappear? 
Engagement or wedding? Fascination or fall? Is there anyone at the 
end of the line? Is there anyone there? Hello? 
Figure 9.4: Into a Controlled Orbit 
The circle is also the representation of an eye, the principle of vision 
around which Bentham most famously constructed the rational 
priwn, the panopticon. From a single central point of control it is 
possible to see every cell and through the threat of visibility to control 
the inmates by means of the fear of being watched, ofbting seen. Ifwe 
translate the circle into the orbit of Figure 9.4, the principle of 
par.opticism, oran omnivoyant eye, is displaced by a notated space, a 
blank canvas is marked externally by a series of figures circulating 
around and also supporting the open and blank territory of the 
network. Here the spatial quality of comrol is presented in its most 
bleak and immediate form: the individual figures, the chairs lhat in 
the rhetoric of cinema represent private identity, private space, are in 
orbit around a blank and imageless screen. The network or circuit 
th;")ugh which the full panoply of communications passes no longer 
needs any dimension of theatre or of seduction; it is brute space and 
signa;s with equally brutality in the form of stark visibility; it is there

greater value than truth,3 Legendre insists additionally upon 
primacy of the poetic and aesthetic function over that of reason. To 
begin again, to create, is the most pressing task of critical reason as ' 
applied to contemporary law. For that task to be possible literature 
must play the role of law,4 it must act poetically, deconstructively, 
from a distance that is not without the law but is buried decp within

Introduction: Laws of Movement 
The history of the common law has always been a history of 
· movement, ofa wandering nomos, a narrative of itinerant justice and 
itine,arlt justices. Its movement has been both literal a':1d meta-
phorical, a question of a peripatetic court and also of laws of 
· transmission of legal knowledge: moveable bodies become moveable 
: signs. Any intelligent discussion of the common law tradition should 
· look to the multiple senses of legal transmission and consider the 
various spatial and temporal trajectories of passage of legal know-
ledge. Those trajectories, as traced in this study, can be framed in 
diverse ways: they form a narrative of movement from theology to 
· law, ftom the sedimented to the sedentary, from the premodern to the 
postmodern, a nar.t;ative of changing forms of legal organisation or 
· governance of bach physical geography and mental territories. At the 
level of language, the trajectory is from rltuals of repetition to 
ceremonies of inscriptioll) from an oral hermeneutics of the legal 
voice, the itx ltrrat, to the optical and unconscious power of the visual 
text. from an hallucinating memory and lucinating law! to a 
scriptural monologue of instantaneous facsimiles. Where the law was 
a form of doing things, a way of life, a note or bond of habitual 
practices and habitual servitudes, it became an externalised control of 
circulation, a sedimentation and striation of movement, an exter-
To hallucinate has its root in the Latin aiucinor, 10 wander in mind, to dream, 
to rave. Its connotations are utopian and geographic, the hallucination follows a 
different path, it gets lost according to the established map. We may also note that 
it is bodily, the hallucination is not externally generated, it d~s not obey the 
causal norm, but it is nonetheless an embodied vision, an intensive optical 
trajectory rather than an extensive projection.

side. Rt':duced to its metaphorical constituent, the allusion to diabolical 
action places fascination on the side of madness, there where the 
symbolic finds its efficiency, its function being to dismiss and to r~lieve. 
Someone who passes to the other side, over the humanised space of 
legalised speech and sigm, such a person is mad. To fascinate, such is the 
function of power at the level of social insanity.1 
Because we see ourselves in the screen, it holds us, fascinated,. 
entranced frozen into immobility in the very same moment that we 
endlessly ~rbit the points of the globe. 
'. 
The metaphor of a diabolical outside helps to locate the key 
element of that which keeps us within. It is belief that holds the 
satellite in orbit and on course. It cannot be knowledge because it is 
precisely an external point that holds the system up; it is zero that 
inaugurates counting and projection that constitutes and coheres the 
map. The spatial reality of the social orbit is a reality only for those 
within the frame and oftne territory; it is the life that has already been 
invaded that belongs to the system. The annexed module clings to the 
points of the map or passes over the screen as ifit were real because to. 
believe otherwise would be to face up to the dissolution of art, its:, 
emergence as a pure market, a space of tokens. That the space of · 
reason is blank simply serves to remind us that it is no morc than a 
function, a structural principle of simulation to which can be added : 
any number of relations, a white screen awaitin~ th~ conting.ent 
projections of uhramodernist rationality, its publicity, Its advertISe· 
ments, its Hollywood cinema, its journalism of the self. Sparse to the 
limit, the figure has to be approached in terms of perspective, in terms ' 
ofa geometric surface, a configuration of relations, a pointless control, 
a meaningless algebra. The figure itself reflects the frame of the 
viewer; it returns the language. the stare, of its fascinated victims. I tis 
too harsh to be taken seriously, too vacant to be dissir.lUlated. It 
represents no more than the internal spacing of its components. It 
simulates nor in the form of thanalor, life in the mask of death. h acts 
out structurally the absence of escape and poses the essential question 
as a nihilistic one, that of how to experience, how to live or act out, the .' 
illusion of a work without parameters, memorials or extension.' 
Controlled orbit thus expresses a horror. The chairs orbit a blank 
canvas, a spectre, a network. Each space is located by reference to a 
whiteness, a quality that offers nothing, a simple screen - imageless,

individualised space is immediately and uncompromisingly connec· 
ted to each other space; it shares with each other not simply 
rela~ionality but also fixity or fascination, the complete lack of 
su~stance as will, the emptiness of rdation, the blankness of space,

but of fragmentation brought about by an actuarially based demo·

strip 91 becomes pure motion again, part of the great American 
ec.stasy of communication, part of militarised space. 
The ultramodern ecstasy of communication is an ecstasy oflin~ar 
speed. I [n the race to be ahead, it is the connection that is more 
important than the destination, and being in the system, being 
'hooked UP', is of far greater significance than knowing what the 
system is for. In the geometry of the social, the message will always 
come down the line. The line will link us to the exchange. So long as 
the phone is on, the satellite dish is in position, the computer 'on line' 
or the aerial rigged, then we can belong, we are part of the system and 
the images will arrive and we will have been remembered, remem-
bered, that is, through the very act of reception, through being 
recipients, terminal points, nodes or nomads. Interesting, then, that 
we must be in place to receive the ecstatic communiction. Our orders 
will come down the line and only then will the connection bc made, 
only then will we be off, forward march into the beyond, down the 
line: whether it is liquid crystal, fibre optic, air wave or the decadently 
mechanical tarmac track of the motorway, it is always a question of 
getting in line, joining the system. being seen and being on the move. 
The postmodern condition with which the present chapler is 
concerned is onc of resistance, one in which the tables are lO be turn~d 
and rather than being on track, linked in, connected to the exchange 
and remembered by the authorities, we turn to look at the image of 
ourselves that the system presents. It is after all essentially the 
ambition of ghosts to be seen and of the dead to be remembered: lor 
the living it is a matter of letting the body remember and then of 
putting the ghosts to rest. 2 
To look at our image in the mirror of the social is an impossible 
task. Ifultra·modernity is wholly concerned with exchange, with the 
exchange of nothing, the consumption of images and the accumula· 
tion of money to make such possible, then the artist is left to portra)· a

theory, of the ancient term imago ~ (p. 2).

living death, an image or mask that is the likenessofan empty self, a 
consumer, a bank account, a shattered glass. l Only the mirror itself, 
the system or network as global medium, as endless relay, as law, 
holds the subject in place: only by endlessly sending it on can the 
image remain whole. To take the mask apart will simply reveal an 
empty place, a death: it will reveal only that life might now be no more 
and no less than a web of ceremonial relationships, a ritual exchange 
of masks that holds together something with no substance, something 
that is an already existent ruin. an object that carries its principle of 
disintegration on its surface, on its sleeve, on its skin. The exchange is 
thus with someone without qualities, with the detritus of the subject, 
nothing and no one, pure screen. It is on screen that we live and on 
screen that we die, no longer project but projection, images amongst 
images, shadows of the shade or flies in the web. To stop and examine 
our image raises the possibility that each individual may therein 
recognise his or her death, will see reflected in the mirror a frozen 
identity, a life trapped in the web and growing cold, a mask that has 
taken root and become the face, an image or likeness of the self 
stretched over a single point that exists simply to mark the time and 
account the place. 
The theme is a rich one and in visual terms it finds a wide variety of 
representations in the nomadic images here selected from the work of 
the artist and film maker David Walliker. It is a· work devoted to 
depicting the social forms of human absence in the unrelenting terms 
of the logic of placement, the power of projection and the masks in 
which we live and die. It is an art of the outside. an art that dares to 
look in and question the loss of will that results from a geometry - a 
political economy - of pure circulation. hs motifs are acute and 
repetitive, sacrificial and psychoanalytic. It can be presented as a 
narrative of fear. It can be presented too as an iconography of 
seduction in which fear is alleviated or evaded by sacrifice, by entry 
into the controlled orbit of exchange, by stepping into the mirror and 
leaving life behind -life is simply what the other does. Life is invisible) 
it escapes the image, it is other in the sense that it cannot be presented 
but only represented through likeness to an absent form. In the world

Repetition would here signal that the escape was imaginary: the 
geom~try of social space is one which maps and freezes motion; there 
is in reality no means of escape other than escape into the same. Here 
we are forced (0 concede that the only escape is one that takes us into

spatial akinesia in which each new, frozen space exhibits all the 
symptoms and horror of being identical with those that have passed. 
As in Figure 9.4, space runs out by virtue of redundancy; its total 
encroachment, its encyclopedic destructiveness, simply works to 
organise and divide, cohere and separate, according to laws of 
distribution, of regions and zones that are interchangeable, repli. 
cable, familiar, identical. The terroristic incursion of the same, the 
all-devouring silence of the surface, indicates not that time has run its 
course but that there is nowhere left to go. Open the cage by all means 
because all that is left in the mapped space of the social is a movement 
which moves not and a going which goes not; these are the mementoes 
of ultramodcrnity which can initially be experienced only as a

terror of the surface, of the abyss of the same. This is 
catatonia; the perception of receding space has imploded the 
possibility of action. 
Figure 9.6: The Contract 
The show ends with the most dramatic and ironic image of all: the 
contract. Rousseau, the author of the contract, has died. An admirer, a 
private citizen, builds a park outside Paris to house Rousseau's tomb on 
an island in an artificial lake. The tomb will memorise the author of the 
social contract as a hero of the People, as the author of the first modernist 
contract, a consensual and democratic agreement between equals or, in 
legal terms, a considered and so wholly fictive bilateral deed. Later the 
state comes to recognise Rousseau, both as hero and as threat, and his 
body is removed from the tomb and taken to the Pantheon in central 
Paris: the state appropriates the contract and symbolically removes the 
body, the text, from the periphery to the centre, from the private domain 
to that of the law. The tomb no longer contains Rousseau's body, only 
the memorial remains in a park that has become a campsite and is now 
bordered by two motorways. In the ecstasy of ultramodern communi-
cation, we no longer need reminders of death, there are no fixed points, 
there is no meaningful history, no one looks at the tomb or remembers 
the dead. That sort of history would slow down the network, obstruct the 
arterial circulation, delay the communication. And if we wished to 
h:mour the dead, to look at the tomb, the vestige of presence, the 
monumental trace, then it is as well to be reminded that even in death 
Rousseau is absent a second time in that the tomb lacks even the 
presence, the trace of that absence. In death he has been moved outside 
the contract; he is no longer there, no longer held to his word or bound to 
the agreement. The contract, like its author, has been moved,

out. 
The theme is a topical one in that we currendy celebrate the 
bicentennial of the French Revolution. Two hundred years on and the 
revolution has come full circle, it has revolved, we are back where we 
were and forced in the dawning of ultra modernity to question again 
the sociality of the contract. The circle within which the tomb is 
contained may here be taken to imply a cycle, a coming around again

computerised cash dispenser on the street ·corner or in the home. It 
screens us, it ensures our security pass, it monitors and lets us in via 
an individualised code, a codex or support, a combination of numbers 
that identify and let us pass as encoded beings. The Altar Ego of 
Figure 9.1 plays precisely upon the ambiguity of altar and alter, of 
screen and other, as they are to be witnessed in the postmodern age as 
: pastiche of the personal incorporated into a massive screen of 
technological debris that both controls and consumes us. It is debris 
· that binds us to a panicular soil, to a terri wry , a place, to Earth, to 
Mars, to Kansas. 
The image of Altar Ego is no longer the classically figurative altar 
screen but rather a massive montage, an indecorous collage of 
artificial materials and plastic remains. The artist who stops and 
breaks the spell of the mirror, of the screen to which we are glued, has 
to face the reality of a sociality transfigured into pure machination, 
pure war: 1 this is not an interesting plact. The ahar screen presented 
in Figure g.1 is thus insubstantial; it is simply a screen erected to 
:.-represent relay and network through plastic tubes, random colours 
and broken glass. The individual elements - numbers, letters, chairs, 
hoops and mirrors- have no identity outside of the collage itself: they 
exist only in relation to the relay of the whole, the jumbled network 
labelled in the lower left-hand corner 'hell', the final destination of 
Narcissus or the residence of the human soul. the unconscious that 
sits opposite a series of numbers on the right, the conscious rationality 
of the social as an actuarial system.1 When the subject slips across the 
altar to the screen, it sacrifices the unfonncd or inchoate sense of self, 
the realm of poetic dialogue or personal myth, and replaces it with an 
inherited rationality of the economics of risk and the logic of 
demographic control - of governmentality. 3

true word or, in the terms of Roman law, by our faith in 1I'1Strurner," 
(de fide in.rJrumentorum). If we move to the terms of the social contl'act 
itself, it too transpires to be an act offaith, an ambivalent trace 
attempts to bring the People l;>efore the Law and lead them to speak. 
In the Rousseauite (radition contracts are to be served, they ensla,ve ' 
(pacta sunl seroandaL and it is well to remember this process of 
enslavement when it comes to the question of who the People are in,' 
relation to the word of the law. The social contract is far from being" 
the demoCTatic document that it first appeared to be: it places on 
record an agreement that never took place, it memorialises the dead 
for something that they did not do, it invokes not the people but rather 
the People as fictively represented in the mouth of the Father or the 
word of God: 'The legislator therefore, being unable to appeal to 
either force or reason, must have recourse to an authority of a different 
order, capable of constraining without violence, and persuading 
without convincing ... This is what has, in all ages, compelled the 
fathers of nations to have recourse to divine intervention and to credit 
the gods with thd r own wisdom.' The contract is put in the mouth of 
the People, it is imposed, i. is placed upon them by the fathers because 
'it is not anybody who can make the gods speak'. 1 The trace or 
contractual writing is a memory of the absolute Other; it is fiction as 
truth and truth as law, a trace defying death in the cold prose of the 
instrument. The Contract is before the law, it constitutes the People, 
but we must accept that in the context of this perfect circularity of 
argument the People do not exist, their unity and power is simply a 
vestige of the divine will, of the first and last testament. 
Returning to Figure 9.6, the contract may be posed as a site of self-
reference, a communication on terms of its own which Rousseau 
depicted as a metaphysical unity: it was always everything that it 
should be, it is logos or incarnate word, a People present (0 itself and so 
non-existent save as traces of an immaculate idea, as ghosts haunted 
by a contract, spectres of something already written and chewed over 
many times. The island on which the tomb is housed is thus 
appropriately a utopia, a fiction or non-place; the eternally present 
destination of the contract is the myth of law, an island where we are 
made whole by becoming the People, servants of the state. Recalling 
the curious legal rule that a contract is formed the moment that the 
letter of acceptance is placed in the hands of the post, Figure 9.6 is 
I Rousseau, Tht SociaL Contract (19'3 edn), pp. 37-8.

accompanied by a repetitive playing of the last post: the military 
signal that accompanies the end of the day and the burying of the 
dead. Here the contract is 'put out', it is a contract of assassination, it 
convenes the People as a representation and as an instrument; the 
People are only the People when quiescent, when they serve the 
contract as living tools, when they die before the letter of the law, 
But Rousseau is not there. Rousseau has slipped away. Jean-
J~lcques is no longer around; even his tomb is empty. For a 
postmodern reading, the contract is always subject to the possibility 
that it will be intercepted, that it will not arrive at its destination. The 
absence of Rousseau's remains from their final resting place suggests 
a further irony and another possibility. At one level the contract is a 
confession and once a will is confessed it is exculpated, made free. In 
contractual terms, the artist has depicted Rousseau as 'moon-
lighting >: for the postmodern Rousseau the contract was a sin 
confessed, a penance whose dues have now been paid. Far from 
n:maining in the frame or staying within the contract, Rousseau has 
found alternative employment: that Rousseau is moonlighting means 
that he is now working off the record, both erasing the contract and 
working on the outside, in the black economy, outwith the law. In the 
imagery of the postmodern, working off the record suggests erasure of 
the (ape, free play in a world made strange, a glimpse of knowledge on 
the outside.

natural law and the afterlife of the soul. The universal principle by 
which we hang together is now no more vivid than an infinity of 
products made to be thrown away; its zero point is simply repression, 
fear ofba'nkruptcy, of the scrap heap. To take it further, the death of 
God to which the title refers is a denial of God's being alive, an 
aesthetics of disappearance: 'the idea [is] that the disapJXarance of 
something is never objective, never final ... it always involves a sort 
of challenge, a questioning, and consequently an act of seduction' ,I 
The seduction is a challenge to the vanished idea, an attempt to play 
with it, to question its traces, the marks that it has }tfl behind in the 
form of excess. But if we call God to question, to play, we find in the 
place of God the litter of industrial waste as the mark of technological 
reason. 
The strategy of the frame is to make us ignore it. Why, raise 
metaphysical questions if they simply summon the debris of past 
pleasures and intimidatingly remind us of our destiny as junk 
amorigst ever increa5ing piles of junk? Beuer to build a wall, to 
acknowledge the need to keep the metaphysical out, to expel the zero 
point from our consciousness while leaving the unconscious to fight its 
own battles in the hell below, the hell within. We know our destiny 
but we only succeed if we forget it. We are better competitors, in other 
words, if we keep it to ourselves and live in the illusion of an ordered 
segment of the map. That life tends to disorder is no bar to the 
intrinsically meaningless construction of barriers against the great 
outside within, against the other. It is best, in the final account of 
industrial reason,just to Jive. It is best not to ask why or from where 
the institutions of life have come. After all, we have a map, we know 
where we are; the map may not correspond to anything, it may be a 
pure map, a fiction, a pretence, but who cares? A man or a woman, 
who cares? The map will still name the streets and lead us to the bank 
or to the teller J while the daily news will remind us of the day's 
programmes and oflinle else. To digress .momentarily, this is life as 
punishment, as a penal colony. 
Within the frame, the image is startlingly clear. In the face afchaos, 
humanity builds nothing more interesting than walls, scrcens against 
disorder, scars against memory. sites of lamentation, monuments to 
firing squads, to eros and blood: these are memorials of past feeling, of 
lost emotion, of spent passion. On the left a morass of bricks,

individual blocks that appear to be falling together. They have 
nothing to hold on to, they are unchartcd, disordered and, from the 
perspective of the wall, they arc helpless. On the left, the site of the 
unconscious, the sinister or diabolical 'without,' the repressed 
I though, disturbingly enough, this without is still fully within the 
frame. It is from here that we find the materials with whtc~ · to build 
the wall, to construct the barrier against nothingness which will 
ensure our civility. Civilhy and reason, however, are nothing nlore 
than a screen, for to the right is empty space: the purpose of the 
operation appears eventually to have been limited to holding bade, to 
containment. The wall docs not protect anything; the order it encloses 
is contentless, cleared ground and nothing more. Reason has expelled 
everything, leaving us with the magnificent equation that to live is to 
. . die; to live would be to join the vcry chaos that the mask was erected to 
exile, to pUI without to hold within. Alternatively, we could devote life 
to the pure task of exclusion, to holding the barrier in place, to keeping 
the mask fixed, even though this would then be the only purpose, the 
only task, of life: delay, postponement or meaningless and finite 
continuance. To be framed is also to be set up for a crime that one did 
not commit, to be punished for something that one did not do: 
recollecting Bentham, 'let the offender, while produced for the 
purpose of punishment, be made to wear a mask'. He continues 
instructively: 'the air of mystery that such a contrivance will throw 
over the scene wHl contribute in a great degree to fix the attention by 
the curiosity it will excite, and the terror it will inspire" - guiltless, it 
might be said, but none the less subject 10 the dual principles of 
fascination and terror, fixation and fear.

Hell, which used to be other people, is now the self, the unconscious in 
which we repress our fear offrcedom. The image afFigure 9.2 was of 
an unconscious hell of falling bricks. Hell was that place where there 
is nothing left to hold on to, no structures, nothing built, pure idea- in 
which case, out with the map:fictio figura verilatis, ficlion is the figure of 
. truth. In Figure 9.3 we are drawn into the realm afreason and of the

isolated satellites with an absolute assurance or total lOgIC which IS all 
the more terrifying for being free of any qualities, free of any subs t~nce

upon a clairvoyance of power or total marking and tra~kmg o~ vIsIble

To the descriptive quality of Figure 9.4 certain interpretations need 
to be added. The notation of space so starkly depicted ~n terms or the 
blank screen has a quality of pure mathematics. No system of 
enumeration or of counting is self-founding; its absolute reference is 
necessarily an external point, a foundational fiction which has 
classically taken the political form of God or law and the mathe-
matical form of nought or zero as icons of the origin. The etymology of 
zero derives from 'cipher', meaning void and by extension something 
unreal at the basis of thought. In strict mathematical terms, the 
cipher refers to the absence of any other signs and not to the non-
presence of any real thing. I n that peculiar sense it is better depicted 
as the vanishing point than as mere nullity, for the cipher is also a 
secret writing, a coded message in an u"lknown script that can be 
deciphered as a founding symbol that paradoxically symboHses the 
absence or impossibility ofabsolutc reference. Thc~e are only systems 
of notation and it is precisely nothing, empty space, that is notched or 
marked or mapped by the system itself. J The paradox is that the 
impossibility of referl".J'lce itself refers to a point beyond which we 
cannot go; it refers to the limit of reference, the extremity of 
externality, the point of difference that constitutes the border, the 
edge of the frame beyond which lies the territory of death, the pure 
outside orall that is thrown away. Let it simply be noted that the zero 
point is also a secret script, a message in cipher that reminds us that 
disappearance is never final, it is never objective, it leaves traces and 
it is for the outsider to track those traces, to disencrypt, to play the role 
. of zero's other or God's opponent, Lucifer (luxJtrrt). 
The opposition between light and dark, God. and Devil, classically 
maps a series of figures of inside and outside that have traditionally 
structured the divisions of the law, particularly those of the public and 
private, truth and heresy. The diabolic is simply a reference to that 
which is outside: where the emblem (emba/lo) throws within, the Devil 
. (diaboIQs) throws out; the Devi) is all that has been discarded, exiled, 
jettisoned. It is, in political terms, the point of no return and 
simultaneously the realm of unbelief, beyond belief. It is a question 
both of territory and of belief: 
[IJt is sufficient to return to the etymology to provide an idea of the 
[diabolical]. From the Greek diabolikos .. . it is a question of this: of 
getting away with it, of throwing into the distance, of passing to theather

LANGUAGE, IMAGE, SIGN AND COMMON LAW 
Finally, it is the absolutism ofa direct relation between module and' 
system, between unit and exchange, satellite and orbital control, that 
figure 9.4 depicts. The tyranny of the ultramodern is simply its 
directness, its efficiency; it leaves no room for interpretation, no room 
for the dual discourse of conscious and unconscious; it is a self-
equilibrated system which abolishes all excess of meaning, leaving 
only the message remorselessly relayed thrnugh the various 
exchanges of ultramodern rationality. That the President speaks as 
my President, that the Corporation personalises its message, obscur~s 
the purely logical function of place by presenting in its stead a fictively 
compassionate individuality, a confidence trick which hides the fact 
that far from being a personal discourse this is the voice of universal 
functions that have precisely transposed the individual into the 
cellular universality of modular orbit: 
Where it is a question of the systematic personalisation of commercial 
messages, two discourses are confounded that have nothing in common 
... this practice, which summons the subject of speech in the name of a 
benevolent love, smashes the subject, refusing,it all space of speech and 
constitutes the beginning of a massive fraud. To leave the governed 
masses to understand that power is something other than a logil:al 
function, to be treated as such, to be invested and reinvested endlessly 
through the brutal game of political and diplomatic protocols, is simply 
to modernise the most radical methods of slavery. I 
The tyranny of the network abolishes both interpretation and 
enigma; its reality is of a systemic logic, a total control that is free of 
interference, free of all but the most trivial images of personal is at ion. 
Looked at long and hard, it is white space, a terrifying territorial 
control, blank but secure: a death bound subjectivity.2 
Figure 9.5: The Parrot and the Snake 
One of the oldest of military tactics and of strategies of military 
architecture takes the form of circles, towers or fortified hills. The unit 
forms into a ring and that way can see and defend itsdffrom all sides 
in the most economic of manners. The oldest tactic of social discourse 
is that of repetition, another circularity in that the completed

statement returns us to a variant of the original: the solemnised 
discourse of power classically takes the form of ritual speech that 
plays the role oflaw by inaugurating a discursive space within which 
the ever present and self-present time of myth can repeat itself in the 
form of an authoritative word. Figure g.sjuxtaposes repetition with 
desir~ in an image that is open to both positive and negative, 
optimistic and pessimistic, interpretations. An empty cage, a black 
cloth, an open door and a serpentine repetition of an image of desire 
together make up a sculpture that represents both the imprisonment 
of the (amal, of eros, of the will, and its potential escape, the route out 
by means of the images of desire. 
The elements of this relatively simple juxtaposition can be depicted 
rapidly. At the centre is a white circle on which stands a parrot cage 
half covered with a black cloth. The parrot, the symbol ofrepetition 
parexallmce, has escaped the cage; the bird has flown and the viewer is 
left to speculate upon a deserted space, a site of repetition that is 
empty, as though the conjurer had drawn back the cloth to reveal a 
magical disappearance: look, no bird. It might equally be the 
hangman's cloth, or the black cloth of execution put on by thejudge to 
announce the sentence of death, but the prisoner has escaped: after a 
lifetin.e of repetition the parrot has flown. The death sentence hangs 
in the air; it would be best, therefore, not to return to the cage, to the 
site of imprisonment, but rather to stay outside. The outside, 
encircling the cage in the form of a snake, is the image of the serpent, 
of illicit knowledge and proliferating and repeated desire. The snake 
alone in the image has colour and it curls away and points beyond. 
From the nowhere of identity we may escape to an outside of desire; 
from a repetition that repeats our servitude we may move to a 
repetition of desire that emphasises the possibility and, indeed, the 
availability of the outside. Through desire the ide-ntical may leave the 
garde-n, the frame, and learn to speak for itself. 
The black cloth may also represent a veil that has been removed, a 
screen drawn back. In a more pessimistic terminology, it may be 
interpreted as revealing a realm of the departed and simultaneously a 
dual structure of repetition, an initiation into the tyranny of political 
love. The principle of repetition reveals itself as a sign of death; the 
mask, the sanctum sanetorum, is empty - it is simply an abandoned place 
and no more. Ifthe place is both internally and externally subject to 
relentless repetition, we might well conclude that the secret unveiled 
is one of equivalence: both inside and outside the same law prevails.

ofthe question of the social, the question of the contract and of that to 
which or by which we are contracted. As with any contract, we can 
offer an interpretation only in the light of the varying contexts in 
which the contract is produced. In the present context, the contract is 
emblematic; we are offered a painting depicting a memorial caged in 
on an island, a circle or utopia, I a slightly unreal tomb surrounded by 
unnatural natural bars - trees - and further surrounded by a gap and 
then by neo-classical columns. We may begin the interpretation by 
examining the representation of the contract, a question of perspec· 
tive that is posed in the juxtaposition of classical and contemporary, 
origin and image,2 
Returning to the ,contract is initially to recollect that at the time of 
writing, or within the tradition of its writing, the contract is a symbol 
and as such, as a sign of permanence and of writing, it is the form of 
the contract and not its content that requires consideration. The 
contract is a deed or obligation, a formal act or legal bond (iuris 
vinculum), an instrument that will bring speech to writing and so stnd 
it on. The structure of the contract is that of writing itself; writing ~.nd 
law are identical in the form ofralio or lex scripta. The text issues fr')m 
the mouth of its author (Deo auctore), and as written body, as corpuJ or 
oeuvre, as cold and dead prose, it will remain indefinitely as a vestige 
or relic, a mark or trace of an original act. The term contract it:ielf 
implies an identical point: the contract - con·traho - draws together, 
but it is also, in the past tense, an instrumeilt of will since con-lra.:Lus 
literally means contracted, with a treatise or tract, with a trace or 
symbol- I pass on my will, and will delay my death indefinitely. The 
treatise or tract is the sign that survives death and will stand for its 
sender long after his or her demise. What is written is thus vestigial; it 
marks times and reminds us equally that death cannot be objectivt , it 
cannot be final, it will always leave traces or marks of disapperancc. 
The content of the contract replicates its form Contractual words 
must also survive death; they must trace indefinitely the original bond 
of reference, the legality of the sign. The death oflhe subject and the 
death of meaning are both to be counteracted by the: contract, by ~ h .'!
