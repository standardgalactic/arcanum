This book is written for the progressive
salesman ,
advertiser,
sales
correspondent
for every
o ne who is: engaged in inﬂuencing
men to buy .
It
. does not deal with the t ech
nique
of selling ; each form of selling has its
own technique which must be separately
ac
quired .
Rather it
. deals with principles .
It
recognizes that certain elements are common
to all forms of selling .
These elements are
certain occurrences within the mind of the
buyer .
Whether directed by word of mouth ,
by pen or by picture , th e mind must perforce
pass through certain stages on r o ute to the act
of purchase .
It is to describe these mental
processes that the book is written .
Such a work must necessarily deal with
profound p sychological questions .
Such men
tal
processes
as
attention ,
interest ,
desire ,
and conﬁdence require voluminous treatment
in the literature
o f theoretical
psychology .
The author has endeavored in this presenta
tion, however, to
rob them of their forbidding
v

vi
PREFACE
dryness by stripping away technical
terms
and substituting words of current business
usage .
Two outstanding ideals have governed the
preparation of the work
( 1 )
To show the
reader how to take the psychological point of
view toward the business of selling ;
( 2 )
to
teach that in investigating the sale psycho
logically
we
must
employ
the
methods
of
scientiﬁc measurement .
By repetition and ex
ample the author has emphasized these
two
ideals .
If he shall have made them clear he
will have accomplished his chief aim whether
he teaches a great amount
o f psychological
fact or no t .
The
psychologist
-reader
will
discern
a
studied avoidance of the spiritistic conception
of mind .
The mind is here conceived as an
organic
unity .
Though
exposition
of
this
point
of view is withheld , as unseemly in a
book
of this kind, still the phraseology will
be found to ﬁt it, without at the same time
affrighting the non
-psychological reader
un
familiar
with
the
controversies
about
the
mind
-body relation .
This avoidance of meta
physical disputations is further helped by the
consistent
emphasis
upon
the
buyer
’s
be
havior.
Objective
desc riptions
are largely

PREFACE
vii
used .
And since
o ur objective psychological
nomenclature is not cluttered with spiritistic
connotations, the aim of being scientiﬁc and
at the same time understandable is more easily
achieved .

CHAPTER ONE
TH E STREAM
OF
T H OU GH T IN
TH E SALE
Successful selling demands psychological point
of View.
A sale is an interaction between two
people who are exchanging economic
goods .
This interaction consists of a series of changes
occurring in both buyer and
seller .
The lat
e
ter makes certain moves which call forth re ‘
spo nsive movements from the former .
The moves made by the seller may consist
of various things : display
o f
goods ; verbal
descriptions ; pictures ; even the proffer
o f a
fri endly cigar .
The responses
o f the buyer
may be equally variable : entering a store for
a box of candy
displayed
in the
window ;
reaching into the pocket for a coin ; sending
for a catalog ; dispatching a written order .
In the light of such variable conditions we
must recognize as forms of selling :
adver
tising, window display , sales correspondence
and perso nal salesmanship .
Although each
of these modes of
selling
ha s its peculiar
problems and methods , all have one aim in
3

THE MIND
OF THE BUYER
common— to inﬂuence the mind
of the buyer .
Any seller, then, who wishes to be successful
must study th e mind of the buyer—in other
words, must take the psychological point
o f
view .
Th e
mind
a
stream.
In
discussing
the
mind
o f the buyer we
may proﬁtably
use
James
’s ﬁgure
o f
speech
a nd picture it as a
stream , consisting
o f the sum
-total of mental
processes
going
on
within
the
individual
ideas,
sensations, feelings, volitions and
a c
tions .
There are
two characteristics
of the
stream which deserve
special notice
Characteristics
of the mental
stream.
1
.
The mind never stands
still .
It is in
constant motion .
The thoughts of
o ne mo~
ment are quickly replaced by others .
The
mind o f the buyer in a sale consists of a pro
cession
of sensations, feelings, and willings .
From the beginning to the conclusion of the
sale these ﬂow along like a stream .
2 .
The mind is complex .
It is not a simple
thing that we are dealing with , but an organ
ism
of many qualities and powers .
It will
be our
task in
this
book
to
describe
this
stream ;
to slow it up and examine its con
tents .
We shall analyze it in two directions
longi tudinally and cross
-sectionally .
In the

STREAM OF THOUGHT IN SALE
5
ﬁrst case we shall divide it into several rather
well
-deﬁned stages, each of which we shall
study separately .
In the second, we shall cut
cross
-sections at critical points and examine
the contents minutely under our psychological
microscope .
The
stages in
a
sale.
The mental stream of
the buyer may be divided into six stages
Attention
Interest
Desire
Conﬁdence
Decision and Action
Satisfaction

The

and Selling
” )
The
order
just
mentioned
may
not
be
strictly adhered
to in every
sale .
For
in
stance,
conﬁdence
may
precede
desire
and
even interest ; interest may come simultane
o usly
with
attention .
Generally
speaking,

6
TH E M IND
OF
TH E BUYER
however,
the
order
given above will
truly
represent conditions,
especially in the initial
purchase of an article .
W
'
e
should al so recognize th e fact that the
stages are not necessarily equal in length .
The initial pul se of attention may last but a
moment before merging into interest .
Inter
est
. may then endure for an hour .
Moreover
a
single
stage may vary in length under dif
ferent circumstances .
Interest may endure
for a minute , an hour, a day or a year .
Cro ss
- sectional analysis of the stream . Though
we
shall regard
th e mind
a s an ever
-ﬂowing
stream,
still we
shall occa sionally be obliged
to act. as though we could
stop it .
At
im
portant
stages
we
shall retard it and take
cross
- sections of it .
Were we to represent
these diagramatical ly we
should
use a circle
similar to that of Figure 2 , and represent the
sensations, idea s, and feelings of
th e buyer
by
symbolic
designs .
W e
should
bear
in
mind throughout that this procedure is really
an artiﬁcial one .
Strictly
speaking we can
not stop the mind in its ﬂow and make detailed
pictures of its contents .
Nevertheless we shall
employ thi s method
a s far
as possible , being
justiﬁed by the facts thus obtainable and the
clearness of analysis thus made possible .

Other points of View .
In taking
the psycho
logical point of view we do not mean to imply
that the only problems in
selling are those
of a psychological nature .
Particularly
im
portant are those of an ethical and economic
nature .
And
before
proceeding
with
our
F IG . 9 .
Cross
- section
o f
stream of thought .
( R eproduced by kind p ermission
o f J .
B
. Lippincott Company,
from the
autho r
’s
“ Manual
fo r
the
Study
o f the
Psychology
o f Advert i sing
and
psychological descrip tions we should observe
the relations between these several points of
View .
When we regard a sale from the ethical
point of view we stress the ri ghtness or wrong
ness of the transaction .
We
a sk
'
Is this
practice right ?
Are the goods being sold
a t
a fair price ?
Are they being sold with a
consideration for the rights of competitors ?

8
TH E M IND
OF
TH E BUYER
The ethical side of
selling is exceedingly im
portant from the standpoint of the welfare of
society .
And it is gratifying to note that the
standards
of ethics in the business world are
ri sing .
We shall present
some evidence for
this in a later section of the boo k ( page
When we regard a sale from th e economic
point of view we a sksuch questions a s these
What are the sources of the commodity under
consideration ?
What agencies are required
to bring it from source to buyer ?
What are
the separate elements that enter in to
de
termine the price ?
It is needless to enumerate
more questions .
Every business man fo rmu
lates
scores of them daily ; for whether one
neglects other points of view or not,
o ne is
bound to consider the economic point of view .
Important
as are these
two aspects of the
sale we shall
no t stress them in this book .
We shall assume that
no reader will under
take any practice which is not ethically justi
ﬁed .
And we shall assume that the protes
sional
economists
will
take
care
of
the
economic issues involved .
S o we
shall con
centrate o ur attention upon the psychological
aspects .
In undertaking
to psychologize about the
conduct of the buyer, l et it be understood that

and wills ; and he sought to determine whence
it came and where it went after death .
Aristotle
’s kind
of psychology endured for
many hundreds
o f years, in fact, until the
seventeenth century .
About this time Locke ,
Hume and others began to assert :
Though we
have been trying for centuries to discover the
nature , origin and source of the soul , we have
no t succeeded .
Let
us, then, abandon these
questions and relegate them
to the realm
o f
things beyond
o ur ken .
Instead let
us
ob
serve the events that occur duri ng the lifetime
of an individual .
In other words, let
us con
sider the mind onl y
as it relates to man
’s
bodily conduct .
This
advice
was
heeded
and
psychology
came to be deﬁned as the
“ science of mind
”
o r
“ consciousness .
”
This deﬁnition endures
at the present time , colored in
th e popular
mind by relic s of Aristotle
’s mysticism .
Since the middle of th e nineteenth century
another conception of psychology has arisen .
During the nineteenth century the physical
sciences—physic s
and
chemistry— developed
greatly ; and
the biological
sciences—botany ,
zoology, and physiology— arose .
Under the
inﬂuence
of these developments, psychology
began to change in subject
-matter and method .

STREAM OF THOUGHT IN SALE
1 1
( 1 ) The inﬂuence of bodily conditions upon
the mind came to be more clearly recognized ;
and ( 2 ) the methods used in the other rapidly
developing
sciences
were
timidly
applied .
Many of these methods worked, particularly
those used in the investigation
of animal be
havior .
As a result, psychology came
to be
deﬁned as the
“ science
of consciousness
and
behavior .
”
( Some extremists have
gone so
far as to leave o ut the word consciousness and
call it the
“ science o f
This deﬁni
tion, though not vitally objectionable to most
psychologists
of
to
-day, nevertheless carries
some undesirable implications .
Accordingly
we shall adopt a slightly different wording :
“ the science which aims
to describe and ex
plain the conduct of living creatures .
”
After this brief historical
ré sumé the reader
may understand why in the popular mind
psychology
continues
to
be
identiﬁed
with
mystical , abstract , and ethereal things .
He
may also see that the real progress of the
science has been away from mysticism ; that
tod ay it is just as matter
-of fact and
“ earthly
”
as the
sciences
of physics,
geography,
and
astronomy .
This
kinship
with
the
other
sciences will be shown more clearly in
o ur
next paragraph where we shall discuss the

12
TH E M IND OF
TH E BUYER
method
of psychology and show that it is
identical with that employed by other sciences .
S cientiﬁc
method—ex periment .
In
desc ri b
ing and explaining the actions
. of the buyer,
psychology employs the method common
to
all sciences—experiment .
The procedure of
an experi ment may be described as follows
1
.
To
o bser ve the phenomenon under con
sideration .
To
observe
systematically,
not
spasmodically
o r
sporadically .
Indeed, to be
thoroughly scientiﬁc we must make
o ur
ob
servatio ns under carefully controlled condi
tions— usually in the laboratory where we can
control them more easily than in the hurly
burly o f everyday life .
By
“ control
” we mean
to arrange conditions
so that we may repeat
o ur
obser vations
( for in
making
scientiﬁc
measurements we cannot rely upon merely
o ne observation )
watch
o ne factor at a time ;
and change conditions at will .
In brief, an
experiment is
“ a
series
o f observations which
can be repeated, isolated and varied .
”
2 .
We
must
r eco rd
o ur
measures .
We
must
use great care in doing this ; describing
exactly the conditions under which we per
form our experiment,
so that another
ex peri
menter working under
the same conditions
may
secure similar results .
We record our

STREAM OF THOUGHT IN SALE
1 3
results,
be
it
understood,
in
mathematical
terms .
Accordingly a. very important part
of our records will be ﬁgures .
3 .
Our next step is
to
tabulate these ﬁg
ures in orderly array, then to summarize them
in a concise form
so that they may be readily
perceived .
4 .
On the basis of the results secured we
draw
c o nclusio ns .
In
order to illustrate
this procedure we
shall give an experiment which is sometimes
performed in the psychological laboratory :
A PS Y CH OLOGICA L E! PER IM EN T
( Ad apted from
C .
H
.
Judd ,

M anual
o f
P sychology

Co .)
Hold page
1 5 directly in front
o f the
eyes
at
a di stance
o f
about twenty inches .
Though these two lines
a re
equal
le ngth ( 1 0 centimeters :
4 inche s) ,
the horizontal line
ap
pears to
be
sho rter than
the vertical
o ne .
There
is
a
p sychological fact
at
the bottom
o f this :
namely, th at
the
app arent length
o f
a line dep ends to
some degree
upon its
position .
This much
is
evident from c a sual observation .
But to have
a
scientiﬁc
statement of the fact w e mu st
state
how much
e ffect
is
produced by
cha nging
the line from
the horizontal to
the vertical position .
W e must mea sure
the
e ffect
and
state it in mathematical terms.
In order to do this, cover the vertical line with
a
piece
o f plain p ap er,
setting the p age
up in front of the
eyes
at
a dist ance of twenty inches .
Then, using
the horizontal
line as a
stand ard, draw o n
a piece of plain p ap er,
a vertical

1 4

line which
appears to you
to
equal
the horizontal line .
( D o
not try to mak
e
allowance for the discrep ancy which
you
no w know
ex i sts . )
If you measure
the line you have j ust drawn
yo u will
prob ably ﬁnd that it is less th an four inche s ; thus
showing
that you j udged
the line longer wh en in the vertical
posi
tion, than in the ho rizontal .
A nd you
c an
state how much
longer you j udged it by
subtracting
the length of your
Copied line from the length o f the stand ard .
But this single
observ ation is no t
sufﬁcient to p ermit
a
scientiﬁc conclusion.
In scientiﬁc investigation a
single observation is seldom relied
upon.
Y o u must make more measures .
Cover
up
the line
yo u j ust drew
a nd draw
anoth er ; cover it
up
and draw
successive lines,
covering
e ach li ne
as
soon
as drawn, u ntil
you h ave drawn ten .
Now measure
all
the lines
and record
the lengths ;
add
them
a nd
ﬁnd
the
average .
Y our
series
o f measures will
resemble the series below,
showing the lengths
o f lines drawn
by
another
ex perimenter under the se
same conditions .
The
measure s
a re
stated in centimeters .
With
a horizontal line
o f ten centimeters ( four inches)
as
a
standard the vertical
line was drawn ten times with the following lengths
The
average
shows
a di fference
o f
centimeters between the horizontal
standard
and the vertic al
copies.
This gives
us
sound
b asis for concluding that under
the condi
tions of the
experime nt , the
apparent length
of
a line ch a nges from
1 0 centimeters to
centimeters when
the line
is changed
from horizontal to vertical .

Three
forms
o f
scientiﬁc method .
We may
apply the experi mental
( scientiﬁc )
method
to problems of selling in three forms :
1
.
“ Statistical investigation
of returns .
We may arrange conditions in a selling cam
paign
so that the returns may be measured .
By successive trial s of diﬁerent methods and
compari sons between returns, we may deter
mine
which
method
is
the
most
eﬁectiv e .
Good examples of this in the ﬁeld of advertis
ing are furnished by Shryer .
This scientiﬁc
“ investigation
of returns
h owever desirable it may be, is many times
not feasible .
The returns from many sales


1 8
THE MIND OF THE BUYER
legible
headline .
To
investigate
this
we
might enter the psychological laboratory, ex
pose
sample headl ines through
a n instrument
called the tachistoscope ; measure the
speed
with which a number of persons can perceive
the headlines in the two kinds of type ; tabu
late our results ; collate them ; and conclude
which type is the more legible .
Many
ap
plications of this form o f scientiﬁc method are
desc ri bed in the several books
o n the
P sy
chol ogy of Advertising .
We may conﬁdently
afﬁrm that the method has demonstrated its
adaptability
to the solution
of a number of
problems of selling .
With certain problems,
however,
it can hardly be
used effectively,
owing in part to an inevitable
artiﬁciality of
the laboratory atmosphere .
3 .
But we have not exhausted the possi
bilities of scientiﬁc method in the investiga
tion
of problems of
selling .
In case neither
o f the above two methods is adaptable,
o r in
case we wish
to corroborate
o ur ﬁndings by
other kinds
of information, we may secure
light from still another direction .
Our aim ,
be it remembered, is to discover with scientiﬁc
accuracy the most effective way to do
a thing
before we proceed to do it .
If we cannot
ac
complish this in the market
o r in the labora

STREAM OF THOU GHT IN SALE
1 9
tory,
we may appeal
to
the experience
of
other sellers
who have faced
o ur problem ;
and
by
observing
their solutions,
we
may
govern our procedure .
H ow discover their experiences ?
To ask
them would evoke contradictions and opinions
of different. degrees of reliability .
Further
more,
since we
seek scientiﬁc
formulations
of
o ur facts we must have ﬁgures instead of
opinions .
How shall we reduce the
ex peri
ences of sellers to numerical terms ?
The answer is, Use the
“ historical method .
Investigate the practices of the sellers of the
past
and observe
the ways in which
they
solved the problems that confront us .
F o r example, in answering
“ historically
the question propounded above :
Is it in gen
eral
more
proﬁtable
to
use
upper
-case
or
lower
-case type in headlines ?
, one would
go
to the ﬁles
o f newspapers and magazines for
many years back , and ascertain the percentage
of headlines in small letters .
An investigation
of this nature by the author disclosed the
fact that advertisers have been using with
increasing
frequency
lower
-case
headlines .
Whereas in
1 905 sixty
-three per cent
of the
headlines in full
-page advertisements in the
Litera ry D igest were in lower
-case type, in

20
THE MIND OF
TH E BUYER
1 920 the number had increased to seventy
-six
per cent .

of
the

method :

Showing
the
increase
in
the
use of lower-case
type for headlines between 1 905
and 1 920
.
They
formed
a
coo perative
bureau
which
examined the practices of all the ﬁrms ; tabu
lated them and combined the resul ts, embody
ing them into
a system by which all might
select their salesmen .
In employing
the
“historical
”
method we
make use of several assumptions

STREAM OF THOUGHT IN SALE
21
a .
The practices which have persisted over
a period of years have probably been of value .
We infer either that
. those ﬁrms which did
not follow these practices did not make enough
money to enable them to continue
to
adver
tise ;
or that
those
which
did
continue
to
advertise, discovered the difference between
valueless and valuable practices and adopted
the latter.
We must not assume that sellers made these
changes as a result
o f conscious discoveries .
They worked mainly by tri al and error .
As
indicated in Figure
4 ,
they discovered
the
usefulness o f lower
-case type in headlines only
after a long
-extended period of experi menta
tion .
We may regard modern selling practices,
then,
as products of unconscious evolution .
In the struggle for existence in the world
of
publicity, certain features have survived be
cause
o f certain
psychological
elements
of
strength and ﬁtness .
They exemplify a sort
of economic
“ survival of the ﬁttest .
”
b .
A
second
assumption
we
make
in
utilizing the
“ historical
”
method is that if
seller
's had studied the practices of their pre
decessor
-s they might have avoided some errors
and might h ave
eliminated much
wastage .

22
THE MIND OF THE BUYER
And we assume that by surveying the prae
tices of the past and by discovering which ones
have survived and which have failed, we may
modify our practices and ﬁnd a shorter and

We repeat that we are
not proposing the
historical method as a formula fo r the solu
tion
of all selling problems .
We advocate it
merely as
o ne form
o f scientiﬁc investigation
which will permit us to supplement and
co r
roborate information secured by other means .
Indeed we cannot regard either one of these
methods as sufﬁcient for the approach to sell
ing problems .
At best each throws only a bit
of
light
upon
the
entire
situation .
One
method may be better adapted to one type of
problem than is another meth od .
And one
may be more adaptable to o ne type of problem
than to another type .
In most cases probably
two
o r all three of the methods will be found
useful ; each one supplementing the results
secured through the others .
After this discussion
of
the history and
methods of psychology,
the reader will see
that modern psychology has no hint of hocus
pocus in its procedure ; that it is far from
being the mesmeric game

A TTENTION


CHAPTER TWO
IM PORTANT FA CTORS IN ATTRACTING ATTENTION
Th e nature
of
attention .
In the preceding
chapter we likened the mind of the buyer to
a
stream
constantly in motion
and highly
complicate d .
We formulated
o ur purpose : to
describe and explain the stream in its ﬂow .
The method : to cut cross
-sections at various
important stages and to analyze them under
our psychological microscope .
The ﬁrst sta ge that we shall analyze is
at
tention .
To secure the attention of the buyer
is the seller
’s ﬁrst task .
It is often fraught
with
difﬁculty .
F o r
the
buyer
’s
mental
stream is ﬂowing along placidly, charged with
thoughts relating to his personal affairs .
The
seller,
who
brings
forward
a.
new
article ,
foreign,
perhaps,
to
these affairs, is bound
to encounter some difﬁculty in thrusting it
into the stream .
His task is more difﬁcult
from the fact that he must place his
com
modity not merely at the edge
of the stream
where it may remain practically
unnoticed .
29

30
TH E M IND OF THE BUYER
He must thrust it, as it were, completely into
the middle
o f the
stream .
Only thus can he
secure for it a high degree of attention .
The ease with which the seller may do this
depends partly upon the rate of ﬂow
of the
stream and partly upon the contents of it .
Sometimes the current ﬂows sluggi shly,
as
when the buyer
sits without occupation in a
street
-car and casts his eyes carelessly from
one advertising card to another .
On such
oc
casions it is easy for the seller to enter the
stream .
At other times the mind ﬂows with to rren
tial vehemence ,
a s when the buyer is
co nsum
mating a deal
o n the ﬂoor of the stock ex
change
o r watching an exciting ball
game .
Under such circumstances it is
difﬁcult to
inject a new object into the center o f attention .
Further difficulty is encountered if the
c o n
tents of th e mind are quite foreign to the com
modity
under
consideration .
Under
such
circumstances the seller is obliged to prepare
the
mind
beforehand— an
operation
about
which we shall talk in detail in later chapters .
Whatever the difﬁculties may be, the seller
must make a start by attracting the atten
tion .
Hence we shall consider
some devices
by means of which to claim it .
No
single rule

A TTR A CTIN G ATTENTION
31
can be laid down applicable to all rates of
ﬂow
all commodities and all sales mediums .
Nevertheless there are certain factors which
are usually effective .
Intensity
.
The ﬁrst is intensity .
( By
in
tense we mean
“ strong .
”
Normally the mind
is very sensitive
to
strong stimuli : bright
lights, loud noises, strong odors, severe pres
sures, extreme temperatures, intense pains .
We shall more clearly understand the force
inherent in intensity if we inquire its origin
a nd
ra tio na le.
When we consider man his
to rically we must regard him as the inheritor
of various traits from past generations .
F o r
many generations his forbears have been sub
j ected
to
certain
environmental
conditions .
To those that jeopardized their welfare they
gave quick attention : for example, to bright
lights which might put out the eyes ; to loud
sounds which might split the ear
-drums .
The
individuals who failed to take notice of such
things were injured or killed .
Since to attend
to intense things has tended to prolong life,
then , the habit has become ingrained within
the members of the human species as an in
eradicable trait .
Many other traits of the buyer may be thus
accounted for on an hereditary basis .
We

32
TH E M IND OF THE BUYER
shall devote an entire chapter to them at a
later stage .
For the present we shall pass
them by, merely noting the excellent reason
why certain kinds
o f objects readily attract
the attention .
This
gives us a hint as
to
the method of
arresting and penetrating the mental stream
o f the buyer
:
Choose a
stimulus stronger
than the other objects round about him .
In
olden times the town crier used a bell ; the ﬁsh
monger, a horn .
Tod ay the advertiser uses
shrieking bill boards .
The salesman who de
pends upon personal contact rarely uses in
tensity
in
attracting
the
attention
of
his
prospective customer ; probably because of its
frequent rudeness and vulgarity .
If he can
devise
some
elegant
and
inoffensive
way,
however, of utilizing it, he will highly aug
ment his chances
o f securi ng favorable atten
tion .
Ex tensity
.
The second factor is extensity,
by which we mean size, bigness, magnitude .
The mind is very susceptible to the inﬂuence
of bigness .
In its rapid ﬂow it may neglect
the
small objects
seeking shelter in its midst ,
and shove them unheedingly to one side .
B ut
it can hardly do
so to the big ones .
An auto
ist bowling along a country road can scarcely


34
THE MIND OF THE BUYER
by
one who wishes
to inﬂuence the human
mind .
Probably we should regard it
as ex
pl ainabl e by the same principle we used in
explaining man
’s afﬁnity for intensity : as a
racial habit ( perhaps instinct) wrought dur
ing the struggle for existence, when man wa s
obliged to take notice of things larger than
himself in order to escape being overcome by
them .
Whatever be its explanation it offers a live
cue to the seller, and suggests that he may in
crease his chances
o f success by operating on
a
large
scale .
The
practice
of
successful
sellers exempliﬁes this .
“ Probably
no man
in the world has more unqualiﬁed belief in
the power of ! big! advertising than William
Wrigley,
Jr .
In the twelve years since his
ﬁrst great national campaign he
has spent
more than
to
spread his message
in
eighteen
languages
across
the
civilized
world .
”
“As a result of one of his huge
co n
tracts each of the
street,
subway and
elevated cars in operation in the United States
carries
one
or more
of
his
cards .
Above
Times Square, New York, ﬂashes nightly an

He
duplicated
this
campaign
in
1 9 1 9 , this time to more than
homes .
His advertising expenditures for the one year
pass the
mark .
”
1
The tremendous
growth of adverti sing in general during the
past twenty
-ﬁve years bears
similar evidence
of the attractive power of magnitude in the
form
of increasing use
of
ex tensIve
space .

Change.
Our
third
proposition
is
that
change has great value in arresting attention
change in any sense : in intensity, extensity,
or nature of stimulus .
We may test the truth
o f this in everyday life by noting that we are
aware that
th e clock has been ticking, only
after it has stopped .
M ovement . One very common form of change
is
movement .
To
it
we
give
certain
and
eager response .
Though for the most part
unaware of it, we shall ﬁnd, when we stop to
think, that it bulks importantly in
o ur daily
life .
We sit for hours by the ocean , gazing
at
nothing
but

waves ; we lie on the ground absorbed in the
clouds that ﬂoat across our vision ; we
sit be
fore an open ﬁre fascinated by the ever
-dart
ing ﬂames, almost
to the point
o f hypno tiza
tion .
How explain
this fascination ?
Probably
largely in terms of inheri tance ,
a s we did our
afﬁnity for intensity and extensity .
In the
distant days when man
’s progenitor stalked
in
the jungles,
o ne
of the most important
factors in life was movement .
The lightest
ﬂutter of a leaf might indicate the presence
of a hidden enemy ; the ﬂicker of a twig might
signify lurking death . As a result our ancestor
was obliged
to give close attention to any
thing that moved .
If he had failed he would
have fallen victim one day to the destructive
forces surrounding him .
As a result the
off
spri ng of pri mitive man manifested intense
interest in moving things .
The trait , being
useful in preserving life,
became ingrained
within the members
of the
species and per
sists to this day .
There is another way of accounting fo r the
inﬂuence of movement .
It ﬁts into the very
nature
of
mentality .
The mind
is
like
a
stream , constantly in motion .
A moving
oh
j cet, then,
has a ready chance
of securing a

ATTRACTING ATTENTION
37
foo thold in the stream .
The relationship may
be pictured by imagining two platforms,
o ne
( the mind ) moving, and the other ( the object
o f attention )
stationary .
To step from the
latter
to
the
former
requires
considerable
effort .
If, however, we start the second in
motion in the same direction and at the same
rate as the ﬁrst , we can make the transition
easily .
It is thus that a moving object ﬁts
into the nature of the onward
-ﬂowing mental
processes .
In addition to this onward ﬂow of the total
stream there is a form of movement within
the stream itself .
Eddies are present, which
keep the contents of the stream oscillating
to and fro .
The mind is
so constituted that
it cannot hold an object in the center for
longer than an instant .
The reader may test
this
for
himself
by
attempting
to
ﬁx ate
steadily the letter
0.
Though he may
try
his best to maintain it unchanged in the center
o f his attention , he will ﬁnd that he cannot .
His attention will wander from one part of
the letter to another, from top to bottom, from
side to side ; and presently,
off the letter
em
tirely to a nearby ﬂaw in the paper .
In
ﬁxing
the limits
to
the
time
during
which one can hold an object in attention

38
TH E MIND OF THE BUYER
in a perfectly unchanged condition, psych ol o
gists have discovered some evidence that the
period may be two or three minutes, but far
more commonl y,
only a
second
or
two
in
length .
After this length of time in the vortex
of the stream an object must give way to
a n
other
o ne which has been hovering on
the
F IG . 5 .
margin waiting fo r a chance to wedge itself
in .
Be it remembered that at any one mo~
ment there are many things variously
dis
tributed in the mental stream .
A cross
-sec
tion would reveal a condition resembling that
pictured in Figure 5, where object A (let it
be a street
-car advertisement of Bunte Cough
Drops )
gives way after a brief dominance
over the center of attention , to object B ( an
adjoining advertisement
of Arrow collars) ;

ATTRACTING ATTENTION
39
which in its turn gives way to object C ( an
advertisement of Sloan
’s liniment )
.
Again, such a cross
-section might be likened
to a kaleidoscope in which minute pieces of
varicolored glass continually shift their posi
tions .
That which was at the center drifts
marginwa rd and vice versa .
From this we see that movement is a capital
device for the seller to use, not merely in in
troducing his commodity into the center
of
the mental
stream,
but
also in holding it
there .
N ow we
see ,
at least in part,
the
mechanism
by
which
we
give
attention
so
spontaneously
to
selling devices which
em
body movement : the army of manikins in store
windows feverishly plying
safety
-razors ; the
display shoes aridly stepping in and out of
pans of water .
The moving electri c
Sign offers excellent
opportunity for the exploitation of movement .
It is demonstrably effective .
The reader may
test himself to
-night as he walks down Main
street .
Let him watch himself
o ut of the
corner of his eye , so to speak ; and he will ﬁnd
himself observing the moving signs alm o st
invariably .
He will be aware of them far to
the right and left ; even of those in the rear,
ﬂickering in his eye
-glasses .
He will notice,

40
THE M IND OF THE BUYER
also , that a faint moving light attracts atten
tion more quickly than a
strong stationary
o ne .
A ﬁeld with still greater possibilities
o f de
vel opment is the moving picture .
Here is
movement
incarnate ,
the
consummation
o f
man
’s age
-long dream s and cravings . And man
worships at their shrine nightly, be he rich
o r poor, young o r old, savant or imbecile .
He
tries
to justify his infatuation by elaborate
reasons
o f an
esthetic ,
social
o r economic
nature : the cinema offers a varied entertain
ment ; is always just around the corner ; costs
only about a quarter .
But these do not fully
account for his interest .
For when the plot
is vapo ri sh , the humor inane , the vamping
“ ol d stuff,
” he still attends with seemingly in
satiable
avidity .
The
cinema
as
a
selling
medium has no t yet come into its own .
Never
thel ess it will
undoubtedly
develop into
a
valuable ally
fo r the seller, because it em
bodies a feature to which man is passionately
inclined—movement .
Simulated or suggested mov ement .
S o
strong
is our afﬁnity for movement that we respond
to the mere suggestion

variety .
In background, type and illustration ,
one may achieve , thanks to the inventions
of
modern printing, a number of striking eﬁects .
These varieties, numerous as they are, con
stitute only a fraction of the number possible
in the realm of color .
And effective as are the
former, they pale beside the latter .
Several lines of proof point to the overp ow
ering attractiveness of color .
F o r
o ne, we
need go no further than everyday observation .
When the early settlers

to make an attractive price to the Indians did

beads .
It is said that the mail
order houses have found colored catalogs
to
be very superior to those in black and white .
More scientiﬁc proof from the laboratories is
reported in the voluminous literature upon
the subject .
If our curiosity leads us
to inquire why
color attracts the attention
so
much
more
easily than grayness, we may ﬁnd a partial
explanation in the fact that the light waves
fo r colors travel farther than
do those for
grayness .
Whatever be the reason, we may
conﬁdently employ color whenever possible .

A TTR A CTIN G ATTENTION

Other
effects
of
color .
Before
concluding
this
inadequate
treatment
of
the
subject
we should point
o ut that color may be useful
not onl y in attracting attention .
It may al so
hold attention .
Again it may arouse pl easur
able feelings .
The feelings may come from
intrinsic pleasure
-giving quality of the color ;
then may be transferred to the object being
sold— an end evidently sought in the coloring
of the containers of certain brands of face pow
der . Or it may give pleasure by reason
o f cer
tain ideas it arouses within the buyer .
In seek
ing to use color we face a large group of ques
tions relating to the appropriateness of color
to commodity . We shall merely recognize the
existence of these for the present, reserving
their detailed consideration for a later chapter .
Summary
.
In discussing these four factors
intensity, extensity, change and color, we have
no t exhausted the list of determinants of
at
tention which are available to the seller .
We
have merely touched upon four which ﬁt into
the outline of this book .
Another in particu
lar—repetition— is so important that we shall
use it as the basis of
o ur next chapter .

CHAPTER THREE
TH E INFLU ENCE
OF
REPETITION
R epetition wins attention .
If we cannot force
o ur commodity into the center
o f attention
by any of the devices mentioned in the pre
ceding chapter,
o r by virtue of its intrinsic
merit and appropriateness to the contents of
the buyer
’s mind, we may have recourse
to
another factor— repetition .
Mere bald, brutal
repetition goes far in attracting attention .
This fact is crystallized in the old proverb
“ Constant dropping wears away
stones .
”
We have frequent veriﬁcation of this fact
in everyday life .
Often when we are asleep
a sound occurs without awaking us the ﬁrst
time ,
the second or the third .
As it per
sistently recurs , however, it forces
its way
through
the
murk
o f unconsciousness
and
arouses us . And then as we look back we recall
that the sound had been there vaguely ( in the
ma rgIn of the mental
stream )
fo r some time,
but had required repetition to be effective .
For an explanation of the great power resi
44

THE INFLUENCE OF REPETITION
45
dent in repetition, we are driven to a con
sideration of the brain and nervous system .
In order for a thing to affect the mind it must
enter the pathways to the brain .
These path
ways are somewhat resistant to new impres
sions, but after repeated assault they open
up and permit access to the brain .
Another form of explanation is the assertion
by
some psychologists that man is innately
credulous,
that he is inclined
to
accept
.
as
true every statement he hears .
In the course
of experience, however, the adult person de
vel op s inhibitions, which make him
sophisti
cated and resistant .
To
overcome this
re
sistance requires considerable battering .
To
this factor is due the effectiveness of many
sales
-names, like Uneeda .
Though the buyer
may resist the repetitions
o f this name fo r a
time, he eventually comes to believe that he
does need
a biscuit, and makes the purchase .
It is this coercive power o f repetition which
justiﬁes the
so
-called display advertising con
stituting so great a part of modern publicity .
Many a ﬁrm advertises on bill
-boards, theater
programs, and the like , when it knows it can
not eﬁect an immediate sale .
But by keeping
its name and commodity before the mind
of
the public , it hopes
to derive a cumul ative

46
TH E MIND
OF
TH E BUYER
eﬁect that will ultimately bring about action .
During the World W a r many ﬁrms which had
already sold their entire output to the govern
ment continued none the less to use a great
amount of advertising space, hoping by repeti
tion to retain a place in the mind o f the public .
And their course of action was justiﬁed by
this psychological principle we are now
co n
sidering
.
R epetition inﬂuences memory
.
This leads us
to recognize that repetition does more than
merely force the merits of a commodity upon
the attention of the buyer .
It imprints the
message deeply within
his memory .
For as
a rule the seller desires not merely to put his
message into the buyer
’s mind , but to keep it
there that it may instigate purchase time after
time .
Repetition , then , is a powerful agent
with which
to overcome
th e well
-known for
getful ness
of the human race which would
naturally tend to relegate a commodity to the
margin of the mental stream .

‘
Distribution
of repetitions. We may vary the
effectiveness
of our repetitions by the way
in which we distribute them over a period of
time .
By repeating our message at certain
intervals, we may increase the retentiveness
of the buyer
’s mind .

THE INFLUENCE OF REPETITION
47
The matter may be explained by imagining
a case where we are announcing a new article
in a monthly magazine .
Let us assume that
we have decided upon eight insertions fo r the
year .
How
shall
we
most
effectively
dis
tribute them ?
A number
of alternatives are
possible ; eight consecutive insertions in the
ﬁrst eight, last eight, or any eight successive
issues ; four in the ﬁrst four issues of the
year, four in the last four, and so on .
Though
we cannot say
fo r certain what is the best
distribution for every
Speciﬁc article, still we
may make some proﬁtable guess by considera
tion of certain facts proven by laboratory
demonstration
After much investigation of memory,
psy
chol ogists have discovered that facts once im
pressed upon the mind tend
to slip away
at
an uneven rate— rapidly at ﬁrst, then more
and more slowly until the amount retained
reaches a constant level and stays there .
The
matter is graphically represented by a curve
of forgetting,
similar to that of Figure
6,
where the greater part of the material is for
gotten almost immediately and a smaller part
remains relatively constant ( as shown by the
line AB )
.

48
TH E M IND OF THE BUYER
It is
not inconceivable that this condition
holds good fo r the memory
of things seen in
advertisements .
If so let
us speculate upon
the proﬁtable ways
o f distri buting repeated
advertisements .
The author h a s ventured to
lay
o ut
a reasonable distribution upon the
curve in Figure

Since the

importance, without being itself conscious of
the process,
until
its

selves to consciousness, in the new ideas,
o r
new combinations of ideas, which the process?
has evolved .
”
An instance related by Coleridge illustrates
this strikingly :
A c ase of this kind occurred in
a R oman Catholic town
in Germany
a year or two b efore my
arrival
at GOttingen,
a nd had
no t then

a frequent

A young woman of four or
ﬁve
and twenty,
who could
neither read
no r write, was
seized with
a
nervous
fever ; during which ,
a ccording to
the
asseverations of
all
the
priests
a nd
monks of
the
neighborhood,
she became
possessed,
and ,
as it
appe ared , by
a very learned devil .
She
continued incessantly talking Latin,
Greek
,
a nd H ebrew,
in very pompous tones
and with most distinct
enunciation.
This possession w as rendered more
probable by the known
fact that
she was or had been
a heretic .
Voltaire humor

advises
the devil to decline
all
acqu aintance with
medical men;
and it would h ave be en more to his reputation,
if
he had t aken this
advice in the

had
attracted
the

attention
o f
a young
physician,
a nd by his

and cross-examined

young woman ever b een a
simple, h armless creature ; but she
was
evidently laboring under
a
nervous fever .
In the town,
in which
she had been resident for many years
as a
servant
in different families, no solution presented itself.
The young
physician, however, determined to retrace her p ast life
step
by
step ; for the p atient herself was incap able
o f returning
a rational
answer.
H e
at length
succeeded
in discovering
the
place where
her
p arents
had lived ; travelled thither,
found them dead, but
an uncle
surviving ;
and from him
learned, that the patient had been charitably taken by
an
old Protestant p astor
at
nine years old,
and had remained
with him some ye ars,
even till the old man
’s death .
Of this
pastor the uncle knew nothing, but that he was
a very good
man.
With great difﬁculty,
and
after much
search,
our
young medical philosopher discovered
a niece of the p astor
’s,
who
had lived with
him
a s his housekeeper,
and
had
ih
herited his
effects.
She remembered the girl ; related, that
her venerable uncle had been too indulgent,
and could
not
be ar to have the girl
scolded ; that
she was willing to h ave
k
ept her, but that,
after her p atron
’s death the girl herself
refused to
stay.
A nxious inquiries were then, of course,
made concerning the p astor
’s habits ;
and the
solution o f the
phenomenon was soon obtained .
For it appeared, that it had
been the old man
’s custom, for years, to walk up
and down
a p assage of his house into which the kitchen door opened,
and to read to himself with
a loud voice, o ut
o f his favorite
book
s .
A considerable
number of these were
still
in
the
niece
’s possession.
She
added, that he was
a very learned
man
and
a great Hebraist .
A mong the book
s were found
a collection o f R abbinical writings, together with
several
o f
the Greekand Latin Father s ;
and the physician succeeded
in identifying
so many p assages with those t aken down
at
the young woman
’s bedside, that no doubt could remain in
any rational mind concerning
the true origin of
the
im
pressions made
on her
nervous
system.

THE M IND OF
TH E BUYER
This case shows in extreme form what may
happen in lesser degree
to any buyer .
An
advertising appeal to which he pays little
at
tention at the time , may, if repeated often
enough , leave an impression which will at some
later time inﬂuence him to buy .
The reader
may test his own memory in this respect in the
following paragraph :
What trade names ﬁrst come into your mind
in connection with these commodities :
Lini
ment,
gum ,
cough
drops,
camera ,
watch
garter, rooﬁng, paint
talcum powder ?
In connection with each
of these
commo di
ties it is probable that a certain name arose
insta ntly—that
.
o ne which appears most fre
quently on
ca r
-cards, bill
-boards, newspapers
and magazines .
It is likely that if the reader
were buying the article fo r the ﬁrst time, he
would buy this certain kind .
Though in his
daily life
he probably
h ad not paid much
attention
to these ﬂaring signs, still he was
impressed
“ subconsciously ,
”
as it were, and
when he came
to buy, he would act accord
ingly
.
This fact is justiﬁcation for the liberal
use of
“ display
” advertising .
Repetition affects the sale in other ways
than through attention and memory .
It may
inﬂuence later stages
of conﬁdence and de

cisio n.
We shall
no t pause here to discuss
these, however, preferring to plumb the stage
of interest before passing
o n
t o
the later
stages of the
sale .

CHAPTER FOUR
SELLING TO
TH E COLLECTIVE
B U Y ER
D eﬁnition
of
“
public .
”
A good deal
of the
selling of to day is done to people
en ma sse.
A
ca r
-card strikes
not merely
one person at
a time, but a carful .
A newspaper advertise
ment fall s under the eyes no t of o ne individual
but
o f a group .
The persons who are served
by any selling medium constitute a collectivity
—Ross calls it a
“ public
”— which we may de
ﬁne as
a group
of dispersed individuals hav
ing similar ideas, feelings and actions, intensi
ﬁed by the consciousness
of their
“collective
ness .
It should be noted that a public is
no t a
simple arithmetical summation of individual
minds .
N o r is it a new super
-mind transcend
ing its components .
It can be regarded as o ne
mind
‘onl y in the sense that the individual
minds composing it are almost identical in
certain respects .
Then, because each member
of the group knows that
all the other mem
bers hold opinions identical with his, he feels
54

SELLING TO COLLECTIVE BUYER
55
more strongly than he would without such
social support .
- It is in
such a sense , then ,
that we speak of a collective mind as different
from the individual minds composing it .
Newspapers and magazines offer good
in
ternal evidence of the existence of the col
l ective mind .
The editor writes in the plural
number, implying that he is spokesman or
chairman
o f the group .
He emphasizes this
relationship by using such prases as,
“ Editor
’s
Easy
Chair,
”
“ The
Editor
’s
Drawer
” ;
by
heading
his
feature
sections
:
“ Friend
of
the People ,
”
“ Column for Workers,
”
“ Our
Boys and Girls
” ; implying that he is seated
in the midst of his readers , all
of whom
co n
stitute a psychical family .
We may assert , then , that psychologically
speaking, the readers of
a sales medium con
stitute an entity, a public , which is not a loo se
aggregation of isolated and individual minds
but an organic union , coalesced into one col
l ective mind in the sense just mentioned .
Each public unique.
There is further compli
cation in the fact that each public is unique .
The
Chicag o
A merica n public , for example,
differs from that
of the E vening P o st .
The
readers of the Co untry Gentleman differ from
the readers of the F ir eside Comp anion.

56
THE M IND OF THE BUYER
We do
no t disregard the fact that an in
dividual may belong to more than
o ne public .
He may at the same time be a reader
of the
New
York
Times,
the
N ew
R epublic,
the
Congr ega tiona list,
and the
Commercia l
and
F inancia l
Chronicl e;
in
which
fact
is
in
volved
no anomaly
o r mysterious splitting of
personality .
It means
simply that when one
reads the Times he is entertaining ideas that
are being shared with a certain number
of
other people ; and when he reads
the
Co n
gr ega tion alist he is entertaining mental
ten
ants
identical with
those
in
the
minds
of
another group of people .
Sales and advertising
-managers frequently
complain about the multiplicity of mediums
which they mus t use in carrying their mes
sage to the buying public .
They regard it as
a misfortune .
As a matter of fact, such multi
plicity is an advantage ; it simpliﬁes the task
of the advertiser .
There is
not simply
o ne
inﬁnitely large
“buying public,
”
out
of which
a seller may win a few customers .
There are
many
“buying
publics .
”
Not
all
of them
care fo r every commodity, or every type of
a certain commodity .
Fortunately they
a re
sifted
o ut and are grouped, with
reference
to
tastes,
about
certain
periodicals.

3 .
Sociological .
What is the so cial level
o f the public ?
What are the leading occupa
tions represented ; the
sports and relaxations ?
These data are difficult to gather and often
can be ascertained only indirectly .
The chief
difﬁculty comes in expressing them in numeri
cal terms .
One periodical overcame this in
genio usly by collecting telephone directorie‘s
of the country and ascertaining what. per
centage of its subscribers
’ names appeared
therein .
This did not furnish a complete de
scription of the
social status of its public , but
it gave an indication .
These examples indicate that sellers
are
aware of the differences existing between pub
lies and are seeking to measure them seien
tiﬁcally
.
Successful
as they
are ,
however,
they have omitted one important form of in
vestigatio n, which we shall call
4 .
Psychological .
Some of the
greatest
differences
between
publics
are
mental
ideas, feelings, motives, and the like .
People
vaguely recognize these differences ; they
say
that the !
Monthly is read by
“ high
-brows
”

SELLING TO COLLECTIVE BUYER
59
the
Y
Monthly
by
“low

that o ne
newspaper controls
. the
“labor
” vote ; another,
the
“ wet
” element .
If these differences exist
surely we ought to be able to measure them .
True , the ta sk will be difﬁcult ; for psychical
things are obscure and elusive .
Furthermore,
the status of psychology as an accurate science
is so recently established that we do not yet
have psychologi cal
“yard
-sticks
”
with which
to measure all kinds of mental things .
In the effort to secure such measurements
the
author
undertook
an
investigation
of
several periodicals , and discovered a technique
which revealed distinct psychological differ
ences and permitted their mathematical pre
sentatio n .
Though these differences are not
of a nature to be markedly signiﬁcant for
ad
vertising and selling,
they are nevertheless
striking enough to encourage
us to hope that
we may ultimately develop methods that will
be practically applicable to the two
-fold prob
lem which the advertiser faces : what medium
to use , and how adapt copy to each one ?
By way of preliminary approach the follow
ing simple procedure was planned and exe
cuted :
Two periodicals were chosen which
are commonly alleged to serve different pub
o
lies —the
Chicago
Evening
P o st
and
the

60
TH E M IND OF THE BUYER
Chicago A merican .
From the editorial , news
and feature columns of six parallel issues
o f
these
two papers,
approximately
ﬁve
thou
sand words were taken in consecutive order
—an equal number from each newspaper— and
tabulated according to the number of syllables
they contained .
The results are shown in Table I, in terms
of the percentage
o f words containing more
than two, three, etc . , syllables .
These ﬁgures
Show that the number of words over two sylla
bles long in the P o st is greater than that in
the A meric an by seventy per cent ; this ratio
holds fo r all the polysyllabic words .

In order to see if such a test would reveal
similar
diﬁe rences
between
two
magazines,
the
Century and
A merica n magazines were
likewise
examined .
Results,
as
shown
in
Table I, answer
ou r inquiry positively .
They
show
that
the number
of words
over
two
syllables in length in the Century is greater
than the corresponding number in the A meri
can magazine by thirty
-six per cent ; the num
ber over three syllables by ﬁfty
-nine per cent
the number over four syllables by sixty
-seven
per cent ; and the number over ﬁve syllables
by 1 00per cent .
In
continuation
of the
search
for intel
lectual differences,
the length
of sentences
was next measured .
From parallel issues and
columns of the same four periodicals
( o ne
issue each of the newspapers and two each of
the magazines ) a total
of 8000 sentences were
taken in consecutive order .
The number of
words in each sentence was computed and
recorded by tens .
That is, sentences contain
ing from
o ne to ten words were grouped to
gether, those from ten
to twenty, twenty
to
thirty,
and
so
forth .
The percentages are
shown in Table II .
These
results
show
a
greater number of

The author does no t reason from these ﬁnd
ings that a superiority in number of long
words and sentences proves conclusively a cor
responding intellectual
superiority .
Clearly
long words and long
sentences are not an
absolute criterion of erudition or short ones
of ignorance
Nevertheless, we must admit
that in the long run,
the chances favor a
greater
number of long
words
being
a sso
ciated with more enlightened people .
Meas
urements made by various vocabulary tests
have
shown that there are mo r e words in the
vocabularies of the more enlightened ; hence
we might expect a
greater number of
lo ng
words there .
If we should grant the validity of
such as
sumptio ns,
however,
we
still
should recog
nize that the kind
o f meas ures we have just
made are still very fragmentary .
The
psy
chol ogical differences between periodical s, and
especially those differences that interest the
advertiser, are much broader .
P articularly
important are those of an emotional order,
such
as tastes, interests, and the like .
Such
differences
might
conceivably
be
shown as follows :
In each periodical being
investigated,
measure the amount. of space
devoted to each kind
of reading matter ( ex

64
THE MIND OF THE BUYER
cluding advertisements )
. Classify the contents
under such headings as Politics, Finance, R e
l igio n,
Literary
Criticism ,
Science ,
Sports,
etc .
Then chart the results
so as to
show the
proportionate amounts of
space devoted
to
material
of each class .
Such
a study
of
two
magazines
( pooled
measures of four issues each , same months)
gave results
as
shown in Table III .
By thus
statistically studying various periodicals the
seller may prepare a table
( see Table IV )
showing the amount of space in each periodical
devoted to the
subject nearest to his partien
lar commodity ; and from it may infer the
degree of interest held by a public toward each
ﬁeld .
For surely, in the l ong
run, there is a
close relation between the tastes of the readers
of a periodical and the amount
o f space de
voted to various topics .
The amount of
space devoted to advertise
ments of vari ous kinds of commodity might
next be statistically examined .
And the seller,
using our historical
criterion
set forth
o n
page 21 , might settle on those mediums that
devote a certain per cent of space
to mate
ri als relating directly to his commodity .
F o r

they

iVith additional labor and collaboration
b e
tween psychological laboratory and advertis
ing copy
-room , we may hope to develop a kind
of measurement which may ultimately be of
great
service to the advertiser .
A dapt
copy
t o medium.
After having de
cided what medium s
to
use,
the advertiser
who
is
alive
to
the
psychological
factors
involved
in
selling
to
group
buyers,
will
devise for each medium a piece of copy which
will
be
appropriate
to
the
p sychological
characteristics of the public that reads it .
A
good example of
such adaptation which was
successfully made even if it could not be based
upon scientiﬁc
diﬁerentiatio n between pub
lies, is reported by Mr. Frank Fehlman who ,
as sales manager o f H . TV . Gossard Company,
planned an advertising campaign involving
the use of eleven national woman
’s magazines .
He was convinced that each of these periodi
cals served a typical
group of women, and
that his copy should be adapted
to the per
so nality
o f
each
of
these
types .
Lacking
mathematical characterization of these types,
he
sought the editor of each magazine and
asked for
a description
o f the typical reader,
as he, the editor, visualized her.
The
adver

SELLING TO COLLECTIVE BUYER
67
tising copy writer then composed a different
piece of copy for th e top half of each
adver
tisement,
tied up with
the editorial
policy
o f the magazine .
F o r example,
the policy of
Go od
H o use
keeping
had been
closely
knit
around
Dr .
Wiley and food tests .
The magazine guaran
teed its advertisements ; hence the idea
of
guarantee was well grounded in the mind
o f
the reader of the magazine .
Accordingly the
headline over a picture of a galaxy of moving
picture
beauties
garbed
in
the
Gossa rd
product
was,
“ Tested
and
Proved
by
the
Greatest
S tars in the Film World .
Woma n
’s H ome Comp a nio n had been con
ducting a campaign for better ﬁlms .
In order
to ﬁt in with this policy the following headline
wa s
employed
with
the
picture
“ Better

”
“ Then we wrapped our full page in Vog ue
in the smart, aristocratic ,

air e atmos
phere of the lady
o f the limousine who pays

so
vitally toward the regality of her ﬁgure as she

”
After citing other adaptations
of copy
to
medium this writer concludes :
“ We are now
so th oroughly convinced of the necessity
of
linking up copy with the editorial tone of the
magazine that it is o ne of o ur strongest adver
tising policies .
”
If such proﬁtable adaptations can be
ef
fected without. the use
o f
scientiﬁc measure
ments, surely
after we have reﬁned a
tech
nique similar to that suggested in this chapter,
we shall be able to make much more
eﬁective
adaptations
o f sales appeals to the publics
we are trying to reach .
F ashion
a
phenomenon
of
the
collective
mind .
One characteristic
of group minds is
the phenomenon which we call fashion .
It
may be
deﬁned
as
“ a
series
of
recurring
changes in the choices of a group of people
which , though they may be accompanied by
utility, are
not determined by it .
”
Fashion
is o ne of the most important psychical factors
aﬁecting modern selling .
Every
o ne recog
nizes its force, but few lay down any prin

SELLING TO COLLECTIVE BUYER
69
cipl es by which a seller may turn it
to his
account .
We shall be able to secure some light upon
this question if we analyze fashion, showing
what it is and h ow it operates .
We shal l do
this by itemizing several of the most promi
nent characteristic s concerned
in its
birth
and development .
1
.
The ﬁrst is universality .
It may attach
itself to any kind of human conduct—dress,
speech ,
dancing,
gait,
h air
-dressing .
A
further form of its universal ity is that it is
prevalent throughout the human race .
On
Fifth avenue and
o n the palm
-fringed beach
of a South Sea island it ﬂourishes with equal
luxuriance and exuberance .
2 .
It
Is
no t determined by usefulness ; in
deed, many fashions thri ve because they are
conspicuously
no t useful .
F or example,
o ne
thing that makes French
heels fashionable
is that they hinder a woman from working
very actively, and thus testify
to the world
that she is a woman of leisure .
3 .
A fashion at its inception must have
some element of newness .
4 .
It originally represents the desire of
some individual
to
mark
himself
off from
others.
If
a belle on R iverside Drive
or in

70
TH E M IND OF THE BUYER
! ululand secures a set of
green beads when
her companions have none , she thereby marks
herself
a s different from the rest .
5 .
D ue to the next component of fashion
imitation—the other young women in her
set
secure some green beads .
6 .
In
this
imita tion ,
we
should
observe
the higher individual is imitated by the lower.
F IG .
7 .
7 .
As a result o f this imitative action, the
individual wh o was ﬁrst made conspicuous by
the new apparel is
no longer distinguished .
The
situation may be graphically represented
by Figure 7 .
In the social group A B C D E F G , indi
vidual
D
adopted
the
novel
practice
of
wearing green beads thus raising herself above
the level of her companions .
When they , how
ever, followed her example and put on green
beads,
they raised themselves
to
her level .

SELLING TO COLLECTIVE BUYER
71
Finding
herself
again
an
undistinguished
member of the group , D adopted some new
ornament ( perhaps bows on her shoes) which
raised
her
again
above
the
common
level .
Unfortunately, her inferiors are bound to copy
this fashion ; and
so she will be obliged
to
search fo r another distinguishing mark .
8 .
After many such
changes it becomes
difficult to devise a new distinguishing mark ;
one is forced to revert to a fashion which had
its vogue
a long time before and died
o ut .
Having been quiescent for a long time, some
times a generation , it possesses the element of
novelty in the eyes of the new generation and
answers
the
purpose
of
a
new
object
of
fashion .
In other words, fashions move in
cycles .
Shoes range from wide
to
narrow
toes, high to l ow heels .
Women
’s skirts
o scil
late between extremes o f length and shortness,
narrowness and width
.
Is there some favored length of time
fo r
fashion cycles ?
Various answers have been
gi ven .
But speculation
is futile .
The true
facts can be secured only by statistical investi
gatio n .
Such , in epitome,
is the interesting story
of fashion in general .
The reader may apply

72
TH E MIND OF THE BUYER
this schema to any fashion and may easily
see its commercial implications .
R elation
between
fashion
and
selling
.
Oh
vio usly
fashion
may
stimulate
selling
by
creating and furthering
new demands .
It
may retard selling by reducing the demand
for an article which has ceased to be fashion
able .
F o r these and other reasons the seller
should
study fashion , statistically, if possible .
By means of the knowledge thus obtained he
may estimate what
to buy,
h ow much
o f
a
stock
to
lay in , when
to plan
fo r another
fashion , and how long it may run .
In introducing a new article to the public ,
the
seller may
succeed vastly better if
he
studies the psychology
o f fashion and acts
accordingly .
Thus he may utilize law
4 by
showing the buyer how the purchase of this
commodity wil l
give hini individuality and
ascendancy over the mass .
In observance
of
laws
5 and
6,
the seller would
seek
a s his
ﬁrst buyer the acknowledged leader
of the
social group .
Then he may inform the lesser
buyer that he may distinguish himself by
doing as did the most distinguished member
of the group .

H ow
TO AROU SE INTEREST
IN
A
COM M ODITY
A ttention may merge into interest .
Af ter the
buyer has given his initial momentary atten
tion
to
a
commodity,
he
does
one of
two
things : either he turns away, in which case
he fo r the time being ceases to be a prospective
buyer ; or he continues to pay attention and
remains a prospective buyer .
In the latter
case his attention becomes something more
than the mere intellectual awareness
co nsid
ered as the ﬁrst stage of the sale .
It becomes
a deeper, warmer, more rapt kind of attention ,
so different as to constitute a new stage in the
stream of thought and to deserve a new name .
We
shall
denominate
it
Interest .
In
this
chapter we shall discuss the nature of interest
in general ; and in the two following chapters ,
two of the devices that maintain it at high
peak—good feeling and imagination .
D eﬁnitions.
In describing interest we may
properly start with a deﬁnition .
Several have
been formul ated :
“ Interest is the recognition
77

78
THE M IND OF THE BUYER
of a thing which has been vitally connected
with
experience before—a
thing recognized
as
old .
”
“ Impulse
to
attend .
“ Interest
naturally arouses tendencies
to act .
“ The
roo t idea o f the term seems to be that of being
engaged , engrossed , or entirely taken up with
some activity because of its recognized worth .
“ Interest marks the annihilation of the dis
tance between the person and the materials
and results of his action ; it is a
Sign of their
organic union .
Watch
a boy
of fourteen as he bends over
a mystery tale .
Blind and deaf to sights and
sounds around him he throws his entire being
into the page .
We say he is interested .
To
achieve
such effects upon the reading public
would fulﬁll the dearest wish of the advertis
ing copy
-writer .
For, according to our last
deﬁnition of interest, when the reader of an
advertisement is interested in the description
o f a thing he identiﬁes himself with it ; he
makes an imaginary purchase ; if it turns out
to be agreeable he tries to materialize it by
actually purchasing the commodity .
F irst l aw of interest .
How to create this de
gree of interest within the mind
of the huver
is the question before us .
The answer may
be found in two psychological laws .
The ﬁrst

HOW TO AROUSE INTERE ST
79
is ;
In
o rder
to
crea te interest in
a
thing,
gie e information
about it .
We may
see the
force of this law if we examine
so me interest
in the course
of development .
Take the in
ter est of a typical young girl
in a certain
movie actor.
She knows the name of every
picture in which he has appeared ; his age ;
the color of his hair, eyes and automobile .
S he cherishes these facts and fondles them as
a precious rosary with which
sh e pays her de
votions .
They
constitute
the psychological
basis of her interest .
The astute press
-agent
knows this , and at well
-timed intervals, he
lets slip through the press a few items
. and
anecdotes about the star which fan the interest
of the fair devotee to a still whiter heat .
Sellers in
general may proﬁtably
follow
this example, disseminating information about
their wares . Progressive advertisers have been
making much use of this device within the past
few
years .
Probably
they
have
not
con
scio usly applied
oar rule ; but in studying the
effects of
the various elements in their
ad
vertisements,
they have discovered
that
in
formation
-giving
advertisements
bring
re
sul ts ; and
so they have increased the
use of
them .
Of
1 000 advertisements in
Collier
’s
Weekly fo r 1 9 02 only 220, or twenty
-two per

80
THE
MIND OF THE BUYER
cent
were
informational .
”
In
the
same
peri odical for 1 9 1 9 the per cent had increased
to
seventy
-four .
If we consider the doctrine
of
“ survival of the ﬁttest
” applicable in the
realm of advertising, we may reasonably infer
that this feature has proved
of considerable
selling value .
In giving information about a commodity
it is desirable to observe an important corol
lary to our ﬁrst law :
S tate the new in terms
of the
o ld .
For example, in giving informa
tion about a new kind of ﬁling cabinet which
will ﬁt into the drawer of an executive
’s desk,
describe some difficulty which every executive
faces ; such as the necessity of interrupting
an important conference to call a clerk and
wait
for her to fetch a record card .
This
situation is already familiar
to the buyer,
being a part of his daily experience .
It is
for this reason a valuable starting point from
which the seller may proceed
to impart
in
formation about his new product .
Classiﬁcation.
In thus utilizing old interests
the
seller has a wide variety to select from .
They may be classiﬁed as innate and acquired .
Those in the ﬁrst group are born within the
race;
As shown in Chapter II, man naturally


82
THE MIND OF THE BUYER
which we are using as
o ur chief selling point
—waterproofness .
This
is
a difﬁcult
task .
In bringing it about James advises :
“ Next ,
step by step , connect with these ﬁrst objects
and experiences, the later objects and ideas
which you wish to instill .
Associate the new
with the old in some natural and telling way,
so that
. the interest, being shed from point to
point, ﬁnally suffuses the entire system
of ob
j ects of thought .
”
Here the advertiser may
begin to appeal
to the acquired interests by
showing how these waterproo f shoes will save
money and trouble by eliminating the
neces
sity o f wearing rubbers .
Many advertisers at
this step fail to make a smooth transition be
tween the old idea and the new one .
They
fail
to show how Lincoln
’s birthday, which
they may be referring to as a matter
of con
temporary interest, is related
to their com
modify .
This is an
important matter and
deserves more than passing attention .
But
we must proceed with the task in hand .
We might group the acquired interests , upon
which a seller may play, into
two classes :
permanent and temporary .
Those in the ﬁrst
class have enough vitality to persist through
o ut the greater part
of a lifetime .
Such are
preferences for sugar ( or salt) on tomatoes,

H ow TO AROUSE INTERE ST
83
a particular political party o r fraternal order .
Those belonging
to the second group are of
less importance to the individual : interest in
a passing murder trial , in the ﬁrst aeroplane
trip across the Atlantic , in a pending presi
dential election .
In choosing informational facts with which
to evoke interest in a given commodity, we
might
group
them
into
four
classes :
( 1 )
sources of the raw materials,
( 2 )
processes
of manufacture, ( 3 ) facts about the men who
compose the ﬁrm , ( 4 ) uses for the commodity .
By thus classifying the thousand advertise
ments mentioned above we may discover some
thing about the relative merit o f these classes
of facts in advertising practice .
The results
of such arrangement are presented in per
centage form in Table V .

Show that the items featured

th e

84
THE MIND OF THE BUYER
commodity may be put .
This is true
of both
the
1 9 02 and
the
1 91 9 advertisements .
In
deed,
in the later period,
the frequency is
greater .
Perhaps the explanation is that by
describing uses the advertiser can get nearer
to the heart of his reader .
H e can talk about
the daily needs of the reader in terms already
familiar, and can show the related uses fo r
the commodity,
thus exemplifying the true
course of interest as we outlined it in earlier
paragraphs .
Perhaps, too, the effectiveness of
use may be attributed
to the human liking
for activity .
One
’s reaction toward an object
seems to be innately in terms of
“ what is to
be done with it ?”
Facts
about
processes
of
manufacture,
though formerly second in frequency,
seem to
have lost some
of their popularity , likewise
facts regarding the sources of raw materials .
The value of facts about the personnel of the
ﬁrm ,
however,
seems
to
be increasing ; the
percentage having grown from 1 1
to 1 8 dur
ing the eighteen years c overed by the investi
gation .
This may be indicative of the growing
interest which society is taking in big business,
and particularly in the personal aspect .
It
requires to know
income returns,
amounts
of excess proﬁts ;
and naturally desires to

HOW TO AROUSE INTEREST
85
know about the character and ability of the
men at the head of the affairs .
Besides, people
like to read about successful men in order to
discover the
secret of their success .
Howsoever we explain these qualities, we
know for certain that during the great ex
pansion of
advertising
of the past
twenty
years,
the
use
of information
-giving
adver
tisements
has
increased
in
the
ratio
from
twenty
-two to seventy
-four in a hundred .
And
that
among
informational
facts,
certain
groups have been numerically favored over
others .
The enterprising copy
-writer who de
sires to proﬁt by the experience of the past
may well adopt the practice of arousing inter
est by means of informational copy, and may
well
consider
seriously
the
results
o f our
investigation
showing the relative value
of
different classes of interest
-evoking facts .
Second l aw of interest .
Leaving now the un
limited possibilities of variation in the spread
ing of information about a commodity, let us
pass on to another phase .
F o r there is another
psychological law of interest :
In
o rder
to
create interest in
a thing,
arouse
activity to
ward it .
We may
see this law exempliﬁed
in the methods pursued by vari ous organiza

86
THE MIND OF THE BUYER
tions
in
enlisting
the
interest
of
certain
persons .
When a hospital desires to secure
a wealthy patroness it places her on the Board
of Directors ; then on some important com
mittee.
A s she busies herself with the ad airs
of th e institution she becomes interested in it,
and soo n makes
the hoped
-for ﬁnancial con
tributions.
Opportunities
fo r
the
utilization
of
this
prescription are numerous enough in direct
personal
selling .
The salesman may induce
the buyer to feel the texture of the silk, take
a
ri de in
the
'
automobil e, try the piano .
A
pertinent example is given in this description
o f the method employed by salesmen sent out
to introduce
a new cooking product
to the
housewives of the country
The canvasser knock
ed
at the door of the house .
When
the door
was opened,
the c anvasser immediately
removed
his hat , pl acing it
o n the ﬂoor of the piazza or
o n the rail
if
o ne were h andy.
U sing
a
set phrase
such
as : ‘M adam, I
am here to
show yo u Crisco, the new
sho rtening,
’ he offered
her with his two h ands
a pail of Crisco .
The instant that
the woman took the
p ail from
the c anvasser
’s h ands
he
drew
a p encil from his pock
et
and held it in his right hand ,
at
the
same time he drew from
another p ock
et
a coupon
which he held in his left hand .
This was
so that the woman
could
not h and back the
p ail to the canvasser.
The most
she could do was to drop
o r place it
o n the
ﬂoor .
Then
the
conversation
started .
”

HOW TO AROUSE INTEREST
87
Opportunities to arouse activity on the part
of the buyer are not quite so numerous in ad
vertising
.
There are some , however, which
when exploited, serve the purpose admirably .
Here belong coupons to be torn
oﬁ, requests
for names of friends and dealers , offers of
prizes for the solution of puzzles , reproduction
of cartoons , composition of limericks .
All
these devices,
which have established
their
utility by their persistence in advertising, de
rive
their
psychological
justiﬁcation
from
their ability
to arouse interest through
ac
tivity
.
Summary
.
We have now answered the ques
tion posited at the beginning of this chapter .
We have made a psychological
analysis of
interest ; have desc ri bed the kinds of interest
common
to
the
human
species ;
and
have
formulated two laws fo r the development of
interest .
We have seen that these laws are not merely
theoretical formulations .
By an investigation
of advertising practice we found their prac
tical veriﬁcation in the conscious or
uncon
scious use of them by successful sellers .
By
a more minute analysis
of the speciﬁc
stimu
lants to interest which have been employed,

88
THE
MIND OF THE BUYER
we have discovered which ones are likely to
have the strongest appeal .
It should be remarked that though we may
seem to have treated interest as
a distinct
stage of the sale, we do no t thereby imply that
it is entirely separate from the other stages .
As a matter of fact, once it is aroused, it per
sists throughout the sale, in desire, conﬁdence ,
decision and satisfaction .
We shall
now proceed to discuss two
com
ponents
o f the mental stream—good feeling
and imagination—which are important stimu
lants to the growth
o f interest .

example,
a
scientist
wh o
i nvestigatedibthe
effect
o f various stimuli upon the
ex tenti tbi
the knee -jerk, discovered that pleasant music
increased the extent
of the movement .
We
cannot accept
unqualiﬁedly this thoroughgo~
ing
relationship
between
pleasantness
. and
heightening of bodily powers, because of cer
tain contradictory evidence which we shall
not enter into here .
Nevertheless the theory
offers interesting possibilities fo r speculation
concerning the power of pleasant feelings over
the actions of the buyer.
Another view is somewhat more credible ,
namely, that pleasant feelings with respect to
an object are accompanied by movements
to
ward,
while unpleasant feelings are aecom
panied by movements
away from, the object .
Something of this sort seems to happen when
we make experiments upon a simple organism
like the amoeba .
When we place
o ne kind
of object in his neighborhood he moves toward
it ; when we place there another kind of object ,
he quickly moves away .
An infant reacts
similarly .
To a shiny ball dangling before his
eyes he reaches forth his hands ; from a sharp
pin he draws away .
It is probable that an adult reacts with
similar positive and negative movements
ac

cording as he is confronted with an object
which is pleasing
o r displeasing .
Sometimes
his movements of expansion and retraction
are easily discernible .
At other times they
are minute, and perceptible only by means of
delicate measuring instruments .
For though
in the course
of our civilized existence we
learn to conceal our outward manifestations
of feeling, we rarely succeed in repressing the
inner ones .
They occur without the interp o s1
tion of the will .
And they form a large ma
j o rity of the signs of unpleasantness .
They
are, as we say, instinctive —to be more thor
oughly discussed in Chapter XI .
Though we
shall not enumerate them here, we shall in
dicate their astonishing multiplicity by men
tioning a few .
It is well known
that the
sweat glands and saliva glands are affected
by strong feeling .
Other glands no t so well
known are also aroused ,
such as the thyroid,
pituitary,
pineal ,
adrenal .
Changes
also
occur in the circulatory system ;
the heart
beats change in rate ; and th e arteries expand
as in blushing, or contract as in paling .
Elec
tric
disturbances
oc cur~ man being a
sort
of electric battery .
Chemical reactions occur .
Is this
no t proved by
' the fact that the hair
may turn white in a single night ?


94
THE MIND OF THE BUYER
Interpreting good feeling
a s hilarious humor
they conceive their role to be that of a court
jester ; to manufacture a constant ﬂow of wit
with which
to keep the spirits of the buyer
at a high pitch .
Some advertisers a ct on the same principle,
straining every nerve to evolve a humorous
story, picture
o r limerick .
Whether this de
vice is
successful
o r not is seriously open to
question .
If we seek the testimony to
be
found in the practices of the majority
of
ad
vertisers we
ﬁn d scant use of humor as a
stimulant to good feeling .
In an investigation
of the advertisements appearing in
Co llier
’s
Weekly and H arp er
’s Weekly between
1 902
and 1 9 1 9 , the author found that the number
of humorous advertisements never exceeded
seven in 1 00
.
If we place any reliance upon
the historical method as an index of successful
selling practices, we may conclude that few
advertisers
have
found
humor
a
valuable
selling aid .
P erhap s this apparent lack of success is not
due
to
any
intrinsic
unproﬁtabl eness
in
humor o r to any violent distaste for it on the
part of the buyer .
The apparent
success of a
few such mildly humorous devices as the dog

’s Voice
”
' the Gold

GOOD FEELING A REQUISITE
95
Dust twins ;
and the cheery chef of Cream of
Wheat suggests this .
Probably the failure
of certain similar attempts is due to the poor
quality of humor employed .
To
be funny
artistically
requires
the
services
of
a
real
humorist .
An advertiser may have ﬁrst
-rate
ability as a composer of
“ straight
” copy with
out being
a clever humorist .
In recognition
of this fact some advertisers desirous of using
humor
have
lately
called
in
professional
humorists, particularly cartoonists,
and have
asked them
to prepare copy containing the
same
funny
situations
that
have
already
caught the public fancy .
Such commercial
izatio ns of expert humor
a re
to o recent to
permit us
to draw conclusions .
After
sufﬁ
cient trial , however, they may tell whether
or not our previous failures
_in humorous c opy
were due to the ineptness of copy
-writers .
Other stimulants of good feeling
.
But humor
is not the only method by which to generate
good feeling .
Pleasantness need not take the
form of hilarity .
It may be esthetic ; called
up by pleasing combinations of colors or pleas
ing lines of a package .
It may consist
of the
mild feeling of recognition called up by fre
queney
of
repetition
of
the
sales
message
( Chapter III )
.
It may be the feeling which

9 6
THE MIND OF THE BUYER
in the preceding chapter we called interest,
generated by the linkage
of
old with
new .
It may be one
of the feelings accompanying
desire ,
where
pleasant old experiences are
attached to new objects vividly projected into
the future
( Chapter VIII )
.
In an intense
form it may consist of some pleasant feeling
( in this case called emotion )
accompanying
instinctive
forms
of
reaction
discussed
in
Chapter XI .
Supremely important is that form of pleas
antness which , in
o ur ﬁnal chapter we shall
discuss under the name, satisfaction .
There
we shall supplement this discussion by show
ing that good feeling, which is the true goal
of
the
sale ,
should constitute ,
indeed,
the
great sub stratum in the mind of the buyer .
Until then we shall rest content with th e con
tention of this chapter, namely, that by means
o f arousing pleasant feelings, the seller calls
forth within the buyer a number
o f instinc
tive movements, great and small ; which release
a great amount
of nervous energy, which the
seller may direct into the act
o f purchase .


98
THE M IND OF THE BUYER
may have actual images of things touched ;
auditory images of things heard ; gustatory
images of things tasted ; olfactory images
o f
things smelled ; and so on through the entire
range of sensations .
Th e l aw
of asso ciation .
If we try t o account
for this
power
of imaging,
we
must
refer
to the nature of brain tissue , which is
so con
stituted that any object impressed upon the
senses makes a permanent modiﬁcation in the
brain ;
to recall the object later, one needs
only
to
revive this pathway .
One
usually
accomplishes this revival by stimulating
an
other pathway which was stimulated when the
ﬁrst
o ne was made .
As a rule, several path
ways are stimulated at once .
They are asso
ciated, we say .
This, because our experiences
are necessarily related to each other ; either
they follow closely upon each other
’s heels ;
or else they possess common elements .
As
a result, whenever a new object ( a commodity
for
sale )
stimulates
o ne pathway it revives
another at the same time .
Thus the
seller
h a s the power
to call up
within the mind of the buyer any objects ex
perienced in the past ; reviving them in the
form of images .
For example , with the word
“ Wrigley,
” he may call up
“ gum,
” which has

the buyer appreciate
the glories of apples
from the Hood River valley he will be able to
arouse mental
visio ns of apples more easily
than
mental
tastes,
smells
and
“ touches .
This is to be expected because images are de
rived from previous sensory experiences ; and
the ordinary buyer has come into contact with
apples more frequently
through
sight
than
th rough his other senses .
Assuredly, however,
any
of the other forms of imagery may arise,
and the seller may legitimately appeal to any
variety that he wishes .
Indeed, in advertis

smells
with
great
effectiveness

strength
and novelty and

Images may be either clear or obscure .
Some are so clear as to be hardly distinguish
able from original
sensations .
The extreme
form of such self
-deception is called hallucina
tion .
N o t all images come with this degree of
clearness, however .
Some are obscure, ﬂeeting
and sketchy, almost to the vanishing point .
Many times one tries to image the voice of an
absent friend with no more revival than per
haps a phrase or two and the vague
sugges
tion
of an intonation .
In view of this fact, the seller who intends


1 02
THE MIND OF THE BUYER
To achieve this kind
of deﬁniteness is
a
diﬁcul t task .
Our lazy human nature tempts
us to follow the line of least resistance and to
use general terms .
We are prone to describ e
all things with the same words :
“wonderful ,
”
“ great bargain ,
”
“immense
saving .

These
are not descriptive words at all ; they give no
hint of the nature or quality
of the article .
They may with
equal pertinency be applied
to a house and lot, an automobile, a pair of
gloves, a block of oil stock .
One explanation of
o ur proneness toward
the use of general ,
indeﬁnite

poverty

o ur vocabularies .
We have not
formed the habit of using words of variety
sufﬁcient for the designation of ﬁne shades
of meaning.
The remedy is obvious ; develop
a full and exact vocabulary .
In describing
a commodity, search
o ut words which ﬁt it
exactly and which represent its varied quali
ties vividly in the mind of the buyer .

Images may bring strong feelings in
their train .
This is especially true of infre
quent but. unusually vivid images .
In
en
circling the sale with
pleasant feelings
a s
recommended in Chapter VI, the seller may
use these with great proﬁt.
There are certain
images that generally bring pleasant feelings

THE IMAGINATION OF THE BUYER
1 03
—images
of
eating
ice
-cream
and
similar
dainties .
These are much used by
a certain
candy company in advertising its chocolates .
There are other images that generally bring
unpleasant
feelings— noisome
animals
and
reptiles .
Besides
such
general
tendencies
there are likes and dislikes peculiar to certain
individuals—idiosyncracies developed in the
course of experience .
The seller should study
them and use only those images which have
pleasant associations .
Empathy in the sale.
One interesting use to
which we occasionally put mental images is
in that process called
“ empathy .
”
Empathy
may be deﬁned as
“ the process of humanizing
objects,
of reading
o r feeling ourselves into
them .
”
We are
so constituted that we are
inclined
to
place ourselves
imaginally into
situations that may be presented before us .
We do this sometimes over
so simple a thing
as a straight line .
If it
slants at a certain
angle without any visible means of support
it gives us an uncomfortable feeling .
We feel
as though we were the line ;
and to hold an
attitude of such obliquity gives us uncomfort
able feelings
o f strain .
The reader may note
such feelings as he looks at Figure

The

unpleasant
feelings .
Architects make allowance for such conditions
in planning the lines of a building
.
They
know that abrupt corners give a feeling of
sharpness ; straight lines, a feeling of hard
ness ; curves,
a
feeling of softness .

rather
than

For
they know that if it were horizontal , the
ob
server, with his empathetic tendency, would
feel that he ought
to support it
to keep it
from falling .
If it is already tilted upward,
however, he does not feel obliged
to push it
up any higher .
Sellers
should observe this
empathetic
tendency in human nature and
should
make
allowances
for
it in
present
ing their wares .

made through such an investment.
He
vir
tually takes
a piece out of his past and pro
j ects it into the future , in relation to the new
object .
We described this relation between
the new and the ol d in Chapter V .
3 .
This forward projection
of the buyer
’s
past is quite likely to be in terms of the images
discussed in Chapter VII .
The buyer creates
pictures
of himself bowling along the boul e
va rds in the motor car, no longer as passenger
but as driver .
He imagines the things that
he will
do with
the dividends from his
oil
stock .
4 .
These trains of images are pleasantly
toned
( see
Chapters
VI
and
VII )
And
generally speaking
the greater the pleasant
ness the
greater the desire .
We might lay
it down as a rule that one
who wishes
to
strengthen the buyer
’s desire
fo r an object
shoul d arouse within him
strong feelings of
pleasantness .
The mechanism for arousing
these is the use of the imagery discussed in
Chapter V
( paragraph
Call
up vivid
images from the buyer
’s past, being careful
that they be markedly pleasant .
Then mix
them into
a picture showing future possibil i
ties .

and enjoying a picnic dinner in a shady grove .
Embellish every selling point with
deﬁnite
clean
-cut images as directed in Chapter VII .
An extraordinarily effective example of this
is the slogan
“ Like mother used
to make .
”
Here are all the elements that go to produce
strong
desire :
visual
images
of
the
fat,
browned minc e pie of childhood days ; gusta
tory images
of sinking one
’s teeth into the
mass and allowing the ﬂavor to permeate the
mouth ; olfactory images of the spicy sweetish
odor as the pie comes smoking from the oven ;
and above all the image of mother
’s gentle
smile as she cuts the golden object and dis
penses it around the table .
Everything con
nected with this picture is pleasant in retro
spect .
It is, therefore, a capital segment of
experience to project into the future in rela
tion to
a new kind of mince meat .
5 .
S o vivid are these images, and
so allur
ing, that they lead the buyer to make move
ments toward the object about which
they
center.
These movements are a very impor
tant part
of the desire .
They are always
there .
An infant evinces a desire for a watch
by reaching toward it .
An adult also has an
impulse
to reach out and touch the object
of his desire .
True, under the repressive in

THE MIND OF THE BUYER
ﬂuence of civilization he often inhibits the
outward signs of movement ; still he moves
if only by twitching his muscles .
Many times
he acts in ways unknown to himself, through
some of the hidden muscles and glands men
tio ned in Chapter VI .
Imperceptible though
they are, these faint, incipient movements con
stitute a vital part of desire .
When the movements of the buyer are gross
enough
to be observable, the seller may
use
them as indices to determine h ow highly de
vel oped the desire is .
For in general as the
buyer becomes more desirous of the object he
makes more violent movements toward it .
He
grasps it with ﬁrmer grip ; or makes more
minute examination
of it ; or sits down in it
with an air
o f proprietorship .
6 .
If the ﬁrst movement toward an object
results in its purchase, desire does
not last
very long .
Usually, however, the ﬁrst move
ment does
not bring about the attainment of
the object .
It is blocked in some way .
The
obstruction may be material : an intervening
window glass ; distance from the object pic
tured .
Or it may be mental : an idea of some
other object which is still more strongly de
sired .
7 .
This obstruction is accompanied by nu

’s movements, the seller
usually employs reason , suggestion, and other
mental aids discussed throughout this book .

The pleasure following the fulﬁllment
of desire is that same mental condition which
in Chapter XIV we shall call
“ satisfaction .

they
are
unavoidable ;

to

Summary
.
We shall conclude this chapter,
at the
risk
of undue repetition, by character
izing desire as
a stage in the mental stream
akin to interest but a step beyond .
A stage
in which
the buyer fastens certain past ex
periences upon a framework of future pros

He likes the ensemble
so well that he reaches

to c reate public conﬁdence in
“ 57 varieties .
The large money values which are sometimes
estimated to inhere in conﬁdence ( sometimes
called the good will of a concern ) are further
evidences
of its large place in business .
In
arriving at such an evaluation , o ne accountant
writes :
“ Good will is a legitimate asset in
an industrial
enterprise ,
and
the most
a c
cepted method of computing the amount
of
good will is to take the total proﬁts fo r the
last ﬁve years and deduct from them ﬁve
years
’ interest on the capitalization at 7 per
cent per annum ; the balance is good will .
”
Conﬁdence and go od will are habits.
In busi
ness inventories conﬁdence,
o r good will , is
usually spoken
of as
o ne of the
“ intangible
”
assets
of
a
ﬁrm, and
is thereby classed as
something
that
is
only
theoretically
ex
istent .
It is our purpose in this chapter to
show that though it is intangible it is never
thel ess real .
That in the process of the sale
it occupies a place second to none of the other
processes we are describing .
If any
o ne were
to
ask us where lurks this invisible asset,
where it makes it habitat, we should answer,
In the mind of the buyer .
It exists there as
a system
of habits which the seller has built
up by dint of much labor and cost .
These

CON FIDENCE AND GOOD WILL
1 1 9
habits consist of acts
o r tendencies that are
favorable
to
the seller and
his commodity
.
The good will belonging to a certain haber
da shery dealer consists psychologically in my
habit of turning in at his door rather than
that of his competitor when I wish
to buy
collars .
The good will of a certain ﬁrm of
collar manufacturers consists of my habit of
asking for their brand rather than another,
and o f recommending it to my friends .
These
habits, while in a sense belonging to me, be
long just as truly to the seller ; they are paid
for by the money which he has used in
ad
vertising and by the pains he has taken
to
serve me .
It shall be our purpose in this chapter to
describe the processes through which
these
habits of conﬁdence and good will are built
up .
Genesis and development
of
conﬁdence.
It is
possible fo r the
seller to build up conﬁdence
because of a certain fundamental trait in the
buyer
’s mind .
To ﬁnd its roots we shall be
obliged
to probe far back into the days of
infancy .
There, at the time when the mental
life of the individual is ﬁrst unfolding, we
shall ﬁnd the roots of that which bloo ms forth
as adult conﬁdence .
When we thus examine

1 20
TH E MIND OF THE BUYER
the mental life
of the infant, we ﬁnd as the
ﬁrst forerunner of conﬁdence
a simple,
in
choate mental attitude which can hardly be
expressed by any more deﬁnite term than
‘a
“ feeling
of
simple
-reality
” ; this is attached
to every object. of experience .
In every act
of perceiving the infant implicitly says,
“ Ah !
I sense something here ; I guess I can rely
upon my senses
”
He feels that if he can
sense the object
. it must really be there .
Ex
istence is, for him , simply presence .
What
ever is, is real .
There is no hint
o f disbelief
in anything he can sense ; there is
no reason
fo r anything but conﬁdence in its existence .
This feeling,
crude and positive,
which
at
taches to the objects
o f infantile experience,
may
b e
inelegantly
called
a.
feeling
of
“ thereness .
”
This primeval predecessor of the co nﬁdence
to
-be has
been
called
by
o ne
p sychologist
( Bain )
“primitive credulity .
”
Bain says that
the mind is
so constituted that it tends
to
accept
as
true
every
statement made
( see
page
Every impression made upon the
mind of a child tends to receive credence, and
is accepted unless it is oﬁset by a contrary im
pression .
N ow in the mind of the child most
impressions come without any contradictory

THE MIND OF THE BUYER
and failing, makes him doubt the statement
that Santa Claus enters through that passage .
After a number of such experiences, coming
more frequently as adulthood approaches, the
individual forms the habit of
suppressing his
innate tendencies to credulity .
He tests every
one of his feelings of reality with his other
experiences .
He tentatively acts upon them
to see if they bring the response
to be ex
pected, and he places alongside them the ideas
gained from former experiences .
If his move
ments do
no t result in satisfactory response,
he doubts .
If the new impression is belied
by his pa st experiences he doubts .
Only if
the
new object gives full and expected
re
spouse to his testing movements, and agrees
with his previous experiences is his doubt
re
solved and changed into conﬁdence .
When such a test results favorably it brings
satisfaction and appeasement
of desire .
In
order
to understand how
great may be this
satisfaction after the resolution of
a doubt,
one has only to read the
“ Meditations
” of some
of the church Fathers , who, after having been
racked and torn by religious doubts ,
came
to a state
o f perfect belief and trust .
There
to o one may secure illuminating understand
ing of the psychological conditions attending

CONFIDENCE AND GOOD WILL
1 23
full conﬁdence .
After reading these descrip
tions a seller may understand more clearly
what a powerful ally he has in the mind
o f
a buyer who maintains implicit conﬁdence in
his ( the seller
’s) goo ds .
Such in outline is the genesis and develop
ment
o f conﬁdence in the lifetime
of the in
dividual .
From a crude,
primitive,
almost
animalistic
“ sensation
-co eﬁicient,
”
as
one
psychologist
( Baldwin )
puts it, it develops
by a process of testing of thought with ex
ternal ity,
into
the
reﬁned
and
substantial
force that we call by such meaningful and
solemn words as belief, trust, credit , faith .
To create this is
a life
-time task .
Now we
see why it often requires
a long time to build
up public conﬁdence in certain commodities .
F o r example, it took a long time for the public
to develop conﬁdence in
th e business of
ad
vertising
as such ; because in the early days
of advertising,
the buyer,
trusting his ﬁrst
impressions tinged with
“ primitive credulity,
”
attempted to act upon them and was deceived .
He found unreality where he had attributed
reality .
For a long time , then , whenever he
was tempted to act on an advertisement , he
recalled his ﬁrst unpleasant experiences and
they contradicted the statements he was read

1 24
TH E MIND OF THE BUYER
ing .
So he exclaimed, paraphrasing the dis
gruntled scriptural writer,
“All advertisers
are liars ; I will
not believe any of them .
”
If
within
recent years the buying public
h as
developed more conﬁdence in advertising it is
because
advertisers
have
learned
to
make
sta tements which agree with reality and which
when acted upon by the buyer, bring
satisfa c
tory responses .
Conﬁdence is stable but fragile.
One peculiar
ity about conﬁdence is that after it has passed
through the sta ge
o f doubt and has secured
the right to exist by means
of a long agree
ment
between
impression
(
“ simple
reality
feelings
” ) and fact, then it stands square and
solid .
We say
of an individual in whom we
have great conﬁdence,
“ I would trust him with
my last dollar .
”
And this solidity endures
as long as the feeling of reality can attach
itself unimpededl y to the object .
But let o ne
slip occur and the structure is ruined .
Para
do x ical as it may seem , conﬁdence is at the
same time very stable and very fragile .
No
where is this demonstrated more forcibly than
in the business of banking .
The conﬁdence
which people may hold in a bank for genera
tions may be shattered over night .
Conﬁdence, the goal of bankadvertising
.
The


1 26
THE MIND OF THE BUYER
is justiﬁed .
For what banks
seek through
advertising is ﬁrst conﬁdence, then deposits .
They are obliged to keep conﬁdence as their
chief aim .
They know that at best it is a pre
carious and fragile entity, which ever so slight
a thing may disturb ; hence they refrain from
employing any methods that may by their
eccentricity shock it .
Two
devices for instilling
conﬁdence .
From
the foregoing analysis o f conﬁdence the reader
is prepared to see what usually passes in the
mind of the buyer when he is developing con
ﬁdence in a commodity .
Due to his
“ primitive
credulity
” the buyer tends to believe the ﬁrst
statement made about the commodity .
So
‘on ,
however, he thinks of
some past experiences
which controvert the statement , which arouse
within his mind disbeliefs, and which act as in
hibitio ns to the purchase
o f the commodity .
These the
seller must batter down .
He may
use two psychological aids
The ﬁrst
is repetition .
An assertion
re
p eated
often
enough
will
go
far
toward
creating belief in it .
This is the psychological
justiﬁcation
for
the
constant
use
of
such
slogans as,
“ Ask the man
wh o owns one
” ;
“ There
’s a reason
”
;
“ 9 9 44/1 00% pure
” ;
“ An
apple a day keeps the doctor away
” ;
“ The ut

CONFIDENCE AND GOOD WILL
1 27
most in cigarettes
” ;
“ The most beautiful car
in America .
”
The second is
to
arouse
and maintain a
feeling
of
satisfaction
within
the
buyer.
Throughout
o ur
discussion
we
have
called
conﬁdence , both in its primitive state and its
reﬁned state, a feeling .
We have done this
designedly .
For
conﬁdence
is
marked
by
something warm and pleasant— it
is a true
feeling as we deﬁned the term in Chapter VI .
As we stated in that chapter, feeling is ever
an animus to action .
A
seller may give ever
so convincing arguments ; he may bristle with
reasons why the buyer
should purchase his
article ; but if he fail to create conﬁdence he
will
no t make the
sale .
We may paraphrase
the
old adage
to read :
“ A man convinced
without the feeling of conﬁdence is of the same
opinion still .
”
S ummary
.
We h ave here l aid
’
do wn the die
tum that conﬁdence is inevitable in the sale .
Tho
-ugh it need not always appear as
stage
four, where we have placed it in the logical out
line of this book,
still it usually comes here in
the
sale of a new commodity .
Wherever it
comes, it must exist in some degree o f strength ,
the greater the better . And we cited some com
modities to which it adheres with the
solidity

1 28
TH E MIND OF THE BUYER
of Gibraltar .
Though it may b e strong and
well
-grounded, however, it may, under very
slight provocation and lack of faithfulness,
crumble in a moment .
Therefore
the
seller
must exercise constant watchfulness
to
see
that he keeps his pledges and fulﬁl ls the ex
p ectations of those
wh o
trust him and his
goo ds .
Though conﬁdence is usually regarded as
an
“intangible
” asset , we showed that it has
real
existence ; and that its value may be
reckoned in dollars and cents .
P sychol ogi
cally speaking we described it as a set of habits
incul cated within the buyer— motor
habits
o f responding to the seller
’s appeals with acts
of purchase .
\W e showed the simple innate
trait upon which it is based, and related how
from this elemental germ it grows to a high
plane of reﬁnement and constancy .
As speciﬁc psychological aids in the mold
ing of this into perfect form we recommend
repetition and the maintenance of pleasa nt
feeling .
The form which thi s latter should
take is the complete satisfaction
of the needs
o f the buyer .



CHAPTER TEN

R eason and the will .
After passing through
th e stages just described, the buyer is
ready
to perform the act of purchase .
His condition
of mind at this moment is unique .
It is called
by such names as decision , resolution , will ,
volition,
psychological
moment .
We
shall
discuss its most critical aspect in
Chapter
XIII under the caption ,
The Psychological
Moment .
Meanwhile we shall discuss several
subordinate mental processes that
. may
im
mediately precede it and inﬂuence it : reason
ing, instinct , suggestion .
These , we hasten
to admit, may be used
eﬁectively at earlier
stages of the sale ; but they are the battery of
forces which the seller usually reserves for the
crucial moment
o f decision ; hence we have
waited until this point to discuss them .
A nalysis
of
reasoning
.
When
a person rea
sons,
he goes
through
four
rather
clearly
marked stages .
In his mental stream we may
distinguish four divisions :
( 1 ) the awareness
1 31

1 32
TH E MIND o r
TH E
B U Y ER
of a difﬁculty ; ( 2 )
the location of the difﬁ
culty ; ( 3 ) the search fo r a solution ; ( 4) the
solution .
By way of illustration let us imagine a sale
in which
th e buyer decides to buy an auto
mobile tire through a process
of practically
pure reasoning .
Let us suppose that
o ur tire
features
a
device
for
preventing
rim
-cuts .
How shall we direct the reasoning processes
of the buyer so that he will make a purchase ?
R ecognition
of a difﬁculty
.
First we should
lead him to
see that o ne of his great
a utomo
biling problems is the short life
of his tires .
He will doubtless readily admit this
to
be
true .
Though there might be circumstances
under which the buyer would not have such
a clear consciousness o f the problem ; in which
case the task of the seller is
to picture the
problem in extraordinarily vivid terms .
We
shall revert to this point in a later paragraph .
Lo cation of difﬁculty
.
Our second task is to
locate the difﬁculty by showing the cause
of
such rapid deterioration of tires .
We
shall
locate this difﬁculty in the wearing by the
rim .
We might demonstrate this graphically
by picking up an
ol d tire and
showing the
buyer
h ow the walls
of the tire have been
broken down by the sharp impact with
the


134
THE MIND OF
TH E BUYER
graphic terms
so
that the
“ buyer
”
will re
spo nd readily when shown that the way
o f
salvation is the solution to his problem .
In
deed, a successful evangelist is perforce an
excellent salesman ; and he can teach the seller
of secular wares many things about the mind
of the buyer .
Presentation
of
solution.
Our third task is
to offer
solutions
o f the di fﬁculty .
If other
solutions than ours have been tried unsuccess
fully we might refer t o them and show how
they failed .
Here we might present ﬁgures
showing the average lifetime
of a number
of
tires
of standard make ; then ﬁgures showing
the average length of life of
o ur
no
-rim
-cut
tire .
Thus we show that the latter is the
solution
of the problem .
During this
stage come the
“ arguments
”
with which a train
o f reasoning
is usually
conducted .
It is at this stage that the buyer
may become an active opponent instead of
a
passive listener to our encomiums .
He may
bring up objections, consisting of cases from
past experience in which our commodity might
conceivably fail .
He may put forth ideas
of his own and test them
o ut against our
proposed solution .
The situation at this point
may be likened to a court
-room scene in which

TH E POWER OF REASON
1 35
evidence is submitted and arguments are pre
sented fo r and against .
As each
bit of evi
dence is submitted, the judge
( buyer)
must
test it ; must weight it and check it up against
experience .
As we ( the seller) defend
o ur product we
must produce exactly the evidence necessa ry
to refute every objection .
We must show by
actual
demonstration
how
strong
are
the
ﬁbers in our fabric ;
h o w numerous are the
layers ; and h ow we have padded with inde
structibl e material the strategic
spot at which
the cuts occur .
All this implies
. that the salesman has exact
and complete knowledge
o f the processes by
which the tires are manufactured, and it em
phasizes again the statement made in Chapter
V, that
the seller shoul d
be thoroughly
a c
quainted with his product .
Correct
solution
of
the
difﬁculty
.
But we
have reached the last step of the train of rea
soning
without
noting it
explicitly .
It
is
here that the buyer recognizes that
o ur tires
will
solve
his
problem .
The
moment
an
no unces itself by being prefaced with
“ there
fore .
”
If the train
o f reasoning has been
skillfully conducted it will bring a conclusion
tinged with ﬁnality .
It
will
come
clothed

with conﬁdence and belief .
Here we should

all

Points for special attention .
In appealing to
the buyer through reason, the seller should
guard himself with particular care in several
The ﬁrst is to delineate the problem
of the
buyer with exceeding sharpness .
To do this
he must study the buyer
’s needs beforehand .
Some one has remarked that a successful sales
man must know more about the buyer
’s busi
ness than the buyer does himself .
The second is to avoid wandering from the
point at issue .
The temptations to talk aim
lessly are great, especially at stage three of
a
train of reasoning .
In order to avoid this the
salesman might well outline a
“ sermonette
”
beforehand according to this pattern

justifying the choice which
they know the
buyer has already implicitly made through
feeling .
Aside
from
this vicarious
role,
however,
reason plays a serious and often decisive part
in the sale .
Particul arly is this the case when
selling to such routine buyers as professional
purchasing agents .
To know h ow to conduct
a reasoned
sale properly should, therefore , be
made a matter of serious study by every in
telligent seller .

CHAPTER ELEVEN
INSTINCTIVE FA CTORS
Introduction .
Broadly speaking, the actions
of the buyer have two
sources : habits formed
in his own lifetime and inheritances from pre
vio us
generations .
We have considered the
ﬁrst with considerable detail in our discussions
of
repetition ,
imagination,
interest,
desire ,
reason ; pointing out devices by which to evoke
the
so
-called
habitual
actions .
We
have
touched
only
lightly,
however,
upon
the
sources
o f the
second class though we have
been obliged to
take
som
e notice
o f them ,
particularly when discussing attention and
feeling .
We
shall now atone fo r this neglect
by devoting an entire chapter to them .
Deﬁnition of instinctiv e action .
We call these
inherited
factors
instinctive,
deﬁning
the
term as follows :
An instinctive act is a series
of acts of an heredita ry nature, having a deﬁ
nite though
no n
-conscious end ,
and
accom
panied by a ch aracteri stic feeling .
Let us
1 39

1 40
THE MIND OF THE BUYER
analyze this deﬁnition and point o ut the char
acteristics
of instinctive action .
Characteristics
of instinctive
action .
1
.
It is very complicated .
It is not a simple,
single act like the wink of an eye .
Rather
is it made up of a number of simple acts .
Ob
serve the bird as sh e goes through the instinc
tive act
of nest
-building .
She performs a
series
of simple actions : picking up a string
here, a twig there,
a hair yonder ; and laying
them in the nest .
In
the same way the in
stinctive actions of humans consist of separate
acts
chained
together,
though
this
linkage
should be interpreted according to the follow
ing paragraph :
2 .
The word
“ series
implies
no t merely
multiplicity of acts but sequence as well .
The
separate simple acts comprising an instinctive
act almost invariably occur in the same order,
and as we shall show presently, without being
planned by the individual .
A striking ex
ample o f this will be furnished by the follow
ing description
“ A certain bettle of the genus S ita ris l ays its
eggs
at the
entrance
o f the
subterranean galleries
exc avated by
a kind
o f mason bee .
From these
eggs the larvae
a re h atched
in
autumn
as
active little insects very different from
the
ordinary type
o f beetle grub, having
six legs
e ach
a rmed
with
a
sharp curved hook
.
In
the winter they
become


1 42
TH E MIND OF THE BUYER
bee because
exp erience has taught it that
such
a procedure
brings with
it
satisfactory consequence s .
A t
no
stage of
the
complex
process
c a n intelligence, bas ed
o n individual
experience, be
admitted
as
a factor .
If there be
experience ,
it must be the inherited
exp erience
o f
ancestors who have,
each in turn, done much the
same .
”
This illustration shows the invariable se
q uence with which the simple components of
a complex instinctive act follow each other .
Upon
superﬁcial
examination
o ne
might
conclude that instinctive acts cannot be dif
ferentiated
one
from
the
other,
because
several may contain identical elementary acts .
This is true, but we
shall ﬁnd on closer ex
amination, that. though the elementary com
p o nents of several instinctive
acts may
, be
identical ,
still in each instinctive pattern they
are linked together in a unique order .
For
example , though the simple act of ﬂushing
in the face may occur in connection with
several complicated instinctive actions, such
as acts
of shyness, embarrassment, modesty,
even
of pugnacity ; still it comes surrounded
by other elementary acts which
give it in
each case, a different
setting .
We thus
say
that each instinctive act has a distinct pattern
regardless o f the cloth of which it is made .
3 .
Our deﬁnition next emphasizes the fact

INSTINCTIVE FACTORS
1 43
that instinctive actions are inherited .
There
is a volume of signiﬁcance in this for the
seller, which we shall point out presently .
For the moment , let
us elaborate upon the
meaning
of the term inheritance in
general .
a .
Let us note ﬁrst that anything inherited
may come not merely from immediate parents
but also from all preceding generations in the
line of descent .
Some of th e things we inherit
may have originated millions of years
ago
.
b .
An act which h as passed down through
so many generations is thus to be found in
all the members
of the species .
For example ,
all human beings tend to act in about the same
way when afraid .
c .
An inherited act is ﬁrmly ﬁxed .
It has
been ingrained within
so many
generation s
and transmitted so faithfully from generation
to generation that it is qui te ﬁrmly embedded
within the organism of the last inheritor .
d .
It may be quickly aroused .
This fol
lows from the fact that the pathways for it
are well marked out in the nervous system .
N ow
to
wear down a pathway for non
-in
herited action requires considerable time .
To
do
so
through reasoning processes,
for ex
ample , requires the time necessary for the
nervous impulse to travel to the brain , perhaps

1 44
THE MIND OF THE BUYER
calling up several idea
-systems in turn, while
the individual cogitates about the matter and
debates fo r and against the suggested action .
Instinctive
action ,
however,
being
already
inherent in
th e organism , requires
no
appre
ciabl e time for organization .
We
shall pres
ently point out the practical signiﬁcance
of
this in selling
.
4 .
Our deﬁnition next describes an instinc
tive
act
as
o ne which
the
individual
may
perform without knowledge of the end .
For
example , when one turns pale in fear, he may
be aware of the fact , but may
not see any
good purpose in it .
In fact, he may regard
it as detrimental .
Now, though the end of
paling in fear may not be apparent there is
probably an
end there, or there has been at
some
time
in
man
’s
history .
It
probably
serves in some way to preserve life .
H ow
can paling be connected with the preservation
of life ?
Let
us
reason
it
o ut,
following
Darwin, on the basis of the distribution
of
the blood .
At time of fear, what is the politic
thing
to
do "
Run away .
But
to
run
re
quires
a
sudden access
of strength in
the
muscles of the legs .
To bring this strength ,
bloo d is needed there .
Nature provides for
this by withdrawing blood from portions of


1 46
THE
M IN D
OF THE
B U Y ER
possesses a feeling peculiarly its own—usually
called an emotion .
Consider,
for example ,
the instinctive act of running away from a
fearsome
object— and thi s includes
all
the
motions,
large and
small ,
that
aid
in
the
ﬂight : the locomotive actions
of the legs ; the
acceleration of the heart
-beat which pumps
more blood into the legs ; the quickened breath
ing
which
furnishes
more
oxygen
to
the
rapidly ﬂowing blood ; the actions of the in
ternal glands which pour strength
-giving sub
stances into the blood .
This mass of corre
lated
movement. that
we
call
the
instinct
pattern, ﬂight, is accompanied by the em!
tio nal cast of feeling which we call fear .
The
instinct
-pattern
that. we
call
pugnacity
is
accompanied by the emotional cast
o f feeling
which we call anger .
The instinctive action of
protecting one
’s young is accompanied by the
emotional feeling called parental love .
Thus
each great instinct
-pattern has its character
istic feeling .
Classiﬁcation
of instinctiv e
actions impracti
cable .
A t this point we should like to make a
list of the fundamental human instincts, but
we can hardly d o
so with conﬁdence .
There
are several reasons .
The
situations when in
stinctive actions are
evoked are
sometimes

INS TIN CTIVE FACTORS
1 47
complex,
so
that more than
o ne of the
in
stincts are called
o ut .
The resulting action
is a product
o f all ; hence we can hardly
secure
separate, clean
-cut patterns .
Further
more,
our instinctive actions become inter
penetrated , during the course of individual
experience,
with
acquired
acts,
especially
with habits .
Since we rarely see the pure
manifestations of instinctive action, then, we
cannot tell exactly h ow many instincts there
are .
Though we shall no t presume to give a com
pl ete list, we shall probably be safe in recog
nizing the
existence
of
some
of
the
great
classes denoted by current term s like self
preservation
( variously
called
locomotion ,
obtaining food, shelter, play, sleep ) ; repro
duction ; mating
( including acts of coyness
and
coquetry )
protection
of
the
young ;
ﬂight ; pugnacity ; repulsion .
Again ,
“ we may do best to make a general
classiﬁcation with reference
to the end that
the act subserves, rather than to the
speciﬁc
character of the particular instinct .
One of
the
most
convenient
divides
instincts
into
three classes :
( 1 )
those which preserve the
life and provide for the welfare of the
in
dividual
”
; such a s ﬂight, pugnacity, hoarding,

1 48
THE M IN D
OF THE
B U Y ER
curiosity .
Those which provide fo r the
continuance
o f the race and family
” ; such as,
mating,
protection
of home
and
of young .
Those which make fo r the welfare of the
tribe or social unit
”
; such as gregariousness,
imitation .
“ Some of the acts belong to more
than
o ne class— in fact, no one of the second
or third would be possible without the ﬁrst
—but the division is convenient in general
and may serve as a guide through the maze .
”
It s value in the
sale .
Out of this discussion
of the characteristics
of instinctive action ,
modiﬁed by the acknowledgment that adult
instinctive action is usually associated with
acquired
forms
of action,
the
reader
may
emerge with at least one clear idea , namely
that. the actions of a. buyer have two sources
individual experiences and racial experiences .
Though
the
two
are not separate in
their
effects upon human
conduct,
still
those
of
the second class are probably the ones upon
which the seller may depend more ﬁrmly in
moving the will of the buyer .
Their
superior
strength lies in the following facts :
R elatively more
certain .
Instinctive action,
being the imprint of thousands of experiences
upon thousands of ancestors, is ﬁrmly ﬁxed
within an individual ; hence, the appropriate


1 50

TH E BUYER
out into various tracts, representing
“idea
systems,
” while the ideas are being weighed
and balanced according
to the involved ,
in
tricate
procedure
outlined
in
Chapter
X .
After a long delay , lasting an hour, a day ,
week , month , or year, the action follows .
In
instinctive action , however, the pathways are
shorter and already marked
o ut .
When the
stimulus comes the act follows readily .
Instinctiv e action marked by feeling
.
The last
advantage lies in
the fact
. that instinctive
action is intimately connected, fairly suffused ,
with feeling .
Now
to feeling belong certain
possibilities for strengthening action which
are
no t attributive
to reason .
For example,
observe the way in which an evangelist. appeals
to his audience
to be convert ed .
When he
uses reason he ﬁnds his hearers respectful ( if
not somnolent) , but cold .
When he takes up
the wand
of feeling, however, he quickly se
cures results .
The seller wh o desires to
use
inﬂuential
methods of appeal
will learn a
lesson from successful evangelists .
For after
all , both preacher and seller have the same
problem
psychologically— to
induce
action .
And both need to use the same psychological
means in inducing it .

INSTINCTIVE FACTORS
1 51
In these last few pages we have
spoken
a s
though there might be
two kinds of action,
instinctive and
reasoned .
A s
a
matter of
fact, this is an artiﬁcial partition , justiﬁed
only by the necessities of literary exposition .
Actually a bit
. of human conduct may contain
at the same time both instinctive and rea
so ned factors .
The object. of
o ur comparison
has been to
show that probably a seller may
work more easily through
the former than
through the latter .
Summary

it resistant to satisfactory analysis
usually occurs in connection with
some
obscuring
and
complicating
acquired
action .
Also because it originated far back
in days before our ken , and is not always con
gruo us and understandable in its present
-day
setting
.
This very trait of inheritance , how
ever, endows it with value in the sale .
It is
thereby
ﬁrmly

universal
( present
within all members of the species)
prompt ;
and rich with the vivifying power of feeling .

CHAPTER
TWELVE
SU GGESTION IN
TH E SALE
Suggestion
is regarded
as mysterious. Much
has been said during recent years about the
psychology of suggestion and the possibility
of using it in selling
.
So much mysterious
potency has been claimed for it. that many
sellers believe
that they have only to learn
the laws of suggestion and
then they can
impose their will s unimpededly upon the help
less, submissive buying public .
This aura of mystery
surrounding
sugges
tion results from the dramatic instances which
have been recounted
showing
its power in
inﬂuencing human beings ; particularly in the
healing of disease .
People suffering or alleged
to
be
suffering from various diseases have
been treated by nothing but suggestion with
astonishing results .
Consequently the public
has concluded that there is some vital force
inherent in suggestion which can be employed
in all conditions of life .
Still further awe
is attached to it because of its close associa
152

this .
We simply use the methods already de
scribed in the chapter on attention ( Chapter
II )
.
The object thus forced into the mental
stream need not be physical .
It may be a
correspondence course in
Business English
that we are trying to sell , or a seat on the
Sto ck Exchange .
Whatever it
is we must
push it into the mental stream with as little
ado as possible .
There it ﬁnds elements
of
past
experience which
are
akin
to
‘it,
and
which
“ abso rb
” it , as related in
Chapter V .
The next event— the production of muscular
efforts—is more difﬁcult
to describe, and
to
achieve .
It is here that
. the greatest amount
o f mystery centers ; and here that the great
est amount
o f skill is demanded
of the seller .
How can a psychical thing like an idea change
over into physical energy and assume the form
of a motor act ?
And how
can
the seller
facilitate such transformation ?
The answer is contained partly in the law
of ideo
-motor action :
“An idea in the mind
tends
to
express itself in movement .
”
An
experiment
performed in
the psychological
laboratory
demonstrates
this
dramatically .
The experimenter fa stens a recording device
to the top
of a person
’s head so as to record
the slightest movement .
Then he asks the

SUGGESTION IN THE SALE
1 55
subject to think about a nearby object .
After
several moments the record shows that the
subject has begun to lean toward the object
about which he has been thinking .
We cannot enter into a discussion of the
brain mechanism by which this transforma
tion from idea to movement takes place .
It
is inherent in the a ssociation of brain path
ways already mentioned
o n page
45, where
we said that when an act has been performed
once, involving two or more pathways in the
brain , thereafter when the ﬁrst pathway ( the
idea pathway )
is aroused,
the second
( the
movement pathway ) follows .
If we examine closely our daily life we
may see numerous examples of ideo
-motor
action .
A housewife,
may be ﬁguring her
household
accounts,
directing
her
mental
stream urgently in one direction ; when
sud
denly a vague idea enters her mind that her
hair
needs
adjustment .
Automatically
her
hand moves up
to her head and tucks in a
hair
-pin .
She continues her work
uninter
ruptedly, and probably does not know that
she has made the movement .
In
this same
“ unconscious
way
we
all
perform scores of actions in the course of a
day .
We may possibly thus make some unim

1 56
THE MIND OF
TH E BUYER
portant purchases .
For example,
the idea
“ base
-ball score
” may enter our mind as we
leave the ofﬁce at ﬁve in the afternoon, and
may be strong enough in its own right
to
lead us without further locution of thought
to reach into our pocket for a coin and buy
a paper .
These illustrations show
that
there is a
real motive power resident within an idea .
If this is the case , why is it that a seller
may inject an idea into the mind of the buyer
and still not produce the desired response ?
The answer is that the idea may be pre
vented from achieving its motor consequences
by
the
presence
of
another
idea .
As
we
showed on page
38 there are always many
things in the mind
-
sensations,
ideas, feel
ings, in great profusion .
Now each of these
has its own motor consequences, and if left
alone will
probably produce them .
Mixed
as it is, however, with others, all struggling
fo r expression, it can only express itself as
modiﬁed by the others .
Some of them help
it and some hinder it .
The task of the seller
is to encourage those ideas which are favor
able to his pet
-idea and
to
suppress those
which are contrary
to it .
In accomplishing
this there are several laws to be observed :


1 58
TH E M IND OF
TH E BUYER
withsta nd every contradictory impul se .
Make
the
suggested
course
o f action
appear
in
evitable .
3 .
The inevitableness may be enhanced by
another important law :
Make the
suggestion
simple .
If yo u wish to arouse an action, sug
gest only that one .
In writing an advertise
ment, for example, it is a violation of this
F IG . 9 .
principle to suggest :
( 1 ) Ask your dealer
for it ; ( 2 )
o r if he does
no t have it send
us
his name ;
( 3)
or send us ﬁfty cents for a
sample package .
”
Such alternative directions
are psychologically faulty .
For each of the
three ideas arouses
some ideo
-motor activity
which is immediately obstructed by that which
follows .
The
situation may be represented
by Figure
9 ; where the ﬁrst idea arouses a
motor impulse over pathway abc
then comes

SUGGESTION IN THE SALE
1 59
the second idea sending forth the motor im
pulse abd
then comes the third idea starting
up motor impulse abe .
By this time the pre
cio us nervous energy that was available for
the action is exhausted and dissipated , and it
starts up no action at all .
The correction for
such a situation is to make only o ne suggestion
at a time .
4 .
Make p o sitive suggestions .
A negative
suggestion is one containing
“ no
or
“ no t
”
and should be avoided .
Violations of this law
are exceedingly numerous in selling, pa rticu
l arly in the manufacture of business
slogans .
“ Don
’t say
say
is a favorite form .
Accept no substitute,
is another .
The psychological offense in negative sug
gestion
is
that the real motive force of a
phrase lies in the idea of the action, not in
the way the action is modiﬁed verbally .
In
the slogan
“Accept
no substitute,
”
the
real
idea is
“Accept substitute .
”
To
negate
it
does not materially weaken its force .
The
phrase really suggests
to the buyer that he
should
‘accept
a substitute .
A very little analysis of selling phrases
from this point of view will show that many
o f them do no t put into the mind of the buyer
the idea intended by the seller .
Let us, by

1 60
THE MIND OF THE BUYER
way
of
illustration ,
analyze
a
well -known
selling
-phrase which may lead the mind far
aﬁeld from the direction desired by the seller
:
“ Eventually, why
no t now ?”
The adverb
“ eventually
” implies a verb and
subject ; in all likelihood :
“ You will use Gold
Medal Flour .
”
This part of the phrase is not
wholly reprehensible ; yet
it has
o ne faulty
implication , namely, that the buyer is prob
ably going to delay the act of purchase .
It is
as if one said to the housewife :
“ I know you
are using
some other ﬂour
now .
K eep on
using it ; after trial you will change to another
brand ; after it to another .
Eventually , how
ever ( after perhaps twenty years ) , you will
come to ours .
”
Upon such analysis, which is
surely not far
-fetched, the ﬁrst part of the
slogan is seen
to
contain implications that
were surely never intended by the seller, con
ﬁrming the housewife in her present
use of
another ﬂour .
The second part of the slogan is open to
still more serious
objection .
If we follow
the subterranean conversation between seller
and buyer, we shall ﬁnd that the seller says
by implication
:
“ I know you are
not going
to buy now .
”
The buyer replies,
“ No !
I am
not .
”
The seller asks,
“ Why not ? ”
What


1 62
THE MIND OF THE BUYER
fountain clerk,
“ Give me a
glass of coke .
The manufacturers did not like this ; for it
permitted the clerk to
substitute some imita
tion
of
Coca
Cola which
might call itself
coke .
”
Furthermore
the
abbreviation
is
reminiscent
of
an
undesirable
drug
habit .
How break the public of the habit of using the
obnoxious appelation ?
To advertise,
“ Don
’t
say coke,
” would be to give
a negative sug
gestion , entailing all the
undesirable couse
q uences mentioned above, namely, by repeti
tion
o f the name
“ coke
” the people who used
it would be tempted to use it all the more ;
some who might never have used it might get
the habit ; and worse, the real idea conveyed
would be
“ Say Coke ,
” despite the negation .
As a solution
to this
q uandry, the manu
fa cturers adopted the phrase,
“ A skfor Coca
Cola by its full name .
”
This suggestion
is
free from obj ections .
It conveys the desired
meaning ; it is positive ; and if people follow
it they will be doing what the company de
sires .
This illustration
shows that no matter
how strong the temptation
to
use negative
suggestion, if the
seller studies
his situation
carefullyand takes sufﬁcient thought, he will
be able to avoid the enervating and mislead

SUGGE STION IN THE SALE
1 63
ing negative and express
his suggestions in
the positive form .
The above discussion suggests another fact
about suggestion :
The ideas involved in a
suggestion, especially in an indirect
sugges
tion, are of two kinds .
Some are on the
sur
face, explicit ; others are hidden , implicit .
In
the
suggestion ,
“ Ask the man who owns one ,
”
the implied portions are,
“ If
yo u want
to
know how our car satisﬁes
” ! a skthe man wh o
owns one! ;
“ He will tell
yo u that it gives
perfect satisfaction .
”
The reader will ﬁnd
interesting
exercise
in
thus
analyzing
the
many
suggestion
-slogans
before
the
public ,
and will derive much beneﬁt therefrom in the
task of strengthening the force of his own
selling suggestions .
5 .
The recognition of the explicit
-implicit
nature of suggestion leads
to the considera
tion of another law :
Normally an indirect
suggestion is more effective than a direct
o ne .
IVe might paraphrase a deﬁnition of direct
suggestion by stating that it is a suggestion
in which you say what you mean ; an indirect
one is one in which you say one thing and
mean
something else
N o t
necessarily the
opposite .
The distinction
is rather that in
indirect
suggestion one says part of what one

1 64
THE MIND OF THE BUYER
means, then leaves the other person to com
pl ete the meaning .
We might illustrate as
follows
:
Direct
suggestion :
“Use
Prince
Albert Tobacco .
”
Indirect
'
“ Ty Cobb Uses
Prince Albert Tobacco .
”
We may pictu re
the effect
of these upon the mind of the buyer
by
employing
the
ﬁlling
-in method
of our
last illustration .
There is little
to
supply
in the direct form .
Everything is said .
In
the indirect form , however, there is much to
supply .
All that is said explicitly is that
“ Ty
Cobb smokes Prince Albert Tobacco .
”
Im
plicitly, however, a good deal is
, said .
The
argument runs as follows
:
“ Ty Cobb
smokes
Prince Albert ; he must like it .
He is a man
of good judgment ( in baseball )
.
The chances
are that he is also a good judge of tobacco .
Therefore
Prince
Albert
must
be
a
good
tobacco .
I
’ll smoke it .
”
It is evident that
. there
is room
fo r con
siderabl e illogicality in indirect suggestion .
As indicated in the parenthesis above, in order
fo r the thought to ﬂow along smoothly in the
channel desired by the seller, certain assump
tions must ordinarily be made .
The
assump
tion in the present instance is that the famous
ball player is as good a judge of tobacco as he


1 66
THE MIND OF THE BUYER
psychological analysis like the above would
soon give
a basis fo r voting them fraudulent
and deceptive .
D irect
v s. indirect
suggestion .
In asserting
o n page 1 63 that indirect suggestion is
no r
mally more powerful than direct suggestion
we did not mean to condemn the latter
en
tirely
.
Direct suggestion has certain weight .
Probably it is most useful with people who
“ don
’t know their
own minds .
”
There are
undoubtedly individuals who like to have their
decisions made for them , and
who welcome
unconsciously a direct suggestion, indeed, a
command .
P sychologists
wh o
have
ex peri
mented in this ﬁeld, however, assert that even
with such individuals, the desired
a ct may
’ be
instigated by means of indirect suggestion .
F o r example, when the time comes for closing
the sale, the salesman may suggest indirectly
that the customer has already made his de
cisio n, by starting to wrap up the article or
by asking,
“ Do you wish it delivered to

The great advantage claimed for the
in
direct mode of appeal is that it does not have
such
a tendency to

do know their
own minds, and desire to feel
that they are masters
of their fate .
Counter-suggestion .
Thus far in our discus

SUGGESTION IN THE SALE
1 67
sion we have mentioned several kinds of sug
gestion : abnormal , normal , positive , negative ,
direct, indirect .
There are two other kinds
which
belong
in
any
thoroughgoing
treat
ment of the subject .
The ﬁrst is counter
-sug
gestion .
In this the individual making the
suggestion has one desired act in mind but
suggests the performance
of its
direct
op
po site .
A type of mind has been discovered
which reacts oppositely
to every suggestion .
“ Cranky
”
husbands
sometimes
exhibit
this
tendency ; and their wives move them by
sug
gesting the opposite .
Obviously a seller does
not meet with this type very frequently, but
when he does, he may use counter
-suggestion
with success .
Auto
- suggestion .
The last kind
.
of
sugges
tion we shall consider is auto
-suggestion .
This
is, as the name implies, self
-suggestion .
The
seller does not use it upon the buyer but
upon himself .
A salesman has great need of
having certain ideas injected into his mental
stream .
He is ready prey
to
thoughts of
failure, discouragement and weakness .
Let
him study the effect of suggestion in general
and remember what a strength there is in
ideas .
He may be cheered by the fact that
he is j ust
as certainly
susceptible to the in

1 68
THE MIND OF
TH E BUYER
ﬂuence of suggestions as is the buyer.
Co n
sequently if he wishes to perform a certain
act, let him put into his own mind the idea
of the act, following the laws of suggestion
laid down in the foregoing .
Almost every
successful salesman could give startling proof
of the power of auto
-suggestion in his own
life .
In making use of it he avoids negative
suggestion by banishing from his mind and
conversation
all
thoughts
of
failure .
He
nerves himself for an important interview by
positive suggestions such
as,
“ I will win .
He employs direct
suggestion by asserting,
“ My goods come up to every claim I make for
them
”
He
gi ves himself indirect auto
-sug
gestions by straightening his spine,
squaring
his
shoulders,
and
whistling— all
signs
of
strength and courage .
In brief one
of the
most important lessons the seller may take
away from this chapter is the thought that
suggestion will operate upon himself as well
as upon the buyer.

No kind of
affairs appears too sacred and no kind to o pro
fane to be exempted from the
“ p sychological

As evidence of the aptness of the
term to cover a mul titude of situations we ﬁnd
it applied to affairs in which there is no psychi
cal factor whatever,
such as a rain
so timed
as to save a corn crop or to the eruption of a
geyser .
From these instances we
see that the term
is a very useful one, playing a large part in
the speech and thought of the day .
True, it
smacks somewhat of esotericism , but such
co n
notation is belied by the fact that it is em
ployed with equal glibness by the savant and
the man

Y o u
see that two
armies
a re two bodies which meet
and
endeavor to frighten
each other ;
a moment of p anic occurs,
and that moment must
be turned to
advantage .
When
a man ha s b een present in
many
actions
he distinguishes that moment without dith
culty ; it is
a s
easy
as ca sting up
a n
addition.
The matter is
not so simple as these lines
imply,
as any salesman will testify .
It is
rather
a
matter
for
serious
psychological
analysis .
In
making such
analysis
of the
salesman
’s moment we must regard the sal e,
following
the pattern used throughout this
boo k, as a series
of mental changes on
th e
part of the buyer, leading to an
act of will
which culminates in satisfaction .
A n idea precedes.
An idea must precede de
cisio n and action in the sale .
We have said
this in many ways throughout the preceding
chapters of this book .
And we have shown
that the seller is not
so much a distributor
of goods as he is a manipulator of ideas .
In
order to bring out a new phase of this thought
we shall
fo r the rhetorical purposes
of this
chapter, personify the Idea and speak of it in
capitals ; though the reader is warned that such
practice is strictly frowned upon in orthodox

1 72
THE MIND OF THE BUYER
psychological
circles .
We
shall
take
this
liberty, however, for in these days when the
psychological aspect
of business operations
is
only
dimly
recognized
we
should
be
pardoned
if
we
state
things
with
slightly
bizarre effect in our efforts to show their im
portance .
But apart
from
such
claims
to
anthropomorphism ,
the
Idea
is
important
enough on other grounds to deserve capitaliza
tion ,
fo r sometimes It is able to set
off our
actions
almost
automatically .
Through
a
kind of action technically known as
“ dynamo
genesis
” ( see page
It occasionally may
pa ss over into action immediately and result
in a sale .
For example, the Idea ,
“baseball
score
” may be strong enough in its own right
to lead one without further deliberation to
reach into the pocket for a coin and buy a
paper .
Such a purchase is
so shorn of vol un
tary characteristics as no t to furnish us with
an illustration of the psychological moment .
But not all sales are
o f this
“ hair
-trigger
”
type, and most Ideas even though carefully
implanted in the mind do not lead directly to
purchase, but require manipulation .
Indeed,
such
is
the
case with
all
o ur
deliberative
sales .
An analysis of the fortunes of the Idea,


1 74
THE MIND OF THE BUYER
would
resemble
a
full
-moon
containing
a
central circle, freckled with numerous circlets
of different sizes representing the ideas with
their different strengths .
It will be seen that
these ideas bear different relationships to the
central idea ,
some being hostile, others sym
pathetic .
Whether they hinder
o r help they
must be reckoned with and must be manipu
lated to the glory
of the Idea , which must be
nourished and expanded to such a degree that
its bulk will crowd out all the other ideas .
This
task
of
nourishment
confronts
every
salesman ;
indeed ,
from
the
psychological
standpoint the
salesman is not a vender of
automobiles but a manipulator of ideas .
His
task is to fan the ﬂame of the Idea until it
becomes to the buyer the consuming interest
in life .
Beside It, everything must
shrink to
nothingness— the
about
-to
-b e
-ravaged
bank
account, the heart
-rending burden of upkeep,
the mortgage on the house , last year
’s unpaid
coal
-bill —all must be forgotten in the over
powering compulsion of the Idea .
And the
Idea must remain the
greatest thing in the
world long enough for the purchaser to sign
his check or sign th e pay
-as
-you
-use contract .
To a superﬁcial view the task of the sales
man might seem to be that of taking hold of

THE PSYCHOLOGICAL MOMENT
1 75
these unwelcome ideas
and thrusting them
into outer darkness, but such a conception is
erroneous and will lead
to egregious error .
If the mind of the buyer contains the idea of
another car the proper procedure is not to
dilate negatively upon that car in the
eﬁo rt
to drive it out
of his mind .
Every word
ut
tered about that car acts as food for the
un
welcome idea and causes it to wax stronger
and stronger .
The practice of criticizing or
condemning a rival commodity is being recog
nized as poor business ethics, but we may
go
still farther and say that to speak either
in praise or blame
of ri val goods is poor psy
ch ol ogy, for every word makes the undesired
idea still more troublesome .
What are the methods, then , by which the
undesirable ideas may be forced out of the
mind and the desired One
enchanced ?
The
answer is
to force attention upon It ; when
this happens, the strength
of the undesired
ideas automatically decreases .
The psycho
logical situation may become clearer when
described
in
terms
of
brain
energy .
The
brain,
according
to
some
psychologists,
is
organized into a number of ideational systems ,
o ne for each idea that exists in the mind .
Any
ideational system may be roused into action

1 76
THE MIND OF THE BUYER
by the drainage into it of brain energy .
Now
the energy of the brain may be distributed
in various amounts
over
different systems,
the amount in each
system depending upon
the strength
o f the corresponding idea .
In
the case of our sale , if the main Idea is to
grow in strength Its brain
-system must draw
off from the other systems the brain energy
resident within them until the energy of the
brain is all drained
off into the one system,
which means the triumph of the Idea .
Reverting to our psychological description
of the sale, we might
. pause at this stage and
elaborate upon methods of strengthening the
Idea ,
but
that
would
require
a
digression
from
o ur
main
interest—the
psychological
moment .
Suffice it to say, the process consists
in using concrete material with which to em
bellish the Idea .
The salesman must dilate
upon the
speciﬁc virtues of the car, upon the
power
and
smoothness
of
the
engine,
the
luxurious ease
o f the springs, the elegance of
the
upholstery .
Then
he
must
attach
a s
allies to the Idea , the subsidiary ideas that
lurk sympathetically in the background of
the mind of the buyer, showing how the car
may be used to transport oneself and family
to sylvan spots, how it may assist
o ne to radi

THE MIND OF THE BUYER
a baby
’s cry, an accident in the street .
Any
thing, however unrelated
to the commodity
may spoil the sale .
Any salesman can de
scribe
a
score
of
such
catastrophes
which
make him assert that the psychological mo
ment is the most critical stage in the
sale .
And he does not overstate the fact .
The ex
perience of sales managers goes to show that
the salesmen who fail are deﬁcient most fre
quently in ability to get past the psychological
moment .
They make a good approa ch , arouse
interest in the goods and create strong desire ,
but are unable to make a good closing .
They
err in two ways—in trying to force a decision
to o
soo n,
before the Idea has had time
to
reach Its maximum dimensions, or in delay
ing to press fo r a decision until after the Idea
has
ripened
and
decayed .
In
either
case,
their error lies in
a fail ure to recognize the
psychological moment .
H ow
recognize it ?
H ow may one recognize
the psychological moment and how may one
cultivate
a
sensitiveness
for
its
approach ?
Undoubtedly there are signs that accompany
it, for successful salesmen sense it readily .
Their
awareness
of
it,
however,
is
not
a
vividly self
-conscious matter, for they cannot
tell how they
recognize it .
If pressed for
a

THE PSYCHOLOGICAL MOMENT
1 79
description
of their method, they would prob
ably
say, by intuition, and this may serve
as
well as any other word .
But the process
of
intuition
may
be
further
analyzed
into
a
process
of
conscious
apprehension
through
sense avenues which we all possess .
Many of
the things that warn of the approach
of the
moment in the sale
are
smal l
involuntary
movements on the part
of the buyer, such
as
slight inclinations
of
the
head and trunk,
minute contractions and relaxations of bodily
muscles .
Even
so slight
a change as that in
the size
of the pupil of the eye may
serve to
indicate
to the practiced salesman that
the
portentous moment has arrived .
Other more
obvious signs may consist of verbal responses
of the buyer, for the
skillful salesman does
not do all the talking in engineering a
sale ;
instead he throws out frequent feelers in the
form of questions, and by the warmth of the
response,
can judge how nearly
a
decision
has been reached .
A hundred cues such as
these are present and are automatically used
by the expert salesman in identifying the psy
chol ogical moment .
H ow meet it ?
Upon recognizing the moment
what steps may the salesman take to
see that
it is passed most auspiciously ?
Our psycho

1 80
THE MIND OF
TH E BUYER
logical analysis just completed will suggest
measures .
Stage the sale
so that there will
be
no disturbances while it is in progress ;
for any disturbance, no matter how trivial ,
may mean the introduction of a new idea into
the mind of the buyer and a dislodgment of
the balance of brain energy .
In view of such
danger, the salesman should carefully isolate
the buyer and separate him from things and
people .
This is the great psychological
ad
vantage
of using a show room .
Another prophylactic measure is
to have
conditions favorable for the immediate con
summation
o f the sale .
As we pointed
o ut
on page 1 77 there should be
no awkward de
lay when the moment arrives .
The contract
should be ready and the writing utensils at
hand .
All
shoul d move as
smoothly as
a
theatrical
performance
Indeed,
a
sale
in
many ways resembles a drama and may be
rehearsed with equal propriety .
As a third way of meeting the moment, the
following plan may
be recommended :
As
sume that the sale is made— that the pur
chaser has decided to buy— and this will be
true if the salesman has judged the moment
rightly .
Then ask,
“ What color of upholstery
do you prefer ? ” or,

and when he

If it was satisfactory

Again , the buyer carries about with him the

Evidences
of
new ideals in trade.
That the
best of modern
sellers
are
recognizing the
truth of our doctrine that satisfaction is the
true goal
of the
sale,
is being evinced in
several ways .
During the past
two decades
numerous symptoms have appeared : changes
in methods of publicity ;
of approach
to the
customer ; Of post
-sale tactics ;
of policies ; of
ideals—changes
in
the
very
philosophy
of
trade .

SATISFACTION TH E GOAL
1 87
In proceeding to limn these changes we do
no t mean to imply that they have taken place
suddenly .
They
have
gradually
evolved .
Moreover they are not yet completely realized ;
they are still evolving .
The things we shall
undertake
to describe are merely trends,
in
dicating
the
direction
of
the
evolution .
Speaking statistically, we mean that the prae
tices and ideals to be mentioned are becoming
more common than formerly .
Some
of
these
changes
have
signiﬁcant
ethical consequenc es portending progress
to
ward certain moral
goals that society hopes
to reach .
There are important economic con
sequences involved , al so, which are of great
interest .
We shall not attempt to trace these
out, however, being content for the present
merely to point out the changes in styles and
fashions
of
selling
.
We shall
Show
that
whereas
certain
practices
and
ideals
were
prevalent a score of years ago , others are now
coming into vogue .
N ew conception of value.
The ﬁrst change we
shall note is a new attitude on the part of
the
seller
toward
value .
In
the
previous
period it was customary to give the buyer as
little
as
possible
for
his
money .
In
the
modern period the ideal
is to give as much

1 88
THE MIND OF THE BUYER
as possible .
Perhaps the clamorous cri es of
“ proﬁteer
”
now
( 1 920)
ﬁl ling the air tem
po rarily prevent
us from sensing this more
merciful tendency of the seller.
Nevertheless
if we can disregard
o ur momentary irritation
over the high cost Of living we must recognize
the general improvement in conditions .
An objector might question this
statement
o n the ground that it implies abrogation or
suspension
of the economic law of competi
tion in which
seller and buyer struggle for
advantage .
In
rejoinder,
we
might
reply
that there is a growing tendency for the seller
to
identify his interests with
those
of the
buyer .
He
is coming to
see that whatever
beneﬁts the buyer may in turn beneﬁt himself .
We shall develop this further in another con
nectio n .
F o r the present it is sufﬁcient
to
point o ut that this lessens ( though it does no t
entirely eliminate )
the antagonism between
seller and buyer .
Second, it may be that com
petition
is
growing
stronger
among
the
various venders
of a
given
commodity ;
a s
competitors become more numerous each
o ne
is obliged to shade prices as low as possible
in
sheer
self
-defense .
Third,
the
seller is
enabled
to carry
out the ideal stated above

of the new order consist in the practice of
stamping the price of shoes on the sole ; the
publishing of standard prices for hats, tires,
and the like ; the agitation fo r legi slation

quiri ng

manufacturer
’s
price
to
be
stamped upon the goods before they reach the
retail market .
2 .
Another form of subjectivism in the Old
regime was the amount of entertaining and
subsidizing that the seller carried on .
He
was expected to treat the buyer with cigars,
wines, dinner and theater.
TO one acquainted
with
modern
selling
practices
no
proof
is
needed
o f
the obsolescence
of this custom .
One characteristic feature of the new era is
the rise
o f the professional purchasing
-agent
who owes his j ob
to the skill with which he
can keep himself clear of entangling alliances
and can buy in the open market with
Oh
j ectively demonstrable advantage .
3 .
Other evidences
of the growing tend
ency toward
Objectivism may be discovered
by comparing the tactics
of salesmanship em
ployed during the two eras .
The differences
in advertising are
strikingly brought out in
these two advertisements .
The ﬁrst appeared

The measurement
of truthfulness in
advertis
ing
.
Advertisers assert that they are growing
more truthful .
Proceeding upon the general
hypothesis
that
whatever
exists
may
be
measured, and that if truthfulness in
adver
tising is on the increase we ought to be able
to demonstrate
the fact mathematically, the
author set out to devise a method .
It was ﬁrst necessary to adopt a criterion
of truthfulness which might be stated in units
of amount .
F o r this was chosen the use of
words in the superlative degree .
Terms like
“ best,
”
“latest ,
”
“ ﬁnest,
”
“ perfect,
”
“ abso
l utely unsurpassed,
” have been used much in
advertising, and are frowned upon as viola

1 92
THE MIND OF THE BUYER
tions
of veracity .
For certainly
no t every
brand
of breakfast food,
dyspepsia
tablets,
automobil e tires and ﬂour can be the best .
If the superlative be adopted as a fairly
satisfactory
criteri on
of
truthfulness,
o r
rather untruthfulness,
o ur task of measure
ment is quite
simple, requiring us merely to
count the advertisements containing
superl a
tives and compare the number with the to tal
number of advertisements appearing .
This
the
author
did,
using
the
ﬁles
of
three
mediums covering the peri od 1 9 00
-1 9 1 9 : The
I ndianapolis N ews, a typical newspaper ; The
Co smop o litan,
a
typical
general
magazine ;
and H o us e B ea utiful, a typical home maga
zine .
N o classiﬁed advertisements were used .
Results are presented in Figure 1 0
.
From these results we may conclude that
untruthfulness in advertising as represented
by
the
use
of
superlatives
is
decreasing.
Whereas in 1 9 00 the percentage
of advertise:
ments
containing
superlatives
was
twenty ;
by
1 9 1 9 it had decreased
to
two .
In terms
of probability we might assert that whereas
twenty years
ago
the chances that an
ad
vertiser was telling an untruth were twenty
in
a hundred, to day they
are but two in
a


1 94
THE MIND OF THE BUYER
hundred .
We may accept these amounts with
considerable c onﬁdence because they appear
in all three of the diverse mediums examined .
The graph shows that the greatest regular
ity in the decline
o f untruthfulness
comes
after
1 9 1 2 .
This is approximately the date
of the adoption of the motto, Truth , by the
Associated Advertising
Clubs
o f the World .
Previous to this had come the Congressional
pure food and drug laws of 1 906 .
F o r some
years thereafter advertisers were
no t certain
how far they might go in their descriptions .
As the curves show , they oscillated back and
forth between superlatives and weaker state
ments .
By
1 9 1 2 , however,
they either had
come
to take the spirit of the law more
se
rio usly or had become more
scrupul ous, or
had discovered that truthful advertising pays .
Probably
under
the
inﬂuence
of
all
these
causes they
settled down to a growing regard
for the truth , reducing the ratio of
ex aggera
tion rapidly to two per cent .
The author does not advocate the use of the
superlative as an absolute test of truthfulness
in adverti sing .
At best it can serve as only
one measure .
Other measures may
unques
tio nably be unearthed with
industrious
re
search
.
Nevertheless this meth od has given

SATISFACTION THE GOAL
1 95
such clean
-cut results that it deserves serious
consideration
in
relation
to
the important
question of truth in advertising .
It may be
used to measure the differences in truthfulness
between mediums ; to aid the Vigilance Com
mittee of the A . A . C . W . in securing objective
basis for the annual award of the Truth Tro
phy ; and
to assist the Better Business
B u
reaus in measuri ng the results of their eﬁo rts
to police and to educate their communities .
Surely
these
tentative
results
give
us
ground for hopefully continuing such investi
gatio ns, and anticipating the time when we
may
set up deﬁnite ethical standards for the
advertiser and help him to measure his prog
ress toward his. goal . 1

have treated them as distinct trends, we must
recognize that they are not entirely independ
ent of each other .
For instance, in admitting
that a true sale must give satisfaction to the
buyer we rec ognize the continuity of the sale .
TO
say that one
sell s
service is to admit the
truth of th e other propositions .
We
should not make the mistake of assum
ing that these ideals are completely realized o r
universally adopted .
Still they indicate the
direction of the main current
Of thought and
practice, and to a shrewd observer, they pre
sage the nature
of the developments that are
likely to come in the future .
Summary
.
In this chapter we have
advo
cated the adoption
o f
- the view that the real
end o f the sale is the satisfaction of the buyer.
As one line of evidence we have pointed to the
growing use o f satisfying practices o n the part
of progressive
sellers .
We might talk about these improved ideals
and practices in ethical terms and say that
clearly sellers are becoming converted
to a
higher standard of ethics and are for
this
r ea so n making the changes noted .
Though
the ethical ideals
of trade have been growing
more elevated , we should probably be in error
to ascribe them as the cause of the reforms we

SATISFACTION THE GOAL
1 99
have noted .
Ethical formulations constitute
euphonious terms in which
to describe
o ur
actions .
To be really truthful we
should say
that these practices have been accepted
be
cause they have paid economically .
Sellers
have discovered that it p ays to give ﬁrst con
sideration to the welfare of the buyer .
That
they have made this discovery only lately is
due to the fact that
. they have just begun to
learn
how
to
use the methods of science in
measuring the success of their various tactics .
The ethical uplifter might take a hint from
this and conclude that if he wishes to see high
ethical ideals advance in business he should
teach the seller how to
use scientiﬁc methods
in measuring the results
Of
“ good
” and
“bad
”
selling methods .
If these practices can be justiﬁed ethically
and economically they can probably be justi
ﬁed psychologically .
And it is this j ustiﬁca
tion that we have tried to furnish throughout
this book .
If our message is rightly under
stood the reader will lay down the boo k with
the conviction that
the
satisfaction of
"the
buyer is the keystone that supports the arch
o f the sale .
Though a
seller may study psy
chol ogy assiduously ; learn
all
the laws
of
memory, reasoning, suggestion ; apply all the

200
THE MIND OF THE BUYER
formulas for arousing intere :t, desire and con
ﬁdence ; and fail to keep
a s his goal the wel
fare
of the buyer, his words will be as sound
ing brass and tinkling cymbal .
And though
he may go far toward
success by applying the
subtleties of psychological lore, he will go still
farther if he places one rule before all others
—the old
-fashioned unselﬁsh doctrine
embod
ied in the Golden R ule.
