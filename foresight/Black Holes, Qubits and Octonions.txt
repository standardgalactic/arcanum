Abstract
We review the recently established relationships between black hole entropy in string theory and the
quantum entanglement of qubits and qutrits in quantum information theory. The ﬁrst example is provided
by the measure of the tripartite entanglement of three qubits (Alice, Bob and Charlie), known as the 3-
tangle, and the entropy of the 8-charge STU black hole of N = 2 supergravity, both of which are given
by the [SL(2)]3 invariant hyperdeterminant, a quantity ﬁrst introduced by Cayley in 1845. Moreover the
classiﬁcation of three-qubit entanglements is related to the classiﬁcation of N = 2 supersymmetric STU
black holes. There are further relationships between the attractor mechanism and local distillation protocols
and between supersymmetry and the suppression of bit ﬂip errors. At the microscopic level, the black holes
are described by intersecting D3-branes whose wrapping around the six compact dimensions T 6 provides
the string-theoretic interpretation of the charges and we associate the three-qubit basis vectors, |ABC⟩
(A, B, C = 0 or 1), with the corresponding 8 wrapping cycles. The black hole/qubit correspondence extends
to the 56 charge N = 8 black holes and the tripartite entanglement of seven qubits where the measure is
provided by Cartan’s E7 ⊃[SL(2)]7 invariant. The qubits are naturally described by the seven vertices
ABCDEFG of the Fano plane, which provides the multiplication table of the seven imaginary octonions,
reﬂecting the fact that E7 has a natural structure of an O-graded algebra. This in turn provides a novel
imaginary octonionic interpretation of the 56 = 7 × 8 charges of N = 8: the 24 = 3 × 8 NS-NS charges
correspond to the three imaginary quaternions and the 32 = 4×8 R-R to the four complementary imaginary
octonions. We contrast this approach with that based on Jordan algebras and the Freudenthal triple system.
N = 8 black holes (or black strings) in ﬁve dimensions are also related to the bipartite entanglement of three
qutrits (3-state systems), where the analogous measure is Cartan’s E6 ⊃[SL(3)]3 invariant. Similar analogies
exist for magic N = 2 supergravity black holes in both four and ﬁve dimensions. Despite the ubiquity
of octonions, our analogy between black holes and quantum information theory is based on conventional
quantum mechanics but for completeness we also provide a more exotic one based on octonionic quantum
mechanics. Finally, we note some intriguing, but still mysterious, assignments of entanglements to cosets,
such as the 4-way entanglement of eight qubits to E8/[SL(2)]8.

1. INTRODUCTION
1.1. Overview
It sometimes happens that two very diﬀerent areas of theoretical physics share the same mathematics.
This may eventually lead to the realisation that they are, in fact, dual descriptions of the same physical
phenomena, or it may not. Either way, it frequently leads to new insights in both areas. In this Review,
the two areas in question are black hole entropy in string theory and qubit entanglement in quantum infor-
mation theory. Quantum entanglement lies at the heart of quantum information theory, with applications
to quantum computing, teleportation, cryptography and communication. In the apparently separate world
of quantum gravity, the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy [1, 2] of black holes has also occupied centre stage.
Despite their apparent diﬀerences, recent work [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17] has demon-
strated a correspondence between the two. Although we still do not know whether there are any physical
reasons underlying these mathematical coincidences, there is now a growing dictionary, which translates a
variety of phenomena in one language to those in the other. For example:
Qubits and D = 4 black holes
1. The measure of tripartite entanglement of three qubits (Alice, Bob and Charlie), known as the
(unnormalised) 3-tangle τABC [18], and the entropy S of the 8-charge STU black hole of super-
gravity [19, 20, 15] are related by [3]
S = π
2
√τABC
(1.1)
where τABC is given by the hyperdeterminant [21], a quantity ﬁrst introduced by Cayley in 1845
[22].
2. The classiﬁcation of three-qubit entanglements is related to the classiﬁcation of N = 2 super-
symmetric STU black holes [4] shown in Table 1 and explained in more detail in section 7.3.

Table 1: The values of the local entropies SA, SB, and SC and the hyperdeterminant Det a (deﬁned in section 4.3.3 and
section 4.3.2) are used to partition three-qubit states into entanglement classes. The entropy/entanglement correspondence
relates these to D = 4, N = 2, STU model black holes (see section 6).
Speciﬁcally, the to absence/presence of a horizon
(small/large) and the extent of supersymmetry.
3. The attractor mechanism on the black hole side is related to optimal local distillation protocols
on the QI side. Moreover, supersymmetric and non-supersymmetric black holes correspond to the
suppression or non-suppression of bit ﬂip errors [9].
4. There is also a quantum information theoretic interpretation of the 56 charge N = 8 black hole in
terms of a Hilbert space consisting of seven copies of the three-qubit Hilbert space [6, 7]. It relies
on the decomposition E7(7) ⊃[SL(2)]7 and admits the interpretation, via the Fano plane [23],
of a tripartite entanglement of seven qubits1 with the entanglement measure given by Cartan’s
quartic E7(7) invariant.
1As explained in section 8.8, our terminology tripartite entanglement of seven qubits diﬀers from that used in some of the
QI literature.

Table 2: As in Table 1 entanglement measures are used to classify states, but this time concerning the tripartite entanglement
of seven qubit states. The correspondence relates these to the D = 4, N = 8 black holes discussed in section 8.1.
5. The classiﬁcation of tripartite entanglements of seven qubits is related to the classiﬁcation of
(N = 8, D = 4) supersymmetric black holes [11] shown in Table 2 and explained in more detail
in section 8.7.
6. Since the Fano plane provides the multiplication table of the octonions, this means that the
octonions (often written oﬀas a lost cause in physics [24, 25]) may actually be testable in the
laboratory.
7. There are similar correspondences with the black holes of the N = 2 magic supergravities in
D = 4 [26].
8. Turning to the microscopic interpretation of black hole entropy in Type IIB string theory, one can
consider conﬁgurations of intersecting D3-branes, whose wrapping around the six compact dimen-
sions T 6 provides the microscopic string-theoretic interpretation of the charges. The three-qubit
basis vectors |ABC⟩, (A, B, C = 0 or 1) are associated with the corresponding 8 wrapping cycles,
where |0⟩corresponds to xo and |1⟩to ox in Table 35. Performing a T-duality transformation,
one obtains a Type IIA interpretation with N0 D0-branes, N1, N2, N3 D4-branes plus eﬀective
D2-brane charges, where |0⟩now corresponds to xx and |1⟩to oo.
9. In particular, one can relate a well-known fact of quantum information theory, that the most
general real three-qubit state can be parameterised by four real numbers and an angle, to a well-
known fact of string theory, that the most general STU black hole can be described by four
D3-branes intersecting at an angle.
Qutrits and D = 5 black holes
1. The measure of the bipartite entanglement of two qutrits [26], known as the 2-tangle τAB, is also
related to the entropy of the 9-charge black hole of D = 5 supergravity.
S = 2π
p
| det aAB|,
(1.2)
where
τAB = 27| det aAB|2.
(1.3)
This corresponds to the N = 8 black hole with just 9 of the 27 charges switched on.
2. There is also a quantum information theoretic interpretation of the full 27 charge N = 8, D = 5
black hole in terms of a Hilbert space consisting of three copies of the two-qutrit Hilbert space
[8]. It relies on the decomposition E6(6) ⊃[SL(3)]3 and admits the interpretation of a bipartite
entanglement of three qutrits2, with the entanglement measure given by Cartan’s cubic E6(6)
invariant.
2As explained in section 12.6, our terminology bipartite entanglement of three qutrits diﬀers from that used in some of the
QI literature.

3. The classiﬁcation of the bipartite entanglements of three qutrits is related to the classiﬁcation of
N = 8, D = 5 supersymmetric black holes [11] shown in Table 3 and explained in more detail in
section 12.5.

Table 3: The D = 5 analogue of Table 1 and Table 3 relates two-qutrit entanglements and their corresponding D = 5, N = 8
black holes.
4. There are similar correspondences with the black holes of the N = 2 magic supergravities in
D = 5 [26].
5. Turning to the microscopic interpretation of black hole entropy in M- theory, one can consider
conﬁgurations of intersecting M2-branes, whose wrapping around the six compact dimensions T 6
provides the microscopic M-theoretic interpretation of the charges. The two-qutrit basis vectors
|AB⟩, (A, B = 0 or 1 or 2) are associated with the corresponding 9 wrapping cycles, where |0⟩
corresponds to xoo, |1⟩to oxo and |2⟩to oox as in Table 36.
6. In particular, one can relate a well-known fact of quantum information theory, that the most
general real two-qutrit state can be parameterised by three real numbers, to a well-known fact of
M- theory, that the 9-charge black hole can be described by three intersecting M2-branes.
M-theory and octonions
This is a two-way process and the qubit interpretation can also teach us new things about M-theory:
1. The role played by the theory of hyperdeterminants [27] in constructing U-duality invariants.
2. The remarkable fact that E7 has a natural structure of an O-graded algebra [28, 29], compatible
with its action on the minimal 56-dimensional representation, provides a new octonionic view of
M-theory compactiﬁed on T 7, and hence a new quaternionic view of string theory compactiﬁed
on T 6. Explicitly, as discussed in section 8.6

(1.6)
are the seven lines, and we have attached to each line a two-dimensional vector space Al. e0 is the
real octonion and ei are the imaginary ones. The same formulae hold good if we go to the dual
Fano plane by swapping the roles of points and lines. There is a quaternionic analogue of this
construction where we consider just three of the seven lines. This describes the N = 4 subsector.
Strings can carry two kinds of charge: NS-NS coming from right and left moving bosonic modes
and R-R coming from right and left moving fermionic modes (NS = Neveu-Schwarz and R =
Ramond). When the U-duality group E7(7) is decomposed under the SL(2) S-duality and SO(6, 6)
T-duality
E7(7) ⊃SL(2) × SO(6, 6),
56
→(2, 12) + (1, 32),
(1.7)
the ﬁrst term describes the N = 4 subsector with 24 NS-NS charges and the second term describes
the 32 R-R charges. In terms of the above seven lines of the Fano plane of Figure 12 (which describe
9

the seven imaginary octonions), the NS-NS charges correspond to the three lines 124, 561, 713
(which describe the three imaginary quaternions) and the R-R to the four lines 235, 346, 457, 672
(which describe the four complementary imaginary octonions).
3. Noting that 24 = 8 × 3, we show in section 11.2, that these NS-NS charges may be interpreted as
the 8 charges of the STU model deﬁned over the 3 imaginary quaternions. Accordingly, the N = 4
Cartan invariant with SL(2) × SO(6, 6) symmetry, may be written as Cayley’s hyperdeterminant
deﬁned over the imaginary quaternions, provided we adopt a suitable operator ordering3.
4. Noting that 56 = 8 × 7, it is tempting to employ a similar construction replacing imaginary
quaternions by imaginary octonions to describe the full 56 charges, including the 32 R-R. Here,
however, the relationship is more subtle. Since the N = 8 Cartan invariant is just the singlet in
56×56×56×56, it follows from (1.4) that it may indeed be expressed as a quartic combination of
octonions. However, as explained in section 11 it is not simply given by Cayley over the octonions,
at least if Cayley is deﬁned in the usual way. Nevertheless, the two are closely related4.
5. We emphasise that this way of incorporating the octonions, inspired by the Fano plane qubit
interpretation, is completely diﬀerent from the role of octonions in the description of N = 8 su-
pergravity using Jordan algebras and Freudenthal triple systems [30, 4, 31] , described in section 9.
For example, in the former we are dealing with the 7 imaginary octonions, while in the latter we
are dealing with the 8 split octonions. There are other important diﬀerences. These are described
in section 10.3, where we provide a dictionary to go from one language to the other.
1.2. Summary of Report
The purpose of this Report is twofold. First we summarise the progress made so far in this interplay
between black hole entropy and quantum information theory and secondly we describe some new so-far
unpublished developments. Both black holes and entanglement are subjects that can be quite technical, but
our aim is to make our exposition understandable to both communities.
We begin in section 2 with some background material on supergravity, string theory and M-theory,
focussing on the issue of U-duality and black hole entropy required in subsequent sections. In particular we
identify the U-duality group of the STU model as [SL(2)]3.
Section 3 serves a similar purpose for quantum information theory, introducing some elementary concepts
such as entanglement and SLOCC (Stochastic Local Operations and Classical Communication). In particular
we identify the group of invertible SLOCC transformations for three qubits as [SL(2)]3, which in fact ﬁrst
suggested the link to black holes. We continue in section 4 with more on qubits, focussing especially on
three qubits and the all-important Cayley’s hyperdeterminant which provides the measure of tripartite
entanglement known as the 3-tangle.
The hyperdeterminant will also determine the D = 4 black hole
entropy. Section 5 performs the analogous role for the two qutrit system and the corresponding 2-tangle
that will be related to the D = 5 black hole entropy.
The black holes of the D = 4, N = 2 STU model are introduced in section 6 and in section 7 we make
the connection with quantum information theory, showing that the black hole entropy as a function of the 8
charges is also given by Cayley’s hyperdeterminant. One may then go further and match the classiﬁcation
of N = 2 black holes to the classiﬁcation of three-qubit entanglements. The higher-order corrections to the
black hole entropy formula also admit a QI interpretation. This section also provides yet more entries in
the dictionary by relating the attractor mechanism on the black hole side to SLOCC on the QI side and
by relating supersymmetric and non-supersymmetric solutions to suppression or non-suppression of bit ﬂip
errors.
The generalisation from N = 2 to N = 8 black holes is the subject of section 8. Here we encounter
Cartan’s quartic invariant which provides the entropy of the 56-charge black hole and is invariant under
3All this suggests that D = 10 string theory compactiﬁed on T 6 is dual to D = 6 string theory compactiﬁed on T 2 deﬁned
over the imaginary quaternions, at least for the NS-NS sector. We hope to return to this elsewhere.
4More speculatively, all this might suggest a similarity between D = 11 M-theory compactiﬁed on T 7 and D = 6 string
theory compactiﬁed on T 2 deﬁned over the imaginary octonions.
10

the E7(7) U-duality. The QI interpretation is that of the tripartite entanglement of seven qubits (Alice,
Bob, Charlie, Daisy, Emma, Fred and George). The entanglement is encoded in the Fano plane which also
provides the multiplication table of the seven imaginary octonions. The seven vertices of the Fano plane
ABCDEFG describe the seven qubits, while the seven lines abcdefg, each passing through three vertices,
describe the intricate tripartite entanglement.
While the Fano plane basis is tailored to describe the seven qubits, the N = 8 black hole is most elegantly
discussed within the framework of Jordan algebras and the Freudenthal triple system (FTS), which is the
subject of section 9. In fact FTS provides a uniﬁed description of both the N = 8 black holes and the magic
N = 2 black holes of section 13. The magic supergravities correspond to Jordan algebras over the reals R,
complex C, quaternions H and octonions O and the N = 8 supergravity to the split octonions Os. The
N = 2 STU model also ﬁts within this scheme with the Jordan algebra being trivial.
In section 10 we provide the three descriptions of the group E7 and its quartic invariant that we will ﬁnd
useful and the dictionaries that link them: Cartan-Fano, Fano-Freudenthal, and Freudenthal-Cartan.
Section 11 shows how the N = 4 SL(2) × SO(6, 6) invariant may, with a suitable choice of operator
ordering, be expressed as Cayley’s quartic hyperdeterminant over the imaginary quaternions. The N = 8
invariant is more subtle. Although it can be expressed as a quartic product of imaginary octonions, it not
the same as Cayley’s hyperdeterminant over the imaginary octonions.
In section 12, we turn our attention to ﬁve-dimensional black holes, which also exhibit non-trivial entropy.
In particular, we ﬁnd a relation between N = 8 black holes and the bipartite entanglement of three qutrits,
with Cartan’s cubic E6 invariant playing the dual roles of black hole entropy and qutrit entanglement
measure.
Magic supergravities in both four and ﬁve dimensions can also be incorporated into the black hole/qubit
and black hole/qutrit correspondence in a way similar to the STU model and the N = 8 models, as
described in section 13. However, involving as they do the Jordan algebras over R, C, H, O, they also oﬀer
an alternative interpretation in terms of unconventional quantum mechanics deﬁned over R, C, H, O. Indeed,
it was just such variations of standard quantum mechanics which led Jordan to propose his algebras in the
ﬁrst place. We compare this new interpretation with the standard one, listing the pros and cons. The main
objection, in our view, is that while it seems to work well in ﬁve dimensions, we have been unable to get it
to work in four.
One might ask why black holes should display any kind of two-valuedness at all. We answer this question
in section 14 by turning to the microscopic interpretation of black hole entropy in Type IIB string theory. One
can associate conﬁgurations of intersecting D3-branes, whose wrapping around the six compact dimensions
T 6 provides the microscopic string-theoretic interpretation of the charges. The three-qubit basis vectors
|ABC⟩, (A, B, C = 0 or 1) are associated with the corresponding 8 wrapping cycles, where |0⟩corresponds to
xo and |1⟩to ox as in Table 35. Performing a T-duality transformation, one obtains a Type IIA interpretation
with N0 D0-branes, N1, N2, N3 D4-branes plus eﬀective D2-brane charges, where |0⟩now corresponds to
xx and |1⟩to oo. To wrap or not to wrap; that is the qubit. Similarly, in M-theory, one can associate
conﬁgurations of intersecting M2-branes, whose wrapping around the six compact dimensions T 6 provides
the microscopic M-theoretic interpretation of the charges. The two-qutrit basis vectors |AB⟩, (A, B = 0 or
1 or 2) are associated with the corresponding 9 wrapping cycles, where |0⟩corresponds to xoo, |1⟩to oxo
and |2⟩to oox as in Table 36.
Finally, in section 15 we list some unsolved problems and directions for future research.
Appendix A gives a historical overview of Cayley’s original 1845 treatment of the hyperdeterminant.
In Appendix B we look at superalgebras [32] for M-theory in D = 11, Type IIA theory on D = 10 and
Type IIB theory in D = 10 in order to see how the central charges give rise to the black hole charges in
D = 4 after compactiﬁcation on either T 7 or T 6.
The SLOCC group for an n-qudit state is given by G = [SL(d, C)]n, but subspaces of the dn-dimensional
Hilbert space may display hidden symmetries not contained in G. As we shall see, these include an E7(C)
symmetry of a 56-dimensional subspace of seven qutrits and E6(C) symmetry of a 27-dimensional subspace of
three 7-dits. In Appendix C we explore some more possibilities, involving in particular the observation that
a 224-dimensional subspace of eight qutrits, describing the 4-way entanglement of 8 qubits, may be assigned
to the coset-space E8/[SL(2)]8. We have conﬁned these coset constructions to the Appendix because we
11

have as yet no good application of them within quantum information theory.
In Appendix D we discuss the PSL(2, F7), the discrete subgroup of E7 which is the symmetry of the
Fano plane, and its 56-dimensional representation.
2. BLACK HOLES
2.1. Supergravity, string theory and M-theory
One of the central dilemmas of XXI century physics is that the two main pillars of XX century physics,
quantum mechanics and Einstein’s general theory of relativity, seem to be mutually incompatible. General
relativity fails to comply with the quantum rules that govern the behaviour of elementary particles, while
black holes are challenging the very foundations of quantum mechanics. Something big has to give.
Until recently, the best hope for a theory that would unite gravity with quantum mechanics and describe
all physical phenomena was based on strings: one-dimensional objects whose modes of vibration represent
the elementary particles. In 1995, however, strings were subsumed by M-theory. In the words of Edward
Witten [33, 34], M stands for magic, mystery or membrane, according to taste. New evidence in favour of
this theory continues to appear.
M-theory, like string theory, relies crucially on the idea of supersymmetry [35]. Supersymmetry requires
that for each known boson there is a fermion of equal mass. However, no such superpartners have yet been
found. The symmetry, if it exists at all, must be broken, so that the postulated particles do not have the
same mass as known ones but instead are too heavy to be seen in current accelerators. The Large Hadron
Collider at CERN Geneva, will be looking for just these particles. Theorists persist with supersymmetry
because it provides a framework within which the weak, electromagnetic and strong forces may be united
with gravity.
Conventional gravity does not place any limits on the possible dimensions of spacetime: its equations
can, in principle, be formulated in any dimension. Not so with supergravity [36, 37, 38], which places an
upper limit of 11 on the dimensions of space-time (10 of space and one of time). In 1978 Cremmer, Julia
and Scherk [39] realised that supergravity not only permits up to seven extra dimensions but is most elegant
when written in 11-dimensional form. The kind of real, four-dimensional world the theory ultimately predicts
depends on how the extra dimensions are curled up, in the way suggested by Kaluza and Klein in the 1920s
in their uniﬁed theory of gravity and electromagnetism. Seven curled dimensions could conceivably allow
the appearance of the strong and weak nuclear forces, in addition to electromagnetism, For these reasons,
many physicists began to look to supergravity in 11 dimensions for the uniﬁed theory.
In 1984, however, 11-dimensional supergravity was knocked oﬀits pedestal by 10-dimensional superstring
theory. There were ﬁve consistent anomaly-free theories: the E8 × E8 heterotic, the SO(32) heterotic, the
SO(32) Type I, and the Type IIA and Type IIB strings. The Type I is an open string consisting of just a
segment; the others are closed strings that form loops. The E8 ×E8 seemed, at least in principle, capable of
explaining the elementary particles and forces, including their handedness. Furthermore, strings seemed to
provide a theory of gravity consistent with quantum eﬀects without the ultraviolet divergences that plagued
general relativity.
After the initial euphoria over strings, however, doubts began to creep in. First, important questions,
especially how to confront the theory with experiment, seemed incapable of being answered by perturbative
methods. Second, why were there ﬁve diﬀerent string theories? If one is looking for a unique Theory of
Everything, this seems like an embarrassment of riches. Third, if supersymmetry permits 11 dimensions,
why do superstrings stop at 10? Finally, if we are going to conceive of pointlike particles as strings, why
not as membranes or more generally as p-dimensional objects, inevitably dubbed p-branes?
Supersymmetry severely restricts the possible dimensions of a p-brane. A spacetime of 11 dimensions
permits a supermembrane and a super 5-brane, called the M2-brane and M5-brane respectively. In 1987
it was shown [40] that if one of the 11 dimensions is a circle, one can wrap the membrane around it once,
pasting the edges together to form a tube. If the radius becomes suﬃciently small, the rolled-up membrane
ends up looking like a string in 10 dimensions; it yields precisely the Type IIA superstring.
12

In a landmark talk at the University of Southern California in 1995, Witten [41] drew together all this
work on strings, branes and 11 dimensions under the umbrella of M-theory in 11 dimensions, which has
11-dimensional supergravity as its low-energy limit. In particular, he pointed out that the strength of the
string coupling constant gs grows with the radius of the 11th dimension: M-theory is intrinsically non-
perturbative! Since then, thousands of papers have appeared conﬁrming that whatever M-theory may be,
it certainly involves branes in an important way.
In 1995 Polchinski [42] realised that certain p-branes, appearing in Type IIA and Type IIB and carrying
R-R charge, admit the dual interpretation as Dirichlet branes or D-branes; surfaces on which open strings
can end. Such breakthroughs have led to a new interpretation of black holes as intersecting black-branes
wrapped around the six curled dimensions of string theory or seven of M-theory. As a result, there are
strong hints that M-theory may even clear up the paradoxes of black holes raised by Hawking, who in
1974 showed that black holes are not entirely black but may radiate energy. In that case, black holes must
possess entropy, which measures the disorder by counting for the number of quantum states available. Yet
the microscopic origin of these states stayed a mystery. The D-brane technology has enabled Strominger
and Vafa [43] to count the number of quantum states in black-branes. They ﬁnd an entropy that agrees
with Hawking’s prediction, placing another feather in the cap of M-theory. Thus, branes are no longer the
ugly ducklings of string theory. They have taken centre stage as the microscopic constituents of M-theory,
as the higher-dimensional progenitors of black holes and as entire universes in their own right.
Despite all these successes, theorists are glimpsing only small corners of M-theory; the big picture is still
lacking. In trying to discover what M-theory really is, the understanding black holes will be an essential
prerequisite.
2.2. U-duality
String theory may be described as a worldsheet sigma-model with the background spacetime as its target
space [44, 45]. Diﬀerent backgrounds generally correspond to diﬀerent quantum string theories. But it might
happen that some of the backgrounds produce physically equivalent theories. In such a case the diﬀerent
backgrounds are mapped into each other by discrete transformations coming from the symmetry groups
of string dualities. These dualities which transform one theory into the other are classiﬁed into T, S and
U-dualities where the latter one is a combination of the other two. In order to explain these transformations
we start by a brief overview on T and S-dualities.
The simplest example of T-duality is provided by superstring theory compactiﬁed on a circle.
The
worldsheet theory with a circle of radius R is dual to that on a circle of radius α′/R where α′ is the tension
of the string. This can be generalised to toroidal compactiﬁcation of string theories where the compact space
is a k-dimensional torus T k. In this case the dimensionally reduced theory is invariant under the discrete
symmetry group SO(k, k, Z) where its discreteness is due to the quantisation of the charges. This is true
not only in the low energy eﬀective theory but also in the full interacting theory. In fact, T-duality is true
perturbatively order by order in the string coupling constant gs. The ﬁelds of the dimensionally reduced
theory transform as representations of this T-duality symmetry group. The space of scalar ﬁelds, or moduli
space, of the theory is given by the coset space
SO(k, k, R)
SO(k, R) × SO(k, R)
(2.1)
factored by the T-duality group SO(k, k, Z). See [46] for a review of T-duality. From the open string or D-
brane point of view, T-duality transforms Dirichlet boundary conditions into Neumann boundary conditions
and vice versa [42].
The other important string theory duality is the S-duality [47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53] which generalises
the electric/magnetic duality of supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories [54]. In contrast to T-duality, S-duality
acts non-perturbatively and is, strictly speaking, still a conjecture, although the evidence in its favour is now
overwhelming. It relates the theory at strong coupling to the same theory at weak coupling. One example
of this duality is provided by Type IIB string theory [55]. The S-duality group transformation is similar
to electric-magnetic duality in super Yang-Mills theory, in which the coupling g2
YM is mapped into 1/g2
YM.
13

In order to explain this duality more explicitly we consider the massless spectrum of the Type IIB theory.
This spectrum contains two scalar ﬁelds φ and C which belong to NS-NS and R-R sectors, respectively. The
former one is called dilaton and the latter one axion. One can write the low energy eﬀective action of the
Type IIB theory in terms of a complex scalar (τ) deﬁned by
τ = C + ie−φ.
(2.2)
It can be shown that the equations of motion are invariant under the symmetry group SL(2, R) under which
τ transforms as
τ →aτ + b
cτ + d,
(2.3)
where a, b, c and d specify the SL(2, R) transformation and satisfy the condition ad −bc = 1. Therefore
there exists a transformation which maps τ into −1/τ. In the case of zero axion (C = 0) it maps weak
coupling into strong coupling, where eφ = gs is the string coupling constant. The other massless ﬁelds which
transform as a doublet under this symmetry group are the fundamental string which carries the charge of
NS-NS 2-form B2 and the D-string which has the charge of the R-R 2-form C2. Noting that the F- and
D-string bound states can be formed and their charges quantised, the correct symmetry group is the integer
subgroup SL(2, Z). This is called the S-duality symmetry group of Type IIB.
Another context in which S-duality arises is in the compactiﬁcation of string theory from ten to four
dimensions where an SL(2, Z) emerges as an electric-magnetic duality that transforms ﬁeld equations into
Bianchi identities. It may be shown to be a consequence of six-dimensional string/string duality [56] which
in turn is a consequence of membrane/ﬁvebare duality of eleven-dimensional M-theory [57]. For N = 2
compactiﬁcations, the combined S- and T -dualities are then given by
SL(2, Z) × SO(l, 2, Z),
(2.4)
where the resulting low-energy limit is (D = 4, N = 2) supergravity coupled to l + 1 vector multiplets [58].
We shall encounter the l = 2 case again in section 6.1. For N = 4 compactiﬁcations, the combined S- and
T-dualities are given by
SL(2, Z) × SO(6, m, Z),
(2.5)
where the resulting low-energy limit is (D = 4, N = 4) supergravity coupled to m vector multiplets [59].
We shall encounter the m = 6 case again in section 8.1.
A interesting phenomenon happens when one considers the strong coupling limit of Type IIA theory. In
that case D0-branes are the lightest objects in the spectrum since their mass is τ0 = 1/gsα′1/2. Therefore
the state of any number n of D0-branes becomes light at strong coupling and reaches a continuum. Such
a continuum limit acts as an extra dimension where the theory becomes noncompact. Therefore one can
conclude that the strong coupling limit of Type IIA theory is the 11-dimensional theory M-theory [41]. The
low energy eﬀective action of M-theory is 11-dimensional supergravity and the non-perturbative objects in
this theory are M2-branes and their magnetic duals, the M5-branes.
The S and T-duality groups can be uniﬁed in a larger group called U-duality [55]. See also [60] for
similar conjectures. U-duality which is a non-perturbative symmetry group mixes the sigma model and
string coupling constants, α′ and gs respectively. For M-theory on Rd × T k or string theory on Rd × T k−1,
where d + k = 11, the reduced theories are invariant under a global symmetry group called the U-duality
group.
The reduced d-dimensional low energy eﬀective action, which is the d-dimensional supergravity
theory, is invariant under a continuous symmetry group and the discrete subgroup of it, the U-duality
group, is the symmetry of the full theory.
A classiﬁcation of symmetry groups of the supergravities with 32 supercharges in diﬀerent dimensions
has been given in Table 4 [61]. A general prescription is given for 3 ≤k ≤8 where the global symmetry
group can be identiﬁed as the exceptional group Ek(k) which is the maximally noncompact form of Ek
[62]. The maximal discrete subgroups of the groups G are in fact the U-duality groups of the compactiﬁed
theories in diﬀerent dimensions. Regarding the 10-dimensional Type IIA and IIB theories, SL(2, Z) is the
S-duality group of Type IIB while SO(1, 1, Z) is the symmetry group of Type IIA. Speciﬁcally for d = 3,
14

4 and 5 dimensions the exceptional groups Ek(k)(Z) contain the subgroup SL(2, Z) × SO(k −1, k −1, Z).
This can be identiﬁed as S-duality group SL(2, Z) and T-duality group SO(k −1, k −1, Z) coming from the
compactiﬁcation of string theory on T k−1.
Using the maximal compact subgroup H of G in Table 4, one can form the coset space G/H which deﬁnes
the homogeneous space to which the moduli belong. The number of the scalar ﬁelds of the compactiﬁed
theory is equal to the dimension of the coset space, dim G −dim H.
Of special interest is the compactiﬁcation to four dimensions where the U-duality group is
E7(7),
(2.6)
the non-compact form of E7 with 63 compact and 70 non-compact generators. The resulting low-energy
limit is (D = 4, N = 8) supergravity with 28 abelian vector ﬁelds. The 28 electric and 28 magnetic black
hole charges transform as an irreducible 56 of E7(7) as shown in Table 5 which we have taken from [63, 64].
We shall encounter these again in section 8.1.
For compactiﬁcation to ﬁve dimensions, on the other hand, the analogue of (2.4) is
SO(1, 1, Z) × SO(l −1, 1, Z),
(2.7)
for which the resulting low-energy limit is (D = 5, N = 2) supergravity coupled to l vector multiplets. The
analogue of (2.5) is
SO(1, 1, Z) × SO(m −1, 5, Z),
(2.8)
for which the resulting low-energy limit is (D = 5, N = 4) supergravity coupled to m −1 vector multiplets.
The analogue of (2.6) is
E6(6),
(2.9)
the non-compact form of E6 with 36 compact and 42 non-compact generators. The resulting low-energy
limit is (D = 5, N = 8) supergravity which has 27 abelian vector ﬁelds. This gives rise to 27 electric black
hole charges and 27 magnetic black string charges as shown in Table 5.
We shall encounter all three analogues again in section 12.1. Note that upon dimensional reduction
from D = 5 to D = 4 we recover the corresponding three four-dimensional cases which each have one more
abelian vector (the Kaluza-Klein photon).

is that the black hole entropies must be U-duality invariants [65, 66, 67, 68], and it is these invariants that
will also play the role of the new entanglement measures on the QI side. A discussion of more conventional
entanglement measures may be found in [69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84].
2.3. Black hole entropy
As we have seen, the low energy limit of string theory gives rise to gravity coupled to matter ﬁelds which
include vectors and scalars. Therefore these theories typically admit black hole solutions.

Indeed, string theory, D-branes and M-theory have provided a useful theoretical framework in which to
study the classical and quantum properties of black holes. Since the work of Bekenstein and Hawking in the
1970s we know that black holes behave like thermodynamic systems characterised by their entropy and other
thermodynamic quantities. Black hole physics provides a nice relationship between geometrical properties
of space-time and thermodynamic properties of a statistical system. This relation has been explicitly shown
by a set of laws, called the laws of black hole mechanics, in analogy with the laws of thermodynamics [85].
See Table 6. The zeroth law states that the surface gravity κS of a stationary black hole is constant over

the event horizon. Surface gravity is a quantity which measures the strength of the gravitational ﬁeld on the
event horizon. Compared to the ﬁrst law of thermodynamics one can conclude that the surface gravity acts
like the temperature. In fact if one analyses black holes in quantum ﬁeld theory in a curved background,
where gravity is considered classically and matter ﬁelds are treated quantum mechanically, one can see that
they emit radiation, called Hawking radiation. In comparison with the black body spectrum one ﬁnds that
the temperature of the radiation is
TH = ℏκS
2π .
(2.10)
For a stationary black hole, the ﬁrst law of black hole mechanics relates the variation of the energy to the
other conserved quantities of the black hole such as angular momentum J and charge Q. It states that
δM = κS
8π δA + µδQ + ΩδJ ,
(2.11)
where µ is the electric potential, Ωis the angular velocity of rotation and A is the area of the event horizon.
This is an interesting statement because it relates the quantities measured at inﬁnity such as mass, charge
and angular momentum to the quantities measured on the event horizon like surface gravity and the area
of the horizon. Having the temperature given by (2.10) and comparing the relation (2.11) with the ﬁrst law
of thermodynamics suggests taking the area as the entropy of the black hole:
SBH =
A
4ℏG4
,
(2.12)
where G4 is the four dimensional Newton constant. This is called the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. Note
that this formula is reliable only in classical gravity and changes as one considers higher order terms in the
action. The analogy of the area and the entropy is conﬁrmed by the second law of black hole mechanics
which states the total area of all event horizons is non-decreasing. This is a statement about non-stationary
processes in space-time such as black hole collisions.
The laws of black hole mechanics raise two important questions. The ﬁrst concerns the statistical inter-
pretation of Bekenstein-Hawking entropy as the logarithm of the number of quantum states associated with
the black hole. Although we do not have a complete answer to this question yet, string theory has provided
17

an answer to a special class of black holes, extremal black holes. Since they have zero Hawking temperature
they do not radiate and are stable. Some of these black holes are stable by virtue of preserving some super-
symmetry and one has control over the dynamics of microscopic conﬁgurations. In the string theory context
these microscopic conﬁgurations which represent the black hole, involve D-branes, fundamental (F-) strings
and other solitonic objects [86, 87, 42]. In the next subsection we give an overview on extremal black holes.
The second question concerns the information loss problem: the thermal nature of the radiation from
the evaporating black hole appears to involve a loss of information, in contradiction to standard quantum
mechanics. String theory provides some clues to this problem but it is still an open question which we will
not discuss here. Reviews on black holes in string theory can be found in [88, 31, 12].
2.4. Extremal black holes
Let us consider a static, spherically symmetric four-dimensional black hole whose line element can be
written
ds2 = −e2h(r)dt2 + e2k(r)dr2 + r2(dθ2 + sin2θdφ2).
(2.13)
The most general static black hole solution of Einstein-Maxwell theory is given by Reissner-Nordstr¨om
solution which has the metric of the above form where
e2h(r) = e−2k(r) = 1 −2M
r
+ Q2
r2 ,
(2.14)
with Q and M the charge and the mass of the black hole. The mass of an asymptotically ﬂat space-time is
determined by the non-relativistic motion of a test particle in the asymptotically ﬂat region. Such a particle
sees a Newtonian gravitational potential V = −M
r where M is related to 1
r deviation of the metric from
ﬂat space-time given by gtt = −(1 −2M
r + · · · ). Like the mass, the charge of the black hole is measured at
asymptotic region by
Q = 1
4π
I
S2∞
⋆F,
(2.15)
where S2
∞is a spacelike sphere at inﬁnity and ⋆F is the ﬁeld strength dual. (The black hole can also carry
magnetic charge
P = 1
4π
I
S2∞
F,
(2.16)
and we just need to replace Q2 with Q2 + P 2 in all the formulae). The electric ﬁeld strength at inﬁnity is
Frt = Q
r2 .
(2.17)
Besides the mass and the charge which are measured at inﬁnity there are two other quantities, surface
gravity and the area, measured on the event horizon that are given by
κS =
p
M 2 −Q2
2M(M +
p
M 2 −Q2) −Q2 ,
A = 4π(M +
p
M 2 −Q2)2.
(2.18)
The solution (2.13) has two horizons determined by grr = 0 which gives
r± = M ±
p
M 2 −Q2.
(2.19)
Using the above formulae one can see that the condition to have the singularity hidden behind the horizon
for the charged black holes is to have M ≥|Q|. These black holes have smooth geometries at the horizon
and free-falling observers would not feel anything as they fall through the horizon.
For the case where we have M < |Q|, the event horizon vanishes and the solution has a naked singularity
which is considered to be unphysical according to the cosmic censorship hypothesis.
18

An interesting case is where one considers M = |Q|. For these kinds of black hole, which are called
extremal black holes, the two horizons, r+ and r−, coincide and the radius of the horizon gets ﬁxed in terms
of the charge of the black hole, r0 = |Q|. Similarly the area of the horizon gets simpliﬁed and reduces
to A = 4πQ2, as can be seen from (2.18).
Therefore the entropy which is proportional to the area is
completely determined in terms of the charges of the extremal black hole. This is an important observation
for extremal black holes resulting from the attractor mechanism. We will elaborate more on this phenomenon
in section 7.5. It is related to the fact that, for static solutions in four dimensions, the near horizon geometry
of the extremal black holes reduces to AdS2 × S2 where AdS is anti-de Sitter space.
Another noteworthy observation is that the surface gravity for extremal black holes is zero, using the
relation (2.18). Therefore the temperature which is for the static solutions in four dimensions given by
TH = ℏκS
2π
(2.20)
is also zero. Since the Hawking radiation is proportional to the temperature, one can conclude that the
extremal black holes are stable.
The supergravity theories we shall consider in this Report have more than the one photon of Einstein-
Maxwell theory. The (D = 4, N = 2) STU model has 4; the (D = 4, N = 8) model has 28, so the black
holes will carry 8 or 56 electric and magnetic charges, respectively. Similarly, the (D = 5, N = 8) black hole
and black string have 27 electric and 27 magnetic charges, respectively. They also involve scalar ﬁelds [89].
Consequently the extremal black holes obey generalised mass = charge conditions described in subsequent
sections. A black hole that preserves some unbroken supersymmetry (admitting one or more Killing spinors)
is said to be BPS (after Bogomol’nyi-Prasad-Sommerﬁeld) and non-BPS otherwise. All BPS black holes are
extremal but extremal black holes can be BPS or non-BPS.

3. QUANTUM INFORMATION THEORY
3.1. Qubits and quantum information theory
In completely separate developments, exciting things were happening in the world of quantum informa-
tion theory. Quantum entanglement is a phenomenon in which the quantum states of two or more objects
must be described with reference to each other, even though the individual objects may be spatially sepa-
rated [90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96]. This leads to correlations between observable physical properties of the
systems that are classically forbidden. For example, as described in section 4.2.3, it is possible to prepare
two particles in a single quantum state such that when one is observed to be spin-up, the other one will
always be observed to be spin-down and vice versa, this despite the fact that it is impossible to predict,
according to quantum mechanics, which set of measurements will be observed. As a result, measurements
performed on one system seem to be instantaneously inﬂuencing other systems entangled with it. Note,
however, that quantum entanglement does not enable the transmission of classical information faster than
the speed of light.
Quantum entanglement has applications in the emerging technologies of quantum computing and quan-
tum cryptography, and has been used to realise quantum teleportation experimentally. At the same time, it
prompts interesting discussions concerning the interpretation of quantum theory. The correlations predicted
by quantum mechanics, and observed in experiment, reject the principle of local realism, which is that infor-
mation about the state of a system should only be mediated by interactions in its immediate surroundings
and that the state of a system exists and is well-deﬁned before any measurement.
3.2. LOCC and SLOCC
The concept of entanglement is the single most important feature distinguishing classical information
theory from quantum information theory. It has become clear to the quantum information community that,
in order to exploit quantum states for communication, computation and other such purposes, it is necessary
to develop a theory that naturally describes how entanglement works and how to harness its uses. The
principle of Local Operations and Classical Communication, or LOCC for short, has become the paradigm
by which we may achieve this goal. Heuristically, entanglement can be understood as correlations between
two or more quantum systems which cannot be of a classical origin. Thus, in order properly to understand
entanglement we must distinguish correlations of a classical nature from those of a quantum nature. The
LOCC paradigm is used to precisely characterise all possible classical correlations. Any classical correlation
may be experimentally established using LOCC. Conversely, all correlations not achievable via LOCC are
attributed to genuine quantum correlations. That is, LOCC cannot create entanglement [82]. What is more,
it has been shown, using the LOCC paradigm, that all non-separable states can perform some task which is
not possible with any separable state. This underlies the interchangeability of the terms entanglement and
non-separability [82].
LOCC essentially describes a multi-step process for transforming any input state to a diﬀerent output
state while obeying certain rules. Given any multipartite state, we may split it up into its relevant parts
and send each of them to diﬀerent labs around the world. We allow the respective scientists to perform any
experiment they see ﬁt; they may then communicate these results to each other classically (using email or
phone or carrier pigeon). Furthermore, for the most general LOCC, we allow them to do this as many times
as they like.
Using the aforementioned protocol one may create only separable states and hence it must be impossible
for any entanglement to be generated since entangled states are non-separable. Therefore, we may demand
that any would-be function for measuring entanglement must be a monotonically decreasing function of
any LOCC transformation.
Any function fulﬁlling this and a couple other criteria will be deemed an
entanglement monotone. We will shortly arrive at a mathematical description of what this means, but ﬁrst
we must discuss LOCC.
In order to understand the mathematical formulation of LOCC transformations, we should brieﬂy cover
Positive Operator Valued Measures (POVMs). The ﬁeld of POVMs is rather large and technical see for
example [97, 98, 99], for now we will content ourselves with a basic functional introduction. The following
introduction leans heavily on Nielsen and Chuang [97].
20

POVMs are a generalisation of what is called projective measurement. Projective measurements are
the usual quantum measuring operators that square to one and form an orthonormal basis. They have the
following form
Pi = |Ψi⟩⟨Ψi|
(3.1)
with the following familiar properties

(3.2d)
According to the Copenhagen Interpretation, any state |Φ⟩can expanded in the measurement basis
|Φ⟩=
X
i
ai|Ψi⟩,
ai ∈C,
(3.3)
and a measurement will result in the collapse of the state |Φ⟩to one of the eigenvectors |Ψi⟩, with a
probability given by a∗
i ai. This much is known already. The problem is that this language is not ideally
suited for real life quantum experiments nor does it adequately describe the space of possible quantum
operators. For this we use density matrices and POVMs.
One way to obtain POVMs is to relax the orthogonality condition (3.2b) to allow a set of operators
Ei that are positive and complete (the Hermiticity condition is implied as this is always true for positive
operators). In this formalism, we may take any set of matrices that are positive and complete, {Ei}; these
will then form set of POVM elements Ei, for which the measurement operators, Mi, will be deﬁned as
Mi =
p
Ei,
(3.4)
where the square root of a matrix is deﬁned as the positive square root of the eigenvalues in the basis in
which the matrix is diagonal. Hence we have P
i M †
i Mi = P
i Ei = I and the probability that the state |Ψ⟩
will go to the state Mi|Ψ⟩is given by pi = ⟨Ψ|M †
i Mi|Ψ⟩
We will shortly further generalise POVMs to quantum operators, which will form the basis of our
discussion of LOCC, but before we do that, we must brieﬂy discuss the density matrix. The density matrix
is essentially a reformulation of the usual state vector formulation but it has the added bonus that it
deals with any quantum state that contains mixtures of classical and quantum correlations in a completely
consistent way. For example, if we know that the output from a certain source is likely to be a certain
ensemble of states |Ψi⟩with probabilities pi, then the density matrix ρ is deﬁned to be
ρ =
X
i
pi|Ψi⟩⟨Ψi|.
(3.5)
Instead of dealing with a vector |Ψi⟩and keeping track of various pi associated with which state the system
might be in, we now deal with a matrix ρ that takes care of all of that.
When we know the exact state of the system, then all but one of the pi’s will be zero and the density
matrix reduces to ρ = |Ψ⟩⟨Ψ|. This allows us to distinguish two types of density matrices, those which are
pure like the one in the previous sentence and can be expressed in a form such that ρ = |Ψ⟩⟨Ψ| and those
that are mixed which can only be expressed in the form (3.5), as an ensemble average of density matrices.
Let us now consider how the density matrix transforms under a general POVM. The probability of
getting the result associated with measurement operator Mm from initial state |ψi⟩is given by
p (m|i) = ⟨ψi|M †
mMm|ψi⟩
= tr
 M †
mMm|ψi⟩⟨ψi|

.
(3.6)
21

But p(m) = P
i p(m|i)pi so
p(m) =
X
i
p (m|i) pi
=
X
i
tr
 M †
mMm|ψi⟩⟨ψi|

pi
= tr
 M †
mMmρ

.
(3.7)
Now, under the action of POVM elements Mm, on the state |ψi⟩, we have
|ψi⟩→|ψm
i ⟩=
Mm|ψi⟩
q
⟨ψi|M †
mMm|ψi⟩
.
(3.8)
To see how the density matrix transforms, let us consider ρm associated with result m from an ensemble of
states |ψm
i ⟩, which will then have probabilities p(i|m)
ρm =
X
i
p(i|m)|ψm
i ⟩⟨ψm
i |
=
X
i
p(i|m)Mm|ψi⟩⟨ψi|M †
m
⟨ψi|M †
mMm|ψi⟩
,
(3.9)
where we substituted |ψm
i ⟩from (3.8). Now, from probability theory, we know p(i|m) = p(m, i)/p(m) =
p(m|i)pi/p(m), which on substituting in (3.9), gives us
ρm =
X
i
p(i)Mm|ψi⟩⟨ψi|M †
m
⟨ψi|M †
mMm|ψi⟩
=
MmρM †
m
tr

M †
mMmρ
.
(3.10)
We now prove that the necessary and suﬃcient conditions for a matrix to be a density operator are that
its trace is 1 and that it is positive. Let us suppose that ρ = P
i pi|ψi⟩⟨ψi|, then
tr ρ =
X
i
pi tr (|ψi⟩⟨ψi|) =
X
i
pi = 1,
(3.11)
and for an arbitrary state |φ⟩we have
⟨φ|ρ|φ⟩=
X
i
pi⟨φ|ψi⟩⟨ψi|φ⟩
=
X
i
pi|⟨φ|ψi⟩|2
≥0.
(3.12)
Conversely, suppose that ρ is positive and has trace 1, then it must have a spectral decomposition
ρ =
X
i
λi|i⟩⟨i|,
(3.13)
where the λi are real, positive eigenvalues of ρ, and from the trace condition we have P
i λi = 1 which
implies ρ describes the ensemble {λi, |i⟩}.
22

We may now extend our earlier analysis of POVMs to quantum operators. Considering quantum states
as positive matrices with trace 1, we may now deﬁne any valid quantum process as a map
ρ →E(ρ)
(3.14)
from the domain to the codomain of valid density operators. We include those functions that enlarge or
reduce the Hilbert space, either by locally appending ancilla, the new larger joint system being allowed to
evolve unitarily, or by tracing out local subsystems. These superoperators must obey three axioms:
1. tr E(ρ) is the probability that the transformation ρ →E(ρ) occurs.
2. E(ρ) is a linear convex map on the set of density operators, that is,
E (P
i piρi) = P
i piE (ρi) .
(3.15)
This is necessary so that E(ρ) makes sense as a density matrix in its own right.
3. E(ρ) is a completely positive map. Requiring only positivity allows one to construct maps that are
positive on a subsystem but not on the complete Hilbert space; complete positivity cures that problem.
Using these three axioms, it is not too hard to show that
E (ρ) =
X
i
EiρE†
i ,
(3.16)
for some set Ei of operators that map the input Hilbert space to the output Hilbert space and obey
P
i E†
i Ei ≤1. These E are called Completely Positive maps (CP maps), and if they satisfy the stronger
condition P
i E†
i Ei = 1 then they are called Completely Positive Trace Preserving maps (CPTP maps) and
are like the POVMs. We are now in a position to describe LOCC.
As explained earlier, LOCC is the name of a class of protocols that act on any multi-party quantum
state that is split between a number of parties (say Alice in France, Bob in the States, and Charlie on the
moon, etc...). Alice, Bob and Charlie are allowed to perform any local quantum operation they want (LO)
and communicate the results back to the others (CC) for further experimentation. It is deemed self evident
that one cannot introduce non-local quantum correlations using this process, and hence that entanglement
can never be created by this process.
For now we will assume that any LOCC process is deterministic but not necessarily reversible (i.e. we
may consider maps that enlarge/reduce the Hilbert space, including measurements, but only if they do so
with certainty). This requires us to consider only CPTP maps E. The classiﬁcation of LOCC protocols may
be found in [84, 100].
Equipped with a mathematically precise prescription for LOCC (it ought to be noted that this is still, to
some extent, an open question) we may begin to address the issues of using and quantifying entanglement.
Generally, in quantum information theory, we are interested in how we can usefully convert n copies of a
state |ψ⟩into m maximally entangled states, and the protocol for doing so will be a LOCC protocol. In
the limit in which n →∞it is possible to use these protocols to get bounds on asymptotic entanglement
measures such as the entanglement of formation and the entanglement of dissolution [72, 82].
For these protocols one would generally use irreversible LOCC, meaning that the protocol will always
succeed, but it is impossible return the ﬁnal states to the initial states. This is ﬁne if we have n copies of a
state, but if we only have one copy, we do not have this ‘asymptotic freedom’. If we only have one copy of
the state we are going to be interested in classifying it under reversible LOCC, so that we may equate any
state with any other state that can be reached by a reversible LOCC protocol.
3.3. LOCC and SLOCC equivalence
As emphasised LOCC cannot create entanglement. Consequently, from a quantum information theoretic
perspective, any two states which may be interrelated using LOCC ought to be physically equivalent with
respect to their entanglement properties. This motivates the concept of LOCC equivalence, introduced in
[72]. Two states lie in the same LOCC equivalence class if and only if they may be transformed into one
23

another using LOCC operations. Since LOCC cannot create entanglement any two LOCC equivalent states
necessarily have the same entanglement. The set of LOCC transformations relating equivalent states forms
a group. It may be thought of as a gauge group with respect to entanglement in the sense that it mods out
the physically redundant information. It was shown in [72] that two states of a composite system are LOCC
equivalent if and only if they may be transformed into one another using the group of local unitaries (LU),
unitary transformations which factorise into separate transformations on the component parts. In the case
of n qudits, the LU group (up to a phase) is given by [SU(d)]n. The LU orbits partition the Hilbert space
into equivalence classes. For a n-qudit system the space of orbits is given by [101, 76]:
[Cd]n
U(1) × [SU(d)]n .
(3.17)
However, for single copies of pure states this classiﬁcation is both mathematically and physically too
restrictive.
Under LU two states of even the simplest bipartite systems will not, in general, be related
[102]. Continuous parameters are required to describe the space of entanglement classes [101, 76, 103, 77].
In this sense the LU classiﬁcation is too severe [102], obscuring some of the more qualitative features
of entanglement.
An alternative classiﬁcation scheme was proposed in [72, 102].
Rather than declare
equivalence when states are deterministically related to each other by LOCC, we require only that they may
be transformed into one another with some non-zero probability of success.
This coarse graining goes by the name of Stochastic LOCC or SLOCC for short. Stochastic LOCC
includes, in addition to LOCC, those quantum operations that are not trace-preserving, i.e.
we have
tr(E(ρ)) ≤1, so that we no longer require that the protocol always succeeds with certainty. It is proved
in [102] that for n qudits, the SLOCC equivalence group is (up to an overall complex factor) [SL(d, C)]n.
Essentially, we may identify two states if there is a non-zero probability that one can be converted into the
other and vice-versa, which means we get [SL(d, C)]n orbits rather than the [SU(d)]n kind of LOCC. This
generalisation may be physically motivated by the fact that any set of SLOCC equivalent entangled states
may be used to perform the very same non-classical, entanglement dependent, operations, only with varying
likelihoods of success. For a n-qudit state the space of SLOCC equivalence classes is given by [102]:
[Cd]n
[SL(d, C)]n .
(3.18)
For n-qubit systems we have
[C2]n
[SL(2, C)]n
(3.19)
and, in this case, the lower bound on the number of continuous variables needed to parameterise the space
of orbits is 2(2n −1)−6n. Note, for three qubits the space of orbits is ﬁnite and discrete (see Table 1) giving
the concise classiﬁcation of entanglement classes of [102].
3.4. Entanglement monotones
In general, for some function to be an entanglement monotone, we require three axioms:
1. E(ρ) = 0 if ρ is separable. This ﬁxes the bottom end of the scale and ensures that states that are
separable have no entanglement
2. E(ρAB) = E
 (UA ⊗UB)ρAB(UA ⊗UB)†
which means that states that are related under LU transfor-
mations have the same entanglement.
3. E(ρAB) ≥E (E(ρAB)) where E is a CPTP map. This is perhaps the most important axiom and ensures
that our intuitive deﬁnition of entanglement, as something non-local that cannot be created by LOCC,
is correct.
Depending on which source you read [98, 82, 84], it is possible to add a few more axioms, whose essential
point is to guarantee that all pure bipartite measure of entanglement reduce to the Von Neumann entropy
function, i.e.
E (|ψ⟩AB) ≡S(ρ) = −tr(ρ log2 ρ).
(3.20)
24

For our purposes, we need not concern ourselves with these technicalities. See also [104, 105, 106, 107].
Since SLOCC is a coarse graining of LOCC, proving that something is a monotone under SLOCC
operators, is a stronger condition than axiom 3 above (and in most cases simpliﬁes the task of establishing
monotonicity). In fact, this is equivalent to saying that
E(ρ) ≥piE(ρi)
(3.21)
under any CP map E such that ρ →P
i piρi (which, historically, was the original monotone axiom 3 in
the quantum information literature [84]). This is the approach taken by [102] when verifying that Cayley’s
hyperdeterminant is a genuine entanglement monotone (as we will show in section 4.3.5).

4. QUBITS
4.1. One qubit: SL(2)A
Entanglement may be thought of as a quantum information resource in the same sense as entropy or
energy are classical resources [97]. However, its properties profoundly diﬀer from the properties of those
familiar concepts. We have, at best, an incomplete description. In order fully to understand entanglement
we would like to be able to describe precisely its creation and transformation, to classify the distinct types
of entanglement, to quantitatively measure it, to utilise it as a resource and to illustrate, precisely, how it
diﬀers from classical resources at a fundamental level.
We will touch upon each of these topics at some stage of our qubit-black hole discussion suggesting,
already, that it is both a substantial and a proﬁtable line of thought. However, before we do so we must
introduce the basic quantum information theoretic concepts.
A quantum bit, or qubit, is the smallest unit of quantum information. It refers to the state of a 2-level
quantum system, such as the spin-up/spin-down states of an electron. The two basis states are labelled |0⟩
and |1⟩. The one qubit system (Alice) is described by the state
|Ψ⟩= aA|A⟩,
(4.1)
where A = 0, 1, so
|Ψ⟩= a0|0⟩+ a1|1⟩,
(4.2)
and the Hilbert space has dimension 2. As described in section 3.2, the SLOCC group for a single qubit is
SL(2)A, under which aA transforms as a 2:
a0
a1

→
a
b
c
d
 a0
a1

,
(4.3)
where ad −bc = 1.
The density matrix ρ, deﬁned by
ρ = |Ψ⟩⟨Ψ|,
(4.4)
or
ρA1A2 = aA1a∗
A2,
(4.5)
obeys
tr ρ = ⟨Ψ|Ψ⟩.
(4.6)
4.2. Two qubits: SL(2)A × SL(2)B
4.2.1. States
The two qubit system (Alice and Bob) is described by the state
|Ψ⟩= aAB|AB⟩,
(4.7)
where A = 0, 1, so
|Ψ⟩= a00|00⟩+ a01|01⟩+ a10|10⟩+ a11|11⟩
(4.8)
and the Hilbert space has dimension 22 = 4. aAB transforms as a (2, 2) under the SLOCC group SL(2)A ×
SL(2)B.
The determinant of the 2 × 2 matrix aAB is given by
det aAB = 1
2εA1A2εB1B2aA1B1aA2B2
= a00a11 −a01a10
= a0a3 −a1a2,
(4.9)
26

where we have made the binary conversion 0, 1, 2, 3 for 00, 01, 10, 11. Note that
| det a|2 = 1
4εA1A2εB1B2aA1B1aA2B2εA3A4εB3B4a∗

(4.10)
Using the identity
εA1A2εA3A4 = δA1A3δA2A4 −δA1A4δA2A3,
(4.11)
we have
| det a|2 = 1
4(δA1A3δA2A4 −δA1A4δA2A3)εB1B2aA1B1aA2B2εB3B4a∗

2εB1B2εB3B4ρB1B3ρB2B4
= det ρB = det ρA,
(4.12)
where we have deﬁned the reduced density matrices
ρA = TrB|Ψ⟩⟨Ψ|,
ρB = TrA|Ψ⟩⟨Ψ|,
(4.13)
or
(ρA)A1A2 = δB1B2aA1B1a∗
A2B2 = (ρA)A2A1,
(ρB)B1B2 = δA1A2aA1B1a∗
A2B2 = (ρB)B2B1.
(4.14)
Explicitly,
ρA =

where
(σA)A1A2 = εB1B2aA1B1aA2B2 = −(σA)A2A1,
(σB)B1B2 = εA1A2aA1B1aA2B2 = −(σB)B2B1.
(4.18)
4.2.2. Entanglement classiﬁcation
For bipartite pure states, |ψ⟩= aAB|AB⟩, where A = 0, . . . m and B = 0, . . . n5, one can always answer
the question of whether a state is entangled or not. Such a state is separable if and only if aAB is rank one.
The SLOCC classiﬁcation is particularly simple in this case. The set of local unitaries is contained in
SLOCC and consequently, using the Schmidt decomposition, any state |ψ⟩can be written as
|ψ⟩=
nψ
X
i=1
√αi|ii⟩,
αi > 0,
(4.19)
5Without loss of generality we take n ≤m.
27

nψ ≤n, where n is the dimension of the smaller of the two sub-systems. The Schmidt number nψ is given
by the rank of either one of the reduced density matrices (4.15). Since their rank cannot be changed using
SL(m, C) × SL(n, C) there are n entanglement classes under SLOCC [102]. A state of a given rank may
be transformed into any state of a lower rank with some non-zero probability using non-invertible SLOCC
operations. No SLOCC operation can increase the rank of a reduced density matrix. Hence, the SLOCC
classiﬁcation is stratiﬁed: the higher the rank the stronger the entanglement [102].
For a two-qubit system there are then only two SLOCC classes: entangled and separable corresponding
to rank 2 or rank 1 reduced density matrices, respectively. The bipartite entanglement is measured by the
concurrence [69]
CAB = 2
p
det ρA = 2
p
det ρB = 2 | det a|,
(4.20)
or the 2-tangle
τAB = C2
AB = 4(|a0|2|a3|2 + |a1|2|a2|2 −(a0a∗
2a3a∗
1 + a1a∗
3a2a∗
0)).
(4.21)
Recall that the eigenvalues of a 2 × 2 matrix obey the characteristic equation
det ρ −tr ρλ + λ2 = 0.
(4.22)
Hence the eigenvalues of ρA are
λ0 = 1
2[tr ρ +
p
(tr ρ)2 −4 det ρ],
(4.23a)
and
λ1 = 1
2[tr ρ −
p
(tr ρ)2 −4 det ρ],
(4.23b)
obeying
λ0 + λ1 = tr ρ,
λ0λ1
= det ρ.
(4.23c)
so for an entangled state, with non-zero concurrence, ρA has rank 2 but only rank 1 for a product state as
required by the SLOCC classiﬁcation. Note that the 2-tangle may also be written
τAB = 2[(tr ρ)2 −tr ρ2].
(4.24)
4.2.3. Bell states
An example of a separable state is
|Ψ⟩=
1
√
2(||00⟩+ |01⟩),
(4.25)
since when Alice measures 0, Bob can measure either 0 or 1 with equal probability. Here
τAB = 0.
(4.26)
An example of an entangled state is the Bell state:
|Ψ⟩=
1
√
2(|00⟩+ |11⟩),
(4.27)
for which
τAB = 1,
(4.28)
since if Alice measures 0, Bob must also measure 0 and if Alice measures 1, Bob must also measure 1. This
is the origin of the famous EPR “paradox”, since Alice may be in South Kensington and Bob on Alpha
Centauri, yet their measurements are correlated.
For normalised states,
⟨Ψ|Ψ⟩= 1
(4.29a)
28

implies
|a0|2 + |a1|2 + |a2|2 + |a3|2 = 1,
(4.29b)
or
|a0| = ±(1 −a2)1/2,
(4.29c)
where
a2 ≡|a1|2 + |a2|2 + |a3|2.
(4.29d)
One can verify that the 2-tangle is maximised (and equal to unity) when
a0 = a3 =
1
√
2,
a1 = a2 = 0,
(4.30a)
and when
a1 = a2 =
1
√
2,
a0 = a3 = 0.
(4.30b)
These states are obviously entangled since if Alice measures 0 or 1 then Bob must measure 0 or 1, respectively,
in the ﬁrst case and 1 or 0, respectively, in the second.
4.3. Three qubits: SL(2)A × SL(2)B × SL(2)C
4.3.1. States
The three qubit system (Alice, Bob, Charlie) is described by the state
|Ψ⟩= aABC|ABC⟩,
(4.31)
where A = 0, 1, so
|Ψ⟩=
a000|000⟩+ a001|001⟩+ a010|010⟩+ a011|011⟩
+ a100|100⟩+ a101|101⟩+ a110|110⟩+ a111|111⟩,
(4.32)
and the Hilbert space has dimension 23 = 8.
aABC transforms as a (2, 2, 2) under the SLOCC group
SL(2)A × SL(2)B × SL(2)C.
4.3.2. Cayley’s hyperdeterminant
The 3-index quantity aABC is an example of what Cayley termed a hypermatrix. Its elements may be
represented by the cube shown in Figure 1. In 1845 he generalised the determinant of a 2 × 2 matrix to the
hyperdeterminant of a 2 × 2 × 2 hypermatrix aABC [22]

the determinant of a 2 × 2 matrix to the hyperdeterminant of a 2 × 2 × 2 hypermatrix. The hyperdeterminant may also be
assembled from the 2 × 2 matrices formed by partitioning the hypermatrix cube across its planes of symmetry as shown in
section 10.3.

Table 7: Three cyclic permutations of the binary notation. The hyperdeterminant, (4.33a), is invariant under this triality.
where we have made the binary conversion 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 for 000, 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110,
111.
(The cyclic permutations are 0, 4, 1, 5, 2, 6, 3, 7 and 0, 2, 4, 6, 1, 3, 5, 7.
See Table 7.)
The
hyperdeterminant, which we denote by Det with a capital D, is also expressed diagrammatically in Figure 2.
The hyperdeterminant vanishes iﬀthe following system of equations in six unknowns uA, vB, wC has a
nontrivial solution, not allowing any of the pairs to be both zero:
aABCuAvB = 0,
aABCuAwC = 0,
aABCvBwC = 0.
(4.34)
For our purposes, the important properties of the hyperdeterminant are that it is a quartic invariant under
[SL(2)]3 and under a triality that interchanges A, B and C. These properties are valid whether the aABC
are complex, real or integer. For more on three qubit entanglement see [27, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112].
One way to understand this triality is to think of having three diﬀerent metrics (Alice, Bob and Charlie)
γ1(a)A1A2 = εB1B2εC1C2aA1B1C1aA2B2C2,
γ2(a)B1B2 = εC1C2εA1A2aA1B1C1aA2B2C2,
γ3(a)C1C2 = εA1A2εB1B2aA1B1C1aA2B2C2.

Figure 2: A diagrammatic comparison of the hyperdeterminant against the ordinary determinant. The encircled letters denote
tensors and the lines are index contractions. The similarities are manifest as the building blocks are virtually identical, the
principle diﬀerence being the extra indices on the a’s. The hyperdeterminant is simply the determinant of the determinant-like
object γ. (The third indices on the a’s are the free indices of the γ’s).

and
τABC = τA(BC) −τAB −τCA,

τABC = τC(AB) −τCA −τBC,
(4.53)
where τABC is the 3-tangle [21, 113]
τABC = 4| Det a|.
(4.54)
Explicitly, for Det a > 0,
τAB = 4(a0a6 −a4a2 + a1a7 −a5a3)2,
τBC = 4(a0a3 −a2a1 + a4a7 −a6a5)2,
τCA = 4(a0a5 −a1a4 + a2a7 −a3a6)2.
(4.55)
It is also useful to deﬁne
(σA)A1A2 = δB1B2εC1C2aA1B1C1aA2B2C2 = −(σA)A2A1,

Then using the identity

Hence
τAB = 4 det(σC),
τBC = 4 det(σA),
τCA = 4 det(σB).
(4.60)
4.3.4. Entanglement classiﬁcation
Recall, two states of a composite quantum system are regarded as equivalent if they are related by a
unitary transformation which factorises into separate transformations on the component parts, so-called local
unitaries. See section 3.3 and [75, 72, 77, 71, 114, 78] for more details. The Hilbert space decomposes into
equivalence classes, or orbits under the action of the group of local unitaries. For unnormalised three-qubit
states, the number of parameters [101] needed to describe inequivalent states or, what amounts to the same
thing, the number of algebraically independent invariants [103] is given by the dimension of the space of
orbits
C2 × C2 × C2
U(1) × SU(2) × SU(2) × SU(2),
(4.61)
namely 16−10 = 6. For subsequent comparison with the STU black hole, however, we restrict our attention
to states with real coeﬃcients aABC. In this case, one can show that there are ﬁve algebraically independent
invariants: Det a, SA, SB, SC and the norm ⟨Ψ|Ψ⟩, corresponding to the dimension of
R2 × R2 × R2
SO(2) × SO(2) × SO(2),
(4.62)
namely 8 −3 = 5. Hence, the most general real three-qubit state can be described by just ﬁve parameters
[115], conveniently taken as four real numbers N0, N1, N2, N3 and an angle θ:
|Ψ⟩= −N3 cos2 θ|001⟩−N2|010⟩+ N3 sin θ cos θ|011⟩
−N1|100⟩−N3 sin θ cos θ|101⟩+ (N0 + N3 sin2 θ)|111⟩.
(4.63)
Further, under the coarser SLOCC classiﬁcation, D¨ur et al. [102] used simple arguments concerning the
conservation of ranks of reduced density matrices to show that there are only six three-qubit equivalence
classes; only two of which show genuine tripartite entanglement, see Table 1. These are:
Class A-B-C, product states represent completely separable states like
|ψA-B-C⟩= N0|111⟩,
(4.64)
for which all 2-tangles and 3-tangles vanish.
Classes A-BC, AB-C and C-AB, bipartite entanglement. These states have only bipartite entangle-
ment between two of the qubits and zero entanglement with the third, for the class A-BC a represen-
tative is
|ψA-BC⟩= N0|111⟩−N1|100⟩,
(4.65)
and they have their respective τBC ̸= 0 but τABC = 0
34

Class W, tripartite entanglement. The canonical state is
|W⟩= −N1|100⟩−N2|010⟩−N3|001⟩,
(4.66)
for which all 2-tangles do not vanish but the 3-tangle is still zero. These do not violate Bell’s inequalities
but are resilient to information loss: tracing out one qubit leaves a maximally entangled bipartite state.
Class GHZ (Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger [116, 117]) the other genuine tripartite entangled state,
for which the canonical example is
|GHZ⟩= N0|111⟩−N1|100⟩−N2|010⟩−N3|001⟩,
(4.67)
which has non-zero 2-tangles and non-zero τABC. These states are the ones that maximally violate
Bell’s inequalities; they are, however, fragile, as tracing out one qubit leaves you with a mixed bipartite
state.
Using parametrisation (4.63), representatives from each SLOCC class can be found in Table 8.
The state (4.63) is obtained from the canonical form for real states [118],
|Ψ⟩= a0|000⟩+ a4|100⟩+ a5|101⟩+ a6|110⟩+ a7|111⟩
(4.68)
by applying two diﬀerent SO(2) transformations on the second and third bits, 1A ⊗TB ⊗TC where

TC =

4.3.5. Monotonicity of the 3-tangle
In this section we prove (following [102]) that E = √τABC is a monotone. In general we would want to
prove that √τABC is a monotone under any transformations on Alice, Bob or Charlie. However, the triality
invariance of Cayley’s hyperdeterminant under interchange of parties aﬀords us a simpliﬁcation. Since any
SLOCC protocol can always be broken down into transformations on one party followed by some classical
communication, and since τABC is invariant under interchange, we need only consider transformations on
Alice. We further note that any local POVM can be implemented by a sequence of two outcome POVMs
[102], so we only have to consider POVMs A1 and A2, with the following condition
A†
1A1 + A†
2A2 = 1.
(4.71)
Under Ai, state |ψ⟩goes to | ˜φi⟩= Ai|ψ⟩with pi = ⟨˜φi| ˜φi⟩representing the probability that operation Ai
succeeds. After normalising, we have |φi⟩= ˜φi/√pi. So, we require
E(ψ) ≥p1E(φ1) + p2E(φ2),
(4.72)
where
E(ψ) = √τABC =
p
4| Det(ψ)|.
(4.73)
For Cayley we have (4.37)
Det (ψ) = −det γA1A2,
(4.74)
where
γA1A2 = εB1B2εC1C2aA1B1C1aA2B2C2.
(4.75)
Under a transformation on Alice (Ai ⊗1B ⊗1C), we have
γA1A2 →εB1B2εC1C2aA1B1C1aA2B2C2

which gives

(4.77)
Next, we use the singular value decomposition, which allows us to express any positive matrix as a
product of a unitary matrix, a diagonal matrix and a diﬀerent unitary matrix [97]. We have
Ai = UiDiV,
(4.78)
where Ui ∈SU(2), V ∈U(2) and the Di are diagonal such that
D1 =

a
b

,
D2 =
+
p
(1 −a2)
+
p
(1 −b2)

,
(4.79)
where a, b ∈[0, 1]; hence, we have det Ui = 1, det V = eiθ, det D1 = ab and det D2 =
p
(1 −a2)(1 −b2).
This gives det A1 = abeiθ. For A1, if we put all this in (4.77) and recalling that φi = ˜φi/pi, we get
det γA1A2(φ1) = det AT
1 det γ(ψ/√p1) det A1
= a2b2
p2
1
γ(ψ)e2iθ,
(4.80)
36

and for A2, we get
det γA1A2(φ2) = det AT
2 det γ(ψ/√p2) det A2
= (1 −a2)(1 −b2)
p2
2
γ(ψ)e2iθ.
(4.81)
Substituting into E, we have
E(ψ) →p1
√τ(φ1) + p2
√τ(φ2)
= ab√τ(ψ) +
p
(1 −a2)(1 −b2)√τ(ψ)
=


E(ψ).
(4.82)
Finally we note that (4.82) is maximised for a = b and hence the condition in (3.21) is satisﬁed and √τABC
is always decreasing, and hence a monotone.

B transforms as a (3, 3) under SL(3)A × SL(3)B.

τAB = 27 det ρA = 27 | det aAB|2,
(5.13)
where ρA is the reduced density matrix
ρA = TrB|Ψ⟩⟨Ψ|.
(5.14)
The determinant is invariant under SL(3)A × SL(3)B, with aAB transforming as a (3, 3), and under a
discrete duality that interchanges A and B.
5.2.3. Entanglement classiﬁcation
Once again, for subsequent comparison with the D = 5 black hole, we restrict our attention to unnor-
malised states with real coeﬃcients aAB. In this case, one can show [102] that there are three algebraically
independent invariants: τAB, C2 and the norm ⟨Ψ|Ψ⟩, corresponding to the dimension of the space of orbits
R3 × R3
SO(3) × SO(3),
(5.15)
namely 9−6 = 3. Hence, the most general two-qutrit state can be described by just three parameters, which
may conveniently taken to be three real numbers N0, N1, N2:
|Ψ⟩= N0|00⟩+ N1|11⟩+ N2|22⟩.
(5.16)
An SLOCC classiﬁcation of two-qutrit entanglements, depending on the rank of the density matrix, is given
in Table 3.

6. ST U BLACK HOLES
6.1. The STU model
6.1.1. The Lagrangian
An interesting subsector of string compactiﬁcation to four dimensions is provided by the STU model
whose low energy limit is described by N = 2 supergravity coupled to three vector multiplets [124, 19,
125, 15]. One may regard it as a truncation of an N = 2 theory obtained by compactifying the Type IIA
string on Calabi-Yau. Alternatively, one may regard it as a truncation of an N = 4 theory obtained by
compactifying the heterotic string on T 6, where S, T, U correspond to the dilaton/axion, complex K¨ahler
form and complex structure ﬁelds respectively. It exhibits an SL(2, Z)S strong/weak coupling duality and
an SL(2, Z)T × SL(2, Z)U target space duality6. By string/string duality, this is equivalent to a Type IIA
string on K3 × T 2 with S and T exchanging roles [50, 55, 56]. Moreover, by mirror symmetry this is in turn
equivalent to a Type IIB string on the mirror manifold with T and U exchanging roles. Hence the truncated
theory has a combined [SL(2, Z)]3 duality and complete S-T-U triality symmetry [19]. Alternatively, one
may simply start with this N = 2 theory directly as an interesting four-dimensional supergravity in its own
right, as described below.
The model admits extremal black holes solutions carrying four electric and four magnetic charges [19,
126]. Below we organise these 8 charges into the 2 × 2 × 2 hypermatrix and display the S-T-U symmetric
Bogomol’nyi mass spectrum [19].
Associated with this hypermatrix is a hyperdeterminant, discussed in
section 4.3.2, ﬁrst introduced by Cayley in 1845 [22].
The black hole entropy, ﬁrst calculated in [20],
is quartic in the charges and must be invariant under [SL(2, Z)]3 and under triality.
As we shall see,
the important observation for its link to entanglement is that it is given by the square root of Cayley’s
hyperdeterminant.
Consider the three complex scalars axion/dilaton ﬁeld S, the complex K¨ahler form ﬁeld T and the
complex structure ﬁeld U
S = S1 + iS2,
T = T1 + iT2,
U = U1 + iU2.
(6.1)
This complex parametrisation allows for a natural transformation under the various SL(2, Z) symmetries.
The action of SL(2, Z)S is given by
S →aS + b
cS + d,
(6.2)
where a, b, c, d are integers satisfying ad −bc = 1, with similar expressions for SL(2, Z)T and SL(2, Z)U.

and where S = S1 + iS2 = a + ie−η.
Thus T-duality transforms Kaluza-Klein electric charges (FS
3, FS
4) into winding electric charges (FS
1, FS
2)
(and Kaluza-Klein magnetic charges into winding magnetic charges), U-duality transforms the Kaluza-Klein
and winding electric charge of one circle (FS

2) into those of the other (FS
4, FS
1) (and similarly for the
magnetic charges) but S-duality transforms Kaluza-Klein electric charge (FS
3, FS
4) into winding magnetic
charge ( eF 3
S, eF 4
S) (and winding electric charge into Kaluza-Klein magnetic charge). In summary we have
SL(2, Z)T × SL(2, Z)U and T ↔U oﬀ-shell but SL(2, Z)S × SL(2, Z)T × SL(2, Z)U and an S-T-U inter-
change on-shell.
One may also consider the Type IIA action IT US and the Type IIB action IUST obtained by cyclic
permutation of the ﬁelds S, T, U. Finally, one may consider an action [20] where the S, T and U ﬁelds enter
democratically with a prepotential
F = STU,
(6.13)
which oﬀ-shell has the full STU interchange but none of the SL(2, Z).
All four versions are on-shell
equivalent.

This is consistent with the general N = 2 Bogomol’nyi formula [127]. Although all theories have the
same mass spectrum, there is clearly a diﬀerence of interpretation with electrically charged elementary states
in one picture being solitonic monopole or dyon states in the other.
6.1.3. Black hole entropy
The STU model admits extremal black hole solutions satisfying the Bogomol’nyi mass formula. As usual,
their entropy is given by one quarter the area of the event horizon. However, to calculate this area requires
evaluating the mass not with the asymptotic values of the moduli, but with their frozen values on the horizon
which are ﬁxed in terms of the charges [128]. This ensures that the entropy is moduli-independent, as it
should be. The relevant calculation was carried out in [20] for the model with the STU prepotential. The
electric and magnetic charges of that paper are denoted (p0, q0), (p1, q1), (p2, q2), (p3, q3) with O(2, 2) scalar
products
p2 = (p0)2 + (p1)2 −(p2)2 −(p3)2,
q2 = (q0)2 + (q1)2 −(q2)2 −(q3)2,
p · q = (p0q0) + (p1q1) + (p2q2) + (p3q3).
(6.19)
These eight charges may be represented by the cube shown in Figure 4. This charge basis is related to the

Figure 4: The vertices of the hypermatrix cube from Figure 1 are transformed under the dictionary (6.20) to electric and
magnetic charges of the STU black hole. The black hole entropy is related to the hyperdeterminant of this hypermatrix, and
can also be computed from the three pairs of slicings of the cube along its symmetry planes (see section 10.3).

The function D(pΛ, qΛ) is symmetric under transformations: p1 ↔p2 ↔p3 and q1 ↔q2 ↔q3.
7. ST U BLACK HOLE/QUBIT CORRESPONDENCE
7.1. Entropy/entanglement correspondence
The black hole/qubit correspondence now comes about by identifying [3] the black hole charge hyper-
matrix (6.20) with the three qubit hypermatrix (4.31). Then we recognise from (4.33a) that
D(pΛ, qΛ) = −Det a,
(7.1)
and hence, as advertised in the Introduction, the STU black hole entropy and Alice-Bob-Charlie 3-tangle
are related by
S = π
2
√τABC.
(7.2)
Thus Cayley’s hyperdeterminant provides an interesting connection, at least at the level of mathematics,
between string theory and quantum entanglement. Other mathematical similarities are provided by the
division algebras [129] and by twistors [130]. What about physics? The near horizon geometry of the black
holes is AdS2 × S2 and one might expect a relation between the black hole entropy and the entanglement
entropy of the conformal quantum mechanics that lives on the boundary [131], although the nature of this
particular AdS/CFT duality is not well-understood [132]. In any event, the 3-tangle is not the same as the
entropy of entanglement [103]. So the appearance of the Cayley hyperdeterminant in these two diﬀerent
contexts of stringy black hole entropy and three-qubit quantum entanglement remains, for the moment, a
purely mathematical coincidence.
To illustrate more these coincidences we compare some examples of N = 2 black holes with examples of
three-qubit states, following [4].
7.2. Rebits
In the STU stringy black hole context [3, 19, 20, 4] the aABC are integers (corresponding to quantised
charges) and hence the symmetry group is [SL(2, Z)]3 rather than [SL(2, C)]3. However, as discussed by
Levay [5], it is possible within quantum information theory to focus on real qubits, called rebits, for which the
aABC are real [133, 134]. (One diﬀerence remains, however: one may normalise the wavefunction, whereas
for black holes there is no such restriction on the charges aABC). It turns out that there are three reality
classes which can be characterised by the hyperdeterminant
Det a < 0,
(7.3a)
Det a = 0,
(7.3b)
Det a > 0.
(7.3c)
Case (7.3a) corresponds to the non-separable or GHZ class [116], for example,
|Ψ⟩= 1
2(−|000⟩+ |011⟩+ |101⟩+ |110⟩).
(7.4)
43

Case (7.3b) corresponds to the separable (A-B-C, A-BC, B-CA, C-AB) and W classes, for example
|Ψ⟩=
1
√
3(|100⟩+ |010⟩+ |001⟩).
(7.5)
In the string/supergravity interpretation [3], cases (7.3a) and (7.3b) were shown to correspond to BPS
black holes, for which half of the supersymmetry is preserved. Case (7.3a) has non-zero horizon area and
entropy (“large” black holes), and case (7.3b) has vanishing horizon area and entropy (“small” black holes),
at least at the semi-classical level. However, small black holes may acquire a non-zero entropy through
higher order quantum eﬀects. As discussed in section 7.4, this entropy also has a quantum information
interpretation involving bipartite entanglement of the three qubits [4].
Case (7.3c) is also GHZ, for example the above GHZ state (7.4) with a sign ﬂip
|Ψ⟩= 1
2(|000⟩+ |011⟩+ |101⟩+ |110⟩).
(7.6)
The canonical GHZ state
|Ψ⟩=
1
√
2(|111⟩+ |000⟩)
(7.7)
also belongs to case (7.3c).
7.3. Classiﬁcation of N = 2 black holes and three-qubit states
A-B-C states and singly charged black holes: A black hole with just one charge, say q0 as in Figure 5,
has vanishing entropy and corresponds to a completely separable A-B-C state
|Ψ⟩= q0|111⟩,
(7.8)
with
SA = SB = SC = 0,
τABC = 0.
(7.9)
Figure 5: The hypermatrix cube of Figure 4 is restricted to correspond to the state (7.8) by retaining only a single nonzero
entry at the q0 vertex, denoted by the red disc. The state is completely separable and accordingly, the entropy vanishes for
this cube.
Examples of singly charged supersymmetric black hole solutions [135] are provided by the electric
Kaluza-Klein black hole with α = (1, 0, 0, 0) and β = (0, 0, 0, 0); the electric winding black hole with
α = (0, 0, 0, −1) and β = (0, 0, 0, 0); the magnetic Kaluza-Klein black hole with α = (0, 0, 0, 0) and
β = (0, −1, 0, 0); the magnetic winding black hole with α = (0, 0, 0, 0) and β = (0, 0, −1, 0). These are
characterised by a scalar-Maxwell coupling parameter a =
√
3.
By combining these 1-particle states, we may build up 2-, 3- and 4-particle bound states at threshold
[135, 19, 136], characterised by scalar-Maxwell coupling parameter a = 1,1/
√
3 and 0 respectively. The
44

1-, 2- and 3-particle states all yield vanishing contributions to Det a. A non-zero value is obtained for
the 4-particle example, however, which is just the Reissner-Nordstr¨om black hole, as explained below.
One could also consider a black hole with two charges, say q0 and q1 as in Figure 6, having vanishing
entropy and corresponding to another completely separable state
|Ψ⟩= q0|111⟩+ q1|110⟩
(7.10)
also satisfying (7.9).
Figure 6: The hypermatrix cube of Figure 4 is restricted to correspond to the state (7.10) by retaining nonzero entries at the
q0 and q1 vertices, denoted by the red discs. Despite having two nonzero vertices the cube’s entropy vanishes since the state
is again completely separable.
A-BC states and doubly charged black holes: A black hole with just two charges, say q0 and p1 as in
Figure 7, has vanishing entropy and corresponds to a bipartite entangled state
|Ψ⟩= q0|111⟩−p1|001⟩,
(7.11)
with
SA = SB = 4(q0p1)2,
SC = 0,
Det a = 0.
(7.12)
Figure 7: The hypermatrix cube of Figure 4 is restricted to correspond to the state (7.11) by retaining nonzero entries at the
q0 and p1 vertices, denoted by the red discs. In this case the state is bi-separable, so the entropy vanishes once more.
W states and triply charged black holes: A black hole with just three charges, say q0, p1 and p2 as in
Figure 8, has vanishing entropy and corresponds to a W state
|Ψ⟩= q0|111⟩−p1|001⟩−p2|010⟩,
(7.13)
45

with
SA = 4(q0)2((p1)2 + (p2)2),
SB = 4(p1)2((q0)2 + (p2)2),
SC = 4(p2)2((q0)2 + (p1)2),
Det a = 0.
(7.14)
Figure 8: The hypermatrix cube of Figure 4 is restricted to correspond to the state (7.13) by retaining nonzero entries at the
q0, p1 and p2 vertices, denoted by the red discs. The entropy vanishes this time since the cube corresponds to a W state.
GHZ and 4-charge BPS and non-BPS black holes: A black hole with just four charges, say q0, p1,p2
and p3 as in Figure 9, has non-vanishing entropy and corresponds to a GHZ state
|Ψ⟩= q0|111⟩−p1|001⟩−p2|010⟩−p3|100⟩,
(7.15)
with
SA = 4((p3)2 + (q0)2)((p1)2 + (p2)2),
SB = 4((p1)2 + (p3)2)((q0)2 + (p2)2),
SC = 4((p2)2 + (p3)2)((q0)2 + (p1)2),
Det a = −4q0p1p2p3.
(7.16)
This is a large BPS black hole if Det a < 0 and a large non-BPS black hole if Det a > 0.
Figure 9: The hypermatrix cube of Figure 4 is restricted to correspond to the state (7.15) by retaining nonzero entries at
the q0, p1, p2 and p3 vertices, denoted by the red discs. This is a GHZ state exhibiting genuine tripartite entanglement and
accordingly the cube has nonzero entropy. While the previous cubes corresponded to small BPS black holes, this black hole is
large and BPS/non-BPS for Det a < 0/Det a > 0.

GHZ and 2-charge non-BPS black holes: A black hole with just two charges Figure 10, say q0 and p0
as in Figure 10, has non-vanishing entropy and corresponds to a GHZ state
|Ψ⟩= q0|111⟩+ p0|000⟩,
(7.17)
with
SA = SB = SC = 4(p0)2(q0)2,
(7.18)
and
Det a = (p0)2(q0)2.
(7.19)
Since Det a > 0, this describes a non-BPS large black hole [137, 138].
Figure 10: The hypermatrix cube of Figure 4 is restricted to correspond to the state (7.17) by retaining nonzero entries at the
q0 and p0 vertices, denoted by the red discs. Despite having only two nonzero charges the cube has nonvanishing entropy since
the state is GHZ. The corresponding black hole is large and always non-BPS.
7.4. Higher order corrections
The small black holes have a singular horizon with vanishing area and entropy at the classical level, but
may acquire nonvanishing area and entropy due to quantum corrections, characterised by higher derivatives
in the supergravity lagrangian. One can interpret this as consequence of the quantum stretching of the
horizon conjectured by Susskind [139] and Sen [140, 141]. See also [142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147].
Kallosh and Linde [4] have noted that this quantum entropy also admits an interpretation in terms of
qubit entanglement measures. They propose a general formula that correctly reduces to the known special
cases. It is given by
Stotal = π
2
r
τABC + 4c2
3 (CAB + CBC + CCA) + 8K2
3
|Ψ|,
(7.20)
where τABC is the 3-tangle (4.54), CAB is the concurrence (4.51), |Ψ| is the norm and c2 and K are constants
that depend upon the compactiﬁcation.
For completely separable states with only one nonzero charge, this reduces to
S = K
q
2
3|Ψ| = πK
q
2
3|q0|.
(7.21)
For the bipartite and W-states at large values of the charges, the concurrences are much greater than |Ψ|
and the formula reduces to
Stotal = π
rc2
3 (CAB + CBC + CCA)
(7.22)
= 4π
p
|q0(p1 + p2)|.
(7.23)
47

Finally, for the GHZ states the (unnormalised) 3-tangle is much greater than the concurrences and we regain
S = π
2
√τABC.
(7.24)
As with the lowest order black hole/qubit correspondence, there is as yet no underlying physical explanation
for these mathematical coincidences at higher orders.
7.5. Attractors and SLOCC
The extremal black holes of section 2.4 occupy a special place in string theory. They have zero Hawking
temperature and are therefore stable. In the string theory context the microscopic conﬁgurations of these
black holes are explained by D-branes, fundamental strings and other solitonic objects of the theory [87].
The supergravity theories in diﬀerent dimensions are obtained by compactifying the low energy eﬀective
action of string theory on compact manifolds such as a torus or Calabi-Yau. The bosonic ﬁeld content of
these theories consists of the graviton coupled to some gauge and scalar ﬁelds. The extremal black hole
solutions of these supergravity theories are charged under the gauge ﬁelds of the theory. These solutions can
be BPS or non-BPS according as they preserve some or none of the supersymmetries. In the following we
restrict our discussion to static spherically symmetric and asymptotically ﬂat charged extremal black holes.
An interesting phenomenon for extremal black holes is the attractor behaviour. In general the entropy of
the black hole can depend on the values of moduli or scalar ﬁelds but in the case of the extremal black holes
these values are ﬁxed on the horizon in terms of the charges, independent of their asymptotic values. In fact
the scalar ﬁelds describe trajectories in radial coordinate which evolve into the ﬁxed points on the horizon.
This mechanism was ﬁrst observed in N = 2 theory [128, 148, 149] and then was extended to theories with
a larger number of supersymmetries and also to higher dimensions and non-supersymmetric black holes.
In order to explain the attractor mechanism and the idea of moduli ﬁxing we recall some more facts on
the STU model of section 6.1. This theory is explained in terms of the complex scalar ﬁelds S, T and U, a
prepotential F which is written in terms of the scalar ﬁelds as F = STU and four gauge ﬁelds.
Any extended supergravity theory (N > 1) admits an operator called the central charge which commutes
with the other symmetry generators of the theory. The central charge Z of the four-dimensional N = 2
theory coupled to nV vector multiplets can be written in terms of the electric and magnetic charges of the
black hole from the (nV + 1) U(1) gauge ﬁelds of the theory [128, 150, 151]
Z(z, z, p, q) = eK(z,z)/2(XI(z)qI −FI(z)pI),
I ∈{0, . . . , nV },
(7.25)
where
K = −ln i(X
IFI −XIF I),
(7.26)
is the K¨ahler potential and zi, i ∈{1, . . . , nV }, are the scalar ﬁelds. For these theories one can introduce a
symplectic section (XI, FI) which transforms under the symplectic symmetry group Sp(2nV + 2, Z) while
keeping the action invariant.
The XI represent the complex scalar ﬁelds and FI are the derivatives of
the prepotential F deﬁned as FI = ∂F/∂XI.
The prepotential F is subject to two constraints: being
holomorphic (independent of the complex conjugate scalars X
I) and being homogeneous of degree two,
F(λXI) = λ2F(XI). In the case of the STU model we have
zi = Xi
X0 ,
X0 = 1,
(7.27)
where
XI(z) = (1, S, T, U)T ,
FI(z) = (−STU, TU, SU, ST)T .
(7.28)
Note that the index I ∈{1, . . . , 4} is raised and lowered by the metric (+, +, −, −). The complex scalars
S,T and U can be parameterised as in (6.1).
Therefore using (7.27) the K¨ahler potential simpliﬁes to
e−K = −8S2T2U2.
In the Lagrangian of N = 2 supergravity the eﬀective black hole potential is also given in terms of the
central charge by
VBH = |Z(z, p, q)|2 + |DiZ(z, p, q)|2,
(7.29)
48

where Di is the covariant derivative ∂i + ∂iK [149]. As can be seen from this formula the eﬀective potential
depends on the values of the scalar ﬁelds and varies as one moves along the radial coordinate.
Let us now consider a supersymmetric extremal black hole solution of the above theory. The near horizon
metric of the black hole takes the form
ds2 = −
r2
|Z|2
hor
dt2 + |Z|2
hor
r2
dr2 + |Z|2
hordΩ2,
(7.30)
and the entropy of the black hole is given by
SBH = A
4 = π|Z|2
hor.
(7.31)
The attractor mechanism which is responsible for ﬁxing the moduli at the horizon will consequently ﬁx
the entropy [89]. The values of the moduli are given by the critical points of VBH and hence the attractor
equations are obtained by extremising the eﬀective potential:

pI
qJ

= 2ℑ
 
ZL
I
ZM J
!
,
(7.32)
where
LI = eK/2XI,
MJ = eK/2FJ.
(7.33)
Note that for supersymmetric solution DiZ(z, p, q) = 0 and the potential is just proportional to the central
charge. Therefore the critical points of the potential coincide with the critical points of the central charge.
The attractor points are the minima of the potential.
For the BPS solution we have M 2
BPS = |Z|2, the critical points are hence obtained by extremising the
mass formula (6.18), which simpliﬁes to:
M 2
BPS =
1
8S2T2U2
|q0 + q1S + q2T + q3U + p0STU −p1TU −p2SU −p3ST|
2.
(7.34)
Following [5], we now want to demonstrate the similarity between this process of moduli stabilisation
and a quantum information process called a distillation protocol. In order to make this explicit we re-write
the mass formula (6.18) using an SLOCC transformation on the familiar three qubit system of Alice, Bob
and Charlie:
M 2
BPS = ⟨Ψ|(CT
U ⊗BT
T ⊗AT
S)ρ′(CU ⊗BT ⊗AS)|Ψ⟩,
(7.35)
where
|Ψ⟩= aABC|A⟩⊗|B⟩⊗|C⟩,
(7.36)
and where
M−1
S
= AT
SAS,
AS =
1
√S2

S2
0
−S1
−1

,
(7.37)
and similarly M−1
T
= BT
T BT , M−1
U
= CT
UCU. In this equation ρ′ is deﬁned as
ρ′ ≡1
8(1 ⊗1 ⊗1 + σ2 ⊗σ2 ⊗1 + σ2 ⊗1 ⊗σ2 + 1 ⊗σ2 ⊗σ2),
(7.38)
where we use the notation σ2 = −iε. In fact ρ′ is an example of three-qubit mixed state. This relation can
be simpliﬁed further by diagonalising it using the unitary matrix U on each qubit as follows
σ3 = Uσ2U†,
U =
1
√
2
i
1
i
−1

.
(7.39)
49

Therefore the new density matrix which is given by
ρ = UU ⊗UT ⊗US ρ′ U†
U ⊗U†
T ⊗U†
S = 1
2 diag(1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1)
(7.40)
takes the form
ρ = 1
2(|000⟩⟨000| + |111⟩⟨111|).
(7.41)
Using these unitary transformations we obtain a complex representation for M 2
BPS as follows
M 2
BPS = ⟨Ψ|(C†
U ⊗B†
T ⊗A†
S)ρ(CU ⊗BT ⊗AS)|Ψ⟩,
(7.42)
where AS, BT and CU are now scaled SLOCC i.e. GL(2, C) transformations of the form
AS =
1
√2S2

−S
−1
S
1

,
(7.43)
with BT and CU deﬁned similarly. If we deﬁne
|Ψ′⟩≡(CU ⊗BT ⊗AS)|Ψ⟩
(7.44)
the black hole potential can be written in a particularly concise form
VBH = 1
2⟨Ψ′|Ψ′⟩
(7.45)
and the mass formula is simply given by
M 2
BPS = 1
2(|a′
000|2 + |a′
111|2).
(7.46)
The SLOCC transformations are in fact the transformations which map a general three qubit state to the
canonical GHZ form. Comparing this formula with the result obtained in (7.34) one can verify that the
components of Ψ are those given in (6.20). In order to calculate the values of the scalar ﬁelds at the near
horizon limit one can extremise the mass or central charge formula with respect to the complex scalar ﬁelds
S, T and U. This results in the attractor equations (7.32) and the stabilised scalar values are [20]
S = ((p.q) −2p1q1) −i
p
|D|
2(p3p2 −p0q1)
,
T = p2 ¯S −q3
p0 ¯S −p1 ,
U = p3 ¯S −q2
p0 ¯S −p1 ,
(7.47)
where D is given by (6.22). Now one can substitute these frozen or ﬁxed values of the scalar ﬁelds in the
equation for the transformed wavefunction (7.44) to get
|Ψ′⟩=
r
2T2U2
S2
 (p1 −p0S)|000⟩−(p1 −p0S)|111⟩

,
(7.48)
which is of the form of a generalised GHZ state. The expression (7.48) can be multiplied by a phase without
changing the mass;
|Ψ′⟩= |D|1/4  |000⟩+ eiδ|111⟩

,
(7.49)
where
δ = π + 2 arctan
p0S2
p0S1 −p1 .
(7.50)
Interestingly, this result means that the process of ﬁnding the ﬁxed values of the scalar ﬁelds at the horizon
for BPS STU model black holes is equivalent to ﬁnding the canonical form of the corresponding three-qubit
state using complex SLOCC transformations. In other words the process of ﬁnding the frozen values of
the moduli is equivalent to the quantum information theoretic one of performing an optimal set of SLOCC
transformations on the initial three-qubit state with integer amplitudes to arrive at a state of GHZ form [5].
It is important to notice that although the transformed states seem to be complex, one can ﬁnd a basis in
which they are real.

7.6. Bit ﬂip errors and black holes
We now turn our attention to BPS and non-BPS black holes and their relation to the suppression or
non-suppression of bit ﬂip errors, following [9]. We begin with some deﬁnitions. For a qubit system denoted
by |0⟩and |1⟩the phase ﬂip operator Z acts like the Pauli matrix σ3 as
Z|0⟩= |0⟩,
Z|1⟩= −|1⟩.
(7.51)
This is one of the single qubit gates in quantum information theory which leaves the state |0⟩unchanged
but ﬂips the sign of |1⟩. Another useful operator is X, which is the same as Pauli matrix σ1 and is used to
represent bit ﬂips. The action of this bit ﬂip operator is
X|0⟩= |1⟩,
X|1⟩= |0⟩.
(7.52)
In addition, we have the Hadamard gate which is one of the building blocks of quantum circuit theory and is
especially useful in quantum error correction. Quantum error correction is used to protect the information
from errors due to decoherence and other quantum noise over transmission lines. The Hadamard gate acts
on the qubits as
|¯0⟩= H|0⟩=
1
√
2(|0⟩+ |1⟩),
|¯1⟩= H|1⟩=
1
√
2(|0⟩−|1⟩),
(7.53)
where |¯0⟩and |¯1⟩are the Hadamard transformed basis which are, in fact, the eigenvectors of the bit ﬂip
operator X with +1 and −1 eigenvalues, respectively. The matrix representation of the operator H is given
by
H =
1
√
2
1
1
1
−1

.
(7.54)
For the three-qubit system the Hadamard transformations are given by an 8 × 8 matrix deﬁned as H⊗3 =
H ⊗H ⊗H. These transformations are
H⊗3 =

(7.55)
For example the state |110⟩in Hadamard transformed basis reads
|110⟩=
1
√
8 (|000⟩+ |001⟩−|010⟩−|011⟩−|100⟩−|101⟩+ |110⟩+ |111⟩) ,
(7.56)
coming from the sign combination of the sixth row.
Returning now to the BPS and non-BPS black hole solutions, we saw that one can introduce a new
wavefunction |Ψ′⟩given by (7.44) that for the ﬁxed values of the scalar ﬁelds at the horizon takes the form
of a generalised GHZ state (7.49). In general, the coeﬃcients of the state |Ψ′⟩before stabilising the value of
the scalar ﬁelds at the horizon are
a′
000 = −eK/2W(U, T, S),
a′
111 = eK/2W(U, T, S),
a′
110 = −eK/2W(U, T, S),
a′
001 = eK/2W(U, T, S),
a′
101 = −eK/2W(U, T, S),
a′
010 = eK/2W(U, T, S),
a′
011 = −eK/2W(U, T, S),
a′
100 = eK/2W(U, T, S),
(7.57)
51

where we have deﬁned the central charge of (7.25) as Z = eK/2W(S, T, U) , and used the deﬁnition (7.44).
Here the function W is the superpotential. Using the above relations one can easily see that the wavefunction
coeﬃcients satisfy these properties
a′
000 = −a′
111,
a′
110 = −a′
001,
a′
101 = −a′
010,
a′
011 = −a′
100.
(7.58)
To see the relation between quantum error correction and black holes we use the deﬁnition of the covariant
derivative of the superpotential. This is given by DaW = ∂aW + (∂aK)W where a represents the scalar
ﬁelds S, T and U. Using this deﬁnition one can see that for example
DSW(U, T, S) = W(U, T, S)
S −S
.
(7.59)
Therefore if we deﬁne the vielbeins ea
ˆa as
eS
ˆS = i(S −S) = −2S2,
eT
ˆT = i(T −T) = −2T2,
eU
ˆU = i(U −U) = −2U2,
(7.60)
we see that the covariant derivatives of the wavefunction coeﬃcients reduce to
D ˆSa′
111 = ia′
110,
D ˆT a′
111 = ia′
101,
D ˆUa′
111 = ia′
011,
DˆSa′
111 = DˆT a′
111 = D ˆUa′
111 = 0,
(7.61)
where we have used Dˆa = ea
ˆaDa. Note that one can deﬁne the combination (Dˆa −Dˆ¯a)/i which acts on the
state |Ψ′⟩as
1
i (D ˆS −DˆS)|Ψ′⟩= (1 ⊗1 ⊗X)|Ψ′⟩,
etc,
(7.62)
where the operator 1 ⊗1 ⊗X represents a bit ﬂip error (7.52) on the third qubit. Therefore the derivatives
of the central charge, which play a key role in the BPS conditions for the black holes, correspond to the
bit ﬂip errors in quantum information theory. We shall now see this more explicitly for BPS and non-BPS
black hole solutions.
For the BPS extremal black hole solution, the covariant derivatives of the central charge are zero (DaZ =
0) and this guarantees the result (7.49), in which all the wavefunction coeﬃcients are zero at the horizon
except Ψ′000 and Ψ′111. Consider the case in which the charges q0, p1, p2 and p3 are zero, for which (7.49)
reduces to
|Ψ′⟩= i
√
2(−p0q1q2q3)1/4 (|000⟩+ |111⟩) ,
(7.63)
which is explicitly the unnormalised canonical GHZ state. Using DaZ = 0 and (7.62), we conclude that for
the BPS case the GHZ state at the horizon (|Ψ′⟩) is protected from bit ﬂip errors. This means that the
operators 1 ⊗1 ⊗X, 1 ⊗X ⊗1 and X ⊗1 ⊗1 cannot change the BPS state |Ψ′⟩at the horizon. In fact
the BPS conditions precisely suppress the bit ﬂip errors for the three qubit state at the horizon.
The state |Ψ′⟩can also be written in Hadamard transformed basis as
|Ψ′⟩= i(−p0q1q2q3)1/4(|000⟩+ |011⟩+ |101⟩+ |110⟩).
(7.64)
Acting on it with the bit ﬂip operator (here on the third qubit) gives
(1 ⊗1 ⊗X)|Ψ′⟩= i(−p0q1q2q3)1/4(|000⟩−|011⟩−|101⟩+ |110⟩),
(7.65)
telling us that bit ﬂip errors in the normal basis correspond to phase ﬂip errors in the Hadamard basis [9].
The situation changes for non-BPS extremal black holes; the ﬁxed values of the moduli at the horizon
are given by [152, 153]
S = ±i
rq2q3
p0q1
,
T = ±i
rq1q3
p0q2
,
U = ±i
rq1q2
p0q3
,
(7.66)
52

where in this case we have p0q1q2q3 > 0. The sign combinations which do not violate the positivity of the
K¨ahler potential are
{(−, −, −), (−, +, +), (+, −, +), (+, +, −)}.
(7.67)
For example if we let the S, T and U scalars be negative and the charges be all positive (which is consistent
with the positivity of their multiplication), the state can be written as
|Ψ′⟩−−−=
i
√
2(p0q1q2q3)1/4(|000⟩−|001⟩−|010⟩−|011⟩−|100⟩−|101⟩−|110⟩+ |111⟩).
(7.68)
This state can be written in the Hadamard transformed basis as
|Ψ′⟩−−−= −i(p0q1q2q3)1/4(|000⟩−|011⟩−|101⟩−|110⟩).
(7.69)
Comparing this equation with (7.64), the BPS state in Hadamard transformed basis, one can see that (in
addition to the sign diﬀerence of p0q1q2q3) the BPS and non-BPS states may be distinguished by a nontrivial
relative phase between the Hadamard basis vectors. In general, for all sign combinations of the S, T and U
scalars, the state at the horizon takes the form
|Ψ′⟩γβα = −i(p0q1q2q3)1/4{|000⟩+ γ|011⟩+ β|101⟩+ α|110⟩} ,
(7.70)
where α, β and γ are the combinations in (7.67). In the non-BPS case the action of the bit ﬂip errors on
the states at the horizon is
(1 ⊗1 ⊗X)|Ψ′⟩−−−= |Ψ′⟩++−,
(1 ⊗1 ⊗X)|Ψ′⟩−++ = |Ψ′⟩+−+,
etc.
(7.71)
The bit ﬂip operators 1 ⊗1 ⊗X, 1 ⊗X ⊗1 and X ⊗1 ⊗1 transform the states with diﬀerent combinations
of sign into each other. The rule for this transformation is that those labels which are in the same slot as the
bit ﬂip operator X are not changed while the remaining ones are ﬂipped. In contrast to the BPS case, the
bit ﬂip errors transform one non-BPS solution another [9] and the quantum state corresponding to non-BPS
extremal black hole is not protected.
We note that non-BPS state at the horizon (7.68) is an example of a graph-state, which is particularly
important for quantum computation [9].

8. N = 8 BLACK HOLE/QUBIT CORRESPONDENCE
8.1. The N = 8 generalisation
The black holes described by Cayley’s hyperdeterminant are those of N = 2 supergravity coupled to
three vector multiplets, where the symmetry is [SL(2, Z)]3. One might therefore ask whether the black
hole/information theory correspondence could be generalised.
There are three generalisations we might
consider:
1. N = 2 supergravity coupled to l + 1 vector multiplets where the symmetry is SL(2, Z) × SO(l, 2, Z)
and the black holes carry charges belonging to the (2, l + 2) representation (l + 2 electric plus l + 2
magnetic).
2. N = 4 supergravity coupled to m vector multiplets where the symmetry is SL(2, Z) × SO(6, m, Z)
where the black holes carry charges belonging to the (2, 6+m) representation (m+6 electric plus m+6
magnetic).
3. N = 8 supergravity where the symmetry is the non-compact exceptional group E7(7)(Z) and the black
holes carry charges belonging to the fundamental 56-dimensional representation (28 electric plus 28
magnetic). See Table 5
In all three cases there exist quartic invariants akin to Cayley’s hyperdeterminant whose square root
yields the corresponding black hole entropy.
Let us ﬁrst focus on N = 8, where the entropy is given by
S = π
p
|I4|,
(8.1)
where I4 is Cartan’s quartic E7(7) invariant given by
I4 = −tr(xy)2 + 1
4(tr xy)2 −4 (Pf x + Pf y) ,
(8.2)
where xIJ and yIJ are 8 × 8 antisymmetric matrices and Pf is the Pfaﬃan. An alternative expression has
been provided by Cremmer and Julia [62]
I4 = tr( ¯ZZ)2 −1
4(tr ¯ZZ)2 + 4
 Pf Z + Pf ¯Z

(8.4)
and

(8.5)
The matrices of the SO(8) algebra are (γIJ)AB where (I, J) are the 8 vector indices and (A, B) are the 8
spinor indices. The (γIJ)AB matrices can be considered also as (γAB)IJ matrices due to equivalence of the
vector and spinor representations of the SO(8) Lie algebra. The exact relation between the Cartan invariant
in (8.2) and Cremmer-Julia invariant [62] in (8.3) was established in [154, 155]. The quartic invariant I4 of
E7(7) is also related to the octonionic Jordan algebra JO
3 [30] as described in section 10.
In the stringy black hole context, ZAB is the central charge matrix and (x, y) are the quantised charges
of the black hole (28 electric and 28 magnetic). The relation between the entropy of stringy black holes and
the Cartan-Cremmer-Julia E7(7) invariant was established in [156]. The central charge matrix ZAB can be
brought to the canonical basis for the skew-symmetric matrix using an SU(8) transformation:
ZAB =

where zi = ρieiϕi are complex. In this way the number of entries is reduced from 56 to 8. In a systematic
treatment in [157], the meaning of these parameters was clariﬁed. From 4 complex values of zi = ρieiϕi
54

one can remove 3 phases by an SU(8) rotation, but the overall phase cannot be removed; it is related to an
extra parameter in the class of black hole solutions [158, 159]. In this basis, the quartic invariant takes the
form [156]
I4 =

|zi|4 −2

|zi|2|zj|2 + 4 (z1z2z3z4 + ¯z1¯z2¯z3¯z4)

× (ρ1 −ρ2 + ρ3 −ρ4)
× (ρ1 −ρ2 −ρ3 + ρ4)
+ 8ρ1ρ2ρ3ρ4 (cos ϕ −1) .
(8.7)
Therefore a 5-parameter solution is called a generating solution for other black holes in N = 8 supergravity/M-
theory [160, 161].
8.2. E7 and the tripartite entanglement of seven qubits
We have seen that in the case of three qubits, the tripartite entanglement is described by [SL(2, C)]3
and that the entanglement measure is given by Cayley’s hyperdeterminant. If there is to be a quantum
information theoretic interpretation in the N = 8 case, however, it cannot just be random entanglement
of more qubits, because the general n qubit entanglement is described by the group [SL(2, C)]n, which,
even after replacing Z by C, diﬀers from the N = 8 E7 (and also from the N = 4 and N = 2 symmetries
mentioned above, except when n = 3, which correspond to case (1) with l = 2, the case we already know. )
We note, however, that
E7(7)(Z) ⊃[SL(2, Z)]7,
(8.8)
and
E7(C) ⊃[SL(2, C)]7.
(8.9)
We shall now show that the corresponding system in quantum information theory is that of seven qubits
(Alice, Bob, Charlie, Daisy, Emma, Fred and George). However, the larger symmetry requires that they
undergo at most tripartite entanglement of a very speciﬁc kind. The entanglement measure will be given by
the quartic Cartan E7(C) invariant [162, 62, 156, 30].
The crucial ingredient is the observation that E7 contains 7 copies of the single qubit SLOCC group
SL(2) and that the 56 decomposes in a very particular way. We begin by considering the maximal subgroup
SL(2)A × SO(6, 6),
E7(7) ⊃SL(2)A × SO(6, 6),
56
→(2, 12) + (1, 32).
(8.10)
Further decomposing SO(6, 6) in (8.10)
SL(2)A × SO(6, 6) ⊃
SL(2)A
×
SL(2)B
×
SL(2)D
× SO(4, 4),
(2, 12) + (1, 32) →(2, 1, 1, 8v) + (1, 2, 1, 8s) + (1, 1, 2, 8c) + (2, 2, 2, 1).
(8.11)
Further decomposing SO(4, 4),
SL(2)A × SL(2)B × SL(2)D × SO(4, 4)
⊃SL(2)A × SL(2)B × SL(2)D × SO(2, 2) × SO(2, 2)
(2, 2, 2, 1) + (2, 1, 1, 8v) + (1, 2, 1, 8s) + (1, 1, 2, 8c)
→(2, 2, 2, 1, 1) + (2, 1, 1, 4, 1) + (2, 1, 1, 1, 4)
+ (1, 2, 1, 2, 2) + (1, 2, 1, 2, 2) + (1, 1, 2, 2, 2) + (1, 1, 2, 2, 2).
(8.12)
55

Finally, further decomposing each SO(2, 2)
SL(2)A × SL(2)B × SL(2)D × SO(2, 2) × SO(2, 2)
⊃SL(2)A × SL(2)B × SL(2)D × SL(2)C × SL(2)G × SL(2)F × SL(2)E
(2, 2, 2, 1, 1) + (2, 1, 1, 4, 1) + (2, 1, 1, 1, 4)
+ (1, 2, 1, 2, 2) + (1, 2, 1, 2, 2) + (1, 1, 2, 2, 2) + (1, 1, 2, 2, 2)
→(2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1) + (2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1) + (2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2)
+ (1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2) + (1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1) + (1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1) + (1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2).
(8.13)
In summary,
E7(7) ⊃SL(2)A × SL(2)B × SL(2)C × SL(2)D × SL(2)E × SL(2)F × SL(2)G,
(8.14)
and the 56 decomposes as
56 →
(2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1)
+ (1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1)
+ (1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1)
+ (1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2)
+ (2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1)
+ (1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2)
+ (2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2).
(8.15)
An analogous decomposition holds for
E7(C) ⊃[SL(2, C)]7.
(8.16)
Notice that we ﬁnd seven copies of the (2, 2, 2) appearing in the STU model. This translates into seven
copies of the three qubit Hilbert space:
|Ψ⟩56 =
aABD|ABD⟩
+ bBCE |BCE⟩
+ cCDF |CDF ⟩
+ dDEG|DEG⟩
+ eEF A|EF A⟩
+ fF GB|F GB⟩
+ gGAC |GAC⟩.
(8.17)
Note that:
1. Any pair of states has an individual in common
2. Each individual is excluded from four out of the seven states
3. Two given individuals are excluded from two out of the seven states
4. Three given individuals are never excluded
So we have seven qubits (Alice, Bob, Charlie, Daisy, Emma, Fred and George) but where Alice has tripartite
entanglement not only with Bob/Dave but also with Emma/Fred and also Charlie/George, and similarly
for the other six individuals. So, in fact, each person has tripartite entanglement with each of the remaining
three couples. However, as discussed in section 8.8, this 56-dimensional space is not a subspace of the seven
qubit Hilbert space (2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2).
The entanglement may be represented by a heptagon as in Figure 11 with seven vertices A, B, C, D, E, F, G,
and seven triangles
ABD, BCE, CDF, DEG, EFA, FGB, GAC.

Figure 11:
The E7 entanglement diagram corresponding to the decomposition (8.15) and the state (8.17).
Each of the
seven vertices A, B, C, D, E, F, G represents a qubit and each of the seven triangles ABD, BCE, CDF, DEG, EFA, FGB, GAC
describes a tripartite entanglement. As discussed in section 8.3 the oriented triangles correspond to quaternionic cycles in the
multiplication table of imaginary octonions.
Each of the seven states transforms as a (2, 2, 2) under three of the SL(2)’s and are singlets under the
remaining four. Note that from (8.11) we see that the A-B-C triality of section 4.3.2 is linked with the
8v-8s-8c triality of the SO(4, 4) subgroup. Individually, therefore, the tripartite entanglement of each of the
seven states is given by Cayley’s hyperdeterminant. Taken together however, we see from (8.15) that they
transform as a complex 56 of E7(C). Their tripartite entanglement must be given by an expression that is
quartic in the coeﬃcients a, b, c, d, e, f, g and invariant under E7(C). The unique possibility is the Cartan
invariant I4, and so the 3-tangle is given by
τ(ABCDEFG) = 4|I4|.
(8.18)
If the wave-function (8.17) is normalised, then 0 ≤τ(ABCDEFG) ≤1.
8.3. Octonions and the Fano plane
An alternative and very useful picture of the state |Ψ⟩is provided by the Fano plane, as shown in
Figure 12. The Fano plane corresponds to the multiplication table of the imaginary octonions, which we
now brieﬂy discuss.
The algebra of octonions O (with product denoted by juxtaposition) possesses numerous interesting
properties, some of which are notable absences of familiar properties. The reader is referred to [163] for
extensive details including historical notes. Some interesting physical applications may be found in [164,
165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172, 173]. We note that the octonions also make their appearance in a QI
context in [174, 175], but their work seems unrelated to ours.
Typical octonions a, b, c ∈O are:
• 8-tuples of real numbers: a, b, c ∈R8 so that they form an 8-dimensional vector space, with basis
elements e0, . . . , e7.
• non-real: a ̸= a∗, like the complexes. The conjugate •∗: O →O trivially extends the conjugate for
R, C, and H so that basis element eµ is mapped to ηµνeν (with η ≡diag(1, −17)). Under the familiar
partition µ = (0, i), scalar multiples of e0 are real octonions, and scalar multiples of ei are imaginary
octonions.
57

• non-commutative: ab ̸= ba, like the quaternions.
• non-associative: a(bc) ̸= (ab)c, a new property not present in R, C, or H.
• alternative - meaning that the subalgebra generated by any two elements is associative, or equiv-
alently, the associator [•, •, •] : O3 →O, (a, b, c) 7→a(bc) −(ab)c is alternating:
[a1, a2, a3] =
(−)π[aπ(1), aπ(2), aπ(3)] with π ∈S3.
• a division algebra, so that when a product of octonions is zero one of the multiplied octonions must
have been zero: ab = 0 ⇒a = 0 ∧b = 0. They share this property with R, C, H, and no other
algebras.
• normed: |ab| = |a||b|, which implies the division algebra property.
Like the conjugate, the norm
| • | : O →R is also a trivial extension of the norm for the other division algebras: a 7→a∗a.
Clearly the octonions are closely related to the other division algebras, and indeed octonionic multiplication
can be deﬁned in terms of multiplication in these algebras, just as H can be deﬁned in terms of C, which can
in turn be deﬁned through R. In this context it is instructive to classify R, C, H, and O as ∗-algebras. Such
algebras are characterised by the possession of a real-linear conjugation map that is involutive ((a∗)∗≡a)
and an anti-automorphism ((ab)∗≡b∗a∗).
If we denote the imaginary octonions by ei where i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, the structure constants Cijk are
deﬁned by
eiej = −δij + Cijkek.
(8.19)
We now establish some useful identities. First
CpmkCqkn + CqmkCpkn = δpmδqn + δpnδqm −2δpqδmn.
(8.20)
Following [176] we deﬁne the “Jacobian” Cijkl
[ei, [ej, ek]] + [ek, [ei, ej]] + [ej, [ek, ei]]
= 4(CjkmCimn + CijmCkmn + CkimCjmn)en
≡3Cijklel,
(8.21)
where Cijkl satisﬁes
Cijkl = 1
6εijklmnpCmnp,
(8.22)
and
Cijkl = −CmijCmkl −δilδjk + δikδjl.
(8.23)
That the Fano plane corresponds to the multiplication table of the imaginary octonions may be seen in
Table 9.
The Fano plane multiplication, may be represented numerically as an 8 × 8 array as in Table 23.

Figure 12: The Fano plane is a projective plane with seven points and seven lines (the circle counts as a line). We may associate
it to the state (8.17) by interpreting the points as the seven qubits A-G and the lines as the seven tripartite entanglements.
This is consistent as there are three points on every line and three lines through every point. If the plane is oriented like ours,
one may use the directed lines to read oﬀthe multiplication table of imaginary octonions (Table 9).

Table 10: From Table 9 one can read oﬀwhich components of the Fano structure constants Cijk are nonzero. Using (8.22) one
then obtains the associator coeﬃcients Clmno.
The non-vanishing independent components of the octonionic structure constants Cijk and their duals Clmno
are then given in Table 10.
Note that in the Fano plane there are seven lines a, b, c, d, e, f, g, and seven vertices A, B, C, D, E, F, G.
Each line passes through three vertices, and three lines meet at a vertex. This means one can deﬁne a
dual Fano Plane with lines A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and vertices a, b, c, d, e, f, g. See Figure 13. Another way to
understand the appearance of the dual Fano plane is to recognise the seven rows in (8.15) as the lines of
the Fano plane and the seven columns as vertices as in Table 11. The dual Fano plane corresponds to the
transpose of this matrix and leads to a dual state
|eΨ⟩56 =
Aaeg|aeg⟩
+ Bbfa|bfa⟩
+ Ccgb|cg b⟩
+ Ddac|dac⟩
+ Eebd|ebd⟩

(8.24)
The dual Fano plane corresponds to the multiplication table of the imaginary octonions given in Table 12
and may be represented numerically as an 8 × 8 array as in Table 24.
The non-vanishing independent
components of the octonionic structure constants cijk and their duals clmno are then given by Table 13.

Figure 13: Like the Fano plane of Figure 12 the dual Fano plane has seven points and seven lines, but this time the plane
is associated with the dual state (8.24) interpreting the points as the seven tripartite entanglements and the lines as the
seven qubits. The construction of the dual plane is expedited by Table 11. The orientation of our plane provides another
multiplication table for imaginary octonions (Table 12).

Table 11: The seven terms in decomposition (8.15) may be written in a grid such that Fano lines and vertices are rows and
columns. This permits easy identiﬁcation of the dual lines and vertices, which are simply given by columns and rows.
8.4. Decomposition of I4
To understand better the entanglement we note that, as a result of (8.15), Cartan’s invariant contains
not one Cayley hyperdeterminant but seven. It may be written as the sum of seven terms each of which is
invariant under [SL(2)]3 plus cross terms. To see this, denote a 2 in one of the seven entries in (8.15) by
A, B, C, D, E, F, G. So we may rewrite (8.15) as
56 = (ABD) + (BCE) + (CDF) + (DEG) + (EFA) + (FGB) + (GAC),
(8.25)
or symbolically
56 = a + b + c + d + e + f + g.

Table 14: The aeg quaternionic multiplication table is obtained by selecting the aeg quaternionic cycle from Table 12.
Having understood the analogy between N = 8 black holes and the tripartite entanglement of seven
qubits using E7(7), we may now ﬁnd the analogy in the N = 4 case using SL(2) × SO(6, 6) and the N = 2
case using SL(2) × SO(2, 2).
First we recall the decomposition (8.10) of the fundamental 56-dimensional representation of E7(7) under
its maximal subgroup. The N = 4 subsector consists of just the 24 states belonging to the (2, 12)
|Ψ⟩= aABD|ABD⟩+ eEF A|EFA⟩+ gGAC|GAC⟩.
(8.31)
So only Alice talks to all the others. This is described by just those three lines passing through A in the
Fano plane or the aeg line in the dual Fano plane. Then the equation analogous to (8.25) is
(2, 12) = (ABD) + (EFA) + (GAC) = a + e + g,
(8.32)
and the corresponding quartic invariant, I4, reduces to the singlet in (2, 12) × (2, 12) × (2, 12) × (2, 12)
I4 ∼a4 + e4 + g4 + 2[e2g2 + g2a2 + a2e2].
(8.33)
If we identify the 24 numbers (aABD, eEF A, gGAC) with (P µ, Qν) with µ, ν = 0, . . . , 11 in a way analogous
to (4.38) this becomes the SL(2) × SO(6, 6) invariant [19, 158, 159]
I4 = P 2Q2 −(P · Q)2.
(8.34)
So
I4 = Iaeg ≡det(γ1(a) + γ2(g) + γ3(e)).
(8.35)
This reduction from N = 8 to N = 4 corresponds to a reduction from the imaginary octonions of Table 12
to the imaginary quaternions of Table 14.
This suggest that I4 of (8.34) may be written as Cayley’s
hyperdeterminant over the imaginary quaternions, and this is indeed the case, as shown in section 11.2.
From a stringy point of view, this subsector describes just the NS-NS charges.
A diﬀerent subsector which excludes Alice is obtained by keeping just the (1, 32) in (8.10), This is
described by just those four lines not passing through A in the Fano plane or the bcdf quadrangle in the
dual Fano plane. From a stringy point of view, this subsector describes just the R-R charges.
(1, 32) = (BCE) + (CDF) + (DEG) + (FGB) = b + c + d + f,
(8.36)
62

and the corresponding quartic invariant, I4, reduces to the singlet in (1, 32) × (1, 32) × (1, 32) × (1, 32)
I4 ∼b4 + c4 + d4 + f 4 + 2[b2c2 + c2d2 + d2e2 + d2f 2 + c2f 2 + f 2b2] + 8bcdf.
(8.37)
This is does not correspond to any N = 4 black hole but rather to an N = 8 black hole with only the R-R
charges switched on.
For N = 2, as may be seen from (8.11), we only have the [SL(2)]3 subgroup of the STU model where
there are only 8 states
|Ψ⟩= aABD|ABD⟩.
(8.38)
This is described by just the ABD line in the Fano plane or the a vertex in the dual Fano plane. This is
simply the usual tripartite entanglement, for which
(2, 2, 2) = (ABD) = a,
(8.39)
and the corresponding quartic invariant
I4 ∼a4,
(8.40)
is just Cayley’s hyperdeterminant
I4 = −Det a.
(8.41)
8.6. E7 as an O-graded algebra
As we have seen, the seven qubit interpretation relies on the decomposition of the 56 under E7(7) ⊃
[SL(2)]7 and the Fano plane [6, 7]. Independently, similar observations were being made in pure mathematics,
namely the remarkable fact that E7 has a natural structure of an O-graded algebra, compatible with its
action on the minimal 56-dimensional representation [28, 29].
Consider the points
i ∈{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7},
(8.42)
and lines
l ∈{124, 235, 346, 457, 561, 672, 713}
(8.43)
of the Fano plane and attach to each line a two-dimensional vector space Al. Then we may describe the
algebra of E7 and the 56 as
e7 = ×l sl(Al)e0 ⊕L
1≤i≤7
N
i/∈l Al

ei,
56 = L
1≤i≤7
N
i∈l Al

ei.
(8.44)
Alternatively, consider the complementary quadrangles of the Fano plane
I ∈{3457, 4561, 5672, 6713, 7124, 1235, 2346},
(8.45)
then
e7 = ×7
i=1sl(Ai) ⊕
M
(ijkl)∈I
Ai ⊗Aj ⊗Ak ⊗Al.
(8.46)
The same formulae hold good if we go to the dual Fano plane by swapping the roles of points and lines.
Note that there is a quaternionic analogue of this construction where, instead of the Fano plane, we
consider just three of its lines. This describes the N = 4 subsector discussed above.
We shall return to (8.46) in section 10.2.1.
In fact, a similar construction applies to the algebra of E8 [28]:
e8 = ×7
i=0sl(Ai) ⊕
M
(ijkl)∈I
Ai ⊗Aj ⊗Ak ⊗Al,
(8.47)
63

where I now runs over the 14 quadruples
I ∈{3457, 4561, 5672, 6713, 7124, 1235, 2346, 0124, 0235, 0346, 0457, 0561, 0672, 0713},
(8.48)
or their duals appearing in Table 22.
There is a diﬀerence, however, since the fundamental 248 of E8 is also the adjoint. So the 224-dimensional
Hilbert space describing the 4-way entanglement of 8-qubits does not transform as a linear representation of
E8 but rather as a nonlinear realisation, namely as the coset E8/[SL(2)]8. Lacking at the moment a good
application of this coset construction within quantum information theory, we relegate it to Appendix B.
8.7. Classiﬁcation of N = 8 black holes and seven-qubit states
In the N = 8 theory, “large” and “small” black holes are classiﬁed by the sign of I4:
I4 > 0,
(8.49a)
I4 = 0,
(8.49b)
I4 < 0.
(8.49c)
Once again, non-zero I4 corresponds to large black holes, which are BPS for I4 > 0 and non-BPS for I4 < 0,
and vanishing I4 corresponds to small black holes. However, in contrast to N = 2, case (8.49a) requires that
only 1/8 of the supersymmetry is preserved, while we may have 1/8, 1/4 or 1/2 for case (8.49b).
The large black hole solutions can be found [177] by solving the N = 8 classical attractor equations [128]
when at the attractor value the ZAB matrix, in normal form, becomes
ZAB =




(8.50)
for positive I4 and
ZAB = eiπ/4|Z|

(8.51)
for negative I4. These matrices exhibit the maximal compact symmetries SU(6) × SU(2) and USp(8) for
the positive and negative I4, respectively.
If the phase in (8.7) vanishes (which is the case if the conﬁguration preserves at least 1/4 supersymmetry
[157]), I4 of (8.7) becomes
I4 = s1s2s3s4,
(8.52)
where si are given by the ρi of (8.7)
s1 = ρ1 + ρ2 + ρ3 + ρ4,
s2 = ρ1 + ρ2 −ρ3 −ρ4,
s3 = ρ1 −ρ2 + ρ3 −ρ4,
s4 = ρ1 −ρ2 −ρ3 + ρ4,
(8.53)
and we order the si so that s1 ≥s2 ≥s3 ≥|s4|. The charge orbits [30, 157, 178] for the black holes depend
on the number of unbroken supersymmetries or the number of vanishing eigenvalues as in Table 16.
For N = 8, as for N = 2, the large black holes correspond to the two classes of GHZ-type (entangled)
states and small black holes to the separable or W class. As we shall describe in section 10.2.2, one way
of obtaining such states is to go the canonical basis (10.19) where the Cartan invariant reduces to Cayley’s
hyperdeterminant. Then the A-B-C, A-BC, W and GHZ states are just those of the STU model whose
black hole interpretation was given already in section 7.3. The result is shown in Table 16. Note, however,

eigenvalues and I4, as well as the number of preserved supersymmetries.
that by embedding the STU model in the N = 8 theory, we obtain ﬁner supersymmetry and charge orbit
correspondences than those of the N = 2 STU theory of Table 15. The orbits for the large N = 2 black
holes were previously found in [30, 150]; those of the small black holes are new. The corresponding SLOCC
orbits may be found in [17].
Alternatively, having succeeded in writing the Cartan invariant in terms of a, b, c, d, e, f, g in (8.27) we
can now look for maximally entangled states in the N = 4 subsector and the full N = 8 theory. Let us ﬁrst
recall the normalised GHZ state in the N = 2 subsector
|Ψ⟩=
1
√
2 (|111⟩+ |000⟩) .
(8.54)
It is obviously entangled since if Alice measures 0, Bob and Charlie must also measure 0. This is conﬁrmed
by calculating the 3-tangle
γ1(a) =

2(a0a6 −a2a4)
a0a7 −a2a5 + a1a6 −a3a4
a0a7 −a2a5 + a1a6 −a3a4
2(a1a7 −a3a5)

,
(8.55)
and
a0 = a7 =
1
√
2,
(8.56)
so
γ1(a) =
0
1
2
1
2
0

,
(8.57)
Moreover it is maximally entangled since
τ = 4| det γa| = 1.
(8.58)
Now consider the N = 4 subsector state with
a0 = a7 = e0 = e7 = g0 = g7 =
1
√
6,
(8.59)
γ1(a) + γ2(g) + γ3(e) =

0
1
6 + 1
6 + 1
6
1
6 + 1
6 + 1
6
0

,
(8.60)
τ = 4| det(γ1(a) + γ2(g) + γ3(e))| = 1,
(8.61)
65

also. Going to the full N = 8 sector, consider
a0 = a7 = b0 = b7 = c0 = c7 = d0 = d7 = e0 = e7 = f0 = f7 = g0 = g7 =
1
√
14,
(8.62)
we ﬁnd 7 non-vanishing contributions of the a4 type, and 21 of the a2b2 type while the abce type terms all
vanish. Hence τ = 1 once more. Another example involving the abce terms is to keep
a7 = a1 = a2 = a4 =
1
√
28,
(8.63)
and similarly for b, c, d, e, f, g when we again ﬁnd τ = 1. The choice
a7 = g1 = b1 = d1 = 1
2
(8.64)
involves only the agbd term and also yields τ = 1.
8.8. Seven qutrit interpretation
We note that the 56-dimensional Hilbert space given in Equation 8.17 is not a subspace of the usual
27-dimensional seven-qubit Hilbert space given by (2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2), but rather a direct sum of seven 23-
dimensional three-qubit Hilbert spaces (2, 2, 2):
(2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1)
+ (1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1)
+ (1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1)
+ (1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2)
+ (2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1)
+ (1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2)
+ (2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2).
(8.65)
This raises an ambiguity about the terminology tripartite entanglement of seven qubits. The state corre-
sponding to the usual 27-dimensional seven-qubit Hilbert space (2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2) is
|Ψ⟩= aABCDEF G|ABCDEFG⟩,
(8.66)
and one meaning of tripartite entanglement, ABD say, would be that given by the reduced density matrix
ρABD = TrCEF G|Ψ⟩⟨Ψ|.
(8.67)
So it is important to note that this is clearly diﬀerent from the meaning we have adopted for seven qubits
elsewhere in this Report.
The doublets in (8.65) are interpreted as qubits, but what about the singlets? A natural explanation for
the origin of the singlets is to embed each two-valued qubit in a three-valued qutrit and note that under
SL(3) →SL(2)
(8.68)
we have
3 →2 + 1.
(8.69)
The seven qutrit system (Alice, Bob, Charlie, Daisy, Emma, Fred and George) is described by the state
|Ψ⟩= a ˆ
A ˆ
B ˆ
C ˆ
D ˆ
E ˆ
F ˆ
G| ˆA ˆB ˆC ˆD ˆE ˆF ˆG⟩,
(8.70)
where ˆA = 0, 1, 2, and the Hilbert space has dimension 37 = 2, 187. ˆa ˆ
A ˆ
B ˆ
C ˆ
D ˆ
E ˆ
F ˆ
G transforms as a (3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3)
of SL(3)A × SL(3)B × SL(3)C × SL(3)D × SL(3)E × SL(3)F × SL(3)G. Under
SL(3)A × SL(3)B × SL(3)C × SL(3)D × SL(3)E × SL(3)F × SL(3)G
⊃SL(2)A × SL(2)B × SL(2)C × SL(2)D × SL(2)E × SL(2)F × SL(2)G,
(8.71)
66

we have
(3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3) →
1 term like (2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2)
+ 7 terms like (2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1)
+ 21 terms like (2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1)
+ 35 terms like (2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1)
+ 35 terms like (2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1)
+ 21 terms like (2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1)
+ 7 terms like (2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1)
+ 1 term like (1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1)
,
(8.72)
which contains (8.65) as a subspace. Denoting doublets by A = 0, 1 and singlets by •, we have
|Ψ⟩56 =
aAB•D•••|AB •D • • •⟩
+ b•BC•E••|•BC • E • •⟩
+ c••CD•F •|• • CD •F •⟩
+ d•••DE•G|• • •DE •G⟩

+ f•B•••F G|•B • • •FG⟩
+ gA•C•••G|A • C • • •G⟩,
(8.73)
which we abbreviate by Equation 8.17.
So the Fano plane entanglement we have described ﬁts within
conventional quantum information theory, but we have discovered a hidden E7 symmetry of this special
56-dimensional subspace.
In the notation ˆA = 0, 1, 2 the 56 states are

|1202221⟩
|1212220⟩
|1212221⟩.
(8.74)
To get a ﬂavour of the qutrit entanglement, we restrict to generalisations of |000⟩+ |111⟩GHZ states
and get
|0020222⟩
|1121222⟩
|2002022⟩
|2112122⟩

|0202220⟩
|1212221⟩.
(8.75)
Suitably normalised, this generalised GHZ state yields Cartan τ = 1 and is maximally entangled.
Suppose Alice measures 0:
|0020222⟩
|0222002⟩
|0202220⟩,
(8.76)
(which incidentally reduces to the a, e, g subsector) then Bob can measure 0:
|0020222⟩,
(8.77)
67

in which case Charlie, Daisy, Emma, Fred and George can only measure 2,0,2,2,2, respectively or Bob can
measure 2
|0222002⟩
|0202220⟩,
(8.78)
then Charlie can measure 0:
|0202220⟩,
(8.79)
or 2:
|0222002⟩,
(8.80)
and so on. We may tabulate the various possibilities as in Table 17

9. BLACK HOLES AND THE FREUDENTHAL TRIPLE SYSTEM
For the N = 8 black hole entropy interpretation, we considered I4 in a form exhibiting manifest SO(8)
symmetry, the 56 charges lying in what we refer to as the Cartan basis, that is, the pair of 8×8 antisymmetric
matrices, xIJ and yIJ. For the QI interpretation, we also considered I4 as a quartic polynomial in the 56
coeﬃcients specifying the special seven-qubit state (8.17) with manifest [SL(2)]7 symmetry. We shall refer
to this representation as the Fano basis. There is actually a third possible representation of the 56 charges,
the Freudenthal triple system (FTS) [179, 180, 165, 181, 182], which we investigate now.
It is well known that the FTS may be used as a representation of the black hole charge vector space
of N = 8 supergravity in D = 4 [30]. Indeed, for N = 8 supergravity in D = 5 there is a one-to-one
correspondence between the black hole charge vector space and the cubic Jordan algebra of 3 × 3 hermitian
matrices deﬁned over the split octonions, which forms a representation of the fundamental 27 of E6(6), the
U-duality group in this case. Reducing down to D = 4 the black hole charge vector space is given by the
FTS deﬁned over the D = 5 Jordan algebra which forms a representation of the fundamental 56 of E7(7).
We shall refer to this representation as the Freudenthal basis, which will facilitate a better understanding
of the E7(7) invariant entanglement and its relationship with the black hole charges and entropy.
Interestingly, the N = 2 STU model may also be considered from this point of view, giving a diﬀerent
picture of the results already presented, on both the black hole and QI sides of the equation [17].
The Jordan algebra approach presents a possible alternative interpretation of the black hole/qutrit
correspondence in D = 5, considered in section 13, allowing one to extend the analogy to D = 6. This
alternative is inspired by the observation that the N = 2 “Magic” supergravity models are themselves
intimately related to division algebras, Jordan algebras and the FTS [183, 184, 185, 157, 30]. However, let
us postpone these considerations for the moment (we will return to them in section 10.3 and section 13.3)
while we introduce the necessary material and make some observations concerning the properties of the
black hole entropy and qubit entanglement from this FTS perspective.
9.1. Composition algebras
The Jordan algebras of particular importance to supergravity are, for the most part, conveniently de-
scribed in terms of Hermitian matrices deﬁned over certain composition algebras. An algebra A, which
need not be associative, deﬁned over a ground ﬁeld F, is said to be composition if it comes equipped with
a non-degenerate quadratic norm, n : A →F, satisfying,
n(yx) = n(x)n(y)
∀x, y ∈A.
(9.1)
All such algebras are alternative, x2y = x(xy) and (xy)x = x(yx) for all x, y ∈A [186]. Note, the associator,
deﬁned as [x, y, z] = (xy)z −x(yz) in direct analogy with the commutator, is an alternating function of its
arguments precisely when A is alternative.
An algebra is said to be division if it contains no zero divisors, that is,
xy = 0
⇒
x = 0
or
y = 0.
(9.2)
This condition holds for any composition algebra with positive deﬁnite norm, in which case it is referred to
as a nicely normed division algebra. The only four possible nicely normed division algebras are R, C, H and
O, a celebrated result due to Hurwitz [187, 165], cf. section 8.3. The norm in each of these cases is given by
n(x) = x¯x, where the involution x →¯x is just given by complex conjugation. We shall also be concerned
with their split cousins, Cs, Hs and Os, which have a split signature norm. Consequently, the norm is not
positive deﬁnite and, while still composition, it is no longer division.
9.2. Jordan algebras
Jordan algebras were originally introduced in [188] as a possible generalisation of the orthodox formula-
tion of quantum mechanics in the hope of addressing certain diﬃculties in fundamental physics, particularly
in the relativistic regime. We will come to the Jordan formulation of quantum mechanics in section 13.3.2.
69

However, they are interesting objects in their own right and an expansive literature on the subject has
developed over the years. See [189, 190] for a comprehensive account. Their intimate relationship with the
exceptional Lie groups is of central importance in their applications to string theory and supergravity.
A vector space, deﬁned over a ground ﬁeld F, equipped with a bilinear product satisfying,
x ◦y = y ◦x;
x2 ◦(x ◦y) = x ◦(x2 ◦y)
∀x, y ∈J,
(9.3)
is a Jordan algebra J. An obvious example is given by the set of real matrices with Jordan product deﬁned
as x ◦y = 1
2(xy + yx). More generally, this deﬁnition of the Jordan product may be used to construct a
Jordan algebra starting from any associative algebra.
Any algebra is said to be formally real if,
x2 + y2 + z2 . . . = 0
=⇒
x = y = z = . . . = 0.
(9.4)
Assuming that a given Jordan algebra is formally real it can be shown that the Jordan identity (9.3) is
equivalent to power associativity [179],
xm ◦xn = x(m+n).
(9.5)
This is signiﬁcant when considering the application of Jordan algebras to quantum mechanics providing
some physical motivation for the Jordan identity as will be discussed in section 13.3.2.
The full classiﬁcation of all formally real Jordan algebras was completed in [179]. There are four inﬁnite
sequences of simple Jordan algebras and one exceptional case. (A Jordan algebra is simple if it contains
no proper ideals. All Jordan algebras may be decomposed into a direct sum of simple Jordan algebras.)
Three of the inﬁnite sequences are given by the sets JA
n of n × n Hermitian matrices deﬁned over the
three associative division algebras, A = R, C or H. The Jordan product in these cases is simply given by
x ◦y = 1
2(xy + yx), where xy denotes conventional matrix multiplication. The fourth is given by R ⊕Qn,
where Qn is a n-dimensional real vector space. The one exceptional simple Jordan algebra is given by JO
3 ,
the set of 3 × 3 Hermitian matrices deﬁned over the octonions.
However, we will generally be concerned with the larger class of cubic Jordan algebras which need not
be formally real. For example, JOs
3 , the set of 3 × 3 Hermitian matrices deﬁned over the split octonions, is
not formally real but none the less underpins N = 8 supergravity.
9.3. The Freudenthal-Springer-Tits construction of cubic Jordan algebras
In [191, 181] it was shown how to construct a cubic Jordan algebra from any vector space equipped
with a cubic form satisfying certain conditions described below. We sketch this construction here, following
closely the conventions of [182].
Let V be a vector space, deﬁned over a ground ﬁeld F, equipped with both a cubic norm, N : V →F,
satisfying N(λx) = λ3N(x),
∀λ ∈F, x ∈V , and a base point c ∈V such that N(c) = 1. If N(x, y, z),
referred to as the full linearisation of N, deﬁned by
N(x, y, z) := 1
6
 N(x + y + z) −N(x + y) −N(x + z) −N(y + z) + N(x) + N(y) + N(z)

(9.6)
is trilinear then one may deﬁne the following four maps,
1. The trace,
Tr : V →F,
Tr(x) = 3N(c, c, x),
(9.7a)
2. A quadratic map,
S : V →F,
S(x) = 3N(x, x, c),
(9.7b)
3. A bilinear map,
S : V × V →F,
S(x, y) = 6N(x, y, c),
(9.7c)
4. A trace bilinear form,
Tr : V × V →F,
Tr(x, y) = Tr(x) Tr(y) −S(x, y).
(9.7d)
70

N is said to be Jordan cubic if,
1. The trace bilinear form (9.7d) is non-degenerate.
2. The quadratic adjoint map, #: J →J, uniquely deﬁned by Tr(x#, y) = 3N(x, x, y), satisﬁes
(x#)# = N(x)x,
∀x ∈J.
(9.8)
A cubic Jordan algebra with multiplicative identity 1 = c may be derived from any such vector space
with a Jordan cubic form by deﬁning the Jordan product,
x ◦y = 1
2
 x × y + Tr(x)y + Tr(y)x −S(x, y)1

,
(9.9)
where, x × y is the linearisation of the quadratic adjoint,
x × y = (x + y)# −x# −y#.
(9.10)
There are three groups, of particular importance, related to cubic Jordan algebras. The set of automor-
phisms, Aut(J), is composed of all linear transformations on J that preserve the Jordan product,
x ◦y = z
=⇒
g(x) ◦g(y) = g(z),
∀g ∈Aut(J).
(9.11)
The Lie algebra of Aut(J) is given by the set of derivations, Der(J), that is, all linear maps D : J →J
satisfying the Leibniz rule,
D(x ◦y) = D(x) ◦y + x ◦D(y).
(9.12)
The structure group, Str(J), is composed of all linear bijections on J that leave the cubic norm N invariant
up to a ﬁxed scalar factor,
N(g(x)) = λN(x),
∀g ∈Str(J).
(9.13)
Finally, the reduced structure group Str0(J) leaves the cubic norm invariant and therefore consists of those
elements in Str(J) for which λ = 1 [192]. The U-duality group of any D = 5 supergravity with charge
representation J is given by Str0(J) [183].
Further, the scalar ﬁelds of these theories parameterise the
symmetric coset spaces Str0(J)/ Aut(J) and the U-duality charge vector orbits are given by Str0(J)/H,
where H is some subgroup of Aut(J) [30].
The usual concept of matrix rank may be generalised to cubic Jordan algebras and is invariant under
both Str(J) and Str0(J) [193, 182]. Explicitly, for any element x ∈J we have,
Rank x = 3
iﬀ
N(x) ̸= 0,
Rank x = 2
iﬀ
N(x) = 0
and
x# ̸= 0,
Rank x = 1
iﬀ
x# = 0
and
x ̸= 0,
Rank x = 0
iﬀ
x = 0.
(9.14)
Note, when using the alternative interpretation described in section 13.3, these classiﬁcations correspond
directly to the diﬀerent classes of entanglement of two qutrits under SLOCC, as shown in Table 3, since one
may consider the reduced density matrices, ρA and ρB, as element of JC
3 .
9.4. D = 5 black strings/holes and Jordan algebras
The elements of the cubic Jordan algebras JA
3 of degree three are 3 × 3 hermitian real A matrices:
J3(P) =


p1
Pv
Ps
Pv
p2
Pc
Ps
Pc
p3

,
where
pi ∈R
and
Ps,c,v ∈A,
(9.15)
71

where A is one of the normed division algebras, R, C, H, O or the split composition algebras, Cs, Hs, Os.
For two elements X and Y in JA
3 the Jordan product is given by X ◦Y = 1
2(XY + Y X), where XY is just
the conventional matrix product. The bilinear trace form and quadratic adjoint are given respectively by,
Tr(X, Y ) = Tr(X ◦Y ),
(9.16)
and
X# = X2 −tr(X)X + 1
2[(tr X)2 −tr(X2)]1.
(9.17)
The cubic norm N(J3(P)) is given by the appropriate generalisation of the standard matrix determinant,
N = p1p2p3 −(p1PsP s + p2PcP c + p3PvP v) + PsPcPv + P sP cP v ≡I3(P),
(9.18)
which just reduces to the conventional determinant deﬁnition when A = R, C.
The elements J3(P) ∈JA
3 transform as the (3 dim A + 3) dimensional representation of the norm pre-
serving group, Str0(JA
3 ) = SL(3, A). For A = R, C, H, O (dim A = 1, 2, 4, 8, respectively) JA
3 transforms
as the 6, 9, 15, 27 of SL(3, R), SL(3, C), SU ∗(6), E6(−26), respectively. These are the symmetries of
the magic N = 2, D = 5 supergravities [185, 183, 184] and the magnetic black string charges fall into the
corresponding representations. The octonionic case corresponds to the decomposition
E6(−26) ⊃SO(8),
(9.19)
under which
27 →1 + 1 + 1 + 8s + 8c + 8v,
(9.20)
where p1, p2, p3 are the singlets and Ps, Pc, Pv are the 8s, 8c, 8v. The octonions may be written
P x = P 0
x + P 1
xe1 + P 2
xe2 + P 3
xe3 + P 4
xe4 + P 5
xe5 + P 6
xe6 + P 7

(9.21)
with norm

x = P 0

2.
(9.22)
The N = 8 case then also follows [30] by using the split octonions in JA
3 , in which case Str0(JOs
3 ) = E6(6),
the N = 8 U-duality group. The split octonions have norm
P xP
x = P 0

(9.23)
There we have
E6(6) ⊃SO(4, 4),
(9.24)
under which
27 →1 + 1 + 1 + 8s + 8c + 8v.
(9.25)
In all cases the black string entropy is
S = π
p
|I3(P)|,
(9.26)
where I3(P) is the cubic invariant N(J3(P)) as given in (9.18).
For the electric black holes, we have the conjugate Jordan matrix
J3(Q) =


q1
Qv
Qs
Qv
q2
Qc
Qs
Qc


,
(9.27)
and the entropy is
S = π

|I3(Q)|.

9.4.1. U-duality orbits and Jordan algebras
Any element J3(P) ∈JA
3 , for A = R, C, H, O, may be diagonalised using a Aut(JA
3 ) transformation. In
the exceptional octonionic case this corresponds to a F4 transformation, as was shown explicitly in [194].
When A = C this operation is related to the Schmidt decomposition of a two-qutrit system. For a detailed
discussion of the D = 5 magic supergravity charge orbits see [30]. For the N = 8 case E6(6) acts transitively
on the classes of elements of rank 1 or 2 (9.14), the small black holes. For large black holes, those with
non-vanishing entropy corresponding to rank 4 elements of JOs
3 , E6(6) acts transitively on elements of a
given entropy (cubic norm) I3 [193, 182]. Any element J3(P) ∈JOs
3
may be diagonalised using a F4(4)
transformation [194] and the representative elements of each of the orbits [30] may be chosen as in Table 18
(where k = I3 ̸= 0). These will appear as the charge orbits of Table 33 in the conventional black hole/qutrit

correspondence. When making the alternative two-qutrit comparison of section 13.3, the rank corresponds
to the Schmidt number of the reduced density matrix [102].
In the quantum theory the black hole charges become integer valued and, consequently, the relevant
space is the set of 3 × 3 Hermitian matrices deﬁned over the integral split octonions JOs
Z
3 . The U-duality
is broken to E6(6)(Z), the norm preserving group in the integral case. It was suggested in [195] that any
charge vector, with non-vanishing cubic norm, in the integral theory could be brought in to the standard
form originally used in [43]. This amounts to the diagonalisability of 3 × 3 Hermitian matrices deﬁned
over the integral split octonions. It was shown in [196] that an arbitrary J3(P) in JOs
Z
3
is equivalent, under
E6(6)(Z), to an element of the form,
J3(P) = diag(p1, p2, p3),
pi ≥0 ∈Z,
(9.29)
where pi|p(i+1) and all zeros on the diagonal appear in the lower right corner. Interestingly, unlike the
continuous case, valid in the low energy eﬀective ﬁeld theory approximation, E6(6)(Z) acts transitively on
elements of cubic norm n if and only if n is squarefree [182]. Otherwise said, there exist distinct black hole
conﬁgurations with the same entropy that are not related by the discrete U-duality group.
9.5. The Freudenthal triple system
Dimensionally reducing from ﬁve to four dimensions the black hole charge conﬁgurations of N = 8
supergravity may be represented using the FTS, originally introduced in [180], deﬁned over the corresponding
D = 5 Jordan algebra. Following the conventions of [192, 182], a FTS may always be constructed from a
cubic Jordan algebra J as follows. Given a cubic Jordan algebra J over R deﬁne the vector space M(J),
M(J) = R ⊕R ⊕J ⊕J.
(9.30)
An arbitrary element x ∈M(J) may be written as a “2 × 2 matrix”,
x =
α
X
Y
β

where α, β ∈R
and
X, Y ∈J.
(9.31)
The bilinear antisymmetric quadratic form {x, y} is deﬁned as,
{x, y} = αδ −βγ + Tr(X, Z) −Tr(Y, W),
(9.32)
73

where,
x =

α
X
Y
β

,
y =

γ
W
Z
δ

,
(9.33)
and the trace bilinear form (9.7d) is deﬁned as on J. The quartic norm is given by,
q(x) = −2[αβ −Tr(X, Y )]2 −8[αN(X) + βN(Y ) −Tr(X#, Y #)],
(9.34)
where all the necessary deﬁnitions are inherited from the underlying Jordan algebra J. A symmetric four-
linear form, q(x, y, w, z), is obtained by linearising (9.34) so that q(x, x, x, x) = q(x). The non-degeneracy
of both q(x, y, w, z) and {x, y} allows one to uniquely deﬁne a trilinear map, the triple product, T : M(J) ×
M(J) × M(J) →M(J), by [192],
{T(x, y, w), z} = q(x, y, w, z).
(9.35)
The automorphism group Aut(M(J)) is given by the set of all transformations which leave both {x, y}
and q(x, y, w, z) invariant. When J is either R⊕Qn or JA
3 the set of transformations Aut(M(J)) forms a Lie
group, and M(J) a corresponding irreducible representation as described in Table 19. When A = R, C, H, O

(9.36c)
where s ∈Str(J) and s∗is its adjoint deﬁned with respect to the trace bilinear form, Tr(X, s(Y )) =
Tr(s∗(X), Y ).
The rank of an element x ∈M(J) may be uniquely deﬁned using the relations [182],
Rank x = 4
iﬀ
q(x) ̸= 0,
Rank x ≤3
iﬀ
q(x) = 0,
Rank x ≤2
iﬀ
T(x, x, x) = 0,
Rank x ≤1

3T(x, x, y) + {x, y}x = 0,
∀y ∈M(J),
Rank x = 0
iﬀ
x = 0.
(9.37)
The rank, deﬁned in this manner, is invariant under Aut(M(J)). Further, when J = JA
3 for A = Cs, Hs, Os,
Aut(M(J)) acts transitively on the sets of elements of rank 1, 2 or 3 and on elements of a given norm q in
the rank 4 case. These orbits union x = 0 partition the whole space M(JA
3 ) [182].

9.6. D = 4 black holes and Freudenthal triples
In D = 4 the black hole charges may be described by the Freudenthal triple system [30] realised as 2 × 2
“matrices”
F(p, q) =
 −q0
J3(P)
J3(Q)
p0

,
(9.38)
where p0 and q0 are real numbers that correspond to the graviphoton charges appearing after dimensional
reduction from D = 5.
The magic N = 2, D = 4, given by J = JA
3 , A = R, C, H, O, supergravities
have symmetries Sp(6, R), SU(3, 3), SO∗(12), and E7(−25) respectively, while the N = 8 case, given by
A = Os, has E7(7).
The charge representations have dimensions (6 dim A + 8) and correspond to the
threefold antisymmetric traceless tensor (14′) of Sp(6, R), the threefold antisymmetric self-dual tensor (20)
of SU(3, 3), the chiral spinor (32) of SO∗(12) and the fundamental (56) of E7(−25) or E7(7) as indicated in
Table 19. The real case corresponds to the decomposition
Sp(6, R) ⊃SL(3, R),
(9.39)
under which
14 →1 + 1 + 6 + 6′,
(9.40)
where p0 q0 are the singlets and J3(P), J3(Q) are the 6, 6′. The complex case corresponds to the decompo-
sition
SU(3, 3) ⊃SL(3, C),
(9.41)
under which
20′ →1 + 1 + 9 + 9′.
(9.42)
The quaternionic case corresponds to the decomposition
SO∗(12) ⊃SU ∗(6),
(9.43)
under which
32 →1 + 1 + 15 + 15′.
(9.44)
The octonionic case corresponds to the decomposition
E7(−25) ⊃E6(−26),
(9.45)
under which
56 →1 + 1 + 27 + 27′.
(9.46)
The N = 8 case then also follows [30] by using E7(7) and the split octonions in (9.15) and (9.38). We have
E7(7) ⊃E6(6),
(9.47)
under which
56 →1 + 1 + 27 + 27′.
(9.48)
Finally, the N = 2 STU model is given by J = R⊕R⊕R, in which case the black hole charge representation
has dimension 8 and transforms as the (2, 2, 2) of [SL(2, R)]3.
In all cases the black hole entropy is
S = π
p
|I4|,
(9.49)
where I4 is Cartan’s quartic invariant given by half the quartic norm (9.34),
I4(p0, P; q0, Q) = −

where P · Q = 1
2(PQ + QP) and P 2 = PP.
9.6.1. N = 2 STU subsectors
The STU model may, in addition to the realisation using J = R ⊕R ⊕R, be obtained as a consistent
truncation of the full N = 8 theory. This corresponds to the simple case where we put Ps,v,c, Qs,v,c all to
zero, then
F(P, Q) =

J3(pi)
J3(qi)
p0

,
(9.52)
where
J3(pi) = diag(p1, p2, p3),
J3(qi) = diag(q1, q2, q3).
(9.53)
In this case,
I3(P) = p1p2p3,
I3(Q) = q1q2q3,
(9.54)
and
J3
#(P) = diag(p2p3, p1p3, p1p2),
J3
#(Q) = diag(q2q3, q1q3, q1q2),
(9.55)
and I4 becomes
I4 = −(p · q)2 + 4


−4p0q1q2q3 + 4q0p1p2p3.
(9.56)
If we make the identiﬁcations (6.20), we recover Cayley’s hyperdeterminant (4.33a). Combined with (4.38)
we obtain the transformation between P, Q and p, q:

(9.57)
8So the square of the black hole entropy is quantised, at least to this order.
76

This transformation gives us the relations:
P 2
= 2(p2p3 −p0q1),
P · Q =
p · q
−2p1q1,
Q2
= 2(p1q0 + q2q3),
(9.58)
hence we ﬁnd
I4 = P 2Q2 −(P · Q)2,
(9.59)
which is manifestly invariant under SL(2) × SO(2, 2). In the Fano basis this is equivalent to just keeping
one point of the dual Fano plane i.e. aABD.
9.6.2. The N = 4 subsectors
The next simplest case is where we keep just the s octonions. This corresponds to a consistent truncation
to the N = 4 theory. In this case,
I3(P) = p1p2p3 −p1PsP s,
I3(Q) = q1q2q3 −q1QsQs,
(9.60)
and
J3
#(P) =


p2p3 −PsP s

(9.61)
Therefore I4 becomes
I4 = −(p0q0 + piqi + 2(Ps · Qs))2 + 4
h
q0(p1p2p3 −p1Ps
2) −p0(q1q2q3 −q1Qs

,
(9.62)
where
Ps
2 = PsP s,
Ps · Qs = 1
2(PsQs + QsPs),
Qs
2 = QsQs.
(9.63)
Hence we ﬁnd
I4 = P 2Q2 −(P · Q)2 −2(P 2Qs
2 + Q2Ps
2) + 4(Ps
2Qs
2 −P · QP 2 · Qs −(Ps · Qs)2).
(9.64)
So if we identify
Ps =

(9.66)
then
I4 = P 2Q2 −(P · Q)2,
(9.67)
where the indices now run over 0, . . . , 11, which is manifestly invariant under SL(2) × SO(2, 10) or SL(2) ×
SO(6, 6) according to whether we use the octonions or split octonions. In the Fano basis this is equivalent
to just keeping one line aABD of the Fano plane. In constructing the dictionary between these bases we
shall see that this particular case is given by the line (aABD, cCDF , dDEG) deﬁned by the common qubit D.
All-in-all there are three N = 4 subsectors, transforming as the (2, 12) of SL(2) × SO(6, 6) related to
aABD, one for each line deﬁned by the qubits A, B and D:

Note, the third line of each these equations is related to one of the three equations (A.15) derived using the
transvectants of Appendix A.

only (Ps, Qs) and (Pc, Qc) in the FTS, we ﬁnd,

This corresponds to the complementary (1, 32) of SL(2)×SO(6, 6). The qubit subsector is given by keeping
the 32 numbers (bBCE, cCDF , dDEG, fF BG). Note the absence of Alice. This is the quadrangle of the dual
Fano plane complementary to the line deﬁned by A.
9.6.3. U-duality charge orbits and the FTS
The U-duality orbits of N = 8, D = 4 supergravity were calculated in [30] and are presented in Table 16.
It is not diﬃcult to show [182] that using the E7(7) transformations given in (9.36a) any non-zero charge
conﬁguration
F(p, q) =
 −q0
J3(P)
J3(Q)


,
(9.70)
may be put in the form,
˜F(p, q) =

1
˜J3(P)
0
˜p0

.
(9.71)
We then have that for each rank 1 to 4, as deﬁned in (9.37), the conﬁguration (9.71) is equivalent under E7(7)
to one of the standard conﬁgurations of Table 20 [182]. It was proved in [182] that E7(7) acts transitively
on the elements of rank 1, 2, 3 and on elements of norm q in the rank 4 case. Further, these orbits are
distinct and their union with the zero element gives the full charge space. Note, each rank corresponds to
a three-qubit entanglement class [17], described in Table 1. The rank 1, 2 and 3 cases are equivalent to the
separable |111⟩, bi-partite entangled |111⟩+ |001⟩and W |111⟩+ |001⟩+ |010⟩states respectively. The rank
4 case is equivalent to a GHZ |111⟩+ |001⟩+ |010⟩+ p3|100⟩state with unnormalised 3-tangle (4.54) given
by 16|p3|.

9.6.4. [SL(2)]3 ⊂E7 transformations
The φ and ψ transformations of the Freudenthal construction may be restricted to [SL(2)]3 ⊂E7
transformations by requiring the J transformation parameter to be diagonal. This follows directly from
their deﬁnitions (9.36a) and from the fact that a general three-qubit state is of the form (9.72). The X +βZ
and Y + αZ elements of (9.36a) clearly demonstrate that only diagonal transformation parameters can
preserve the form of the J slots.

(9.72)
In this restricted form φ and ψ may be used to convert a general eight-parameter state (9.72) to various
canonical forms. A simple example is the ﬁve-parameter state retaining only the 0, 1, 2, 4, and 7 components
of the state vector (9.73), as considered in [103],


(9.73)
This may be obtained via a single ψ transformation,
ψ(Z) = ψ(diag(q1, q2, q3)/q0).
(9.74)
A more complicated example is a ﬁve-parameter state retaining the 0, 4, 5, 6, 7 components [115]. A single
ψ or φ transformation will not suﬃce and instead the transformation is of the form
ψ(diag(0, 0, 1)) ◦φ(−diag(d1, d2, d3)).
(9.75)

(9.76)
Furthermore, it is instructive to consider the case of a real hyperdeterminant whose value is successively
greater than, less than, and equal to zero. See Table 21. In this manner, the conversion of general to
canonical states is related explicitly to the STU model scalars.

10. CARTAN-FANO-FREUDENTHAL DICTIONARIES
10.1. Three descriptions
The N = 8 black hole charges belong to the fundamental 56-dimensional representation of E7(7) and the
black hole entropy is given by
S = π
p
|I4|,
(10.1)
where I4 is Cartan’s quartic invariant, the singlet in 56 × 56 × 56 × 56. We have seen that this invariant
also plays the role of an entanglement measure on the QI side. So we need to study its properties in some
detail.
As we have discussed, there are three descriptions of the group E7 and its quartic invariant that we will
ﬁnd useful:
1. Cartan basis:
E7 ⊃SO(8),
56 →28 + 28,
I4(x, y) = −tr(xy)2 + 1
4(tr xy)2 −4(Pf x + Pf y).
(10.2)
where xIJ and yIJ are antisymmetric 8 × 8 matrices and Pf is the Pfaﬃan.
2. Freudenthal/Jordan basis

Black holes are more conveniently described in either the Cartan or Freudenthal bases, whereas the Fano
basis is tailored to the qubits. Hence it is important to ﬁnd the three dictionaries that relate these three
descriptions. First we discuss each description in more detail.
10.2. Cartan-Fano dictionary
10.2.1. Cyclic basis
The dual Fano plane structure constants of Table 13 deﬁne antisymmetric matrices xIJ and yIJ according
to the dictionary of Table 22.
The 56 state vector coeﬃcients, aABD through gGAC, are arranged in xIJ and yIJ according to the
octonionic multiplication table of the dual Fano plane, compare Table 12 with the matrices (10.5a) and
(10.5b) below. This uniquely determines the rows of Table 22.
The positions of the binary indices in xIJ and yIJ are speciﬁed by the columns of Table 22. The ﬁrst
column describes the position of 111 in xIJ (and 000 in yIJ). Note, the ﬁrst column consists of all pairs i0,
i.e. the ﬁrst row and column of xIJ and yIJ. To understand the structure of the remaining three columns
let us consider a speciﬁc example given by considering Alice’s qubit A. For each row in Table 22 one can
form a triple ijk from the pair i0, appearing in the ﬁrst column, and any one of the remaining pairs jk
in that row. We note that 715 is the unique triple common to rows aABD, eEF A and gGCA, the subsector
81

deﬁned by the common qubit A. Then, in each case the non-trivial pair jk sits in the column labelled by the
position of the common qubit. In our example this is A. Therefore the pair 57 belonging to row aABD sits
in the 100 column where the position of A in ABD corresponds to the position of 1 in 100 or, equivalently,
the position of 0 in 011. Similarly, 71 sits in the column labelled 001 because A is last in eEF A. Finally, 15
sits in the column labelled 010 because A is second in gGAC. Repeating this procedure for the remaining
six qubits, B through G, uniquely determines all the columns of Table 22. This procedure may be followed
to construct the dictionary based on any octonionic basis.

by antisymmetry.

xIJ = ηILcLJKaK
φ(I,J),
yIJ = ηILcLJKaK
˜φ(I,J),

It may be useful to regard the eight components of each ai as a pair of quaternions.
An alternative way of arriving at Table 22 is to note that each entry (ij) represents the row i and column
j in which the letters a, b, c, d, e, f, g (or numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7) appear with a positive sign in the matrix
of Table 24.

is more convenient to use the binary basis. The addition table for the numbers 0 to 7 written in binaries is

Kallosh and Linde have shown that in a canonical basis I4 depends on 4 complex eigenvalues represented
as Cayley’s hyperdeterminant of a hypermatrix aABD.
Looking at (8.2) we note that only the SO(8)
symmetry is manifest, yet it was proved in [162] and [62] that the sum of all terms in (8.2) is invariant under
an SU(8) symmetry, which acts as follows
δ(xIJ ± iyIJ) = (2Λ[I
[KδJ]
L] ± iΣIJKL)(xKL ∓iyKL).
(10.18)
The total number of parameters is 63; 28 are from the manifest SO(8) and 35 from the antisymmetric
self-dual ΣIJKL = ∗ΣIJKL. Thus one can use the SU(8) transformation of the complex matrix xIJ + iyIJ

The relation between the complex coeﬃcients λα, the parameters xIJ and yIJ, the matrix aABD and the
black hole charges pi and qk [3] is given by the following dictionary:
λ1 = x01 + iy01 = a111 + ia000 = q0 + ip0,
λ2 = x23 + iy23 = a100 + ia011 = −p3 + q3,
λ3 = x45 + iy45 = −a010 −ia101 = p2 −iq2,
λ4 = x56 + iy56 = −a001 −ia110 = p1 −iq1.

If we now write the quartic E7(7) Cartan invariant in the canonical basis
I4 =
−(x01y01 + x23y23 + x45y45 + x67y67)2
+ 4(x01x23y01y23 + x01x45y01y45 + x23x45y23y45

−4(x01x23x45x67 + y01y23y45y67),
(10.21)
then it may be compared to Cayley’s hyperdeterminant (4.33a). We ﬁnd
I4 = −Det a.
(10.22)
The above discussion of E7(7) also applies, mutatis mutandis, to E7(C).
Evidently, this particular representation of the 56 emphasises certain aspects, such as the Fano plane
structure, which are not clear in the other representations considered (see Appendix D for the an example
of how the symmetries of the Fano plane are manifested in the black hole entropy using the Fano basis).

10.3. Freudenthal-Fano dictionary
Let us now construct the analogous dictionary relating the 56 charges in the Freudenthal basis with
the 56 state vector coeﬃcients specifying the tripartite entanglement of seven qubits. See also [13]. It is
instructive to consider the chain of group decompositions E7(7) →E6(6) →SO(4, 4). Combining (9.46) and
(9.20) we have that the 56 decomposes as
56 →1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 8s + 8c + 8v + 8s + 8c + 8v,
(10.23)
under E7(7) ⊃SO(4, 4).
Combining this with the STU embedding in the FTS (9.52), the decompositions (9.46) and (9.20), and
the dictionary as given in (4.33a) it is clear that the 8 state vector coeﬃcients, aABD, are associated with the
8 singlets appearing in (10.23). Now, consider the subgroup containing the three copies of SL(2) associated
with the tripartite entanglement of qubits A, B and D,
E7(7) ⊃SL(2)A × SL(2)B × SL(2)D × SO(4, 4),
(10.24)
under which,
56 →(2, 2, 2, 1) + (2, 1, 1, 8v) + (1, 2, 1, 8s) + (1, 1, 2, 8c).
(10.25)
We note that qubit A transforms as doublet with the 8v. This suggests that we associate the subsector
deﬁned by the common qubit A, namely aABD|ABD⟩+ eEF A|EFA⟩+ gGAC|GAC⟩, with the 8v. This is
one of the consistent N = 4 truncations of the full N = 8 theory, the 24 black hole charges transforming as
a (2, 12) of SL(2)A × SO(6, 6) [6]. Repeating this analysis for qubit B leads us to identify the bBCE and
fF GB with the 8s, while considering D we identify cCDF and dDEG with the 8c.
To specify more precisely the dictionary between (eEF A, gGAC) and (Pv, Qv), (bBCE, fF GB) and (Ps, Qs),
and ﬁnally, (cCDF , dDEG) and (Pc, Qc), we begin by noting that the 8 charges of the STU model may be
arranged in a cube as depicted in Figure 4. Following [197], the cube may be partitioned into a pair of 2 × 2
matrices, (Mi, Ni) in three independent ways. These are given by the three possible slicings of the cube
along its planes of symmetry,

(10.26c)
For any element,

∈SL(2)i,
1 ≤i ≤3,
(10.27)
the action on the cube is given by
(Mi, Ni) 7→(rMi + sNi, tMi + uNi).
(10.28)
The individual actions of the three SL(2)i all commute and, therefore, this provides a natural representation
of [SL(2)]3 [197]. Deﬁne the three binary quadratic forms, one for each slicing,
fi(x, y) = det(Mix + Niy),
1 ≤i ≤3.
(10.29)
Explicitly
f1 = −(q2q1 + p3q0)x2 + (p · q −2p3q3)xy −(p2p1 −p0q3)y2,
f2 = −(q1q3 + p2q0)x2 + (p · q −2p2q2)xy −(p1p3 −p0q2)y2,
f3 = −(q3q2 + p1q0)x2 + (p · q −2p1q1)xy −(p3p2 −p0q1)y2.
(10.30)
87

These quadratic forms may also be systematically derived using transvectants as presented in Appendix A.
Each one is invariant under two of the three factors in [SL(2)]3. For example, f1 is invariant under the
subgroup {id1} × SL2(2) × SL3(2) ⊂[SL(2)]3. Taking the determinant of the Hessian, H(fi), which is
actually given by γi(a), as deﬁned in (4.35), yields Cayley’s hyperdeterminant
det H(fi) = det

= det γi(a) = −Det aABC,
1 ≤i ≤3.
(10.31)
Now, consider keeping (pi, qi) and only one of (Ps, Qs), (Pv, Qv) or (Pc, Qc) and computing I4 from the
FTS. Recall, this gives us the entropy of one of the three N = 4 subsectors as deﬁned by one of the three
qubits, A, B or D. Keeping only (pi, qi, Pv, Qv), the N = 4 subsector deﬁned by the common qubit A, one
ﬁnds
I4 = 4(p2p1 −p0q3)(q2q1 + p3q0) −4(p.q −2p3q3)2 + 4Pv
2Qv
2 −(P v · Qv)2
(10.32)
−4(p2p1 −p0q3)Qv
2 −4(q2q1 + p3q0)Pv
2 −4(p · q −2p3q3)Pv · Qv,
(10.33)
where Pv2 = Pv ¯Pv and 2Pv · Qv = (Pv ¯Qv + Qv ¯Pv). The terms involving (pi, qi) correspond to γ1(a), which
is correctly associated with qubit A, via the dictionary (4.33a),
2(p1p2 −p0q3) = −γ1(a)00,
2(q1q2 + p3q0) = −γ1(a)11,
p · q −2p3q3 = γ1(a)01.
(10.34)
This agrees with the conclusions drawn from the decomposition given in (10.25). Keeping either (P s, Qs)
or (P c, Qc) instead would have resulted in a diﬀerent associated slicing of the cube Figure 4 and, hence,
matrix γi(a). We then identify (gGAC, eEF A) with (Pv, Qv) such that
Pv
2 = γ2(g)00 + γ3(e)00,
Qv
2 = γ2(g)11 + γ3(e)11,
Pv · Qv = γ2(g)01 + γ3(e)01,
(10.35)
where, for example, the index on γ2(g) is determined by the position of the common qubit A in the corre-
sponding tripartite subsystem, GAC. Computing I4 one ﬁnds
I4 = det(γ1(a) + γ3(e) + γ2(g)) ∼−Det a −Det e −Det g + 2(a2g2 + a2e2 + e2g2),
(10.36)
where products like
a2e2 = 1
2εA1A4εB1B2εD1D2εE3E4εF3F4εA2A3
× aA1B1D1aA2B2D2eE3F3A3eE4F4A4,
(10.37)
describe the entanglement between two tripartite subsystems connected by a common qubit, in this case
A. This may be repeated for the remaining two cases, keeping (Ps, Qs) or (Pc, Qc), associated with the
common qubits B and D respectively, to construct the whole dictionary9. For each of the seven possible
N = 4 subsectors one obtains the appropriate result, analogous to (10.36), as presented in (10.40).
We are now able to select any particular subsector of the full N = 8 theory by choosing the appropriate
components of the FTS and systematically determine the corresponding qubit system and its measure of
entanglement.
In summary the dictionary is

The N = 4 subsector invariant under SL(2)X × SO(6, 6) is given by
Idac = det(γ1(d) + γ3(a) + γ2(c)),
X = D
Iebd = det(γ1(e) + γ3(b) + γ2(d)),
X = E
Ifce = det(γ1(f) + γ3(c) + γ2(e)),
X = F
Igdf = det(γ1(g) + γ3(d) + γ2(f)),
X = G
Iaeg = det(γ1(a) + γ3(e) + γ2(g)),
X = A
Ibfa = det(γ1(b) + γ3(f) + γ2(a)),
X = B
Icgb = det(γ1(c) + γ3(g) + γ2(b)),
X = C.
(10.40)
In terms of ai
ABD, we may write these in two diﬀerent ways, for example
Idac = det(γ1(a4) + γ3(a1) + γ2(a3)),
X = D,
(10.41)
where
a4
DEG = dDEG,
a1
ABD = aABD,
a3
CDF = cCDF ,
(10.42)
or
Idac = det(γ1(a4) + γ1(a1) + γ1(a3)),
X = D,
(10.43)
where
a4
DEG = dDEG,
a1
DAB = aABD,
a3
DF C = cCDF ,
(10.44)
in which case the result is connected to Cayley over the imaginary quaternions
Idac = Det a = −1

× ai
A1B1C1aj
A2B2C2ak
A3B3C3al
A4B4C4δijδkl.
(10.45)
However, the dictionary (10.42) can be applied universally to all the Iijk in (10.40) whereas the dictionary
(10.44) requires changing for each one. For example, one can write
Iebd = det(γ1(a5) + γ1(a2) + γ1(a4)),
X = E,
(10.46)
89

but now we require a diﬀerent a4:
a5
EF A = eEF A,
a2
EBC = bBCE,
a4
EGD = dDEG.
(10.47)
So this dictionary does not lend itself to describing the N = 8 invariant.

11. CAYLEY, CARTAN AND THE OCTONIONS
11.1. N = 4 Cartan invariant and the quaternions
Deﬁne
Pµν = PµQν −QµPν,
(11.1)
where µ = 0, 1, 2, 3; then Cayley can be written
−Det a = 1
2PµνP µν = P 2Q2 −(P · Q)2,
(11.2)
where we use the SO(2, 2) metric. This is the N = 2 expression invariant under SL(2) × SO(2, 2). Now
deﬁne
P
ij
µν
= P i
µQj
ν −Qi

(11.3)
where i = 1, 2, 3, then
−Det a = 1
2P
ij
µν
P µνij = P 2Q2 −(P · Q)2,
(11.4)
where we now use the SO(6, 6) metric. This is the N = 4 expression, invariant under SL(2) × SO(6, 6).
So if we write
−Det a = 1
2P
ij
µν
P µνklXijkl,
(11.5)
we need
Xijkl = δikδjl + · · · ,
(11.6)
where the dots refer to terms that vanish when contracted with P
ij
µν
P µνkl. Note that Xijkl is symmetric
under
i →j ; k →l,
i →k ; j →l,
i →l ; j →k.
(11.7)
11.2. Cayley over the imaginary quaternions
If we denote the imaginary quaternions by ei where i = 1, 2, 3, the structure constants are deﬁned by
eiej = −δij + εijkek.
(11.8)
and so we obtain the quartic expression
eiejekel = (−δij + εijmem)(−δkl + εklnen)
= δijδkl −εijmεklm −δijεklnen −δklεijmem + εijmεklnεmnpep,
(11.9)
or
eiejekel = δijδkl −δikδjl + δilδjk −δijεklnen −δklεijmem + εijmεklnεmnpep.
(11.10)
The combination
eiejelek + eiekejel = δijδkl + εijmεklm + δijεklnen −δklεijmem
−εijmεklnεmnpep + δikδjl −εikmεjlm
−δikεjlnen −δjlεikmem −εikmεjlnεmnpep.
(11.11)
yields
eiejelek + eiekejel =
δijδkl −δilδjk + δikδjl
+ δijεklnen −δklεijmem −εijmεklnεmnpep
+ δikδjl −δijδkl + δilδjk
−δikεjlnen −δjlεikmem + εikmεjlnεmnpep
= 2δikδjl + · · · ,
(11.12)
95

where the dots refer to terms that vanish when contracted with P
ij
µν
P µνkl. So Cayley over the imaginary
quaternions in the form
−Det a = 1
4P
ij
µν
P µνkl(eiejelek + eiekejel)
(11.13)
yields the N = 4, SL(2) × SO(6, 6) invariant.
In terms of the a’s, on the other hand, the N = 4 invariant is given by (10.45). So we require the diﬀerent
ordering
eiejekel + eiekelej = 2δijδkl + · · · ,
(11.14)
where the dots refer to terms that vanish when contracted with
Aijkl = −1
2εA1A2εB1B2εA3A4εB3B4εD1D4εD2D3
(11.15)
× ai
A1B1D1aj
A2B2D2ak
A3B3D3al
A4B4D4.
(11.16)
Let us consider the case where we choose the imaginary quaternions to be
q = ae1 + ee5 + ge7 .
(11.17)
In order to deﬁne Cayley over imaginary quaternions one needs to be careful with the ordering of the indices
in aABD, eEF A and gGAC when contracting them with εA1A2, etc in (11.15). The ﬁnal result is given by

(11.18)
which is twice the N = 4 subsector of I4 where we keep the letters a, e and g with the common qubit A.
The factor 2 comes from equation (11.14).
11.3. N = 8 Cartan invariant and the octonions
Here we adopt the imaginary octonions, ei where i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, with the dual Fano structure
constants cijk
eiej = −δij + cijkek.
(11.19)
We have the same identities as for the Fano structure constants in section 8.3
cpmkcqkn + cqmkcpkn = δpmδqn + δpnδqm −2δpqδmn.
(11.20)
[ei, [ej, ek]] + [ek, [ei, ej]] + [ej, [ek, ei]]
= 4(cjkmcimn + cijmckmn + ckimcjmn)en
=: 3cijklel,
(11.21)
96

where cijkl satisﬁes
cijkl = 1
6εijklmnpcmnp,
(11.22)
and
cijkl = −cmijcmkl −δilδjk + δikδjl.
(11.23)
We also note
cijmcklm = δikδjl −δilδjk −cijkl,
(11.24)
and
cijncklmn = −ciklδmj + cjklδmi
−cilmδkj + cjlmδki
−cimkδlj + cjmkδli.
(11.25)
With regard to non-associativity, there are two cubic possibilities:
(eiej)ek = (−δij + cijmem)ek
= −δijek + cijm(−δmk + cmknen)
= −δijek −cijk + cijmcmknen
= −cijk −δijek + δkiej −δjkei −cijklel,
(11.26a)
ei(ejek) = ei(−δjk + cjkmem)
= −δjkei + cjkm(−δim + cimnen)
= −δjkei −cjki + cjkmcimnen
= −cijk −δijek + δkiej −δjkei + cijklel.
(11.26b)
Note that they diﬀer only by the sign of the associator term. Similarly, there are ﬁve quartic possibilities:
(eiej)(ekel) = (−δij + cijmem)(−δkl + cklnen)
= δijδkl −cijmcklm −δijcklnen −δklcijmem + cijmcklncmnpep
= δijδkl −δikδjl + δilδjk + cijkl

Note again that the real parts of (11.27a),(11.27b),(11.27c) diﬀer from the real parts of (11.27d),(11.27e)
by the sign of the associator term. The real parts of all the multiplication orderings (11.27a)-(11.27e) are
invariant under (11.7). The imaginary part of (11.27a) is cancelled by itself under this symmetry. The
imaginary parts of (11.27b) and (11.27c) cancel each other under this symmetry. The imaginary parts of
(11.27d) and (11.27e) also cancel each other under this symmetry. Note also that for these real parts, there
are six distinct combinations since
eiejekel ∼
δijδkl −δikδjl + δilδjk + cijkl,
eiejelek ∼
δijδkl + δikδjl −δilδjk −cijkl,
eiekejel ∼−δijδkl + δikδjl + δilδjk −cijkl,
eiekelej ∼

eielejek ∼−δijδkl + δikδjl + δilδjk + cijkl,
eielekej ∼
δijδkl −δikδjl + δilδjk −cijkl,
(11.28)
and that the remaining 18 permutations are obtained from these by (11.7). Note that the combination
eiejekel + eiekelej ∼
δijδkl −δikδjl + δilδjk + cijkl
+ δikδlj −δilδkj + δijδkl + ciklj
= 2(δijδkl + cijkl).
(11.29)
Since the N = 8 Cartan invariant is just the singlet in 56 × 56 × 56 × 56, it follows from (8.44) that it may
be expressed as a linear combination of the ﬁve quartic products given above. In analogy with (11.14), one
might be tempted to construct the N = 8 invariant by contracting (11.29) with (11.15). However, although
the new associator terms generate new 4-way cross terms of the kind
abce + bcdf + cdeg + defa + efgb + fgac + gabd
(11.30)
they cannot be the correct 4-way cross terms of (8.30), because the way that the epsilons are contracted is
diﬀerent from the Cayley form (8.28) used in (11.15). So although the N = 4 Cartan invariant may be given
by Cayley over the quaternions, and although the N = 8 Cartan invariant is given by a quartic product
over the octonions, it is not simply given by Cayley over the octonions.

12. FIVE-DIMENSIONAL BLACK HOLES
12.1. Five-dimensional supergravity
In ﬁve dimensions we might consider:
1. N = 2 supergravity coupled to l vector multiplets where the symmetry is SO(1, 1, Z) × SO(l −1, 1, Z)
and the black holes carry charges belonging to the (l + 1) representation (all electric) .
2. N = 4 supergravity coupled to m −1 vector multiplets where the symmetry is SO(1, 1, Z) × SO(m −
1, 5, Z) where the black holes carry charges belonging to the (m + 4) representation (all electric).
3. N = 8 supergravity where the symmetry is the non-compact exceptional group E6(6)(Z) and the black
holes carry charges belonging to the fundamental 27-dimensional representation (all electric).
The electrically charged objects are point-like and the magnetic duals are one-dimensional, or string-
like, transforming according to the contragredient representation. In all three cases above there exist cubic
invariants akin to the determinant which yield the corresponding black hole or black string entropy.
In this section we brieﬂy describe the salient properties of maximal N = 8 case, following [157]. We have
27 abelian gauge ﬁelds which transform in the fundamental representation of E6(6). The ﬁrst invariant of
E6(6) is the cubic invariant (9.18) which may also be written as [162, 198, 157, 30, 199]
I3(Q) = qijΩjlqlmΩmnqnpΩpi,
(12.1)
where qij is the charge vector transforming as a 27 which can be represented as traceless Sp(8) matrix. The
entropy of a black hole with charges qij is then given by
S = π
p
|I3(Q)|.
(12.2)
In ﬁve dimensions the compact group H is USp(8). We choose our conventions so that USp(2) = SU(2).
In the commutator of the supersymmetry generators we have a central charge matrix ZAB which can be
brought to a normal form by a USp(8) transformation. In the normal form the central charge matrix can
be written as
ZAB =


.
(12.3)
We can order the si so that |s1| ≥|s2| ≥|s3|. The cubic invariant, in this basis, becomes
I3 = s1s2s3.
(12.4)
Even though the eigenvalues si might depend on the moduli, the invariant (12.4) only depends on the
quantised values of the charges. We can write a generic charge conﬁguration as UeU t, where e is the normal
frame as above, and the invariant will then be (12.4). There are three distinct possibilities as shown in
Table 33.

Table 33: Classiﬁcation of D = 5, N = 8 black holes. The distinct charge orbits are determined by the number of non-vanishing
eigenvalues and I3, as well as the number of unbroken supersymmetries.
Note that, in contrast to the four-dimensional case where ﬂipping the sign of I4 interchanges BPS and
non-BPS black holes, the sign of the I3 (12.4) is not important since it changes under a CPT transformation.
There are no non-BPS orbits in ﬁve dimensions.
99

In ﬁve dimensions there are also string-like conﬁgurations which are the magnetic duals of the conﬁgura-
tions considered here. They transform in the contragredient 27′ representation and the solutions preserving
1/2, 1/4, 1/8 supersymmetries are characterised in an analogous way. The entropy of a black string with
charges pij is then given by
S = π
p
|I3(P)|.
(12.5)
It is useful to decompose the U-duality group into the T-duality group and the S-duality group. The
decomposition reads E6 →SO(5, 5) × SO(1, 1), leading to
27 →161 + 10−2 + 14.
(12.6)
The last term in (12.6) corresponds to the NS ﬁve-brane charge. The 16 correspond to the D-brane charges
and the 10 correspond to the 5 directions of KK momentum and the 5 directions of fundamental string
winding, which are the charges that explicitly appear in string perturbation theory. The cubic invariant has
the decomposition
(27)3 →10−2 10−2 14 + 161 161 10−2.
(12.7)
This is saying that in order to have a non-zero area black hole we must have three NS charges (more precisely
some “perturbative” charges and a solitonic ﬁve-brane); or one can have two D-brane charges and one NS
charge. In particular, it is not possible to have a black hole with a non-zero horizon area with purely D-brane
charges.
Another version of the cubic invariant is given as follows [163]: Take two 6-vectors xi and yj and a
skew-symmetric 6 × 6 matrix zij. This corresponds to the decomposition
E6(6) ⊃SL(2) × SL(6),
(12.8)
under which
27 →(2, 6) + (1, 15).
(12.9)
Now consider the expression
I3 = Pf(z) + zijxiyj,
(12.10)
where Pf is the Pfaﬃan. See also [200].
12.2. E6 and the bipartite entanglement of three qutrits
We have seen that in the case of two qutrits, the bipartite entanglement is classiﬁed using by [SL(3, C)]2
and that the entanglement measure is given by a determinant. To give a quantum-theoretic interpretation
of the N = 8 black hole, we begin by noting that
E6(6) ⊃[SL(3, R)]3,
(12.11)
and
E6(C) ⊃[SL(3, C)]3.
(12.12)
We shall now show that the corresponding system in quantum information theory is that of three qutrits
(Alice, Bob and Charlie) [201]. However, the larger symmetry requires that they undergo only a bipartite
entanglement of a very speciﬁc kind. The entanglement measure will be given by the cubic Cartan invariant
(9.18).
A crucial ingredient is that under
E6(6) ⊃SL(3)A × SL(3)B × SL(3)C,
(12.13)
the 27 decomposes as
27 →(3′, 3, 1) + (1, 3′, 3′) + (3, 1, 3).
(12.14)
An analogous decomposition holds for
E6(C) ⊃[SL(3, C)]3.
(12.15)
100

Notice that we ﬁnd three copies of the two qutrit Hilbert space
|Ψ⟩= aA′B|A′B⟩+ bB′C′|B′C′⟩+ cCA|CA⟩,
(12.16)
where A, A′ = 0, 1, 2. Note that:
1. Any pair of states has an individual in common
2. Each individual is excluded from one out of the three states
So we have three qutrits (Alice, Bob, Charlie) but where each person has bipartite entanglement with the
other two. However, as discussed in section 12.6, this 27-dimensional space is not a subspace of the three
qutrit Hilbert space (3, 3, 3).
The entanglement may be represented by a triangle with vertices ABC representing the qutrits and the
lines AB, BC and CA represent the entanglements. See Figure 14. The three states transforms as a pair of
A
B
C
Figure 14: The D = 5 analogue of Figure 11 is the three qutrit entanglement diagram corresponding to the decomposition
(12.14) and the state (12.16). It is a triangle with vertices A, B, C representing the qutrits and the lines AB, BC and CA
representing the entanglements.
triplets under two of the SL(3)’s and singlets under the remaining one. Individually, therefore, the bipartite
entanglement of each of the three states is given by the determinant. Taken together however, we see from
(8.15) that they transform as a complex 27 of E6(C). Their bipartite entanglement must be given by an
expression that is cubic in the coeﬃcients a, b, c and invariant under E6(C). The unique possibility is the
Cartan invariant I3, and so the 2-tangle is given by generalising (5.13) to
τ(ABC) = 27|I3|2.
(12.17)
If the wave-function (8.17) is normalised, then 0 ≤τ(ABC) ≤1.
Note the appearance of both primed and unprimed qutrit representations, a new feature not encountered
with qubits. This is because the ε symbol relates upper and lower indices for qubits
aA = εABaB,
(12.18)
while for qutrits aA and aA are diﬀerent:
aA = 1
2εAB1B2a[B1B2].
(12.19)
The antisymmetry of a[B1B2] allows the interpretation of the 3′ as a pair of indistinguishable “fermions”.
12.3. Decomposition of I3
To understand better the entanglement we note that, as a result of (12.14), Cartan’s invariant contains
not one determinant but three. It may be written as the sum of three terms each of which is invariant under
[SL(3)]2 plus cross terms. To see this, denote a 3 in one of the three entries in (12.14) by A. So we may
rewrite (12.14) as
27 = (AB) + (BC) + (CA),
(12.20)
or symbolically
27 = a + b + c.
(12.21)
101

Then I3 is the singlet in 27 × 27 × 27:
I3 = a3 + b3 + c3 + 6abc,
(12.22)
where the products
a3 = (AB)(AB)(AB)
= 1

(12.23a)

exclude one individual (Charlie, Alice, and Bob respectively), and the products

6aA

(12.24)
exclude none. These results may be veriﬁed using the following dictionary between a, b, c and the P v, P s, P c

p2 = −a1

p3 = −a2

(12.25d)
which yields,
I3 = det J3(P) = a3 + b3 + c3 + 6abc.
(12.26)
12.4. Subsectors
Just as in the E7 case one can truncate to just the (3, 3) in (12.14) which excludes Bob
|Ψ⟩= cCA|CA⟩.
(12.27)
This is described by just that line not passing through B in the ABC triangle,
(3, 3) = (CA) = c,
(12.28)
and the corresponding cubic invariant, I3, reduces to the singlet in (3, 3) × (3, 3) × (3, 3)
I3 = det cCA ∼c3.
(12.29)
12.5. Classiﬁcation of N = 8 black holes and three-qutrit states
In the N = 8 theory, “large” and “small” black holes are classiﬁed by the value of I3. Non-zero I3
corresponds to large black holes, which are BPS for both signs of I3, and vanishing I3 to small black holes.
We may have 1/8, 1/4 or 1/2 supersymmetry preserved.
102

The charge orbits [30, 157, 178] for the black holes depend on the number of unbroken supersymmetries
or the number of vanishing eigenvalues as in Table 33. For N = 8 the large black holes correspond to the
class of rank 3 Bell entangled states and small black holes to the rank 2 Bell or separable class. One way of
obtaining such states is to go the canonical basis (12.3) where the Cartan invariant reduces to (12.4). The
result is shown in Table 33. For example, a state with non-zero coeﬃcients
c00 = c11 = c22 =
1
√
3,
(12.30)
|Ψ⟩=
1
√
3(|000⟩+ |111⟩+ |222⟩)
(12.31)
is maximally entangled with
τ = 1.
(12.32)
Alternatively, having succeeded in writing the Cartan invariant in terms of a, b, c, in (12.26) we can now
look for entangled states in the full N = 8 theory. For example, the generalised Bell state with non-zero
coeﬃcients
a0
0 = a1
1 = a2
2 = b00 = b11 = b22 = c00 = c11 = c22 = 1
3
(12.33)
is entangled but not maximally since
τ = 16
27.
(12.34)
12.6.
Three 7-dit interpretation
We note that the 27-dimensional Hilbert space given in (12.14) is not a subspace of the 33-dimensional
three qutrit Hilbert space given by (3, 3, 3), but rather a direct sum of three 32-dimensional Hilbert spaces:
(3′, 3, 1) + (3, 1, 3) + (1, 3′, 3′).
(12.35)
This raises an ambiguity about the terminology bipartite entanglement of three qutrits. The state corre-
sponding to the usual 33-dimensional three qutrit Hilbert space given by (3, 3, 3) is
|Ψ⟩= aABC|ABC⟩
(12.36)
and one meaning of bipartite entanglement, AB say, would be that given by the reduced density matrix
ρAB = TrC|Ψ⟩⟨Ψ|.
(12.37)
So it is important to note that this is clearly diﬀerent from the meaning we have adopted in our discussion
of three qutrits elsewhere in this section.
The triplets in (12.35) have the interpretation as qutrits but what the singlets? A natural way to interpret
the singlets is to embed the qutrits into 7-dits and note that under
SL(7) ⊃SL(3)
(12.38)
we have
7 →3 + 3′ + 1.
(12.39)
The three 7-dit system (Alice, Bob, Charlie) is described by the state
|Ψ⟩= ˆa ˆ
A ˆ
B ˆ
C| ˆA ˆB ˆC⟩,
(12.40)
where ˆA = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and the Hilbert space has dimension 73 = 343. ˆa ˆ
A ˆ
B ˆ
C transforms as a (7, 7, 7)
under SL(7)A × SL(7)B × SL(7)C. Under
SL(7)A × SL(7)B × SL(7)C ⊃SL(3)A × SL(3)B × SL(3)C
(12.41)
103

we have
(7, 7, 7) →
(3′, 3′, 3′) + (3 , 3 , 3 ) + (1, 1 , 1 )
+ (3′, 3′, 3 ) + (3′, 3 , 3′) + (3, 3′, 3′)
+ (3′, 3 , 3 ) + (3 , 3′, 3 ) + (3, 3 , 3′)
+ (3′, 3′, 1 ) + (3′, 1 , 3′) + (1, 3′, 3′)
+ (3 , 3 , 1 ) + (3 , 1 , 3 ) + (1, 3 , 3 )
+ (3′, 1 , 1 ) + (1 , 3′, 1 ) + (1, 1 , 3′)
+ (3 , 1 , 1 ) + (1 , 3 , 1 ) + (1, 1 , 3 )
+ (3′, 1 , 3 ) + (3′, 3 , 1 ) + (1, 3 , 3′)
+ (3 , 1 , 3′) + (3 , 3′, 1 ) + (1, 3′, 3 ),
(12.42)
which contains (12.16) as a subspace.
|Ψ⟩= aA′B•|A′B•⟩+ b•BC|•BC⟩+ cA′•C′|A′ • C′⟩,
(12.43)
which we abbreviate by (12.16). So the triangle entanglement we have described ﬁts within conventional
quantum information theory, but we have discovered a hidden E6 symmetry of this special 27-dimensional
subspace.

13. MAGIC SUPERGRAVITIES
13.1. Magic supergravities in D = 4
The black holes described by Cayley’s hyperdeterminant are those of N = 2 supergravity coupled to
three vector multiplets, where the symmetry is [SL(2, Z)]3. In section 8 the following four-dimensional
generalisations were considered: (1) N = 2 supergravity coupled to l + 1 vector multiplets, (2) N = 4
supergravity coupled to m vector multiplets, (3) N = 8 supergravity. In all three case there exist quartic
invariants akin to Cayley’s hyperdeterminant whose square root yields the corresponding black hole entropy.
We succeeded in giving a quantum theoretic interpretation in the N = 8 case together with its truncations
to N = 4 (with m = 6) and N = 2 (with l = 2, the case we already knew [3]).
However, as suggested by Levay [7], one might also consider the “magic” supergravities [185, 183, 184,
202, 203]. These correspond to the R, C, H, O (real, complex, quaternionic and octonionic) N = 2, D = 4
supergravity coupled to 6, 9, 15 and 27 vector multiplets with symmetries Sp(6, Z), SU(3, 3), SO∗(12) and
E7(−25), respectively.
Once again, as has been shown just recently [204], in all cases there are quartic
invariants whose square root yields the corresponding black hole entropy.
Here we demonstrate that the black-hole/qubit correspondence does indeed continue to hold for magic
supergravities. The crucial observation is that, although the black hole charges aABC are real (integer)
numbers and the entropy (8.1) is invariant under E7(7)(Z), the coeﬃcients aABC that appear in the qubit
state (8.17) are complex. So the 3-tangle (8.18) is invariant under E7(C) which contains both E7(7)(Z)
and E7(−25)(Z) as subgroups. To ﬁnd a supergravity correspondence therefore, we could equally well have
chosen the magic octonionic N = 2 supergravity rather than the conventional N = 8 supergravity. The fact
that
E7(7)(Z) ⊃[SL(2, Z)]7,
(13.1)
but
E7(−25)(Z) ̸⊃[SL(2, Z)]7
(13.2)
is irrelevant. All that matters is that
E7(C) ⊃[SL(2, C)]7.
(13.3)
The same argument holds for the magic real, complex and quaternionic N = 2 supergravities which are, in
any case truncations of N = 8 (in contrast to the octonionic).
Having made this observation, one may then revisit the conventional N = 2 and N = 4 cases (1)
and (2) above.
When we looked at the seven qubit subsector E7(C) ⊃SL(2, C) × SO(12, C), we gave
an N = 4 supergravity interpretation with symmetry SL(2, R) × SO(6, 6) [6], but we could equally have
given an interpretation in terms of N = 2 supergravity coupled to 11 vector multiplets with symmetry
SL(2, R) × SO(10, 2).
Moreover, SO(l −1, 2) is contained in SO(l + 1, C) and SO(6, m) is contained in SO(12 + m, C) so we
can give a qubit interpretation to more vector multiplets for both N = 2 and N = 4, at least in the case of
SO(4n, C) which contains [SL(2, C)]2n.
13.2. Magic supergravities in D = 5
One might also consider the “magic” supergravities in D = 5 [185, 183, 184]. These correspond to the
R, C, H, O (real, complex, quaternionic and octonionic) N = 2 supergravity coupled to 5, 8, 14 and 26 vector
multiplets with symmetries SL(3, R), SL(3, C), SU ∗(6) and E6(−26) respectively. Once again, in all cases
there are cubic invariants whose square root yields the corresponding black hole entropy [204].
Here we demonstrate that the black-hole/qubit correspondence continue to hold for these D = 5 magic
supergravities, as well as D = 4 . Once again, the crucial observation is that, although the black hole charges
aAB are real (integer) numbers and the entropy (12.2) is invariant under E6(6)(Z), the coeﬃcients aAB that
appear in the wavefunction (12.16) are complex. So the 2-tangle (12.17) is invariant under E6(C) which
contains both E6(6)(Z) and E6(−26)(Z) as subgroups. To ﬁnd a supergravity correspondence therefore, we
105

could equally well have chosen the magic octonionic N = 2 supergravity rather than the conventional N = 8
supergravity. The fact that
E6(6)(Z) ⊃[SL(3, Z)]3,
(13.4)
but
E6(−26)(Z) ̸⊃[SL(3, Z)]3
(13.5)
is also irrelevant. All that matters is that
E6(C) ⊃[SL(3, C)]3.
(13.6)
Once again, the same argument holds for the magic real, complex and quaternionic N = 2 supergravities
which are, in any case truncations of N = 8 (in contrast to the octonionic).
Having made this observation, one may then revisit the conventional N = 2 and N = 4 cases (1) and
(2) of Equation 4.63. SO(l, 1) is contained in SO(l + 1, C) and SO(m, 5) is contained in SO(5 + m, C), so
we can give a qutrit interpretation to more vector multiplets for both N = 2 and N = 4, at least in the case
of SO(6n, C) which contains [SL(3, C)]n.
13.3. Alternative Jordan algebra interpretation
“Details that could throw doubt on your interpretation must be given, if you know them. You
must do the best you can – if you know anything at all wrong, or possibly wrong – to explain it.
If you make a theory, for example, and advertise it, or put it out, then you must also put down
all the facts that disagree with it, as well as those that agree with it. There is also a more subtle
problem. When you have put a lot of ideas together to make an elaborate theory, you want to
make sure, when explaining what it ﬁts, that those things it ﬁts are not just the things that gave
you the idea for the theory; but that the ﬁnished theory makes something else come out right, in
addition.
In summary, the idea is to give all of the information to help others to judge the value of
your contribution; not just the information that leads to judgement in one particular direction
or another.”

13.3.1. New interpretation
Our analogy between black holes and quantum information remains, for the moment, just that. We
know of no physics connecting them. In particular, as far as we can tell our analogy is unconnected with
the work of [206, 207, 208, 209, 210, 211, 212] relating black holes and entanglement entropy in ﬁeld theory.
Nevertheless, we have seen that the exceptional group E7 describes the tripartite entanglement of seven
qubits [6, 7] and that the exceptional group E6 describes the bipartite entanglement of three qutrits. In the
E7 case, the quartic Cartan invariant provides both the measure of entanglement and the entropy of the
four-dimensional N = 8 black hole, whereas in the E6 case, the cubic Cartan invariant provides both the
measure of entanglement and the entropy of the ﬁve-dimensional N = 8 black hole.
Moreover, we have seen that similar analogies exist not only for the N = 4 and N = 2 truncations, but
also for the magic N = 2 supergravities in both four and ﬁve dimensions. Murat Gunaydin has suggested
(private communication) that the appearance of octonions and split octonions implies a connection to
quaternionic and/or octonionic quantum mechanics. This was not apparent (at least to us) in the four-
dimensional N = 8 case [6], but the appearance in the ﬁve dimensional magic N = 2 case of SL(3, R),
SL(3, C), SL(3, H) and SL(3, O) is more suggestive.
With this in mind, we provide in this section an alternative interpretation of these relationships between
black hole entropy and entanglement measures in quantum information theory. The black hole charges in
106

the ﬁve-dimensional N = 2 magic R, C, H, O and N = 8 Os (split octonion) supergravities are known to be
described by the elements of a Jordan algebra of degree three JA
3 , where A = R, C, H, O and Os, respectively.
Here we identify them with the 3 × 3 reduced density matrices of two qutrits in quantum mechanics deﬁned
over A.
Recall that in the D = 4 case, one identiﬁes the black hole charges with two qubit state vector coeﬃcients
aAB or three qubit coeﬃcients aABC etc, where A = 0, 1. Whereas in D = 5, one identiﬁes the black hole
charges with two qutrit state vector coeﬃcients aAB etc, where A = 0, 1, 2. In this section, however, we
suggest an alternative interpretation for which the black hole charges are identiﬁed not the a’s themselves
but with components of the reduced density matrices, for example
ρA1A2 = aA1B1a∗
A2B2δB1B2,
(13.7)
where the a’s are deﬁned over the reals, complexes, quaternions and octonions in the case of the N = 2
magic R, C, H, O supergravities and over the split octonions Os in the case of N = 8.
A similar interpretation is given for the six-dimensional magic N = 2 and N = 8 black dyonic string
charges [213], described by Jordan algebras of degree two JA
2 , in terms of the 2×2 reduced density matrices
of two qubits deﬁned over A. This new density matrix interpretation has some advantages over the previous
one, while continuing to relate U-duality invariant black entropies to entanglement measures. However, we
have yet to establish in this approach the connection between three qubit entanglement and the full set of
four-dimensional black hole charges, known to be described by the elements of a Freudenthal triple system
M(J).
This re-interpretation of the black hole/qubit correspondence makes use of the Jordan algebra formulation
of quantum mechanics. Accordingly, in the following section we give a brief overview of Jordan quantum
theory and its relationship to the conventional interpretation, following closely the presentation given in
[214].
13.3.2. The Jordan algebra formulation of quantum mechanics
The advent of the matrix mechanics formulation of quantum theory was shortly followed by a number
of investigations into its possible algebraic generalisations. These forays were principally motivated by a
certain perception, prevalent at the time, that the irrefutable successes of quantum mechanics as applied to
the atom would not be readily extended to the relativistic domain [179]. Chief amongst these attempts was
the use of Jordan algebras, introduced in section 9.2, as a suitable representation of physical observables
[188, 215]. The intention was to place emphasis on observables, as opposed to states, and in doing so abstract
the essential characteristics of the set of Hermitian operators, displacing the Hilbert space from its central
position in the mathematical foundations of the theory [216].
Taken alone, it is not entirely clear that the Jordan identity (9.3) ought to be of any fundamental
importance when representing the algebra of observables. To better understand its physical relevance let
us consider what is expected of such a representation starting from the conventional matrix theory. In this
case observables are represented by Hermitian matrices, possibly of inﬁnite dimension. Central to their
particular suitability in this role is that their eigenvalues are real, that distinct eigenvalues correspond to
distinct orthogonal eigenvectors and that they are formally real in the sense of (9.4). These properties,
coupled with the spectral decomposition theorem, imply that for any polynomial function F and observable
A,
F(A) =
X
m
F(am)Pm,
for
A =
X
m
amPm,
(13.8)
where Pm and am are the projectors and associated eigenvalues, respectively, appearing in the spectral
decomposition of A. The physical signiﬁcance of this statement is that, if a is the value of some observable
A, energy say, for some system in a given state, then one would expect that F(a) be the value of F(A),
energy squared say, for the same state. However, this relies crucially on the power associativity (9.5) of
Hermitian matrices, AmAn = A(m+n) ensures that F(A) is deﬁned unambiguously.
Now, given a commutative, formally real algebra, the Jordan identity then follows from the physically well
motivated assumption of power associativity [179]. Equally, given the same initial assumptions, the Jordan
107

identity implies power associativity. However, Hermitian matrices do not in general commute. Consequently,
the matrix product of two Hermitian matrices does not necessarily yield a third Hermitian matrix. They
do not form a closed algebra under standard matrix multiplication. These considerations, in part, motivate
the deﬁnition of the Jordan product on Hermitian matrices,
A ◦B = 1
2(AB + BA),
(13.9)
which is by deﬁnition commutative (but nonassociative) and closed with respect to Hermiticity. The algebra
of Hermitian matrices, with multiplicative composition deﬁned by (13.9), is closed, formally real, commuta-
tive, power associative and, consequently, satisﬁes the Jordan identity (9.3). In this case, Hermitian matrices
with the Jordan product (13.9), these properties simply amount to a set of identities. However, in seeking
generalisations, one could make the paradigm shift and take the Jordan identity as primary, the Jordan
product emerging as a secondary consequence. That is, we start from a Jordan algebra and require that, in
addition, it be formally real and contain an identity element so as to ensure its suitability as an algebra of
observables [214]. In summary, we axiomatise the algebra of observables A:
1. x ◦y = y ◦x,
2. x ◦(x2 ◦y) = x2 ◦(x ◦y),
3. x2 + y2 + z2 + · · · = 0
=⇒
x = y = z = · · · = 0,
4. ∃1 ∈A s.t. 1 ◦x = x ◦1 = x
∀x ∈A.
Having, to some degree at least, set an axiomatic foundation for the algebra of quantum observables, it
is natural to ask what generalisations beyond the orthodox framework this allows for. This question was
essentially answered by the classiﬁcation of all simple formally real Jordan algebras [179] (see section 9.2).
However, before commenting on the possible alternatives let us address a more immediate issue; how the
Jordan formulation captures the statistics of standard quantum mechanics, an obvious minimal prerequisite.
Having articulated the space of quantum observables in terms of Jordan algebras let us now turn our
attention to the representation of states and the problem of time evolution. We follow closely the presentation
given in [214]. States in quantum theory are represented by rays in a Hilbert space. However, given an
orthonormal basis, {|m⟩} the projection operators,
Pm = |m⟩⟨m|,
(13.10)
which satisfy,
tr Pm = 1,
(13.11)
and
P 2
m = Pm,
(13.12)
correspond to an equivalent representation. Any normalised pure state |ψ⟩may be expressed as a projector,
Pψ = |ψ⟩⟨ψ|, satisfying (13.11) and (13.12).
The expectation value of an observable, represented by a
Hermitian matrix A, is then given by,
⟨A⟩ψ = tr(PψA).
(13.13)
More generally, any state, pure or mixed, may be represented as a Hermitian, trace one, positive semi-deﬁnite
density matrix ρ (c.f. section 3.2) in which case,
⟨A⟩ρ = tr(ρA).
(13.14)
To reproduce these results using the Jordan framework it is necessary to introduce a trace form [214, 217],
tr 1 = ν,
tr bi = 0,
(13.15)
where ν ∈Z and the set {bi} forms a basis for the Jordan algebra such that any element a may be written
as a = aibi, ai ∈R. This deﬁnes a positive deﬁnite bilinear inner product,
⟨bi, bj⟩= 1
ν tr(bi ◦bj) = δij,
(13.16)
108

since one can always choose a basis such that bi ◦bj = δij1 + fijkbk. Any two idempotents10, P1 and P2,
are orthogonal, P1 ◦P2 = 0, if they are orthogonal with respect to the inner product (13.16). A general
idempotent E is said to primitive if it cannot be decomposed as the sum of two orthogonal idempotents.
The highest possible number of orthogonal primitive idempotents is the degree of the algebra and is equal
to the ν appearing in the trace form if one normalises tr E = 1, c.f. (13.11). Any complete set {Ei} of
orthogonal primitive idempotents satisﬁes,
ν
X
i=1
Ei = 1,
(13.17)
constituting a resolution of the identity. Then, in analogy with the spectral decomposition theorem, any
element a in the algebra can be expressed as a linear sum of primitive idempotents,
a =
ν
X
i=1
aiEi(a),
(13.18)
where the maximal set {Ei(a)} depends on particular the element a under question.
It is now possible to represent an arbitrary state ρ in the Jordan formulation,
ρ =
ν
X
i=1
piEi,
where
ν
X
i=1
pi = 1
and
pi ∈[0, 1].
(13.19)
This clearly relates to the density matrix formalism of conventional quantum mechanics: ρ is a positive
semi-deﬁnite, trace one element that satisﬁes ρ2 ≤ρ with equality holding only for pure states i.e. when ρ is
a primitive idempotent [214]. The expectation value of an observable a in the Jordan algebra with respect
to a state ρ is then given by,
⟨a⟩ρ = tr(a ◦ρ).
(13.20)
Hence, this Jordan algebra formulation is essentially equivalent to the density matrix picture of the conven-
tional quantum mechanics [214].
Let us now consider time evolution.
Here the Jordan formalism does depart, to some extent, from
the standard density matrix picture. If we assume that the aﬃne structure of a general density matrix is
preserved by time evolution then,
∂tρ(t) = −i[H, ρ(t)],
(13.21)
where H is the Hamiltonian. An important feature of (13.21) is that it maps pure states into pure states.
Given two Hermitian matrices, A and B, we have,
∂t(AB) = −i[H, AB]
= −i([H, A]B + A[H, B])
= (∂tA)B + A(∂tB).
(13.22)
The diﬀerential evolution operator acts as a derivation as one would expect. Requiring this condition in the
Jordan formulation, so that for any two elements x and y
∂t(x ◦y) = D(x ◦y) = x ◦D(y) + D(x) ◦y = x ◦∂t(y) + ∂t(x) ◦y,
(13.23)
the diﬀerential evolution operator D acts as a derivation of the Jordan algebra c.f. (9.12). Recall, the
set of derivations generates the automorphism group of the algebra (9.11). Hence, the corresponding time
translation operator, Tt1→t2, taking an element, xt1, at time t1, to the corresponding element, xt2, at time
t2, preserves the Jordan product. If
xt1 ◦yt1 = zt1,
(13.24)
10Any algebra element P is said to be idempotent if P 2 = P.
109

then
Tt1→t2(xt1) ◦Tt1→t2(yt1) = Tt1→t2(zt1)
or, equivalently
xt2 ◦yt2 = zt2.
(13.25)
Consequently, Tt1→t2 takes pure states, represented by primitive idempotents Et1, into pure states, as can
be seen from,
Et1 ◦Et1 = Et1 =⇒Tt1→t2(Et1) ◦Tt1→t2(Et1) = Tt1→t2(Et1)
=⇒Et2 ◦Et2 = Et2.
(13.26)
Remarkably, any derivation D(z) can be expressed as,
D(z) = Dx,y(z) = x ◦(z ◦y) −(x ◦z) ◦y,
(13.27)
where x and y are any to two traceless elements. Recalling the deﬁnition of the associator, this implies that
the evolution of any (mixed or pure) state is given by,
∂tρ = [x, ρ, y].
(13.28)
It would seem that, in the Jordan formalism, the associator plays a role equivalent to that of the commutator
in the standard picture. Let us consider the case closest to conventional quantum mechanics, the Jordan
algebra of n × n Hermitian matrices deﬁned over C. In this case (13.28) reduces to,
∂tρ = [[x, y], ρ].
(13.29)
If H = i[x, y] + λ1 then [[x, y], ρ] = −i[H, ρ] and (13.29) reproduces the conventional unitary evolution
equation (13.21). It is as if the Jordan formulation is, in words of [214], the “square root” of standard
theory.
In light of this relationship between the Jordan formulation and the density matrix formalism, the
simple Jordan algebras of n × n Hermitian matrices over the associative division algebras seem to oﬀer
an obvious generalisation.
However, it would seem that they simply amount to conventional quantum
theory deﬁned over R, C or H [218]. This leaves the exceptional octonionic example. In this case a Hilbert
space formulation is not possible due to the nonassociative nature of the octonions. It has, however, been
shown that the usual axioms of quantum theory may be satisﬁed by taking a more abstract “propositional”
approach [194, 214, 217, 219, 220].
13.3.3. D = 5 and Jordan algebras of degree three JA
3
Let us compare J3(P) of section 9.4 with the 2 qutrit reduced matrices ρA and ρB
ρA = TrB|Ψ⟩⟨Ψ|,
ρB = TrA|Ψ⟩⟨Ψ|,
(13.30)
which are also 3 × 3 hermitian and transform in the same way, at least in the R and C cases:
(ρA)A1A2 = aA1B1a∗
A2B2δB1B2,
(ρB)B1B2 = aA1B1a∗
A2B2δA1A2.
(13.31)
Making contact with the H, O and Os cases, however, would require going to quaternionic or octonionic
quantum mechanics. The two qutrit system (Alice and Bob) is then described by the state
|Ψ⟩= aAB|AB⟩,
(13.32)
where A = 0, 1, 2, so the Hilbert space has dimension 9, 18, 36, 72 for A = R, C, H, O. The aAB transforms
as a (3, 3) under SL(3, A)A × SL(3, A)B.
From section 5 the bipartite entanglement is measured by the 2-tangle
τ2(AB) = 27| det ρ|.
(13.33)
We now propose to identify the black hole charges J with components of the reduced density matrix ρ rather
than the state coeﬃcient a!
Recall that SL(3, A) has dimension 8,16,35,78 for A = R, C, H, O. Note that the fundamental reps have
real dimension 3 dim A: 3,6,12,24 but 24 is not a rep of E6.
110

13.3.4. D = 6 and Jordan algebras of degree two JA
2
The elements of the Jordan algebras JA
2 of degree two, are 2 × 2 hermitian real A matrices:
J2(A) =
R1
A
A
R2

,
(13.34)
where Ri are real numbers and where A ∈A = R, C, H, O, Os. They transform as the (dim A + 2) represen-
tation of SL(2, A). In other words as the 3,4,6,10,10 of SO(2, 1), SO(3, 1), SO(5, 1), SO(9, 1), SO(5, 5),
respectively as in Table 34. These are the symmetries and dyonic black string charge representations of the
magic N = 2 and N = 8 supergravities. In all cases the black string entropy is
S = π
p
| det J2|,
(13.35)
where
det J2 = R1R2 −AA.
(13.36)
Let us compare J2(A) with the 2 qubit reduced matrices ρA and ρB
ρA = TrB|Ψ⟩⟨Ψ|,
ρB = TrA|Ψ⟩⟨Ψ|,
(13.37)
which are also 2×2 hermitian and transform in the same way. Generalising to R, C, H, O, Os, the two qubit
system (Alice and Bob) is then described by the state
|Ψ⟩= aAB|AB⟩,
(13.38)
where A = 0, 1, so the Hilbert space has dimension 4, 8, 16, 32, 32 for A = R, C, H, O, Os.
The aAB
transforms as a (2, 2) under SL(2, A)A × SL(2, A)B. The bipartite entanglement is measured by the 2-
tangle
τ2(AB) = 4| det ρ|.
(13.39)
We now propose to identify the black hole charges J with components of the reduced density matrix ρ
rather than the state coeﬃcient a!
Recall that SL(2, A) has dimension (dim A+2)(dim A+1)/2 namely 3,6,15,45,45 for A = R, C, H, O, Os.
Note that the fundamental reps have real dimension 2 dim A namely 2,4,8,16.
13.3.5. D = 4 and Freudenthal triples M(J)
Recall from section 9.6 that in D = 4 the black hole charges are described by the Freudenthal triple
system [30] realised as 2 × 2 “matrices”. Unfortunately, we do not know how to proceed with the new
interpretation in D = 4.
13.3.6. Advantages and drawbacks
This new density matrix interpretation has some advantages and some drawbacks:
Advantages:
1. It solves the problem of the apparently unconventional Hilbert space appearing in (12.16). Now
it is just that of two qutrits, albeit with unconventional quantum mechanics. There is no need to
describe it as a subspace of 7-dits.
2. The mismatch between real black hole charges and complex state coeﬃcients now disappears.
R, C, H, O, Os charges correspond to R, C, H, O, Os density matrices.
3. It works in D = 6 as well as D = 5. The old interpretation does not admit the 10 of SO(5, 5)and
so cannot explain black strings in D = 6.
111

4. In contrast to the old interpretation, this new interpretation may be extended to N = 2 super-
gravity coupled to an arbitrary number of supermultiplets which also have an interpretation in
terms of reducible Jordan algebras of degree 3 [30].
Drawbacks:
1. It seems to contradict our previous interpretation of identifying charges with aAB or aABC coeﬃ-
cients which seemed to work well, at least for the N = 2 STU model and its N = 8 generalisations.
Moreover the observations that E7 ⊃[SL(2)]7 and E6 ⊃[SL(3)]3 now seem to play no role.
2. There seems no obvious way to interpret the Freudenthal triples in terms of three qubit density
matrices, and so D = 4 remains a mystery.
3. Quaternionic [218] and octonionic quantum mechanics [219] seem further removed from the
real world, as the following example illustrates.
Consider a single qudit state deﬁned over
A = R, C, H, O
|Ψ⟩= aA|A⟩,
(13.40)
where A = 0, 1, 2, . . . , d −1. The dimension of the Hilbert space is
dim H = d dim A,
(13.41)
and the d × d density matrix
ρAB = aAa∗
B,
(13.42)
belongs to a d-dimensional Jordan algebra with
dim Jd = d + 1
2d(d −1) dim A
(13.43)
real parameters, as in Table 34.

Table 34: Jordan algebra dimensions.
Now consider a state of n qudits
|Ψ⟩= aA1A2···An|A1A2 · · · An⟩.
(13.44)
The dimension of the Hilbert space is
dim H = dn dim A,
(13.45)
and the dn × dn density matrix,
ρA1A2···AnB1B2···Bn = aA1A2···Ana∗
B1B2···Bn,
(13.46)
belongs to a dn-dimensional Jordan algebra with
dim Jdn = dn + 1
2dn(dn −1) dim A,
(13.47)
real parameters.
One might expect that an n-qudit state would be described by the same number of parameters as the
tensor product of n single qudits [221].
[dim Jd]n = dim Jdn.
(13.48)
but this works only in the complex case.

14. WRAPPED BRANES AS QUBITS
14.1. D = 4 black hole origin of qubit two-valuedness
In section 7 we established a correspondence between the tripartite entanglement measure of three qubits
and the macroscopic entropy of the four-dimensional 8-charge STU black hole of supergravity. In this section
we consider the conﬁgurations of intersecting D3-branes, whose wrapping around the six compact dimensions
T 6 provides the microscopic string-theoretic interpretation of the charges, and associate the three-qubit basis
vectors |ABC⟩, (A, B, C = 0 or 1) with the corresponding 8 wrapping cycles. In particular, we relate a well-
known fact of quantum information theory, that the most general real three-qubit state can be parameterised
by four real numbers and an angle, to a well-known fact of string theory, that the most general STU black
hole can be described by four D3-branes intersecting at an angle.
Macroscopically, S is just one quarter the area of the event horizon of the black hole. To give a microscopic
derivation [43] we need to invoke ten-dimensional string theory whose associated Dp-branes wrapping around
the six compact dimensions provide the string-theoretic interpretation of the black holes.
A Dp-brane
wrapped around a p-dimensional cycle of the compact directions (x4, x5, x6, x7, x8, x9) looks like a D0-brane
from the four-dimensional (x0, x1, x2, x3) perspective [222, 223, 224, 225].
The microscopic analysis is not unique since there are many ways of embedding the STU model in
string/M-theory, but a useful one from our point of view is that of four D3-branes of Type IIB wrapping the
(579), (568), (478), (469) cycles of T 6 with wrapping numbers N0, N1, N2, N3 and intersecting over a string
[226]. The wrapped circles are denoted by crosses and the unwrapped circles by noughts as shown in Table 35.
This picture is consistent with the interpretation of the 4-charge black hole as bound state at threshold of
four 1-charge black holes [135, 136, 19]. The ﬁfth parameter θ is obtained [227, 228] by allowing the N3
brane to intersect at an angle which induces additional eﬀective charges on the (579), (569), (479) cycles.
The microscopic calculation of the entropy consists of taking the logarithm of the number of microstates
and yields the same result as the macroscopic one [229].
To make the black hole/qubit correspondence we associate the three T 2 with the SL(2)A × SL(2)B ×
SL(2)C of the three qubits Alice, Bob, and Charlie. The 8 diﬀerent cycles then yield 8 diﬀerent basis vectors
|ABC⟩as in the last column of Table 35, where |0⟩corresponds to xo and |1⟩to ox. To wrap or not to wrap;
that is the qubit. We see immediately that we reproduce the ﬁve parameter three-qubit state |Ψ⟩of (4.63):
|Ψ⟩= −N3 cos2 θ|001⟩−N2|010⟩+ N3 sin θ cos θ|011⟩
−N1|100⟩−N3 sin θ cos θ|101⟩+ (N0 + N3 sin2 θ)|111⟩.
(14.1)
Note that the GHZ state of Table 8 describes four D3-branes intersecting over a string. Performing a T-
duality transformation, one obtains a Type IIA interpretation with zero D6-branes, N0 D0-branes, N1, N2,
N3 D4-branes plus eﬀective D2-brane charges, where |0⟩now corresponds to xx and |1⟩to oo.

14.2. D = 5 black hole origin of qutrit three-valuedness
All this suggests that the analogy [8] between D = 5 black holes and qutrits, described in section 12.2,
should involve the choice of wrapping an M2- brane around one of three circles in T 3. This is indeed the
case, with the number of qutrits being two.
The 9-charge N = 2, D = 5 black hole may also be embedded in the N = 8 theory in diﬀerent ways. The
most convenient microscopic description is that of three M2-branes [230, 226] wrapping the (58), (69), (710)
cycles of the T 6 compactiﬁcation of D = 11 M-theory, with wrapping numbers N0, N1, N2 as in Table 36.
To make the black hole/qutrit correspondence we associate the two T 3 with the SL(3)A × SL(3)B of the
two qutrits Alice and Bob. The 9 diﬀerent cycles then yield the 9 diﬀerent basis vectors |AB⟩as in the last
column of Table 36, where |0⟩corresponds to xoo, |1⟩to oxo and |2⟩to oox. We see immediately that we
reproduce the three parameter two-qutrit state |Ψ⟩of (5.16):
|Ψ⟩= N0|00⟩+ N1|11⟩+ N2|22⟩.
(14.2)
Note that this rank 3 Bell state describes three M2-branes intersecting over a point.
The black hole entropy, both macroscopic and microscopic, turns out to be given by the 2-tangle
S = 2π

| det aAB|,
(14.3)

Table 36: Two qutrit interpretation of the 9-charge D = 5 black hole from M2-branes in D = 11 wrapping around the upper
three cycles of T 6 with wrapping numbers N0, N1, N2. Note that they intersect over a point.
is, in fact, a quantum information theoretic interpretation of the 27 charge N = 8, D = 5 black hole in
terms of a Hilbert space consisting of three copies of the two-qutrit Hilbert space [8].
It relies on the
decomposition E6(6) ⊃[SL(3)]3 and admits the interpretation of a bipartite entanglement of three qutrits,
with the entanglement measure given by Cartan’s cubic E6(6) invariant. Once again, however, because the
generating solution depends on the same three parameters as the 9-charge model, its classiﬁcation of states
will exactly parallel that of the usual two-qutrit system. Indeed, the Cartan invariant reduces to det aAB in
a canonical basis [157].
The microscopic interpretation of the D = 5 black string and its QI correspondence proceeds in a similar
way by wrapping three M5-branes around T 6. We simply swap the crosses and the noughts in Table 36.

15. OUTSTANDING PROBLEMS
15.1. For quantum information theory
The Fano plane has played a crucial role in our description of the 3-way entanglement of seven qubits.
It also ﬁnds application in switching networks that can connect any phone to any other phone. It is the
3-switching network for 7 numbers. However there also exists a 4-switching network for 13 numbers, a
5-switching network for 21 numbers, and generally an (n + 1)-switching network for (n2 + n + 1) numbers
corresponding to the projective planes of order n [23, 24]. It would be worthwhile pursuing the corresponding
quantum bit entanglements.
Exceptional groups, such as E7(7), have featured in supergravity, string theory, M-theory and other
speculative attempts at uniﬁcation of the fundamental forces. However, it is unusual to ﬁnd an exceptional
group appearing in the context of qubit entanglement. Can this be subject to experimental test?
What is the signiﬁcance of the coset constructions, such as E8/[SL(2)]8 that describes the 4-way entan-
glement of eight qubits?
Cayley’s hyperdeterminant provides a good measure of entanglement by virtue of being an entanglement
monotone. We intend to return elsewhere to the issue of whether Cartan’s E7 invariant is also monotonic.
Jordan algebras were ﬁrst introduced in the 1930s by Jordan, Wigner and von Neumann to describe
the diﬀerent possible versions of quantum mechanics: deﬁned over the real, complex, quaternionic and
octonionic numbers. As we have seen, they also make their appearance in black hole physics which we have,
in turn, related to quantum mechanics. Does this mean that we can come full circle and reformulate the
qubit entanglements in terms of quaternionic and/or octonionic quantum mechanics?
The D = 5 black hole, related to two qutrits, and the D = 4 black hole, related to three qubits, are
themselves related through the 3-dimensional Jordan algebras over the octonions and the Freudenthal triple
systems. Indeed there exists a 5D/4D black hole correspondence that relates the two but involves black
holes carrying angular momentum and Taub-NUT charge [231, 232]. Is there a QI interpretation of rotating
black holes and NUT charge? What does this imply for the relation of qubits to qutrits? Moreover, we have
conﬁned out attention to asymptotically ﬂat black holes. What about those that are asymptotically anti-de
Sitter (AdS)?
Although there are no black holes with non-zero entropy in D ≥6 dimensions, there are black strings
and other intersecting brane conﬁgurations with entropies given by U-duality invariants. Do they have a
qubit interpretation?
A pair of entangled qubits may be exploited to perform computational tasks beyond the capability of
any classical device. What is more, a three-qubit entangled state can then be used achieve tasks surpassing
that of the 2-qubit case. Can we go beyond these examples utilising the special properties of the tripartite
entanglement of seven qubits? One possibility is the role of the Fano plane in error-correcting codes.
The tripartite entanglement of three qubits is subject to experimental test and provides a striking version
of Bell’s theorem on non-locality versus realism [95]. Can we generalise these experiments to the tripartite
entanglement of seven qubits described above by the Fano plane and thereby demonstrate the eﬀects of
octonions in the laboratory?
15.2. For M-theory
The STU black hole entropy is described by the 2 × 2 × 2 hyperdeterminant, but there is a much richer
mathematical structure behind the theory of more general hyperdeterminants [27] which also enters the
classiﬁcation of entanglement invariants [21, 113, 78, 233]. Do they have a role in M-theory?
We have seen that the SL(2) × SO(6, 6) Cartan invariant for the 24 NS-NS charges is just the SL(2)3
invariant Cayley’s hyperdeterminant when deﬁned over the imaginary quaternions. Is this just a property
of the charges or does this mean that the N = 4 supergravity is, in some sense, just the N = 2 STU
supergravity deﬁned over the imaginary quaternions? If so, does this mean that the NS-NS sector of D = 10
string theory compactiﬁed on T 6 with U-duality SL(2) × SO(6, 6) is somehow equivalent to the NS-NS
sector D = 6 string theory compactiﬁed on T 2 with U-duality SL(2)3, when deﬁned over the imaginary
quaternions?
115

The E7 Cartan invariant for the full 56 charges, including the 32 R-R, is not simply given by Cayley’s
hyperdeterminant over the imaginary octonions but is nevertheless given by a similar expression quartic in
the imaginary octonions. So one could again ask whether this just a property of the charges or does this
mean that the N = 8 supergravity is, in some sense, related to the N = 2 STU supergravity deﬁned over
the imaginary octonions. If so, does this mean that D = 11 M-theory compactiﬁed on T 7 with U-duality
E7 is somehow related to the NS-NS sector D = 6 string theory compactiﬁed on T 2 with U-duality SL(2)3,
when deﬁned over the imaginary octonions? We are encouraged in these speculations by recent independent
advances by both mathematicians [28, 29] and physicists [6, 7] that show, using the Fano heptads, that E7
has a natural structure of an O-graded algebra, compatible with its action on the minimal 56-dimensional
representation.
15.3. For their inter-relation
A third physical application of Cayley’s hyperdeterminant is that of providing the Lagrangian of the
Nambu-Goto string in spacetime signature (2, 2) [234, 235].
(It is then possible to generalise to an E7
invariant string using the Cartan invariant.) Is this related to its other two applications in black holes and
quantum information theory?
The Type IIB microscopic analysis of the black hole has provided an explanation for the appearance
of the qubit two-valuedness (0 or 1) that was lacking in the previous treatments: the brane can wrap one
circle or the other in each T 2. The number of qubits is three because of the number of string theory extra
dimensions is six. Moreover, the ﬁve parameters of the real three-qubit state are seen to correspond to four
D3-branes intersecting at an angle. Similar results hold for the two-qutrit system. Can one now ﬁnd an
underlying physical justiﬁcation for (1.1) relating the 3-tangle to the black hole entropy?

A. TRANSVECTANTS AND CAYLEY’S HYPERDETERMINANT
Cayley’s original treatment of the hyperdeterminant [22] made use of a homogeneous polynomial U of
third degree in six variables with eight coeﬃcients a to h:
U =
a x1y1z1 + b x1y1z2 + c x1y2z1 + d x1y2z2
+ e x2y1z1 + f x2y1z2 + g x2y2z1 + h x2y2z2.
(A.1)
Successive application of diﬀerential operators reduced U to an expression called u - an example of a
hyperdeterminant (cf section 4.3.2):
u =
a2h2 + b2g2 + c2f 2 + d2e2
−2 (abgh + acfh + aedh + bcfg + bdeg + cdef)
+ 4 (adfg + bceh)
= (ah −bg −cf + de)2 + 4(ad −bc)(fg −eh)
= (ah −bg −de + cf)2 + 4(af −be)(dg −ch)
= (ah −cf −de + bg)2 + 4(ag −ce)(df −bh),
(A.2)
To begin with the diﬀerentials were expressed solely in terms of what we would today recognise as “momen-
tum space” duals to the x, y, z variables. This developed into the traditional symbolic method or classical
umbral calculus. Cayley’s subsequent treatment made use of determinants of these dual variables, and one
of the notations for the determinants was the symbol Omega ∥Ω∥.
These were combined into a single
operator called the hyperdeterminant symbol □so that u = □U. Cayley eventually moved on from his
hyperdeterminant theory and after a sesquicentennial hiatus the work was reestablished in [27].
A connection between the hyperdeterminant theory and entanglement measures lies in classical invariant
theory [236, 233, 237, 201, 114, 80, 238]. The objects of interest are forms (homogeneous polynomials), and
the functions of these forms that are “unchanged” in some sense by transformations of the variables - for
this purpose it is instructive to consider the more general notion of a covariant11. Covariants of a form
are functions J(⃗a, ⃗x) in the form’s variables ⃗x and coeﬃcients ⃗a that are unchanged under general linear
transformations modulo the determinant ∆of the transformation:
J(⃗a, ⃗x) = ∆wJ′(⃗a′, ⃗x′).
(A.3)
Here, w is called the weight of the covariant.
An invariant is simply a covariant in the special case in
which there is no ⃗x dependence. When even the determinant factor drops out (w = 0) the covariant (or
invariant) is called absolute. Given a set of forms depending on the same variables one may also construct
joint covariants. These depend on the coeﬃcients of all the forms, but satisfy the same transformation
formula as ordinary covariants.
One can generate covariants of a form via a process known as transvection, which is itself based upon
the Omega process. The mth order Omega process with respect to an m × m matrix of variables V is a
diﬀerential operator deﬁned as
Ω:=

∂Vmm

,
= P
π∈Sm(−)π Qm

∂
∂Viπ(i) .
(A.4)
For example, a second order Omega process would be
∂
∂V11∂V22 −
∂
∂V12∂V21 . We will call the matrix of which
Ωis the determinant the Omega matrix Ω. In conjunction with a set P consisting of p polynomials, the
11We rely heavily upon the notation of [236] throughout this appendix.
117

Omega process may be used to form transvectants. The essential property of the Omega matrix that permits
this construction is the fact that under a simultaneous general linear transformation Λ of all the variables,
Omega transforms as Ω7→(Λ−1)TΩ, so that the Omega process satisﬁes
Ω7→(det Λ)−1Ω,
(A.5)
making it an example of an invariant process. Other invariant processes are the scaling and polarisation
processes
Polarisation:
π(⃗x, ⃗y) := xi ∂
∂yi ,
Scaling:
σ(⃗x)
:= π(⃗x, ⃗x),
(A.6)
which obey identities with the Omega process. The covariants resulting from their application ﬁnd alterna-
tive expression as the partial transvectants discussed brieﬂy below.
Deﬁning P(−→
Vi) := P(Vi1, . . . , Vip), we use the tensor product notation Np
i=1 Pi to denote P1(−→
V1), . . . , Pp(−→
Vp).
A complete n-transvectant is then deﬁned by
(P1, . . . , Pp)(n) := tr Ωn Np
i=1 Pi,
(A.7)
where tr sets all vectors of variables to be equal: −→
V1 = −→
V2 = · · · = −→
Vp. Under the exchange of any of the Pi,
the transvectant picks up a factor of (−)n. For a complete n-transvectant, the dimension v of the −→
Vi vectors
satisﬁes p = v = m. However more generally, v can be any integer multiple of p: p = v/d. In such case, the
polynomials are expected to be multiforms; that is, while the polynomials accept p × d arguments, they are
homogeneous in each of the d sets of v variables. Separate Omega processes can then operate on the d sets
of variables to form a complete (n1, . . . , nd)-transvectant:
(P1, . . . , Pp)(n1,...,nd) := tr Ωn1
1 · · · Ωnd
d
Np
i=1 Pi.
(A.8)
When the Pi have multiweights (w11, . . . , w1d), . . . , (wp1, . . . , wpd) the resulting covariant has multiweight
(w11 + · · · + wp1 + n1, . . . , w1d + · · · + wpd + nd). In the multidegree case, transvectants satisfy p = v/d = m,
but it is possible to generalise yet further to partial transvectants in both the single and multidegree cases.
The Omega processes of partial transvectants have variables excluded by deleting rows and columns in the
full pd×pd Omega matrix. Partial transvectants subsume the scaling and polarisation processes so that the
polynomial covariants of a set of forms can be obtained using only linear aggregates of partial transvectants.
In all cases, transvectants obey the inequality
p ≥v/d = m,
(A.9)
with saturation for a complete transvectant.
An elementary and eminently recognisable example of a transvectant would be the discriminant of a
quadratic form:
P(x, y) = ax2 + bxy + cy2,
b2 −4ac ≡−1
2(P, P)(2),
(A.10)
which is an invariant. This is an example of a Hessian covariant H[P]:
H[P] := 1
v!(P, . . . , P
|
{z
}
v
)(2) ≡det

∂P
∂xi∂xj

.
(A.11)
Another example is the Jacobian determinant J[P1, . . . , Pv]:
J[P1, . . . , Pv] := (P1, . . . , Pv)(1) ≡det
∂Pi
∂xj

,
(A.12)
which is familiar from the change of variables in integration. As this is a ﬁrst transvectant it is actually
simpler than the example of the Hessian covariant. A yet simpler case is the zeroth transvectant of a set of
forms, which is merely the product of the forms.
118

In similar fashion, transvection can generate the entanglement measures of a three-qubit system using
the covariants of a single polynomial ψ in six variables [80]:
ψ := aijkxiyjzk
=
a0x0y0z0 + a1x0y0z1 + a2x0y1z0 + a3x0y1z1
+ a4x1y0z0 + a5x1y0z1 + a6x1y1z0 + a7x1y1z1,
(A.13)
where the usual binary to decimal conversion has been performed on the coeﬃcients. The form ψ is in fact
a triform of tridegree (1, 1, 1), which is to say it is a form of degree one in each of the ⃗x, ⃗y,⃗z variables when
the other two are ﬁxed. This immediately suggests that one may form (n1, n2, n3)-transvectants of ψ, the
ﬁrst of which is trivially ψ itself. The next covariants of interest arise from Hessian-like transvectants whose
degree-sum is two:
H1 := 1
2(ψ, ψ)(0,1,1),
H2 := 1
2(ψ, ψ)(1,0,1),
H3 := 1
2(ψ, ψ)(1,1,0).
(A.14)
Note that the Hi transvectants are of degree three with two polynomials and six variables, hence they are
complete and the Omega processes are second order. Written out more explicitly these are:
H1 = (a0x0 + a4x1) (a3x0 + a7x1) −(a1x0 + a5x1) (a2x0 + a6x1)
= (a0a3 −a1a2) x2
0 + ( a3a4 −a2a5 −a1a6 + a0a7) x0x1 + (a4a7 −a5a6) x2
1,
H2 = (a0y0 + a2y1) (a5y0 + a7y1) −(a1y0 + a3y1) (a4y0 + a6y1)
= (a0a5 −a1a4) y2
0 + (−a3a4 + a2a5 −a1a6 + a0a7) y0y1 + (a2a7 −a3a6) y2
1,
H3 = (a0z0 + a1z1) (a6z0 + a7z1) −(a2z0 + a3z1) (a4z0 + a5z1)
= (a0a6 −a2a4) z2
0 + (−a3a4 −a2a5 + a1a6 + a0a7) z0z1 + (a1a7 −a3a5) z2
1.
(A.15)
The Hi are closely related to the 2-tangles of a three qubit system. Next there is a single Jacobian-like
covariant which may be obtained from each of the three Hi
T := (ψ, H1)(1,0,0)
≡(ψ, H2)(0,1,0)
≡(ψ, H3)(0,0,1).
(A.16)
This is a large expression when written in full:
T =
( 2a1a2a4 −a0a3a4 −a0a2a5 −a0a1a6 +
a2
0a7 ) x0y0z0

+ (−2a3a5a6 + a3a4a7 + a2a5a7 + a1a6a7 −
a0a2
7 ) x1y1z1,
(A.17)
which is related to the Kempe invariant [71]. Finally there is the hyperdeterminant invariant whose absolute
value is proportional to the 3-tangle
∆:= 1
2(T, ψ)(1,1,1) ≡Det a.
(A.18)
Expressed entirely in terms of ψ this is 1
4((ψ, (ψ, ψ)(0,1,1))(1,0,0), ψ)(1,1,1). Interpreting the x, y, z variables
as qubits, the LU-invariants can be generated by the self-overlaps of the six polynomials ψ, H1, H2, H3, T,
and ∆. According to [80], there is an additional LU-invariant ⟨∆ψ2|T 2⟩.
119

Rather than generate the three-qubit invariants through iterated complete transvection, they may alter-
natively be obtained as partial transvectants. In this case the Omega processes are partitioned into three
sets, the ﬁrst of which act on the x variables, the second on the y’s and the third on the z’s (remembering
that each polynomial’s arguments are initially unique and only reduce to x, y, z when the trace is applied).
In the case of complete transvectants, there was no ambiguity in the variables involved in the Omega process,
but now there is the freedom to choose which polynomials the processes are associated with. Recalling that
v/d = m, we ﬁnd that since the Omega processes for our triform (A.13) are second order, the processes need
two labels referring to the polynomials involved (and of course there must be at least two polynomials since
p ≥m). Consequently, we may adopt the notation:
Ωαβ := det
∂xα
∂yα
∂xβ
∂yβ

,
(A.19)
where x and y correspond to x0, x1 if the process appears in the ﬁrst partition, y0, y1 if it appears in the
second partition, etc. There is also a bracket notation we may employ:
[αβ] := Ωαβ ≡−[βα],
(A.20)
where the LHS is called a bracket factor of the second kind12. While Cayley introduced the Omega notation,
he also employed αβ for bracket factors. The covariants that are written in terms of bracket factors are
referred to as bracket polynomials and we can rewrite three-qubit covariants as bracket polynomials. To
begin with, the Hi are given by
H1 = 1
2 tr (
)([12])([12]) ψ ⊗ψ,
H2 = 1
2 tr ([12])(
)([12]) ψ ⊗ψ,
H3 = 1
2 tr ([12])([12])(
) ψ ⊗ψ,
(A.21)
where in each case there is a single empty partition (cf (A.15)). Next, T can be obtained in multiple ways
as
T = tr ([12])([23])([23]) ψ⊗3 = −tr ([23])([12])([12]) ψ⊗3
= tr ([23])([12])([23]) ψ⊗3 = −tr ([12])([23])([12]) ψ⊗3
= tr ([23])([23])([12]) ψ⊗3 = −tr ([12])([12])([23]) ψ⊗3,
(A.22)
where the new polynomial is linked to the remaining ones in the previously empty slot of any of the Hi.
Finally, the hyperdeterminant is realised as
∆= 1
2 tr ([12][34])([14][23])([14][23]) ψ⊗4.
(A.23)
There are of course several bracket polynomials corresponding to the hyperdeterminant, and they are ob-
tained by linking the previously untouched polynomial in each slot with the new polynomial using the
appropriate bracket factor.
12The bracket factors of the ﬁrst and third kinds are also determinants, but involving the variables themselves. The former
are denoted (α⃗x) and correspond to scaling processes, whereas the latter look like JαβK and are ordinary determinants of
variables.

B. SUPERGRAVITY COMPACTIFICATIONS
B.1. N = 1, D = 11
In this appendix we look at superalgebras [32] for M-theory in D = 11, Type IIA theory on D = 10 and
Type IIB theory in D=10 in order to see how the central charges give rise to the black hole charges in D = 4
after compactiﬁcation on either T 7 or T 6. To get the right central charges, we need to know the symmetry
properties of Dirac matrices for SO(1, 2n) and SO(1, 2n −1) [239] which obey the Cliﬀord algebra:
{ΓA, ΓB} = 2ηAB,
(B.1)
where A = 0, . . . , 2n −1 and η = diag(−1, +1, . . . , +1).
(ΓM1M2···MrC)αβ = (−1)(n−r)(n−r+1)/2(ΓM1M2···MrC)βα,
(B.2)
where C is the charge conjugation matrix
C = Γn+1Γn+2 · · · Γ2n−1Γ0.
(B.3)
Here the symmetric gammas are ΓMC, ΓMNC and ΓMNP QRC so the D = 11 supersymmetry algebra is

(B.4)
That is, there is a two-form and a ﬁve-form charge. The total number of components of all charges on the
RHS of (B.4) is
11 + 55 + 462 = 528,
(B.5)
which is, algebraically, the maximum possible number since the LHS is a symmetric 32 × 32 matrix.

The supersymmetry charges are 32 component non-chiral D = 10 spinors, so the maximum number of
components of charges on the RHS is 528, and this maximum is realised by the above algebra since
10 + 1 + 10 + 45 + 210 + 252 = 528.
(B.21)
Note that in this case the Γ11 matrix distinguishes between the term involving the 10-momentum P and
that involving the one-form charge carried by the type IIA superstring. This means that on compactiﬁcation
to D = 4 we obtain an additional six electric central charges from this source, relative to the N = 1 case.
These are balanced by an additional six magnetic charges due to the fact that the ﬁve-form charge is no
longer self-dual as it is in the N = 1 case. Thus, there is now a total of 24 D = 4 central charges carried
by particles of KK, string, or ﬁvebrane origin. These are the charged particles in the NS-NS sector of the
superstring theory.

C. MORE HIDDEN SYMMETRIES
The SLOCC group for an n-qudit state is given by G = [SL(d, C)]n, but subspaces of the dn-dimensional
Hilbert space may display hidden symmetries not contained in G. We have already seen that these include
an E7(C) symmetry of a 56 dimensional subspace of seven qutrits and E6(C) symmetry of a 27-dimensional
subspace of three 7-dits. Here we explore some more possibilities. We thank Peter Levay for his input on
early stages of these results.
C.1. SL(2) decompositions
Consider for example the groups E8(C), E7(C), SO(12, C), SO(8, C), Sp(6, C) and Sp(4, C) and their

D. DISCRETE SYMMETRY OF THE FANO PLANE
It ought to be clear by now that the Fano plane plays a central role in the seven qubit interpretation of
N = 8 black holes. It is therefore natural ask how the symmetries of the Fano plane are manifested in the
56 dimensional seven qubit state.
D.1. Projective geometry, the Fano plane and PSL(2, F7)
Let V0 = V (n + 1, F)/{0} be a n + 1-dimensional vector space, deﬁned over a ﬁeld F, with the additive
identity 0 removed. Note, F may be a ﬁnite ﬁeld with characteristic q, in which case we denote it by Fq.
The n-dimensional projective space over F, which we write as PG(n, F), is the space of equivalence classes
deﬁned by the relation, x ∼y iﬀx = αy, where α ∈F/{0} and x, y ∈V0. The set of projectivities13
of PG(n, Fq) is the projective general linear group PGL(n + 1, Fq), i.e. the group of non-singular linear
transformations on V0 up to an overall multiplicative factor (see for example, [240]).
The Fano plane is the projective plane over the ﬁnite ﬁeld of order two, PG(2, F2). It is the smallest
example of a projective plane. In this case the projective general linear group, PGL(3, F2), is isomorphic
to the projective special linear group PSL(3, F2)14, the set of determinant one projectivities. In fact, in
this particular instance, we have a second useful isomorphism, PSL(3, F2) ≃PSL(2, F7). PSL(2, F7) is
second smallest ﬁnite non-abelian simple group, after the alternating group A5, with 168 elements. It has
many guises, but, perhaps most signiﬁcantly, it is the automorphism group of the Klein quartic. Further,
it is the only ﬁnite simple subgroup of SU(3) and consequently, in light of the recently measured neutrino
mixing patterns, it has been receiving increasing attention as a candidate ﬁnite non-abelian ﬂavour group
[241, 242].
D.2. The 56-dimensional representation
PSL(2, F7) admits a two generator presentation [243, 242],
⟨s, t | s2 = t3 = (st)7 = [s, t]4 = e ⟩,
(D.1)
where the commutator, [s, t], is deﬁned as s−1t−1st.
It has six conjugacy classes and, therefore six irreps, as summarised in Table 40. It has a convenient
action deﬁned on the Fano plane given by the permutation of its points. For example, we may consider the
permutations,
sfano = (AC)(B)(DE)(F)(G),
tfano = (ADB)(C)(EFG),
(D.2)
which are automorphisms of the un-oriented Fano plane. This yields a 7 dimensional real representation for
which it is easily veriﬁed that (D.1) is satisﬁed. This representation is reducible,
7fano →1 + 6,
(D.3)
13A projectivity is a linear bijection PG(n, F) →PG(n, F) that preserves incidence.
14More generally, PGL(n, Fq) ≃PSL(n, Fq) iﬀgcd(n + 1, q) = 1.

order of the elements in that class. A simple representative for each class is given in the parentheses. Note that geometrical
interpretation of the 6 is given by its action on the Fano plane [241]. The ﬁnal row corresponds to the compound characters
of the reducible 56 dimensional representation described here.

as can be checked from its characters. The Fano planes initial overall labelling is associated with the singlet
[241].
These permutations also interchange the lines of the Fano plane and, consequently, may be considered
as permutations of the points of the dual Fano plane,
sdualfano = (ab)(ce)(d)(f)(g),
tdualfano = (a)(bcg)(efd).
(D.4)
This Fano plane representation may be used to build a 56-dimensional representation of the PSL(2, F7)
generators, denoted s56 and t56, acting on our particular seven-qubit state,
|Ψ⟩=
aABD|ABD⟩+ bBCE|BCE⟩+ cCDF |CDF⟩+ dDEG|DEG⟩
+ eEF A|EFA⟩+ fF GB|FGB⟩+ gGAC|GAC⟩,
(D.5)
which leaves quartic entanglement measure, I4, invariant.
Begin by considering the action on both the Fano and dual Fano planes together,
aABD
s7−→bCBE ,
aABD
t7−→aBDA,
bBCE
s7−→aBAD,
bBCE
t7−→cDCF ,
cCDF
s7−→eAEF ,

t7−→gCAG,
dDEG
s7−→dEDG,

t7−→eAF E ,

s7−→cDF C,
eEF A
t7−→fF GB,
fF GB
s7−→fF GB,
fF GB
t7−→dGED,
gGAC
s7−→gGCA,
gGAC
t7−→bEBC ,
(D.6)
where sfano and sdualfano (tfano and tdualfano) respectively permute the upper and lower case letters (points
and lines) in a consistent manner. Note, however, that the points on each line are permuted away from their
original ordering, for example, in (D.6) we ﬁnd aABD 7→bCBE as opposed to bBCE. There is, in addition,
a corresponding action on the quadrangles of the dual Fano plane. Label each quadrangle by its excluded
qubit as in Table 41. Using this labelling and the composition rule,
(bcdf) · (cdeg) = (efgb),
(D.7)
where the common letters are “contracted” over, reproduces the Fano plane. Consequently, the quadrangles
transform into each under sfano and tfano or, equivalently, under sdualfano and tdualfano. However, the ordering
of the four points within each quadrangle is not left invariant. For example, sdualfano : cdeb 7→edcg, which is
an odd permutation of the original ordering cdeg. This is the case whenever the quadrangle contains g due
to the fact that the permutation sdualfano is deﬁned by the quadrangle, abce, excluding George. Similarly, for

Table 41: The seven quadrangles, identiﬁed with points as described here, form an equivalent representation of the Fano plane
using the composition rule (D.7).
tdualfano the points of each quadrangle containing c receive an odd permutation since tdualfano is associated
with the quadrangle, defa, excluding Charlie.
In deﬁning a 56-dimensional action leaving I4 invariant one must account not only for the (dual) Fano
plane permutations but also the ordering of the points on each line and quadrangle. This is achieved by a
composite transformation, ﬁrst performing the (dual) Fano plane permutations as in (D.6), then reordering
the points on each line to their standard form. Finally, to account for the quadrangles, we must bit ﬂip each
qubit not appearing on the line given by the quadrangle associated with the dual Fano plane permutation.
For example, the permutation sdualfano is deﬁned by the quadrangle, abce, excluding George and, hence, we
bit ﬂip the qubits B, D, E, and F, that is those qubits not lying on the line gGAC. Similarly, for tdualfano
the relevant quadrangle is given by excluding Charlie and so we bit ﬂip the qubits A, B, E, and G, i.e. those
not included in the line cCDF .
As an explicit example let us consider the action of s56 on a1A0B1D. Note, we have labelled the indices
to keep track of orderings. The composite transformation is given by,
s56 : a1A0B1D
relabel
7−−−−→b1C0B1E
permute
7−−−−−→b0B1C1E
bit ﬂipBE
7−−−−−−→b1B1C0E,
(D.8)
where the relabelling is done according to the sfano and sdualfano permutations. We bit ﬂip B and E (but
not C) as they do not appear in the line GAC. Therefore the complete transformation, for this example, is
a101 7→b110. All in all this yields a 56 dimensional real representation of PSL(2, F7), see Figure 15.
D.3. Decomposition of the 56-dimensional representation
PSL(2, F7) has six classes and therefore six irreps, as summarised in Table 40 [241]. Note, the ﬁnal row
corresponds to the compound characters of the 56 described here. This 56 dimensional representation is
clearly reducible and, to determine how it decomposes, we may use,
aµ = 1
g
X
α
gαχ[µ]∗
α
χ[56]
α
,
(D.9)
where aµ counts the number of times irrep µ appears in the 56. Note, g and gα are the dimension of the
group and conjugacy class, Cα, respectively. Using Table 40 one ﬁnds,
aµ = {2, 0, 0, 4, 2, 2},
(D.10)
and, hence, we have
56 = 1 + 1 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 7 + 7 + 8 + 8.
(D.11)
This is consistent with the breaking of the fundamental 56 of E7 under PSL(2, F7), which goes as,
56 →1 + 1 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 7 + 7 + 8 + 8.
(D.12)
In [16] the PSL(2, F7) symmetry of the N = 8 black hole entropy has been related, via a special set
of 63 three-qubit operators, to the generalised hexagon of order two using the dictionary constructed in
section 10.2.1. They further suggested that the full G2(2) symmetry of the hexagon may be preserved by
the black hole entropy.

Figure 15: Graphical representation of the generators of the 56 dimensional representation of PSL(2, F7). These are the 56×56
matrices s56 (left) and t56 (right). The gridlines partition the matrices into 8 × 8 blocks that transform a single letter, while
the ﬁlled squares correspond to the non-zero unit entries. Clearly each letter octet is transformed into another, without mixing
between octets. One can read oﬀ, for example, that s56 converts a’s to b’s and vice versa, while t56 transforms the a’s amongst
themselves.
