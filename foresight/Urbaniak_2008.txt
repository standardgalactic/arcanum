Abstract 
Stanis law Le´sniewski (1886–1939) developed his system of foundations of mathematics 
as an alternative to the system of Principia Mathematica. He constructed three systems: 
Protothetic, which is his version of a generalized propositional calculus, his own logic of 
predication called Ontology, and a theory of parthood called Mereology. 
The ﬁrst part (chapters 1–5) is historical. Chapter 1 contains a brief biography of 
Le´sniewski and a short guide to primary sources. Chapter 2 is devoted to a detailed 
discussion of Le´sniewski’s views on the philosophical problems he wrote about. These 
include existential propositions, principles of contradiction and excluded middle, the eter­
nity of truth, existence of universals, and certain paradoxes (most importantly, Russell’s 
paradox). Chapters 3–5 are concerned with a fairly detailed presentation of Le´sniewski’s 
systems in a modern framework. Each of them is provided with a guide to secondary 
literature. 
The second part (chapters 6 and 7) is more theoretical. In chapter 6 Le´sniewski’s 
and Soboci´nski’s (Soboci´nski 1949b) solution of Russell’s paradox is studied and argued 
to be unsuccessful. Next, a strengthening of Mereology (S lupecki 1958) that was meant 
to improve the situation is discussed and diﬃculties that it copes with are indicated. In 
chapter 7 a modal factor to provide a nominalist semantics for a language very similar 
to that of Elementary Ontology is introduced. The idea here is that higher-order quan­
tiﬁcation ranges over ‘ways names could be’. A Kripkean semantics is provided which is 
intended to capture that notion and prove that the system thus obtained is equivalent to 
its standard set-theoretic version. Certain philosophical issues surrounding this approach 
are discussed.

Introduction 
The Lvov-Warsaw school of logic and analytic philosophy was one of the most important 
schools of philosophical thought in twentieth century. In early 1910s its members already 
discussed the validity of the principles of excluded middle and contradiction. Among ideas 
developed in this school one might count  Lukasiewicz’s view that contradictions may be 
believed to be true and that certain sentences can be neither true nor false which led to 
the construction of his three-valued logic, Ajdukiewicz’s conventionalism about meaning 
and his formal work on deﬁnitions (it seems that it was Ajdukiewicz who ﬁrst put forward 
the consistency, translatability and non-creativity conditions on deﬁnitions), Ja´skowski’s 
approach to natural deduction and his work on discussive logics, Lindenbaum’s lemma 
on maximally consistent sets of formulas, Presburger’s work on arithmetic, Kotarbi´nski 
semantical reism, and Tarski’s work on formal semantics and truth, just to give a few 
examples. 
One of the representatives of this school was Stanis law Le´sniewski (1886–1939) (Alfred 
Tarski, whose importance in twentieth century logic it is hard to overestimate, was his 
only PhD student). Le´sniewski developed his system of foundations of mathematics as 
an alternative to the system of Principia Mathematica. He constructed three systems: 
Protothetic, which is his version of a generalized propositional calculus, his own logic of 
predication called Ontology, and a theory of parthood called Mereology. 
Le´sniewski’s work is interesting for a few reasons. 
• If one is interested in history of logic in general, it is hard to deny that Le´sniewski 
was one of the key ﬁgures in one of the most important schools of logic in twentieth 
century, who also seriously tried to develop an alternative to the system of Principia 
Mathematica, and hence he is worth studying in his own right.

• If one is interested in the development of Tarski’s thought it might be useful to learn 
what his PhD supervisor’s views were and how Le´sniewski’s work and Tarski’s ideas 
are (or are not) related. 
• Philosophical discussions in which Le´sniewski participated pertained to issues which 
are discussed quite lively even today: his approach to semantical and set-theoretic 
paradoxes and his views on the validity of the principle of excluded middle and of 
the principle of contradiction are quite interesting philosophically. 
• Le´sniewski was a nominalist and his systems were a nominalistic attempt to provide 
a system of foundations of mathematics. It is a major attempt of this sort and as 
such is worth an examination. 
• His metalogic is also quite speciﬁc. Nominalist as he was, he wanted to develop a 
purely inscriptional syntactic description of his systems in a way that did not make 
any reference to expression types. It is interesting to see how he proceeded and 
whether this approach works. 
• His logical systems are also interesting in their own right. In all of them deﬁnitions 
can be creative (and this is not considered to be a problem). He also was one of the 
ﬁrst logicians to use natural deduction in his proofs. The generality of Prothetic 
admits interesting extensions (intuitionistic (see L´opez-Escobar and Miraglia 2002) 
or modal (see the works of Suszko), for instance).1 The language of Ontology 
(which, in a way, can be viewed as the ﬁrst free logic in history) is, arguably, more 
suitable for capturing certain aspects of predication and abstract noun phrases as 
they work in natural language.

This work is devoted to a presentation of Le´sniewski’s achievements and their critical 
evaluation. I discuss his philosophical views, describe his systems and evaluate the role 
they can play in the foundations of mathematics. I then show the weaknesses of this 
approach and then focus on the question of the ontological commitment of Le´sniewski 
quantiﬁcation, which has to be answered by the nominalist ﬁrst, before he embarks on 
the enterprize of reconstructing mathematics within Le´sniewski’s framework. 
This dissertation is divided in two parts: part I: historical aspects, and part II: re­
evaluation. The ﬁrst part (chapters 1–5) is historical. In chapter 1 I present a brief 
description of Le´sniewski’s life and philosophical development (section 1.1) and provide 
a guide to primary sources (section 1.2). 
In chapter 2 I discuss Le´sniewski’s philosophical views from the period 1911–1916. 
I start with an account of Le´sniewski’s understanding of linguistic conventions (section 
2.2). In modern terms, Le´sniewski’s linguistic conventions may be thought of as various 
restrictions put on natural language. Those include e.g. deﬁnitions, which are intended to 
determine how he uses some terms, some general conditions on what truth conditions of 
various statements are, and some other assumptions about the language of the discourse 
which are hard to classify. I also provide some basic conventions that he accepted and 
used in the years 1911–1914. Next, I show how he applied those conventions to various 
problems. That is, I discuss what conclusions those conventions helped him to draw 
about existential propositions (section 2.3), the principle of contradiction (section 2.4), 
the principle of excluded middle (section 2.5), the eternity of truth (section 2.6), and 
how he attempted to solve a few paradoxes: Nelson–Grelling’s, Meinong’s, Epimenides’ 
2See section 5.4 for references.

(the Liar), and Russell’s (section 2.7). Finally I say a few words about his rejection of 
abstract objects (section 2.8). 
Chapter 3 is devoted to Le´sniewski’s generalized system of propositional calculus 
(called Protothetic). In section 3.1 I describe the historical context in which it was con­
structed. In section 3.2 I discuss the notion of semantic category which is crucial for 
the construction of Le´sniewski’s systems. Section 3.3 deals with Le´sniewski’s original 
“wheel-and-spoke” notation. Section 3.4 describes Le´sniewski’s motivations for his for­
mulation of Protothetic (especially his criticism of Principia Mathematica). Protothetic 
originated as the result of gradual axiomatic generalization of the propositional calculus. 
The ﬁrst propositional system (S) given by Le´sniewski is a purely equivalential proposi­
tional calculus without quantiﬁers. The second system (S1) admitted quantiﬁers binding 
propositional quantiﬁers and also variables representing propositional connectives. Ex­
tending S1 with a certain rule (rule η) results in a stronger system S2. However, η was 
quite complicated, so it was replaced by another, simpler rule (called the rule of exten­
sionality, η?). The result of this replacement is called S3. A conditional reformulation of 
S3 was called S4 and a slight modiﬁcation of S3 in which deﬁnitions were of a diﬀerent 
form was called S5. All those axiomatizations are presented in section 3.5. Section 3.6 
is an annotated guide to the secondary literature of the subject. 
Chapter 4 is concerned with Le´sniewski’s Ontology. Section 4.1 introduces the basic 
intuitions behind the system and indicates in what respects the system diﬀers from the 
classical logic. In section 4.2 the language of Ontology is described in more detail, and 
section 4.3 presents the 1920 axiomatization of Ontology. Some examples of deﬁnitions 
of Ontology that highlight the ﬂexibility of the language in question are given in section 
4.4. A good example of a reasoning led in Ontology is Le´sniewski’s argument against uni­
versals. A certain formulation of this argument is discussed in section 4.5. At this point 
a question arises to what extent my style of presentation diﬀers from that of Le´sniewski. 

5 
Le´sniewski’s original style of presentation is described in section 4.6, where I also present 
and discuss the basic ideas of his inscriptional metalogic and give a few examples of his 
terminological explanations. Secondary literature pertaining to Ontology is discussed in 
section 4.7. 
Le´sniewski’s Mereology is discussed in chapter 5. In section 5.1 I focus on Le´sniewski’s 
motivations for mereology. Section 5.2 describes and compares the axiomatizations of 
Mereology from years 1916, 1918, 1920 and 1921. Section 5.3 introduces those theorems 
of Mereology which initially were intended to support the claim that Mereology can be a 
sensible replacement for set theory and also those theorems which indicate to what extent 
Mereology turns out to be diﬀerent from the standard set theory. In the same section I 
also critically assess the potential role of Mereology in the foundations of mathematics. 
Section 5.4 is a survey of secondary literature related to Mereology. This chapter ends 
the historical part of my research. 
There, of course, exist surveys of Le´sniewski’s work. However, to the best of my 
knowledge, their scope and interests diﬀer from mine. Most of the discussions present in 
the literature focus just on selected aspects of Le´sniewski’s work. For instance, S lupecki 
(1953, 1955), Iwanu´s (1973), Rickey (1976) and Lejewski (1958) are meant to focus on 
one of the logical systems only. Luschei (1962), Betti (2005) cover not only the content of 
what Le´sniewski actually published, but also almost indistinguishably speak of what he 
is known (from other sources) by the authors to have said or believed. Wole´nski (1985), 
Rickey (1976) and Betti (2005) are too brief to provide a complete introduction. When the 
above authors discuss Le´sniewski’s views, they focus on presenting them almost without 
any criticism, whereas works that criticize Le´sniewski (such as Grzegorczyk 1955) have 
been justly accused of misrepresenting the systems. Hence, my intention is to provide 
a survey that covers all aspects of what Le´sniewski published, makes a clear distinction 
between what views can be assigned to him based on textual evidence and what he is 

6 
reported or believed to have claimed, and, when his philosophical views are discussed, 
assesses them critically. 
Probably the only published book-long treatment of similar scope is Luschei’s book, 
titled The Logical Systems of Le´sniewski (1962). Unfortunately, it has been criticized on 
a number of issues. 
First, the text has been found to be unnecessarily polemical (Cohen 1965). It also does 
not contain a detailed account of how the proofs work (Thomas 1967) nor precisely stated 
results (Kearns 1973) and the author gets involved in a philosophical commentary about 
the system and historical remarks rather than presenting Le´sniewski’s views critically 
(Dawson 1965). I do not want to suggest that I managed to avoid any criticism of the 
above sort. Rather, I would be glad if it turned out that at least to some degree my work 
constitutes even a slight improvement on these points. 
The second, more theoretical part starts with chapter 6 where I describe and critically 
assess Le´sniewski’s and Soboci´nski’s (Soboci´nski 1949b) solution of Russell’s paradox. 
The main point of this chapter is that as far as Mereology is employed in the alleged 
solution, this is not a real solution to the problem (it just consists of replacing a problem­
atic theory with a wholly new and quite diﬀerent theory), and that as far as Mereology 
is not employed in the strategy there still exists a paradox not noticed by Soboci´nski 
(the solution implies that for any two individuals one is an element of the other) (sec­
tions 6.1–6.5 are devoted to these issues). Another strategy of dealing with set-theoretic 
paradoxes, which employs the so-called higher-order epsilon connectives, suggested by 
Lejewski (1985), is discussed in section 6.6 where I describe the strategy, apply it to the 
problems raised by Le´sniewski and Soboci´nski and show that it falls short of providing 
with a theory strong enough to compete with set theory. Yet another attempt of turning 
Mereology into a useful tool in foundations of mathematics, S lupecki’s (1958) generalized 
mereology, is presented and assessed in section 6.7. This attempt, however, fails, not only 

7 
because at certain points it goes against Le´sniewski’s basic convictions about logic, but 
also because the resulting system is, in an important sense, not extensional. 
In the last chapter, in a sense, I take a step back. If the Le´sniewskian systems are to 
serve as a tool for the nominalist then even before we ask whether and what theories we 
can reconstruct within this framework we have to ﬁrst deal with the question whether 
the logical systems as they already are do not violate the nominalistic assumptions. 
Hence, I turn my attention to the question whether Le´sniewski’s quantiﬁers binding name 
variables (or Boolos’ plural quantiﬁers for that matter) commit one to the existence of 
sets (understood as abstract objects). First, I introduce the language of Quantiﬁed Name 
Logic (QNL) (section 7.2.1) and provide it with a set–theoretic semantics (section 7.2.2). 
Next, I compare QNL with Boolos’s logic of plurals and prove that the expressive power 
of both languages (modulo set–theoretic semantics) is the same (section 7.2.3). 
Having done that, I discuss the question whether plural quantiﬁcation commits its 
users to sets. I start with an argument to the eﬀect that it does (section 7.3). It ultimately 
rests on the assumption that the logic obtained with the substitutional semantics is devoid 
of certain theoretically preferable features that QNL with set–theoretic semantics has. 
This is the assumption that I challenge in section 7.4. In order to do that I develop a 
substitutional semantics which avoids the objections raised in section 7.3. First, I discuss 
two earlier attempts of providing plural quantiﬁcation with ontologically innocent seman­
tics. In section 7.4.1 I present combinatorial semantics (introduced by Peter Simons) and 
indicate its weak points. In section 7.4.2 Rickey’s natural models are deﬁned. Unfortu­
nately it is quite probable that Rickey’s semantics does not avoid the objections against 
a substitutional reading of quantiﬁers raised before. 
In section 7.4.3 I develop a Kripke semantics for quantiﬁed name logic (some of basic 
ideas stem from the considerations of Simons and Rickey). It is a modal interpretation, 
where the plural quantiﬁer ‘∃aφ’ (suppose φ does not contain free variables other than a) 

8 
is intuitively read as ‘it is possible to introduce a name a which would make φ substitu­
tionally true.’ There is a proof that QNL with Kripke semantics has the same expressive 
power as QNL with set–theoretic semantics (as it turns out, for any set–theoretic model 
there is a Kripke model which agrees with it on all QNL formulas and the other way 
round: for any Kripke model there is a set–theoretic model which agrees with it on all 
formulas). 
Next, in section 7.4.4 I explore the modal factor involved in this semantics by develop­
ing a two–sorted ﬁrst–order modal logic of naming (MLN). I show that QNL with Kripke 
semantics can be embedded in the language of MLN. Since this embedding preserves 
models (i.e. models for QNL and MLN are the same, what changes is just the inter­
pretation of symbols), it seems that the ontological commitment of QNL with Kripke 
semantics does not go beyond the ontological commitment of ﬁrst–order (two–sorted) 
modal logic (with one relation constant). Since it is much less plausible that ﬁrst–order 
modal logic commits one to abstract objects than that plural quantiﬁcation does, this 
strengthen my case for the ontological innocence of QNL. 
The last section of this chapter (7.4.5) contains philosophical comments regarding 
the content of previous sections. I brieﬂy compare my approach to Chihara’s theory 
of constructibility quantiﬁers, discuss the issues pertaining to ontological commitment, 
show how this approach avoids the usual objections against substitutional interpretation 
of plural quantiﬁers, and defend the view that there is nothing philosophically suspicious 
about restricting admissible models to complete naming structures (a notion to be deﬁned 
in section 7.4.3).

Stanis law Le´sniewski: life and work 
1.1 Life and philosophical development 
Stanis law Le´sniewski was born on March 30th, 1886 in Serpukhov, Russia. From 1899 to 
1903 he attended gymnasium in Irkutsk. Next, he spent some time traveling and study­
ing: 1904–106 — in Leipzig, where he met Wilhelm Wundt, ca. 1906–1908 in Heidelberg 
and Zurich, and in 1909 at the Ludwig Maximilian University in Munich. In 1910 he 
moved to Lvov, where within two years he completed his PhD dissertation under Kaz­
imerz Twardowski’s supervision. He spent some time in Warsaw in 1913 and then lived in 
Kimorciszki and Moscow for some time before ﬁnally settling in Warsaw, where in 1918 
he obtained his habilitation and was appointed the Chair of Philosophy of Mathematics 
at the University of Warsaw. There he supervised his only PhD student, Alfred Tarski, 
who graduated in 1923 (Tarski 1923). He continued teaching at the University of Warsaw 
till May 13th, 1939, when he died of thyroid cancer.1 
Le´sniewski’s ﬁrst publication was his PhD dissertation (1911). Between 1911 and 
1916 he published quite regularly. The majority of the papers from this period were 
rather informal, but the problems discussed belonged to the philosophy of logic and 
mathematics. Quite soon he was drawn to the problems raised by Russell’s paradox and 
the like. In 1914 he published his ﬁrst discussion of Russell’s paradox (where, it seems, 
he already employed some mereological intuitions) and his 1916 paper contains the ﬁrst 
attempt of formalization of his Mereology. Years 1911–1916 are sometimes referred to as 
the ﬁrst period of his philosophical activity.

(1985) or Luschei (1962).

11 
He did not publish anything between 1916 and 1927 — although after he moved to 
Warsaw he taught actively and obtained various results whose publication he withheld. 
During this period, sometimes dubbed ‘the second period of his philosophical develop­
ment’ he developed the bulk of his systems: Protothetic, Ontology and Mereology. 
Eventually, he resumed publication. The main enterprize was his “On the Founda­
tions of Mathematics” series, which consisted of eleven chapters spread over ﬁve volumes 
of the Polish Philosophical Journal (Przegl¸ad Filozoﬁczny). He also published two pa­
pers in Fundamenta Mathematicae concerned with speciﬁcally mathematical problems 
(axiomatic theories of groups and Abelian groups), and four separate papers where he 
elaborated on his logical systems (Protothetic and Ontology).2

May 13: dies in Warsaw 
As far as we know, 
from the beginning of his philosophical activity 
Le´sniewski was concerned with philosophy of logic. While in Lvov, he published his 
ﬁrst paper (which he defended as his dissertation), in which he discussed truth- and 
2Mereology, as a theory of parthood is usually considered an extra-logical theory. 

12 
analyticity- conditions of existential propositions (Le´sniewski 1911). Already there he 
accepted a somewhat Aristotelian view of the structure of predication. He treated ‘is’ as 
a copula which expresses predication and which occurs between two terms, as opposed to 
anything similar to the rendering typical for predicate logic, where one of the terms to­
gether with a copula are treated as predicate and the ﬁrst term has to be singular. Also, 
from the beginning he decided not to make a distinction between empty, singular and 
universal terms (referring to, respectively, no, exactly one, and more than one objects).3 
For instance, ‘Socrates is human’, rendered in predicate logic as ‘Human(socrates)’ where 
the argument has to be a singular term, would be according to Le´sniewski rendered as 
‘Socrates ε human’, where both ‘Socrates’ and ‘human’ can be singular, general or even 
empty terms, so that also sentences like ‘unicorn ε animal’ or ‘dog ε animal’ would 
be well–formed, if the language admitted natural language terms.4 Those two speciﬁc 
features of his approach will later become trademarks of his logical system of predication 
called Ontology. 
He was also concerned with the validity of the traditional logical principles. At the 
time there was quite a lively discussion of this in Poland. In 1910 Jan  Lukasiewicz 
(who later invented many-valued logics) wrote a book that attempted to undermine 
the Principle of Contradiction ( Lukasiewicz 1910a). Soon after Le´sniewski published 
a paper (1912) where he criticized  Lukasiewicz’s views. Also, the principle of Excluded 
Middle raised certain concerns.  
nski
Lukasiewicz (1910b) wrote on it and Tadeusz Kotarbi´
criticized the principle from indeterministic positions, arguing that statements about 
the future which are not yet determined are neither true nor false (Kotarbi´nski 1913). 
3If one wants to construct a logic to formalize statements of natural language, the intuition behind 
this decision may be something like this: logic is supposed to provide us with theses and deductions 
which stay valid when we apply them to natural language. When we use terms in natural language, we 
quite often do not know (or may be mistaken) as to whether they refer to a unique object or anything at 
all. But the validity (or syntactic correctness) of our rendering should not depend on quite often purely 
empirical matters like whether a term is empty or names a unique object. 
4This does not mean that they all would be true, but I will discuss satisfaction conditions of formulas 
constructed using ε later. 

13 
Le´sniewski (1913a,b) disagreed, arguing that the only case of failure of this principle is 
when it is interpreted in a very speciﬁc way and when some of the occurring terms are 
empty. 
Quite soon he became interested in paradoxes and the foundations of mathematics. 
Le´sniewski (1914a) argued that the Russell class does not exist, tacitly making some 
assumptions that hold for mereological fusions, but not for the sets in the classical set 
theory. In (1916), he provided the ﬁrst construction of his Mereology — an axiomatized 
theory of the parthood relation, which, as he later suggested, was supposed to constitute 
an alternative to set theory in the foundations of mathematics. 
One of the main themes in Le´sniewski’s development is increasing sympathy for nomi­
nalism. He came to regard his early argument against universals (to be found in (1913b)), 
which employed the notion of property, insuﬃcient and provided a formulation which did 
not seem to him to refer to properties (whose existence he came to deny). Between 1916 
and 1927, when he was constructing his systems and did not publish anything, one of 
his main concerns was to provide a nominalistic description of those calculi. So, instead 
of providing an inductive deﬁnition of an inﬁnite set of well-formed-formulas, he treated 
formulas as inscriptions and instead of speaking of the inﬁnite set of theorems of a system 
he spoke of a state of a system at a given moment, meaning the set of all inscriptions 
which were actually proven (i.e. such that there was a sequence of inscriptions which 
was a proof of that theorem). This feature, of course, made the whole construction very 
cumbersome — especially since another of his points of ﬁxation was the precision of ex­
pression. He tried to provide a description of the systems in a language as formalized 
as possible, where the notion of equiformity played an important part5 (this formalized 
5Instead of speaking of an expression type, say φ, he explicitly spoke of all tokens equiform to a token 
φ, where φ was described in terms of its structure and equiformity of its constituents to certain other 
tokens. For example, instead of ‘p ∧¬p is not provable in Protothetic’, he would say something like ‘for 
every token whose ﬁrst constituent is equiform to the following symbol: p, whose second constituent is 
equiform to the following symbol: ∧, and whose third constituent is equiform to the following symbol: 
¬p, in no system of Protothetic (i.e. in no inscribed development state of this system), this token is a 

14 
version is known as his ‘terminological explanations’).6 
His nominalistic inclinations also seem to have inspired him to put forward Mereology 
as an alternative to set theory. His main objection against set-theories which treated sets 
as abstract objects was that he could not even understand what is meant by a set as an 
abstract object and that the only way that he can understand this notion is when sets 
are identiﬁed with mereological wholes. 
He resumed publishing in 1927. From then on, his published works were mainly 
concerned with presentation of his logical systems and Mereology. He repudiated his 
early informal philosophical deliberations7 and focused on formal systems, continuing to 
work on them till his death. 
theorem of that system. 
6For the sake of simplicity this method of developing axiomatized systems will not be used in the 
dissertation. However, it is interesting for its own sake, and I touch this issue in section 4.6. 
7In (Le´sniewski 1927: 181) he wrote: “Steeped in the inﬂuence of John Stuart Mill in which I mainly 
grew up, and ‘conditioned’ by the problems of ‘universal–grammar’ and of logic-semantics in the style 
of Edward Husserl and by the exponents of the so–called Austrian School, I ineﬀectually attacked the 
foundations of ‘logistic’ from this point of view.”

1.2 Primary sources 
Below is the list of Le´sniewski’s papers together with English titles and reference to their 
original place of publication. All page references in this work refer to the two volumes 
of the English edition of Le´sniewski’s collected works (Le´sniewski 1991), even if some 
translations are slightly corrected.8 First, there are papers from the period 1911–1916: 
1. “Przyczynek do analizy zda´n egzystencjalnych” (A contribution to the analysis of existential 
propositions), (1911). 
2. “Pr´oba dowodu ontologicznej zasady sprzeczno´sci” (An attempt at a proof of the ontological 
principle of contradiction), (1912). 
3. “Czy prawda jest tylko wieczna czy te˙z i wieczna i odwieczna?” (Is all truth only true eternally 
or is it also true without a beginning?), (1913a). 
4. “Krytyka logicznej zasady wy l¸aczonego ´srodku” (The critique of the logical principle of the ex­
cluded middle), (1913b). 
5. “Czy klasa klas, niepodporz¸adkowanych sobie, jest podporz¸adkowana sobie?” (Is the class of 
classes not subordinated to themselves subordinated to itself?), (1914a). 
6. “Teoria mnogo´sci na ‘podstawach ﬁlozoﬁcznych’ Benedykta Bornsteina” (A theory of sets based 
on B. Bornstein’s ‘philosophical foundations’), (1914b). 
7. “Podstawy og´olnej teoryi mnogo´sci I” (Foundations of the general theory of sets I), (1916). 
The (1916) paper was the last one written in the early period, and also the ﬁrst that 
dealt with the issues discussed in details in the series of papers between 1927 and 1931, 
titled “On the Foundations of Mathematics I–XI”. The list of parts of this series together 
with their references is:

propositions of the type ‘Aεb’), (1931a). 
While working on this series, Le´sniewski also published two papers which were more 
concerned with speciﬁc mathematical topics rather than with foundations of mathemat­
¨ 
ics: “Uber Funktionen, deren Felder Abelsche Gruppen in bezug auf diese Funktionen 
sind” (On functions whose ﬁelds with respect to these functions are Abelian groups) 
¨ 
(1929c) and “ Uber Funktionen, deren Felder Gruppen mit R¨ucksicht auf diese Funktio­
nen sind” (On functions whose ﬁelds, w.r.t. these functions are groups) (1929d) simplify 

17 
axiomatizations of two mathematical theories (Abelian group theory and group theory 
respectively). 
In 1929, Le´sniewski also published a paper concerned with a description of Proto­
thetic: “Grundz¨uge eines neuen Systems der Grundlagen der Mathematic § 1–11” (Fun­
damentals of a new system of the foundations of mathematics, §1–§11” (1929a). 
¨ 
In “ Uber die Grundlagen der Ontologie” (On the Foundations of Ontology) (1930b) 
¨ 
he presented an outline of his Ontology and in “Uber Deﬁnitionen in der sogenannten 
Theorie der Deduction” (On deﬁnitions in the so-called theory of deduction) (1931b) he 
formalized the requirements he put on deﬁnitions in his systems. 
In 1938 he was preparing for publication in Collectanea Logica9 two papers: 
“Grundz¨uge eines neuen Systems der Grundlagen der Mathematik, §12” (Introductory 
remarks to the continuation of my article: fundamentals of a new system of the foun­
dations of mathematics) (1938a), where he elaborates on how he had formulated Proto­
thetic and explains some of its basic principles, and “Grundz¨uge eines neuen Systems der 
Grundlagen der Mathematik, §12” (Fundamentals of a new system of the foundations 
of mathematics §12) (1938b) where he hints at another, so-called computative formula­
tion of Protothetic. Those were never published, but the preprints copies survive in the 
Harvard College Library. 
Another invaluable source is a set of notes made by Le´sniewski’s students. The 
majority of the text consists of formal symbols, theorems and proofs. The notes have 
been gathered, translated into English and edited by Srzednicki and Stachniak (1988). 
There are two parts to that book: (a) foundations of mathematics, (b) Peano arithmetic 
and Whitehead’s theory of events. The ﬁrst part is divided into: “From the Foundations 
of Protothetic”, “Deﬁnitions and theses of Le´sniewski’s Ontology”, “Class Theory”. The 
second part consists of: “Primitive terms of arithmetic”, “Inductive Deﬁnitions”, and 
9A Polish journal which never came to being, mainly because of the second world war.

Chapter 2 
Le´sniewski’s early philosophical views 
2.1 Introduction 
It was not until the late 1920s that Le´sniewski started publishing on the systems of 
logic for which he is famous. Before 1920, he devoted his papers to certain issues in the 
philosophy of logic and mathematics. However, the majority of his investigations from 
that time is not a result of application of any formalized or axiomatized system; they 
are conducted informally. Among the problems he discussed are: logical properties of 
existential propositions, the justiﬁcation of the Principle of Contradiction, the value of 
the Principle of Excluded Middle, the eternity of truth, and some paradoxes: Meinong’s, 
Nelson-Grelling’s, Epimenides’ and, mostly important, Russell’s. 
Le´sniewski 
in 
1927 
apparently 
repudiated 
his 
earlier 
results 
(1927: 181–182). Nevertheless, some of his arguments are interesting. Even if sometimes 
they are not philosophically compelling, they do cast some light on how his thought de­
veloped. Moreover, the reader has the right to assess these early views on his own instead 
of trusting Le´sniewski’s self–criticism. 
I will begin with a discussion of Le´sniewski’s linguistic conventionalism and I list basic 
conventions that he accepted in the years 1911–1914. Next, I will show how he applied 
those conventions to various problems. That is, I will discuss what conclusions those 
conventions helped him to draw about (i) existential propositions, (ii) the principle of 
contradiction, (iii) the principle of excluded middle, (iv) the eternity of truth, and how 
he attempted to solve a few paradoxes: Nelson–Grelling’s, Meinong’s, Epimenides’ (the 
Liar), and Russell’s. Finally I will say a few words about his rejection of abstract objects.

2.2 Linguistic conventions 
In modern terms, Le´sniewski’s linguistic conventions may be thought of as various re­
strictions put on natural language. Those include e.g. deﬁnitions, which are intended to 
determine how he uses some terms, some general conditions on what the truth conditions 
of various types of statements are, and some other assumptions about the language of 
the discourse which are hard to classify.1 
Le´sniewski claimed that while “keeping to ‘natural intuitions’ of language we get in­
volved in irresolvable paradoxes” (1913b: 82), that is, if we rely only on common sense, 
it is hard to see any way out of paradoxes that arise in natural language.2 Although he 
did not use the term ‘compositional’, it seems that one of his main worries about natural 
language was that in natural language the symbolic function (which is Le´sniewski’s id­
iosyncratic term for something like ‘reference’ or ‘semantic role’) of a complex expression 
is not a straightforward result of the symbolic function of its components. In order to 
(i) avoid paradoxes that we run into when reasoning in natural language and (ii) explain 
how the symbolic function of a complex expression results from the symbolic functions of 
its constituents (and the way they are related to each other in this complex expression) 
1For instance, the Tarskian hierarchization of natural language seems to be a regimentation of the 
same sort. 
2Commenting on his solution to the Liar (where he employed the assumption than no noun phrase 
token refers to any expression token of which it is a part) he explained: 
It is also correct to say that the above–mentioned convention is ‘arbitrary’ in the 
sense that it conﬂicts with ‘natural intuitions’ of language. 
Rights that these ‘intu­
itions’ have are undoubtedly contravened by the fact that certain connoting expres­
sions are not supposed to represent all objects which have the properties connoted 
by the given expressions. Such statements, I say, would be totally justiﬁed — they 
could not, however, depreciate the above solution. 
Since, keeping to ‘natural intu­
itions’ of language we get involved in irresolvable paradoxes, these ‘intuitions’ seem 
to imply contradiction. The ‘artiﬁcial’ frame of strict conventions is thus a far bet­
ter instrument of reason than the language dissolving in the opaque contours of ‘natu­
ral’ habits which often imply incurable contradictions — much as the ‘artiﬁcially’ reg­
ulated Panama Canal is a better waterway than the ‘natural’ rapids on the Dnieper. 
(1913b: 82) 

21 
Le´sniewski introduced some deﬁnitions and postulates which were supposed to regulate 
the language that he used. He called them linguistic conventions. 3 Here is how he 
explained the need for linguistic conventions: 
The symbolic function of complex linguistic constructions, e.g., propositions, 
depends on the symbolic functions of the elements of these constructions, 
that is individual words, and on their mutual relationship. In the unplanned 
process of development of language, the symbolic function of propositions 
can depend in some particular cases on identical symbolic functions and on 
identical relationship between speciﬁc words — in quite diﬀerent ways. The 
planned construction of complex linguistic forms cannot, for representing var­
ious contents in the system of theoretical propositions, be conﬁned within 
the possible results of the unplanned evolution of language. Such construc­
tion calls for the formation of certain general conventional-normative schemas 
to embody the dependence of the symbolic functions of propositions on the 
symbolic functions of their elements, and on the mutual relationship between 
these elements. To ascertain whether the given content has been represented 
adequately or inadequately in a proposition, one has to analyze individually 
how the speaker’s representational intentions relate to the above-mentioned 
schemas. These schemas should indicate in what way the symbolic function of 
a proposition should be conditioned [determined R.U.] by the symbolic func­
tions of the particular words and by their mutual relationship. (1911: 16–17) 
And also: 
I have more than once pointed out that a system of linguistic symbols, just 
3He was not clear as to whether those conventions were to pertain only to an artiﬁcial modiﬁcation 
of his idiosyncratic language, or if the results that he obtained thanks to them also apply to natural 
language as well. 

22 
as any other system of symbols, e.g., the system of railway signals, requires 
the existence of certain rules for constructing the symbols and keys for read­
ing them.4 I have repeatedly stressed that the functions of various complex 
linguistic structures, e.g., those of propositions, should depend, in a correctly 
constructed precise language, upon the functions or the order of particular 
words — on the basis of certain patterns determined by general normative 
conventions the knowledge of which permits the correct symbolization of an 
object in a given language or the decoding of a symbol for a given language. 
Taking into account the need so speciﬁed for a precise language, I established, 
in my previous papers, various linguistic conventions indicating on what rules 
the system of linguistic symbols is based and how to understand statements 
about some constructions which I used in analysis. (1913b: 56) 
So, one reason for introducing conventions was to avoid running into paradoxes. An­
other one was quite straightforward. The trust we usually have in natural language in­
tuition, though mainly suﬃcient for everyday communication, does not allow us to avoid 
ambiguities in more complicated cases and does not provide any method of resolving 
misunderstandings. 
In his early work, Le´sniewski did not codify those conventions in a manner typical 
for an axiomatic system. To a large extent, they are to be found here and there in his 
papers, sometimes introduced quite ad hoc in order to approach a speciﬁc problem. I will 
enumerate and discuss those conventions in this section, and in the later sections I will 
go on to show how Le´sniewski applied them. Gathered together, the main conventions, 
beginning with some conventions from (1912: 31–42), are as follows: 
(2.1) All expressions are divided into connoting and non-connoting. 
4Le´sniewski’s father was a railroad engineer. 

23 
(2.2) 
An expression is connoting iﬀ it can be deﬁned.5 
It seems that Le´sniewski quite closely followed Aristotle in his account of deﬁnitions.6 
So, it may be a good approximation to read ‘can be deﬁned’ as ‘can be deﬁned by means 
of a classical deﬁnition’. A classical deﬁnition has the form: ‘A is a B which is C’. 
Following Aristotle, A here is the deﬁned expression, B is called the genus proximum 
(the closest kind) and C is a diﬀerentia speciﬁca (speciﬁc diﬀerence). It also seems that 
C has to somehow determine B, in the sense that not every B should be C (otherwise, 
C fails to be a speciﬁc diﬀerence). Thus, for instance, ‘square circle’ is a connoting 
expression, for we can say ‘A square circle is a circle which is a square’, whereas ‘how are 
you’ is not a connoting expression, because for no B and C we can say: ‘How are you is 
a B which is C’. 
(2.3) 
All expressions divide into denoting and non-denoting. Denoting ex­
pressions are those which refer to (symbolize) something that exists, whereas 
non-denoting expressions are those that do not refer to any existing object. 
For example, the following expressions denote something: ‘man’, ‘green’, ‘ob­
ject’, ‘the fact that every man possesses the property of mortality’, ‘every 
man is mortal’. The relation of denoting is called a symbolic relation. An 
expression which denotes something is said to possess a symbolic function.7 
5“I divide all linguistic expressions into connoting and non-connoting; I adopt the expression ‘connot­
ing expression’ to denote expressions that can be deﬁned, and the expression ‘non-connoting expression’ 
to denote expressions that cannot be deﬁned. The expressions ‘man’, ‘green’, ‘square circle’, ‘centaur’ 
are examples of connoting expressions; the expressions ‘to a man’, ‘well’, ‘at’, ‘abracadabra’, ‘object’, 
‘every man is mortal’, etc. are examples of non-connoting expressions.” (1911: 31) 
6At least insofar as we speak of the form of a deﬁnition. Aristotle speaks also about τὸ πρῶτον 
γένος and αἱ συλλαμβανόμεναι διαφοραί, which notions are strictly connected with his metaphysics. Still, 
he says: οὐδεν γὰρ ἕτερόν ἐστιν ἐν τῷ ὁρισμῷ πλὴν τὸ πρῶτον λεγόμενον γένος καὶ μετὰ τούτου αἱ 
συλλαμβανόμεναι διαφοραί, “Because there is nothing else in the deﬁnition besides the primary genus and 
the diﬀerentiae.” (Met., Z, 1037b, 29–30) 
7“I divide all linguistic expressions into those denoting something and those denoting nothing, in 
other words symbolizing something and symbolizing nothing or expressions which are symbols and those 
which are not. I call the relation of expressions to the objects denoted (in other words — symbolized) 
by these expressions, a symbolic relation. I call that property of an expression which consists in its sym­
bolizing something, the symbolic function of that expression. An expression which denotes something, 

24 
(2.4) If an expression can be used and treated as having a symbolic function, 
it is said to have a symbolic disposition. 8 
(2.5) 
Connoting expressions having symbolic function divide into expres­
sions for which there is a non-connoting expression which symbolizes the same 
object, and expressions for which there is no such non-connoting expression. 
For instance, the expression ‘the fact that every man is mortal’ denotes the 
fact that every man is mortal. There is a corresponding non-connoting ex­
pression: ‘every man is mortal’, which denotes the same fact. By contrast, for 
the connoting expression ‘cow’ there is no non-connoting expression denoting 
the same object(s). 
(2.6) 
Accordingly, connoting expressions possessing a symbolic disposition 
divide into expressions for which there is a non-connoting expressions having 
the same symbolic disposition, and those for which there is no such connoting 
expression.9 
or which possesses the symbolic function, can be exempliﬁed by the following: ‘man’, ‘green’, ‘object’, 
‘the possessing by every man of the property of mortality’, ‘every man is mortal’, etc. The expressions 
which do not denote anything, or do not possess symbolic functions, can be exempliﬁed by the following 
ones: ‘abracadabra’, ‘square circle’, ‘centaur’, ‘the possessing by every man of the property of immor­
tality’, ‘every man is immortal’, etc. The expression ‘square circle’ does not possess a symbolic function 
because no object is a square circle, in other words there is no such object as could be symbolized by 
the expression ‘square circle’; thus the expression ‘square circle’ symbolizes no object, in other words 
symbolizes nothing. The expressions ‘possessing by every man of the property of immortality’, ‘every 
man is immortal’ do not possess a symbolic function because no man is immortal, in other words there 
is no object that could be symbolized by the aforementioned expressions. Therefore, these expressions 
symbolize no objects, or symbolize nothing.” (1911: 31–32) 
8“I call the property of an expression which consists in that expression’s application or treatment 
(according to, or against, the adopted linguistic conventions) as one possessing the symbolic function, the 
symbolic disposition of that expression. Thus, e.g., I say that the expressions: ‘man’, ‘hippocentaur’, 
‘every man is mortal’, ‘the possessing by a hippocentaur of the property of horseness’ — possess a 
symbolic disposition when they are applied, or treated as expression-symbols. The ﬁrst and third of 
these expressions possess a symbolic function, but the second and fourth do not because no object is a 
hippocentaur or the possession by a hippocentaur of the property of horsiness.”(1911: 33) 
9“All connoting expressions possessing a symbolic function can be divided into two groups: expres­
sions which correspond with any non-connoting expression symbolizing the same object, and expressions 
which correspond with no non-connoting expression symbolizing the same object. Thus, e.g., the con­
noting expression ‘the possessing by every man of the property of mortality’ corresponds with a non-
connoting expression symbolizing the same object, namely the expression ‘every man is mortal’. The 

25 
(2.7) 
Non-connoting expressions for which there is a connoting expression 
having the same symbolic disposition are called propositions. (1911: 34)10 
(2.8) 
A proposition is true iﬀ it possesses a symbolic function. Otherwise, 
it is false. (1911: 34–35) 
(2.9) 
A simple aﬃrmative proposition (i.e. a proposition not having a 
proposition as its proper part) symbolizes the relation of inherence between 
the object denoted by the subject and the properties connoted by the pred­
icate.11 Such a proposition has the form: ‘S is P ’ and is true if and only 
if the object denoted by the subject has all the properties connoted by the 
predicate.12 
(2.10) “A proposition having a denoting subject and a connoting predicate 
possesses a symbolic function if[f]13 a singular proposition being its contra-
latter also symbolizes the possessing by every man of the property of mortality and also the expression 
‘the possessing by every man of the property of mortality’. Whereas the connoting expression ‘man’ cor­
responds with no non-connoting expression which would symbolize the same objects as those symbolized 
by the word ‘man’. 
All connoting expressions possessing a symbolic disposition can be divided into two groups: expressions 
which correspond with any non-connoting expression possessing the same symbolic disposition, and 
expressions which correspond with no such non-connoting expression.”(1911: 34) 
10Whenever I refer to someone’s work, it is my reading of the text, unless quotation marks are present. 
11It seems that here by ‘the relation of inherence between an object and a property’ Le´sniewski does 
not mean one and the same relation for all true simple sentences, but rather something like “relation 
tokens”. For him, whenever we have two true atomic sentences such that either their subjects symbolize 
diﬀerent objects or the predicates symbolize diﬀerent properties, the relation of inherence between an 
object and a property symbolized by one of the sentences is diﬀerent from the relation of inherence 
between an object and a property symbolized by the other sentence. 
12“. . . any proposition possessing a symbolic function symbolizes the possessing by the object, sym­
bolized by the subject of that proposition, of properties connoted by its predicate. This convention 
implies that propositions can symbolize only the relations of inherence.”(1911: 36) What is somewhat 
interesting, Le´sniewski, instead of saying that this refers only to simple (atomic) propositions adds a 
footnote which says: “. . . I speak of propositions in the sense of the ones reduced to the form of cate­
gorical propositions with positive copulas and predicates in the Nominative.” (1911: 36) which seems 
to suggest the claim that all propositions are reducible to propositions of this speciﬁc form. This claim 
however is not essential for further discussion; neither does Le´sniewski give a complete set of directions 
describing how this reduction should proceed for any arbitrary proposition. Therefore, I decided to 
treat (2.9) as referring to simple propositions only, without assuming the claim about the reducibility of 
complex propositions (which seems quite implausible anyway). 
13Le´sniewski in his early writings used ‘if’ in deﬁnitions in the sense of ‘iﬀ’. 

26 
dictory counterpart does not possess the symbolic function.” (1911: 36) 
(2.11) 
“No contradictory proposition possesses a symbolic function.”14 
(1911: 36) 
(2.12) “If one of two propositions contradicting each other possesses a sym­
bolic function, then the other will not possess one.” (1911: 36) 
(2.13) 
A proposition is true a priori iﬀ its truth can be demonstrated by 
means of linguistic conventions alone. It is false a priori iﬀ its falsehood can 
be demonstrated by means of linguistic conventions alone.15 (1911: 36) 
Now, a few conventions to be found elsewhere: 
(2.14) 
“[A] connoting expression W represents any object possessing the 
properties connoted by the expression ‘W ’ — with the exception of the ex­
pression ‘W ’ itself together with those expressions which have at least one 
element in common with the expression ‘W ’.” (1913b: 64) 
Le´sniewski was a nominalist (I discuss his argument against universals later on). His 
convention about what connoting expressions denote is to be understood as pertaining 
to what nowadays we would rather call tokens: utterances and inscriptions. The above 
convention allowed him to explain away the Liar in its basic formulation. 
(2.15) A simple aﬃrmative proposition is analytic iﬀ it contains no predicates 
which connote properties that are not connoted by the subject. It is synthetic 
14Whenever a convention was originally phrased in a concise manner, I just quote it. If I ﬁnd it useful 
to provide a reformulation, I do so. 
15Probably ‘alone’ should be read as ‘as only extralogical assumptions.’ “I call false a priori all 
such propositions whose falseness can be demonstrated by means of linguistic conventions alone or the 
propositions which can be inferred from those conventions. . . . On the analogy of the deﬁnition of the 
expression ‘proposition false a priori’, I deﬁne the expression ‘proposition true a priori’. I employ the 
latter expression to denote such propositions whose validity can be demonstrated by means of linguistic 
conventions alone or the propositions which can be inferred from these conventions.” 

27 
if it contains predicates which connote (also) such a property (properties) that 
are not connoted by the subject. Here is how he phrased the distinction: 
I use the expression ‘analytic proposition’ to denote propositions 
which, being of the form of propositions with positive copulas, 
contain no predicates which connote properties that are not con­
noted by the subject. I use the expression ‘synthetic proposition’ 
to denote those propositions which, being of the form of proposi­
tions with positive copulas, contain predicates which connote also 
such properties that are not connoted by the subject. Thus, e.g., 
the propositions ‘man has two hands’, ‘an orphan does not have 
a mother’ are analytic if we use the word ‘man’ in the sense of 
‘mammal with two hands and two legs’, and the word ‘orphan’ in 
the sense of ‘human being that has neither father nor mother’; it is 
because the properties connoted by the predicates of the proposi­
tions with positive copulas — ‘man is what has two hands’ and ‘an 
orphan is what does not have a mother’ — that is the properties of 
having two hands and not having a mother — are connoted by the 
subjects: ‘man’ and ‘orphan’. The propositions: ‘man creates God 
in his own likeness’ or ‘an orphan never knows a caress in his life’, 
on the other hand, are synthetic because the properties connoted 
by the predicates of the propositions with positive copulas: ‘man is 
what creates God to his own likeness’ and ‘an orphan is what does 
not know a caress in its life’, that is the properties of creating God 
to one’s own likeness and of not knowing a caress in one’s life, are 
not connoted by the subjects. (1911: 2–3) 

28 
(2.16) 
A proposition with a negative copula (‘is not’) reduces to a propo­
sition with the same subject, positive copula and a predicate generated by 
preceding the predicate of the previous sentence by ‘non’, e.g. ‘S is not a P ’ 
reduces to ‘S is a non-P .’ 16 
Le´sniewski has also introduced a convention about proper names which, although not 
used afterwards, is interesting in itself: 
(2.17) 
Proper names connote the property of possessing a name which 
sounds like a given proper name. Proper names denote diﬀerent objects 
univocally. Proper names connote the property of possessing a name which 
sounds like a given proper name. Proper names denote diﬀerent objects 
univocally. For example ‘James’ denotes every James in the same sense (as 
far as there is more than one person called ‘James’). 
Since Le´sniewski’s views on proper names are quite uncommon let us take a closer look 
at what he says about them: 
J.S. Mill says that not all names have connotations. Among those which 
have no connotations are, according to Mill, proper names such as, e.g., Paul, 
Caesar on the one hand, and some of the names of attributes on the other. 
If this were really so, one could foresee certain diﬃculties in regarding as 
analytic those positive existential propositions whose subjects are just such 
names without connotation. Yet even the names which I have mentioned and 
16“. . . a proposition with a negative copula can symbolize possessing, by the object denoted by the 
subject of that proposition, properties connoted by the expression consisting of the word ‘not’ and the 
predicate of the proposition with a negative copula in question (the negation ‘not’ is to apply to the whole 
expression that follows it). If the proposition with a negative copula has the form: ‘no etc . . . ’, then the 
word ‘no’ will be substituted, in the process of reduction, by the word ‘every’. Thus the proposition with 
a negative copula ‘no object can both possess and not possess one and the same property’ . . . symbolizes 
the possessing by the object denoted by the subject of that sentences . . . the possessing by every object 
of properties connoted by the expression consisting of the word ‘not’ and the predicate of the proposition 
with a negative copula —that is, the expression ‘able to both possess and not possess one and the same 
property’.” (1912: 23) 

29 
which according to Mill have no connotation, in my opinion, have connotation; 
proper names connote the property of possessing a name which sounds like 
the given proper name, whereas the names of attributes regarded by Mill as 
lacking connotation, connote either the property of possessing such names, or 
the property of complete identity with entities which bear such names. Thus, 
e.g., the name ‘Paul’ connotes the property of having the name ‘Paul’, the 
name ‘redness’ connotes the property of having the name ‘redness’. Instead 
of ‘Paul’ we can then say ‘a being which has the name ‘Paul”, instead of 
‘redness’ — a being which is completely identical with beings that bear the 
name ‘redness’. . . I shall touch here upon Husserl’s thesis that one proper 
name, e.g., Socrates’, can name various objects only because it is ambiguous, 
just as names such as ‘redness’; I do not think this is the case — these names 
would be equivocal only if, while denoting various objects, they also connoted 
diﬀerent properties. In fact the word ‘Socrates’, while denoting diﬀerent 
objects, connotes always one property, that is the property of bearing the 
name ‘Socrates’. [translation slightly corrected R.U.](1911: 5–6) 
This view is not the same as a descriptive theory of proper names. The descriptive 
theory postulates that for any proper name there is a deﬁnite description which uniquely 
determines its reference. This already assumes that proper names, taken univocally, pick 
out their referents uniquely. On the other hand, Le´sniewski suggested that proper names 
are not only connotative (as Russell or Frege may be read to have suggested), but also 
that they are, in a sense, general terms. There are at least two claims about proper 
names that Le´sniewski seems to have been committed to, which seem quite controversial: 
(2.18) 
For any proper name n it is possible that there are at least two 
diﬀerent objects, o1 and o2 such that if terms n1 and n2 refer uniquely to o1 
and o2 respectively, then both ‘n1 is n’ and ‘n2 is n’ are true. 

30 
(2.19) 
For any object o, o is a referent of a proper name n iﬀ o has a 
property of being named by n. 
It might be objected against (2.18) that whenever we use a proper name, we seem 
to (or at least we are trying to) refer to a unique object. (2.19) seems, prima facie, 
unbelievable if we apply possible-world semantics. For indeed, take the name ‘Aristotle’. 
It seems that Aristotle could have been named with a diﬀerent proper name than the 
name which he actually was given. Thus, there appears to be a possible world where 
Aristotle does not possess the property of being named ‘Aristotle’.17 
I do not intend to defend Le´sniewski’s account of proper names. However, it is not 
obvious that the above objections are conclusive. Consider the objection against (2.18). 
First of all, from the fact that whenever we use a noun phrase m, we tend to refer to 
a unique object being its referent, it does not follow that it is not possible that m has 
more than one referent. This is pretty straightforward and does not require an additional 
argument. However, note that there are some terms which are general, but nevertheless 
in the majority of their uses are taken as referring to exactly one object (that is, what a 
term in one of its uses is taken to refer to does not settle what it refers to on the basis 
of its connotation only). For example ‘father of’ or ‘mother of’. Second, proper names 
in some rare uses are taken to refer to multiple objects. For instance, if a superstitious 
parapsychologist who believes in ‘the power of names’ says ‘Jacob is always impolite’ she 
does not have to refer to any speciﬁc person. Rather, she might be understood as saying 
‘Everyone whose name is ‘Jacob’ is impolite’. Or, she may say ‘Every Jacob is impolite’, 
which on the face of it seems to be a normal case of quantiﬁcation and, unless some other 
reasons against this reading are given, can be treated as such. Speciﬁcally, it is sometimes 
admissible (however uncommon) to use a plural form of a proper name to refer to a few 
bearers of this name simultaneously. One of those languages seems to be Polish. So, 
17See (Kripke 1980) regarding related issues. 

31 
for example, if there are two men, each of them being named ‘Rafal’, you might say (in 
Polish): ‘The Rafals went to the store’ if it is clear from the context that those two men 
are the only Rafals you might be referring to (apparently this also works for English, but 
since it is my second language I do not want to say anything authoritatively here). 
The objection against (2.19) does not seem to be really conclusive. What it indicates, 
though, is that (2.19) has not been precisely formulated. Although the example men­
tioned in the objection may falsify (2.19) in one of its readings, consider the following 
intuitive emendation: 
(2.20) 
For any object o, o is a referent of a proper name n (in a language 
L) iﬀ n has the property of being named by n (in L). 
where by ‘being named’ we speak of some sort of procedure typical for the way proper 
names are introduced in a given language. 
It is true that the being which in the actual world (in English) is named Aristotle in 
another possible world is not named Aristotle by any of the languages existing in that 
possible world. He still would be named Aristotle (in the actual English). So, even in 
that possible world has the property of being named ‘Aristotle’ in the actual English.18 
Now, Aristotle, even if the circumstances were diﬀerent in some other possible world 
where he would not have been called ‘Aristotle’ still would have been named by ‘Aristotle’ 
in the language as we use it. Of course, if in our own language ‘Aristotle’ did not refer 
to the person it actually refers to, it would not have been true in our language that he 
(when a unique reference to that person is being made) is Aristotle. But this situation 
would not constitute a counterexample against (2.19). 
What is interesting, this account of proper names (if we are to follow this explication) 
suggests that proper names are, modernly speaking, rigid designators if the following 
18In a sense, that indicates that the connotations of proper names on Le´sniewski’s view are not purely 
descriptive, for the reference to the actual language to which the proper name belongs is rigid.

condition is satisﬁed: 
(2.21) 
For any two languages L1, L2 if there is a proper name n such that 
1

in L1 it refers to all and only the object(s):

all and only the object(s): 
and either k = i or for some u o

then L1 = L2. 
For indeed, if Aristotle (the philosopher) in our language is named ‘Aristotle’ and any 
language in which ‘Aristotle’ does not refer to (our) Aristotle is not our language, then, 
insofar as we speak in our own language, it is not possible that Aristotle is such a person 
that it might not have been (called in our language) ‘Aristotle’. However, certainly, it is 
possible that there is a language in which Aristotle is not called ‘Aristotle’. 
2.3 Existential propositions 
The 
properties 
of 
existential 
propositions 
was 
the 
ﬁrst 
issue 
on 
which 
Le´sniewski published (1911) and to which he applied his conventions. In this paper 
Le´sniewski claimed that: (i) all positive and all negative existential propositions are false, 
whereas (ii) all positive are analytic (so, analyticity does not imply truth, according to 
Le´sniewski), (iii) some negative propositions (with contradictory subjects) are analytic, 
and (iv) some negative propositions are synthetic. 
Existential propositions are deﬁned as atomic propositions of a very speciﬁc form. A 
positive existential proposition is of the form: ‘S exists’. Or equivalently: ‘S is a being’ 
(1911: 3). A negative existential proposition has the form: ‘S does not exist’ or ‘S is not 
a being’ where ‘being’ is a noun meaning the same as Latin ens, Greek on, or English 
object. 
Now, following the convention regarding connoting expressions (2.1), we know that 
‘being’ connotes something only if it can be deﬁned by means of a classical deﬁnition. 

33 
However, to construct such a deﬁnition, we would have to ﬁnd such B and C that: 
(2.22) 
Being is a B which is C. 
would be a classical deﬁnition. To make such a deﬁnition work, B would have to be a 
name wider than ‘being’. However, (and that is another concept taken from Aristotelian 
thought) there is no name wider than ‘being’ or ‘object’, for everything that can be 
named is an object, and as such, a being of some sort.19 
Thus, there is no deﬁnition of ‘being’, and the name ‘being’ does not connote anything. 
This being the case, in accordance with the convention regarding analyticity (2.15), it 
follows that: 
(2.23) 
All positive existential propositions are analytic. 
Recall that a positive atomic proposition is analytic if and only if its predicate does not 
connote properties which are not connoted by the subject. Since ‘being’ does not connote 
anything, it is certain that whatever is the subject of a positive existential proposition, 
its predicate does not connote anything which is not connoted by the subject; thus, every 
positive existential proposition is analytic.20 
Nevertheless, every positive existential proposition is, according to Le´sniewski, false. 
His justiﬁcation of this claim is based on the convention on the truth-conditions of atomic 
propositions (2.9). Indeed, ‘S is a being’ is true iﬀ S has all properties connoted by 
‘being’. But, since there are no such properties, it is false that S has them. The fact that 
19“I have said that the predicate of a positive existential proposition which has been brought to the 
form of a proposition with a positive copula, does not connote anything, except — at most — the 
property of being greater than one. I maintain this because such a predicate is synonymous with the 
words ‘being’ or ‘beings’ which connote nothing else, even though they denote (‘denotation’ as used by 
Mill) everything. This view conﬂicts with J.S. Mill’s theory which says the word ‘being’ connotes the 
property of existing. I consider Mill’s theory wrong because, should the word ‘being’ really connote 
the property of existing, we could deﬁne that word as ‘that which has the property of existing’, or 
in other words, as a ‘being which has the property of existing’ (since the deﬁnition must indicate not 
only diﬀerentiae speciﬁcae, but also the genus); this would, then, give rise to an inevitable regressus 
in inﬁnitum. The word ‘being’ cannot be in fact deﬁned at all; the statement that this word does not 
connote anything is fully in keeping with this fact.” (1911: 4–5) 
20This is the main line of Le´sniewski’s argument for this claim. 

34 
Le´sniewski thought this argument sound indicates that he treated a sentence of the form 
‘all A are B’ as implying the existence of some A’s. If, instead, (2.9) was read as saying 
that it is true iﬀ no properties connoted by the predicate are not had by the object(s) 
denoted by the subject, the argument would not work. 
Now consider negative existential propositions. There are two options. A negative 
existential proposition is either analytic or it is synthetic. 
If S itself connotes the property of non-being, then ‘S is a non-being’ is analytic, and 
yet false. According to Le´sniewski, atomic propositions with contradictory subjects are 
contradictory themselves, and cannot be true (2.11). 
If ‘S’ does not connote the property of non-being, ‘S is a non-being’ is synthetic 
and the S is only said to have the property of non-being. But every ‘S’ is reducible to a 
name phrase ‘being which has properties A1, A2, A3, . . .’. So we have a proposition saying 
something equivalent to: 
(2.24) 
The being which has properties A1, A2, A3, . . ., is not a being. 
which is a contradictory proposition. 
Indeed, Le´sniewski’s conclusions seem to be quite awkward. He noticed this awk­
wardness and commented on it. It is interesting to see what he said about it. 
So, ﬁrst, it might be objected that the deﬁnitions that he uses in proving his con­
clusions are artiﬁcial. For Le´sniewski, the relevance of a classiﬁcation depends on its 
theoretical usefulness, i.e. on whether it allows us either to construct propositions or 
theories concerning all and only those objects which fall under one of the classes that 
our classiﬁcation singles out. Now, his classiﬁcation makes it easier to put forward some 
theoretical claims concerning all and only (simple) analytic propositions and other claims 
concerning all and only (simple) synthetic propositions. Some examples that Le´sniewski 
gave were: ‘All analytic propositions (and only these propositions) contain no such in­
formation about the objects symbolized by the subjects, that could not be deduced from 

35 
the meaning of the subjects’ and ‘All synthetic propositions (and only these propositions) 
contain such information about the objects symbolized by the subjects’. (1911: 9–10)21 
So, one may think, what Le´sniewski did is introduce a bunch of deﬁnitions which, 
together with some assumptions about how the language works, implied some claims that 
may sound bizarre. But they only sound awkward, because the terms that are used in 
those claims are taken in a diﬀerent meaning than the meaning that we usually associate 
with those terms. If I say ‘I will use the term ‘cow’ instead of the term ‘bat’, I will be 
committed to saying that ‘cows have wings’ and even though it sounds weird, it is true. 
Le´sniewski, however, treated his conclusions as if they actually had some bearing on 
what is true in the natural language. He seriously thought that his claims (even though 
they resulted from quite unusual deﬁnitions) held for the ordinary language. Here is 
what he says about that: 
The idea expressed in the preceding section contradicts current opinions con­
cerning existential propositions: the possibility of constructing both positive 
and negative, true existential propositions is commonly accepted. Thus e.g., 
21About the idea that some classiﬁcations are natural and some are artiﬁcial he says: “One hears, 
from time to time, of ‘natural’ and ‘artiﬁcial’ methods of classiﬁcation. People who use this form of 
expression do not usually limit themselves in characterizing particular methods of classiﬁcation, to the 
inclusion of these descriptively to either of the above categories; they usually combine such a descriptive 
characterization of methods of classiﬁcation with the teleological element of valuation, and they value 
‘natural’ classiﬁcations higher than artiﬁcial’ ones. The origins of the above characterizations of methods 
of classiﬁcation, and the positive or negative estimations which accompany these characterizations, can 
vary immensely from case to case. 
Some such cases are determined by various linguistic habits and traditions, others — by more or less 
well thought out and justiﬁed views concerning the problems of theoretical usefulness. 
The classiﬁcation of propositions into analytic and synthetic which I have carried out . . . can be, in view 
of at least one of its consequences, characterized as regarded by some as ‘artiﬁcial’. Such an ‘objection’ 
can in the ﬁrst place originate from the fact that one of the two classiﬁcation labels, i.e., that of analytic 
propositions, comprises two ‘very’ or ‘too’ heterogenous groups of propositions: (1) propositions whose 
predicates connote any properties but not those connoted by the subjects’, and (2) propositions whose 
predicates do not connote the properties connoted by the subjects only because they do not connote any 
features. 
I do not consider it my task to tone down all such dissonances if they arise solely from deeply rooted 
emotional impulses resulting from some linguistic habits, yet I cannot miss the opportunity to provide 
my classiﬁcation of propositions with a ‘safety valve’ against objections supported by arguments of 
theoretical usefulness of my classiﬁcation.” (1911: 9) 

36 
both the proposition ‘people exist’ and the proposition ‘square circles do not 
exist’ are considered true. 
I have taken pains to demonstrate the groundlessness of this common attitude 
towards existential propositions, all that remains for me to do is to cast some 
light on the probable origin of such a widespread error. [emphasis mine] 
(1911: 15) 
He also suggested that his claims about analytic propositions were claims about the 
same group of propositions which was referred to by other logicians and philosophers: 
In modern logic there is a widespread conviction that all analytic propositions 
are true. Those who advocate such a privileged position of analytic proposi­
tions in science claim that the principle of contradiction would be in jeopardy 
if any proposition could be false in spite of its being analytic [. . . But] some 
analytic propositions might be true, while others might be false. [. . . ] Thus, 
those scholars who hold that all analytic propositions are necessarily true 
propositions are in error. (1913b: 61–62) 
Next, he points out that sentences that seem to be true and existential are mis­
represented and their “adequate verbal symbols would be non-existential propositions” 
(1911: 15), that is, instead of ‘S exist(s)’, if we take it to be true, we should use ‘Some 
being(s) is(/are) S’ and by ‘S does not exist’ we should use ‘No being(s) is(/are) S’, if 
we want to represent our beliefs and intentions adequately.22 
There is something speciﬁc to note about his arguments. His reasoning for the claim 
that all positive existential propositions are analytic assumes that ‘being’ does not con­
note anything (for it is not deﬁnable by means of a classical deﬁnition). On the other 
22Although his explanation of how he got to this conclusions is somewhat awkward: “The semiotic 
analysis of the adequacy or inadequacy of certain propositions in relation to the contents which they 
represent is then ultimately based on a phenomenological analysis of the speaker’s representational 
intentions.” (1911: 17) 

37 
hand, his justiﬁcation of the claim that negative propositions are false assumes that ‘non­
being’ connotes something. It is far from obvious that by negating a predicate which does 
not connote something one can get a predicate connoting something.23 
A possible objection to this claim is this. It is possible to take any two disjoint B and 
C in order to obtain such a deﬁnition. The problem with this objection is that Le´sniewski 
accepted the classical notion of deﬁnition: B has to be a genus proximum and C has to 
be a diﬀerentia speciﬁca. Obviously this would be impossible had B and C been disjoint. 
2.4 The principle of contradiction 
In 1910,  Lukasiewicz published a book titled On the Principle of Contradiction in Aris­
totle, 24 in which he analyzed Aristotle’s position on the principle of contradiction. This 
led him to distinguishing at least three diﬀerent principles: (i) the logical principle of 
contradiction: 
(2.25) 
For no p : p and not−p are true simultaneously. 
(ii) the ontological principle of contradiction: 
(2.26) 
No being may possess and not possess at the same time one and the 
same quality. 
(iii) the doxastic principle of contradiction: 
(2.27) 
It is not possible to believe in a contradiction. 
23Le´sniewski appears to make two of the standard moves that were usually made those days. (i) He 
suggested that the surface form of a statement does not have to express its content adequately. (ii) 
He used quantiﬁcational devices to express existence. Although (i) seems to be a correct observation, 
Le´sniewski does not seem to have been inﬂuenced by a similar strategy of Russell’s or Frege’s. Probably, 
the extent to which he was acquainted with the western logical thought did not exceed a relatively simple 
formal theory given by  Lukasiewicz in his book on the principle of contradiction ( Lukasiewicz 1910). As 
to (ii), it is unclear which part of ‘Some object is S’ does the heavy lifting of existential import. In his 
early work, Le´sniewski was unclear about that. Later on, however, it was the copula ‘is’ that imported 
the existence rather than the quantiﬁcation. So, for example, it is a theorem of one of Le´sniewski’s 
systems that ∃a¬ex(a), i.e. ‘For some a, a does not exist’. 
24Which still has not been translated from Polish. 

38 
He argued that (2.27) as a factual statement is false (although it may have some worth 
as a methodological directive), and that Aristotle’s arguments for (2.25) and (2.26) are 
not conclusive. 
In his paper from 1912, Le´sniewski, against  Lukasiewicz, attempted a proof of the 
(ontological) principle of contradiction. The basic version in which he formulated that 
principle was: 
(2.28) No being can both possess and not possess one and the same property. 
Which was also equivalently stated as: 
(2.29) 
Every object is unable to both possess and not possess one and the 
same property. 
(2.30) 
Every P is unable to both have and not have c. 
The expression ‘both to possess and not to possess a property c’ will be abbreviated 
as ‘to be a contradiction’. ‘The expression ‘P is unable to be a contradiction’ was read 
by Le´sniewski as equivalent to a conjunction of two claims: 
(2.31) 
P is not a contradiction. 
(2.32) 
The sentence ‘P is not a contradiction’ is true a priori. 
where being true a priori, as it has already been said in the section on conventions (2.13), 
means being provable on the basis of linguistic conventions only. 
Le´sniewski’s argument for the Principle of Contradiction goes as follows: 
(2.33) ‘Some object is a contradiction’ is a contradictory proposition. 
By one of the conventions (regarding contradictory propositions), the sentence ‘Some 
object is a contradiction’ does not possess a symbolic function (2.11). However, it has 
a denoting subject and connoting predicate. Therefore, by the convention regarding the 

39 
truth and falsehood of contradicting propositions with denoting subjects and connoting 
predicates (2.10), the proposition: 
(2.34) 
Every object is not a contradiction. 
is true. Since the proof is based on the linguistic conventions only, the Principle of 
Contradiction is true a priori. 
Clearly, in some reasonable sense of the word ‘proof’, what Le´sniewski gave was a 
proof of the ontological Principle of Contradiction. Nevertheless, one can easily object 
that epistemically speaking the proof is not deeply satisfying; for the conventions on 
which it is based, especially that which says that no contradictory proposition possesses 
a symbolic function, seem to do the heavy lifting and to smuggle the conclusion in already. 
In other words, if someone rejects the ontological Principle of Contradiction, he probably 
will not accept the claim that contradictory propositions do not have a symbolic function 
(still, one has the sneaking suspicion that this convention is just the logical principle of 
contradiction in disguise); thus the main objection against this proof is that it is hard to 
see how it may convince anyone who does not believe in the Principle of Contradiction 
already. 
2.5 The principle of excluded middle 
Le´sniewski (1913b) makes a distinction between two formulations of the Principle of 
Excluded Middle (PEM). One refers to objects (the metaphysical PEM): 
(2.35) Every object has to stand, with respect to every property, either in 
the relation of possessing it or in the relation of not possessing it. 
the second refers to propositions (logical PEM): 
(2.36) At least one of two contradictory propositions has to be true.25 
25Although Le´sniewski did not give a deﬁnition of the contradictory of a sentence, from his discussion 

40 
He clearly states that his rejection of PEM will be the rejection of the logical version. 
He speaks of this version of PEM in not very favorable terms: 
The logical principle of the excluded middle not only does not help to resolve 
‘logical’ problems of various kinds, but it is in fact a dangerous theoretical 
obstacle which should be, therefore, removed from science. (1913b: 47) 
The argument against the logical version of PEM is: 
According to the convention regarding truth-conditions (2.9), for an atomic proposi­
tion of the kind ‘A is B’ to be true, there must be an object denoted by A, having all the 
properties connoted by B (recall that the reading of ‘all properties’ is strong here, so: ‘all 
properties and at least one property’). Hence, every atomic proposition whose subject 
does not denote anything is a false proposition, and every proposition whose predicate 
does not connote anything is a false proposition. 
Thus, contradictory sentences from the following pairs are false: 
(2.37) Every centaur has a tail. Some centaur does not have a tail. 
(2.38) Every square circle is a circle. Some square circle is not a circle. 
(2.39) Pegasus is an animal. Pegasus is not an animal. 
The ﬁrst two examples come from Le´sniewski, the last one does not (but still, given 
his truth conditions for simple propositions, it is also a good example).26 Since these 
it seems that this was a syntactic notion: if S is taken to be a singular term, the sentence contradictory 
with ‘S is P’ would be ‘S is not P’, and if S is taken to be a general term, then the sentence contradictory 
to ‘Some S is P ’ is ‘Every S is not P ’. 
26“Let us suppose that I am to answer the question of whether the following propositions are true: 
‘every centaur has a tail’, ‘a certain centaur does not have a tail’, ‘every square circle is a circle’, ‘a 
certain square circle is not a circle’. If we take into account the above analysis, the answer to this 
question becomes quite easy. Each of the four mentioned propositions is obviously false because the 
subject of each denotes nothing. The word ‘centaur’ which is the subject in the ﬁrst two propositions, 
and the expression ‘square circle’ being the subject in the remaining two — denote nothing because no 
object is a centaur and no object is a square circle. Thus, no object is such that it could be denoted only 
by the word ‘centaur’ or by the expression ‘square circle’. These expressions denote no objects, that is 
to say — they denote nothing.” (1913b: 59) 

41 
pairs are, according to Le´sniewski, pairs of contradictory propositions, they are coun­
terexamples to PEM. 
Thus, Le´sniewski rejects the equivalence: 
(2.40) (‘A is B’ is false) ≡ (A is not B)27 
Moreover, this account yields some speciﬁc examples of false analytic sentences: 
(2.41) Every contradictory object is contradictory. 
(2.42) A square circle is a circle. 
Note that according to Le´sniewski, the proposition contradictory to ‘S is P ’ is ‘S is not 
a P ’, which is not equivalent to ‘It is not the case that S is P .’ To some extent it allows 
one to think that his discussion is not a discussion of the Principle of Excluded Middle 
proper. Nevertheless, we will later see that the results given in this paper (however one 
would like to call them) will be important for further discussion (for example, for his 
solution of Russell’s paradox). Also, this issue allows us to see the diﬀerence between the 
metaphysical PEM and the logical PEM. Le´sniewski’s rejection of logical PEM does not 
undermine the metaphysical version; Le´sniewski still claimed that any existing object 
either has or does not have a given property, and the only case where the logical PEM 
might fail is when a subject of a sentence fails to denote.28 
27“The points raised . . . throw some light on the ‘problem’ of negative propositions. They demonstrate 
the falsehood of the theory of negative propositions, developed in considerable detail by Sigwart in his 
Logic and defended by some other modern logicians. According to this theory — the negative proposition 
‘A is not B’ is equivalent to the aﬃrmative proposition ‘the proposition ‘A is B’ is false’. . . Given the 
propositions ‘the centaur has no tail’, ‘a square circle is not a circle’ . . . the respective propositions . . . are 
‘the proposition ‘the centaur has a tail’ is false’ and ‘the proposition ‘the square circle is a circle’ is false’. 
The propositions of the type ‘A is not B’ . . . are in this case false because . . . they have subjects which 
denote nothing . . . For the same reason, the respective propositions of the type ‘A is B’, i.e. ‘the centaur 
has a tail’, ‘a square circle is a circle’ — are also false. If, however, the last two propositions are false, 
then the propositions stating their falsehood must be true.” (1913b: 59–60) 
28Even though Le´sniewski rejected one of the forms of the PEM, he did not divide sentences into 
true, false and indeterminate — according to him, if a PEM failure takes place, it is because both 
a sentence and its negation are false. Gelber (2004) suggested the following: “On the basis of his 
interpretation of Aristotle, for instance, Le´sniewski developed a three-valued classiﬁcation with true, 
false and indeterminate as the values” (p. 231). This is not Le´sniewski’s view. The charitable reading 
of Gelber is that Le´sniewski is there mistaken with  Lukasiewicz). 

42 
2.6 Eternity of truth 
Le´sniewski believed that any sentence that was true is and will be true, and that any 
sentence that was false is and will be false. In this sense, he believed in the eternity of 
truth. Unfortunately, he did not write a paper where he explains his views on this issue. 
Rather, much has to be read oﬀ from a paper where he criticized Tadeusz Kotarbi´nski, 
who believed that there are some sentences which are neither true nor false, that may 
become true or false with the ﬂow of time. Since Kotarbi´nski’s views are quite important 
for the development of many-valued logics (his views inspired  Lukasiewicz to construct his 
three-valued logic) and Kotarbi´nski’s paper has never been translated from Polish, I will 
start with a lengthy presentation of Kotarbi´nski’s views. Then I will turn to Le´sniewski’s 
criticism of those views. 
In 1913 Tadeusz Kotarbi´nski, a representative of the Lvov-Warsaw school, published 
a paper titled “The problem of the existence of the future.” This paper was far from 
providing clear justiﬁcation. It employs many metaphors, and it is hard to ﬁnd out what 
his arguments really are. What he argues for, however, is that if every sentence is either 
true or false, and sentences do not change their truth-value through time, then all actions 
are predetermined and there is no free will. The main line of reasoning seems to be the 
following.29 
29Here is a sample of his style in that paper: “Truly one has said that what has gone away has never 
ceased to exist — it only came into absence. What happened, truly happened; one who states that, states 
the truth, so this something does exist. To change the past — this is a mad idea. To give somebody 
the world of the past under his reign is to yield an enormous sphere of reality which he cannot reign. If 
impossibilities are prone to gradation, it is more impossible to reverse a yesterday’s ﬂight of a mosquito 
than to modify the usual moon’s trajectory tomorrow. What has happened cannot be undone. But 
really, is it only true about the past? Is it only the past things and events which are such and such, so 
that they cannot be not such and such, or is it also the things that are to come that are already such 
and such and not diﬀerent and they cannot come about as not such and such? Is it also the case that 
also in the future there is something that cannot be undone, because it has already happened? Many 
would ﬁrmly deny that. But after a consideration, having understood the issue, he would equally ﬁrmly 
assert it. And a scientiﬁcally educated man, with his eyes shut is eager to concede without a doubt that 
the whole future is such and such, and even though nothing in it has happened, it nevertheless cannot 
be undone. What is to come, allegedly diﬀers from what has gone by just as, for example, what happens 
now behind us in space diﬀers from what is happening in front of us . . . as a cloud above our heads from 

43 
Suppose it is true that p is a sentence true at t0. Then it is now true that p is true 
at t0. But if that is the case, I cannot do anything to change it, because it has already 
been ‘decided’ that p at t0 is to come. An analogous reasoning seems to apply to false 
sentences. Suppose that p is a sentence false at t0. Then, it is not false that p is true at 
t0. But if it is already so, there is nothing we can do to change it. 
Speaking more in terms of Kotarbi´nski’s terminology, Kotarbi´nski identiﬁes being 
an object of a true aﬃrmative judgment with existence (‘judgment’ is taken from Ko­
tarbi´nski’s terminology). He argues that if a judgement is true at some time t, then it 
is true at any time later than t. It follows, that whatever exists at some time t, exists 
at any time later than t (i.e. never ceases to exist), and whatever does not exist now, 
never comes to existence (for if what p states does not exist, then what not − p states 
does exist and continues do to so). This conclusion seems for him quite problematic. We 
usually believe that we can create something: whether it is a result of our moral action, 
or a subject of our artistic or intellectual activity. Since this (following his deﬁnition of 
existence) cannot be the case (at least he so believes), if the propositions referring to 
those created objects have already been true before the act of creation, he concludes that 
some propositions referring to future freely created objects are neither true nor false. 
This is just a guess about what the argument would have been like if Kotarbi´nski cared 
to formulate it as a clear argument. Here is how he originally phrased his view (again, I 
quote Kotarbi´nski at length since his work has not been translated): 
Truly, an enormous part of the things to come are, practically speaking, has 
more to do with the past than with the other things in the future. The ﬂow 
of sea currents, earthquakes, volcano eruptions, the rotations of heavenly 
bodies cannot be changed. We cannot make it true that golf stream will ﬂow 
through Poland, that the tomorrow’s golf stream’s ﬂow is here. With this 
another cloud above the Paciﬁc Ocean.” [My translation of (Kotarbi´nski,1913: 74)]. 

44 
sort of things we are powerless. No matter whether we leave them behind 
or whether they are in the future. We have to reckon with those to come as 
well as with those that has passed. Those things are such and such and their 
having those properties in the future exists even though they are in the future 
. . . It is already a true judgment which asserts that an object which lasts in 
the future will die. My inherence, pictorially speaking, of the property of 
being dead is true already. But is my every position in the future equally 
existent? Is the fact that I will die equally true as the fact that I will die at 
this speciﬁc time, and that this and no other job I will have, that among two 
roads I will choose the one on the right and not the one on the left, that in 
that speciﬁc moment such and such thought will cross my mind, raised by 
my attention in that moment, that I will make a vow (or not), abide by it 
(or not)? Is this also already true today and was it true centuries ago, or 
at least since my birth? No, never! Those things are undecided, they are in 
our hands, under our reign, and the great practical diﬀerence which divides 
everything in two spheres is not the present moment: it only crosses the 
present moment at some places. Of course, on the other side of the river that 
ﬂows on the border of our freedom, there remains the whole gigantic world 
of things that are ready to come, which already have the truth to accompany 
them. The freedom ends where the truth begins, not where the past comes 
into being. If I can do something, create it, it is not true that it already is. 
For how can one create what is, what happened or what already is created? 
One may, at most, create something similar, but not the very same thing. 
But neither what I can create is false. For how can one come to being, if 
the judgment stating its existence is false? If it came about (as created), we 
would have had a contradiction: a judgment about it would have been true 

45 
and false. Apparently, maybe not, but in fact — indeed. For we are talking 
not about making something which is not present a future thing. We are 
not talking about a microbe infecting a presently healthy man. We are not 
talking about covering a canvas which is now white with paint. We do not 
need creativity (in our ontological sense) for that; and this is what one has 
in mind when he denies intuitively the impossibility of creating something 
when the corresponding judgment about it is false. Only when we truly 
create, we create the truth. . . For, for something to truly come into being it 
is required that before it does, the judgment stating it to be not true. This 
is the condition of creativity. On the other hand, there is no creativity, if 
before that moment where the judgment is to begin to be true, it is false. 
For what is false, cannot become true. If it is false that in the moment t 
an object has a given feature, one cannot make it that this object has this 
feature at t, even if t is a future moment. Otherwise — a contradiction. For 
if one can make this happen, then the assertion of this achievement cannot 
contradict any true judgment, whereas from the assertion of this achievement 
it follows that the assertion of what is achieved is true, that it is true that 
the object has this feature in that moment, but the assumption says that 
it is false. Contradiction. If anyone wanted to argue that the possibility of 
doing something does not presuppose the existence of the result, but rather 
only that the result will exist, and that he does not presuppose the truth 
of the corresponding judgment now, but rather that later, when we perform 
the action, it will be true, one can answer what follows. If it is false that a 
given object has a given feature right now, it will never be true, even when 
the action will have been performed; moreover, it will still be false. So a 
certain judgment will be true and will not be true (it will even be false), so 

46 
— contradiction. For contradiction applies to the future, present and past 
existence equally. So, one cannot leave tomorrow, if we know today that who 
asserts this departure lies. [My translation of: (Kotarbi´nski, 1913: 79–80) 
The most striking feature of Kotarbi´nski’s view is that he identiﬁes truth with neces­
sity and falsehood with impossibility: 
Every truth is a necessity, every falsehood — an impossibility. For what 
is, has to be, because it cannot not be; if something is ready [i.e. already 
decided], but it is not, it cannot be, because already the judgment stating it 
is false, so it cannot become a truth. One can memorize it in a simpler way: 
a judgment is true if the thing is, and therefore when it is necessary, it is false 
— if the thing is impossible and contradictory with something that is.30 
In response to Kotarbi´nski,31 Le´sniewski published a paper: “Is all truth only true 
eternally or is it also true without a beginning?” (1913a). 
Le´sniewski begins with considering Kotarbi´nski’s deﬁnition of existence: 
(2.43) x exists if and only if x is an object such that an aﬃrmative judgment 
referring to it is true. 
Next, he adds some premisses of his own: 
(2.44) Every aﬃrmative judgment asserts that an object possesses a property 
(i.e. a relation of inherence). 
(2.45) 
Being an object to which a judgment refers is the same as being 
asserted by this judgment. 
30“Ka˙zda prawda jest konieczno´sci¸a, ka˙zdy fa lsz — niemo˙zliwo´sci¸a. Gdy co jest bowiem, by´c musi, 
bo nie by´c nie mo˙ze; gdy co´s gotowe jest, a nie jest, to by´c nie mo˙ze, bo ju˙z s¸ad o nim twierdz¸acy 
jest fa lszem, a wi¸ec nie mo˙ze si¸e sta´c prawd¸a. Mo˙zna wi¸ec pro´sciej sobie zapami¸eta´c: s¸ad prawdziwy 
jest, gdy rzecz jest, a wi¸ec gdy jest konieczna, fa lszywy — gdy niemo˙zliwa, sprzeczna z czym´s, co jest.” 
(Kotarbi´nski, 1913: 88–89) 
31Kotarbi´nski’s reasoning resembles the discussion in Peri Hermeneias, IX. 

47 
The conclusion is: 
(2.46) Only relations of inherence can exist. 
which, as he says, seems to contradict Kotarbi´nski, who explicitly stated his own exis­
tence.32 
Discussing Kotarbi´nski’s claim that what is gone by has not ceased to exists, Le´sniewski 
applies an intuitive notion of existence (without giving any deﬁnition) and, assuming that 
a relation of inherence exists at t if and only if it actually takes place at t, points out 
that a relation which has gone by (i.e. ceased to take place) no longer exists. 
Referring to Kotarbi´nski’s account of existence, Le´sniewski argues that an object can 
exist without a judgment referring to it being true, and that there are true judgments 
referring to objects which do not exist. The ﬁrst claim is supported by a nominalistic 
interpretation of Kotarbi´nski’s ‘judgment’: for it is possible that an object exists while 
no sentence-token referring to it exists. The second statement is being shown by means 
of examples of true sentences referring to past (and therefore, no longer existing) objects. 
The same nominalistic account can be found in Le´sniewski’s answer to the question 
of whether all true sentences are true eternally. Literarily speaking about tokens, it is 
doubtful that there are eternally existing tokens: inscriptions, utterances etc. However, 
in a more charitable interpretation of ‘being an eternal truth’, where ‘being true’ means 
‘being true if uttered’, in fact, says Le´sniewski, all true sentences are true eternally. 
32This does not seem to be a very charitable reading of Kotarbi´nski, who seems to have said that there 
are two diﬀerent notions of existence: 
Simply, the term in use is ambiguous. In one sense (which we will use) every object about 
which an aﬃrmative judgment stating it is true, and vice versa: a judgment stating its 
object is true if the object exists . . . in the other sense, the more colloquial one, only the 
present things exist, the past things existed and the future things will exist. 
My translation of the following passage: “Poprostu termin u˙zyty jest dwuznaczny. W jednym sensie, o 
jaki nam chodzi´c b¸edzie, istnieje, jest, ka˙zdy przedmiot, o kt´orym s¸ad twierdz¸acy, stwierdzaj¸acy go, jest 
prawdziwy, i odwrotnie: s¸ad stwierdzaj¸acy przedmiot jest prawdziwy, skoro ten przedmiot istnieje. . . W 
drugim sensie natomiast, w sensie potocznym, istniej¸a tylko rzeczy obecne, istnia ly przesz le, istnie´c b¸ed¸a 
przysz le.” (Kotarbi´nski, 1913: 75) 

48 
Le´sniewski’s argument for that claim goes as follows: 
(2.47) Suppose some judgement ‘A is B’ which is now true, will be false. 
Therefore: 
(2.48) At some time t later than now, ’A is B’ is not true. 
But: 
(2.49) Since ‘A is B’ is not true at t, ‘A is not B’ is true at t. 
This, Le´sniewski claims, constitutes a contradiction. He explicitly says: 
(2.50) 
“This assumption leads then to the conclusion that the judgment 
‘A is not B’, which contradicts the judgment ‘A is B’ true at the present 
time, becomes true at time t. An obstacle to the acceptance of the above 
conclusion is presented by the logical principle of contradiction which says 
that if one of two contradictory judgments is true, then the other must be 
false. Thus, if the judgment ‘A is B’ is true at the present time, we must 
conclude that the contradictory judgment ‘A is not B’ is always thus also at 
time t, false.” (1913a: 97–98) 
As a commentary to his argument, Le´sniewski adds that ‘A is B’ uttered at time t 
means ‘A at t is B’, which disarms a possible counterargument from tensed sentences.33 
33“One might say that my proof would be quite valid but for the fault that it does not ‘accord with 
reality’. To support this objection one might cite a ‘random’, it seems, judgment which is originally true 
and then ceases to be true, e.g., the judgment ‘Stanis law Le´sniewski will die’. This judgment is true for 
as long as I am alive; when I die it will become false because, when I shall not be here anymore, I shall 
not be able to die again. By becoming false at the time of my death, the judgment ‘Stanis law Le´sniewski 
will die’ will give way to the true judgment ‘Stanis law Le´sniewski died’ which in its turn is false until I 
shall die. 
This line of thought, with all its appearance of correctness, is not really valid and as such does not, 
I believe, shatter my above proof. The judgments: ‘Stanis law Le´sniewski will die’ uttered at diﬀerent 
times are by no means one and the same judgment — not even in the ﬁgurative sense in which (as I 
have noted at the beginning of this section) this expression is commonly used. These judgments assert 
diﬀerent things: thus e.g., the judgment ‘Stanis law Le´sniewski will die’ asserts, if uttered at the present 
time, the relation of inherence between myself and the property of coming to cease to be alive at a 
time which is in the future now, that is at 2 p.m., March 2nd, 1913. Should the judgment ‘Stanis law 

49 
The argument for the claim that all truth is true without a beginning is very similar. 
(2.51) Suppose some judgement ‘A is B’ which is now true, was false. 
Hence: 
(2.52) At some time t earlier than now, ’A is B’ was not true. 
But: 
(2.53) “Since ‘A is B’ is not true at t, ‘A is not B’ is true at t. 
And again, Le´sniewski says: 
(2.54) . . . on the basis of the law of contradiction — since the judgment ‘A 
is B’ is true at present, its contradiction ‘A is not B’ is always false, and so 
it was at time t”. (1913a: 103) 
Le´sniewski will die’ be uttered by someone after my death, e.g., at 5 a.m., February 7th, 2000, then it 
will assert the possession by me of the property of coming to cease to be alive at a time which is in the 
future at the moment this judgment is uttered, that is at 5 a.m., February 7th, 2000. Should I die, say, 
in 1925 then the ﬁrst of the two judgments . . . is true and the second is false because it is then true in this 
case that I possess the property of coming to cease to be alive at a time which is in the future, at 2 p.m., 
March 2nd, 1913 — and it is then false that I possess that property at some time which is in the future 
at 5 a.m., February 7th, 2000. This does not mean, however, that the same judgment . . . is true now 
and will later become false; it only means that of two judgments, even if they are phonetically identical 
but semantically (i.e. with respect to their function, sense) diﬀerent, following each other at consecutive 
times, the one is true and the other is false. However, these two are semantically diﬀerent (thus not the 
same) judgments, and they cannot be considered to be one and the same judgment in the above sense. 
Thus they cannot present an obstacle to the acceptance of all truths as eternally true. Similarly, such 
an obstacle would not be presented by any two phonetically alike judgments one of which is true and 
the other false, but which are not one and the same judgment, if they do not mean the same, if they 
assert diﬀerent objects. Such judgments are, among others, all such judgments which consist of words 
whose meaning depends on who, in what circumstances and when utters them, e.g., the words ‘I’, ‘you’, 
‘he’, ‘mine’, ‘yours’, ‘his’, ‘tomorrow’, ‘today’, ‘yesterday’, ‘here’, ‘there’, etc. Judgments asserting that 
something occurred in the past or that something will happen in the future or else that something is 
occurring at the present, but do not at the same time say who or what is the reference point for placing 
that something in past, future or present are not the same with other phonetically identical judgments 
uttered at other times. . . . However, if in any of the above judgments I substitute for the expressions 
whose meaning varies with time or circumstances such expressions whose semantic function is (for the 
given system of linguistic symbols) constant, I will be immediately met with truths that are eternally 
true. If, e.g., instead of judgments: ‘Stanis law Le sniewski will die’ or ‘Stanis law Le´sniewski will cease 
to be alive’ I formulate the judgment: ‘Stanis law Le´sniewski possesses the property of having ceased to 
be alive in the future of 2 p.m., March 2nd, 1913’, then this judgment will be always true.” (1913a: 
98–99) Indeed, we may safely assume that both Kotarbi´nski and Le´sniewski did not discuss the eternity 
of truth of temporarily indexical sentences and we can assume that the problem that they meant was 
rather whether those full-blown, precise sentences can change their truth values. 

50 
According to Le´sniewski’s account, the relation between the eternity of truth and 
freedom is not as straightforward as Kotarbi´nski suggested: in fact, we cannot ‘create 
the truth of sentences’ (as Kotarbi´nski metaphorically phrased it). However, it is not the 
case that ‘we create truly only when we create truth’ (Kotarbi´nski), because sentences 
can be true while the objects referred to in those sentences are not present. 
Kotarbi´nski’s argument, brieﬂy speaking, says: If a judgment saying that I shall 
do something is false, then it cannot be true. I a judgment cannot be true, I cannot do 
anything to make it true.Thus, if a judgment saying that I shall do something contradicts 
a true judgment then I cannot do it. 
Referring to Kotarbi´nski’s argument, Le´sniewski, instead of rejecting the ﬁrst pre­
miss,34 rejects the second one. Actually, what he says is quite interesting: 
The illustrious logician brings out however one more argument in support 
of his thesis: I cannot do anything such that the assertion which states my 
having accomplished it, contradicts a true judgment. Thus, I cannot not write 
Section 9 because the judgment saying that I shall not write it contradicts the 
judgment saying that I shall write it, that is the judgment we have initially 
assumed to be true. 
Still, this line of thought is not tenable either — it is, too, quite clearly 
logically arbitrary. I hope not to falsify Kotarbi´nski’s theoretical leanings in 
developing his line of thought, a logical ‘abbreviation’, in the following way: if 
a judgment saying that I shall do something cannot be true, then I cannot do 
it; if a judgment saying that I shall do something contradicts a true judgment, 
then it cannot be true. Thus — on the basis of the simple hypothetical 
34The premiss saying that if a judgement contradicts a true judgment (or: is false), it cannot be 
true. There is one reading in which it is plausible: 
♦( p ∧ p). But this reading do not justiﬁes the 
¬
¬
inference that Kotarbi´nski wants to make. On the other hand, the reading which underlies the inference: 
p 
♦p is far from obvious. It is equivalent to p 
p. Indeed, Kotarbi´nski explicitly says that every 
¬ →¬
→
true sentence is necessary and every false is impossible. But this is the premiss that sounds suspicious. 

51 
syllogism — if a judgment saying that I shall do something contradicts a 
true judgment then I cannot do it. It follows that I cannot not write Section 
9 because the judgment saying that I shall not write it contradicts the true 
judgment that I shall write Section 9. We see that one of the premisses of this 
line of thought is the assertion that I cannot do something if the judgment 
asserting that I shall do it cannot be true. I have indicated above that such 
a premiss is entirely arbitrary: it follows that all conclusions deduced from 
such a premiss are invalid. [sic!]” (1913a: 112–113) 
Basically, he rejects the conditional: 
(2.55) If it cannot be true that I will do something, then I cannot do it. 
by saying that it is true only if the negation of the consequent contradicts the antecedent. 
But, as he suggests ‘It cannot be true that I will do something’ does not contradict ‘I 
may do it’. Speaking of a particular example, he says: 
These two judgments, however, are of course not contradictory. They are 
by no means such two judgments that the one ascribes to an object such a 
property which the other does not; the ﬁrst of them ascribes some property to 
an assertion while the second ascribes it to myself. Someone might say that 
these judgments, while not involving an open contradiction, may yet contain 
a hidden one leading to a contradiction in the consequences. The answer to 
this is that such an assertion would require a proof and there is no reason 
to consider these two judgments contradictory until someone presents such a 
proof. But the same token, we must consider the thesis that if I could not 
write section 9 then it could be true that I shall not write it — as plainly 
and groundlessly arbitrary. However, since from the assumption that I may 
not write Section 9 does not by any means follow that it may be true that I 

52 
shall not write Section 9 (this would contradict the earlier thesis that such an 
assertion cannot be true), then Kotarbi´nski’s thesis that if the assertion that 
I shall not write Section 9 cannot be true then I cannot not write Section 9, 
is quite arbitrary. (1913a: 112) 
Interestingly, the arguments (forwards and backwards) for the eternity of truth apply 
(a) a kind of the principle of excluded middle (if a sentence is not true at t, then its 
negation is true at t), and (b) an unusual version of the principle of contradiction which 
says that if ‘A is B’ is true at present, its contradiction ‘A is not B’ is always false. 
With respect to (a), one may object that the principle of excluded middle has been 
rejected by Le´sniewski himself in his earlier paper. A possible response to this objection 
is that he still claimed the principle valid for sentences without empty or non-connoting 
names. Still, the value of such a response would depend on whether names can change 
their connotation or denotation in time (the example with Epimenides paradox shows 
that at least in some extraordinary cases they can). If it is possible that a future/past 
sentence does not have a denoting subject while its present version does, the application 
of the principle of excluded middle seems illegitimate. 
With respect to (b) it is possible to object that this formulation of the principle of 
contradiction (which diﬀers from his own formulation from his paper on this principle) 
already introduces the eternal aspect of truth, which is not present in many basic formu­
lations of this principle; for instance Aristotle’s formulation explicitly mentioned ‘being 
true at the same time’. 
Coming back to the usage of the principle of excluded middle in those reasonings: the 
whole discussion was seminal for  Lukasiewicz’s invention of three-valued logics. What 
 
was the claim that if a sentence is not true, it is false. Thus, 
Lukasiewicz rejected 
he introduced a third value, interpreted as ‘not yet determined’. The introduction of 
such a third value would invalidate Le´sniewski’s reasoning (though there are some other 

53 
diﬃculties to  Lukasiewicz account of future contingent propositions). 
2.7 Paradoxes 
In the course of discussing the issues described above, Le´sniewski approached a few 
paradoxes. Three of them (Nelson-Grelling’s, Meinong’s, Epimenides’) were discussed in 
passing in papers concerned mainly with something else, whereas Russell’s paradox was 
discussed speciﬁcally in 1914a and 1927. 
2.7.1 The Nelson-Grelling paradox 
The paradox35 consists in putting forward the following question: 
(2.56) Does a man who kills all and only people who do not commit a suicide 
kill himself? 
and reasoning: If he kills himself, then he is not among the people who do not commit 
a suicide, so he does not kill himself. If he does not kill himself, then he is among the 
people who do not commit a suicide, and thus he kills himself. 
Le´sniewski’s answer in (1913b: 74–77) was that both: 
(2.57) He kills himself. 
(2.58) He does not kill himself. 
are false, because there is no object which is a man who kills all and only people who do 
not commit a suicide. If there was such an object, this object would be contradictory. 
So, in other words: 
(2.59) It is not the case that he kills himself. 
35Grelling’s paradox is sometimes associated with quite a diﬀerent reasoning pertaining to heterolog­
icality. However, ‘Nelson-Grelling paradox’ is a term which Le´sniewski originally used. Indeed, this is 
similar to a formulation to be found in (Grelling and Nelson 1908). 

54 
is true, but it does not imply: 
(2.60) He does not kill himself. 
For the ﬁrst sentence does not imply that there is an object which does not kill 
himself, whereas the second proposition implies that there is such a person. 
2.7.2 Meinong’s paradox 
Meinong put forward the claim that whenever a judgement is being made, there is some­
thing about which this judgement is being made. Here is how he puts it: 
That knowing is impossible without something being known, and more gener­
ally, that judgments and ideas or presentations are impossible without being 
judgments about and presentations of something, is revealed to be self-evident 
by a quite elementary examination of these experiences. (Meinong 1960: 76) 
This also pertains to negative existential statements, when we state that something does 
not exist: 
. . . it is even more instructive to recall this trivial fact, which does not yet go 
beyond the realm of the Seinsobjektiv: Any particular thing that is not real 
must at least be capable of serving as the Object for those judgments which 
grasp its Nichtsein. It does not matter whether this Nichtsein is necessary 
or merely factual; nor does it matter in the ﬁrst case whether the necessity 
stems from the essence of the Object or whether it stems from aspects which 
are external to the Object in question. In order to know that there is no 
round square, I must make a judgment about the round square. . . Those who 
like paradoxical modes of expression could very well say: “There are objects 
of which it is true that there are no such objects”. (Meinong 1960: 82–83) 

55 
Speciﬁcally, Meinong seems to have been committed also to ‘Some objects are con­
tradictory’. Le´sniewski gave what he thought to be a generalized version of Meinong’s 
argument for this claim. Here is this general argument. 
Either it is true that there are no contradictory objects, or it is false that there are 
no contradictory objects. If the latter is the case, we easily get to the conclusion that 
some objects are contradictory. Suppose the former: 
(2.61) 
There are no contradictory objects. 
This seems to imply (at least on the Meinongian view): 
(2.62) 
A contradictory object is not an object. 
But ‘a contradictory object is not an object’ is true only if a certain object is contradic­
tory. Thus we have: 
(2.63) 
Some object is contradictory. 
The point of this paradox is that to deny the existence of contradictory objects one 
has to truly predicate something about them. True predication requires the existence of 
the objects of which something is predicated, and thus to be able to say truly about con­
tradictory objects that they do not exist one has to assume that there are contradictory 
objects.36 
Le´sniewski’s argues that there is a pretty simple criticism of the above reasoning. 
First, in the Le´sniewskian framework, the proposition ‘A contradictory object is not an 
object’ is false, because its subject does not denote anything. Yet, it is true that there 
36“. . . if it were true that there are no ‘contradictory objects’, in other words, no objects are contra­
dictory, then it would be true that ‘a contradictory object is not an object’. It can be, however, true 
that ‘a contradictory object’ is not an object only in the case when a certain object is ‘contradictory’. 
If no object were ‘contradictory’, then no proposition about the ‘contradictory object’ could be true, 
including the proposition ‘a contradictory object is not an object’. Thus, if it were true: ‘a contradictory 
object is not an object’, then it must be also true that a certain object is contradictory. This being 
so, the assumption made at the beginning that no object is ‘contradictory’ entails the conclusion that a 
certain object is ‘contradictory’.” (1913b: 62–63) 

56 
are no contradictory objects. Hence, ‘a contradictory object is not an object’ is not just 
a reformulation of the premise and does not follow from it. 
Following Le´sniewski’s remarks on existential propositions, the non-existence of con­
tradictory objects should be rather expressed by (or parsed as): 
(2.64) No object is contradictory. 
which is true and does not imply the existence of any contradictory object, in contrast 
to (2.61) or (2.62). 
2.7.3 Epimenides’ paradox (Liar) 
The paradox, in Le´sniewski’s formulation, consists in the following reasoning: 
Suppose that Epimenides during the time between t1 and t2 utters exactly one sen­
tence, viz. 
(2.65) The sentence asserted by Epimenides at time t1 – t2 is false. 
Is this sentence, as uttered by Epimenides, true or false? 
Suppose it is false. Then, what is stated in this sentence does not take place. Hence, 
it is not the case that the sentence uttered by Epimenides at time t1 – t2 is false (for this 
is what the sentence states). But, if it is not false, it is true. 
Suppose it is true. Then, what is stated in this sentence takes place. So it is the case 
that the sentence uttered by Epimenides at time t1 – t2 is false. 
Le´sniewski’s solution to this paradox makes use of (2.14), which is a somewhat arti­
ﬁcial restriction on what names can refer to, and the following claims: 
(2.66) Sentences, understood as inscriptions or sounds, are the proper truth 
bearers. 
(2.67) All aﬃrmative categorical sentences with non-denoting subjects are 
false. 

57 
Now consider the expression ‘The sentence asserted by Epimenides at time t1 – t2’ as 
uttered by Epimenides at time t1 – t2 (as it occurred in the sentence which he uttered). 
Does it denote at all? Following Le´sniewski’s convention regarding the denotation of 
connoting expressions, it denotes all and only those sentences asserted by Epimenides 
at time t1 – t2, which have no (numerically) common element with the expression ‘the 
sentence asserted by Epimenides at time t1 – t2 ’ as uttered by Epimenides in t1 – t2. But 
there is no such a sentence. Therefore, this noun phrase does not denote anything.37 
Knowing that the subject of Epimenides’ sentence does not have a denotation, Le´sniewski 
could truly say in 1913: 
(2.68) 
The sentence asserted by Epimenides at time t1 – t2 is false. 
It is an expression equiform to that uttered by Epimenides. Nevertheless, it was true, 
while the one uttered by Epimenides is false. Why? 
Consider the subject of the sentence uttered by Le´sniewski: ‘The sentence asserted 
by Epimenides at time t1 – t2’. The sentence actually asserted by Epimenides (a) has all 
properties connoted by this subject, and (b) does not have any expression (numerically) in 
common with this subject. Therefore the subject of the sentence uttered by Le´sniewski 
denotes the sentence uttered by Epimenides. Moreover, since the sentence uttered by 
Epimenides does not have a denoting subject, it is true (when uttered by someone else 
than Epimenides, or by Epimenides but not at t1 – t2) that it is false. 
Note also that from the fact that the sentence uttered by Epimenides is false it does 
not follow that it is true, because its subject does not refer to this sentence itself and 
because the principle of excluded middle fails for sentences with non-denoting subjects). 
There are some interesting aspects of this solution. First of all, it seems to be one 
of the very ﬁrst (in modern logic) applications of some sort of a restriction excluding 
self-reference to the Liar paradox. 
37This indeed follows if we accept the condition put on names in (2.14). 

58 
Second, it assumes that truth-value ascription is token-based. Two tokens of the same 
sentence (type) which do not contain any indexical expressions, uttered at two distinct 
occasions can have diﬀerent truth-value. 
Third, this solution does not rescue us from some other versions of the liar paradox. 
The assumption (2.14) about the denotation of connoting expressions is too weak. Indeed, 
assume that no name names an expression of which it is a part. This does not undermine 
for example the following formulation: 
(2.69) 
Sentence (2.70) is true. 
(2.70) 
Sentence (2.69) is false. 
No name in (2.69)–(2.70) names an expression of which it is a part. Still, a contra­
diction is derivable if we assume that every sentence is either true or false. Perhaps, a 
stronger assumption should have been taken to avoid the liar. Say, something like ‘No cir­
cularity in naming should take place’, that is, if we start with a given name, say m0, then 
there are no expressions m1, . . . , mk such that mi names a part of mi+1 and mk = m0. 
But this assumption is pretty strong and it seems to restrain us from considering some 
sentences which seem quite innocently true. Another apparent problem is that this does 
not provide a way out of the Yablo’s paradox.38 I do, however, believe that there is an 
interesting lesson here and that Le´sniewski’s intuitions here are not wholly misguided. 
I will return to the issue in the more technical part of this dissertation once the formal 
system called quantiﬁed name logic is introduced. 
This strengthened version of a solution is interesting for another reason. Quite a few 
approaches to some paradoxes consist in claiming paradoxical sentences to be meaning­
less. In contrast, Le´sniewski’s approach makes them false, without making their negations 
38It does seem to avoid the revenge of the liar, though. For consider a sentence P : ‘This sentence is 
not-true’. Since ‘This sentence’ as it occurs in P fails to refer, the sentence comes out false. This fact, 
however, does not imply that P is true because it would imply this only had the occurrence of ‘This 
sentence’ in P succeed in referring to P itself, which on Le´sniewski’s view it does not do. 

59 
true (and that is where he employs his rejection of the principle of excluded middle). 
2.7.4 Russell’s paradox 
Le´sniewski’s approach to Russell’s paradox is quite speciﬁc. As he addresses the problem 
in (1914a) he applies pretty much the same strategy which he applied in his earlier 
papers. He introduces his own understanding of certain notions and then argues that 
in this sense the solution is such-and-such. This is especially obvious when he discusses 
Russell’s paradox. He preserves its verbal formulation but as he goes on explaining how 
his solution is supposed to work it becomes more and more clear that what he means by 
‘class’ is not what Frege or Russell meant by ‘class’. Rather, he accepts the mereological 
understanding of classes.39 
The basic notion used in Le´sniewski’s early solution to Russell’s paradox (1914a) is 
‘the class of object(s) n’ (we will use ‘Kl(n)’ in symbols), where n is a noun phrase. 
As phrased by Le´sniewski, the paradox assumes that one of the following sentences 
is true: 
(2.71) 
The class of classes not subordinated to themselves is subordinated 
to itself. 
(2.72) 
The class of classes not subordinated to themselves is not subordi­
nated to itself. 
where by ‘subordinated to’ Le´sniewski apparently means ‘being an element of’. Next, 
the paradoxical reasoning indicates that each of the above sentences implies the other, 
thus yielding a contradiction. 
Le´sniewski, referring to his discussion of the principle of excluded middle, points out 
that if no object is the class of classes not subordinated to themselves, then both sentences 
39This move will be discussed in detail in the chapter on Mereology. Problems with Le´sniewski’s 
solution to Russell’s paradox will be also discussed later on. Here I just focus on presenting his solution 
as he suggested it in his early writings. 

60 
are plainly false, without implying a contradiction. Assuming that there is no empty set, 
to show that no object is the class of classes not subordinated to themselves, it suﬃces 
to show that every class is subordinated to itself. That is what Le´sniewski actually does. 
Let us consider his argumentation in more detail. 
Before I describe the main assumptions of Le´sniewski’s argument I will explain the 
use of variables in his arguments. For the needs at hand it is enough to think about 
variables substitutionally. The substitution class contains all possible countable noun 
phrases. The diﬀerence between capital and lower case name variables is not essential. 
When Le´sniewski wants to emphasize that the satisfaction of a formula requires that an 
individual name be substituted for a variable, he uses a capital letter. So, for instance ‘an 
object P is subordinated to a class K iﬀ for some a . . . ’ does not contain variables of three 
diﬀerent sorts. Moreover, there is no speciﬁc sorts of variables for classes. Le´sniewski 
just uses P and K to keep track of what variable stands for what (P is the ﬁrst letter of 
‘przedmiot’ — ‘object’ in Polish, and K is the ﬁrst letter of ‘klasa’ — ‘class’). 
(2.73) 
There is no empty class. 
(2.74) 
Kl(Kl(n)) = Kl(n) 
(2.75) Every categorical sentence with an empty subject is false. 
(2.76) 
The universe of existing objects is the class of all objects which are 
not the universe. 
and one of the following three claims is true: 
(2.77) 
An object P is subordinated to a class K iﬀ for some a (‘for some 
substitution of a possible countable noun phrase’) the following two conditions 
are fulﬁlled: 
1. K is a class of objects a. 

61 
2. P is a. 
(2.78) 
An object P is subordinated to a class K iﬀ for every a the following 
two conditions are fulﬁlled: 
1. K is a class of objects a. 40 
2. P is a. 
(2.79) 
An object P is subordinated to a class K iﬀ for every a: K is a class 
of objects a iﬀ P is a. 
Le´sniewski starts with rejecting options (2.78) and (2.79) from the above trilemma. 
Rejection of (2.78). Suppose that (2.78) works. Take a to stand for ‘a square circle’. 
For no P it is true that P is a square circle. Therefore, there is a name (‘a square circle’) 
which, substituted for a always falsiﬁes both conditions formulated in (2.78). The ﬁrst 
condition is falsiﬁed because on Le´sniewski’s view there is no empty class and the class 
of square circles would have to be empty (and simple sentences with empty subjects are 
false). The second condition is false because nothing is a square circle. Thus, for any P 
and K it is not the case that for every name a: K is the class of objects a and P is a. 
Thus no object is subordinated to any class. 
Rejection of (2.79). Suppose that (2.79) is true and that an object P is subordinated 
to a class K. The reasoning is a little bit more complicated. Take: 
(2.80) a means ‘P or not P ’. 
Clearly: 
(2.81) For any object Q, Q is P or not P. 
40I translate using the indeﬁnite article: ‘a class of objects’, because the assumption is not taken to 
imply the uniqueness of a class of objects a. 

62 
Thus: 
(2.82) P is a. 
is obviously fulﬁlled. Therefore (according to the assumption that both conditions (1) 
and (2) of (2.79) are fulﬁlled whenever one of them is fulﬁlled): 
(2.83) K = Kl(a) is the universal class. 
Here, Le´sniewski makes use of the assumption that Kl(a) = Kl(Kl(a)). Thus: 
(2.84) K = Kl(Kl(a)) 
Therefore, if a from the formulation of (2.79) is substituted by ‘the universal class’, the 
condition (b) is satisﬁed: 
(2.85) K is the class of the universal class. 
Again, using the assumption that if one of the conditions is satisﬁed, the other one 
is satisﬁed as well, we have that: 
(2.86) P is the universal class. 
On the other hand, replace a from the formulation of (2.79) by ‘an object which is 
not a universal class’. Then (since, by (2.76), the universal class is the class of objects 
which are not the universe) again: 
(2.87) Kl(a) is the universal class 
Since we already know that K is the universal class, we can conclude that the ﬁrst 
condition from the formulation of (2.79) is satisﬁed. Hence, we also have the other one: 
(2.88) P is an object which is not the universal clas. 
which yields a contradiction with (2.86). 
Given Le´sniewski’s assumptions, the only remaining possibility is (2.77). 
This formulation has two interesting consequences: 

63 
(2.89) 
Every object n is subordinated to Kl(n). 
(2.90) 
Not every object subordinated to Kl(n) is an n. 
The ﬁrst claim is quite simple. Suppose P is n. Then, there is a class of objects n. 
Therefore, for some a (namely n) both conditions for P ’s being subordinated to Kl(n) 
are satisﬁed, which implies that P is subordinated to Kl(n). 
The second claim, which at ﬁrst seems weird, can serve as an example of how ‘being 
subordinated to’ is (tacitly, at this point) connected with ‘being a part’. Consider a 
sphere Q. As Le´sniewski says, the class of (all) halves of the sphere Q is the sphere Q 
itself. The sphere Q is also the class of (all) quadrants of Q. Thus, we have the conclusion 
that any half of Q is subordinated to the class of quadrants of Q. It is a general point to 
which we will get back when discussing Le´sniewski’s understanding of class, that given 
two names such that the whole constituted by all objects denoted by the ﬁrst is also 
the whole constituted by all objects denoted by the second, any object denoted by the 
ﬁrst name is subordinated to the class of objects denoted by the second name, even if no 
object denoted by the ﬁrst name is denoted by the second name. 
Now we are ready to give the argument for the main thesis, saying that every class is 
subordinated to itself. 
Suppose K is Kl(n) for some n. Clearly: 
(2.91) K = Kl(n) = Kl(n) ∪ Kl(n) 
where ‘∪’ stands for the union of classes. According to one of the assumptions, Kl(Kl(n)) = 
Kl(n). So we have: 
(2.92) K = Kl(n) = Kl(Kl(n)) ∪ Kl(n) 
The union of the class of class(es) of objects n and the class of objects n is the same 
as the class of objects which are a class of objects n or n: 

64 
(2.93) Kl(Kl(n)) ∪ Kl(n) = Kl(Kl(n) or n) 
where ‘ or’ is a disjunction of name arguments, deﬁned by: 
(2.94) P is (Q or R) iﬀ P is Q ∨ P is R 
Thus we have: 
(2.95) K = Kl(n) = Kl(Kl(n) or n) 
Since K is Kl(n), it is also (Kl(n) or n). Hence, we know two things: (a) K is the 
class of (Kl(n) or n), and (b) K is (Kl(n) or n). This implies that K is subordinated to 
itself. 
This is the main solution to Russell’s paradox. 
Another objection which Le´sniewski put forward against the standard formulation of 
Russell’s paradox was that the inference from: 
K is subordinated to the class of classes which are not subordinated to them­
selves. 
to: 
K is not subordinated to itself. 
is invalid. In fact, if we assume the mereological account of class, we think of the class of 
objects P as a whole consisting of all of P ’s as parts. Moreover, as we will later explain 
in more detail (in the chapter on Mereology), being an element of (or being subordinated 
to) this class does not force an object to be a P itself. It may as well be a part of a P or 
a whole consisting of a few of P ’s or a whole consisting of some parts of some P ’s. 
For example, let us have a herd of ten cows: a1, a2, a3, . . . , a10. Let us use the name 
‘stone α’ as a name which can be truly predicated of all and only of our cows. Now, 
‘Kl(cow(α)) is a name of our herd. Being an element of a herd is, in accordance with 

65 
Le´sniewski, the same as being a part of it.41 Thus, not only our cows are subordinated 
to this class (there are also halves of cows, their legs, heads, pairs of cows etc.). Clearly, 
being subordinated to the class Kl(cow(α)) does not imply being a cow (a cow’s leg is 
not a cow). 
Note also that the assumption (2.76), which is used in Le´sniewski’s rejection of (2.79) 
also shows some predilections towards the mereological understanding of the class. For 
take the name ‘all objects that are not the universal class’. The class of all objects 
that are not the universal class on the distributive (non-mereological) reading is not 
the universal class, for there is some object which (by (2.79), which seems to mirror 
distributive intuitions quite adequately) is not its element (namely, the universal class). 
On the other hand, on the mereological reading the class of a is the mereological fusion 
of all objects a. This being the case, in some sense, the universal class is nothing over 
and above the fusion of all other objects in the world. The universal class is a part of 
the fusion of all objects that are not the universal class. But then, because Le´sniewski 
identiﬁed being an element of a mereological set with being a part of it (proper or not), 
the universal class is the ‘maximal element’ of the mereological class of objects which are 
not the universal class, i.e. it is the very same class we are talking about. 
Le´sniewski returned to this paradox after developing his logical systems. An in­
teresting (although problematic) discussion of this formal treatment is to be found in 
(Soboci´nski 1949b). I will discuss this approach later, in section 4.5. 
2.8 On universals 
Le´sniewski devoted some space to the rejection of the existence of abstract objects 
(1913b: 50–53). This reasonings starts with a deﬁnition of a ‘general object’: 
41Well, roughly speaking. An example with a heap of stones might work better here, but cows are 
more picturesque. 

66 
(2.96) 
A is general with respect to a group of objects iﬀ it possesses only 
those properties which are common to all these corresponding objects 
For instance, the universal ‘man’ cannot have any properties common only to a few 
men. The argument now proceeds as follows: 
Suppose there is an object Pk which is general with respect to individuals P1
0, P 2
0, . . . , P n
0. 
For every individual object Pk
0 one can always ﬁnd certain property ck which is not com­
mon to all individual objects P1
0, P 2
0, . . . , P n
0. For instance, the property of being identical 
to Pk
0. Hence, Pk does not possess the property ck. 
Moreover, the individual object Pk
0 does not possess the property of not possessing 
the property ck. Hence, the general object Pk does not possess the property of not 
possessing the property ck. It follows that Pk possesses the property ck. Thus, any 
general (universal) object is contradictory. 
This argument may be rejected by introducing a diﬀerent account of universals. For 
instance, one may make a distinction between the properties of the universal itself (like: 
being universal, being immaterial, being abstract etc.) and the content of the universal. 
The universal ‘man’ can be said to be abstract whereas no individual man is an abstract 
object. Introducing the notion of content to the account of universals seems to refute 
Le´sniewski’s objection. Whereas if object does not have the property of not possessing 
the property ck, then it possesses the property ck itself, it is doubtful that if the property 
of not possessing the property ck is not in the content of a universal, then the property 
of ck is in the content of this universal. With respect to a given content properties are 
not divided in two groups: those, which belong to the content, and those, whose negated 
properties belong to the content. Rather, they divide in three groups: those who belong 
to the content, those the negated properties of which belong to the content, and those 
which are not ‘decided’ by the content, i.e. such properties that neither themselves nor 
their negated properties belong to the content. 

67 
Gryganiec (2000) suggests also another reason to treat the deﬁnition used by Le´sniewski 
as inadequate. Here is how he formulates his argument: 
The incorrectness of the deﬁnition of the object Op can be also shown in a 
diﬀerent way. Suppose there are two individual objects P1 and P2. Assume 
moreover that the ﬁrst one, that is P1, possesses n properties, whereas the 
second one — P2 — n+m properties. We do not decide here whether symbols 
n and m denote ﬁnite or inﬁnite sets of properties; we only know that those 
sets exhaust the ontic furnishing of those objects. The universal Op{P 1,P 2} 
with respect to objects P1 and P2 — according to Le´sniewski’s deﬁnition — 
will only have the properties common to objects P1 and P2. Therefore, the 
object Op{P 1,P 2} will have n properties. This being the case, Op{P 1,P 2} — 
thanks to the principle of extensionality — will be identical with the object 
P1, which also properties n properties, that is, it will be an individual.42 
Granted that by n and m Gryganiec understands sets of properties and not the cardi­
nalities of those sets (he is somewhat ambiguous about it, but if we do not grant it, the 
argument obviously will not work), the argument is not very compelling. First, Gryganiec 
assumes that for P1 and P2 their universal exists. But neither Le´sniewski’s argument nor 
the Platonist position requires that for any two objects there be an objects which is their 
universal. But this is a minor scratch. More importantly, Gryganiec asks us to assume 
that there exist two distinct individual objects one of which has all the properties that the 
other has (and the other one has some other properties as well). But such a possibility 
42“B l¸edno´s´c okre´slenia przedmiotu Op mo˙zna wykaza´c na innej jeszcze drodze. Za l´o˙zmy, ˙ze istniej¸a 
dwa przedmioty indywidualne P1 i P2. Za l´o˙zmy ponadto, ˙ze pierwszy z nich, czyli P1, posiada n cech,

— b¸edzie przedmiotem identycznym z przedmiotem P1, kt´ory r´ownie˙z posiada n cech, czyli b¸edzie 
przedmiotem indywidualnym.” 

68 
is hard to conceive. 
If one admits that being identical to an object is a property, and that not having a 
property is also a property, then take the property of being identical to P2 (call it f). P1 
clearly does not have property f. Then P1 has the property of not having the property 
f. But since P2 has all the properties that P1 has, also P2 has the property of not having 
the property f, that is it has the property of not having the property that it obviously 
has, which does not seem possible. 
If, on the other hand, not having a property is not treated as a property, Le´sniewski’s 
argument does not work anyway and there is no point in putting forward the example. 
Also, even if we go this way (or if we deny that being identical to an object is a property), 
a weaker and yet reasonable notion property will be required. Now, the problem is that 
spatio-temporal location seems to be a good candidate for a property of an individual 
even in a weaker sense. Then, P2 could not have all the properties that P1 has unless 
they overlapped. But if overlapping non-identicals is the metaphysical construct that 
has to be conjured to make the argument work, the argument does not seem to be very 
strong. 
Le´sniewski later formulated a formalized version of his argument; the new version did 
not employ the notion of a property and was expressed in the language of Ontology. I will 
get back to this argument in section 4.5 after introducing the required formal apparatus. 
2.9 Further readings 
As for Le´sniewski’s philosophical views, a good (but not very critical or analytic) place 
to start is (Luschei 1962). For a reader who wishes to see the character in a wider per­
spective, (Wole´nski 1985) is the classic — a good translation of it is (Wole´nski 1989). He 
has a chapter on Le´sniewski, which as far as technical aspects of the logical systems are 

69 
concerned is much more detailed than Luschei’s book, but it is far from being comprehen­
sive. Other background-covering works are Wole´nski (1986a and 1999). The Polish school 
of logic is presented in a more general survey on the development of logic between the 
two world wars in (Grattan-Guinness 1981). Jadczak (1993a,b) discusses Le´sniewski’s 
role in the Lvov-Warsaw school. Le´sniewski’s letters to Kazimierz Twardowski have 
been recently published as (Le´sniewski 1999). The question whether Le´sniewski was a 
philosopher at all is asked (and answered positively) by Wole´nski (2000). 
Sanders (1996) discusses informally Le´sniewski’s motivations for his systems in quite 
a recent paper. However he does not go beyond the content of (Luschei 1962) and 
(Poli and Libardi 1999). A very good, but quite informal survey of Le´sniewski’s achieve­
ments is (Kearns 1967), which also contains an interesting evaluation of Le´sniewski’s 
work. Kearns argues that Le´sniewski’s view of the world is “defective in that it does not 
recognize structure” (p. 88), which, he suggests, deprives “Mereology of signiﬁcance”. 
This is an interesting issue, even if Kearns’ explanations are somewhat imprecise. Rickey 
(1976, reprinted as Srzednicki and Stachniak 1998) provides a more technical overview of 
some results about Le´sniewski’s systems obtained before 1972. An interesting survey of 
technical aspects of Le´sniewski’s work, especially of the relation between Ontology and 
set theory has been published by Surma (1977). 
Le´sniewski’s view on truth-bearers in the context of the Lvov-Warsaw school is pre­
sented in (Wole´nski and Rojszczak 2005). 
Sinisi (1966) discusses Le´sniewski’s criticism of Whitehead’s theory of events. 
Betti (2004) presents Le´sniewski’s solution to the liar paradox and argues that it 
was Le´sniewski and not Tarski who suggested regimentation of natural language as a 
device which is necessary to avoid paradoxes. Her account, however, is mainly historical 
and does not focus on the argumentative aspects of the issue. Regarding paradoxes, an 
interesting account which employs some of Le´sniewski’s ideas is (Hi˙z 1984). The relation 

70 
between the early and informal solution to Russell’s paradox from 1914 and the later 
development of Le´sniewski’s formal systems are explored by Sinisi (1976). 
Le´sniewski’s nominalism is nicely discussed by Hintze (1995), and the connection 
between it and Goodman’s approach is explored by Prakel (1983). Simons provides a good 
introduction to Le´sniewski’s nominalistic inscriptional approach to metalogic (2002) and 
provides a good background on nominalism in the Lvov-Warsaw school (1993, reprinted 
in Srzednicki and Stachniak 1998). 
Tadeusz Kotarbi´nski, Le´sniewski’s good friend, used Le´sniewski’s systems as a tool 
while putting forward his own reism (Kotarbi´nski 1929). As Wole´nski (1986b) convinc­
ingly explains, Ontology itself is neutral with respect to the problem and it is rather 
the form of the logical system which makes it easier to speak of reducing various non-
concrete terms to other terms. In other words, Le´sniewski’s systems do not contain terms 
intended to represent abstract entities, but if there were such entities, it would be possible 
to express facts about them in Le´sniewski’s languages. 
There is also an interesting connection between Brentano’s analysis of categorical 
propositions and Ontology, explored in (Simons 1984). 
A somewhat surprising similarity between Le´sniewski and Mally has been discovered 
and described by Gombocz (1979). 
Le´sniewski’s systems are also known for their application to history of philosophy. 
Thom (1986) interestingly attempts to cast new light on Parmenides, Gorgias, Leucippus 
and Democritus using a modiﬁed version of Ontology. Henry (1972, 1969) attempted to 
apply Le´sniewski’s logics to analysis of some medieval concepts. 

Chapter 3 
Le´sniewski’s Protothetic 
3.1 Introduction 
Le´sniewski’s ﬁrst step in his logical investigation was a construction of a set theory (1916) 
which was meant “to contribute as much as possible to the justiﬁcation of modern math­
ematics” (1916: 129). It was the ﬁrst formulation of his theory of parthood (Mereology). 
It was not really formalized yet. He used variables, introduced axioms and deﬁnitions, 
and proved theorems. Except for the use of variables, however, all these were given in a 
regimented version of the natural language.1 Even later, until 1931, when he published 
on his Mereology, the level of formalization of his deliberations did not change (see 1928; 
1930a; 1930b; 1931a). Only around 1930 he started publishing theoretical considerations 
regarding the logic underlying his Mereology: 
While using colloquial language in scientiﬁc work and attempting to con­
trol its ‘logic’, I endeavored to somehow rationalize the way in which I was 
using in colloquial language various types of propositions passed down to 
us by ‘traditional logic’. While relying on ‘linguistic instinct’ and the often 
non-uniform tradition of ‘traditional logic’, I attempted to devise a consis­
tent method of working with propositions which were ‘singular’, ‘particular’, 
‘general’, ‘existential’ etc. . . . Having acquired considerable experience in the 
consistent scientiﬁc operation with these ‘singular’ propositions2 and having 
1Later, he commented: “In the year 1915 I made a ﬁrst attempt to give a deductive form to my 
conception of classes and collections, which I was using in the analysis of the ‘antinomy’ of Russell. 
Relying on four propositions called axioms, and using a number of other propositions which I called 
deﬁnitions, I arrived at a number of interesting theorems with methods which I was then able to use.” 
(1928: 227) 
2I.e. propositions of the form ‘a is b’. 
71 

72 
at my disposal a considerable number of what were for me thoroughly re­
liable theoretical syntheses which, although they were constructed more or 
less ad hoc and not formulated within the limits of a deductive system, nev­
ertheless made it much easier for me to elucidate for myself and others the 
subtleties of my scientiﬁc language, I wished to take one step further and, us­
ing the ‘singular propositions of the type ‘A ε b’, to base all my deliberations 
on some clearly formulated axiomatization which would harmonize with my 
theoretical practice in this domain at that time. (1931b: 366–367) 
The system resulting from this investigations, which dealt mainly with predication 
was called ‘Ontology’. Technically, the ﬁrst single axiom of this system was formulated 
in 1920, but for quite a while Le´sniewski did not publish about it. 3 
Quite in parallel, he started working on a theory that coped with the propositional 
aspect of his reasonings. In 1921, inspired by  Lukasiewicz’s modiﬁcation of Nicod’s system 
( Lukasiewicz 1921) he postulated two things: (i) that his propositional calculus should 
have only one primitive symbol, and (ii) that there should be no additional symbol for 
deﬁnitions, but rather that deﬁnitions should be written using that primitive term.4 
In 1922 Tarski, Le´sniewski’s only Ph.D. student, proved that if the universal quan­
tiﬁer binding propositional variables is admitted, the equivalence sign suﬃces as the 
only sentential connective in a functionally complete propositional calculus. Since then, 
they cooperated on the construction of both a theory of propositional deduction (called 
‘Protothetic’ from ‘ﬁrst theses’ in Greek, loosely speaking) and of a theory which may 
3“This theory has for some time now become known to a wider circle of my colleagues and students 
through copies of my university lectures.” (1930b: 608) 
4“In deﬁning the functions of the theory of deduction in terms of other such functions, both Sheﬀer and 
Nicod use a special equal-sign for deﬁnitions which they do not deﬁne in terms of the primitive functions 
of the system . . . This circumstance makes it diﬃcult to say whether Nicod’s theory of deduction is in 
fact constructed out of the single primitive term: ‘ |’. 
In 1921 I realized that a system of the theory of deduction containing deﬁnitions would actually be 
constructed from a single term only if the deﬁnitions were written down with just that primitive term 
and without recourse to a special equal-sign for deﬁnitions.” (1938b: 418) 

73 
be roughly characterized as dealing with predication. 
This chapter will be devoted to a historical presentation of the propositional con­
struction. Protothetic originated as the result of gradual axiomatic generalization of 
the propositional calculus. The ﬁrst propositional system (S) given by Le´sniewski is 
a purely equivalential propositional calculus without quantiﬁers. The second system 
(S1) admitted quantiﬁers binding propositional variables and also variables representing 
propositional connectives. Extending S1 with a certain rule (rule η) results in a stronger 
system S2. However, η was quite complicated, so it was replaced by another, simpler 
rule (called the rule of extensionality, η?). The result of this replacement is called S3. A 
conditional reformulation of S3 was called S4 and a slight equivalential modiﬁcation of 
S3 (deﬁnitions were written diﬀerently) was called S5. 
There are at least two diﬃculties in giving a historically adequate account of these 
systems. The ﬁrst one is that sources are sparse. Many important manuscripts have 
been destroyed during the Second World War. The systems are reconstructed mainly 
on the following basis: Tarski’s dissertation (Tarski 1923), the ﬁrst eleven paragraphs 
of Le´sniewski’s “Fundamentals of a New System of the Foundations of Mathematics” 
(Le´sniewski 1929a),5 and some lecture notes taken by his students, edited by Srzednicki 
and Stachniak (1988).6 
The second diﬃculty is that the standards of exposition that Le´sniewski followed 
were quite diﬀerent from what we are used to nowadays. That is, there is no explicit 
deﬁnition of a language, rules are sometimes described quite vaguely and sometimes only 
mentioned without explicit statement. 
5The twelfth paragraph being prepared for publication in 1938 survived as (Le´sniewski 1938b). 
6Before the notes were published, they were accessible to very few of Le´sniewski’s followers. One 
of them, J. S lupecki provided an impressive reconstruction Protothetic in his (1953). An unpublished 
PhD dissertation titled Computative Protothetic by Owen Le Blanc (1991) is an invaluable source of 
information about computative formulations of Protothetic (Le´sniewski (1938b) somewhat hints at the 
computative formulation). 

74 
I will begin with a brief account of the semantic categories insofar as this notion is 
useful for describing Le´sniewski’s systems. Next, I will devote some time to Le´sniewski’s 
notation of propositional connectives. Finally, I will present the six propositional calculi. 
3.2 Semantic categories 
The idea of segregating expressions of a given language according to the role they play 
in this language can be traced back to Aristotle (ﬁrst ﬁve chapters of On interpretation). 
A theory providing such a division has been developed in late medieval scholastic logic. 
In the modern era the ﬁrst philosopher to discuss this issue seems to have been Husserl. 
He outlined a sketch of the theory of Bedeutungskategorien (categories of meaning) in his 
Logical Investigations. 
The 
ﬁrst 
formalized 
version 
of 
this 
theory 
was 
constructed 
by 
Le´sniewski around 1921. The ﬁrst mention of this fact seems to be the second footnote 
of (Tarski 1923), but Le´sniewski published it in 1929a as an alternative to Russell’s and 
Whitehead’s theory of types. This study has been developed by Ajdukiewicz (1935), an­
other logician from the Lvov-Warsaw school. However, from the publication of “On syn­
tactic connectivity” (Ajdukiewicz 1935) onward, the subject of this theory was rather 
called ‘syntactic categories’. 
The underlying idea is that two expressions belong to the same semantic category 
if they are interchangeable in any sentence without the loss of meaningfulness, i.e. if 
one is replaced by another in a meaningful sentence, the resulting expression is also a 
meaningful sentence. 
In all of Le´sniewski’s systems there are two basic semantic categories. One of them 
is the category of names and the other one is the category of sentences. The intuition 
behind that is the notion of a name according to which a name is any expression (complex 

75 
or not) that may take the place of either M or N in a sentence of the form: ‘M is N’. 
This is quite straightforward in Latin or Polish which do not have articles. For example, 
all of the following are well-formed in Latin:7 
Canis est canis. 
Canis est animal. 
Socrates est animal. 
Chimera est animal. 
Chimera est Chimera. 
I will use the notion of semantic category with reference to formalized languages only. 
Beside expression of those two categories there are syncategorematic expressions 
which role is to construct more complex expressions when applied to some expressions. 
They are called functors. 8 
A piece of notation from Ajdukiewicz (1935), called index notation: 
Deﬁnition 1 (Semantic Category, index notation). Every propositional variable or 
propositional constant belongs to one class called the semantic category of sentences. 
If an expression belongs to this category, its index is s. Every name variable or name 
constant belongs to one category, called the semantic category of names. If an expression 
belongs to this category, its index is n. Every expression which neither has index s nor n 
is called a functor. What semantic category it belongs to is determined by (i) how many 
expressions it is applied to in order to construct a well-formed expression, (ii) what the 
7It is sometimes believed that in Latin ‘est’ has to occur as the last word in sentences like these. 
However plausible it is with respect to certain forms of ancient Latin, the rule does not apply to Medieval 
Latin, which was the language that logicians used to work in for centuries. The scholastic grammar 
allowed inﬁx notation for ‘est’ and I see no reason not to use scholastic Latin in contexts like the present 
one. 
8The term comes from Kotarbi´nski. 

| 
{z

76 
semantic categories of the expressions it is applied to are, and (iii) what the semantic 
category of the whole expression which it generates properly concatenated with its ar­
guments is. If a functor f applies to l arguments: α1, . . . , αl of categories (respectively) 
referred to by the following indexes: σ1, . . . , σl and yields an expression β of the semantic 
category denoted by σ, the index of the semantic category of f is the fraction: 
σ 
. 
σ1,...,σl 
Here is an example of how this works for the language of classical propositional logic: 
( p
( q
r ))

Expressions of (various systems of) Protothetic can be built from: propositional vari­
ables, sentence-forming functors of k sentence arguments (where either equivalence or 
implication is the only primitive connective, depending on the system), the universal 
quantiﬁer, any constant of any semantic category, which is correctly deﬁned in a given 
system by means of the formerly introduced symbols. Also, whenever a category has 
been introduced, variables can be introduced which belong to this category. 
If I were to give a more formal account (which Le´sniewski did not give), one of the 
ways to construct a language of Protothetic might be this: 
Deﬁnition 2. Expressions of Protothetic are constructed from: 
1. Propositional variables: p, q, r, possibly with numerical subscripts. They are of semantic 
category s. 
2. Functor variables: 
for any category τ constructed from s’s there are variables 
f τ , gτ , f1 
τ , f2 
τ , . . . , g1 
τ , g2 
τ , . . . of this category. 
3. One primitive propositional connective of category s : ≡. 
s,s 
4. The universal quantiﬁer: ∀. 

 
77 
5. For any category τ there are constants of this category c1 
τ , c2 
τ , . . ., deﬁned according to 
the rules of deﬁnition (to be introduced). 
The formation rules are: 
1. If φ is an expression of Protothetic of category 
τ 
and expressions of Protothetic 
σ1,...,σn 
α1, . . . , αn are respectively of categories σ1, . . . , σn, φ(α1, . . . , αn) is a well–formed ex­
pression of Protothetic of category τ. 
2. If χτ is a variable of category τ and φ is an expression of Prothetic of category s, then 
∀χτ φ is an expression of Protothetic of category s. 
A remark on Le´sniewski’s style. The problem is that the way Le´sniewski in­
troduced his language would be quite foreign to the modern reader. He did not specify 
the alphabet, he did not give the usual inductive deﬁnition of a well–formed formula. 
Therefore, the construction of the language of Protothetic that will follow does not fol­
low Le´sniewski. However, I believe that in the present context, the gain in readability 
outweighs the philosophical advantages to inscriptional syntax (employed by Le´sniewski). 
More on this topic in section 4.6. 
3.3 Le´sniewski’s notation 
Le´sniewski introduced his own idiosyncratic notation for one- and two-place sentential 
connectives. Its particular feature was that the shape of a symbol encoded its truth-table. 
In this section I will describe this notation due to its own merits, but later on I will use 
a modern notation for the sake of simplicity.9 
9In (Le´sniewski 1929a) his notation seems to have been used for the ﬁrst time, but, strictly speaking, 
Le´sniewski explains it in his (1938a). It is commented on in (Srzednicki and Stachniak 1988). Luschei 
(1962: 289–305) also devotes some space to this ideographic notation. 

78 
This is a preﬁx notation. Functors are written before arguments. Arguments are 
placed in parentheses and are not separated from each other by means of commas. 
Universal quantiﬁcation binding variables of any semantic category is expressed by 
the whole sequence of those variables put within the lower corner-brackets: b
c. For 
instance, a universal quantiﬁer binding all propositional variables: p1, . . . , pn is noted: 
bp1, . . . , pnc. The scope of a quantiﬁer is distinguished by upper-corner brackets: d e. 
For example, 
∀pp 
would be noted as: 
bpcdpe 
1- place Functors. The basic constituent of each 1-place functor symbol is a hor­
izontal line:‘−’. By adding to this line vertical lines on its ends (two such lines are 
possible) in all possible combinations we obtain all possible 1-place functors. The rules 
for this operations are simple:10 
• A vertical line occurs on the left side, iﬀ (if the argument has the value 0, the whole 
expression has the value 1). 
• A vertical line occurs on the right side, iﬀ (if the argument has the value 1, the 
whole expression has the value 1). 
Hence, we obtain four possible 1-place functors: a, `, `a, −, which can be described by 
the following classical matrix: 
10Le´sniewski himself was not committed to the existence of truth-values, and he did not speak about 
them. He did not provide any formal semantics for his systems at all. I do say things in terms of 
truth-values but it does not entail that I am committed to their existence. For the sake of presentation I 
just take it to be a convenient abbreviation to speak about ‘having truth value 0’ instead of ‘being false’ 
and ‘having truth value 1’ instead of ‘being true’.

The functor `a is called verum or the tautologous one argument connector. The functor 
− is called falsum. The functor ` is negation, and a — assertion. 
2- place Functors. The basis of a 2-place functor is a circle: ‘ b’ (called ‘the hub’). 
To this circle four possible lines (‘spokes’) can be added in four directions — up, down, 
left, right. The rules of adding these lines are as follows: 
• A line to the left occurs iﬀ for arguments having values respectively 1, 0, the whole 
expression has the value 1. 
• A line to the right occurs iﬀ for arguments having values respectively 0, 1, the 
whole expression has the value 1. 
• A line upwards occurs iﬀ for arguments of value 0, 0, the whole expression takes 
the value 1. 
• A line downwards occurs iﬀ for arguments of value 1, 1, whole expression takes 
value 1. 
These rules can be pictured by the following schema: 
0 0 
1 0 
 0 1 
1 1 
According to these rules we obtain 16 possible 2-place functors. To characterize them, 
we shall apply the following method: a 2-place functor will be characterized by a 4-place 

80 
sequence of elements 1 and 0, simply by giving values taken by the whole expression when 
arguments have values, respectively, 11, 10, 01, 00 (Names of functors are usually given 
according to Luschei’s translation (Luschei 1962: 290–291), with some slight diﬀerences).

A peculiar feature of this notation is that there is a correspondence between geometrical 
properties of symbols of functors and the logical properties of these functors. We shall 
not expand upon this subject. However, here are two examples: 

82 
1. Let us deﬁne the relation of inclusion between two functors: 
b(brscd b
D ⊂: 
bfhcd 
(f(rs)h(rs))e ⊂ (fh))e 
Notice ﬁrst that in Le´sniewski’s notation the deﬁniens comes ﬁrst and the deﬁnien­
dum occurs on the right side of the formula. As we can see, we have deﬁned the 
expression ⊂ of the category 
s 
s .
s 
ss ss 
That is, we deﬁne a connective, ⊂, which takes two two-place sentential connectives 
as arguments and yields a sentential expression as a result. The variables f, h 
represent sentential connectives, and r, s are propositional variables. In modern 
notation: 
∀f,h[f ⊂ h ≡∀r,s(r f s 
r h s)]
→ 
The inclusion of 1-place functors is deﬁned analogously (i.e. we should change the 
number of arguments of functors and the number of variables which the quantiﬁer 
binds). 
Now we can say: a functor h of the same number of arguments as f includes functor 
f iﬀ f is graphically a part (proper or not) of h. 
For example, the functor: b includes the functor b, because, for any r, s it is true, 
that 
if b(r, s) then b(r, s) 
We can make use of the deﬁned terminology by saying that two functors are equiv­
alent iﬀ they include each other. 
s 
ss
2. Deﬁne the functor cnv of the category 
by using the following deﬁnition: 
s 
ss 
D cnvhfi : 
bfrscd b(f(sr)cnvhfi(rs))e 
In the modern notation: 
∀f,r,s[cnv(f)(r, s) ≡ f(s, r)] 

 
83 
That is, applying cnv to a connective f yields a connective: cnv(f) which applied to 
two sentential argument yields truth-value 1 iﬀ f itself applied to those arguments 
but in reversed order yields truth value 1. 
We may say that g is a converse of f iﬀ g is equivalent to cnvhfi. The geometrical 
rule is: 
Two 2-place functors, say f, g are converses of each other iﬀ 
(a) f has a horizontal line on a given side iﬀ g has a horizontal line on 
the opposite side, and 
(b) f has a vertical line in a given direction iﬀ g also has a vertical line 
in the same direction. 
For example the following pairs are converses of each other: 
b, b; 
b, b; 
b, b 
This notation can be extended to connectives of more arguments (see Urbaniak 
2006b). 
3.4 Remarks on Protothetic 
Deﬁnition 3 (order of a functor). The order of a functor (connective) is deﬁned by two 
conditions: 
1. Every functor all arguments of which belong to the category of propositions is a ﬁrst-
order functor. 
2. Every functor at least one argument of which is of order k − 1 and no argument is of 
order k or higher, is an k-order functor. 

84 
First of all, a very important feature of Protothetic is that deﬁnitions are treated as 
expressions of this system, and equivalence is treated as the only primitive connective. 
For this reason, Le´sniewski’s account of deﬁnitions varies from that of Russell’s. Russell 
treated deﬁnitions as expressions of the meta–language which introduce abbreviations. 
Le´sniewski objected to this treatment on three counts: 
1. If a deﬁnition is to be an expression of the meta-language, then the meaning of 
‘iﬀ’s in deﬁnitions is more vague than it would have been otherwise. It is not 
sure whether it contributes anything to the system, allowing to generate new non­
equiform theorems, or whether rather it is just an unoﬃcial way of abbreviating 
theorems of the basic language of the system. It is not obvious (at least, if you are 
as picky as Le´sniewski was) whether such a deﬁnition is a kind of rule of inference, 
a notational rule or just an expression of the author’s state of mind. 
2. If having as simple a formulation as possible is an essential virtue of an axiomatic 
system (as Le´sniewski believed), it would be useful to be able to reduce deﬁnitions 
to something that you already have in the system anyway. 
3. As it turns out, some deﬁnitions in Le´sniewski’s systems are creative.11 That is, 
when you introduce a deﬁnition you may be able to prove something which does 
not contain the deﬁned term, but nevertheless would have been unprovable if you 
did not introduce it. But if you want to treat deﬁnitions only as meta-linguistic 
abbreviations, that is a situation you cannot have: abbreviating things should not 
change their ‘logical strength’. Some people believe that creativity of deﬁnitions is 
evil, some people do not. Le´sniewski belonged to the latter group. 
11(S lupecki 1955) contains a proof of this claim for Ontology, and (S lupecki 1953) mentions this prop­
erty of Protothetic. Generally the idea is that one can think of the language of Protothetic or Ontology as 
a higher–order language. Le´sniewski’s formulation did not contain an axiom of comprehension. Instead, 
it contained the rule that every formula of a certain form deﬁnes a new constant. A version of the axiom 
of comprehension was obtainable by existential instantiation after the introduction of a constant. Hence, 
for instance, in the formulations of Ontology which contain certain form of the axiom of comprehension, 
rules of deﬁnition are no longer creative (see Stachniak 1981). 

85 
Now, given that you want to formulate deﬁnitions within the system, what is the 
most suitable functor? Well, it is the equivalence. On the other hand, if you want to 
have as few functors as possible, it is far from clear that you can deﬁne all remaining 
connectives using equivalence. 
Actually, Le´sniewski’s criticism of Russell was a little bit more complex. Here is a 
brief story of it. Rumour12 has it that Le´sniewski devoted one of his Warsaw seminars 
to Principia Mathematica. It took him (the legend continues) one semester to read 
one page with his students. Indeed, a distinctive feature of Le´sniewski’s style is that 
he always very meticulously (and somewhat uncharitably) tried to reconstruct a view 
that he is about to criticize. To the best of my knowledge there is no written trace of 
the content of the famous seminar. However, when Le´sniewski started publishing his 
On the Foundations of Mathematics series, the ﬁrst chapter (included in his 1927 ) titled 
“On some questions regarding the sense of the ‘logistic’ theses” was devoted to a criticism 
of Principia Mathematica. 
Although Le´sniewski’s had his ﬁrst contact with something like modern formal logic 
already in 1911, it took him quite a few years to convince himself of the importance of 
symbolization for the development of logic and mathematics. The basic problem for him, 
it seems, was the lack of clarity as to the status of axioms and theorems of a given theory, 
to which the usual comments were no cure: 
The ﬁrst encounter with ‘symbolic logic’ created within me a strong aversion 
to that discipline for a number of years to come. Even the exposition of its 
elements included in the book by  Lukasiewicz, and certain other expositions of 
‘symbolic logic’ which I attempted in succession, wishing somehow to absorb 
the results reached by the exponents of this science were incomprehensible to 
12A story I heard from A.W. Mostowski in a discussion. I do not recall seeing the claim anywhere in 
print. 

86 
me, and not because of my own fault. . . Not possessing the faculty of entering 
into the spirit of other people’s ideas, I was estranged from the science itself 
by the considerable eﬀect of the obscure and ambiguous comments provided 
by its exponents. The decidedly sceptical dominant note of the position I 
occupied for a number of years in relation to ‘symbolic logic’ stemmed from 
the fact that I was not able to become conscious of the real ‘sense’ of the 
axioms and theorems of that theory — ‘of what’ and ‘what’, respectively, it 
was desired to ‘assert’ by means of the axioms and theorems. (Le´sniewski 
1927: 181–182) 
His criticism focused on the use of Russell’s assertion sign (‘`’) and the meaning assigned 
to logical constants in Principia Mathematica and Whitehead’s and Russell’s comments 
about those symbols. He opens his discussion with the following words: 
The character of the semantical doubts which occupied me for some time 
during attempts, long futile, to read the works written by ‘logicists’ can 
easily be grasped by anybody by a careful analysis of the comments which 
Whitehead and Russell provide for particular types of expressions which oc­
cur in the ‘theory of deduction’, and he may also reﬂect on such an occasion 
how much the aforesaid comments are infused with reﬁned cruelty towards 
a reader who is accustomed to paying some attention to anything he reads. 
(Le´sniewski 1927: 182) 
As an example, Le´sniewski considers ?1.3.: 
`: q. 
.p ∨ q
→ 
The comment one can ﬁnd in Principia Mathematica is: “This principle states: if q is 
true, then p or q is true”. To ﬁgure out why this is the right reading Le´sniewski tries to 

87 
ﬁnd in Principia Mathematica an explanation of the meaning of expressions of the types: 
` .p 
p ∨ q 
p
q
→ 
Turnstile. As for `, two comments that one can ﬁnd are: 
(3.1) 
“The sign ‘`’, called the ‘assertion-sign’ means that what follows is 
asserted. It is required for distinguishing a complete proposition, which we 
assert, from any subordinate propositions contained in it but not asserted.” 
(3.2) 
“In symbols, if ‘p’ is a proposition, ‘p’ by itself will stand for the 
unasserted proposition, while the asserted proposition will be designated by 
‘` .p’. The sign ‘`’ is called the assertion-sign; it may be read ‘it is true that’ 
(although philosophically this is not exactly what it means).” 
So, what is asserted by ‘` .p’? Passage (3.1) suggests that the propositions that are 
asserted are those that immediately follow the turnstile and a dot (so in this reading it 
is p itself that is asserted). This reading is also supported by the following: 
(3.3) “The dots after the assertion-signs, indicate its range; that is to say, 
everything following is asserted, until we reach either an equal number of 
dots, preceding a sign of implication or the end of the sentence.” 
On the other hand, passage (3.2) tells us that it is the whole expression ` .p that is 
asserted. This reading has also another textual support: 
(3.4) 
“On all occasions where, in Principia Mathematica, we have an 
asserted proposition of the form ‘` .fx’ or ‘` .fp’ this is not to be taken as 
meaning ‘` .(x).fx’ or ‘` .(p).fp’.” 

88 
As Le´sniewski puts it: 
After reading all the passages of the work which refer to the assertion sign and 
expressions of the type ‘` .p’ the reader who is not particularly distinguished 
by exuberant frivolity can hardly say that he understands the intentions of 
the authors. (Le´sniewski 1927: 183) 
Indeed, so far the only clear indication as to how to read ‘`’ in natural language is 
that one cannot read it as ‘it is true that’ without changing its meaning. 
In his attempt to clarify things, Le´sniewski formulates three questions: 
(i) Suppose ‘p’ is a proposition. Is ‘ ` .p’ also a proposition? 
(ii) Suppose ‘p’ is a proposition having a certain sense. Does ‘ ` .p’ have the same 
sense? 
(iii) What should we take to be Whitehead’s and Russell’s axioms and theorems? (a) 
Whole expressions (‘ ` .’ included) or (b) just those subexpressions which follow ‘ ` .’? 
Le´sniewski then discusses a few initially plausible readings of ‘`’ and their relation 
to the above questions. 
Reading A. ‘` .p’ means ‘we (Whitehead and Russell) assert that p’. The answer to 
question (i) is positive. The answer to question (ii) is negative. The answer to question 
(iii) is (a). 
The problem here is that on this reading the axioms and theorems express only the fact 
that the authors of the given theory assert this or that and are very speciﬁc statements 
about the authors of the theory. As Le´sniewski puts it: 
. . . a system created from that type of proposition, is not a system of logic at 
all; It could rather be considered as a deductive confession of the authors of 
the given theory. (Le´sniewski 1927: 187) 
Reading B. ‘` .p’ means ‘that which follows is asserted: p’. On this view, according 

89 
to Le´sniewski, the answer to question (i) is negative: 
that which follows, is asserted: p 
for him is not a proposition, but rather “a peculiar composite of three parts following 
one after another, of which the ﬁrst, the assertion sign, is a proposition in the form 
of a single expression having the same sense as the proposition “that which follows is 
asserted”, the second is formed of dots, and the third, the expression ‘p’ is a proposition, 
as we assumed.” (Le´sniewski 1927: 185) Thus, the complex expression which is not a 
proposition does not have the same sense as its constituent proposition and the answer 
to question (iii) on this reading is (b). 
Le´sniewski points out that if this is how one should read ‘`’, it seems that Whitehead 
and Russell are not using the symbol consistently, for they sometimes put it in front of a 
formula which they certainly do not want to assert. For instance we can ﬁnd in Principia 
Mathematica statements like: 13 
Similarly `: (y) : (∃x).f(x, y). 
Reading C. ‘` .p’ has the same meaning as ‘p’. The authors just put ‘`’ in front of 
a proposition just to suggest that it is a proposition which they are asserting (but the 
assertion is not part of the content of a proposition). We should count as axioms whole 
expressions, ‘`’ included. 
Here, Le´sniewski suggests that the same objection that he put forward against reading 
(B), mutatis mutandis, applies here. 
Use of variables and semantic ascent. Continuing his elaboration of ?1.3. 
Le´sniewski notices that according to ?1.01. implication ‘p
q’ is deﬁned by ‘ p ∨ q’,
→
¬
where deﬁnitions are supposed to preserve the meaning. Thus he takes ?1.3. to mean 
the same as: 
13Le´sniewski refers to p. XXIV of the ﬁrst volume of the 1910 edition of Principia Mathematica. 

90 
(3.5) 
‘ q. ∨ .p ∨ r’ 
¬
Now the question is how we should understand the negation. The explanation to be 
found in Principia Mathematica is: 
If p is any proposition, the proposition ‘not p’ or ‘p is false’, will be represented 
by ‘ p’.
¬
Thus it seems that according to Whitehead and Russell reading ‘ p’ as either ‘not p’ 
¬
or ‘p is false’ does not change the meaning of what is claimed. This is problematic for 
Le´sniewski, because in ‘p is false’, the symbol p no longer represents a proposition the 
way it does in ‘ p’. When we say ‘ . . . is false’, the dots should be ﬁlled by a name
¬
of a sentence (or proposition), not by the sentence itself. For instance the expression 
‘Spiderman is bald is false’ is not a well-formed sentence. Rather, it has to say something 
about the sentence, as in 
‘Spiderman is bald’ is false. 
That being the case, the sentence:14 
‘p’ is false 
does not mean the same as ‘ p’. They may be equivalent, perhaps, but the former 
¬
says something about a linguistic expression. The latter does not have to do that. The 
expression: ‘not: Spiderman is bald’ is not a sentence about a sentence: it is about 
Spiderman and his baldness (if you will), but it does not contain a name that refers to a 
sentence. 
Similarly, Whitehead and Russell explain the meaning of disjunction: 
If p and q are any propositions, the proposition ‘p or q’, i.e. ‘either p is true 
or q is true’ where the alternatives are to be not mutually exclusive, will be 
represented by ‘p ∨ q’. 
14I put aside the worries about variables occurring in quotations. 

91 
But then (3.5) means the same as: 
(3.6) 
‘ ‘q’ is false’ is true or ‘p or r’ is true. 
which expands to: 
(3.7) 
‘q is false’ is true or ‘ ‘p’ is true or ‘r’ is true’ is true. 
Again, ‘or’ occurs in the above, and since it is taken to mean the same as ‘∨’ we can 
easily climb the ladder of semantic ascent, allegedly preserving the meaning of the whole 
sentence: 
(3.8) 
‘ ‘q’ is false’ is true or either ‘ ‘p’ is true’ is true or ‘ ‘r’ is true’ is true. 
Quite correctly, however, Le´sniewski points out that semantic ascent does not preserve 
the meaning. Propositions that mean the same are about the same. But, for instance, 
‘Paris is in France’ is a sentence about Paris and its location, whereas ‘ ‘Paris is in 
France’ is true’ is about a sentence and its relation to the world. 
In a few words. Indeed, Whitehead and Russell were not perfectly clear or consistent 
in their use of ‘`’ or propositional connectives. Nor were they very careful when they 
explained the classical connectives in terms of semantic ascent. On the other hand, 
Le´sniewski’s criticism does not seem as crippling as he himself (quite uncharitably) took 
it to be: 
. . . the reader will constantly wilt under the weight of this medley of inter­
pretations. The impenetrable chaos which is the actual result of the reader’s 
eﬀort aimed at grasping the sense of the ‘primitive proposition’ ?1.3., could 
be even intensiﬁed, if the reader refers to a series of other comments contained 
in the work of Whitehead and Russell and connected with the comments on 
the mentioned problems, which do not harmonize with the authors’ comments 
already quoted or even with one another. (Le´sniewski 1927: 194) 

92 
Still, Le´sniewski’s suggestion was that one should ignore the assertion sign (not be­
cause it is superﬂuous but rather because it muddles things) and avoid any kind of 
treatment of complex formulas which takes them to be saying something about their 
constitutive formulas. 
3.5 Axiomatic formulations 
What follows is a simpliﬁcation of the original account. The main issue here is that 
Le´sniewski was a nominalist, and his directives were not directives describing some ab­
stract entity (say, a set of theorems), but rather a description of how a system seen 
as a bunch of inscriptions is to be developed. For, indeed, his view on logical systems 
was quite dynamic: theorems are written expressions, and the system physically grows 
or develops as new theorems and proofs are being written down. This speciﬁc feature 
was mirrored in Le´sniewski’s explanation of his systems: he was really concerned with 
speaking of his system as if it were a set of inscriptions. So, for instance, depending on 
in what stage of the development the system is, some expressions may be meaningful or 
meaningless according to whether their deﬁnitions have been already written, etc. For 
the sake of simplicity of our description I will not follow this style, thus presenting a 
somewhat ‘Platonized’ version of Protothetic. 
A few words about notational conventions. Variables p, q, r are propositional variables 
within the system, variables f, g are variables of categories diﬀerent than s (the context 
will determine their category). φ, ψ, χ are meta–linguistic variables standing for formu­
las, ζ (possibly with subscripts) are schematic meta–variables representing variables of 
categories diﬀerent from the category of sentences and τ is a schematic letter standing 
for a constant (i.e. a propositional constant or a functor of certain category other than 
the category of sentences).15 
15At one point, (ζ) is a name of a rule, but the context should make it clear. 

93 
System S. As discussed in (Le´sniewski 1929a: 423–438) it had two axioms: 
((p ≡ r) ≡ (q ≡ p)) ≡ (r ≡ q) 
(p ≡ (q ≡ r)) ≡ ((p ≡ q) ≡ r) 
and two rules: 
— From ψ ≡ χ and ψ infer χ (called detachment for equivalence). 
— From ψ ≡ χ and φ infer φ(χ) which is a result of replacing some of occurrences of 
ψ in φ by χ (called substitution for equivalence). 
The system is not functionally complete, but it has an interesting feature: for any 
expression φ in the language of this system (that is, correctly constructed from propo­
sitional variables and the equivalence symbol) this expression is a theorem of S iﬀ any 
propositional variable in φ occurs an even number of times.16 
System S1. This system (Le´sniewski 1929a: 438–450) admitted quantiﬁers binding 
propositional variables and ﬁrst-order functors. There were three axioms: 
∀p,q,r(((p ≡ r) ≡ (q ≡ p)) ≡ (r ≡ q)) 
∀p,q,r((p ≡ (q ≡ r)) ≡ ((p ≡ q) ≡ r)) 
∀g,p(∀f (g(p, p) ≡∀r((f(r, r) ≡ g(p, p)) ≡∀r(f(r, r) ≡ 
≡ g(p ≡∀qq, p))) ≡∀qg(p, p))) 
Tarski (1923) has shown that the system is functionally complete. 
It is common in the literature to call quantiﬁers binding propositional variables only 
ﬁrst-order protothetical quantiﬁers, and to call other quantiﬁers higher order prototheti­
cal quantiﬁers. Note that ﬁrst order propositional quantiﬁcation alone would not suﬃce 
16This seems to be the ﬁrst form of the so-called Le´sniewski-Mihailescu theorem. 

94 
to deﬁne all truth–functional connectives using equivalence as the sole primitive connec­
tive (see Surma 1977 for details). It only allows one to deﬁne two propositional constants: 
false (∀pp) and true (∀p(p ≡ p)), and four functions of one argument: assertion (p), nega­
tion (∀pp ≡ p), the verum of p (p ≡ p) and the falsum of p (∀p(p ≡ p)) but this does not 
constitute functional completeness. The deﬁnition of conjunction requires higher-order 
protothetical quantiﬁcation: 
p ∧ q ≡∀f (p ≡ (f(p) ≡ f(q))) 
(3.9) 
Having deﬁned negation (using ﬁrst–order quantiﬁcation) and conjunction (using higher– 
order quantiﬁcation) this way Tarski was able to obtain the functional completeness 
result. 
S1 had six rules: 
(α) detachment for equivalence. 
(β) substitution: this works almost like universal quantiﬁer elimination in natural 
deduction systems. From ∀ζ φ it allows one to infer the expression resulting from sub­
stituting in φ all occurrences of ζ (free in φ) by a simple expression of the language 
(constants, variables) given that no substituted variable becomes bound. Strictly speak­
ing, no complex expression can be used in a substitution. However, one can get the same 
result as if complex expressions could be used, introducing simple expressions ‘equiva­
lent’ to the complex expression by means of deﬁnitions. This rule applies to propositional 
variables and functor variables as well. 
(γ) Let all free variables in χ be p1, . . . , pk, and let all free variables in ψ be pk+1, . . . , pm. 
From ∀p1,...,pm (χ ≡ ψ) infer ∀p1,...,pk χ ≡∀pk+1,...,pm ψ. An analogous rule pertains to uni­
versal quantiﬁers binding functor variables (distribution). 
(δ) τ ≡ χ is a deﬁnition of a newly introduced propositional constant τ iﬀ χ is a 
well-formed formula with no free variables (absolute deﬁnitions). 

95 
() ∀ζ1,...,ζn (τ(ζ1, . . . , ζn) ≡ χ(ζ1, . . . , ζn)) is a deﬁnition of a newly introduced n-place 
functor τ, iﬀ ζ1, . . . , ζn are the only free variables in the wﬀ χ(ζ1, . . . , ζn) (non-primitive 
expressions cannot occur in wﬀs unless they are earlier deﬁned). 
(ζ) a rule concerning quantiﬁers. Originally it was formulated for a language with 
implication as the primitive symbol. No clear description of this rule exists in the sources. 
It was supposed to move universal quantiﬁer from the front of a conditional to the front 
of the consequent, given that no variable bound by this quantiﬁer occurred as free in the 
antecedent. What we know is that Tarski in 1922 proved it to be dependent on the other 
rules and as such redundant (so we do not need it anyway). (Srzednicki and Stachniak 
1988: 22–23)) 
System S2. Described in (Le´sniewski 1929a: 451–53), it is an extension of S1 by a rule 
called (η). This rule originates from an idea due to  Lukasiewicz, which goes as follows: 
Two propositional constants are introduced: 
0 ≡∀qq 
1 ≡ (∀qq ≡∀qq) 
Whenever for a formula φ all possible substitutions of propositional variables in φ by 
0’s and 1’s are sentences provable in S1, the sentence constructed from the formula φ 
by binding all free propositional variables in φ by universal quantiﬁers preceding φ is a 
theorem. Le´sniewski introduced an analogous rule for semantic categories other than s. 
So, simplifying, for any semantic category σ there is a speciﬁc set of constants S 
(called veriﬁers) such that for any formula φ if all results of substitution of free variables 
of the category σ by elements of S are provable in S1, then the formula φ preceded by 
universal quantiﬁers binding these variables is a theorem of S2. 
For instance, for the semantic category s, the propositional constants would have 
s
been 1 and 0, as deﬁned above. For the category s,s , they are all 16 truth-functional 

96 
connectives. In general the veriﬁers of a given semantic category are all (up to logical 
equivalence) diﬀerently deﬁned constants of that category. Le´sniewski provided a detailed 
explanation of what a veriﬁer is. For the purpose of this historic survey, the intuitive 
content of the rule should be suﬃcient. 
Le´sniewski did not want rule η to allow the introduction of universal quantiﬁers 
binding propositional variables. So, in his formulation, the rule (i) describes the form of 
all veriﬁers of a certain category other than s (basically, the deﬁnientes of all extensional 
constants of that category respectively) and (ii) allows one to introduce ∀ζ φ(ζ) if all 
instances resulting from the substitution of veriﬁers of the same category as ζ for ζ in 
φ(ζ) have been proven. A likely reason why this rule excluded the case of a universal 
quantiﬁer binding a propositional variable is that this would make the rule partially 
redundant. Other rules handle quantiﬁers binding propositional variables suﬃciently, 
i.e. if an expression can be proved by applying η to propositional variables, then it was 
already provable in S1. 
System S3. (Le´sniewski 1929a: 454–464) arose from the fact that the formulation 
of (η) requires quite a complicated technical apparatus (determining what the set of 
relevant constants for each semantic category is). Thus, Le´sniewski proposed a rule of 
extensionality, called (η?) which turns out to do the same job as (η). The rule says that 
for any one-place functor of at least second order the corresponding law of extensionality 
(to be deﬁned below) is a theorem. 
To formulate the law of extensionality for higher-order functors we have to deﬁne 
their equivalence ﬁrst. 
Deﬁnition 4 (Higher-order Equivalence). The ﬁrst-order equivalence of sentential con­
nectives is deﬁned by: 
. 
∀f,g,p1,...,pk ((f = g) ≡ (f(p1, . . . , pk) ≡ g(p1, . . . , pl))) 

97 
Diﬀerent kinds of equivalence between expressions of the same category σ are deﬁned 
according to the following schema: 
. σ 
.
(χ1 = χ2) ≡∀ξ1,...,ξn (φ(ξ1, . . . , ξn) = ψ(ξ1, . . . , ξn)) 
where χ1 and χ2 are constants of a certain category 
σ0 
and ξ1, . . . , ξn are variables 
σ1,...,σn 
of categories (respectively) σ1, . . . , σn. Also, the propositional equivalence ≡ is taken to 
.
be a degenerate case of =, so the schema covers also the cases where σ0 is s. That is, two 
functors are equivalent iﬀ the results of applying them to the same arguments results in 
equivalent expressions. 
Now, the rule of extensionality says that any instance of the following: 
. σ 
. σ 
∀ζ1,ζ2,ζ [(ζ1 = ζ2)
(ζ(ζ1) = ζ(ζ2))]
→ 
is a theorem, where ζ1, ζ2 are variables of the category σ and ζ is a functor of the category 
σ of at least second order. This reads: if two expressions ζ1 and ζ2 are equivalent, then 
σ,σ 
for any one-place functor ζ of at least second order, the result of applying ζ to ζ1 is 
equivalent to the result of applying it to ζ2. Thus, S3 employs the same axioms as S1, 
and the rules: (α), (β), (γ), (δ), () and (η?). 
System S4. This system, introduced in (Le´sniewski 1929a: 456–459)17 is a conditional 
formulation of S3 and is based on the following axioms: 
∀p,q(p 
(q
p)) 
(3.10)
→
→ 
∀p,q,r((p
q) 
((q
r)
(p
r))) 
(3.11)
→
→ 
→
→
→ 
∀p,q,r(((p
q) 
r) 
((p
r) 
r)) 
(3.12)
→
→
→ 
→
→ 
∀g,p,q(g(p, q)
(g(p →∀qq, p) 
g(q, p))) 
(3.13)
→
→ 
17There, Le´sniewski described his formulation from year 1922. 

98 
The last axiom is quite interesting. Let us see what it says and why it is valid. It 
states that for any two–place connective g, if g(p, q) is true and g(p →∀qq, p) (that 
is, g( p, p), because ∀qq is disprovable) is true, then also g(q, p) is true. Why? Well, 
¬
Protothetic is a two–valued extensional logic. Hence, under any valuation q has to be 
either (materially) equivalent to p or to p. If it has the same truth–value as p, then 
¬ 
¬
we can substitute q for 
p in g( p, p) and hence g(q, p). If, on the other hand, q has
¬
¬
the same truth value as p, we can substitute p for q in g(p, q) and so we get g(p, p). But 
then, we also can substitute q for p and we get g(q, p) as well. 
The rules of system S4 were: 
• (α1) From φ → ψ and φ infer ψ (detachment for implication). 
• (β1) substitution rule. 
• (γ1) Distribution of universal quantiﬁer over conditionals (an intuitive correlate of 
(γ)).18 
• (δ1), (1), which describe what the deﬁnitions should look like. The only way 
these rules diﬀer from (δ) and () is that the equivalence symbol cannot occur in 
deﬁnitions. The only propositional connective which can be used is the implication 
sign, so instead of: 
φ ≡ ψ 
deﬁnitions employ: 
∀σ(((φ
ψ) 
((ψ
φ) 
σ)) 
σ)
→
→ 
→
→
→ 
where σ is a propositional variable which is free neither in φ nor in ψ. 
• (ζ1) which is a conditional formulation of (ζ). 
18Let all free variables in χ be p1, . . . , pk, and let all free variables in ψ be pk+1, . . . , pm. From 
∀p1,...,pm (χ
ψ) infer ∀p1,...,pk χ →∀pk+1,...,pm ψ. Similarly for quantiﬁers binding variables of other 
categories. 
→ 

99 
• (η1) or (η1?) which are conditional formulations of (η) and (η?). 
Later (1922–1923), this system was simpliﬁed. The ﬁrst important simpliﬁcation is 
due to Tarski (see Le´sniewski 1929a: 459), who (i) suggested writing deﬁnitions in the 
form of two separate implications, and (ii) showed that it will suﬃce to use (3.10) and 
the following axiom of veriﬁcation instead of all the above axioms: 
∀f,p,q,r(f(r, p)
(f(r, p →∀ss) 
f(r, q)))
→
→ 
System S5 
is the ﬁnal form of Protothetic. It is a slight modiﬁcation of the rule of 
deﬁnition: deﬁnienda are placed on the right side of the equivalence and not on the left) 
and uses the same rules as S3. The diﬀerence is that it makes proofs shorter, because 
it allows one to apply universal quantiﬁer distribution and detachment to deﬁnitions 
without employing the theorem stating that equivalence is symmetric. 
3.6 (Annotated) further readings 
Historically speaking, Protothetic was preceded by certain suggestions concerning propo­
sitional quantiﬁcation. Russell (1906) suggested introducing quantiﬁers binding the 
propositional variables, but he did not use this idea.  Lukasiewicz (1929) developed a 
calculus where quantiﬁers binding propositional variables play an important part (see 
also  Lukasiewicz and Tarski 1930), but it seems that the generality that Protothetic can 
aﬀord was Le´sniewski’s idea. The very ﬁrst paper related to Protothetic which employs 
quantiﬁcation not only over propositional variables but also over variables representing 
connectives is Tarski (1923, reprinted in Srzednicki and Stachniak 1998), where it was 
shown that when this sort of generality is admitted, conjunction can be deﬁned in terms of 
equivalence as the only connective. Tarski’s results on functional completeness of Proto­
thetic were extended by Soboci´nski (1949a, reprinted in Srzednicki and Stachniak 1998), 
who generalized Tarski’s considerations concerning forms of deﬁnitions in Protothetic. 

100 
Soboci´nski’s paper is also interesting for historical reasons — in the introduction he de­
scribes the fate of Collectanea Logica, the Polish journal in which (Le´sniewski 1938a,b) 
were to appear. The outbreak of war made its publication impossible. 
The project of ﬁnding the shortest possible axiomatization of Protothetic, already 
initiated by Le´sniewski, was continued not only by him but also by some of his students 
for quite a few years. 
Soboci´nski (1954b, 1960, 1961) are good surveys of the results. The latter paper also 
contains an interesting metatheorem which states a suﬃcient condition for an axiomati­
zation of Protothetic (although no proof is given). Soboci´nski also gave another, slightly 
more complicated version of suﬃcient conditions for completeness, also without a proof 
(with some explanation, though). Le Blanc (1985) provides another, shorter version of 
the axiomatization. 
One of the best introductions to Protothetic so far is S lupecki (1953). The formula­
tions that S lupecki focuses on are mainly conditional. His explanations of the rules of 
inference are somewhat vague, but he provides many examples of simple proofs which 
allow the reader to get an idea as to what rules he is using. In one aspect his rules dif­
fer from those of Le´sniewski: he allows for substitution of complex expressions in place 
of variables of appropriate semantic categories, which was forbidden in the original for­
mulation — this move, however, is conservative. S lupecki does not prove this in whole 
generality, but gives a convincing argument. A nice feature of S lupecki’s presentation is 
that he starts with relatively simple systems and goes on to construct full Protothetic 
by gradual strengthening. He ﬁrst gives propositional calculus with quantiﬁers binding 
propositional connectives only. Another nice feature of the conditional formulation is 
that ﬁrst-order quantiﬁcation is suﬃcient for deﬁning negation, and the conditional and 
negation provide a functionally complete basis. The disadvantage is that in the oﬃcial 

101 
notation deﬁnitions have the form of two separate conditionals.19 So, for example, the 
deﬁnition of negation is: 
∀p(¬p → (p →∀pp)) 
(3.14) 
∀p((p →∀pp) →¬p) 
(3.15) 
Next, he discussed some interesting theorems that can be formulated in elementary Pro­
tothetic, which he also proved to be provably equivalent in elementary Protothetic (for 
one-place function symbols, at least, but a generalization of his results is to be found by 
Chikawa (1967)). He proved that for any theorem of the classical propositional calcu­
lus the formula constructed by binding all the free variables in the formula by universal 
quantiﬁers preceding the whole formula is a theorem of elementary Protothetic. The 
ﬁrst extension of elementary Protothetic to the full-blown Protothetic that he discusses 
employs the rule of veriﬁcation. Basically, it consists in deﬁning what the appropriate 
substitution class for universal quantiﬁers of any semantic category is and saying that 
if all substitutions of a universal claim are provable, the universal claim itself is prov­
able. This formulation has the advantage that the completeness proof is relatively simple. 
Another extension of elementary Protothetic consists in introducing the so-called rule of 
extensionality, which is also discussed by S lupecki. He states the equivalence of those two 
systems, although his meta-logical proofs are very sketchy. A sketch of a completeness 
proof is included, but it is not obviously convincing. 
Rickey (1972, (1973), provides a really good insight into the nature of Le´sniewski’s 
terminological explanations, with special attention to how inscriptional description of the 
rules of Protothetic is to be understood. 
An interesting book (in French), intended as an introduction to Protothetic, is 
(Mi´eville 2001). This book certainly does a better job than (Luschei 1962), the pre­
19This formulation resembles the conditional formulation of Protothetic given by Le´sniewski. The main 
diﬀerence is that in Le´sniewski’s conditional formulation deﬁnitions had the form of a single, although 
slightly complex, formula. 

102 
sentation is quite relaxed, though. 
Le´sniewski’s idiosyncratic wheel-and-spoke notation is interesting for at least two rea­
sons: (i) symbols for propositional one- and two-place connectives encode their truth-
tables with their own shape, (ii) geometric relations between diﬀerent symbols correspond 
to various logical relations between the functions that they express. Recently it has been 
shown that there is a simple algorithm that extends this method to arbitrary ﬁrst-order 
classical connectives (Urbaniak 2006b). 
A comprehensive monograph on Protothetic has been published recently 
(L´opez-Escobar and Miraglia 2002), but it is mostly concerned with constructing in­
tuitionist Protothetic. 
Another group of formulations of Protothetic, hinted at by Le´sniewski, is called com­
putative Protothetic and was the subject of a PhD thesis at the University of Manchester 
(Le Blanc 1991). In the system there are signs for assertion and rejection, and rules per­
tain to which formulas are asserted or rejected on the basis of what has been previously 
asserted or rejected. The oldest system of computative Protothetic has as its axiom: 
A : Λ 
Λ 
(3.16)
→ 
where Λ is the falsum constant and A means assertion, and contained nine rules of 
inference. Le Blanc describes sixteen equivalent formulations, based on ten diﬀerent 
combinations of primitive terms. He reconstructs those systems and provides a detailed 
description of their rules. Also, arguments for consistency, completeness and equivalence 
with the standard systems of Protothetic are given. However, these are not detailed and 
complete proofs. 
An interesting research direction is many-valued Protothetics. They have been studied 
(and a completeness result has been given) by Scharle (1971). It turns out that ﬁnitely-
valued Protothetic can be axiomatized with the following property: for every closed wﬀ 

103 
φ one of Ji(φ) is provable, where Ji is a function that takes one of the designated values 
only if its argument has value i. The full proof of this fact can be given using a technique 
developed in Surma (1976) which uses ﬁnitely generated trees. Many-valued Protothetics 
have been the subject of a PhD dissertation at the University of Manchester, supervised 
by Lejewski (Watanabe 1973). As Watanabe has shown, the change in the number of 
admissible values results in the possibility of introducing diﬀerent general quantiﬁers of 
one and the same semantic category, corresponding to diﬀerent conjunctions one can 
introduce in a many-valued system. 
There is a connection between Protothetic and Henkin’s theory of propositional 
types (Henkin 1950, 1963), which was an improvement of the system of Church (1940). 
(Andrews (1963) constitutes an improvement of Henkin’s theory). Minor details aside, 
Henkin’s theory of propositional types can be thought of as a version of Protothetic. 
Grzegorczyk (1964) shows that every one of Henkin’s equality symbols is deﬁnable by 
mean of relational abstraction and the equality symbol for the usual material equivalence 
(although still the set of axioms is denumerable). Meredith (1951) provides also a similar 
system, commented on by Arai and Tanaka (1966). 
Propositional calculi become more complex when we admit non-extensional operators. 
One of the intuitive steps is to introduce an identity operator which expresses something 
like ‘expresses the same proposition’ or ‘states the same fact’. If the criteria of identity 
are more ﬁne-grained than in Frege’s account (according to which the denotation of any 
two sentences having the same truth value is the same), we get non-extensional calculi. 
Zero-order calculi with additional axioms and rules for identity, called Sentential Calculi 
with Identity (SCI), have been extensively studied by Suszko (1966, 1967, 1971f,e,d,b,a,c, 
1972b,a, 1973, 1975, 1977) and developed by Omy la (1994). Apparently quite indepen­
dently, following a suggestion of Prior (1957), Cresswell constructed a second-order the­
ory of intensional identity. Besides the diﬀerence of level, in Suszko’s system identity is 

104 
a primitive symbol introduced axiomatically, whereas in Cresswell’s system identity is 
deﬁned by: 
p = q ≡∀f (f(p) ≡ f(q)) 
(3.17) 
where functorial variables are allowed to range over non-extensional functors as well. 
The question of the relation between Cresswell’s and Suszko’s systems has not been fully 
explored. Also, Suszko at one point suggests that Protothetic would have been much more 
interesting if it had admitted the intensional identity. No such extension of Protothetic 
has been constructed so far. Another fascinating issue seems to be the relation between 
intensional identity and modalities. In his papers Suszko also shows how in some systems 
with identity as the only primitive non-extensional system it is possible to obtain various 
modal calculi. 

Chapter 4 
Le´sniewski’s Ontology 
4.1 Ontology — basic intuitions 
The ﬁrst remark on Ontology, a logical system developed by Le´sniewski, dates back to his 
introduction to “On the Foundations of Mathematics”. It is a second layer of his systems. 
The ﬁrst layer, Protothetic, consisted of a logic concerned mostly with propositional 
variables. The second layer extends this by introducing a category of names (and other 
derivative categories) and a predication operator: ε. Without describing the system he 
says that Ontology. . . 
. . . forms a certain kind of modernized ‘traditional logic’, and which in content 
and ‘power’ most nearly approaches the Schr¨oder ‘Klassenkalk¨ul’, considered 
as including the theory of ‘individuals’. (1927: 176) 
The ﬁrst axiomatization of Ontology1 Le´sniewski claims to have formulated while 
teaching a course ‘Exercises in the domain of the Cantorian Theory of Sets’ at Warsaw 
University in 1919/1920 (1931a: 367). 
The ﬁrst oﬃcial presentation of Ontology was Le´sniewski’s lecture in Warsaw on 
January 10, 1921, titled ‘On the principles of Ontology’ at the scientiﬁc session of the 
Polish Association for Psychology (1931a: 369). 
Ontology, a theory more general that Protothetic, is mostly concerned with predica­
tion, but it diﬀers from the classical ﬁrst order logic in a few respects. 
1All other formulations of Ontology consist in replacing the axiom of Ontology with another, provably 
equivalent axiom or axioms. 
105 

106 
First of all, it introduces terms, but it makes no distinction between names and 
predicates. In this respect, it follows the traditional syllogistic rather than the predicate 
calculus. That is, it assumes only one category of names, no matter whether they are 
empty, singular or common. So, a wide understanding of the word name is accepted 
here. A name is any expression that may take the place of either M or N in a sentence 
of the form: M is N. Or, in other words, all countable categorematic (as opposed 
to syncategorematic) expressions that are not sentences are taken to be names. Some 
examples of names in this wide understanding are: (a) cat, Socrates, brown, the bald guy 
in the corner. 
Le´sniewski’s Ontology can be viewed as an extension of name calculus in the wide 
sense of the word ‘name’ mentioned above. That is, the speciﬁc variables (a, b, c, d, . . .) 
that are used in Ontology are name variables.2 It can be thought of as an extension 
because it also allows for variables of higher categories which involve categories of names. 
One of the possible ways to think of name variables is that they correspond to possible 
countable noun phrases. Another way, slightly more in Le´sniewski’s spirit, is that they 
represent ways in which a name can refer. 
Referring to nothing at all is also a way in which a name can refer. In fact, names that 
are represented by variables may be empty names (Unicorn), singular terms (Socrates), 
or general terms ((all) cats). Thus, by including the case when a name does not refer, 
Le´sniewski’s logic, in a sense, is one of the very ﬁrst formalized free logics. 
A second respect in which Ontology diﬀers from standard ﬁrst–order logic is that it 
represents predication in a diﬀerent way than ﬁrst order languages. Besides quantiﬁers3 
and classical propositional connectives, Ontology has another primitive symbol, the ep­
silon connective ε (read as ‘is’ or ‘is one of’). An expression of the form a ε b is read as ‘a is 
2It does not mean that no variables of other categories are not used. It just means that the intro­
duction of name variables is one of the most characteristic feature of Ontology. 
3Historically speaking, Le´sniewski used only the universal quantiﬁer. 

107 
b’ (‘a is one of b’s’) and it is true if and only if a is taken to be a singular term that names 
an object which is among the objects named by b. So, the following are true: Socrates 
ε philosopher, The book on my desk ε Kleene’s ‘Introduction to Metamathematics’, and 
the following turn out to be false (although still well-formed): Unicorn ε animal, ele­
phant ε animal. Some examples of the rendering of simple quantiﬁed statements: ‘some 
philosophers are mad’ (‘some b is c’) has the form ∃a(a ε b ∧ a ε c) and ‘all mad people 
think they are philosophers’ (‘all b are c’) becomes something like ∀a(a ε b → a ε c).4 
Third, in Ontology quantiﬁers do not carry ontological commitment. It is the use of 
ε by which existence is stated. So, existence is deﬁned: 
∀a(ex(a) ≡∃bb ε a) 
(4.1) 
and it is provable in Ontology that for some a, a does not exist: 
∃a¬ex(a) 
(4.2) 
This and similar facts raised a fairly complex debate about the interpretation of 
Le´sniewski’s quantiﬁers and the meaning of variables in his systems. I list related liter­
ature in section 4.7, and I discuss the problem of interpretation of quantiﬁers in more 
depth in chapter 7. 
4.2 The language of Ontology 
The notion of semantic category as applied to Ontology is the notion that we already 
know from section 3.2. What is new in comparison to Protothetic, expressions of the 
category n of names are introduced, and expressions of categories that can be built from 
4However, it is possible that natural language quantiﬁcation is ambiguous. So, for example, a universal 
statement with existential import should be rather rendered as ‘∀a(a ε b → a ε c) ∧∃cc ε a. 

108 
s’s and n’s are allowed, pretty much as in Protothetic we allowed categories built from 
s’s only (see deﬁnition 1 on page 75). 
All formulas of type a ε b are of category s. All terms are of category n. Any expression 
which with n arguments of categories σ1, . . . , σn yields an expression of the category σ is 
σ
of category σ1,...,σn . For instance, ε takes two arguments, both of category n and forms 
s
an expression of category s. Thus, its category is nn . 
The language of Ontology arises from a generalization parallel to that of Protothetic: 
for any semantic category of Ontology, constants can be deﬁned, and variables together 
with quantiﬁers binding those variables can be introduced. 
Deﬁnition 5. Ontology is constructed in a language determined by the following:5 
1. a, b, c, d, e, possibly with subscripts are nominal variables, of category n. 
2. The language of Protothetic is a sub–language of the language of Ontology. That is, any 
formation rule that holds for Protothetic, hold also for Ontology and every well–formed 
formula of Protothetic is a well–formed formula of Ontology. 
s
3. ε is a primitive symbol of category nn . 
4. For any deﬁned constant6 of category 
τ 
(rules of deﬁnitions are given below),7there
σ1···σn 
τ
τ 
also are variables of that category, f σ1···σn , g σ1···σn , possibly with subscripts. In practice, 
the superscripts are omitted when the semantic category is obvious from the context.8 
5This is not exactly the language that Le´sniewski used, but (granted the slightly Platonic approach) it 
has all the properties essential for the further development. Section 4.6 is devoted to a brief explanation 
of the speciﬁc aspects of Le´sniewski’s meta–logic. 
6Any new expression introduced by means of a deﬁnition is a constant. Functors, however are 
constants only of categories other than s and n. 
7Le´sniewski did not have a speciﬁed list of constants. Rather, he invented symbols ad hoc as he went. 
Sometimes he took symbols from the language of set theory which had similar meaning, sometimes he 
took abbreviations of Latin words, sometimes he used Greek capital letters, but there does not seem to 
be any deep uniformity in his choice of constant symbols. 
8This is not Le´sniewski’s original device. His main tool was introducing diﬀerent shapes of brackets 
surrounding the arguments. I will not get into details here. 

 
109 
5. If φ is of category 
τ 
and expressions α1, . . . , αn are of categories σ1, . . . , σn, then 
σ1···σn 
φ(α1, . . . , αn) is a well-formed expression of the language of Ontology of category τ. 
6. If φ is an expression of category s and ζ a variable of any category, then ∀ζ φ is a well-
formed formula of category s. 
4.3 The axiomatic system 
Ontology, in its version from 1920 as described by Le´sniewski in his (1931a: 364-369), 
has a single axiom:9 
∀a,b[a ε b ≡∃c(c ε a) ∧∀c,d(c ε a ∧ d ε a 
c ε d) ∧∀c(c ε a 
c ε b)] 
(4.3)
→ 
→ 
This axiom says that for any a and b, a is b iﬀ (i) for some c, c is a, (ii) for any c and d, 
if c is a and d is a, then c is d, and (iii) for any c, if c is a, then c is also b. 
The interpretation of ε10 is that a ε b is true if and only if there is exactly one object 
which is a, and this object is among the objects which are b (this includes the case where 
b names exactly one object). Accordingly, (i) is supposed to guarantee the non–emptiness 
of a, (ii) is intended to express the requirement that a names at most one object, and 
(iii) is meant to state the inclusion between a and b (‘any object which is a, is b’). 
In a somewhat modernized version (equivalent to the original) one can use standard 
rules for quantiﬁers and apply propositional logic just as is it done in predicate logic.11 
That is, the quantiﬁer elimination and introduction procedures are just an extension of 
classical rules to variables of higher categories. Besides there are a few speciﬁc rules, 
9However, it has certain axiomatic rules that allow for introduction of an inﬁnite number of theorems 
without any premises. 
10Which is in no way determined by the axiomatic basis of Ontology, see (Urbaniak 2006c) for details. 
11Originally, the rules for quantiﬁers and propositional inference were a trivial extension (to quan­
tiﬁcation over variables of diﬀerent categories) of the rules employed in Protothetic, see chapter 3 for 
details. 

110 
especially connected with deﬁnitions and introduction of variables of diﬀerent semantic 
categories. 
Deﬁnitions of constant name expressions have the form: 
∀a[a ε Δ ≡ a ε a ∧ φ] 
(4.4) 
where Δ is the deﬁned term and φ is a formula with a as its only free variable. 
So-called protothetical deﬁnitions. For any semantic categories σ1, . . . , σk and 
any formula β with α1, . . . , αn as its only free variables there are constants τ, τ 0 of cate­
gories s/σ1, . . . , σk and n/σ1, . . . , σk, the former introduced by (4.5), the latter introduced 
by (4.3). 
∀α1,...,αn [τ(α1, . . . , αn) ≡ β] 
(4.5) 
∀a,α1,...,αn [a ε τ 0(α1, . . . , αn) ≡ a ε a ∧ β] 
(4.6) 
So called many–linked deﬁnitions. If:

Finally, the rule of extensionality is: 

111 
1. If α and β are nominal variables and γ is a nominal variable distinct from them 
both, any formula of the form: 
∀γ [γ ε α ≡ γ ε β] →∀χ[χ(α) ≡ χ(β)] 
(4.8) 
is a theorem (where χ is variable of category n
s ). 
2. If τ1 and τ2 are constants of category s/σ1, . . . , σk, τ1
0 and τ2
0 are constants of cat­
egory n/σ1, . . . , σk, and α1, . . . , αk are distinct variables of categories σ1, . . . , σk 
respectively, any formulas of the following forms are theorems: 
∀α1,...,αn [τ1(α1, . . . , αn) ≡ τ2(α1, . . . , αn)] →∀ζ [ζ(τ1) ≡ ζ(τ2)] 
(4.9)

0)] 
(4.10) 
A formula is a theorem of Ontology if it is a closed formula derivable from the axiom 
by the rules listed above. 
It is common to say that Ontology has a single axiom. In a way, this is true. The 
reader may however notice that rules of deﬁnition and the rule of extensionality can 
easily be taken to be axiom schemata. On this reading, it is more appropriate to say 
that Ontology has an inﬁnite number of axioms, one of which is intended to introduce 
ε , the speciﬁc functor of Ontology. 
4.4 Some deﬁnitions 
Here, to indicate the ﬂexibility of the language of Ontology I give some examples of 
deﬁnitions. 
Coextensiveness is deﬁned by: 
∀a,b( (a, b) ≡∀c(c ε a ≡ c ε b)) 
(4.11)
◦

112 
Sometimes it is simpler to use the inﬁx notation (e.g. to write ‘a ◦ b’ instead of 
‘ ◦(a, b)’). Obviously, it is12 symmetric, reﬂexive and transitive: 
∀a,b(a ◦ b ≡ b ◦ a) 
(4.12) 
∀aa ◦ a 
(4.13) 
∀a,b,c(a ◦ b ∧ b ◦ c → a ◦ c) 
(4.14) 
Existence of a’s (‘there is at least one a’) is deﬁned by: 
∀a(ex(a) ≡ ∃bb ε a) 
(4.15) 
‘ex’ is of semantic category n
s . We can also introduce variables and quantiﬁcation for 
that category. Using the rule of extensionality we can easily prove that:13 
s
s 
s
∀a,b(a ◦ b →∀f (f n (a) ≡ f n (b)) 
(4.16)
n 
Coextensiveness of expressions of category n
s can also be deﬁned: 
s 
s
s 
s
s 
,
∀f 
s
s [f n ◦ n
s 
n
s g n ≡∀a(f n (a) ≡ g n (a))] 
(4.17)
n ,g n 
Granted that no ambiguity arises we can write formulas without indices. So the 
deﬁnitions can be abbreviated by: 
∀f,g[f ◦ g ≡ ∀a(f(a) ≡ g(a))] 
(4.18) 
Reﬂexivity, symmetry and transitivity for this sort of coextensiveness holds as well. 
We can also deﬁne inclusion between two expressions of category n
s : 
∀f,g[f ⊆ g ≡∀a(f(a) → g(a))] 
(4.19) 
12In the context where I describe theorems of Ontology (or theorems of Mereology) I will just say ‘it 
is true’ or ‘holds’, still meaning ‘it is provable from the axioms of the system under consideration using 
its rules’. 
13Basically because a ◦ b means ∀c(c ε a ≡ c ε b) so (4.16) results from an instance of the rule of 
extensionality pretty much by deﬁnition of .◦

113 
s 
,
n n
Reﬂexivity and transitivity for ⊆ 
s
s hold. 
Boolean operations on expressions (union, intersection, diﬀerence) of category n
s can 
be deﬁned as well. 
∀a,f,g[f ∪ g(a) ≡ f(a) ∨ g(b)] 
(4.20) 
∀a,f,g[f ∩ g(a) ≡ f(a) ∧ g(b)] 
(4.21) 
∀a,f,g[f − g(a) ≡ f(a) ∧¬g(a)] 
(4.22) 
We can of course ‘climb’ up the ladder of semantic categories. For instance, we can 
deﬁne non-emptiness of a n
s -expression, in the way analogous to that used for deﬁning 
existence. 
∀f [ex(f) ≡∃af(a)] 
(4.23) 
s 
n 
.
The functor ex 
s deﬁned this way is an example of an expression of the category s 
s 
n 
We can deﬁne generalized Boolean operations on expressions of category n
s . For 
instance, the intersection of all names of which f is truly predicable can be deﬁned by: 
∀f,a[a ε ∩ (f) ≡∀b(f(b) 
a ε b)] 
(4.24)
→ 
Similar deﬁnitions are available for other operations and other categories. For instance, 
for two expressions of category 
s would be deﬁned: 
n,n
◦ 
∀f,g(f
g ≡∀a,b(f(a, b) ≡ g(a, b)) 
(4.25)
◦ 
However, mind that the full form of the above deﬁnition would be: 
s 
s
s
s
s 
s
s 
∀f 
s
s (◦ n,n , n,n (f n,n , g n,n ) ≡∀a,b(f n,n (a, b) ≡ g n,n (a, b))
n,n ,g n,n 
For a functor f of category s we can easily deﬁne the domain D(f) and range R(f) of 
n,n 
it: 
∀f,a[D(f)(a) ≡∃bf(a, b)] 
(4.26) 

114 
∀f,a[R(f)(a) ≡∃bf(b, a)] 
(4.27) 
s
For any n,n expression, its restriction to speciﬁc domains and ranges is introduced by: 
∀f,g,h,a,b[Restr(f, g, h)(a, b) ≡ f(a, b) ∧ g(a) ∧ h(b)] 
(4.28) 
For any two-place functor we can deﬁne its reﬂexivity, transitivity, symmetry, anti-
symmetry. Thus we can also express the fact that it is a partial or well-ordering. Pretty 
much all the standard notions can be introduced: ﬁrst, least, maximal, greatest element 
of a given relation, l.u.b.’s, g.l.b.’s, chains etc. (w.r.t. a restricted domain or not). 
4.5 Against universals 
As an example of how the language of Ontology may be used to formalize philosophical 
arguments I will discuss now one of Le´sniewski’s arguments against the existence of 
universals. 
Le´sniewski (1927: 199) constructed an argument against the existence of universals, 
very similar to the one from (1913b: 50–53).14 The diﬀerence is that it does not employ 
the notion of property and it does not employ negative properties. In its original version 
it consists of one assumption and six conclusions following subsequently. Even though 
it is not formalized in Ontology, the way it is phrased makes the formalization relatively 
easy. 
Here is Le´sniewski’s original version. Just like his early argument against universals, 
this one starts with a very speciﬁc assumption about abstract objects: 
However, in connection with that passage and with reference to all those 
who, by reason of the meaning they give to expressions of the type ‘general 
14The latter has been already discussed in section 2.8. 

115 
object’15 with respect to objects a, 16 are inclined to state the proposition ‘if 
X is a general object with respect to objects a, X is b and Y is a, then Y is 
b’,17 I wish to state here that this proposition entails the proposition ‘if there 
exist at least two diﬀerent a, then a general object with respect to objects a 
does not exist,’ in accordance with the following schema: 
(1) If X is a general object with respect to objects a, X is b, [and] also Y is 
a, then Y is b. (assumption) 
(2) If X is a general object with respect to objects a, X is diﬀerent from Z, 
and Z is a, then Z is diﬀerent from Z. 
(3) If X is a general object with respect to objects a, X is identical with Z 
and Y is a, then Y is identical with Z. 
From (2) it follows that: 
(4) If X is a general object with respect to objects a, and Z is a, then X is 
identical with Z. 
(5) If X is a general object with respect to objects a, Z is a and Y is a, then 
(X is a general object with respect to objects a, X is identical with Z, and 
Y is a). 
From (5) and (3) it follows that: 
(6) If X is a general object with respect to objects a, Z is a and Y is a, then 
Y is identical with Z. 
From (6) however it follows that if there exist at least two diﬀerent a, then a 
15By ‘general object’ Le´sniewski understood universals. 
16For instance, in this sense (at ﬁrst approximation), redness would be a general object with respect 
to all red objects. 
17Le´sniewski informally used capital letters as name variables in formulas if the truth of a formula 
required that only one object be assigned to a variable. So, instead of a, if the truth of a formula requires 
that only one object is a, Le´sniewski would use a capital letter, like X, Y or Z. For the sake of uniformity 
I do not use capital letters as name variables in the formalism. 

116 
general object with respect to objects a does not exist. 
Formalized reconstructions of the full argument have been given by Waragai (1981) 
and Gryganiec (2000). I will give a sketch of a simpliﬁed proof which starts with the 
formalization of Le´sniewski’s assumption and ends with his ﬁnal conclusion. 
The assumption is: 
If X is a general object with respect to objects a, X is b, also Y is a, then Y 
is b. (1927: 199) 
The intuition here is pretty much the same as the one behind Le´sniewski’s ﬁrst argu­
ment. We start with a bunch of objects, all named by a name a, and put a condition for 
an object, say c, to be a general object with respect to those objects. Namely, whatever 
is predicable of this general object should be predicable about any of the objects among 
a’s. 
If we represent is using the epsilon, and treat ‘Gen’ as a one-place functor that with 
one name argument, say a, constructs a name Gen(a) (‘The general objects with respect 
to a’s’), this assumption may be formalized by: 
∀a,b,c,d[c ε Gen(a)
(c ε b 
(d ε a 
d ε b))] 
(4.29)
→
→ 
→ 
The conclusion is: 
If X is a general object with respect to objects a, Z is a, and Y is a, then Y 
is identical with Z. 
and we formalize it thus: 
∀a,c,d,e[c ε Gen(a) ∧ d ε a ∧ e ε a 
d ε e ∧ e ε d] 
(4.30)
→ 
The bottom line here is that if something is the general object with respect to a’s, there 
is at most one a, so there can be no object which is general with respect to more than 
one object. 

117 
To give the proof of (4.30) from (4.29) we need two easy theorems of Ontology: 
∀a,b(a ε b 
a ε a) 
(4.31)
→ 
∀a,b,c(a ε c ∧ b ε c ∧ c ε c 
a ε b ∧ b ε a) 
(4.32)
→ 
I skip the proofs. A few words why the above is valid, though. c ε c guarantees that 
exactly one object is c. But if both the object which is a and the object which is b are 
c, they have to be one and the same object. 
Now, let us prove (4.30).

from 8. and 4. 
→ 
11. d ε c 
from 9. and 2. 
12. e ε c 
from 10. and 3. 
13. d ε c ∧ e ε c ∧ c ε c 
d ε e ∧ e ε d 
(4.32) by substitution 
→ 
d ε e ∧ e ε d 
from 13., 11., 12. and 4. 
The importance of this result is of course debatable. It may be equally well taken 
to prove that if there are general objects (i.e. universals), they do not satisfy (4.29). 
Le´sniewski’s comment on the argument is: 

118 
I regard my treatment as the result of a careful formulation of theoretical 
tendencies involved, more or less explicitly, in the argumentation of opponents 
of the diﬀerent kinds of ‘universals’ in various phases of their ‘disputes’ about 
them. If one takes the position that this assertion is a banal one, I would cite 
in defence the circumstance that exponents of ‘philosophy’ defend, regrettably 
often, positions at variance with banal assertions. (1927: 199) 
4.6 Le´sniewski’s original style of presentation 
The question arises: to what extent does my presentation diverge from that of Le´sniewski? 
To address this concern, I will discuss two aspects in which a comparison can be made. 
The language used within the system, in which theorems of various systems are formu­
lated is one of them. Another is the meta–logical approach: I mentioned that I Platonized 
Le´sniewski’s systems for the sake of presentation. What does that mean? 
In his early works on Mereology Le´sniewski just lists the axioms. For instance, the 
ﬁrst formulations of axiom I and of deﬁnition I of Mereology look as follows: 
Axiom I. If object P is a part of object P1, then object P1 is not a part of 
object P . (Le´sniewski 1916: 131) 
Definition I. I use the expression ‘ingredient of object P’ to denote the 
same object P and every part of that object. (Le´sniewski 1916: 132) 
Although at that time he did not give any derivation rules, he nevertheless gave proofs 
for his theorems. For instance, his proof of Theorem XI. (If P1 is an ingredient of object 
P , then P1 is an element of object P ) is: 
Proof: We assume, that: 
(1) P1 is an ingredient of object P . 

119 
About object P we may say — in accordance with Theorem VIII — that 
(2) P is the class of ingredients of object P . 
Using the expressions ‘x’ with the meaning of the expression ‘ingredient of 
object P ’, we infer from assertions (2) and (1) that 
(3) P is the class of objects x. 
(4) P1 is x. 
From assertions (3) and (4) it follows in accordance with Deﬁnition IV that 
(5) P1 is an element of object P . 
Thus, assuming assertion (1), we arrive at assertion (5). It follows from this 
that if P1 is an ingredient of P , then P1 is an element of object P , which was 
to be proved. (Le´sniewski 1916: 139) 
Le´sniewski employs the same style of presentation in all his papers on Mereology, up 
to Chapter X of his ‘On the Foundations of Mathematics’. Chapter XI introduces his 
ε and describes the axiom of Ontology. There (Le´sniewski 1931a: 369), he employs a 
formalism based on that of Principia: 
(A, a)::A ε a.≡ ∴(∃B).B ε A ∴ (B, C): B ε A . C ε A. ⊃. B ε C ∴ (B) : B ε A . ⊃ 
. B ε a 
He uses the same notation when he describes his Protothetic in 1929a. For instance, 
his formulation of two axioms of the simplest subsystem of Protothetic that he discusses 
is (p. 423): 
A1.
p ≡ r. ≡ .q ≡ p: ≡: r ≡ q 
A2.
p ≡ .q ≡ r : ≡: p ≡ q. ≡ r 
In the same manner he states and proves theorems of this system. When he describes 

120 
his S1 (Le´sniewski 1929a: 441) he switches to his own notation18 and usually keeps using 
it when proving theorems of Protothetic in subsequent publications (he did not publish 
proofs of any theorems of Ontology or Mereology after he introduced his notation). 
Another question is: how did Le´sniewski describe his rules of inference? On one 
hand, he brieﬂy described his rules informally, but this description is not very precise. 
For instance, when he introduces rules of inference for S1 he starts by saying: 
Using the following six directives, I obtained new propositions in S1 on the 
basis of propositions already belonging to the system (for the present I limit 
myself in this section to a quite general characterization of these directives): 
(α) the ‘detachment’ directive – as in S. 
(β) the ‘substitution directive’? 
(γ) the ‘distribution of quantiﬁers’ directive by which, in case some thesis T 
compounded of a universal quantiﬁer Q and an equivalence A standing under 
the quantiﬁer already belonging to the system, it is permissible to add to 
the system a new thesis which is formed from thesis T through ‘transferring’ 
— by an exactly determined (but in practice, no doubt, somewhat artiﬁcial) 
way — all or only some variables contained in the quantiﬁer into the quan­
tiﬁers in front of the left and in front of the right side of the equivalence 
A. . . (Le´sniewski 1929a: 442) 
The star sends the reader to a footnote, where Le´sniewski says: 
Cf. below in paragraph 11, TE XLVII and TE XLVIII and further below in 
the same (paragraph 11 point 4) of the direction concerning the method of 
construction of S5. 
What are the TE’s that he mentions? Because Le´sniewski was a nominalist, he 
18I discussed his notation in section 3.3. 

121 
believed that a description of a logical system, instead of being a description of an 
abstract set of formulas, is rather a set of rules according to which one can develop 
a system of inscriptions which would count as theorems of his system. Rules which 
determine how a particular, token–based version of a system can be written down are 
called terminological explanations. 19 They are the way that Le´sniewski ultimately 
chose to describe his systems. 
Terminological explanations deﬁnitively diﬀer from what we nowadays would consider 
a description of a logical system. First, there are no two separate sets of rules, those 
of formation and those of derivation, but only one set of general rules whose ultimate 
purpose is to determine what inscriptions can be added to a system when one is developing 
his own group of inscriptions. There are, overall, 106 rules which describe notions required 
for his explanation of theoremhood of Protothetic and Ontology. The language in which 
they are formulated is ﬁlled with Le´sniewski’s idiosyncratic terms and abbreviations, 
which makes it quite hermetic, even though the formulation is extremely meticulous.20 
The idea that there is no single axiomatic system of Ontology, but rather a general set 
of rules which describe how one should proceed when one wants to write down his own 
‘copy’ of inscriptions that would count as theorems of Ontology resulted also in a quite 
speciﬁc view of an axiomatic system. 
Instead of postulating that there exists a set of well–formed formulas which just 
needs to be deﬁned, Le´sniewski rather insists that there is no unique system of Ontology. 
Rather, there are instructions as to how to produce certain inscriptions that would count 
as theorems of Ontology (so, strictly speaking, it is improper to speak of the system of 
Ontology or the system of Protothetic). A side–eﬀect of this approach is that certain 
notions are relative to the stage of development of an actual system of Ontology. For 
instance, a notion of a formula is relative to a stage of a development of the formal 
19Le´sniewski used the term ‘Terminologische Erkl¨arungen’. 
20His deﬁnitions do not even include the notion of a well–formed formula. 

122 
system. Also, for instance, one is allowed to write down formulas that follow from certain 
deﬁnitions after writing down those deﬁnitions. 
A terminological explanation21 usually explains a technical term that Le´sniewski uses 
to describe expressions that occur in his systems. They are also formulated in terms 
of the shape and position of symbols. Let us take a closer look at how he develops his 
terminological explanations. 
In Le´sniewski’s notation the ﬁrst axiom of Protothetic is:22 
A1 bpqrcd d( d( d(pr) d(qp)) d(rq))e 
Let us now assume A1 names exactly this token. 
The underlying language of Le´sniewski’s meta–logic is the language of Ontology. So 
the basic atomic proposition is of the type a ε b. Then we have the expression Id(a), 
‘same object as a’, which can be deﬁned by:23 
∀a,b(a ε Id(b) ≡ a ε b ∧ b ε a) 
We also have term negation, ∼ a: 
∀a,b(a ε ∼ b ≡ a ε a ∧¬a ε b) 
And for each k we have deﬁned the term union and intersection:24 
∀a,a1,a2,...,ak (a ε a1 ∩ a2 ∩· · · ∩ ak ≡ a ε a1 ∧ a ε a2 ∧· · · ∧ a ε ak) 
21Terminological explanations describing Protothetic are to be found in (Le´sniewski 1929a: 469-488), 
those describing Ontology are given in (Le´sniewski 1930b), and certain TE’s concerned with deﬁnitions 
have been published in (Le´sniewski 1931b). 
22Except I do not bother to vary the size of brackets. Le´sniewski usually followed the rule that the 
larger the scope of a bracket, the larger the bracket itself. 
23Note that saying that a is the same object as b is not the same as saying that a is b. The former 
entails that there is a unique object b, the latter does not. 
24Strictly speaking, there is no single expression of Ontology that deﬁnes the notions of term union 
and intersection which generates the given schemas. For any given k we can formulate a deﬁnition but 
no expression of Ontology deﬁnes those notions for any k in a uniform way along these lines (basically, 
because in Ontology there is no device that would allow us to quantify over numbers in subscripts). 
What we can get, however, is the notion of generalized union and intersection. Granted that φ is of 

\ 
123 
∀a,a1,a2,...,ak (a ε a1 ∪ a2 ∩· · · ∩ ak ≡ a ε a1 ∨ a ε a2 ∨· · · ∨ a ε ak) 
Two more relations: equinumerosity denoted by ‘∞’ and ‘having fewer objects 
than’ denoted by ‘∂’.25 The sentence ‘a∞b’ reads ‘there are as many objects a as there 
are objects b’. The sentence ‘a∂b’ reads ‘there are more objects b than there are objects 
a’. Both kinds of sentences are also true when there are no objects b at all and the 
intuitive truth conditions for a∞b or a∂b are satisﬁed. 
Now a bunch of speciﬁcally meta-linguistic terms. A name constant ‘vrb’ abbreviates 
the word ‘word’. Basically, every ﬁnite sequence on the alphabet of a language which 
is not further divisible into constituent parts which are expressions of that language is a 
word. Some examples of words are: ‘p’, ‘ d’, ‘(’, ‘b’, ‘c’, ‘1ingr’, ‘sbqnt’.26 On the other 
hand expressions like ‘(p)’, ‘p dq’ are not words. No subexpression of a word is a word. 
The word ‘expression’ is abbreviated by ‘expr’. Any ﬁnite sequence of successive 
words is an expression. A general name naming all parentheses is ‘prnt’. A name 
which names all and only left parentheses is ‘prntl’. Note that corners used to express 
quantiﬁcation (‘b’, ‘c’, ‘d’, ‘e’) are not taken to be parentheses. 
We also assume that we can identify matching parentheses. In Le´sniewski’s own 
notation each pair of matching parentheses in a formula has its own shape or size. If 
they diﬀer only in their scope their length diﬀers.27 If they surround an expression of 
a diﬀerent semantic category, they have diﬀerent shapes. Change in length is not a

of category s as follows: 
n 
∀a,φ(a ε 
φ ≡∀b(φ(b) → a ε b)) 

 
∀a,φ(a ε 
φ ≡∃b(φ(b) ∧ a ε b)) 
25The latter for mainly aesthetical is not the symbol that Le´sniewski originally used. 
26Remember that ‘ d’ is Le´sniewski’s symbol for equivalence and expressions ‘ b’, ‘ c’, ‘ d’, ‘ e ’ mark 
bound variables and the quantiﬁcation scope respectively. 
27This, of course, is not the only possible way of identifying matching parentheses. However, note that 
it is quite probable that another obvious ways that we are familiar with would depend on our ability to 
count either dots in a symbol or words in a formula. 

124 
diﬀerence in shape. Thus, in a sense, we have groups of matching parenthesis-tokens. If 
a is a parenthesis, its matching parenthesis (which is its symmetrical parenthesis) is 
denoted by ‘prntsym(a)’. 
We also are able to recognize equiform expressions. Equiformity is a relation between 
expressions (which are taken to be tokens). Change in size does not impede equiformity. 
Two equiform expressions written in two diﬀerent places are always taken to be numer­
ically diﬀerent expressions. Given an expression a, a name that names all expressions 
equiform to it is abbreviated by ‘cnf (a)’. 
A name that names all subexpressions of an expression a is abbreviated by ‘ingr(a)’. 
The subexpression relation is taken to be reﬂexive.28 Given an expression a, the name 
that names expressions preceding a is ‘prcd(a)’, the name that names all expres­
sions that follow a is ‘scd(a)’, the name which names the ﬁnal word preceding a is 
‘Uprcd(a)’, and the name of the ﬁnal word occurring in a is ‘Uingr(a)0. In parallel, the 
n-th word occurring in a is denoted by ‘ningr(a)’ (e.g. ‘1ingr(a)’, ‘2ingr(a)’ etc.). 
Instead of material equivalence in terminological explanations, Le´sniewski’s employed 
a meta–linguistic “deﬁnability” operator ‘=’, where ‘a ε b=p’ is to be read as ‘I say of an 
object a that it is a b if and only if p’ (Le´sniewski 1929a: 471). For the sake of clarity I 
will use ‘=:’ instead. 
Let us now take a look at the ﬁrst fourteen of Le´sniewski’s terminological explanations. 
This should give us a good insight into how he proceeded without getting us entangled 
in details. 
Terminological Explanation 1. introduces a new term ‘vrb1’ as a name of any 
token equiform to ‘b’. It says that for any a, a is the “word number one” iﬀ it is equiform 
28Note that here Le´sniewski reads ‘ingr(a)’ as ‘belonging to a’. The ingr relation in his meta–logic is 
not to be confused with the ingredient relation of his Mereology (see Deﬁnition I on p. 151). Although 
Mereology is still valid if the ingredient operator is interpreted as the subexpression relation (which allows 
us to use some bits of Mereology in Le´sniewski’s meta–logic), but being a subexpression is something 
more than being a part, for obvious reasons. 

125 
to the ﬁrst word in A1:29 
∀a(a ε vrb1 =: a ε cnf (1ingr(A1))) 
Terminological Explanations 2-4. In a similar manner ‘vrb2’ is assigned to ‘c’, 
‘vrb3’ to ‘d’ and ‘vrb4’ to ‘e’: 
∀a(a ε vrb2 =: a ε cnf (5ingr(A1))) 
∀a(a ε vrb3 =: a ε cnf (6ingr(A1))) 
∀a(a ε vrb4 =: a ε cnf (Uingr(A1))) 
Terminological Explanation 5. The expression ‘trm’ names all expressions which 
are neither parentheses nor corners:30 
∀a(a ε expr → (a ε trm =: a ε ¬(prnt)∧a ε ∼ (vrb1)∧a ε ∼ (vrb2)∧a ε ∼ (vrb3)∧a ε ∼ (vrb4))) 
Terminological Explanation 6. The expression ‘int(b)’ names all words which 
occur in b but are neither the ﬁrst nor the last one. 
∀a,b(a ε int(b) =: b ε expr ∧ a ε vrb ∧ 
a ε ingr(b) ∧ a ε (1ingr(b)) ∧ a ε (Uingr(b))))
¬

Terminological Explanation 7. This one is somewhat complicated. It says that a 
is a cmpl(b) iﬀ: 
29The notation that Le´sniewski originally employed in his terminological explanations is based on the 
Principia notation. Also, Le´sniewski uses ‘∈’ instead of ‘ ε’, even though the meaning that he assigns to 
‘ ∈ ’ is the same. For instance, TE 1. originally has the form ‘[A]: A ∈ vrb1. = .A ∈ cnf (1ingr(A1))’. 
Also, Le´sniewski does not discuss his explanations in natural language. Those parts of his papers which 
contain his terminological presentations are just lists of numbered formulas. 
30Presumably, a is taken here to be an expression and the deﬁnition should rather have the form: 
∀a(a ε trm =: a ε expr ∧¬(a ε (prnt) ∨ a ε (vrb1) ∨ a ε (vrb2) ∨ a ε (vrb3) ∨ a ε (vrb4))) 

126 
1. a is an expression, 
2. for any word c in a there is a d which is a b such that c occurs in d, 
3. for any c, d, e, if c and d are both b’s and they share a word, they are the same 
expression, 
4. any c which is a b is an expression occurring in a. 
Formally: 
∀a,b[a ε cmpl(b) =: 
a ε expr ∧∀c(c ε vrb ∧ c ε ingr(a) →∃d(d ε b ∧ c ε ingr(d))) ∧ 
∀c,d,e(c ε b ∧ d ε b ∧ e ε vrb ∧ e ε ingr(c) ∧ e ε ingr(d) 
c ε Id(d)) ∧
→ 
∀c(c ε b → c ε expr ∧ ingr(a))] 
Since from the above formula the meaning of ‘a ε cmpl(b)’ is not immediately obvious, 
consider the following example. Let ‘a’ name the following token: 
d(pq) 
Let us temporarily name the ﬁrst word in a by ‘1’, the second by ‘2’, the third by ‘3’, the 
fourth by ‘4’, the ﬁfth by ‘5’. Also, let us call any substring of a composed of symbols 
n, . . . , k ‘n . . . k’ (e.g. the string of ﬁrst two symbols of a is denoted by ‘12’ and the string 
of two last symbols of a by ‘45’). 
What name can serve as b in this case? By condition 4, b may name only those 
expressions which occur in a (i.e. substrings of a). By condition 2, any word that occurs 
in a has to occur in one of b’s. By condition 3, any two distinct strings denoted by b 
do not share a word. So, usually (if only a has length > 1) b is a common term naming 
mutually exclusive substrings of a such that all words in a are listed when we list all 
words occurring in b’s. 
Here are examples of names that would or would not work as cmpl(a): 

127 
Name 
1 ∪ 3 ∪ 4 ∪ 5 ∪ 2 
345 ∪ 12 
12 ∪ 5 ∪ 34 ∪ cnf (a) 
1 ∪ 2 ∪ 45 
12 ∪ 5 ∪ 234 
cmpl(b)? 
Yes. 
Yes. 
No. 
No. 
No. 
Comments 
Violates 4. 
Violates 2. 
Violates 3. 
So, in a sense, an expression a is cmpl(b) iﬀ a is the composition of all expressions 
named by ‘b’, where no two expressions named by ‘b’ overlap. 
Terminological Explanation 8. Here we learn what a quantiﬁer is. An expression 
a is a qntf iﬀ: 
1. The ﬁrst word in a is equiform to: ‘b’. 
2. The last word in a is equiform to: ‘c’. 
3. There are some words between the lower corners, 
4. none of which is a parenthesis or a corner. 
5. No two distinct equiform expression occur between the corners. 
Formally: 
∀a[a ε qntf =: 
1ingr(a) ε vrb1 ∧ Uingr(a) ε vrb2 ∧ 
∃bb ε int(a) ∧ 
∀b(b ε int(a) 
b ε trm) ∧
→ 
∀b,c(b ε int(a) ∧ c ε int(a) ∧ b ε cnf (c) 
b ε Id(c))]
→ 

128 
Terminological Explanation 9. This terminological explanation (as simpliﬁed by 
Adolf Lindenbaum, see (Le´sniewski 1929a: 473)) tells us what a scope of a quantiﬁer is. 
An expression a is a sbqntf iﬀ: 
1. Some b is inside a. 
2. For any b which is either the ﬁrst word of a or a word inside a there are fewer 
tokens of ‘d’ than there are tokens of ‘e’ in the part of a which follows after b. 
3. For any b which is either inside a or the last word of a there are fewer tokens of ‘e’ 
than there are tokens of ‘d’ in the part of a which precede b. 
Basically, this tells us that a scope of a quantiﬁer (i) begins with a ‘d’ (otherwise 
requirement 3 would be violated by, say, the second word in a, which by requirement 
1 has to exist), (ii) ends with a ‘e’ (otherwise requirement 2 would be violated by, say, 
the second last word in a, which exists by requirement 1), and (iii) cannot contain 
mismatched ‘scope-markers’. For the last point contrast ‘dpqdree’ which is a sbqntf with 
‘dpqdre’ where ﬁrst three words violate requirement 2 or with ‘dpqere’ where the last two 
words violate requirement 3. 
∀a[a ε sbqntf =: 
∃bb ε int(a) ∧ 
∀b(b ε 1ingr(a) ∨ b ε int(a) → 
vrb3 ∩ ingr(a) ∩ scd(b) ∂ vrb4 ∩ inr(a) ∩ scd(b)) ∧ 
∀b(b ε int(a) ∨ b ε Uingr(a) → 
vrb4 ∩ ingr(a) ∩ prcd(b) ∂ vrb3 ∩ ingr(a) ∩ prcd(b))] 
Terminological Explanation 10. This deﬁnes what a quantiﬁed expression (‘qnr1’) 
is. An expression a is a qnr1 iﬀ: 

129 
1. Some b is a quantiﬁer, occurs in a and the ﬁrst word of a is a word in that quantiﬁer. 
2. Some b is a scope of a quantiﬁer, occurs in a and the last word of a occurs in b. 
3. a is the composition of any quantiﬁer and any scope of a quantiﬁer which satisfy 
the ﬁrst two conditions. 
In other words, a qnr1 is constructed by putting a quantiﬁer and a scope of a quantiﬁer 
immediately one after another. 
∀a[a ε qnr1 =: 
∃(b)(b ε qntf ∧ b ε ingr(a) ∧ 1ingr(a) ε ingr(b)) ∧ 
∃b(b ε sqntf ∧ b ε ingr(a) ∧ Uingr(a) ε ingr(b)) ∧ 
∀b,c(b ε qntf ∧ b ε ingr(a) ∧ c ε sbntf ∧ c ε ingr(a) ∧ 
1ingr(a) ε ingr(b) ∧ Uingr(a) ε ingr(c) 
a ε Cmpl(b ∪ c))]
→ 
Terminological Explanation 11. Given a quantiﬁed expression (i.e. a qnr1), we 
can also form the name of its quantiﬁer. An expression a is the quantiﬁer of b (Qntf(b)) 
iﬀ b is a quantiﬁed expression, a is a quantiﬁer and the ﬁrst word in b occurs in a (i.e. a 
is the initial quantiﬁer in a quantiﬁed expression b). 
∀a(a ε Qntf(b) =: b ε qnr1 ∧ a ε qntf ∩ ingr(b) ∧ 1ingr(b) ε ingr(a)) 
Terminological Explanation 12. Similarly we can deﬁne the scope of the quantiﬁer 
in a quantiﬁed expression. An expression a is the scope of a quantiﬁer in b iﬀ (i) b is a 
quantiﬁed expression, (ii) a is a scope of a quantiﬁer, (iii) a occurs in b, and (iv) the last 
word in b is occurs in a. 
∀a,b(a ε Sbqntf(b) =: b ε qnr1 ∧ a ε sbqntf ∧ a ε ingr(b) ∧ Uingr(b) ε ingr(a)) 

130 
Terminological Explanation 13. If b is not a quantiﬁed expression, the essence of 
b is b itself. In the other case, the content of the scope of the quantiﬁer in b is the essence 
of b. The way Le´sniewski puts it is: 
∀a[a ε Essnt(b) ≡=: 
a ε Cmpl(int(Sbqntf(b))) ∨ (a ε expr ∧ a ε Id(b) ∧ a ε qrn1)]
¬
Terminological Explanation 14. An expression a in the scope of a quantiﬁer in a 
quantiﬁed expression c is a variable bound with respect to a variable b occurring within 
the quantiﬁer (a ε var(b, c)) iﬀ: 
1. b is a word inside the quantiﬁer of c, 
2. a is equiform to b, 
3. a occurs in the scope of the quantiﬁer in c, between the corners, and 
4. for any d, e, if d occurs in c, e is a word inside the quantiﬁer of d, a is equiform to 
e and a occurs in d, then d is the same expression as c. 
In other words, a ε var(b, c) iﬀ a is a variable inside the scope of the quantiﬁer of c, 
equiform to a variable bound by the quantiﬁer of c and there is no other quantiﬁer within 
c which binds the same variable. 
∀a,b,c[a ε var(b, c) =: 
b ε int(Qntf(c)) ∧ a ε cnf (b) ∧ a ε ingr(Essnt(c) ∧ 
∀d,e(d ε ingr(c) ∧ e ε int(Qntf(d)) ∧ a ε cnf (e) ∧ a ε ingr(d) 
d ε Id(c))]
→ 
The above explanations should be suﬃcient as an introduction to Le´sniewski’s style 
of doing meta–logic. As the reader might see, they are quite elaborate and formal.31 
31It is interesting that when formalizing the syntax of his systems he actually used a language which, 
in a way, required some understanding of this syntax. 

131 
He uses terminological explanations to deﬁne quite a few notions: quantiﬁers, variables, 
functors etc. He uses TE’s to introduce semantical categories and, eventually, to describe 
what inscriptions at what stage of the creation of a system would count as theorems. 
So, the task of presenting Le´sniewski’s systems in a more accessible manner is two– 
fold. First, when one represents theorems that Le´sniewski has proved, one has to provide 
a uniﬁed notation that at least in certain respects resembles the nowadays mainstream 
way of writing down formulas. That is how I approached formulas provided by Le´sniewski. 
I translated them all into a fairly uniﬁed and modern notation. I eliminated Le´sniewski’s 
notation of propositional connectives and I modernized the Principia notation so that 
all the formulas have a fairly standard shape. Second, instead of going through termi­
nological explanations in detail, the systems have to be described according to modern 
standards: one has to describe the language and its formation rules, the axioms of a sys­
tem and the derivation rules. I try to sketch these, so that the resulting system formally 
is isomorphic to any set of all possible theorems system of Protothetic or Ontology (or 
Mereology) described by Le´sniewski. This also explains in what way the present account 
is a “Platonization” of Le´sniewski’s systems. Instead of inscriptions I talk about formu­
las and instead of inscriptions that would count as theorems of a system at a present 
stage of its development I just assume that all the theorems already belong to a certain 
determinate set, and our job is simply to deﬁne this set. This of course does not mean 
I do not appreciate the philosophical importance of inscriptional syntax. Quite the con­
trary, I believe that talk about abstract objects can be eliminated. This does not mean 
that we should not pretend to talk about abstract objects when it serves the brevity and 
simplicity of our presentation.

4.7 (Annotated) further readings 
The ﬁrst thing the reader may want to take a look at is the only existing collection of pa­
pers 
related 
directly 
to 
Le´sniewski’s 
Ontology 
and 
Mereology 
(Srzednicki and Rickey 1984). It contains English translations of (Kruszewski 1925) and 
(Soboci´nski 1949b, 1954a). (Lejewski 1954b, 1958, 1969), (S lupecki 1955), (Canty 1969), 
(Iwanu´s 1973), and (Clay 1966, 1970, 1974a) are also included. 
The simplest subsystem of Ontology we get when we allow only name variables and 
do not admit any quantiﬁcation. A general account and metatheory of calculi of this kind 
can be found in (Pietruszczak 1991). Pietruszczak constructs various calculi of this kind, 
and, more importantly, provides a general method for proving completeness of those with 
respect to set-theoretic semantics. Since the book was published only in Polish his work 
is relatively unknown. 
Quite independently, a subsystem of Ontology of this same sort (quantiﬁer–free, 
name variables only), called L1 was studied by Ishimoto (1977); Ishimoto and Kobayashi 
(1982); Ishimoto (1997). 
More general systems are generated by introducing quantiﬁers binding name variables 
only. Some authors call the subsystem of Ontology which contains only this sort of 
quantiﬁers ‘elementary Ontology’. 
Some other authors use ‘elementary Ontology’ to refer to a rather stronger system 
which admits also second-order variables and quantiﬁers binding them (that is, we also 
allow variables representing functors that take name arguments only), but no variables 
(or constants) of other categories. Elementary Ontology in the latter sense is discussed 
especially by Iwanu´s (1973) — where it is also shown equivalent to the theory of atomic 
Boolean algebras and the classical theory of set algebras. Iwanu´s also provides an inter­
esting proof of decidability of Elementary Ontology. 

133 
Elementary Ontology is also discussed in the ﬁrst part of one of the best surveys 
on Ontology (S lupecki 1955). S lupecki, however, discusses also some aspects of non-
elementary Ontology, which is obtained mainly by adding the rule of extensionality. He 
proves that deﬁnitions in the system satisfy the condition of translatability, i.e., for every 
φ which contains a deﬁned term there is a provably equivalent expression φ0 which does 
not contain this term. Interestingly, deﬁnitions are creative in the system. They can be 
made non-creative by introducing two axiom schemata. S lupecki also sketches the proof 
of the theorem that Ontology is consistent relative to Protothetic. 
A speciﬁc type of functional completeness of Elementary Ontology with respect to ε 
has been proven by Urbaniak (2006a). 
(Lejewski 1958) is intended as a survey of full–blown Ontology. It contains more 
elaborate intuitive explanations of the intended meaning of epsilon and some other con­
nectives deﬁnable in Ontology. Lejewski also proves that Ontology can be constructed 
with inclusion as the sole primitive term (instead of ε ). This inclusion functor in the 
classical formulation of Ontology is deﬁned by (4.19) on p. 112. 
Various equivalent axiomatizations of Ontology are discussed in (Soboci´nski 1934). 
(Mi´eville 2004) is a recent (and quite relaxed) text intended as an introduction to 
Ontology. 
Canty (1969) explains the relation between the epsilon, the distributive predication, 
and higher-order epsilon connectives, although the discussion is quite informal. 
Urbaniak (2006c) proves that in set-theoretic semantics the classical Ontology has at 
least ℵ0 non-standard models with a non-standard ε . 
Kubi´nski (1969) gives a convincing sketch of a proof that Ontology is absolutely non-
categorical (i.e. that no set of formulas of Ontology deﬁnes a class of models up to 
isomorphism). 
Some research has been done on replacing epsilon with another functor which would 

134 
be more intuitive for English native speakers. Lejewski (1977) has shown that the functor 
of (weak) inclusion32 deﬁned by (4.19) can serve the purpose. 
Le´sniewski’s systems raise also certain philosophical concerns. One of the crucial ques­
tions (which I discuss in chapter 7) is the meaning of quantiﬁers and variables. Le´sniewski 
claimed that his systems are nominalistic but he used something that nowadays can be 
easily construed as higher–order quantiﬁcation. How to interpret the role of variables 
and quantiﬁers in Le´sniewski’s systems to avoid this clash? Another interesting aspect is 
how Ontology can be applied in philosophy. Does formalizing arguments using Ontology 
provide us with a new insight into their quality or meaning? 
(Munitz 1974) is an interesting book that covers some diﬀerences in expressing exis­
tence in various logical systems, Ontology included. Existential assumptions and com­
mitments as expressed in Ontology were, it seems, ﬁrst discussed in (Lejewski 1954b). 
As contrasted with something intuitively false in a ﬁrst order language: 
∃x(x does not exist.) 
(4.33) 
it is provable in Ontology that: 
∃a¬ex(a) 
(4.34) 
that is, that for some a, a does not exist. This, ﬁrst of all, indicates that in Ontology (in 
contrast with Quine’s approach) existential commitment is not expressed by quantiﬁca­
tion. An interesting commentary to Lejewski is (Kearns 1969). 
Prior (1965) argues that variables in Ontology represent class names rather than 
singular or empty or common terms. However, he does not explain what the diﬀerence 
is and why it is so important. He does not explain what he means by a class name.33 
32Strong inclusion requires the non-emptiness of the ﬁrst argument. 
33Also, the main argument that he presents is not very compelling. It seems to be this: regular names 
cannot be logically complex (he does not explain this notion either), class names can, names in Ontology 
can be complex, therefore names in Ontology are class names. 

135 
Sagal (1973) criticizes Prior.34 
Since the quantiﬁers in Le´sniewski’s systems do not (or at least, were not intended 
to) express ontological commitment, a perfectly legitimate question arises as to what 
those quantiﬁers were supposed to do and how we are to interpret variables that occur 
in the system. For instance, there is some similarity between Le´sniewski’s account and 
the theory of plural quantiﬁcation developed by Boolos (1998a) (informally discussed by 
Simons (1997)).35 
The question of ontological commitment of Ontology is also raised by Simons (1995). 
Simons suggests a diﬀerent criterion of ontological commitment (which is, unfortunately 
quite vague): 
I shall say that a set of propositions . . . ontologically commits to those objects 
(of whatever ontological category) that, in some sense of ‘exist’ have to exist 
if all the propositions in the set are true. 
and argues that Ontology has no ontological commitments. His claim that Ontology is 
valid if the domain of individuals is empty is certainly true (he gives a proof). However, 
this does not seem to answer exactly the question whether it is free of any commitments. 
In his proof, the truth-conditions of higher-order statements tacitly do much of the heavy 
lifting, and the question whether their use does not involve any commitment has not been 
successfully answered. Simons attempts to provide some hints in (Simons 1985b), where 
he suggests his ‘combinatorial semantics’ in which name variables (are supposed to) 
34He does so mostly on the grounds that this reading disagrees with Le´sniewski’s dislike of abstract 
objects. 
35There are of course some diﬀerences. For Le´sniewski, quantiﬁcation does not express existence 
(i.e. ∃aφ, philosophically is not to be meant as stating that there exists a such that φ). For Boolos 
individual quantiﬁcation commits one to individuals and the higher-order quantiﬁcation in the standard 
interpretation commits one to certain kinds of abstract entities, but monadic higher-order quantiﬁcation 
interpreted as relating to plurals commits us to only whatever individuals we need to render the relevant 
sentence true. Also, Le´sniewski assumes that the category of names contains singular names, empty 
names and plurals indiscernibly. Boolos treats plurals as another group in its own right. He has a 
syntactic distinction between two kinds of nominal variables. I discuss the relation in more detail in 
chapter 7. 

136 
range over ‘ways of meaning’, but it is not a precise account and this approach has not 
yet been fully developed and assessed. It must be admitted, however, that he poses an 
interesting problem: how should one construct a formal semantics for Le´sniewski’s logic 
which performs the task a formal semantics normally performs, but does not assume 
explicitly or implicitly the existence of abstract objects? 
K¨ung and Canty (1970) argue that the quantiﬁcation in Ontology is not objectual 
(referential).36 The authors claim that the interpretation should be substitutional (al­
though they suggest that they can be interpreted as referential over a realm of sets asso­
ciated with a domain of objects). Kielkopf (1977) criticizes the view in its whole gener­
ality, but he introduces some other subtle interpretations of quantiﬁers which are neither 
straightforward substitutional nor referential. K¨ung (1977) applies so-called prologue-
functors (developed by K¨ung (1974)) like ‘whatever extension the inscriptions equiform 
with the following item are taken to have . . . the following is asserted . . . ’ to account for 
quantiﬁcation in Le´sniewski’s systems (whether this reading is nominalistic depends on 
how the notion of extension is understood, and providing a nominalistic explanation of 
what an extension is is not an easy matter). 
A very interesting approach to semantics of Ontology has been taken by Rickey (1985). 
Quantiﬁed name calculi are interpreted in ﬁrst-order two-sorted models. One sort is the 
sort of individuals, another sort is the sort of names. A binary relation on the Cartesian 
product of those two sorts is added, which intuitively corresponds to the relation of 
36The quantiﬁcation in a given language is called referential (or objectual) with respect to a given 
semantics of this language if the truth in a model of quantiﬁed statements is dependent upon there 
being (or not) some objects in the domain of this model satisfying (or not) the formula resulting from 
the initial formula by deleting the quantiﬁer. Or, in other words, in the objectual interpretation variables 
in a model are assigned objects in the domain of this model. The objectual reading is often opposed to 
the substitutional reading, where variables are rather associated with a substitution class — the class 
of expressions (which do not belong to the domain of the model), and the satisfaction of a formula in a 
model is deﬁned via some results of substitution being true (or not). Clearly, Ontology as an axiomatic 
system can be given both an objectual and a substitutional interpretation. Presumably, the question of 
whether quantiﬁcation in Ontology boils down to something like: ‘which interpretation is in accordance 
with Le´sniewski’s views?’. 

137 
naming. 
Soboci´nski (1949b) deals with Le´sniewski’s solution to Russell’s paradox (1949b was 
published in a few parts, but is reprinted in whole in Srzednicki and Rickey 1984). There 
are some reasons to think that this solution is not satisfactory, as I argue in detail in 
chapter 6 (see also Urbaniak 2008). 
Lejewski (1985) is an interesting attempt to use the expressivity of the language 
of Ontology to capture main intuitions pertaining to sets. I discuss this attempt and 
indicate its weaknesses in section 6.6. 
Deﬁnite descriptions as formulated in Le´sniewski’s Ontology have also been studied. 
Hi˙z (1977) proved that the deﬁnition of descriptions in ?14.01 of Principia Mathematica 
when formulated in the language of Ontology, is in Ontology provably equivalent to 
the axiom of Ontology. Another discussion of Russell’s theory of descriptions from a 
Le´sniewskian point of view is (Lejewski 1960), to which Russell responded in (Russell 
1960). 
Lambert and Scharle (1967) argue that the system of free logic FLt is translatably 
equivalent to a ﬁrst-order modiﬁcation of elementary Ontology called L40. The authors 
suggest that their translation “Provides for the ﬁrst time . . . a way of interpreting at least 
the ﬁrst order fragment of one version of Le´sniewski’s system called Ontology in more 
general parlance”. Simons (1981) correctly criticizes this claim, where he points out that 
L40 (i) is not a subsystem of Ontology, because it has an additional axiom requiring that 
no term be general, and (ii) even if it were a subsystem, it would be a narrow part of 
Ontology, and so it is false that free logics provide a more general parlance to speak of 
Ontology. Interesting modiﬁcations of Ontology that allow to embed some free logics are 
developed by Simons (1985a). 
Grzegorczyk (1955) compares Ontology to Boolean algebra and suggests that Ontology 
formally resembles the theory of complete atomic Boolean algebras with constants and 

138 
functions of an arbitrary high type. Iwanu´s (1973: 202) elaborates on this issue, empha­
sizing some diﬀerences: Boolean algebras are not provided with a rule of deﬁnitions, so 
the statement should be conditional: if we extend the theory of Boolean algebras with 
a good account of deﬁnitions (which is pretty much a translation of Le´sniewski’s rules), 
then there is a correspondence. Also, the proof of the equivalence between elementary 
Ontology (in the stronger sense) and theory of Boolean algebras states something about 
a proper subsystem of Ontology only. Interestingly, it was Le´sniewski’s research that 
inspired Tarski’s work on the foundations of Boolean algebras (1935), which played an 
essential role in the development of Boolean algebras. 
Stachniak (1981) develops a strengthening of Ontology, LDF and a semantics for this 
calculus, where models are taken to be atomic Boolean algebras enriched by a speciﬁc 
set of functions and relations. The strengthening consists in including an axiom schema 
which, brieﬂy speaking, resembles the axiom of comprehension. Stachniak uses a fairly 
standard method of constructing models from constants to prove the completeness and 
compactness theorems. He also discusses the ultraproduct construction of models for 
Ontology. Deﬁnitions in LDF are not creative. 
Lebiedewa (1969a; 1969b) extends Ontology by introducing modalities. 
There is also an interesting modiﬁcation of Ontology which is meant to deal with 
vague terms (Kubi´nski 1958). Kubi´nski (1959) developed also a modiﬁcation of Ontology 
that is intended to deal with apparent contradictions of the form ‘a is b and a is not 
b’. Unfortunately, both papers are available in Polish only. Kubi´nski (1960) extends 
Ontology with means to express something like ‘a is more like b than like c’. 
An ontological version of the axiom of choice is independent of Ontology. Kowalski 
(1977) studies the extension of Ontology obtained by adding this axiom, and Davis 
(1975) discusses various formulations of this axioms. Perhaps the most elegant of these 

139 
formulations is: 
∃f ∀a,g(g(a) 
g(f(a))) 
(4.35)
→ 
An interesting extension of Ontology is constructed when we add an axiom of inﬁnity. 
When this is done, a theory that bi–interprets Peano arithmetic is derivable (i.e. is a 
proper sub–theory of the theory thus obtained). G¨odel’s theorem applies to this exten­
sion (Canty 1967). In a sense, those strengthenings can constitute foundational systems 
that Le´sniewski was after. There are some problems, however, which mostly have to do 
with Le´sniewski’s philosophical views. Le´sniewski claimed to be a nominalist. Unless a 
plausible nominalist story about quantiﬁcation in Ontology is told, it is fairly unclear that 
Ontology itself is a nominalistically acceptable tool. Le´sniewski also opposed the idea of 
modifying a system “just to make it work” (that was his main objection against weak­
enings of set theory introduced, as he viewed them, just in order to avoid the Russell’s 
paradox) and he believed that the axioms of his systems correspond to certain essential 
features of reality (he even called them true). That being the case, a question arises as 
to whether postulating the actual existence of inﬁnitely many objects is acceptable in 
this setting. 

Chapter 5 
Le´sniewski’s Mereology 
5.1 Why Mereology? 
Mereology1 was the ﬁrst deductive system developed (around 1916) by Le´sniewski.2 It 
arose from his considerations regarding Russell’s antinomy.3 He wanted to provide an 
alternative system of foundations of mathematics which avoids antinomies without paying 
the prize of dropping intuitively compelling assumptions. In the preface to the ﬁrst 
presentation of his Mereology he writes: 
The present work is the ﬁrst link in an extended series of works, which I 
intend to publish in the near or distant future, desiring to contribute as much 
as possible to the justiﬁcation of modern mathematics . . . The arrangement 
of deﬁnitions and truths, which I established in the present work dedicated 
to the most general problems of the theory of sets, has for me, in comparison 
to other previously known arrangements of deﬁnitions and truths (Zermelo, 
Russell, etc.) this advantage that it eliminates the ‘antinomies’ of the general 
theory of sets without narrowing the original domain of Cantor’s term ‘set’ 
. . . and on the other hand, it does not lead to assertions which are in such 
startling conﬂict with intuitions of the ‘commonalty’. . . (1916: 129–130) 
1The name originates from the ancient Greek and loosely speaking it means ‘a science about parts’. 
2So, historically speaking, it was the ﬁrst theory he constructed, however imperfect formally it was 
at that time. In his endeavor to provide it with a secure logical background theory he later on developed 
Ontology and Protothetic. 
3“I occupied myself zealously with the ‘antinomies’. From the time when in the year 1911 I began 
an acquaintance with them by meeting with the ‘antinomies’ of Russell related to the ‘class of classes 
not elements of themselves’, and problems concerning the antinomies were the most demanding subject 
of my deliberations for over eleven years.” (1927: 199)

141 
The basic idea behind Mereology is that a collection of material objects is nothing 
more than a concrete whole consisting of those objects taken together. That is, for 
example, that the mereological class of stones in a given heap is nothing more than the 
heap itself. 
In the early stage of the development of set-theory the informal explanations of what 
a set is indeed might have suggested this reading. For example, Cantor says: 
Any set of distinct things can be regarded as a single thing in which those 
objects are constituents or constitutive elements.4 
Here, examples of objects standing in the relation of constitution are: (a) particular 
sounds and the whole musical composition, (b) a picture and its suitably matched parts.5 
As we have already seen (in section 2.7.4), mereological intuitions about classes were 
already used by Le´sniewski when he dealt with Russell’s paradox in (1914a). At that 
time, however, he did not use any axiomatization of his theory of parthood. Only in 
1916 he took the ﬁrst stab at constructing such a system. Technically speaking, it was 
far from perfect. There were axioms, deﬁnitions, theorems and proofs, but he did not go 
far with formalization. He did use something like name variables, but everything else was 
stated using natural language. Also, the logic underlying his proofs was not explicitly 
formulated. Strictly speaking, while publishing on Mereology, Le´sniewski never went 
much further in the level of formalization.6 Only in later papers did he ﬁll in the gap by 
4“Jede 
Menge 
wohlunterschiedener 
Dinge 
kann 
als 
ein 
einheithliches 
Ding 
f¨ur 
sich 
angesehen werden, 
in welchem jene Dinge Bestandteile oder constitutive Elemente sind.” 
(my translation of Cantor 1877: 83) 
5Considering the way the development of Cantor’s set-theory went it seems that Cantor did not 
understand sets mereologically. The point is, however, that in the early years of set theory, informal 
explanations were not precise enough to exclude this interpretation. 
6In his last paper on Mereology he does suggest abbreviating some name-forming functors, but 
the proofs and theorems are still stated quite informally (1931a). Still, it deserves the name of a 
formalization because he introduces axioms and deﬁnitions, which even though contain certain natural 
language expressions, like ‘is a part of’ or ‘is’ are formulated in quite a regimented language. He also 
proves that certain other expressions which he calls theorems follow from these axioms and deﬁnitions. 
Even though he had not formulated clearly his rules of inference by that time, his proofs were quite 
regimented and detailed. In a way, they look very much like an applied system of natural deduction 

142 
introducing two logical systems (Protothetic and Ontology) in which his prior informal 
reasonings can be formalized. 
His construction was meant to not only adhere to the view that identiﬁes classes with 
what we would nowadays call ‘mereological fusions’. It was also intended to accommodate 
some claims that Le´sniewski considered intuitive. 
First of all, he considered the existence of the empty set highly dubious. Basically, 
the empty set seemed for him to be something invented or introduced on the grounds of 
expedience (mainly in order to make the set product operation uniform and executable for 
any sets).7 On the other hand, Le´sniewski took the Cantorian deﬁnition quite seriously. 
If any set is constituted from its elements, then whenever there is nothing that constitutes 
it, the set itself does not exist.8 
Second, he did not recognize the distinction between an object and the singleton 
constituted by this object. Here it is important to make a distinction between two 
readings of the claim that an object is identical with its singleton. In the ﬁrst reading, 
(e.g. to prove a conditional he assumes the antecedent and proves the consequent; to prove a conditional 
within the scope of a universal quantiﬁer he freezes the relevant variable(s), assumes the antecedent and 
proves the consequent). 
7For example, Fraenkel says: “On purely formal grounds, namely to be able to express certain facts 
more easily and more conveniently, we introduce at this point a further improper set, the so-called null-
set. This is deﬁned as containing no element whatever; it is therefore in virtue of the deﬁnition from 
page 4 not a set at all, but it will on the ground of a special appointment and by an extension of that 
deﬁnition, will be counted as one (indeed as a ﬁnite one) and will be designated by 0.” (my translation of 
?: 21) Also in a more modern text Fraenkel, Bar-Hillel and Levy suggest that the reason for postulating 
the empty set is practical: “The practical reasons which call for the existence of an individual are as 
follows. When we deﬁne the intersection of two sets r and s to be the set t which consists of those 
elements which belong to both r and s, we want the intersection to be deﬁned even in the case where r 
and s have no members in common. In this case the intersection t has to be a memberless element, i.e. 
an individual. There are also many other examples where the existence of a memberless element makes 
things simpler. The same practical reasons which call for the existence of such an element also call for 
using always the same element for the intersection of any two sets r and s with no members in common, 
and for referring to this element as a set. Therefore we shall call this element the null-set and our sets 
are, from now on, the elements which have members as well as the null set. Let us, however, stress 
at this point that whereas the existence of at least one individual is required for serious philosophical 
reasons, referring to one of the individuals as the null-set is done only for reasons of convenience and 
simplicity, and can be regarded as a mere notational convention.”(Fraenkel et al. 1973: 24) 
8“Being of the opinion that, if an object is the class of some a . . . then it actually consists of a, I 
always rejected . . . the existence of theoretical monstrosities like the class of square circles, understanding 
only too well that nothing can consist of something which does not even exist.” (1927: 214) 

143 
accepted by Le´sniewski, if a name m names exactly one object x, then the expression 
‘the class of m’ also names exactly one object, namely x itself. However, Le´sniewski 
did not accept the view that for any object x, x is a class k such that any object y 
which is an element of k is identical with the object x. The ﬁrst claim is in accordance 
with the mereological account of classes. The second (insofar as we accept Le´sniewski’s 
identiﬁcation of being an element with being a part9) goes against it. For indeed, if the 
class of stones in a heap is the heap itself, and whatever is a part of it is its element, then 
being its element does not entail being a stone. The same holds for a singleton. Let us 
name a speciﬁc chosen stone ‘Frank’. Now, the class of Frank is Frank itself. It is not the 
case, however, than any part of Frank is Frank, and thus, Frank (although he in a sense 
is a singleton) has some elements which are diﬀerent than itself.10 Interestingly, every 
mereological class can also be viewed as singleton, relative to the name of itself. So for 
example, the class of humans is the mereological whole composed of all people. But the 
class of the class of humans is a singleton, in the sense that it is the class of a, where a is 
a singular term. This also indicates that using the term ‘singleton’ in this loose, relative 
sense is not useful. On the other hand, one can say that a singleton is a class which has 
a unique element. But in this sense, the fact that a class is the class of a’s, where a is a 
singular term is not suﬃcient for this class to be a singleton (although it is a necessary 
condition). What is suﬃcient is that the object which generates the class have no parts, 
that is, is an atom. 
Third, Le´sniewski neither believed in the existence of abstract objects nor did he 
think he understood in the slightest explanations that employed ‘extensions of concepts’, 
9More technically, with being an ingredient. I will discuss the details of this identiﬁcation later. 
10This issue touches upon another interesting features of mereological classes. They have cardinality 
relative to countable noun phrases. The question ‘how many objects does the heap of stones consist of?’ 
is as diﬃcult to answer as the question ‘how many parts does this heap have?’. On the other hand, the 
question like ‘how many stones does it consist of?’ seems much easier to answer. 

144 
‘concepts’ or ‘courses of values of functions’.11 
Also, Le´sniewski somewhat objected to the philosophical underpinnings of White­
head’s and Russell’s no-class theory. Basically, the no-class theory in Principia Mathe­
matica takes the symbols for classes to be incomplete symbols, just like deﬁnite descrip­
tions, and provides a way of reducing expressions containing them to expressions which 
do not contain symbols for classes. This statement and the philosophical justiﬁcation of 
this approach to be found in Principia Mathematica is: 
The symbols for classes, like those for descriptions, are, in our system, incom­
plete symbols: their uses are deﬁned, but they themselves are not assumed 
to mean anything at all. That is to say, the uses of such symbols are so 
deﬁned that, when the deﬁniens is substituted for the deﬁniendum, there no 
longer remains any symbols which could be supposed to represent a class. 
Thus classes, so far as we introduce them, are merely symbolic or linguistic 
conveniences, not genuine objects as their members are if they are individuals. 
It is an old dispute whether formal logic should concern itself mainly with in­
tensions or with extensions. In general, logicians whose training was mainly 
philosophical have decided for intensions, while those whose training was 
11“I will not attempt here to submit Frege’s conception which treats classes as ‘extensions of concepts’ 
to analytic assessment because, despite my best eﬀorts in this direction, I am still unable to understand 
what the various authors are saying when they use the expression ‘extension of a concept’. If the 
‘extension of concept a’ is not to be the class of objects a consisting of objects a in accordance with my 
conception of classes, then, being unable to answer my own question as to what this ‘extension of concept 
a’ could be and when and where one could become acquainted with such an ‘extension’ and whether 
anything like it exists in the world, I am none the less inclined to surmise meekly that it is simply an 
object ‘devised’ by logicians for the annoyance of many generations. I am no more able to understand 
Frege’s utterance . . . that the ‘extension of a concept’ “attaches to the concept itself and to it alone”, 
than I am the most obscure enunciation of the exponents of ‘romantic philosophy’, which simply means 
that I do not understand the utterance at all. The declaration, according to which “With such functions 
whose value is always a truth-value, we can say ‘extension of the concept’ instead of ‘course of values 
of the function’ and it seems appropriate to call directly a concept, a function whose value is always 
a truth-value” does nothing to clarify for me the question of the ‘extensions of concepts’ because the 
expression ‘course of values of the function’ is no more intelligible to me than the expression ‘extension 
of the concept’.” (1927: 219–220) 

145 
mainly mathematical have decided for extensions. The facts seem to be that, 
while mathematical logic requires extensions, philosophical logic refuses to 
supply anything except intensions. Our theory of classes recognizes and rec­
onciles these two apparently opposite facts, by showing that an extension 
(which is the same as a class) is an incomplete symbol, whose use always 
acquires its meaning through a reference to intension. 
In the case of descriptions, it was possible to prove that they are incomplete 
symbols. In the case of classes, we do not know of any equally deﬁnite proof, 
though arguments of more or less cogency can be elicited from the ancient 
problem of the One and the Many? . It is not necessary for our purposes, 
however, to assert dogmatically, that there are no such things as classes. It is 
only necessary for us to show that the incomplete symbols which we introduce 
as representatives of classes yield all the propositions for the sake of which 
classes might be thought essential. (Whitehead and Russell 1910: I, 75–76) 
Roughly, the no-class theory proceeds as follows. If φx is a matrix, we say that 
φxˆ is the name of the function involved in this matrix itself. Functions that involve 
no variables except individuals are called ﬁrst-order functions. Functions which have 
ﬁrst-order functions among their arguments and have no arguments except ﬁrst-order 
functions and individuals are called second-order. In general, a function is n + 1-th order 
(n > 0) if it has at least one function of n-th order among its arguments and no function 
of at least n+1-function among its arguments. A function of order n is called predicative 
if in its deﬁnition only quantiﬁcation over functions of order k < n is employed. The fact 
that φxˆ is predicative is denoted by putting an exclamation mark after φ: φ!ˆx and writing 
correspondingly φ!x for its value. Two propositional functions are said to be formally 
equivalent when any argument which satisﬁes the one satisﬁes the other. A function of 
a function is called extensional when its truth-value with any argument is the same as 

146 
with any formally equivalent argument. All functions introduced in the system of PM 
are extensional. 
The authors also accept the Axiom of Reducibility which states that given any func­
tion φˆ
For functions of one and 
x there is a formally equivalent predicative function. 
two variables it is formulated (Whitehead and Russell 1910: I, 71–72) as (I changed the 
notation slightly): 
∀φ∃ψ∀x(φx ≡ ψ!x) 
∀φ∃ψ∀x,y(φ(x, y) ≡ ψ!(x, y)) 
Now, every propositional function φxˆ determines a class ˆz(φz). If two functions are 
formally equivalent, they determine the same class: 
∀φ,ψ[ˆz(φz) = zˆ(ψz) ≡∀x(φx ≡ ψx)] 
How do Russell and Whitehead reduce the notion of class which satisﬁes the above 
conditions, but also which allows a name of a class to stand as a grammatical subject of 
a sentence to a sentence which does not contain any name of a class? The three relevant 
deﬁnitions are: 
? 20.01 f{zˆ(ψz)} = Df ∃φ[∀x(φ!x ≡ ψx) ∧ f{φ!ˆz}] 
?20.02 ∀φ,x(x ∈ (φ!ˆz) =Df φ!x) 
?20.03 Cls = Df αˆ{∃φα = zˆ(φ!z)} 
The idea is this. If we have a sentence which apparently states something about a class, 
we reduce it using 20.01 to a statement about a predicative function (the existence of 
which is guaranteed by the Axiom of Reducibility). Speciﬁcally, saying that a certain 
predicative function determines a class and an object is an element of this class, by 20.02 
boils down to saying that this function applied to this object yields a true proposition. 
20.03 allows us to use the name ‘class’ itself. 

147 
The star in the quotation is a reference to an argument against the existence of classes 
put forward by Russell. The argument is: 
If there is such an object as a class, it must be in some sense one object. Yet 
it is only of classes that many can be predicated. Hence, if we admit classes 
as objects, we must suppose that the same object can be both one and many, 
which seems impossible. (Whitehead and Russell 1910: I, 72) 
Le´sniewski was quite amazed that the argument has been taken seriously 
(1927: 224–226). It seemed to him that using the word ‘many’ makes sense when it 
is treated as a quantiﬁcational device in the contexts like ‘there are many a’s’ where a 
is a general countable term. But then, there is no single object which has the property 
of being many. On the other hand, for no object x does it make sense to say that x is 
many, because ‘many’ does not express a property that an object can posses.12 
Le´sniewski disagreed also with the no–class theory itself. He believed that the name 
‘class’ has some irreducible use in the natural language. However, he thought it was the 
mereological use: collections of concrete objects are concrete objects, every class is an 
element of itself and being an element is the same as being a part (in the improper sense 
that treats every object as a part of itself). His formalized Mereology was meant to be 
a theory of classes thus understood.13 
12“Despite my sincerest wish, I am unable to treat seriously the thesis which proclaims that, “if we 
admit classes as objects, we must suppose that the same object can be both one and many which seems 
impossible”, as I feel in it some gross misunderstanding: even posito that the expression ‘many’ causes 
no doubts on the theme ‘at least how many?’, I can ﬁnd no sense in saying about some object that it 
is ‘many’ even though, by assuming that the meaning of the expression ‘many’ is not uncertain with 
respect to quantity, that it means e.g., the same as ‘at least two’, I fully understand e.g., the utterance 
that ‘many objects’ exist in the world . . . Seing no sense in the thesis quoted, I cannot regard it as an 
even slightly ‘cogent’ argument for anything at all in the world.” (1927: 225–226) 
13He also admitted a second use, called ‘distributive’, which was similar to that formalized by the 
classical set theory. Even though no published work by Le´sniewski contains this claim (he does not even 
say explicitly that one can make sense of Cantor’s set theory or of the system of Principia when one 
considers this to be the sense they were concerned with), it has been made by competent Le´sniewskian 
scholars (Luschei 1962: 29–32), (Soboci´nski 1949b). 

148 
5.2 Axiomatizations 
I will now describe four axiomatizations of Mereology developed by Le´sniewski. They 
come from (respectively) 1916, 1918, 1920, 1921.14 The ﬁrst axiomatization was ﬁrst 
published in 1928. The axiomatization from 1918 (published in 1930a) resulted from 
Le´sniewski’s discontent with the fact that the axiomatization from 1916 employed deﬁned 
terms in two of its axioms. The 1920 axiomatization (published in ’1930a as well) took 
‘being an ingredient’ (i.e. a proper or an improper part) as the primitive, instead of 
‘being a proper part’ used in previous axiomatization. His axiomatization from 1921 
(published in 1931a) is signiﬁcantly simpler. It takes ‘being exterior’ as the primitive 
and consists of two (as opposed to four) axioms. 
A generally interesting question is why Le´sniewski waited that long with publication of 
his results. This question is hard to answer. My impression is that he was a perfectionist 
and he did not want to publish his results before preparing them for publication a very 
orderly manner resembling the ordering of Principia Mathematica. There is only one 
passage where Le´sniewski comments on this issue, and it rather seems that he tries to 
ﬁnd an excuse for publishing his papers which he does not consider really ready for 
publication rather than explaining why he waited so long. In the beginning of his On the 
Foundations of Mathematics he says: 
The aim of this work is the removal of a painful situation, in which I have 
found myself for a number of years. The situation consists in this, that I 
possess a good many unpublished scientiﬁc results from various areas of the 
foundations of mathematics, that the number of these unpublished results 
continually grows, and since these results inter–relate with each other and 
14The systems are dated based on Le´sniewski’s testimony present in the papers in which he describes 
his systems, which was conﬁrmed by people like Kotarbi´nski with whom Le´sniewski had discussed his 
results long before he published them (see for instance Kotarbi´nski 1929). Also, Le´sniewski had lectured 
on his systems while in Warsaw long before they were actually published. 

149 
with the results of other researchers in these areas, the technical–editorial 
diﬃculties connected with their preparation for publication continually in­
crease. 
While I was trying diﬀerent ways of arranging the scientiﬁc results to which 
I had arrived, I considered among others a systematic–compendium method, 
I took as a model in this connection the well–known work of Whitehead and 
Russell. However, such a task is again spreading over a number of years, and 
it is diﬃcult for me to determine how much time I would still need, in order 
to submit in this way for a wider technical discussion the whole of the results, 
to which I have been led by already more than ten years of reﬂection on the 
foundation of mathematics. 
This painful situation is further complicated by the fact that just as I reached 
some of my views and some scientiﬁc results under the inﬂuence of conver­
sations with my colleagues and in connection with their still unpublished 
scientiﬁc results, so also my views and observations, which I had formulated 
during a number of years in university lectures and in numerous scientiﬁc 
discussions, have contributed to the formation of certain opinions and results 
of my colleagues, who, out of an admirable loyalty towards me, have withheld 
from publication until now a number of their scientiﬁc results, until my own 
related results are published. (Le´sniewski 1927: 174-175). 
5.2.1 1916 axiomatization 
The language in which Mereology was originally formulated was partially informal. How­
ever, for the purpose of presentation I will use Ontology as the logical theory which 
underlies Mereology and I will formalize theorems of Mereology using the language of 

150 
Ontology. Rules of inference of Mereology are the same as that of Ontology.15 In the 
process of formalization it is important to note that ‘a is not b’ and ‘every a is b’ for 
Le´sniewski had existential import. They were respectively equivalent to: ‘a is an object 
and not(a is b)’ and ‘some object is a, and for any X, if X is a, then X is b’. (1928: 230) 
Accordingly, let us use two preliminary deﬁnitions (already given by Le´sniewski): 
∀a,b[a ε ∼ b ≡ a ε a ∧¬a ε b] 
∀a,b[a ⊆ b ≡∀c(c ε a 
c ε b)]
→ 
The system from 1916 had two axioms within which no deﬁned terms occurred and 
two axioms which involved previously deﬁned terms.16 The ﬁrst two axioms introduce 
the notion of part. 
Axiom I ∀a,b(a ε prt(b) → b ε ∼prt(a)) 
that is, if a is a part of b, then b is an object which is not a part of the object a. 
Axiom II ∀a,b,c(a ε prt(b) ∧ b ε prt(c) 
a ε prt(c)))
→ 
This states the transitivity of parthood relation: if a is a part of b and b is a part of c, 
then a is a part of c. 17 
Axiom I indicates that strictly speaking by ‘part’ Le´sniewski understood a proper part, 
that is a part of an object cannot be identical with that very object. For the reﬂexive 
15To avoid indexing variables in the chapter on Mereology I allow all the letters a, b, c, d, e, f, g to be 
name variables. 
16The names of formulas in this paragraph come from the 1916 paper. 
17A few words on the notation. I abbreviated Le´sniewski’s wording of formulas. Instead of ‘for some’ I 
write ‘∃’, instead of ‘for all’ I write ‘∀’. Instead of ‘is’ I write ‘ ε ’. I also sometimes changed the shape of 
brackets. Also, informally, Le´sniewski used capital variables in case when the truth of a formula required 
that a term be singular. Otherwise, the formulas are pretty much the same formulas that Le´sniewski 
gave. So, for instance, originally, Axiom II would read: ‘If P is a part of object Q, and Q is a part of 
object R, then P is a part of object R.’ It is important to remember that he did not have two sorts of 
variables in his oﬃcial language. I decided to increase the degree of formalization for the sake of clarity.

closure of the parthood relation (sometimes called ‘improper parthood’) he introduced 
the term ‘ingredient’,18 deﬁned by: 
Deﬁnition I ∀a,b(a ε ingr(b) ≡ (a ε b ∧ b ε a) ∨ a ε prt(b)) 
which reads: a is an ingredient of b if and only if either a and b are the same object, or 
a is a part of b. 
Two key deﬁnitions are that of a set and that of a class. 
An object a is a set of b if and only if it is an object such that every one of its 
ingredients has an ingredient which is an ingredient of an object which is b: 
Deﬁnition II ∀a,b(a ε set(b) ≡ a ε a ∧∀c(c ε ingr(a) → 
→∃d(d ε ingr(c) ∧∃e(e ε b ∧ d ε ingr(e) ∧ e ε ingr(a))))) 
For instance, the mereological whole constituted, say, by all people in Canada is 
a set of people, because every one of its ingredients is an ingredient of a person (in 
Canada). The indeﬁnite article in ‘is a set’ is there not without a purpose. According 
to this deﬁnition, one countable noun may generate quite a few diﬀerent sets. The 
intuition here is that every mereological whole constituted by some objects b (i.e. by 
some objects denoted by the countable noun phrase ‘b’) is a set of b, although choosing 
diﬀerent representatives (or groups of representatives) of b we get diﬀerent mereological 
wholes. Another example: any heap of stones is a set of stones in the sense introduced 
by Deﬁnition II. Therefore, if a names more than one object, the name set(a) names also 
more than one object: it names any mereological whole constructed from some objects 
that fall under a. 
Another notion deﬁned by Le´sniewski is the one that determines the ‘maximal’ set 
of objects a, that is the set of all a’s. This is the notion of a class, and an object a is a 
class of objects b if and only if every object b is an ingredient of a, and any ingredient of 
18The term is claimed to have been suggested by Mr Lucjan Zarzecki (1928: 230). 

152 
a has an ingredient which is also an ingredient of some object b:19 
Deﬁnition III ∀a,b(a ε Cl(b) ≡ a ε a ∧∀c(c ε b 
c ε ingr(a)) ∧
→ 
∧∀c(c ε ingr(a) →∃d(d ε ingr(c) ∧∃e(e ε b ∧ d ε ingr(e))))) 
The remaining two axioms that employ the notion of class are: 
Axiom III ∀b(∃aa ε b →∃cc ε Cl(b)) 
Axiom III may be meta-linguistically read as stating that any non-empty name generates 
its class. 
Axiom IV ∀a,b,c(a ε Cl(b) ∧ c ε Cl(b) 
a ε c)
→ 
Axiom IV states that a given name generates at most one class. 
5.2.2 1918 axiomatization 
Quite soon Le´sniewski became dissatisﬁed with the fact that his formulation employed 
deﬁned terms in two of its axioms.20 Thus, in 1918 he made a modiﬁcation described 
in his paper (1930a). Deﬁnitions I, II and III and axioms I and II remain untouched. 
Axioms III and IV are replaced by: 
Axiom C ∀a,b,d[b ε b ∧ d ε d →∀c(c ε a 
((c ε b ∧ b ε c) ∨ c ε prt(b))) ∧
→ 
∧∀c(c ε a → ((c ε d ∧ d ε c) ∨ c ε prt(d))) ∧∀e(e ε prt(b) ∨ e ε prt(d) → 
→∃f (((f ε e ∧ e ε f) ∨ f ε prt(d)) ∧ (f ε a ∨∃c(c ε a ∧ f ε prt(c))) 
b ε d]
→ 
Axiom D ∀a[∃cc ε a →∃b(∀d(d ε a → (d ε b ∧ b ε d) ∨ d ε prt(b)) ∧ 
∧∀d(d ε prt(b) →∃c(((c ε d∧d ε c)∨c ε prt(d))∧(c ε a∨∃e(e ε a∧c ε prt(e))))))] 
19Since Cl(a) is the mereological fusion of all those objects that are a, I will use ‘the class of a’ and 
‘the class of a’s’ interchangeably. By the former use I want to emphasize that it is a class determined 
by a single name a and by the latter I want to highlight that it is nothing above and beyond the objects 
that a already denotes, considered as one individual object. 
20Keep in mind that the simplifying your axiomatic system was the name of the game in the days 
when Le´sniewski was constructing his axiomatizations. 

153 
Axiom C looks somewhat complicated, but the sense behind it is not so diﬃcult. 
Informally speaking, it says that if: 
1. b and d are objects (b ε b ∧ d ε d): 
2. any object c which is a is an ingredient of b: 
∀c(c ε a 
((c ε b ∧ b ε c) ∨ c ε prt(d)))
→ 
(by Deﬁnition I, c is an ingredient of b iﬀ either it is identical to b (c ε b ∧ b ε c), or 
it is a part of d.) 
3. any a is an ingredient of d: 
∀c(c ε a → ((c ε d ∧ d ε c) ∨ c ε prt(d))) 
4. any part of either b or d: 
∀e(e ε prt(b) ∨ e ε prt(d) → 
has an ingredient: 
∃f (((f ε e ∧ e ε f) ∨ f ε prt(d))∧ 
which either is a 
(f ε a∨ 
or is a part of one of a’s: 
∃c(c ε a ∧ f ε prt(c))) 
then b is d (b ε d). 
Axiom D (when we introduce the notion of ingredient using deﬁnition I) may be read 
as stating that if at least one object is a, then there is an object such that all objects a 
are its ingredients and every part of it has an ingredient which is an a or an ingredient 
of an a. In other words: if at least one object is a, then there is a class of objects a. 

154 
This formulation is not deeply innovative. It is easy to see that axiom D results from 
axiom III if we eliminate from it the notions of ingredient and class using deﬁnitions I and 
III. For Axiom III says that for any b, if there is an a such that a ε b (i.e. b is non–empty), 
there is an object which is a class of b’s (I used the indeﬁnite article because the axiom 
does not imply that such a class is unique). When we use Deﬁnition III, the consequent 
of Axiom III reads: 
∃c[c ε c ∧∀d(d ε b 
d ε ingr(c)) ∧∀d(d ε ingr(c) →∃e(e ε ingr(d) ∧
→ 
∧∃f (f ε b ∧ e ε ingr(f))))] 
(5.1) 
Now, using Deﬁnition I we replace every expression of the form α ε ingr(β) with 
(α ε β ∧β ε α)∨α ε prt(β), and we get a formula which pretty much is Axiom D. The only 
diﬀerence is that it contains c ε c in the consequent. This, however, is logically redundant, 
because ∃aa ε b together with ∀d(d ε b 
d ε ingr(c)) already imply ∃dd ε ingr(c) which 
→ 
can be true only if c is a singular term, that is only if c ε c. 
Axiom C is a fairly simple reformulation of axiom IV. For Axiom IV states that if 
two objects are both classes of b’s, they are one and the same object. Axiom D on the 
other hand, says that if there are two individuals b and d such that both b and d have all 
a’s as its ingredients and none of them has an ingredient which is neither a nor a part of 
an object which is a, b and d are the same objects. But this antecedent is true exactly 
when both b and d are classes (mereological fusions) of all the a’s. 
5.2.3 1920 axiomatization 
In (1930a) Le´sniewski discussed a formulation of Mereology dating from 1920 which takes 
‘is an ingredient’ as a primitive term. This formulation is equivalent to the previous 
formulations. It has four axioms: 
Axiom (a) ∀a,b(a ε ingr(b) ∧¬b ε a → b ε ∼a) 

155 
Axiom (b) ∀a,b,c(a ε ingr(b) ∧ b ε ingr(c) 
a ε ingr(c))
→ 
Axiom (c) ∀a,c,d[∀b(b ε a 
b ε ingr(c) ∧ b ε ingr(d)) ∧
→ 
∧∀b(b ε ingr(c) ∨ b ε ingr(d) →∃e(e ε ingr(b) ∧ 
∧∃f,g(f ε ingr(g) ∧ g ε a ∧ e ε ingr(f)))) 
c ε d]
→ 
Axiom (d) ∀a[∃cc ε a →∃b(∀d(d ε a → d ε ingr(b)) ∧ 
∧∀d(d ε ingr(b) →∃c(c ε ingr(d) ∧∃e(e ε a ∧ c ε ingr(e)))))] 
and parthood is deﬁned by: 
Deﬁnition (e) ∀a,b(a ε prt(b) ≡ a ε ingr(b) ∧¬(a ε b ∧ b ε a)) 
The deﬁnition of class is the same as Deﬁnition III in the version from 1916. 
Again, there seems to be nothing essentially new about this formulation. It takes 
another expression as a primitive, but the reformulation of its axioms is a quite straight­
forward translation of axioms occurring in previous formulations. And so, axiom (a), 
given deﬁnition (e), has the same intuitive content as axiom I. Axiom (b), considering 
the same deﬁnition easily implies Axiom II. Indeed, axiom (b) seems just to be ‘a reﬂex­
ive closure’ of the assumption of transitivity from axiom II. Axiom (c) is just another 
formulation of the extensionality statement, present already in axiom IV. Axiom (d), if 
we use deﬁnition III turns out to boil down to axiom IV. 
5.2.4 1921 axiomatization 
In (1931a) Le´sniewski discusses another, equivalent formulation which takes ‘exterior 
to’ as a primitive. Two objects are exterior to each other if and only if they have no 
overlapping parts.21 There are two axioms: 
21What he published in 1931 is nevertheless referred to as the 1921 axiomatization, since this seems 
to be the year when it was formulated. This diﬀerence arose from the fact that Le´sniewski lingered with 
the publication of his results. 

156 
Axiom A ∀a,b[a ε ext(b) ≡∀c(c ε c → 
→∃d((d ε ext(a) ∨ d ε ext(b)) ∧ d ε ∼ext(c)))] 
Axiom B ∀a,φ[∀b[b ε φ(a) ≡ b ε b ∧∃dd ε a ∧ 
∧∀c(b ε ext(c) ≡∀d(d ε a → d ε ext(c)))] → 
→ φ(a) ε φ(a)] 
Axiom A can be read as saying that two objects, a and b are exterior to each other 
if and only if for any object c there is an object d which overlaps with c but which does 
not overlap with either a or b. To grasp intuitively why the equivalence holds, consider 
the following. From right to left. Suppose a and b are not exterior to each other. This 
means that they have a common part. Call it c. But then, there is no d overlapping with 
c which does not overlap with a and b. For the opposite direction, suppose there is a c 
such that any d which overlaps with c, overlaps both with a and b. This means that c is 
a common ingredient of a and b and hence, a and b overlap. 
Axiom B may be taken to state that if something is a, then there is a class of a’s. 
Here is a short explanation why. Basically what it says is this. Suppose you deﬁne a 
name–forming functor of one name argument, φ, by saying that it names any object b 
such that (a) if an object c is exterior to all the a’s, b is exterior to c, and (b) if b is 
exterior to an object c, then c is exterior to all the a’s. Part (a) means that b has no 
ingredient outside of the fusion of the a’s. Part (b) means that there is no part of the 
fusion of all the a’s which is exterior to b. Together, they mean that b is the maximal 
object which has all a’s as its ingredients. That is, b is their fusion. So, given that ‘φ(a)’ 
is deﬁned as ‘the fusion of a’s’, Axiom B says that if a itself is non–empty then there is 
exactly one fusion of a’s (‘φ(a) ε φ(a)’ is true only if there is exactly one object denoted 
by ‘φ(a)’). 
There are a few deﬁned name–forming functors of name arguments: 

157 
Deﬁnition C ∀b,a[b ε Cl(a) ≡ b ε b ∧∀c(b ε ext(c) ≡∀d(d ε a 
d ε ext(c)))]
→ 
This reads: b is a class of a’s iﬀ b is an object and it is external to an object c if and 
only if this object is external to all the a’s. It is easy to see that this deﬁniens occurs in 
Axiom B. 
Deﬁnition D ∀a,b[a ε ingr(b) ≡∃c(b ε Cl(c) ∧ a ε c)] 
This deﬁnition says that an object a is an ingredient of an object b if and only if for 
some c, b is a class of c’s and a is one of the c’s. The parthood relation is deﬁned as in 
Deﬁnition (e). 
This axiomatization interestingly diverges from the previous ones and the proof of 
their equivalence (given by Le´sniewski in the same paper) is not really trivial. 
5.2.5 Some other necessary and suﬃcient conditions of being a class 
K. Kuratowski and A. Tarski formulated three other possible deﬁnitions of class, equiv­
alent to the one used originally by Le´sniewski. These results are described in (1930a). 
Kuratowski’s deﬁnition is: 
Deﬁnition a ∀a,b[b ε Cl(a) ≡∀c(c ε a 
c ε ingr(b)) ∧
→ 
∧∀c(∀d(d ε a → d ε ingr(c)) ∧ c ε ingr(b) → b ε c ∧ c ε b)))] 
Two deﬁnitions suggested by Tarski are: 
Deﬁnition b ∀a,b[b ε Cl(a) ≡∀c(c ε a 
c ε ingr(b)) ∧
→ 
∧∀c(∀d(d ε a → d ε ingr(c)) → b ε ingr(c)))] 
Deﬁnition c ∀a,b[b ε Cl(a) ≡ b ε b ∧∀c(∀d(d ε a → 
→ d ε ingr(c) ≡ b ε ingr(c)))] 

158 
5.3 Mereology as a replacement for Set Theory 
Le´sniewski intended to develop Mereology as an alternative to classical set theory. In 
the series of papers in which he described various axiomatizations of Mereology he also 
proved numerous theorems that are intended as analogues of certain theorems of set 
theory. Although his proofs are not wholly formalized, they are clear enough to see 
that they can be fully formalized. Also, an interesting aspect of Le´sniewski’s proofs 
in Mereology is that he clearly uses a strategy typical for natural deduction (freezing 
variables, assuming the antecedent and proving the consequent in order to prove the 
whole conditional), even though the oﬃcial deductive system developed by him does not 
allow for this kind of moves. Nowadays it is a common practice, but those days it stood 
in clear contrast with the more common strategy of proving theorems within a system in 
the Hilbert-style fashion.22 
I will now give and describe those theorems of Mereology proven by Le´sniewski which 
are crucial for one of his stronger theorems in Mereology, an analogue of Cantor’s the­
orem.23 This analogue states that if a name names more than one object, and is such 
that if the objects it names do not overlap, then there are more sets of objects which 
are a than there are objects a. Going over a few theorems on our way will also help us 
understand the expressive power of the language of Mereology. Simultaneously I will also 
discuss those theorems which show how Mereology diﬀers from set theory. For the sake of 
accessibility I replace proofs given by Le´sniewski with informal explanations. Numbering 
of the following theorems and deﬁnitions has nothing to do with the names assigned by 
Le´sniewski. For theorems proven by Le´sniewski I provide references in footnotes. 
22It is said that Le´sniewski eventually became dissatisﬁed with Mereology as a system of foundations 
of mathematics. He did not publish such a comment anywhere, and the information seems to come from 
secondary sources. For instance (Kearns 1962: 35) says: “Le´sniewski did not give up his claims that it 
[Mereology] is intuitively acceptable, but he did realize that it cannot replace set theory.” 
23Almost all theorems have been given and proven by Le´sniewski. Only occasionally will I give fairly 
trivial consequences of his theorems which have not been formulated by him. 

159 
Among some simple theorems which involve the notions of parthood and ingredient 
are: 
∀a(a ε a → a ε ¬prt(a)) 
(5.2) 
which states that no object is part of itself.24 It easily follows from Axiom I. 
∀a(a ε a → a ε ingr(a)) 
(5.3) 
that is, every object is an ingredient of itself. 25 Deﬁnition I implies:26 
∀a,b(a ε prt(b) 
a ε ingr(b)) 
(5.4)
→ 
which means that every part of an object is also its ingredient. Also, the relation of being 
an ingredient is transitive: 27 
∀a,b,c(a ε ingr(b) ∧ b ε ingr(c) 
a ε ingr(c)) 
(5.5)
→ 
If one object is an ingredient of another object, they have at least one ingredient in 
common:28 
∀a,b(a ε ingr(b) →∃c(c ε ingr(a) ∧ c ε ingr(b))) 
(5.6) 
Also, if an object a is an ingredient of another object b, then it has an ingredient which 
is an ingredient of an ingredient of b:29 
∀a,b(a ε ingr(b) →∃d(d ε ingr(b) ∧∃c(c ε ingr(a) ∧ c ε ingr(d)))) 
(5.7) 
Given a Le´sniewskian understanding of the notions of class and set, clearly every class 
is a set:30 
∀a,b(a ε Cl(b) 
a ε set(b)) 
(5.8)
→ 
24This is Theorem I from (Le´sniewski 1916: 131). Also proven as Theorem I in (Le´sniewski 1928: 
232). 
25Theorem II, (Le´sniewski 1916: 132). Also, Theorem II in (Le´sniewski 1928: 233). 
26Theorem III, (Le´sniewski 1916: 132). 
27Theorem IV, (Le´sniewski 1916: 132). Theorem IV in (Le´sniewski 1928: 234).

29Theorem VI, (Le´sniewski 1916: 134). 
30Theorem VII, (Le´sniewski 1916: 136). 

160 
Every object is the class of its own ingredients:31 
∀a(a ε a → a ε Cl(ingr(a))) 
(5.9) 
and whatever has a part is the class of its own parts:32 
∀b(∃aa ε prt(b) → b ε Cl(prt(a))) 
(5.10) 
The identiﬁcation of a singleton with its element which was mentioned before is also 
provable, and in symbols it looks as follows:33 
(a ε a 
a ε Cl(a)) 
(5.11)
→ 
The deﬁnition of being an element abides by the intuition that for a to be an element of 
a class b there has to be some c, such that b is the class of c, and a is c: 
Def. (el) ∀a,b[a ε el(b) ≡∃c(b ε Cl(c) ∧ a ε c)] 
Interestingly, if a is an ingredient of b, then by (5.9) there is a name ingr(b) such that 
b ε Cl(ingr(b)) and a ε ingr(b), and thus a is an element of b:34 
∀a,b(a ε ingr(b) 
a ε el(b)) 
(5.12)
→ 
Also, if a is an element of b, then there is some c such that b ε Cl(c) and a ε b, and thus a 
is an ingredient of b (for, by deﬁnition III, if b is Cl(c), then every c is its ingredient):35 
∀a,b[a ε el(b) 
a ε ingr(b)] 
(5.13)
→ 
Theorems (5.12) and (5.13) together identify being an element of a class with being 
its ingredient. This identiﬁcation implies the reﬂexivity and transitivity of being an

element:36 
∀a(a ε a → a ε el(a)) 
(5.14) 
∀a,b,c(a ε el(b) ∧ b ε el(c) → a ε el(c)) 
(5.15) 
The class of sets of b is the class of b’s:37 
∀a,b(a ε Cl(set(b)) 
a ε Cl(b)) 
(5.16)
→ 
Any set of b is an ingredient of the class of b’s:38 
∀a,b(a ε set(b) 
a ε ingr(Cl(b))) 
(5.17)
→ 
Any class of b’s is a class of sets of b’s:39 
∀a,b(a ε Cl(b) 
a ε Cl(set(b))) 
(5.18)
→ 
From (5.8) and the identiﬁcation of being an ingredient with being an element it follows 
that every object is the class of its elements:40 
∀a(a ε a → a ε Cl(el(a)))) 
(5.19) 
Theorem (5.14) implies that every object is an element of itself. Note also that for 
any a there is at most one class of a’s: 
∀a,b,c(a ε Cl(c) ∧ b ε Cl(c) 
a ε b) 
(5.20)
→ 
Now, if a is a class of b’s, it is unique. Thus, being an object, by (5.14) it is an element 
of itself. That is, every class has at least one element: itself.41 
∀a,b(a ε Cl(b) 
a ε el(a))

Therefore, there is no empty class. 
¬∃a∀b¬b ε el(a) 
(5.22) 
One can deﬁne a name: ‘a class which is not an element of itself’: 
Def. (R) ∀a[a ε R ≡ a ε a ∧¬a ε el(a) ∧∃ba ε Cl(b)] 
The class of classes which are not elements of themselves would be Cl(R). But, since 
every class is an element of itself and no class is empty, Cl(R) does not exist:42 
¬∃aa ε Cl(R) 
(5.23) 
The notions of subset and proper subset are deﬁned as follows: 
Def. (subset) ∀a,b(a ε subset(b) ≡ a ε a ∧∀c(c ε el(a) 
c ε el(b))) 
→ 
Def. (psubset) ∀a,b(a ε psubset(b) ≡ a ε subset(b) ∧¬b ε a) 
Those notions are not very fascinating, though:43 
∀a,b(a ε subset(b) ≡ a ε ingr(b)) 
(5.24) 
∀a,b(a ε psubset(b) ≡ a ε prt(b)) 
(5.25) 
∀a,b(a ε subset(b) ≡ a ε el(b)) 
(5.26) 
It is also possible to deﬁne ‘the universe’. First, we have to deﬁne the name ‘object’: 
Def. (obj) ∀a(a ε obj ≡ a ε a) 
and now we say that the universe is the class of all objects:44 
Def. (U) ∀a(a ε U ≡ a ε a ∧ a ε Cl(obj)) 
42A slight reformulation of Theorem XXVI, (Le´sniewski 1916: 150). 
43These are obvious consequences of Theorems XXVIII–XXXI, (Le´sniewski 1916: 152–155). 
44Deﬁnition VII, (Le´sniewski 1916: 159). 

163 
In the ﬁrst paper on Mereology (1916) there is an interesting confusion which shows 
that Le´sniewski was not clear as to the logical foundations of his system. Theorem XLIII 
(Le´sniewski 1916: 159) claims that some object is the class of non-contradictory objects. 
The informal proof is: 
In agreement with the law of non-contradiction we may state that every object 
is a non-contradictory object. It follows from this that some object is a non­
contradictory object, from which — in accordance with Axiom III — the 
given theorem results. (1916: 159) 
Theorem XLIV (p. 160) states that the class of non-contradictory objects is the universe. 
Neither XLIII nor XLIV actually are theorems of Mereology. They both imply that 
there exists at least one object. However, in the empty domain all axioms of Ontology and 
Mereology are valid and all rules are truth–preserving (or, in other words, the axiomatic 
basis of Le´sniewski’s systems does not contain unconditional existential statements).45 
So, the alleged Theorems XLIII and XLIV imply something that Mereology does not 
imply. 
In formulations other than that from 1921 the notion of being external can be deﬁned 
as follows:46 
Def. (ext) ∀a,b(a ε ext(b) ≡ a ε a ∧∀c(c ε ingr(b) 
c ε ingr(a)))
→¬
The notion of relative complement is also deﬁnable:47 
Def. (compl) ∀a,b,c[a ε compl(b, c) ≡ b ε subset(c) ∧∃d(a ε Cl(d) ∧ 
∧∀e(e ε d ≡ e ε el(c) ∧ e ε ext(b)))] 
45See (Simons 1995) for a proof. 
46Deﬁnition VIII, (Le´sniewski 1916: 161). 
47Deﬁnition IX, (Le´sniewski 1916: 162). 

164 
Clearly, if a is a part of b, then there is a’s complement relative to b:48 
∀a,b(a ε prt(b) →∃c(c ε compl(a, b))) 
(5.27) 
Some other theorems that relate the notions of parthood and complement are:49 
∀a,b,c(a ε compl(b, c)

Theorem (5.30) may look surprising, so a few words about its validity. Notice that 
Def. (compl) says that for a to be a complement of b with respect to c, b has to be 
a fusion of some of the objects named by c, and a has to be the fusion of those objects 
which are named by c but are external to b. So b has to be a subset of c. But being a 
subset of c in Le´sniewski’s sense implies being a part of c as well. 
Also, no object is a complement of itself with respect to any class, neither is it the 
complement of a class with respect to itself, and no class is the complement of a class 
with respect to that class:50 
¬∃a,ba ε compl(a, b) 
(5.31) 
¬∃a,ba ε compl(b, a) 
(5.32) 
¬∃a,ba ε compl(b, b) 
(5.33) 
Another interesting notion is the notion of a sum of two exterior objects:51 
Def. (+) ∀a,b,c[a ε b + c ≡ a ε Cl(b ∪ c) ∧ b ε ext(c)]

Probably the most interesting theorem of Mereology given by Le´sniewski the one that 
corresponds to Cantor’s theorem in classical set theory. To be able to formulate it, we 
ﬁrst have to deﬁne two Ontological concepts: equinumerosity and ‘being fewer than’.55 
First, objects a are as numerous as objects b (a ' b) iﬀ there is some constant τ of 
category n
n such that: 
∀c(c ε a →∃d(d ε b ∧ d ε τ(c))) 
(5.36) 
∀d(d ε b →∃c(c ε a ∧ d ε τ(c))

∀c,d,e(c ε a ∧ d ε b ∧ e ε b ∧ c ε τ (d) ∧ e ε τ(d) 
c ε d ∧ d ε c) 
(5.39)
→ 
Second: objects a are fewer than objects b iﬀ: 
∃c∀d(d ε c 
d ε b ∧ a ' c

→ 
52Theorem CLIII, (Le´sniewski 1929b: 296). 
53Theorem CLV, (Le´sniewski 1929b: 297). 
54Deﬁnition IX, (Le´sniewski 1929b: 302). 
55Those are explained in footnote 14, (Le´sniewski 1929b: 311). 

166 
that is, if a is equinumerous to a certain name c which is weakly included in b, and 
∀c(∀d(d ε c jtd ε a) →¬b ' c) 
(5.41) 
that is, b is not equinumerous to any name c which is weakly included in a. 
If we write ‘objects a are fewer than objects b’ as ‘a < b’, the theorem in question 
is:56 
∀a[∀b,c(b ε a ∧ c ε a → c ε b ∨ c ε ext(b)) ∧ 
∧∃b,c(b ε a ∧ c ε a ∧¬b ε c) 
a < set(a)] 
(5.42) 
→ 
What this states may intuitively be grasped as follows. Let a be a ‘discrete’ name, 
that is, if it names more than one object, those objects have no parts in common. If, 
moreover, the name names more than one object, then there are more sets of a than 
objects a. For example, suppose that ‘a’ names exactly two stones: b and c. Suppose b 
and c are external to each other. How many objects a are there? Two. How many sets 
of a are there? At least three: b itself, c itself and the fusion of b and c is a set of a. Is, 
say, a half of b a set of a? No. According to deﬁnition II, any set of a has to have at least 
one object a as its ingredient. How about the fusion of b and a half of c? If it was a set 
of a, then every ingredient of it would have to have one ingredient e such that e would 
have been an ingredient of an ingredient of one of the a’s, which would also have to be 
an ingredient of this fusion itself. But the half of c is not an ingredient of an ingredient 
of any object a which is an ingredient of the fusion in question. So, it seems, there are 
exactly three sets of a and only two objects a. 
Mereology was constructed by Le´sniewski, as he explicitly stated, to provide an al­
ternative form of the foundation of mathematics. This new system indeed provides an 
interesting theory of classes, at least in one sense of this word. 
56Theorem CXCVIII, (Le´sniewski 1929b: 313). 

167 
Unfortunately, neither Le´sniewski nor later developments have shown that Mereology 
actually constitutes a foundation of mathematics in any sense remotely similar to that 
in which classical set theory does. The last theorem of this section is probably the most 
mathematically interesting theorem of Mereology that Le´sniewski has proven. On the 
other hand, some quasi-mathematical concepts, like equinumerosity, are already deﬁn­
able in Ontology. Le´sniewskian scholars sometimes put it by saying that number is an 
Ontological concept. 
What exactly would Mereology have to be like to succeed as a system of foundations 
of mathematics, or at least as a replacement for set theory? Considering the importance 
of classical set theory nowadays I would conjecture that Mereology would be successful if 
(a) a theory isomorphic with one of standard set theories were a sub–theory of Mereology 
(or of a nominalistically acceptable extension of it), and yet (b) Mereology would not 
be committed to abstract objects. Restriction (b) results from Le´sniewski’s nominalis­
tic assumptions. Restriction (a) is not exactly Le´sniewskian. Of course, from what we 
know, he attempted to prove mereological analogues of certain theorems of the standard 
set theory. So, if we wanted to be more in accordance with Le´sniewski’s intuitions, we 
should require that Mereology be able to prove analogues of major theorems of set the­
ory. The problem with this formulation is that the notion of a mereological analogue of 
a set–theoretic theorem is fairly vague. I would suggest (a) as a nowadays reasonable 
requirement for quite simple pragmatic reasons. There have been thousands of mathe­
maticians who believe set theory makes sense and who use set theory in their everyday 
research practice. Of course, one can go ahead and say that this theory simply does 
not make sense and people who are using it are all mistaken, but this would be quite a 
strong claim. Rather, I am inclined to believe, considering the abundance of set theoretic 
content in various meta–logical and mathematical contexts, one of the tasks of a person 
who constructs a foundational system is to explain the meaning of the theory, not to try 

168 
to explain the theory away. Hence, if one starts with saying that, for instance, it does 
not even make sense to use the expression ‘the empty set’ instead of trying to explain 
how it is possible that this expression makes sense, one puts forward a very revolutionary 
approach to the problems. 
Such a revolutionary strategy might be suspected of not being a foundations of mathe­
matics itself, but rather an attempt to construct a wholly new mathematical theory. The 
issue here resembles the qualms concerning intuitionism raised by Chihara. In a way, 
Heyting, who views the existence assertions of classical mathematics as very metaphys­
ical and vague, can be interpreted as putting forward a program which simply banishes 
such assertions from mathematics. Heyting constructs a logical system in which the ex­
istential quantiﬁer is accounted for in terms of assertability conditions (‘∃xP (x)’ can be 
asserted only if one can specify a mathematical object o of which it can be truly said that 
P (o)). Chihara suggests that ‘Intuitionism is not so much a philosophy of mathematics 
as it is the construction of a new kind of mathematics’ (Chihara 1990: 22). He says: 
. . . philosophy of mathematics is, and should be, directed at understanding 
actual mathematics, and dealing with the philosophical problems arising out 
of the enormous role (actual) mathematics plays in everyday life and in sci­
ence. When Heyting turned his back on classical mathematics and gave up 
trying to understand classical mathematical assertions, he in eﬀect gave up 
philosophy of mathematics! (Chihara 1990: 23) 
In a similar manner, if one simply disregards set theory and thinks of Mereology as 
the correct theory of classes, it seems that one no longer is concerned with foundations 
of what nowadays is classical mathematic, but rather one intends to develop a wholly 
diﬀerent theory whose foundational role is quite unclear. 
This does not mean that Mereology as a separate theory is useless. It turned out 
to be interesting in quite a few diﬀerent ﬁelds: linguists sometimes use it when they 

169 
discuss semantics of mass terms and philosophers speak of parts when they speak about 
persistence, perdurance and other issues discussed in modern metaphysics. 
5.4 (Annotated) further readings 
Among the papers concerned with Mereology it is possible to distinguish a few groups. 
Some of them constitute either an introduction or a philosophical discussion of the system. 
Others contain mostly results obtained within the axiomatic system of Mereology. Some 
are concerned with properties of Mereology as a logical system — among those a special 
role is played by papers whose authors discuss the novelty of Mereology. Its critics claim 
that the system is very similar to other know systems and its advocates emphasize the 
diﬀerences. Another group of papers is concerned with systems based on Mereology. I 
will brieﬂy discuss the relevant papers in this order. 
Perhaps the most accessible introduction to Mereology is (Soboci´nski 1954a). Asenjo 
(1977) discusses the historical role that Le´sniewski’s Mereology played in the develop­
ment of non–classical set theories. Lorenz (1977) elaborates on the interplay between 
the partition of a whole into parts and the attribution of properties to an object. Prob­
ably the most up–to–date comprehensive book (in German) discussing mereologies is 
(Ridder 2002). Another book that may serve as a textbook (in English) is (Simons 1987). 
Just like it was the case with Le´sniewski’s other systems, some researchers devoted 
their attention to obtaining simpler axiomatizations of Mereology. Various formulations 
were oﬀered by Lejewski (1954a, 1955, 1962). Clay (1961) is concerned with obtaining 
new theorems of Mereology and simplifying its axiomatic basis. In his (1970), he showed 
that one of those axiomatizations of Mereology given by Lejewski contains a redundant 
axiom. 
Clay (1973) discusses a deﬁnition of the Cl operator simpler than that given initially 

170 
by Le´sniewski. Le´sniewski himself gave a fairly decent simpliﬁcation: 
∀a,b[a ε Cl(b) ≡ a ε a ∧∀c(b ⊆ el(c) ≡ a ε el(c))] 
However, his proof of its equivalence to the original deﬁnition, as originally given (Le´sniewski 
1930a), depends on the deﬁnition of a set (recall that deﬁnitions in Le´sniewski’s systems 
are creative). Soboci´ski is reported to have asked the question: does the equivalence proof 
depend on the deﬁnition essentially? Or, in other words: is the use of this deﬁnition in 
the proof creative? Clay (1973) proves that the answer to this question is negative. 
The consistency of Mereology has been proven by Clay (1968). Clay constructs a 
model of Mereology in which the domain is taken to be the set of all real numbers whose 
decimal expansions contain only zeros and ones with the exception of the number 0. Name 
variables range over subsets of this set. The epsilon has the standard interpretation and 
prt(a) is non–empty only if a is assigned a singleton. In this case it denotes the set of all 
those numbers x in the domain which for every position where the object belonging to 
the singleton assigned to a has a 1 in its decimal expansion, x has 1 at the same position 
too. In a way, this is a proof that if Ontology enriched with the axioms for real numbers 
is consistent, so is Mereology. 
Lejewski (1969) noticed that this might be interpreted as proving consistency of a 
fairly simple theory which depends on the consistency of a less intuitively obvious the­
ory. Hence, he focuses on proving the consistency of Mereology relative to a weaker 
subsystem of Mereology itself. The consistency of Ontology has been proven by a mem­
ber of Le´sniewski’s seminar before the war.57 If we interpret ontological variables as 
protothetical variables,58 and we interpret ε as the functor of conjunction, the theory 
57It is not clear who gave the proof, though. 
σ
58That is, if we interpret name variables as propositional variables and variables of category σ1,...,σn as 
σ0
variables of category σ1
0 ,...,σ0 where σ0 and the categories σi
0 result from σ and categories σi by replacing 
n 
all n’s by s’s. 

171 
becomes a sub–theory of Protothetic.59 Lejewski proved that if we additionally interpret 
el (element of) as the protothetical assertion operator, Mereology becomes a sub–theory 
of Protothetic as well. 
Clay (1974b) provides (indirectly) another consistency proof. He shows how the stan­
dard Euclidean 3–dimensional topological spaces provide a model for atomless Mereology. 
Since the classical Mereology is a subsystem of it, this proves consistency of Mereology 
relative to topology. 
Grzegorczyk (1955) argued that the models of Mereology are just complete Boolean 
algebras with zeros deleted.60 In a similar manner, Kubi´nski in his remark published 
in 1968 points out that Kl(a) may be taken in the algebraic interpretation (i.e. when 
we take the language of Ontology, interpret it in Boolean algebras by assigning subsets 
of the algebra to name variables) to be the least upper bound of the a’s. These claims 
were criticized by Clay (1974a) on the point that what Grzegorczyk (or Kubi´nski, for 
that matter) reconstructed was not Le´sniewski’s Mereology. First of all, variables in 
the system discussed by Grzegorczyk were individual variables. Secondly, Grzegorczyk’s 
quantiﬁcation was ﬁrst–order only. Another diﬀerence is that mereological models can be 
59Directives of Ontology become directives of Protothetic under that interpretation as well. 
60A Boolean algebra is a set A with two binary operators ∧ (meet) and ∨ (join), a unary operation ¬ 
(complement) which contains two elements 0 and 1, such that for any x, y, z ∈ A the following hold: 
x ∨ (y ∨ z) = (x ∨ y) ∨ z
x ∧ (y ∧ z) = (x ∧ y) ∧ z 
x ∨ y = y ∨ x
x ∧ y = y ∧ x 
x ∨ (x ∧ y) = x
x ∧ (x ∨ y) = x 
x ∨ (y ∧ z) = (x ∨ y) ∧ (x ∨ z) 
x ∧ (y ∨ z) = (x ∧ y) ∨ (x ∧ z) 
x ∨¬x = 1 
x ∧¬x = 0 
The ordering relation is put on a Boolean algebra by taking: 
a ≤ b ⇔ a = a ∧ b 
Now, we say that a subset B of an Boolean algebra A has a supremum if and only if there is an x ∈ A 
such that for all y ∈ B y ≤ x, and that for any z ∈ B for which y ≤ z for any y ∈ B, it is the case that 
x ≤ z. We say that A is a complete Boolean algebra if and only if every subset of A has a supremum 
(in A). 

172 
empty, whereas a complete Boolean algebra has to contain non-zero elements.61 Asenjo 
(1977) remarks that Grzegorczyk’s analogy breaks down if one does not require that 
Mereology has to be atomistic (Le´sniewski’s Mereology did not require the existence of 
atoms). 
(S lupecki 1958) can be interpreted as a similar attack against the novelty of Mereology. 
S lupecki hints that Mereology does not diﬀer formally from a certain elementary theory 
of partial ordering. However, he formulates it with Chwistek’s simple type theory as 
underlying logic, which as Clay (1974a) points out, ‘fails to include Ontology or any 
other theory of the distributive class to use as counterpoint for the notion of collective 
class.’ 
At least two straightforward modiﬁcations of Mereology are available. First, it is 
possible to add an axiom stating that every object is either an atom or is constructed 
from those atoms which are its parts, or one can add an axiom stating that no atoms exist. 
The former extension of Mereology has been dubbed ‘Atomistic Mereology’ and studied 
by Soboci´nski (1971). Both atomistic and atomless Mereologies have been provided with 
fairly simple axiomatizations by Clay (1975). 
A system of mereology inspired by Le´sniewski’s Mereology has been constructed by 
Goodman and Leonard (1940). It is weaker than Mereology. Richard Milton Martin 
attempted to develop a systematic approach to linguistic and multiple reference in the 
framework of a system of mereology (Martin 1988, 1992). 
Some papers discuss the possible role that Mereology can play in foundations of 
61By a non–zero element I mean an element which is not only a zero in an algebra. According to 
this nomenclature, an object which is both 0 and 1 is a non-zero element. 

173 
mathematics. Clay (1965) introduces the notion of weak discreteness:62 
∀a[w-dscr(a) ⇔
∀b,c,d,e[(d ε Kl(b) ∧ e ε Kl(c) ∧ b ⊆ a ∧ c ⊆ a ∧ d = e) → 
→∀a(a ε b ≡ a ε c)]] 
The condition states that a possible name a is weakly discrete iﬀ for any two names that 
name some of the objects named by a, if they diﬀer on the objects that they name, their 
(mereological) classes are diﬀerent. He shows that if the condition of weak discreteness is 
satisﬁed, classes behave in certain aspects like distributive sets.63 Clay proves an analogue 
of (5.42) (see p. 166), but instead of using the strong discreteness in the antecedent, he 
requires only that a name be weakly discrete. He also proved that if two equinumerous 
names a and b are weakly discrete, there are as many sets of a’s as there are sets of b’s 
(see Deﬁnition II on p. 151 for details regarding Le´sniewski’s understanding of sets). The 
crucial result proven by Clay, however, is the meta–theorem saying that for any formula φ 
involving only a1, . . . , an as name variables, equinumerosity and ‘denoting fewer objects’ 
operator, and ﬁnally, the set operator, any conditional with σ as its consequent and a 
formula which states strong discreteness of a1, . . . , an: 
∀a1,...,an (dscr(a1) ∧· · · ∧ dscr(an) → φ) 
is equivalent to a conditional with the same consequent, but whose antecedent states the 
62It is contrasted with the strong notion of discreteness, given by: 
∀a[dscr(a) ⇔∀c,d(c ε a ∧ d ε a → c = d ∨ c ε ex(d))] 
where 
∀c,d(c ε ex(d) ⇔∀b(b ε el(c) →¬b ε el(d))) 
This condition says that a possible name a is discrete iﬀ for any two possible names that uniquely name 
individuals named by a, they either name the same individual, or they name objects which have no 
common part. 
63A problem with this approach is that if one thinks about classes mereologically, a fairly elaborate 
story is required to explain why exactly the condition should be accepted. Clay does not provide such 
an explanation. 

174 
weak discreteness of a1, . . . , an: 
∀a1,...,an (w-dscr(a1) ∧· · · ∧ w-dscr(an) → φ) 
Le´sniewskian scholars have been concerned with related issues for a while. Soboci´nski 
is reported (Clay 1972) to have proven that if a is discrete (in the strong sense), then if 
a names ﬁnitely many objects, there are ﬁnitely many sets of a’s. Clay himself (1972) 
proves that this condition holds even without the assumption of discreteness of a. 
S lupecki (1958) attempted to modify Mereology in order to obtain a theory that could 
play the role of standard set theory but which would not commit one to sets. As it turns 
out, this strategy is not devoid of diﬃculties. Section 6.7 contains a wider discussion of 
this subject. 

Part II. Re-evaluation 
Sets and Ontological Commitment 

Chapter 6 
Le´sniewski’s approach to Russell’s paradox and set theory 
Soboci´nski in his paper on Le´sniewski’s solution to Russell’s paradox (1949b) argued 
that Le´sniewski has succeeded in explaining it away. The general strategy of this alleged 
explanation is presented. The key element of this attempt is the distinction between 
the collective (mereological) and the distributive (set-theoretic) understanding of the set. 
The mereological part of the solution, although correct, is likely to fall short of providing a 
sensible replacement for set theory. I argue that the remaining part of the solution which 
suggests a speciﬁc reading of the distributive interpretation is unacceptable, because it 
follows from it that every individual is an element of every individual. 
6.1 The problem 
Intuitively, we have in English a name-forming functor of one name argument. This 
functor is supposed to construct with its argument a name of the class of all and only 
those objects that are named by its argument. It is ‘the class of ’. So, for instance, 
we speak of the class of integers, the class of bears, the class of contradictory objects 
(apparently, it is the empty class), and so on. 
The question is how to introduce this functor formally within the framework of On­
tology. On the face of it, there is something more to a class than we can express with 
logical terminology. Therefore, the idea of just deﬁning an operator Kl by something 
like: 
∀a,b[a ε Kl(b) ≡ a ε a ∧ β] 
(6.1) 
where β is a sentential expression of Ontology with two free variables (a and b), does not 
176 

177 
seem to work. 
Another approach that we may take, is to try to introduce the connective axiomati­
cally. Here, the questions changes: what axiom(s) should we use? 
Let us take for granted the following: 
∀a,b[b ε el(a) ≡∃c(a ε Kl(c) ∧ b ε c)] 
(6.2) 
where el(a) is read as an element of a. Indeed, there seems to be nothing wrong with 
(6.2). We can paraphrase it as stating that an object b is an element of the class a if and 
only if there is a possible name c such that the class a is the class of all and only those 
objects that are c and b is a c. Given this assumption, which will constitute the hard 
core of what follows, what other axioms can we use to obtain a sensible set theory? 
Well, the ﬁrst stab may be like this: 
∀a∃b(b ε Kl(a)) 
(6.3) 
∀a,b,c,d[a ε Kl(c) ∧ a ε Kl(d) ∧ b ε c → b ε d] 
(6.4) 
Unfortunately, this will not work. We can easily deﬁne the name ? by: 
∀a[a ε ? ≡ a ε a ∧∀b(a ε Kl(b) →¬a ε b)] 
(6.5) 
The Kl(?) the existence of which would be guaranteed by (6.3) is something similar to 
the Russell’s class.1 Clearly, (6.3), (6.4) with (6.5) imply contradiction.2 
Theorem 1 (Soboci´nski). (6.3) (6.4) (6.5)` ⊥ 
Maybe something is wrong with (6.3)? Let us try to weaken this assumption. Replace 
it with the following: 
∀a,b[b ε a →∃cc ε Kl(a)] 
(6.6) 
1Although note that actually it does not even require that a be a class in order to be ?. 
2For the sake of simplicity, for most of the theorems I give only proof sketches, placing them in section 
6.5 of this chapter. They are suﬃcient for reconstructing the full-blown proofs. The ﬁrst three theorems 
in this chapter have been proven by Soboci´nski. Nevertheless, the proofs are interesting enough to at 
least go over them brieﬂy. 

178 
This says that if a name a is non-empty, there is a class of a’s. 
This, on Le´sniewski’s view, seems a little bit more intuitive, because he did not believe 
that an empty class exists. However, it does not solve our problem. Indeed, assume (6.6) 
and (6.4). These assumptions together with (6.5) lead to the conclusion that there exists 
at most one object: 
∀a,b[a ε a ∧ b ε b 
a ε b] 
(6.7)
→ 
which seems to be equally problematic. 
Theorem 2 (Soboci´nski). (6.4), (6.5), (6.6) ` (6.7) 
Frege in 1903 suggested weakening something like (6.4) to an assumption that may 
be expressed in Le´sniewski’s system by: 
∀a,b,c,d[a ε Kl(c) ∧ a ε Kl(d) ∧ b ε d ∧¬b ε Kl(d) 
b ε c] 
(6.8)
→ 
Unfortunately, in 1938 Le´sniewski showed that (6.8) and (6.6) lead to contradiction 
if we take two additional assumptions: 
∀a,b,c[a ε Kl(c) ∧ b ε Kl(c) 
a = b] 
(6.9)
→ 
∃a,b,c[a ε a ∧ b ε b ∧ c ε c ∧ a 6= b ∧ a 6= c ∧ b 6= c] 
(6.10) 
The ﬁrst of them states the uniqueness of the class of objects a, the second states 
that there are at least three diﬀerent objects: 
Theorem 3 (Soboci´nski). (6.6), (6.8), (6.9), (6.10) ` ⊥ 
The problem, as it is usually is the case with paradoxes, is that all those assumptions 
have their initial plausibility and they seem really intuitive. This is the reason why 
Le´sniewski thought that the usual restrictions of set theory (like, say, limiting the axiom 

179 
of comprehension) do not solve the problem. According to his view, the reason that set 
theorists who suggest some limitations give is that without those limitations we will have 
a contradiction. However, this fact alone does not account for the initial plausibility of 
the assumptions, and moreover the move does not explain what actually was wrong with 
our intuitions. 
Soboci´nski comments on Le´sniewski’s approach to the paradox: 
The fact of the existence of the paradox . . . forced Le´sniewski to submit the 
terms which appear in the presuppositions to a fundamental analysis. Since he 
was sure of the laws of logic on which our reasoning rests as well as the manner 
of understanding the logical constants contained in these laws, he analyzed 
the terms ‘class’ and ‘element’ . . . The examination of this problem led him to 
the conclusion that a superﬁcial determination of these terms . . . is insuﬃcient 
and mistaken and, in fact, provokes the appearance of the contradiction. 
According to Le´sniewski, there are two diﬀerent concepts encompassed by the 
term ‘class’: (a) distributive class, (b) collective class. (Soboci´nski 1949b: 30) 
6.2 Mereological classes 
In the collective reading, the class of a’s, KlM (a), is just the mereological whole con­
stituted by all a’s – or in other words, the mereological fusion of all objects named by 
a. 
With respect to the informal formulation of Russell’s paradox, Le´sniewski’s line of 
reasoning in his (1927) is quite straightforward. The paradox assumes that one of the 
following sentences is true: 
(6.11) 
The class of classes not subordinated to themselves is subordinated 
to itself. 

180 
(6.12) 
The class of classes not subordinated to themselves is not subordi­
nated to itself. 
where by ‘subordinated to’ Le´sniewski means ‘being an element of’. Next, the para­
doxical reasoning says that each of the above sentences implies the other, thus yielding 
a contradiction. 
Le´sniewski, referring to his discussion of the principle of excluded middle (1913b), 
points out that if no object is the class of classes not subordinated to themselves, then 
both sentences are plainly false, without implying a contradiction.3 
Suppose one could show that every class is subordinated to itself. Then the class of 
classes not subordinated to itself is empty. On the assumption that there is no empty 
set, this would imply that the class of classes not subordinated to themselves does not 
exist. This is the strategy Le´sniewski followed, for on his understanding of class – the 
mereological notion of class – both the reﬂexivity of the membership relation, and the 
non-existence of the empty set are easily established. 
If by Kl one means the operation of mereological fusion, and one identiﬁes (as 
Le´sniewski did) being an element of a class with being its part (proper or not), one 
easily gets the reﬂexivity of the relation of being an element. Indeed, since every object 
is identical with itself and to be an element of itself it has to be either identical to itself or 
a proper part of itself, every object is its own element. In fact, in his view, every object 
is a mereological class. Every mereological class is its own element. Hence, there is no 
empty class. For suppose there is. By deﬁnition it cannot have elements. But there is at 
least one element – the empty class itself (due to the reﬂexivity). So, there is no empty 
mereological class. Moreover, there is no class which is not an element of itself – thus 
the class of all classes which are not elements of themselves would have to be empty. So, 
3Indeed, given that ‘is’ is read as ε , if a does not name anything, it is false for any b that a ε b. 
Moreover, if one uses name negation, it is also false that a ε not − b. 

181 
it does not exist. 
The reader should remember that technically speaking, Mereology, as a formal system, 
is built on Ontology. It is the result of extending Ontology with one name-formative 
functor of one name argument. In the formulation which will be used here, this additional 
primitive symbol is prt, ‘a part of’, which together with a singular name, say a, constructs 
a name prt(a) which is a name that names all proper parts of a. 
There are four additional axioms.4 Two of them are: 
∀a,b[a ε prt(b) → b ε non(prt(a))] 
(6.13) 
∀a,b,c[a ε prt(b) ∧ b ε prt(c) → a ε prt(c)] 
(6.14) 
where non is an ontological functor deﬁned by: 
∀a,b[a ε non(b) ≡ a ε a ∧¬a ε b] 
(6.15) 
Two other axioms will require two deﬁnitions. Here are the deﬁnitions: 
∀a,b[a ε ingr(b) ≡ a = b ∨ a ε prt(b)] 
(6.16) 
∀a,b[a ε KlM (b) ≡ a ε a ∧∀c(c ε b 
c ε ingr(a)) ∧ 
(6.17)
→ 
∀c(c ε ingr(a) →∃d(d ε ingr(c) ∧∃e(e ε b ∧ d ε ingr(e))))] 
Two remaining axioms are: 
∀a,b,c[a ε KlM (c) ∧ b ε KlM (c) 
a ε b] 
(6.18)
→ 
∀a[∃bb ε a →∃cc ε KlM (a)] 
(6.19) 
Now, some important of consequences. 
(6.16) implies: 
4For more comments on Mereology and an explanation of these axiom see chapter 5, especially section 
5.2.1. 

182 
∀a[a ε a → a ε ingr(a)] 
(6.20) 
Deﬁne:5 
∀a,b[a ε el(b) ≡∃c(b ε KlM (c) ∧ a ε c)] 
(6.21) 
And here is the theorem that identiﬁes being an element with being an ingredient: 
Theorem 4. ∀a,b[a ε el(b) ≡ a ε ingr(b)] 
Theorem 5. There is no empty (mereological) set. 
How does this apply to the previous formulations? Read Kl as KlM . What happens 
with the problematic axioms if we take this reading? Consider (6.3). It may be read as 
saying that for any possible name there is the mereological class constituted by objects 
named by this name. This claim is false. As we have seen, if you take any empty name, 
there is no mereological class that corresponds to it. 
Consider (6.4). It is provably false. Take two names: people (who are alive) and 
halves of people (who are alive). The mereological fusion of people is the same as the 
mereological fusion of halves of people, but it is false that whatever is a half of a man is 
a man, or that whatever is a man is a half of a man. Thus we have dealt with the ﬁrst 
two formulations. 
And how about (6.6), (6.8), (6.9), (6.10)? Actually, (6.6) seems true (at least if you 
believe in unrestricted fusions): for any name that names at least one object there is a 
corresponding mereological class. (6.8) also seems to be false, for almost the same reason 
for which we rejected (6.4). For indeed, take the class of people: it is false that whatever 
is a half of a man and is not the class of people itself is a man. On the other hand, (6.9) 
5Note that this deﬁnition is just (6.2). 

183 
seems quite plausible: it just states that the mereological fusion is unique.6 Mereology 
does not provide any basis for disproving (6.10) (nor does it prove it). Actually, the claim 
that there are at least three objects is quite compelling, although it is hard to provide 
any argument to convince someone who already does not believe that this is the case.7 
Thus, if the mereological interpretation of classes is accepted, some of the assumptions 
turn out to be false – actually, they turn out to be quite intuitively so, and the feeling of 
paradox disappears. 
Like practically every solution to a philosophical problem, however, this one generates 
further diﬃculties (as it is quite well known). Mereology was developed by Le´sniewski 
as a system of foundations of mathematics.8 Unfortunately, so far no proof that it can 
perform this task has been given. As Peter Simons points out: 
Le´sniewski’s alternative to set theory is based on the (justiﬁed) assumption: 
If you follow me in what you mean by ‘member’ and ‘set’ you will not get 
into logical trouble. That is true, but the proponents of inconsistent set 
theory were doing more than trying to stay out of trouble (which is why 
they got into it in the ﬁrst place): they were trying to provide a logical 
foundation for mathematics, some of them with a view to showing at least 
part of mathematics to be just logic. Le´sniewski’s weaker system may, or, 
more likely, may not be adequate to that purpose. (Simons 1993: 7) 
6Of course some people reject this view, claiming that diﬀerent mereological fusions are obtained 
from the same constituents depending on the structure of the whole. In response it can just be said that 
they do not have the Le´sniewskian notion of parthood in mind. 
7This does not constitute any practical problem, since a person who would believe that there are at 
most two diﬀerent objects would be quite a rare specimen. 
8In the introduction to his ﬁrst paper on Mereology (1916) he wrote: “ The present work is the ﬁrst 
link in an extended series of works, which I intend to publish in the near or distant future, desiring 
to contribute as much as possible to the justiﬁcation of modern mathematics . . . The arrangement of 
deﬁnitions and truths, which I established in the present work dedicated to the most general problems of 
the theory of sets, has for me, in comparison to other previously known arrangements of deﬁnitions and 
truths (Zermelo, Russell, etc.) this advantage that it eliminates the ‘antinomies’ of the general theory 
of sets without narrowing the original domain of Cantor’s term ‘set’ . . . and on the other hand, it does 
not lead to assertions which are in such startling conﬂict with intuitions of the ‘commonalty’. . . ” 

184 
Indeed, as it is well known, mereological classes in many respects behave diﬀerently 
than it is expected of classes in the classical set theory. For instance: 
• No existence claim of any mereological class is implied by the axioms of Mereology. 
• The empty set does not exist. 
• Since being an element is transitive, there is no obvious iterative hierarchy of sets. 
• If no additional atomistic axioms are introduced, the notion of equinumerosity does 
not seem to apply to mereological classes.9 
• Kuratowski’s deﬁnition of ordered tuples does not work. 
6.3 Distributive classes 
On the other hand, it seems that we have some other notion of class which is far from 
being mereological. There is something compelling about the following sentences: 
(6.22) 
My dog’s leg is not an element of the class of dogs. 
(6.23) 
The class of integers is not an element of the class of integers. 
(6.24) 
The class of the class of elephants is not the same as the class of 
elephants. 
(6.25) 
My dog is an element of the class of dogs. The class of dogs is an 
element of the class of classes of animals. But my dog is not an element of 
the class of classes of animals. 
9Of course, this notion is deﬁned in Ontology, as applying to name variables or constants – the 
question to what extent mathematics can be founded on Ontology lies beyond the scope of this paper. 
The point here is only that mereological sets are indeed much diﬀerent from the sets postulated in, say, 
ZF. 

185 
These are examples of sentences true in the distributive reading.10 But in the collective 
interpretation all above sentences are false. The ﬁrst sentence indicates that the notion 
of distributive element is diﬀerent from parthood: a part of an element of a class does 
not have to be an element of this class. Distributively speaking, the relation of being 
an element is not reﬂexive. It also is not insensitive to iterations. It is not transitive. 
Now, how would Le´sniewski or Soboci´nski account for this sort of intuition?11 Let’s take 
a look at what the latter has to say: 
The expression ‘class(a)’ in the distributive sense is nothing more than a 
ﬁctitious name which replaces the well-known term of classical logic, ‘the 
extension of the objects a’. If one takes the term in this sense, the formula 
‘A ε Kl(a)’ means the same thing as ‘A is an element of the extension of the 
objects a’ or, more brieﬂy, ‘A is a’. In which case, the formula ‘Socrates is 
Kl(white)’ means the same thing as ‘Socrates is an element of the extension of 
white objects’; in other words: ‘Socrates is white’. Thus, the understanding 
10It is important to emphasize that the question I am concerned with is not whether there is a way 
of introducing into the language of Ontology a formal counterpart of the expression ‘the class of’ which 
would mimic correctly Le´sniewski’s understanding of this term (which was quite unusual), but rather 
how the expression ‘the class of’ in the nowadays most common, set-theoretic use can be imitated in 
the language of Le´sniewski’s systems. Thus, even if Le´sniewski would not share the intuitions behind 
the examples above, it does not matter. The point is that the sense of ‘the class of’ in which the above 
examples come out true seems to be a legitimate and widespread understanding of the expression in 
question and Mereology falls short of accounting for this plausibility. 
11Le´sniewski would probably say that the only irreducible sense of the word ‘class’ is that formalized by 
Mereology. There is an intriguing comment on Le´sniewski’s philosophical method made by Twardowski: 
In general, those who follow Le´sniewski, very arbitrarily demand an analysis where they 
ﬁnd it convenient; however, whenever someone demand an analysis where it is inconvenient, 
they refer to intuition. And when the opponent in the discussion tries at some point to 
refer to intuition as well, they respond: “We cannot understand what you claim to be 
intuitively given”. (K. Twardowski’s Diary, ms. 2407/3) 
[“W og´ole Ci, co post¸epuj¸a wed lug wzoru Le´sniewskiego, bardzo arbitralnie domagaj¸a si¸e analizy tam, 
gdzie im to dogodne; gdy si¸e jednak kto´s od nich domaga analizy tam, gdzie im to niedogodne, powo luj¸a

of ‘class’ in the distributive sense would reduce the formula ‘A ε Kl(a)’ to the 
purely logical formula ‘A ε a’, where ‘ ε ’ is understood as the connective of 
the individual proposition. (Soboci´nski 1949b: 31) 
The above account is objectionable for quite a few reasons. But, putting the objections 
aside for a while, let us see if this account helps to solve our problem. 
Indeed, replace α1 ε Kl(α2) by α1 ε α2 in the assumptions of the paradoxical argu­
ments. (6.3) becomes 
∀a∃bb ε a 
(6.26) 
which is disprovable in Ontology (basically because it says that every possible name is 
non–empty and in Ontology one can deﬁne the empty name and obtain the negation of 
(6.26) by existential quantiﬁer introduction). (6.4) is read as 
∀a,b,c,d[a ε c ∧ a ε d ∧ b ε d 
b ε c] 
(6.27)
→ 
which, again, is disprovable in Ontology. (6.6) turns out to be true: 
∀b,c[b ε c →∃aa ε c] 
(6.28) 
(6.8) becomes: 
∀a,b,c,d[a ε c ∧ a ε d ∧ b ε d ∧¬b ε d 
b ε a] 
(6.29)
→ 
which is tautologically true. (6.9) turns out to be a formula which is not provable and 
(almost) certainly false in the real world: 
∀a,b,c[a ε c ∧ b ε c 
a = b] 
(6.30)
→ 
6.4 Some more diﬃculties 
When expressions of the form α1 ε Kl(α2) are replaced by corresponding expressions 
of the form α1 ε α2 certainly some of the paradoxical assumptions are disproved. The 

187 
question is now: are we intuitively entitled to do so? Let us take a closer look at the 
justiﬁcation given by Soboci´nski. 
The expression ‘class(a)’ in the distributive sense is nothing more than a 
ﬁctitious name which replaces the well-known term of classical logic, ‘the 
extension of the objects a’. If one takes the term in this sense, the formula 
‘A ε Kl(a) ’ means the same thing as ‘A is an element of the extension of the 
objects a’ or, more brieﬂy, ‘A is a’. 
Soboci´nski does something quite unexpected here. For some reason he reads ‘ ε Kl(a)’ 
as ‘is an element of the extension of the objects a’. You certainly remember that Kl(a) 
is just the formal version of ‘ the extension of the name a ’. But if that is the case, ε 
is no longer being read by Soboci´nski as ‘is’, but rather as ‘is an element of’. However, 
this reading is plainly wrong given the interpretation given to ε by Le´sniewski. 
The above should suﬃce for rejecting the justiﬁcation that was given for the reduction. 
It does not constitute an argument against the reduction itself. So, here is an argument. 
Let us indeed concede that α ε Kl(β) is equivalent to α ε β. Then, (6.2) becomes: 
∀a,b[b ε el(a) ≡∃c(a ε c ∧ b ε c)] 
(6.31) 
which is certainly absurd. Take any two singular names, a, b. Clearly a ε a∪b∧b ε a∪b. 
Thus, ∃c(a ε c ∧ b ε c). But then, a ε el(b) and b ε el(a), that is, it turns out that any two 
individuals are elements of each other. This is a slightly inconvenient conclusion.12 
12Wait a second! Is not our eﬀort pointless? Is there really a need to introduce Kl? Is not Ontology a 
set theory already? Arguably, if one constructs a standard set-theoretic semantics for Ontology (name 
variables range over the power set of the domain of individuals etc.), something very much like the axiom 
of choice can be expressed in the language of Ontology by: 
∃f ∀a,b(a ε b → f(b) ε a) 
(6.32) 
which in the set-theoretic interpretation can be read as stating that there is an f such that for every 
non-empty set b, f(b) is an element of b (see (Davis 1975) for details). 
Davis himself uses set-theoretic paraphrases throughout his paper, commenting brieﬂy: 

188 
6.5 Proof sketches 
Proof of theorem 1. Indeed, (6.5) implies:13 
∀a[a ε ? → (aKl(?)

Set theoretic paraphrases will be used throughout this investigation since they are the most 
natural to use in discussions concerning the axiom of choice. (Davis 1975: 182) 
This line of reasoning is familiar. It resembles the standard argument to the eﬀect that the standard 
second-order logic is set theory (see section 7.3 for details). 
The fact that set-theoretic paraphrases are considered natural in a discussion does not imply that the 
paraphrased language indeed says something about sets. At most, one can be inclined to say that if it 
is assigned the standard set-theoretic semantics then it is possible to formulate in it formulas that are 
true in a model iﬀ a speciﬁc set-theoretic axiom (formulated in metalanguage) holds in the same model. 
This, in a sense, indicates that at least some facts usually stated in set theory may be taken to be 
expressible in the language of Ontology. The problem is that this does not answer the initial problem. 
Event hough formulas of Ontology may (in the standard set-theoretic semantics) have the same satis­
faction conditions as certain set-theoretic claims, the language of Ontology itself still does not contain a 
systematic device which would emulate the behavior of the usual set-theoretic jargon. I grant that there 
is a certain interesting translation along these lines: 
Class a is a subset of the class b 
∀c(c ε a → c ε b) 
Class a is empty 
¬∃bb ε a 
Classes a and b are disjoint 
¬∃c(c ε a ∧ c ε b) 
Still the language of Ontology is far from the generality enjoyed by the language of set theory. Let us 
take a closer look at (6.32). Take the common-sense set-theoretic semantics. We start with a possibly 
empty set of urelements, then construct the power set to obtain the range of name variables, and 
similarly for all other semantic categories. In this setting (6.32) says only that for any non-empty set 
of urelements there is a function that selects an element of that set. This is not the same as saying 
that for any nonempty family of pairwise disjoint nonempty sets there is a function which assigns to 
each element of that family a unique element of the input set. Of course, in Ontology we can emulate 
“nonempty family of pairwise disjoint nonempty sets of urelements” and similarly for any other “type” 
or “order” of the usual set-theoretic objects. But there is no single formula of Ontology which is true 
in a model if and only if the set-theoretic axiom of choice in its full generality is true in it. We have 
to introduce an axiom-of-choice-like formula for pretty much every semantic category separately. Now, 
since the language of Ontology has no upper limit on how complex semantic categories can get, this 
means that the best we could do is to suggest a choice schema under which all those particular choice 
axioms would fall. But this is quite diﬀerent from being able to express the axiom by means of a single 
formula of set theory. 
13In proofs occurring in this chapter all consequence-related expressions like ‘ implies’ , ‘ follows’ etc. 
are taken to refer only to provability in Ontology.

Thus: 
∀a[a ε Kl(?) →¬a ε ?] 
(6.35) 
From (6.4) and (6.35) we get: 
∀a,b[a ε Kl(?) ∧ a ε Kl(b)

Now suppose a ε Kl(?). Ontologically it implies a ε a. Also, together with (6.36) we 
obtain ∀b(a ε Kl(b) 
a ε b). These two constitute the deﬁniens in (6.5). Hence, a ε ?.

Thus: 
Now, (6.37) and (6.35) imply:

Suppose now a ε Kl(b). Then a ε a. From (6.5) and (6.40) it follows that for some c:

Deﬁne now: 

190 
∀a,b,c[a ε b ∪ c ≡ a ε b ∨ a ε c]

Suppose a ε a, c ε Kl(a ∪ v) and b ε c. Then: b ε b, a ε a ∪ b. By (6.6) we obtain the 
conclusion that for some d: d ε Kl(b). By (6.41): d ε b. Then also (since bec): d ε c, 
d ε Kl(a ∪ b). By (6.4) we get a ε b. With b ε b it follows that a = b. Thus: 
∀a,b,c[a ε a ∧ c ε Kl(a ∪ b) ∧ b ε c 
a = b] 
(6.43)
→ 
Now suppose a ε a, b ε b. Clearly, a ε a ∪ b. By (6.6), for some c: c ε Kl(a ∪ b). By 
(6.41) ca ∪ b. Thus c ε a ∨ c ε b. With a ε a, b ε b we get a ε c ∨ b ε c. Hence c ε Kl(a ∪ b). 
By (6.43), a = b, which proves (6.7). 
Proof of theorem 3. Suppose b ε c. By (6.6), for some a: a ε Kl(c). Applying the same 
move again we get: ∃aa ε Kl(Kl(c)). Thus: 
∀b,c[b ε c →∃aa ε Kl(Kl(c))] 
(6.44) 
Now suppose b ε d, a ε Kl(c), a ε Kl(d). By (6.8) you get b ε Kl(d) ∨ b ε c. By (6.9): 
a = b ∨ b ε c. Hence:

Assume b ε d, c ε Kl(Kl(d)), c ε Kl(Kl(e)). By (6.6) we know that for some a: a ε Kl(d). 
By (6.45), also: c = a ∨ a ε Kl(e). So: 
∀b,c,d,e[b ε d ∧ c ε Kl(Kl(d)) ∧ c ε Kl(Kl(e)) →∃a(a ε Kl(d) ∧ (c = a ∨ a ε Kl(e)))] (6.46) 
Suppose b ε d, a ε Kl(Kl(d)), c ε Kl(d), a = c. Hence a ε Kl(d). By (6.8): b ε Kl(d). 
By (6.9), a = b. Thus a ε d. So we have:

f ε Kl(b ∪ d) and c = f ∨ f ε Kl(d). Applying (6.9) we get a = f. Thus f ε Kl(d). By 
(6.45) f = b. It follows that b ε Kl(d). Hence:

e ε Kl(Kl(B ∪ D)) and e ε b ∪ d. This implies: e ε Kl(Kl(d ∪ b)), e ε b ∨ e ε d, b ε e ∨ d ε e. 
By (6.54) we get b ε Kl(d). Therefore: 
∀b,d[b ε b ∧ d ε d ∧ b =6
d → b ε Kl(d)] 
(6.55) 
Assume a ε a, b ε b, c ε c, a = b, b = c. By (6.55): a ε Kl(b), c ε Kl(b). By (6.9) a = c. 
Hence: 
∀a,b,c[a ε a ∧ b ε b ∧ c ε c ∧ a 6= b ∧ b 6= c → a = c] 
(6.56) 
Note that (6.56) is the negation of (6.10). This ends the proof. 
Proof of theorem 4. Suppose a ε el(b). By (6.21) for some c: b ε KlM (c), a ε c. By (6.17): 
a ε ingr(b). Hence: 
∀a,b[a ε el(b) 
a ε ingr(b)] 
(6.57) 
→ 
Now assume a ε a. By (6.20): ∃cc ε ingr(a). Again by (6.20): 
∀d[d ε ingr(a) 
d ε ingr(d) ∧ dingr(a)] 
(6.58)
→ 
Thus: 
∀d[d ε ingr(a) →∃e(e ε ingr(d) ∧∃f (f ε ingr(a) ∧ e ε ingr(f)))] 
(6.59) 
By (6.17) a ε KlM (ingr(a)). Hence: 
∀a(a ε a → a ε KlM (ingr(a))) 
(6.60) 
Suppose a ε ingr(b). By (6.16): a = b ∨ a ε prt(b). By (6.13) b ε b. By (6.60): 
b ε KlM (ingr(b)). Hence: 
∀a,b[a ε ingr(b) 
b ε KlM (ingr(b))] 
(6.61)
→ 

193 
Finally suppose a ε ingr(b). By (6.61): b ε KlM (ingr(b)). Using (6.21) we get: a ε el(b). 
Thus: 
∀a,b[a ε ingr(b) 
a ε el(b)] 
(6.62)
→ 
Proof of theorem 5. Deﬁne the empty set: 
∀a[a ε Φ ≡ a ε a ∧ ¬∃bb ε el(a)] 
(6.63) 
Now suppose for reductio that a ε Φ. By (6.63): a ε a and ¬∃bb ε el(a). By (6.20): 
a ε ingr(a). By theorem 4: a ε el(a). So ∃bb ε el(a) which is a contradiction. 
6.6 Higher-order epsilon 
6.6.1 What is higher-order epsilon? 
Recall now that the question that launched the discussion in chapter 6 about distributive 
classes was: how to imitate the usual talk about distributive classes within Ontology? As 
we have already seen, Lesniewski–Soboci´nski’s solution to the Russell’s paradox did not 
work very well. An alternative approach has been suggested (Lejewski 1985). I introduce 
deﬁnitions of class-like operators and the predication between sets so that one can ﬁnd 
a sensible translation from the language of Set Theory to the language of Ontology that 
preserves provability. To mimic predication between sets a diﬀerent sort of functors is 
needed. A predication operators of this sort are called higher-order epsilon operators 
(HO ε ). I will start with explaining brieﬂy what these are. Then I will consider a few 
ways they can be introduced. Next, I will try to see what happens if one actually applies 
this strategy to Russell’s paradox. 

194 
Formulae (6.65)-(6.69) were given and the whole approach was suggested by Lejewski 
(1985) and advertised in a diﬀerent context by Henry. (Henry 1972: 42-44) Henry, after 
introducing the above formulae has argued that 
∃b(b ε b ≡¬b ε b) 
(6.64) 
is not a theorem. He was also quite optimistic about his conclusions: “This gives one 
acceptable sense to the principle that there are classes of whatever sorts of objects one 
may specify. (Here ‘are’ has its higher-order sense.)” (1972: 44) After giving (6.64) and 
denying it, he comments: “This is a contradiction which mays be viewed as a version of 
Russell’s paradox. It is of course avoided. . . In other words, intuitive clarity can be main­
tained throughout, this version of the paradox is avoided, and ad hoc evasive strategems 
of a formalist nature shown to be needless.” (1972: 46) The rest of this section pur­
sues some consequences and issues that (I think) arise from the consideration of these 
deﬁnitions, purporting to show that the issue is not as simple as Henry suggested. 
The basic idea is that instead of treating Kl(a) as a name of a class, we put it in a 
semantic category diﬀerent from the category of names and treat ‘is’ as ambiguous. 
For example, ‘Socrates is a philosopher’ is parsed as s ε P , but a sentence of a similar 
form, ‘Reading is learning’ is, if we follow Le´sniewskian intuitions, not a sentence directly 
about objects. Indeed, it is rather as if we said that anything of which the verb ‘read(s)’ 
may be truly predicated would be a subject of a true predication of the verb ‘learn(s)’. 
This sort of ambiguity can be systematized in Le´sniewski’s Ontology. Deﬁne the weak 
identity ﬁrst: 
∀a,b[ (a, b) ≡∀c(c ε a ≡ c ε b)] 
(6.65)
◦

195 
Now, every one-place sentential functor of a name argument can be nominalized:14 
∀a,φ[a ε trmhφi ≡ a ε a ∧ φ(a)] 
(6.66) 
There are at least two interesting deﬁnition of class. The ﬁrst introduces the class 
generated by a name: 
∀a,b[Cl[[a]](b) ≡◦(b, a)] 
(6.67) 
where ‘Cl[[A]](b)’ may be read as ‘b is the class of a’s’, and the other introduced the class 
generated by a condition: 
∀a,φ[Cl[[φ]](a) ≡ Cl[[trmhφi]](a)] 
(6.68) 
where ‘Cl[[φ]](a)’ may be read as ‘a is the class of those objects that φ-ize’. 
The corresponding higher-order epsilon ε1 that may allow us to talk about classes is 
deﬁned: 
∀φ,ψ[φ ε1 ψ ≡∃a(φ(a) ∧ ψ(a)) ∧∀b,c(φ(b) ∧ φ(c) →◦(b, c))] 
(6.69) 
which, if you deﬁne: 
∀φ[exthφi ≡∀b,c(φ(b) ∧ φ(c) →◦(b, c))] 
(6.70) 
where exthφi may be read as ‘φ’ determines a unique possible name, up to coextensiveness 
(or, in other words, φ determines a class) may be expressed by: 
∀φ,ψ[φ ε1 ψ ≡∃a(φ(a) ∧ ψ(a)) ∧ exthφi)] 
(6.71) 
The basic idea is that φ ε1 ψ is true if there is only one (up to coextensiveness) name 
of which φ can be truly predicated and it is one of the names of which ψ can be truly 
predicated. 
14In the original notation o the papers at issue parentheses surrounding arguments of diﬀerent cate­
gories were of diﬀerent shapes. For the sake of convenience I follow this aspect of the original notation, 
as well as I keep using φ as a functor variable. There is no obvious assignment of shapes of brackets to 
semantic categories, I will just arbitrarily pick diﬀerent shapes for diﬀerent categories for the purposes 
of this chapter. 

196 
The following theorem indicates the contrast between the regular ε and the higher-
order ε1 : 
Theorem 6. The following are provable in Ontology: 
∀a[Cl[[a]] ε1 Cl[[a]]] 
(6.72) 
∀φ[Cl[[φ]] ε1 Cl[[φ]]] 
(6.73) 
¬∀aa ε a 
(6.74) 
Proof. From (6.65) we get 
∀a[ (a, a) ≡∀c[c ε a ≡ c ε a]] 
(6.75)
◦
the right side of the equivalence follows from ∀p(p ≡ p) (a trivial theorem of Protothetic). 
Thus ∀a ◦ (a, a). From (6.67) we get: 
∀a,b[Cl[[a]](a)] 
(6.76) 
From (6.69): 
∀a[Cl[[a]] ε1 Cl[[a]] ≡∃b(Cl[[a]](b) ∧ Cl[[a]](b)) ∧ exthCl[[a]]i] 
(6.77) 
Clearly ∃b(Cl[[a]](b)∧Cl[[a]](b)) follows from (6.76). To show that ∀a(exthCl[[a]]i), suppose 
that Cl[[a]](b) and Cl[[a]](c). By (6.67), (a, b), (a, c), and it is trivial that is symmetric
◦
◦
◦ 
and transitive (that results from the symmetry and transitivity of equivalence). Thus we 
get (6.72). To show (6.73) just note that (6.72) implies 
∀φ,a[Cl[[trmhφi]](a) ε1 Cl[[trmhφi]](a)] 
(6.78) 
and use (6.68). On the other hand to obtain (6.74), deﬁne: 
∀a[a ε Λ ≡ a ε a ∧¬a ε a] 
(6.79) 
Clearly, Λ ε Λ.

6.6.2 HO ε and Russell’s paradox (outlined) 
Let us temporarily assume that we can mimic the talk about distributive classes using the 
above strategy. What happens if we employ it to discuss Russell’s paradox as formulated 
by Le´sniewski and Soboci´nski? Here is a sketch of the discussion which will follow. 
Take the paradoxical axioms from section 6.1. Can they be interpreted using the 
above strategy? It turns out that we have to play around with the language in order to 
be able to translate them into the language of Ontology. Also, there is no unique possible 
way of massaging the axioms into the language of Ontology. (i) One of the options entails 
that only if a is a singular term there exists the class of a’s, which means that this read­
ing falls short of imitating the usual set-theoretic talk. (ii) Another way of translating 
the axioms turns (6.4) into a formula which entails that a ε Cl[[b]] is equivalent to a ε b, 
which is not a plausible identiﬁcation if we want to stick with the distributive reading 
(without running into the already discussed conclusion that for any two individuals one 
is an element of another). Thus, it seems, in this reading we lose the extensionality of 
distributive sets (which generally is not a good news if we want to imitate the usual 
language of set theory). (iii) Finally, I discuss yet another quite natural reading. Inter­
estingly, translating formulas that were contradictory on the previous reading using this 
strategy yields a set of theorems of Ontology (which we have good reasons to believe to 
be consistent). 
Here, I end the inquiry, and the moral from the story has a few components. First, 
some strategies of using higher-order epsilon to imitate the usual talk of set theory have 
to be rejected. Second, there is a quite natural higher-epsilon rendering of initially 
contradictory axioms where we obtain a consistent set of theorems of Ontology. The 
latter fact can be interpreted in at least two distinct ways: we can either say that this 
shows that the translation is inadequate because it does not preserve the provability 
operation (in which case we are left with nothing besides a criticism of higher-epsilon 

198 
strategies), or we can say that there is something intuitive about this translation and treat 
the question how the provability relation changes with the translation as interesting in 
itself. Now that a philosophical guide has been sketched, let us get back to the trenches. 
6.6.3 HO ε and Russell’s paradox (technically speaking) 
Consider (6.3): 
∀a∃bb ε Kl(a) 
(6.80) 
When we try to parse it using a higher-order epsilon, we see that neither b ε1 Cl[[a]]
nor b ε Cl[[a]] are well-formed. The standard ε takes two expressions of category n as ar­
s 
guments and is of category n,n . The ε1 operator, on the other hand takes two expressions 
of category n
s as its arguments and is of category 
s
, . There are two basic options: we
s
s 
n n 
can deﬁne a new higher-order epsilon of category n,
s that mixes these two and use it
s 
n 
in parsing the formulae, or we can somehow modify the semantic category of one of the 
arguments of an epsilon in the original formula. Let us start with the ﬁrst option. 
(i) Take another epsilon: 
∀a,φ[a ε2 φ ≡ a ε a ∧ φ(a)] 
(6.81) 
(6.3) in this reading renders: 
∀a∃b[b ε b ∧ Cl[[a]](b)] 
(6.82) 
but this implies ∃bb ε b which is not a theorem of Ontology. Another consequence is 
∀a∃b[b ε b ∧◦(a, b)], and thus ∀a[a ε a] (which contradicts (6.74) and is inconsistent with 
the axioms of Ontology). 
(6.4), another axiom, after translation yields: 
∀a,b,c,d[a ε2 Cl[[c]] ∧ a ε2 Cl[[d]] ∧ b ε d 
b ε c] 
(6.83)
→ 

199 
which is equivalent to: 
∀a,b,c,d[a ε a ∧ Cl[[c]](a) ∧ Cl[[d]](a) ∧ b ε d 
b ε c] 
(6.84)
→ 
and 
∀a,b,c,d[a ε a ∧◦(c, a) ∧◦(d, a) ∧ b ε d 
b ε c] 
(6.85)
→ 
which is a theorem of Ontology. 
When we translate another axiom, (6.6), the translation is: 
∀a,b[a ε b →∃cc ε2 Cl[[b]]] 
(6.86) 
which is equivalent to the disprovable formula: 
∀a,b[a ε b →∃c(c ε c ∧ Cl[[b]](c))] 
(6.87) 
The problem is that (6.81), seemingly innocent, results in 
∀a,b[a ε2 Cl[[b]] ≡ a ε a ∧◦(a, b)] 
(6.88) 
which implies that only if b is a singular term, there is an a such that a ε2 Cl[[b]]. 
(ii) Let us try a more subtle deﬁnition of a higher-order epsilon.15 
∀a,φ[a ε3 φ ≡ a ε a ∧∃b(a ε b ∧ φ(b))] 
(6.89) 
(6.6) yields: 
∀a,b[a ε b →∃c,d(c ε d ∧ Cl[[b]](d))] 
(6.90) 
which is equivalent to: 
∀a,b[a ε b →∃c,d(c ε d ∧◦(d, b))] 
(6.91) 
15What makes a connective a higher-order epsilon is an interesting question. The intuition is that f 
is an epsilon if the truth of f(δ, γ) requires some sort of uniqueness of the referent(s) of δ (presumably, 
up to coextensiveness), and some sort of inclusion between the referent(s) of δ and the referent(s) of γ. 
This however is far from providing a formally correct and precise deﬁnition. 

200 
which is valid. But let us return to (6.3) and (6.4). 
When we translate (6.3) using ε3 , we get: 
∀a∃bb ε3 Cl[[a]]
(6.92) 
This is equivalent to 
∀a∃b[b ε b ∧∃c(b ε c ∧ Cl[[a]](c))] 
(6.93) 
i.e. 
∀a∃b[b ε b ∧∃c(b ε c ∧◦(c, a))] 
(6.94) 
which is still not a theorem, because it implies ∃bb ε b. 
(6.4) renders: 
∀a,b,c,d[a ε a ∧∃e(a ε e ∧◦(e, c)) ∧∃e(a ε e ∧◦(e, d)) ∧ b ε d → b ε c] 
(6.95) 
which is disprovable in Ontology. 
Now, (6.4) in its initial form sounds like a pretty obvious claim about distributive 
sets. Why does it fail in the new reading? Consider what a ε3 Cl[[b]] boils down to: 
a ε a ∧∃c(a ε c ∧◦(c, b)) 
(6.96) 
that is, 
∃c(a ε c ∧◦(c, b)) 
(6.97) 
and thus it is equivalent to a ε b. But this identiﬁcation, as we already noticed (in section 
6.4), leads to other troubles, insofar as we accept the corresponding translation of (6.2). 
(iii) Well, maybe we indeed should have chosen another option and used ε1 in our 
translations, but instead of name variables we should have used n
s -operator variables? 
Let us try. In this reading (6.3) yields: 
∀a∃φφ ε1 Cl[[a]]
(6.98) 

201 
that is: 
∀a∃φ[∃b(φ(b) ∧ Cl[[a]](b)) ∧ exthφi] 
(6.99) 
which is equivalent to: 
∀a∃φ[∃b(φ(b) ∧◦(a, b)) ∧ exthφi] 
(6.100) 
(6.100) follows from (6.72), which makes it a theorem. 
Now, (6.4) becomes: 
∀φ,a,b,c[φ ε1 Cl[[a]] ∧ φ ε1 Cl[[b]] ∧ c ε b 
c ε a] 
(6.101)
→ 
that is: 
∀φ,a,b,c[∃d(φ(d) ∧ Cl[[a]](d)) ∧ exthφi ∧∃e(φ(e) ∧ Cl[[b]](e)) ∧ c ε b 
c ε a] 
(6.102)
→ 
which is equivalent to: 
∀φ,a,b,c[∃d(φ(d) ∧◦(a, d)) ∧ exthφi ∧∃e(φ(e) ∧◦(b, e)) ∧ c ε b 
c ε a] 
(6.103)
→ 
which is a theorem. 
Theorem 7. (6.103) is a theorem of Ontology. 
Proof. Suppose: ∃d(φ(d)∧◦(a, d)), ∀d,e(φ(d)∧φ(e)
(d, e)), ∃e(φ(e)∧◦(b, e)), c ε b Thus
→◦
there are some δ and γ s.t. 
φ(δ)
(a, δ) and φ(γ)
(b, γ) Also,
∧◦
∧◦
φ(δ) ∧ φ(γ)
(δ, γ). Hence: (δ, γ). By the transitivity of ◦,
(a, b) and thus c ε a.
→◦
◦
◦
The problem is that (6.3) and (6.4) originally led to contradiction. If (6.98) and 
(6.101) led to contradiction as well, it would have shown that Ontology is inconsistent. 
Fortunately an adaptation of the original proof of theorem (1) does not work. Let us try 
to employ our intuitive translation to (6.5), i.e. whenever we speak of classes rather than 
objects, we use ε1 instead of ε. Strictly speaking, that cannot be the only modiﬁcation, 
because we would get one of those two formulae: 
∀φ[φ ε1 ? ≡ φ ε1 φ ∧∀a(φ ε1 Cl[[a]]) 
φ ε1 a] 
(6.104)
→¬

202 
∀a[a ε ? ≡ a ε a ∧∀bb ε Cl[[a]]) →¬(b ε a)] 
(6.105) 
Neither of them would be well-formed. The latter version tries to introduce ? as a name. 
Since the general strategy that we (temporarily) accepted was rather to treat apparent 
names of classes as n
s expressions, let us try to ﬁx the former version. 
Deﬁne 
∀a,b[vrbmhai(b) ≡ b ε a] 
(6.106) 
This is only a simple trick that allows us to express predication using an expression of 
s 
category n
s formed from and expression of category n 
n . 
∀a[?(a) ≡ a ε a ∧∀φ(∃b(φ(b) ∧ Cl[[a]](b)) ∧ exthφi →¬(∃b(φ(b) ∧ vrbmhai(b)) ∧ exthφi))] 
(6.107) 
This deﬁnition is equivalent to: 
∀a[?(a) ≡ a ε a ∧∀φ(exthφi ∧ φ(a) → ¬∃b[φ(b) ∧ a ε b])] 
(6.108) 
which implies: 
∀a[?(a) ∧ a ε a 
((exth?i ∧ ?(a)) → ¬∃b[?(b) ∧ a ε b])] 
(6.109)
→ 
Also, ?(a) ∧ a ε a implies ∃b[?(b) ∧ a ε b]. So: 
∀a[?(a) ∧ a ε a 
((exth?i ∧ ?(a)) 
(?(a) ∧ a ε a))] 
(6.110)
→ 
→¬
By a theorem of Protothetic we also know that: 
∀a[ (?(a) ∧ a ε a) 
((exth?i ∧ ?(a)
(?(a) ∧ a ε a))] 
(6.111)
¬
→ 
→¬
From (6.110), (6.111) it follows: 
∀a[exth?i ∧ ?(a) →¬(?(a) ∧ a ε a)] 
(6.112) 

203 
From the deﬁnition of ? we know that ∀a[?(a) 
a ε a], so we have: 
→ 
∀a[exth?i ∧ ?(a) 
?(a) ∧ a ε a] 
(6.113)
→ 
(6.112) and (6.113) imply 
∀a¬(exth?i ∧ ?(a)) 
(6.114) 
Also: 
Theorem 8. It is a theorem of Ontology that: 
∀b,c(?(b) ∧ ?(c) →◦(b, c)) 
(6.115) 
i.e. that exth?i. 
Proof. Suppose ?(b). So by (6.108): 
b ε b ∧∀φ(exthφi ∧ φ(b) → ¬∃c[φ(c) ∧ b ε c]) 
(6.116) 
Also, the following is obviously a theorem: 
∀b,φ[b ε b ∧ φ(b) →∃c[φ(c) ∧ b ε c]] 
(6.117) 
Therefore 
b ε b ∧∀φ(exthφi ∧ φ(b) →∃c[φ(c) ∧ b ε c]) 
(6.118) 
So: 
b ε b ∧ ¬∃φ[exthφi ∧ φ(b)] 
(6.119) 
It is also a theorem that: 
∀b(b ε b →∃φ(exthφi ∧ φ(b))) 
(6.120) 
For indeed, suppose a ε a and deﬁne: 
∀a,b,c(µhaib ≡ b ε a) 
(6.121) 

204 
Clearly µhai(a). Suppose µhai(b) and µhai(c). Thus b ε a, c ε a, and (because a ε a) (b, c)
◦
and thus exthµhaii. 
So we have: 
b ε b ∧ ¬∃φ[exthφi ∧ φ(b)] ∧∃φ[exthφi ∧ φ(b)] 
(6.122) 
which clearly implies (b, c). Thus we get exth?i.
◦
Theorem 8 together with (6.114) implies: 
∀a¬ ? (a) 
(6.123) 
which is not such a bad conclusion. On the other hand, we cannot prove the negation of 
(6.123) in the way in which the inference went in the original antinomy. Indeed, originally 
(6.3) allowed to deduce the required formula (6.39). In the present case ∀φ∃aφ(a) is not 
a theorem (and a fortiori (6.98) does not imply it). For we can easily deﬁne a φ such 
that ¬∃aφ(a), using a much simpler deﬁnition than that of ?. 16 
On one hand, this is good news, for we do not get the straightforward contradiction 
as in the original case. On second thought, this result is also somewhat annoying if one 
wants to suggest that an appropriate part of Ontology with the higher-order epsilon may 
perform the task of set theory. Let φ temporarily represent formulas of the classical set 
theory (ST). Let us denote the set of formulas of Le´sniewski’s Ontology by LO. Suppose 
we have a translation t : ST 
LO which corresponds to the intuitive translation
7→ 
employing ε1 discussed above. Let `ST , `LO stand for the consequence operation in the 
classical set theory and in Le´sniewski’s Ontology respectively. It is not in generally 
true that whenever Σ `ST φ then t(Σ) `LO t(φ). Thus, even when we show that all 
translations of the axioms of set theory are theorems, we still do not know whether the 
theory itself is strong enough to provide us with all the theorems that we want to have. 
16Consider e.g. 
∀a[ν(a) ≡ a ε a ∧¬a ε a] 
(6.124) 

205 
On the other hand, if we can show that some translations of some important theorems 
of set theory are not LO-theorems, we have a good argument against Henry’s optimistic 
claim about the importance of the higher order epsilon.17 Investigations regarding this 
weaker consequence, however, quite interesting in their own right, lie beyond the scope of 
this chapter. Suﬃce it to say that the view that set theory can be fully imitated within 
the language of Ontology is still highly implausible.

6.7 S lupecki’s generalized mereology 
6.7.1 System M 
S lupecki (1958)18 attempted to extend Le´sniewski’s mereology in order to obtain a mere­
ological equivalent of set theory. As he put it: 
Generalizing mereology, I keep in mind the following two aims: 
(a) in the generalized system the notion of a set should preserve its intuitive 
sense; speciﬁcally sets should be deﬁned in a way that treats them as concrete 
objects. 
(b) the generalized system of mereology should be able to underlie mathemat­
ics to the same extent to which simple type theory or axiomatic set theory 
does. This purpose has not been attained by Le´sniewski’s own system, in 
which, for instance, natural numbers arithmetic cannot be built. (S lupecki 
1958: 156)19 
S lupecki, instead of Ontology (with name variables a, b, c, . . . uses a language with 
individual variables x, y, z, . . . predicate variables f, g, f1, g1, . . . and general functor vari­
ables φ, φ1, . . . (whose category is to be contextually salient), and he often uses formulas 
with free variables as if the free variables occurring in them were bound by a universal 
quantiﬁer standing in the front of the formula. All his axioms mimic Le´sniewski’s axioms 
for Mereology. He assumes the reﬂexivity and transitivity of (improper) parthood rela­
18The problem with reconstructing S lupecki’s generalized mereology is that the only paper that he 
published which pertained to it is a four-page abstract, so quite a few details have to be ﬁlled out by 
the reader. What follows is my best shot and understanding what the system looks like.

tion and assumes extensionality, pretty much as Le´sniewski’s axioms (a-c) of the 1920 
axiomatization of Mereology.20 S lupecki’s axiom 4 states the existence and uniqueness 
of a fusion of objects satisfying a predicate, and it follows from axiom (d) (which states 
the existence of the fusion) and other axioms of the 1920 formulation of Mereology.21 
S lupecki also provides certain assumption that go beyond what Le´sniewski has done. His 
axiom 5 postulates that there be a certain ﬁxed object which will be used as a proxy for 
the empty set,22 and he deﬁnes a few interesting notions that are supposed to allow us 
to mimic the language of set theory. 
S lupecki starts with formalizing his version of Mereology in a fairly standard higher-
order language. He introduces an additional constant ≤ which stands for parthood 
relation. Axioms that he introduced more or less mirror Le´sniewski’s axioms: 
A.1.
x ≤ x 
A.2. x ≤ y ∧ y ≤ z → x ≤ z 
A.3.
x ≤ y ∧ y ≤ x
x = y
→ 
Deﬁnitions of overlapping and fusion are fairly standard: 
D.1.
x † y ≡∃z(z ≤ x ∧ z ≤ y) 
D.2. xδf ≡∀z[f(z) → z ≤ x] ∧∀y{y ≤ x →∃z[f(z) ∧ z † y]} 
The category of f is n
s , it is just a predicate of a ﬁrst order language and we read ‘xδf’ 
as ‘x fuses f’. The last axiom states the uniqueness of fusions of nonempty predicates: 
A.4. 
xδf 
∃yf(y) →∃!x
20The background logic is diﬀerent but the properties of the parthood relation are in a strong sense 
the same. 
21Basically, the uniqueness follows from extensionality. 
22So S lupecki’s system, unlike Le´sniewski’s is not free of existential assumptions. 

208 
In the language of Le´sniewski’s Mereology the above formulas would probably have 
the following form: 
∀a(a ε a → a ε ingr(a)) 
(6.125) 
∀a,b,c(a ε ingr(b) ∧ b ε ingr(c) → a ε ingr(c)) 
(6.126) 
∀a,b(a ε ingr(b) ∧ b ε ingr(a) → (a ε b ∧ b ε a)) 
(6.127) 
∀a,b(a ε orl(b) ≡ ∃c(c ε ingr(a) ∧ c ε ingr(b))) 
(6.128) 
∀a,b(a ε fus(b) ≡ a ε a ∧ ∀c(c ε b → c ≤ a) ∧ ∀c(c ≤ a → ∃d(d ε b ∧ d ε orl(c)))) 
(6.129) 
∀b(∃aa ε b → ∃c(c ε fus(b) ∧ ∀d(d ε fus(b) → d ε c))) 
(6.130) 
From now on I will translate S lupecki’s formulas into the language of Le´sniewski’s 
mereology without giving their original form ﬁrst. 
The ﬁrst thing that S lupecki wants to account for is the fact that when we speak of 
classes in natural language we do seem to refer to the empty set. He introduces a name 
constant 0, which he also axiomatically assumes to refer to an object. Thus, he accepts 
as an axiom: 
∃a0 ε a 
(6.131) 
where ‘0’ is supposed to be “a name of an arbitrary but ﬁxed object” (p. 156) Then, in 
his generalized mereology the deﬁnition of a set has the following form (for the “S lupecki 
class” I use the symbol CLS , to diﬀerentiate it from the Le´sniewski’s notion of class): 
∀a,b(a ε CLS (b) ≡ (a ε fus(b) ∧∃cc ε b) ∨ (¬∃cc ε b ∧ a ε 0)) 
(6.132) 
The basic idea here is that the class of b’s is the fusion of b’s if the name is non–empty 
and it is identiﬁed with the selected object 0 otherwise. He also indicates how classes 
generated by expressions of categories 
s
s 
s
s 
, 
, . . . , σk, 
, 
. . . 
s

209 
can be deﬁned. The class of objects that correspond to an expression b of category n is 
just CLS (b). The class generated by an expression φ of category n
s is deﬁned by: 
∀a,φ(a ε Δφ ≡ a ε a ∧∃b(φ(b) ∧ a ε ClS (b))) 
(6.133) 
Intuitively, φ determines a name which names all and only those fusions of b’s for which 
it is true that φ(b). For expressions of category s the deﬁnition is quite similar: 
s 
n 
∀a,Φ(a ε ΔΦ ≡ a ε a ∧∃φ(Φ(φ) ∧ a ε ClS (Δφ))) 
(6.134) 
That is, take the S lupecki class generated by Δφ. If it is true that Φ(φ), then ClS (Δφ) 
is one of the ΔΦ. ClS (Δφ) is the class corresponding to φ and ClS (ΔΦ) is the class cor­
responding to Φ. Deﬁnitions of classes corresponding to expressions of higher categories 
are analogous. 
Another notion that S lupecki thinks needs redeﬁning is the notion of being an element 
of a set. This is because Le´sniewski’s deﬁnition of el eventually identiﬁes being an element 
of a set with being its ingredient. In order to introduce a more ﬁne-grained notion, 
S lupecki deﬁnes three auxiliary notions. 
∀a,b,c(δ1(a, b, c) ≡ a ε c ∧ a ε ingr(b)) 
(6.135) 
∀a,b,c,φ(δ2(a, b, c, φ) ≡ φ(c) ∧ a ε ingr(b)) 
(6.136) 
∀a,b,φ,Φ(δ3(a, b, φ, Φ) ≡ Φ(φ) ∧ a ε ingr(b)) 
(6.137) 
To explain the notion of being an element S lupecki introduces the following abbreviations 
(mind that they are not deﬁnitions because they explain the meaning of ∈1, ∈2, ∈3, . . . 
only in certain contexts). 
∀a,b(a ∈1 ClS(b) ≡ δ1(x, ClS (b), b)) 
(6.138) 
∀a,φ(ClS (a) ∈2 ClS (Δφ) ≡ δ2(ClS (a), ClS (Δφ), a, φ)) 
(6.139) 

210 
∀φ,Φ(ClS (Δφ) ∈3 ClS (ΔΦ) ≡ δ3(ClS(Δφ), ClS (ΔΦ), φ, Φ)) 
(6.140) 
Now, S lupecki in order to obtain a “copy” of the language of set theory invites us to take 
all theorems of his mereology and throw out all the theorems which are not constructed 
from: 
a ∈1 ClS (b), ClS (a) ∈2 ClS (φ), ClS (Δφ) ∈ ClS (ΔΦ), . . . 
(6.141) 
together with propositional connectives and quantiﬁers. The intersection of the set of 
theorems of his mereology with this language is dubbed ‘system M of generalized mere­
ology’.23 
From among theorems of Ontology we distinguish theorems constructed from: 
a ε b, φ(a), Φ(φ), . . . 
(6.142) 
together with propositional connectives and quantiﬁers. The system thus distinguished 
is called S1. 
Now, deﬁne the following mapping from the language of S1 onto the language of M. 
To every n-th element of the sequence in (6.142) assign the n-th element of the sequence 
in (6.141). If α1 and β1 are assigned to α and β, f1 is a one-place sentential connective, 
f2 is a two-place sentential connective, then assign: f1α1 to f1α, α1f2β2 to αf2β, ∃τ α1 
to ∃τ α and ∀τ α1 to ∀τ α. 
Notice that the following are theorems of M: 
∀a,b(a ∈1 ClS (b) ≡ a ε b) 
(6.143) 
∀a,φ(ClS (a) ∈2 ClS (Δφ) ≡ φ(a)) 
(6.144) 
23It is a fairly awkward procedure, for the axioms of the theory no longer are theorems of system M, 
but the set of theorems of M is nevertheless well deﬁned. We just do not have a deductive system for it 
anymore. Of course, this does not mean that we cannot formulate an axiomatic system in the language 
of M that would generate all and only theorems of M. This, however, lies beyond the scope of present 
considerations (I was not interested in obtaining it because I think that as a replacement for set theory 
M is ﬂawed anyway). This does not mean that the system is not interesting in itself. 

211 
∀φ,Φ(ClS (Δφ) ∈3 ClS(ΔΦ) ≡ Φ(φ)) 
(6.145) 
and so on. Hence the mapping between S1 and M establishes an isomorphism between 
the theories. Since S1 in quite an obvious manner corresponds to the language of simple 
type theory, S lupecki’s comment is: 
It follows that system M, and even more the whole system of generalized 
mereology suﬃces as a system of foundations of mathematics, because – as 
it is well-known – S1 suﬃces for that purpose. This conclusion may seem 
trivial because the full system of simple type theory without any additions 
can constitute a foundation of mathematics. However, in my paper I give 
arguments (I realize that those arguments are not wholly convincing and for 
that reason I do not repeat them here) indicating that constants belonging 
to semantics categories to which variables f, φ, Φ, . . . belong are not names 
of sets or any other objects, but rather expressions devoid of independent 
reference. Those terms cannot denote concrete objects, so the full system 
of simple type theory does not fulﬁll aim (a), which was mentioned above. 
(p. 158)24 
6.7.2 Diﬃculties 
Notice ﬁrst that introducing (6.131) is a technical trick which is not intuitively justiﬁed. 
Not only does the theory cease to be, in a sense, ontologically neutral (that is, it did 
not require that there exist any object before), but also, philosophically speaking, there 
24“St¸ad te˙z wynika, ˙ze system M, a tym bardziej ca ly system uog´olnionej mereologii, wystarcza do

212 
seems to be no object which we could pick out and determine to do the job of the empty 
set. Clearly, on Le´sniewski’s view, technical niceties that this move provides do not 
constitute a reason for departing from our intuitions about empty set. And one of the 
main intuitions is that if we think of sets mereologically there is no reason to say that 
there is an empty set (and if we do not think of sets mereologically, it seems clear that 
the empty set is not just an arbitrarily picked and ﬁxed concrete object). 
Another counterintuitive fact is this. The S lupecki class determined by a “property” 
φ is just the fusion of all the objects that have it (if anything has that property at all). 
For instance, deﬁne a name constant U: 
∀a(a ε U ≡ a ε a ∧ (a ε a ∨¬a ε a)) 
(6.146) 
The object ClS (U), with respect to a ﬁxed domain of discourse is just the fusion of all 
objects existing within this domain. Analogously we can deﬁne: 
∀a(φ0(a) ≡ a ε a ∧ (a ε a ∨¬a ε a)) 
(6.147) 
∀a(φ00(a) ≡ (a ε a ∨¬a ε a)) 
(6.148) 
Then, ClS (Δ0
φ) is the same object as ClS (Δφ00 ). For indeed, 
∀a[a ε Δφ0 ≡ (a ε a ∧∃b(φ0(b) ∧ a ε ClS (b)))] 
That is, 
∀a[a ε Δφ0 ≡ (a ε a ∧∃b((b ε b ∧ (b ε b ∨¬b ε b) ∧ a ε ClS (b))))] 
∀a[a ε Δφ0 ≡ (a ε a ∧∃b(b ε b ∧ a ε ClS (b)))] 
But if a ε a then also a ε ClS (a). Hence: 
∀a[a ε Δφ0 ≡ a ε a] 
(6.149) 
Also, 
∀a[a ε Δφ00 ≡ (a ε a ∧∃b(φ00(b) ∧ a ε ClS (b)))]] 

213 
∀a[a ε Δφ00 ≡ (a ε a ∧∃b((b ε b ∨¬b ε b) ∧ a ε ClS (b)))]] 
∀a[a ε Δφ00 ≡ (a ε a ∧∃b(a ε ClS (b)))]] 
But since if a ε a then a ε ClS (a), it also follows that if a ε a then ∃b(a ε ClS (b)). Therefore: 
∀a[a ε Δφ00 ≡ a ε a] 
(6.150) 
(6.144) together with (6.147) imply that: 
∀a(ClS (a) ∈2 ClS (Δφ0 ) ≡ φ0(a) ≡ a ε a) 
and together with (6.148) implies that: 
∀a(Cls(a) ∈2 ClS (Δφ00 ≡ φ00(a) ≡ a ε a ∨¬a ε a) 
But this indicates that at least certain instances of the indiscernibility of identicals have 
to be rejected. In this case, we should reject: 
∀a,φ,ψ[ClS (Δφ) = ClS (Δψ)
(ClS (a) ∈2 ClS (Δφ) ≡ ClS (a) ∈2 ClS (Δψ))] 
(6.151)
→ 
Otherwise, the theory would imply that ∀aa ε a, which contradicts an already provable 
theorem of Ontology: ∃a¬a ε a. 
Therefore it seems S lupecki’s generalized mereology has certain ﬂaws that precludes 
it from being a good candidate for a nominalist replacement for the language of any 
mainstream set theory. Even if the theory was devoid of oddities of the kind mentioned 
above, it still would not be obvious that it follows the Le´sniewskian agenda and satisﬁes 
S lupecki’s requirements. For the worry brought up by S lupecki remains: simple type 
theory without mereological extensions can serve as foundation of mathematics (in a 
sense) and unless a nominalistically satisfying account of higher-order quantiﬁers and 
variables is given, the question whether the system works as advertised is open. 

Chapter 7 
Modal interpretation of plural quantiﬁers 
7.1 Introduction 
Le´sniewski was a nominalist and he constructed Protothetic, Ontology and Mereology in 
his endeavor to provide a nominalistically acceptable foundations of mathematics. Yet, 
a philosophical question arises, even simpler than the question whether the systems are 
suﬃciently rich to capture certain intuitions that we have about sethood, the question 
whether the logical part of the theory (Protothetic and Ontology) is ontologically innocent 
and does not commit one to the existence of abstract objects. 
The question is: can a nominalist use Le´sniewski’s quantiﬁcation, especially in Ontol­
ogy? What, for instance, do name variables in Ontology range over? Le´sniewski himself 
did not provide any intuitive explanation of his quantiﬁers and the ﬁrst stab might be 
that it is subsets of the domain of individuals that have to be values of bound variables 
of this sort. If this really is the case, anyone who uses the system will fail in providing a 
nominalistic reconstruction of mathematics. 
In this sense, the question of how Le´sniewski’s quantiﬁers can be interpreted without 
commitment to abstract objects is prior to the question whether (a decent part of) 
mathematics can be reconstructed within his systems. In this chapter I focus on the 
question of ontological commitment of Le´sniewski’s quantiﬁcation. First, I introduce the 
language of Quantiﬁed Name Logic (QNL) which, practically is just a very basic part 
of Le´sniewski’s Ontology1 (section 7.2.1) and provide it with a set–theoretic semantics 
(section 7.2.2). Next, I compare QNL with Boolos’s logic of plurals and prove that the 
1Basically, the one that we get when we admit name variables and quantiﬁers binding those variables 
only. 
214 

215 
expressive power of both languages (modulo set–theoretic semantics) is the same (section 
7.2.3). 
Having done that, I discuss the question whether plural quantiﬁcation commits its 
users to sets. I start with a “phony” argument to the eﬀect that it does (section 7.3). 
It ultimately rests on the assumption that the logic obtained with the substitutional se­
mantics is devoid of certain theoretically preferable features that QNL with set–theoretic 
semantics has. 
This is the assumption that I challenge in section 7.4. In order to do that I develop a 
substitutional semantics which avoids the objections raised in section 7.3. First, I discuss 
two earlier attempts of providing plural quantiﬁcation with ontologically innocent seman­
tics. In section 7.4.1 I present combinatorial semantics (introduced by Peter Simons) and 
indicate its weak points. In section 7.4.2 Rickey’s natural models are deﬁned. Unfortu­
nately it is quite probable that Rickey’s semantics does not avoid the objections against 
substitutional reading of quantiﬁers raised before. 
In section 7.4.3 I develop a Kripke semantics for the logic of plurals (some of basic 
ideas stem from the considerations of Simons and Rickey). It is a modal interpretation, 
where the plural quantiﬁer ‘∃aφ’ (suppose φ does not contain free variables other than 
a) is intuitively read as ‘it is possible to introduce a name a which would make φ substi­
tutionally true.’ There are good reasons to claim that QNL with Kripke semantics has 
the same expressive power as QNL with set–theoretic semantics (as it turns out, for any 
set–theoretic model there is a Kripke model which agrees with it on all QNL formulas 
and the other way round: for any Kripke model there is a set–theoretic model which 
agrees with it on all formulas). 
Next, in section 7.4.4 I explore the modal factor involved in this semantics by develop­
ing a two–sorted ﬁrst–order modal logic of naming (MLN). I show that QNL with Kripke 
semantics can be embedded in the language of MLN. Since this embedding preserves 

216 
models (i.e. models for QNL and MLN are the same, what changes is just the inter­
pretation of symbols), it seems that the ontological commitment of QNL with Kripke 
semantics does not go beyond the ontological commitment of ﬁrst–order (two–sorted) 
modal logic (with one relation constant). Since it is much less plausible that ﬁrst–order 
modal logic commits one to abstract objects than that plural quantiﬁcation does, this 
strengthen my case for the ontological innocence of QNL. 
The last section of this chapter (7.4.5) contains philosophical comments regarding 
the content of previous sections. I brieﬂy compare my approach to Chihara’s theory of 
constructibility quantiﬁers, discuss the issues pertaining to the ontological commitment, 
show how this approach avoids the usual objections against substitutional interpretation 
of plural quantiﬁers, and defend the view that there is nothing philosophically suspicious 
about restricting admissible models to complete naming structures (a notion to be deﬁned 
in section 7.4.3). 
7.2 Quantiﬁed name logic 
7.2.1 The language 
Variables ranging over tuples of symbols (or of tuples of tuples, etc.) from a contextually 
salient alphabet are σ’s with (or, in one case, without) numerical subscripts.2 
A formal language L can be thought of as a tuple hA, Σi, where A is a countable 
alphabet of L (containing brackets) and Σ is its basic signature. The elements of A 
which are not brackets will be called ‘letters’. 
The set of types T is deﬁned by the following conditions: (i) hsi, hni ∈ T , (ii) if 
σ, σ1, . . . , σn ∈ T , then hσ, σ1, . . . , σni ∈ T . Often instead of hsi, hti we will just write s, t. 
A basic signature Σ of a language L is a function from L’s alphabet without the 
2Basically: those tuples that can be “built” from elements of this alphabet given that tuples can 
occur in tuples. 

217 
brackets (i.e. the set of all non-bracket expressions of L which are not further meaning­
fully decomposable into simpler expressions of L) into T . A signature relative to a set of 
symbols A, ΣA is a function mapping L’s alphabet into a set of types that can be built 
from elements of A. 
The signature function assigns to every non-bracket symbol of L its syntactic type. 
Intuitively, s is the type of sentences and n is the type of names, which are the two basic 
types (for now). A tuple hσ, σ1, . . . , σni is the type of those expressions which applied to 
n arguments of types (respectively) σ1, . . . , σn yield a complex expression of type σ. 
We construct the set of well-formed expressions of L and extend the signature func­
tion. Letters of L are well-formed expressions of L. If τ, τ1, . . . , τn are well-formed 
expressions of L, Σ(τi) = σi (1 ≤ i ≤ n), and Σ(τ) = hσ, σ1, . . . , σni then τ(τ1, . . . , τn) is 
a well-formed expression of L of type σ. 3 If a well-formed expression of L is of type s, it 
is a well-formed formula of L. 
The language that we will be working with in this chapter is generated by the alphabet 
containing brackets, name variables a1, a2, a3, . . . (as an abbreviation, also a, b, c, d, 
possibly with numerical subscripts), all of type n, the constant ε of type hs, n, ni, the 
existential quantiﬁer ∃ of type hs, n, si (the universal quantiﬁer ∀ has its usual deﬁnition). 
The restriction on the use of quantiﬁers is quite obvious: the argument of type n cannot 
be a constant. Here this will not bother us unless we introduce constants into our 
language. Also, I will write bound variables in the subscript of the quantiﬁer and write 
multiple bound variables after a single quantiﬁer instead of writing multiple quantiﬁers. 
The negation symbol 
is of type hs, si and the conjunction symbol ∧ of type hs, s, si.
¬ 
Other propositional connectives are deﬁned as usual. 
If we denote the language under present discussion by ‘QNL ε ’, the above yields the 
usual inductive deﬁnition. The set of well-formed formulas of QNL ε is the least set 
3With a slight proviso for the quantiﬁer, read on for details. 

218 
satisfying the following conditions: 
1. If α1, α2 are name variables, ε (α1, α2) is a well-formed formula. 
2. If φ1, φ2 are well-formed formulas and α is a name variable, also 
(φ1), ∧(φ1, φ2)
¬
and ∀αφ1 are well-formed formulas. 
As variables standing for well-formed formulas (the context will determine what lan­
guage we are talking about) I will use φ, ψ, possibly with numerical subscripts. I will also 
use inﬁx notation for the epsilon and connectives and drop brackets according to usual 
conventions (in terms of the binding strength, 
is ﬁrst and ∧, ∨, →, ≡ follow). 
¬ 
7.2.2 Set-theoretic semantics 
Let us start with quite an imparsimonious but fairly standard semantics for QNL ε . Take 
the domain to be a set of objects and take the range of name variables to be the powerset 
of the domain. An S-model of QNL ε is a pair hD, Ii such that D is an arbitrary set 
and I is a total function which maps name variables into the powerset of D (i.e. to each 
name variable it assigns a subset of the domain). 
Neither D nor I(a) for any a has to be non-empty. Let α, β be meta-variables ranging 
over name variables and let φ, ψ be meta-variables ranging over wﬀs. 
We can deﬁne the truth in an S- model as follows: 
hD, Ii
|= ε (α, β) iﬀ |I(α)| = 1 and I(α) ⊆ I(β) 
(7.1) 
hD, Ii
|= ¬φ iﬀ hD, Ii 6|= φ 
(7.2) 
hD, Ii
|= φ ∧ ψ iﬀ both hD, Ii |= φ and hD, Ii |= ψ 
(7.3) 
hD, Ii
|= ∃αφ iﬀ hD, Iαi |= φ 
for some Iα which diﬀers from I at most at α. 
(7.4) 

219 
7.2.3 QNL ε and Boolos’ logic of plurals 
The logic of plurals has been ﬁrst developed by Boolos (1998a), but in presenting its 
syntax I will follow a slightly more regimented formulation given by Linnebo (2004).4 
The pure5 language of the logic of plurals (LP) has among its terms singular 
variables (x, x1, x2, . . .) and plural variables (xx, xx1, xx2, . . .). It contains two 2-place 
logical predicates: the standard individual identity symbol = and the is one of operator 
. If xi, xj are individual variables, x = y is a well–formed formula. If x is an individual 
variable and xx a plural variable, x  xx is a well–formed formula. 
φ and φ ∧ ψ, ∃xφ
¬
and ∃xxφ are well-formed formulas if φ and ψ are, x is an individual variable and xx is a 
plural variable. Nothing else is a well–formed formula. The deﬁnitions of other Boolean 
connectives are standard. 
Boolos proposed his system as an alternative to second order languages which on 
their face are committed to the existence of sets, and so did not give a set theoretic 
semantics. Such a semantics, however, is easily given.6 An LP–model is a structure 
hD, R, P i where D is a non-empty domain of objects, R is the reference function that 
maps individual variables into D and P is the plural interpretation function which maps 
plural variables into the set of nonempty subsets of D. 7 
4Linnebo, not without a reason, dubbed it a “plural ﬁrst-order” language, but I will avoid calling 
it ‘ﬁrst order’ because in the present context I ﬁnd this wording misleading. Also, I did not introduce 
predicates as a group separate from plural terms. 
5That is, devoid of individual or plural constants. 
6A set–theoretic semantics for LP has been hinted at in (Burgess 2004), without much detail. 
7So we admit “singular pluralities”. This is a fairly standard move. For instance: “In ordinary 
English, it seems that we are entitled to use an expression of the form ‘the φs’ just in case there are 
at least two objects satisfying φ(x). But given our present concerns, it is convenient to relax this 
requirement slightly and demand only that there be at least one object satisfying φ(x). (Most people 
who write on the subject make this concession.)” (Linnebo 2004: sect. 1.2). Burgess (2004: 197), 
on the other hand, takes the ‘zero–or–more’ reading, which makes his logic of plurals very much like 
QNL ε (the main diﬀerence is that he sets up his system axiomatically, whereas QNL is determined by 
its semantics): “. . . taking any one reading as oﬃcial, the other readings can be deﬁned in terms of it; 
so in one important sense it does not matter which reading we take. The ‘zero or more’ reading will be 
adopted here.” (ibid.)

Satisfaction of LP formulas is similar to the satisfaction of QNL ε formulas: 
hD, R, P i
|= xi = xj iﬀ R(xi) = R(xj ) 
(7.5) 
hD, R, P i
|= x  xx iﬀ R(x) ∈ P (xx) 
(7.6) 
hD, R, P i
|= ¬φ iﬀ hD, R, P i 6|= φ 
(7.7) 
hD, R, P i
|= φ ∧ ψ iﬀ hD, R, P i |= φ and hD, R, P i |= ψ 
(7.8) 
hD, R, P i
|= ∃xφ iﬀ hD, R0, P i |= φ 
for some R0 which diﬀers from R at most at x. 
(7.9) 
hD, R, P i
|= ∃xxφ iﬀ hD, R, P 0i |= φ 
for some P 0 which diﬀers from P at most at xx. 
(7.10) 
The expressivity of QNL ε and LP can be quite easily compared. There is a quite 
intuitive uniform translation trans from LP into QNL ε such that for any LP-sentence φ 
and for any LP-model M = hD, R, P i it is possible to generate an S-model M 0 such that 
M |= LP φ iﬀ M 0 |= S trans(φ). Since the model construction depends on our translation, 
let us start with a translation from LP into QNL ε . First, we map individual variables 
x (possibly with subscripts) to variables a (possibly with subscripts). That is, we deﬁne 
a mapping t by: 
t(xi) = ai 
(7.11) 
Similarly we map plural variables xx to variables b: 
t(xxi) = bi 
(7.12) 
Now we map atomic sentences: 
t(xi = xj )
=
(ai ε aj ∧ aj ε ai) = (t(xi) ε t(xj ) ∧ t(xj ) ε t(xi)) 
(7.13) 
t(xi  xxj )
=
(ai ε bj ) = (t(xi) ε t(xxj )) 
(7.14) 

221 
The clauses for complex formulas are: 
t( φ)
= 
(t(φ)) 
(7.15)
¬
¬
t(φ ∧ ψ)
= t(φ) ∧ t(ψ) 
(7.16) 
t(∃xi φ)
= ∃t(xi)(t(xi) ε t(xi) ∧ t(φ)) 
(7.17) 
t(∃xxi φ)
= ∃t(xxi)(∃aa ε t(xxi) ∧ t(φ)) 
(7.18) 
The function t does not provide the translation yet. Here is the clause that deﬁnes the 
translation function trans. Suppose φ is a PL-formula. We can assume that all free 
variables occurring in φ are among a1, . . . , ak, b1, . . . , bm. Then, trans(φ) =: 
(∃aa ε a ∧ a1 ε a1 ∧ . . . ∧ an ε an ∧∃bb ε b1 ∧ . . . ∧∃bb ε bm 
(t(φ))) 
(7.19)
→ 
An S–model M 0 = hD0, I0i is t–generated from an LP–model M = hD, R, P i if and only 
if D = D0, I(ai) = {R(xi)} for any i and I(bj ) = P (xxj ). The basic idea is that the 
antecedent of trans(φ) ensures that (a) the model is non–empty (∃aa ε a), (b) all free ai’s 
refer to exactly one object, and (c) all free bi’s refer to at least one object. 
The following can be proven by induction: 
Theorem 9. For any LP–formula φ, any LP–model M, and any t–generated S–model 
M 0: 
M 0 |= S trans(φ) iﬀ M |= LP φ 
Proof. Consider an arbitrary LP-model hD, R, P i and its t-generated model hD, Ii. For 
any i, j the following holds: 
I(ai) = {R(xi)} 
(7.20) 
I(bj ) = P (xxj ) 
(7.21) 
Notice also that for any LP-formula φ, the antecedent of trans(φ) is satisﬁed in any 
t-generated model. So it is enough to show that an LP-model models a formula φ if and 

222 
only if its t-generated model models t(φ). Consider atomic sentences of LP. Those are 
of two kinds: xi = xj and xi  xxj . Consider the former. First, note: 
t(xi = xj ) = ai ε aj ∧ aj ε ai 
Next, we claim: if hD, R, P i |= xi = xj then hD, Ii |= t(xi = xj ). For indeed assume the 
antecedent. Then R(xi) = R(xj ) and (xi), R(xj ) ∈ D. From (7.20): 
I(ai) = {R(xi)} = {R(xj )} = I(aj ) 
It also follows that 
|I(ai)|=|I(aj )|= 1 
Therefore hD, Ii |= ai ε aj ∧ aj ε ai. So hD, Ii |= t(xi = xj). For the opposite direction 
suppose 
hD, Ii |= t(xi = xj ), i.e. hD, Ii |= ai ε aj ∧ aj ε ai 
This means that the singletons I(ai) and I(aj ) (and they have to be singletons because 
hD, Ii is a t-generated model) are identical. But then (by (7.20)) also R(xi) = R(xj ). 
Consider the second kind of atomic sentences: 
t(xi  xxj ) = ai ε bj 
Suppose hD, R, P i |= xi  xxj . Then R(xi) ∈ P (bj ). Hence R(xi) ∈ I(bj ). So from 
(7.20): |I(ai)|= 1 and I(ai) ⊆ I(bi), that is, hD, Ii |= ai ε bj . Suppose hD, Ii |= ai ε bj . 
This means that |I(ai)|= 1 and I(ai) ⊆ I(bj ). By (7.20, 7.21) {R(xi)} ⊆ P (xxj ), so 
R(xi) ∈ P (xxj ) and therefore hD, R, P i |= xi  xxj . 
The case of Boolean connectives is fairly obvious. Let’s turn to quantiﬁed formulas, 
then. Assume that for any LP-model M the formula φ holds at it if and only if t(φ) 
holds at the M 0 which is t-generated from M. Suppose hD, R, P i |= ∃xi φ. Then there 
is an R0 such that R0 diﬀers from R at most at xi such that hD, R0, P i |= φ. Hence, 

223 
hD, I0i |= t(φ) (where hD, I0i is t-generated from hD, R0, P i). Also, since hD, I0i is a 
t-generated model, |I0(ai)|= 1. Hence hD, I0i |= ai ε ai. Take hD, Ii t-generated from 
hD, R, P i. I0 diﬀers from I at most in what it assigns to ai. So: hD, Ii |= ∃ai (ai ε ai∧t(φ)), 
i.e. hD, Ii |= t(∃xi φ). 
On the other hand, assume hD, Ii |= t(∃xi φ). That is, hD, Ii |= ∃ai (ai ε ai ∧ t(φ)). 
So for some ai-variant of I, I0 : hD, I0i |= ai ε ai ∧ t(φ). Since hD, Ii was a t-generated 
model and I0 assigns to ai a singleton, hD, I0i is also a t-generated model. Take an 
LP-model from which it is generated: hD, R0, P i. Clearly hD, R0, P i |= φ. If hD, R, P i is 
the LP-model from which hD, Ii is t-generated, then R0 diﬀers from R at most in what 
it assigns to xi, and hence hD, R, P i |= ∃xi (φ). 
The argument for the plural quantiﬁer is similar. Assume hD, R, P i |= ∃xxi φ. Then 
there is a model hD, R, P 0i which models φ such that P 0 is an xxi-variant of P . Take 
a model which is t-generated from hD, R, P 0i, hD, I0i. By the induction hypothesis 
hD, I0i |= t(φ). Since I0 is t-generated from R and P 0, it has to assign a non-empty 
subset of D to bi. Hence hD, I0i |= ∃aa ε bi. 8 So hD, I0i |= ∃aa ε bi ∧ t(φ). The model 
t-generated from hD, R, P i, hD, Ii diﬀers from hD, I0i in what it assigns to bi. So 
hD, Ii |= ∃bi (∃aa ε bi ∧ t(φ)), i.e., hD, I |= t(∃xxi φ). 
For the opposite direction, assume hD, Ii is t-generated from hD, R, P i and 
hD, Ii |= t(∃xxi φ), i.e. hD, Ii |= ∃bi (∃aa ε bi ∧ t(φ)). So for some I0 which is a bi-variant of 
I, hD, I0i |= ∃aa ε bi ∧t(φ). But this means that hD, I0i, even if it diﬀers from hD, Ii is still 
a t-generated model (it assigns a non-empty subset of D to the only variable on which 
it possibly diﬀers from hD, Ii). Take the LP-model from which hD, I0i is t-generated, 
hD, R, P 0i. Clearly hD, R, P 0i |= φ (by the induction hypothesis). P 0 diﬀers from P at 
most in what it assigns to xxi. Hence hD, R, P i |= ∃xxi φ. 
8If you are worried about a variable without a subscript, take the ﬁrst subscript j available and take 
∃aj aj ε b.

224 
Notice that in the translation of a formula, the ﬁrst conjunct in the antecedent re­
stricts possible counterexamples to non-empty S–models, all other conjuncts ensure that 
translations of free individual variables of φ are taken to “name” unique objects and 
translations of free plural variables “refer” to a non-empty plurality. For this reason: 
Theorem 10. For any LP–formula φ, φ is LP–valid if and only if trans(φ) is S–valid. 
Proof. This follows from theorem 9. Suppose an LP–formula is not valid. So it fails at 
a certain LP-model, M. But then trans(φ) fails at M’s t-generated model M 0. On the 
other hand suppose trans(φ) is not S-valid. By deﬁnition of validity, it obviously follows 
that it fails at a certain model, N 0. Unfortunately it does not follow that N 0 actually 
is a t–generated model of any LP –model. Hence, we have to show how from N 0 we can 
construct a t–generated model which agrees with N 0 on trans(φ). 
Since N 0 satisﬁes the antecedent of trans(φ) (to falsify a conditional it has to make 
its antecedent true), there is a t-generated model N 00 where trans(φ) fails. Basically 
N 00 assigns to all the relevant variables (variables free in the antecedent of trans(φ)) the 
same subsets of the domain which N 0 assigned to them and then assigns singletons to 
all irrelevant aj ’s and non-empty subsets of the domain to all irrelevant bj ’s. Clearly 
N 00 |= t(φ). Take the LP-model from which N 00 is t-generated, N. By theorem 9, 
N = φ. 
There is an interesting relation that goes the other way round, via monadic second 
order logic (MSOL). The language of MSOL contains a denumerable list of individual 
variables x1, x2, x3, . . ., a denumerable list of predicate variables P1, P2, . . ., Boolean con­
nectives, quantiﬁers binding individual and predicate variables and the identity predicate 
=. An MSOL model is a tuple hD, r, pi where D is a non-empty domain of objects, r is 
a function that maps individual variables to elements of D and p is a function that maps 
predicate letters to subsets of D. 

225 
The notion of satisfaction of MSOL formulas is fairly standard: 
hD, r, pi
|= xi = xj iﬀ r(xi) = r(xj ) 
(7.22) 
hD, r, pi
|= Pi(xj ) iﬀ r(xi) ∈ p(Pi) 
(7.23) 
hD, r, pi
|= ¬φ iﬀ hD, r, pi 6|= φ 
(7.24) 
hD, r, pi
|= φ ∧ ψ iﬀ hD, r, pi |= φ and hD, r, pi |= ψ 
(7.25) 
hD, r, pi
|= ∃xi φ iﬀ hD, r0, pi |= φ 
for some r0 which diﬀers from r at most at xi. 
(7.26) 
hD, r, pi
|= ∃Pi φ iﬀ hD, r, p0i |= φ 
for some p 0 which diﬀers from p at most at Pi. 
(7.27) 
Validity of formulas is just truth in all models. There is a translation tr from the 
language of QNL ε into MSOL which preserves validity. First, we deﬁne the ﬁrst step of 
the translation, the mapping tr. 
tr(ai ε aj )
= ∃x1 (Pi(x1) ∧∀x2 (Pi(x2) → x1 = x2)) ∧∀x3 (Pi(x3) → Pj (x3)) (7.28) 
tr( φ)
= 
tr(φ) 
(7.29)
¬
¬
tr(φ ∧ ψ)
= tr(φ) ∧ tr(ψ) 
(7.30) 
tr(∃ai φ)
= ∃Pi tr(φ) 
(7.31) 
The main diﬀerence between QNL ε and MSOL models is that domains of MSOL models 
are non-empty. The theorem has to include this condition. 
Theorem 11. For any QNL ε formula φ, ∃aa ε a → φ is valid iﬀ tr(φ) is MSOL-valid. 
Proof. Suppose ∃aa ε a 
φ is not S-valid. There is a non-empty model hD, Ii which 
→ 
falsiﬁes it. By induction on the length of a formula it can be shown that the MSOL 
model hD, r, pi such that p(Pi) = I(ai) for any i falsiﬁes tr(φ). Similarly in the opposite 
direction. 

226 
This is relevant to the relation between QNL ε and LP because if one takes standard 
(Boolos’) proof–theoretic formulation of LP and a standard proof theoretic formulation 
of MSOL, there is a translation from MSOL to LP which preserves theoremhood (in both 
directions). See (Linnebo 2004: sect. 1.3) for details. 
It is worth remarking that providing QNL ε or LP with a set–theoretic semantics 
(arguably) deprives them of the expressive power that it has been argued the natural 
language plural quantiﬁcation has. A classical argument is this. The following is intu­
itively true: 
(7.32) 
There are some objects such that all and only those objects that are 
sets and not elements of themselves are among them. 
The following, however, cannot be the case (the sentence states the existence of Russell’s 
set): 
(7.33) There is a set of objects such that all and only those objects that are 
sets and not elements of themselves are elements of it. 
(7.32) seems to state the existence of a certain plurality (the plurality of those objects 
that are sets and not elements of themselves). So, prima facie, there are pluralities 
which are not sets. Hence, quantiﬁcation over pluralities cannot be fully captured by 
interpretation which reads it as quantiﬁcation over sets (or subsets of a domain). 
For now, without any attempt to explain the use of plurals which does not seem to be 
captured by the set–theoretic semantics I will just remark that the expressivity provided 
by the set–theoretic semantics is complex enough to raise problems that will be my main 
concern. 

227 
7.3 Plural quantiﬁcation and ontological commitment 
Before we turn to the question as to whether we are ontologically committed to sets 
when we use QNL ε , a few words of explanation regarding the notion of ontological 
commitment are due. I take (interpreted) theories to be the primary bearers of ontological 
commitment. People become ontologically committed when they accept ontologically 
committed theories. I do not accept Quine’s criterion of ontological commitment: “take 
a ﬁrst-order formulation of a theory — the theory is committed to whatever has to be in 
the range of quantiﬁcation in the resulting ﬁrst-order theory.”9 Unfortunately I do not 
think that there is a “criterion” of ontological commitment that both (i) analyzes our 
intuitions about ontological commitment correctly and (ii) is epistemically more tractable 
than the notion of ontological commitment itself.10 Speciﬁcally, I will discuss the question 
of whether a logic is committed (or commits one) to sets. What is the meaning of the 
phrase ‘a logic commits one to sets’? This means that even if someone’s prior overall 
beliefs did not commit one to sets, one becomes committed to sets when one accepts a 
given logic as a reasonable tool for one’s practical and theoretical purposes. For now, let 
me adopt the following rough–and–ready requirement: a logic is committed to sets if (not 
necessarily iﬀ) its semantics11 requires that certain expression of its language refer to sets 
if its theorems are to be valid. If an equally successful explanation can be given which 
does not require the existence of sets I will say that the logic (with this new semantics) 
does not commit one to sets. 
What I will call the received view is that any higher–order logic bears commitment 
to abstract objects (usually sets). One argument for this conclusion is that higher–order 
logics prove theorems whose content is set–theoretic (or which are valid if and only if 
certain theorems of set theory are true), and since set theory is committed to abstract 
9I mostly agree with the criticism of this sort of approach to be found in (Chihara 1973, 1990)). 
10Although the issue lies beyond the scope of my present considerations. 
11And I take a logic to be given together with a semantics, more remarks on this issue will follow. 

228 
objects (sets), so is the logic. I will get back to arguments of this sort. Before I do that, 
however, I will consider another possible way of defending the same view. One could 
imagine someone arguing as follows. 
Whenever we present a logical system we have to provide it with a formal 
semantics for it that we ﬁnd adequate. When we use a logical system with 
a certain semantics we are committed to whatever the quantiﬁers of the lan­
guage of the system under considerations range over according to the se­
mantics we provided. The logic of plurals (or QNL ε, for that matter) can 
have two kinds of semantics: a set–theoretic semantics (discussed before) or 
a substitutional semantics. QNL ε with substitutional semantics is not theo­
retically satisfactory. Therefore it has to be given a set–theoretic semantics. 
But on the set–theoretic reading of plural quantiﬁers, they range over subsets 
of a domain. Subsets of a domain are abstract objects and hence whenever 
we use the logic of plurals we are committed to abstract objects. 
Let us dub arguments that go along these lines semantical arguments for the claim 
that higher order quantiﬁcation commits one to abstract objects. 
I have not met an argument formulated exactly this way, but it seems that the ten­
dency can be traced back at least to Quine. In (1947) he remarks that any usage of general 
terms in the context of quantiﬁcation commits one to abstract objects (pp. 74–75), and 
he explicitly says about quantiﬁers binding predicate letters: 
If we bind the schematic predicate–letters of quantiﬁcation theory, we achieve 
a reiﬁcation of universals which no device analogous to Fitch’s is adequate 
to explaining away. These universals are entities whereof predicates may 
thenceforward be regarded as names; they may be construed as attributes or 
as classes . . . The predicate letters, when thus admitted to quantiﬁers, acquire 

229 
the status of variables taking classes as values. (pp. 77-78) 
He is even more explicit when he discusses Le´sniewski’s Ontology (Quine 1952: 141). 
There, he criticizes Ajdukiewicz and Le´sniewski for not attaching suﬃcient signiﬁcance 
to the fact that “the variables which have been said to stand in places appropriate 
to general terms are subjected in Le´sniewski’s theory to quantiﬁcation.” This theory, 
according to Quine, “. . . surely commits Le´sniewski to a realm of values of his variables 
of quantiﬁcation; and all his would–be general terms must be viewed as naming these 
values singly.” Quite rhetorically Quine claims that if this quantiﬁcation is not to be 
read as committing Le´sniewski to classes, then he is “at a loss to imagine wherein such 
commitment even on the part of a professing Platonist can consist”.12 
Quine’s argument is, however, slightly diﬀerent from the one I gave. He is already 
assuming that being subjected to quantiﬁcation automatically carries ontological commit­
ment, and instead of explicitly discussing the need for semantics and how what semantics 
we choose can impact our ontological commitment he insists that sentences should be 
put in their standard ﬁrst–order form.13 
A train of thought which more explicitly relies on the relevance of the choice of a 
12On Le´sniewski’s view, ontological commitments are made by using the ε operator, we can guess 
what the answer to Quine’s question would Le´sniewski give. For Le´sniewski, one would be committed 
to abstract objects if, for instance, she accepted a theory which entails ‘for some a, a is (where ‘is’ has 
the same meaning as ε ) a set (where ‘set’ is given a meaning that at least entails that sets are abstract 
object), or if she uttered something like ‘at least one object is a set’ (where the quantiﬁcation is not 
ranging over sets, and the form of the statement is ‘∃aa ε Set’). 
13Quine (1970: 66-67) gave yet another argument. In ordinary ﬁrst–order quantiﬁcations (like the one 
expressed by ‘(∃x)(x walks)’) the open sentence displays a variable in a position where a name could 
stand. The quantiﬁed sentences are not read as quantifying over names: they rather quantify over objects 
that could be named by a name placed in the position of a variable. Similarly when we bind predicate 
variable, we “treat predicate positions suddenly as name positions, and hence . . . treat predicates as 
names of entities of some sort.” This argument has been dealt with by Boolos (1998b: 37-39), who 
points out that to put a predicate variable in a quantiﬁer may require that the variable be treated as 
having a range but we do not have to treat predicate positions as name positions just because ordinary 
individual variables do so. Boolos’s discussion in 1998b, however, is not concerned with what I want to 
discuss. He was arguing against Quine’s claim that second–order logic is set theory in sheep’s clothing, 
which is a stronger claim than that second–order logic is committed to sets. Even Boolos admits that 
“There is a clear sense . . . in which second–order logic can at least be said to be committed to the 
assertion that an empty set exists.” (Boolos 1998b: 47). 

230 
semantics can be found in (Burgess 2004: 217): 
. . . if a model theory has not yet been developed of a given logical notion, it 
may be alleged that the notion is ‘meaningless’ because it lacks a ‘semantics’. 
On the other hand, once a model theory has been developed for a given 
logical notion it may be alleged that problematic ‘ontological commitments’ 
are implicit in the use of the notion. . . 
Let us return to the semantical argument. The reasoning can be blocked by rejecting 
one of the premises. Which one can we reasonably reject, if we have strong nominalist 
inclinations? Consider the ﬁrst premise: 
(7.34) 
For any logical system a formal semantics is needed. 
We could try rejecting this one. One way of reading Boolos is that he thinks plural 
quantiﬁcation is primitive and it is intuitively clear that it does not commit its user to 
classes.14 He does develop a certain semantics where plural variables are not interpreted 
as taking classes as values, but this is a wholly diﬀerent issue. When he does that, he 
is already assuming the existence of sets and attempts to use plural quantiﬁcation as an 
alternative to taking second–order set-theoretic variables to range over (possibly) proper 
classes.15 
14He says: “ “There are some critics etc.” doesn’t, it seems, commit us, in any ordinary sense of the 
word “commit,” to the existence of a class of critics; what it commits us to, one would have thought, 
is, as we have noted, some critics none of whom etc. We are forced by Quine’s criterion to say that it 
commits us to a class; but why, we should ask, should we accept the criterion? If it is answered: because 
it’s Quine’s phrase, and he is at liberty to deﬁne it as he pleases, then we should rejoin: if so, Quine 
is deﬁning a relation which holds between us and certain objects (in this case, classes) whose existence 
the normal use of our word does not force us to admit, and hence a relation that ought not to be called 
“ontological commitment” . . . The statements do not appear to commit us to classes; why believe that 
it is their translation into the notation of ﬁrst–order logic augmented with variables ranging over classes 
that determines what they are actually committed to?” (Boolos 1998a: 77-78) 
15This does not mean that ordinarily second-order variables range over proper classes. It is rather 
the peculiarity of second-order set theory that Boolos is considering as an alternative to his set theory 
that its ﬁrst-order variables range over sets and second–order variables range over (possibly proper) 
classes. “In the case of a second–order language, such as the second–order language of set theory, there 
are at least two diﬀerent sorts of truth–theory that can be given: on one of these, it would be quite 
natural to deﬁne “value” so that the second–order variables would turn out to have classes as values [. . . ] 

231 
Similarly, Le´sniewski might be interpreted as treating his quantiﬁcation as primitive. 
He did not develop any semantics for his systems and there is no textual evidence as to 
him providing a clear account of his quantiﬁers. Burgess (2004: 217) seems to be taking 
the same primitivist position: 
. . . I maintain that even if no one ever did present a satisfactory model theory 
for plural logic, the plural was in systematic use in natural languages long 
before model theory for anything had been born or thought, and such long– 
standing systematic usages are meaningful if anything is. 
Quite likely Burgess is right when he says that logical devices can be meaningful even 
if they have not been given a semantical account. In the end, people constructed and 
used logical systems long before the notion of a formal semantics had been developed. It 
does not, however, mean that it is good practice nowadays to construct logical systems 
without providing them with a formal account of the meaning of the devices used in those 
systems. Formal semantics of various systems perform important theoretical tasks. Even 
if having a formal semantics does not have to make a diﬀerence between the meaningless 
and the meaningful, a semantics certainly clariﬁes the meaning of logical devices (like 
quantiﬁers). Having a formal semantics of a system allows us to get a better handle 
on what the system works like and on all the interesting properties that a system may 
have with respect to this semantics. One can hardly deny that the completeness of ﬁrst– 
order logic, the completeness of second–order logic with respect to Henkin semantics 
or the incompleteness of standard second–order logic are important properties of those 
logics and that these results provide us with a certain insight into the nature of those 
systems.16 Even more importantly, some sort of explanation is needed when the pluralist 
The present theory, however, makes no explicit mention of sequences whose values are (proper classes). 
It does not proceed by introducing functions that assign to each second-order variable a unique class, 
possibly proper.” (Boolos 1998a: 78–81). 
16Simons (1985b: 196-197) raises a similar question: does Ontology need a formal semantics? His 
answer is positive, but his argument is diﬀerent. He says that even if the expressions of Ontology are 

232 
(i.e. a proponent of the logic of plurals) who claims that she is not committed to abstract 
objects is challenged by the Platonist. If instead of providing a clear account of how plural 
quantiﬁcation is to be understood and why it does not commit one to abstract objects 
she says that it is primitive and people have been using it for ages, she practically refuses 
to join the discussion and they reach an impasse. Hence, it seems that we have good 
reasons to accept (7.34). 
Consider now the second premise: 
(7.35) 
If we use a certain logical system and believe that a certain semantics 
is an adequate semantics of this language, we are committed to whatever lies 
in the range(s) of quantiﬁcation according to this semantics. 
This, on the face of it, is quite uncontroversial. When we give a semantics that explains 
truth–conditions of a sentence in terms of (some sort of) semantic role of its constituents 
and we believe that the semantics explains them adequately, we must be convinced that 
we got the role of the constituents right. Hence, prima facie, if we provide our logic 
with a simple substitutional semantics with a determinate class of substituents we are 
committed to their existence. If, on the other hand, we give a set–theoretic semantics 
for second–order logic, it seems, we are committed to sets. It does not mean, of course, 
that whenever one uses set–theoretic semantics for second–order logic one is committed 
to sets. It is only when one claims that this is an adequate semantics of that language 
(one that explains correctly the semantic role of expressions of the language) that the 
semantics has to be taken seriously.17 
meaningful, “a theory of a language . . . is incomplete if it does not include . . . an account of what their 
being meaningful consists in”, and that is why a theory of Ontology should be enriched with a semantics. 
To my mind, this is more of a restatement of the claim that is being argued for than a real argument. 
17The notion of ‘adequacy’ as used here is somewhat vague, so a few words of explanation. Its use 
mirrors the distinction between what happens when one employs a certain mathematical theory to pro­
vide a formal semantics for a system but nevertheless treats it more like a mathematically interesting or 
inspiring exercise rather than an explanation of what certain constituents of the subject language mean, 
and what happens when one uses certain mathematical theory to explain the meaning of those devices. 
The point is, a nominalist could still play the game of giving set–theoretic semantics for second–order 

233 
There is a small catch here. The substitutional semantics commits one to names 
only if the way it is formulated requires that there be (in a model) a determined set of 
substituents. On the other hand, a substitutional semantics where variables range over 
certain possible expressions does not obviously commit one to their existence, just like 
saying that there is a possibility of error does not commit one to the existence of possible 
errors. I will get back to this issue later. Qualms about ontological commitments raised 
by substitutional semantics are not deeply relevant for the argument under discussion, for 
one of the premises excludes the possibility that the semantics for QNL ε be substitutional 
and the argument rests on the belief that standard, referential, set–theoretic semantics 
for QNL ε commits one to sets. 
The next premise is: 
(7.36) 
The logic of plurals (and QNL ε for that matter) can have only two 
kinds of semantic: substitutional or set–theoretic. 
What are we to make of this claim? Instead of getting into a philosophical discussion 
regarding non-standard interpretation of the logic of plurals, let us just charitably note 
that these two semantics are usually thought to be two main candidates to the position 
of a formal account of how LP is to be understood. In other words, let us just grant 
this assumption.18 This approach towards the distinction between the substitutional and 
logic without taking it too seriously. This would provide him with interesting mathematical considera­
tions, which would be nevertheless devoid of explanatory power as far as the meaning that he attaches 
to higher–order quantiﬁers goes. 
18In the substitutional semantics a model can be taken to be a set of substituents (thought of as 
constants that can be substituted for variables) together with a valuation function that determines the 
truth–value of atomic sentences constructed from available predicates and terms belonging to the class 
of substituents. Then, the quantiﬁcation is explained in terms of truth–value of those atomic sentences. 
For instance, ∃aa ε a would be true if there were a term t in the class of substituents such that the value 
of t ε t would be Truth. It is not really obvious if this sort of substitutional semantics really explains the 
truth–conditions of sentences. I feel some sympathy for Quine’s remark about substitutional semantics: 
“Ontology is thus meaningless for a theory whose only quantiﬁcation is substitutionally construed; 
meaningless, that is, insofar, as the theory is considered in and of itself. The question of its ontology 
makes sense only relative to some translation of the theory into a background theory in which we use 
referential quantiﬁcation.” (Quine 1968: 210) Perhaps, a translation into a language with referential 
quantiﬁcation is not needed, but certainly I understand how a semantics which does not explain truth– 

234 
the referential interpretation of quantiﬁers is quite common. For instance Kearns (1969: 
165–166) says: 
I feel that one can distinguish two fundamentally diﬀerent ways of regarding 
variables– I will call these two views of variables. The ﬁrst view I call the 
Russell–Quine view; the second is the Frege–Le´sniewski view (these will be 
abbreviated as R–Q and F–L, respectively). These two are not the only pos­
sible views, but I feel that they are the two basic views; other views will be 
variants of one or the other, or perhaps combinations of the two. . . The R–Q 
view of variables could be called the pronoun view of variables. Professor 
Quine has compared the use of variables with many uses of pronouns in En­
glish; however, he views pronouns as more fundamental than nouns. . . On the 
R–Q view, quantiﬁers are used to talk about all entities or some entity. . . On 
the F–L view, a variable is seen as a replacement for an expressions. Variables 
do not have ranges of values, where each value is an entity of some kind.19 
Let’s now discuss the last premise: 
(7.37) 
Substitutional semantics for QNL ε is not theoretically satisfactory. 
Why exactly should we accept it? There is a classical paper which discusses substitutional 
interpretation of quantiﬁers in Ontology (K¨ung and Canty 1970). The authors argue that 
Ontology cannot be given substitutional semantics, and since they focus on the part of 
Ontology which resembles QNL ε (i.e. they discuss quantiﬁcation over name variables 
conditions of atomic sentences can be philosophically frustrating. 
19I do not think that Kearns is exactly right crediting the substitutional reading to Le´sniewski; it 
seems that his interpretation relies on a mistranslation. Le´sniewski in the passage Kearns refers to 
explains how he used quantiﬁers when he “did not yet know how to operate with quantiﬁers.” It 
is therefore not sure whether this is how he understood his formal quantiﬁers once he had them. Also, 
he wrote “przy pewnym znaczeniu wyrazu”, which translates as “for some meaning of the expression” 
(Le´sniewski 1927: 203). Kearns translates the phrase as “for some signiﬁcant words” (which would be 
“dla pewnego wyrazu posiadaj¸acego znaczenie” or “dla pewnego znacz¸acego wyrazu” in Polish) and 
takes it to be Le´sniewski’s explanation of his formal quantiﬁers. 

235 
only), their arguments, if compelling, mutatis mutandi apply to QNL ε . How do they 
argue? They discuss those substitutional interpretations that they ﬁnd possible and 
reject them one by one. Here is how they proceed. 
Actual inscriptions. Suppose the quantiﬁcation ranges over actual inscriptions. 
For instance: 
∀a,b(a ε b →∃cc ε a) 
(7.38) 
they read as: “for any two names (nominal inscriptions), if the sentence (sentential 
inscription) in which one name is subject and the other predicate, is true, then there is 
some name contained in a sentence which is true in which this name is the subject and 
a name equiform to the subject of the ﬁrst sentence is the predicate”. 
Note that some sort of equivalence relation (e.g. equiformity) is necessary here. This 
point might be made clearer when we consider the following sentence: 
∀a(a ε a ∨¬a ε a) 
If every occurrence of a in the formula was to stand for one and the same inscription 
the sentence would be true under no substitution, for no single token can occur at more 
than one place. It also seems that the way the authors read the formula is still ﬂawed. 
For suppose we have a name a which does not occur in any sentence. In that case there 
is no such a thing as the sentence in which a is a subject. “Stand–alone” names would 
lie outside the range of quantiﬁcation on this reading. Probably what they had in mind 
was more like ‘for any two names a and b, if an actual sentence a0 ε b0 is true and a0 is 
equiform to a and b0 is equiform to b, then there is a name c such that there is a true 
sentence c ε a00 and a00 is equiform to a. Also, we have to be aware of the usual qualms 
about equiformity.20 If the quantiﬁed variables refer to equiform names indistinctively 
(i.e. for any formula of the language φ(a) its substitution instance φ(t) is true if and only 
20The authors do not deﬁne the notion and take it to be primitive. 

236 
if for any t0 which is equiform with t, the substitution instance φ(t0) is true), the language 
cannot contain names that are equiform but diﬀer in their reference (which means that 
natural languages are not good candidates). Or, one would have to construct a more 
ﬁne–grained relation of equiformity, where only those “geometrically equiform” names 
which have the same “lexical entries” can be really equiform.21 Let’s not dwell on this 
now, suppose that we have answered the qualms about equiformity. Then, still, as the 
authors claim, we run into troubles. 
The fact that a certain actually written sentence logically implies a sentence (which 
in this reading requires that there be a certain inscription) does not ensure that such a 
sentence indeed exist. For instance, even if a sentence mentioned in the antecedent of 
(7.38) exists (for instance, ‘Russell ε philosopher’, if we grant that we can take substi­
tution instances from natural languages), it does not follow that there actually exists a 
sentence which would result from ‘c ε Russell’ by substituting a name for c. 
A slight modiﬁcation of this reading would not require the existence of sentences. It 
would be enough that name inscriptions exist and refer. For instance, (7.38) would be 
rendered as: for any actually existing name inscriptions a and b, if a ε b (that is, if a refers 
to a unique object which is among the objects to which b refers), then there is an actual 
name inscription c such that it refers to a unique object which is one of the objects to 
which a refers. On this reading, the formula would be valid (because the existence claim 
in the consequent is warranted by the existence of a itself). This certainly simpliﬁes 
the semantics and ﬁxes some of the diﬃculties. The problem is that any theory which 
requires that the domain be at least denumerable (like Peano arithmetic, for instance) 
will fail on this reading since the number of existing inscriptions is very likely ﬁnite.22 
Since a very important theoretical purpose of logical systems like Ontology (or systems 
21That is, being “geometrically equiform” would be a necessary but not a suﬃcient condition. The 
necessary and suﬃcient condition for two expressions to be equiform would be something like “they are 
geometrically equiform and they are synonymous”. 
22Unless we accept wild philosophical views, like Lewis’s modal realism or something similar. 

237 
based on the logic of plurals) is to develop a formalization of mathematical discourse, 
if we give QNL ε a substitutional semantics of this sort it will fall short of providing us 
with the framework that we need. 
Logically possible inscriptions. Having abandoned the actualist substitutional 
reading the authors then consider the idea that Le´sniewskian quantiﬁers range over “log­
ically possible inscriptions” (p. 174). An existentially quantiﬁed statement would be 
satisﬁed iﬀ there were a logically possible inscription which would satisfy the require­
ments put on it by the content of the formula. As they quite correctly notice, there is a 
problem with explicating the notion of logically possible inscriptions. They make a valid 
negative point that logical possibility should not be identiﬁed with physical possibility.23 
As for the positive part, they focus ﬁrst on the reading on which logically possible names 
are those that either actually exist or can be introduced according to the Le´sniewskian 
rule of deﬁnition.24 This initially plausible reading is nevertheless not very satisfactory: 
But in ontology proper only two name constants are deﬁnable, the empty 
name and the universal name, just as in Boolean algebra only two non– 
23In a way, Le´sniewski’s metalogic seems to require a modal approach as well. (Kearns 1962: 11) 
says about Le´sniewski’s terminological explanations (which I discuss in section 4.6): ‘The T.E.s are like 
blueprints — they present the rules for as many systems as one cares to construct. For Lesniewski, 
a formal system exists in space and time, and it contains just those results which have actually been 
deduced. This means that there are no unproved theorems of a formal system. However, such a claim 
does not make proofs of completeness and consistency either trivial or senseless. For these must be 
understood as proofs about all possible well–formed formulas or theorems, rather than as about some 
ideal individuals. The problem of potentiality, or possibility, is a diﬀerent problem from that relating 
to abstract entities. Potential objects and events are quite as individual as actual ones. To say that 
every well–formed formula which can be constructed will either be provable or contradictory is not to say 
anything which commits one to recognizing the formal system containing the theorems.’ [the emphasis 
is Kearns’] 
24In QNL ε we could introduce a rule of deﬁnition in the following form. First we extend the alphabet 
by a denumerable number of name constants δ1, δ2, . . . and modify the syntax accordingly. Next, we 
enumerate all QNL ε formulas which do not contain name constants and contain exactly one free variable: 
φ1, φ2, . . .. Then we introduce as axioms all formulas of the form: 
∀a[a ε δi ≡ a ε a ∧ φi(a)] 
and in any model we take δi to denote the set of all and only those objects whose singular names would 
satisfy φi. 

238 
equivalent constants are distinguishable. (p. 177) 
Depending on how one distinguishes name constants, the claim may be true or false. 
On one reading, there are only two constants deﬁnable (suppose we reasonably extend 
S-semantics to allow constants to denote) if in any S-model any deﬁnable constant will 
denote one of certain two subsets of the domain. For instance, if in any model any deﬁned 
constant will denote the empty set or the whole domain of the model, we can (in the 
sense just speciﬁed) say that at most two constants are deﬁnable. In this sense, the above 
claim is true. On the other hand, if what we mean by ‘diﬀerent constants’ is ‘constants 
which are not logically equivalent’, that is, constants such that there is a model where 
they denote diﬀerent subsets of the domain, there are more than two constants. It is the 
second meaning of ‘diﬀerence between constants’ that led Rickey (1985: 186) to criticize 
the above statement. Let us take a look at his argument. 
He suggests that there are other, non–equivalent constants that can be deﬁned in 
Ontology (which are also deﬁnable in QNL ε ). His example is: 
∀a(a ε 2+ ≡ a ε a ∧∃b,c(a ε b ∧ a ε c ∧¬ b ◦ c)) 
(7.39) 
where b
c stands for ∀d(d ε b ≡ d ε c). Further, he claims the following. Take a model 
◦ 
which contains exactly three objects (say, 1, 2, 3) such that a refers to exactly one of 
them (say, 2), b refers to two objects: 1 and 2, and c refers to two objects: 2 and 3. Then, 
he insists, 2+ is a constant diﬀerent from both: the empty (Λ) and the full (V ) name. 
The adequacy of this claim depends on what is meant by ‘distinct constants’. First, 
constants that have diﬀerent shape can be introduced which have logically equivalent 
deﬁnientes. This diﬀerence, however is not strong enough to provide us with the expres­
sivity we need. Second, constants that have deﬁnientes which are not logically equivalent 
can also be introduced (and here ﬁts the diﬀerence between 2+ and Λ). The initial worry 
about the fact that only Λ and V are deﬁnable was that on this sort of substitutional read­

239 
ing the satisfaction of complex formulas will depend only on what is true or false about 
the empty set or about the whole domain, that is, only the empty set or the whole domain 
would, in a sense, lie in the range of name variables (in a sense, this is the semantical 
version of the claim that there are not enough constants). The question is: do constants 
introduced according to Rickey’s recipe (2+ , 3+ , 4+, etc.) ﬁx the problem? Well, what 
objects exactly fall under 2+ in Rickey’s model? In the substitutional interpretation it 
is somewhat hard to decide what this question means.25 A plausible reading is this. On 
this understanding of substitutional interpretation, an object x from the model described 
by Rickey falls under 2+ in that model if and only if, if we introduce a singular term a 
denoting an object x, then the description of the model makes a ε 2+ true. Let’s extend 
the language with singular terms: ‘1’, ‘2’ and ‘3’ denoting objects 1, 2 and 3 respectively. 
Take 1. Certainly 1 ε 1. Also, 1 ε b and 1 ε V . Thus ∃b,c(a ε b ∧ a ε c ∧¬ b
c). Hence
◦ 
1 ε 2+ . Similar arguments work for 2 and 3. Thus, in Rickey’s model 2+ has the same 
denotation as V . In general, any constant of the kind described by Rickey of the form n+ 
(where is a natural number) will denote the same as V in any model which has at least 
n elements and the same as Λ in any model which has less than n elements. Extending 
the language with logically non-equivalent constants deﬁned in accordance with Rickey’s 
recipe does not provide us with a way out. 
K¨ung and Canty propose a yet wider notion of logical possibility of constants. First, 
they remark that even though certain constants cannot be deﬁned in the language of 
Ontology, they can be introduced axiomatically. 
. . . new constants can be added to Ontology not only by means of deﬁnitions, 
but also by means of new axioms (K¨ung and Canty 1970: 177) 
25The problem here is that on the classical reading “substitutional quantiﬁcation is not grounded 
in assignments of objects at all.” (Marcus 1972: 248) Rickey, on the other hand, quite interestingly, 
wants to have his pie and eat it: to interpret quantiﬁcation substitutionally but assign denotation to 
substituents. It is not impossible (in fact, I will be trying to do something similar), but this makes the 
semantics far from being purely substitutional. 

240 
This of course is a little bit tricky, because it is not obvious what conditions have to 
be put on an axiomatic system in order for it to really introduce a new constant. If 
what one cares about is only that introduction of new constants preserves consistency it 
is enough to add axioms saying that a new constant is not coextensive with any other 
constant. If, on the other hand, one believes that a new constant is really introduced if 
the axioms together with rules of inference determine the semantical interpretation of the 
new expression, things can get fairly complex. Fortunately we will not have to get into 
this issue too far, because, arguably, no matter how exactly axioms will introduce new 
constants, we still will run out of constants. We may safely assume that any constant 
would be introduced my means of a single formula or a single axiom schema (say, the 
conjunction of those axioms and/or axiom schemas which would introduce it). But this 
implies there are at most denumerably many formulas (or schemas) that introduce a 
new constant. This indicates that it will be hard to run certain mathematical theories. 
For instance, it will be very hard to mimic the quantiﬁcation over real numbers using 
this sort of substitutional reading. Also, even if the domain of objects is denumerable, 
the substitutional interpretation will give us a diﬀerent result than the set–theoretic 
one, because there will be more subsets of the domain than possible names. Let us 
call the arguments against any substitutional interpretation of higher–order (or plural) 
quantiﬁcation which in one way or another suggest that since the class of substituents 
is at most countable (and this constitutes a problem because we do not have any upper 
limit on the size of the domain of objects to be named) size limitation objections. 
Here, K¨ung and Canty end the list of what they consider acceptable approaches to 
the substitutional quantiﬁcation26 and go on to suggest that. . . 
26I discussed their arguments because they focus on arguments against substitutional interpretation 
of higher order logics speciﬁcally and they cover most of the interpretations that usually come to one’s 
mind. As for general qualms about substitutional interpretation I believe they have been dealt with by 
Kripke (1976). I will just allow myself to discuss brieﬂy an objection raised against the substitutional 
interpretation (not necessarily higher–order) by Tomberlin (1997). The argument is intriguing, and 
it is interesting to see how languages based on QNL ε avoid the diﬃculty. It goes (p. 160): On the 

241 
one must further consider the set of all subsets of that domain. Here, one 
assigns to each constant from the category of names some element from this 
set: call it the extension of the name to which it is assigned. Under any in­
terpretation of ontology, every name is to have some extensions . . . the names 
do not denote their extensions, they merely have their extensions. (p 178) 
and this is where we leave them. The problem is that extensions thus understood are 
prima facie nominalistically unacceptable, and the authors do not provide any argument 
to the eﬀect that they are not.27 
The last premise (i.e. (7.37)) of the semantical argument is the one that I will reject. 
To do that, I will provide an explanation of quite a clear and intuitive notion of possibility 
which provides us with a suﬃcient repertoire of possible names and I provide a viable 
substitutional interpretation. Before doing that, I will discuss two other proposals that 
substitutional reading a sentence of the form ∀xF (x) is true iﬀ all substitution instances of Fx are true 
(where F is given a ﬁxed interpretation). But ‘the unique non–F’ is a legitimate substituent (terms do not 
have to be non–empty to be rightful substituents). Unfortunately, the sentence ‘F (the unique non–F )’ 
will always be false. Hence, the sentence ‘∀xF (x)’ will never be true, because it will always have at least 
one false substitution instance. One might object to this version of the argument on the grounds that 
deﬁnite descriptions are incomplete symbols and as such are not legitimate substituents. Tomberlin has 
a rejoinder here: he can introduce ‘Scotty’ as a non–referential name, and ﬁx its denotation, if it were 
to have one as the one and only individual that is not F and run the argument with ‘Scotty’ instead of 
the deﬁnite description that he used originally. Nevertheless, it seems that the problem does not arise 
for QNL ε even if we admit deﬁnite descriptions as rightful substituents. 
First, how do we express the sentence that all objects have a certain property, or, when we speak 
QNL ε , that all objects fall under a certain name, say a? Certainly not by ‘ ∀bb ε a’, because this 
will always be false (the substitution instance ‘Λ ε a’ is false). Rather, we say that any object is a, 
‘ ∀b(b ε b → b ε a)’. But consider the substitution instance that we get when we substitute ‘the unique 
non–a’ for b: 
If the unique non–a is the unique non–a, then the unique non–a is a. 
If there are no objects which are not a (or if there are at least two such objects), the descriptions fails 
to denote and the sentence comes out vacuously true. If, on the other hand, there is a unique object 
which is not a, then the sentence also gets the correct truth–value, for it is true that the unique non–a 
is the unique non–a but false that it is a. 
27They remark that “A Le´sniewskian system . . . has the advantage that it is at least as powerful as any 
Russellian system without admitting sets into the universe of discourse; that is, without putting, say, 
real things and sets . . . into the same universe. The sets are here recognized as purely linguistic entities, 
which play their role as extensions in the range of quantiﬁcation, not in the universe of discourse.” 
(p. 179) but this looks more like mere verbalism than like a real explanation. The reader is still left 
with the idea that sets have to be in the range in quantiﬁcation and has no idea as to how they are to 
be explained away by saying that they are ‘purely linguistic entities’. 

242 
quite naturally lead to the approach I want to suggest. 
7.4 A modal alternative 
In this section I will ﬁrst present and discuss two approaches to plural quantiﬁcation which 
were meant to provide semantical insight into the logic in question without bringing in 
ontological commitment to abstract objects. Next, I will develop a semantics (motivated 
by these attempts) which avoids the diﬃculties that will be raised against these two 
approaches. 
7.4.1 Simons on combinatorial semantics 
Simons (1985b) suggested that we can think of Le´sniewskian quantiﬁers as ranging over 
ways of meaning (a phrase he coined). He did not deﬁne the notion of a way of 
meaning, but he certainly tried to clarify it. The intuition is that a way of meaning of an 
expression is that part of the semantical character of this expression which contributes to 
the truth of complex sentences (of the extensional language of Ontology). Two examples: 
the way of meaning of ‘Rafal Urbaniak’ is that it refers to only one object, me. The way 
of meaning of the Boolean conjunction is that only when applied to two true sentences 
it yields a true sentence. 
First of all, we are told, in the present context we have to consider only extensional 
aspects of ways of meaning. Hence his ﬁrst postulate: 
(7.40) 
Coextensive expressions mean in the same way. 
Also, the grammatical diﬀerences are supposed to “represent” diﬀerences in reference 
(denotation): 
(7.41) 
No two expressions of diﬀerent semantic category can mean in the 

243 
28
same way.
In other words, two expressions which could mean in the same way, possess the same 
mode of meaning and expressions in diﬀerent sematic category never have the same 
mode of meaning (Two expressions can have the same mode of meaning and yet have 
diﬀerent ways of meaning). 
(7.42) Expressions have the same mode of meaning iﬀ they are of the same 
semantic category. 
(7.42) is not a deﬁnition. It only speciﬁes that the way Ontology is constructed its 
grammar mirrors the distinction between diﬀerent modes of meaning. Then we have two 
principles associated with compositionality: 
(7.43) 
The way of meaning of a complex expression is determined by the 
ways of meaning of its constituents. 
(7.44) 
The mode of meaning of a functor expression is determined by the 
modes of meaning of its arguments and values. 
Now Simons has to specify the mode of meaning of expressions of primitive syntactic 
categories: 
(7.45) 
The mode of meaning of sentences is to be true or false 
(7.46) 
The mode of meaning of names is to designate. 
Among the ways of meaning that names can have, Simons distinguishes certain sub-
modes; there are lots of submodes but those interesting from the present perspective 
are designating no/at least n/exactly n/at most n/all objects, etc. 
28Simons is using Le´sniewski’s terminology, so he speaks of ‘semantic category’. In Ontology, however, 
the category of an expression is determined syntactically. Le´sniewski called it ‘semantic’ because he 
introduced syntactic diﬀerences in order to mirror diﬀerences in what he considered the semantic role of 
expressions. 

244 
An example. Suppose we consider an expression which syntactically is a two–place 
propositional connective (or suppose we are considering a variable of the same syntactic 
category and ask ourselves what the range of quantiﬁcation is). How many ways of 
meaning does it have? Well, a way of meaning for a propositional connective is speciﬁed 
by its output for each possible input, we are told. There are 2n possible inputs, and 
since there are two possible outputs, there are 22n possible ways of meaning of such a 
propositional connective. 
The way of meaning of a name constant is speciﬁed by determining what objects it 
refers to. Simons represents ways of meaning of expressions of propositional logic by 
means of tables (and this is doable, because they would always be ﬁnite objects), and 
suggests that this method can be somehow extended to ways of meaning that names 
have. For this purpose he introduces designation tables. For instance, if there are two 
objects in the domain: A, B there are four ways a name could mean and we can represent 
those ways of meaning by a, b,—, and ab respectively: 
Does it denote: 
a 
b 
— 
ab 
A? 
B? 
Yes 
No 
No 
Yes 
No 
No 
Yes Yes 
Then, suppose we want to specify the way ε means in that model: 

245

The idea is that quantiﬁcation ranges over ways of meanings (e.g. if a is the only free 
variable in φ(a), the sentence ∀aφ(a) is satisﬁed in a model if and only if for any way of 
meaning a can have φ(a) is true in that model), Simons suggests, and such quantiﬁcation 
does not commit one to the existence of objects which are ways of meaning. Simons, 
somewhat mysteriously, remarks: 
Note again that the inputs and outputs of these semantic tables are not 
expressions or any other objects connected directly with a particular language. 
They are ways of meaning. (Simons 1985b: 208)

He believes that ways of meaning cannot be actual objects, because “there are more 
ways of meaning than there objects to be named” (p. 212). The argument is not deeply 
satisfactory. It seems that a certain ambiguity is involved. In one sense an object has 
to be an element of the domain of things that names can name. On this reading, we 
probably do not want to treat ways of meanings as objects, that is, we do not want to 
consider possible names which name ways of meaning as admissible substituents for name 
variables. In the other sense (which probably is more essential here) ways of meaning are 
actual objects if they really exist. The claim that ways of meaning are not objects in the 
ﬁrst sense (likely true) does not entail that they are not objects in the second sense. The 
ﬁrst claim is only about a certain limit on what names can refer to in a certain (possibly 
formal) language. The second claim is general and metaphysical. 
Even if we admit that ways of meaning are not objects, we are left wondering: what 
are they? A few postulates given by Simons or the fact that some of them (those which 
are generated from a ﬁnite domain of “urelements”) can be represented by a table do not 
provide a philosophical explanation of their status. There is also a technical diﬃculty 
here. Unless we represent tables set–theoretically, a formal semantics which would employ 
tables that list objects, inputs and outputs would be quite unmanageable. 
What is more, even if we assume that tables adequately represent ways names could 
mean in a model, it is impossible to express the meaning of ε. For note that the best 
that a table can do is to express the way ε means (and this works also only in ﬁnite 
models). But what we want to have is not a description of ε relativized to a particular 
model. We want to understand ε independently of our choice of models. This meaning, 
however, cannot be expressed using the table method. 

247 
7.4.2 Rickey’s natural models 
After a simple reformulation (accommodating it to QNL ε ), Rickey’s natural semantics 
(Rickey 1985) is a model theory for QNL ε which, he believed, does not commit one to 
sets when one uses the system. The basic idea is that we take names to belong to a 
distinct set of objects existing in the model and denotation relation to be given together 
with the world. More speciﬁcally, Rickey’s natural model is a tuple hi, n, ∼i, where i 
is a (possibly empty) set of individuals in the world, n is a non–empty set of names in 
the world and ∼⊆ n × i. A natural interpretation of a formula φ is a natural model 
together with a valuation function v which maps name variables occurring in φ into n. 29 
Let I = hi, n, ∼i. The deﬁnition of satisfaction (relative to a valuation function) is: 
hI, vi
|= a ε b iﬀ ∃!x∈iv(a) ∼ x ∧∃x∈i(v(a) ∼ x ∧ v(b) ∼ x) 
(7.47) 
hI, vi
|= ¬φ iﬀ hI, vi 6|= φ 
(7.48) 
hI, vi
|= φ ∧ ψ iﬀ hI, vi |= φ and hI, vi |= ψ 
(7.49) 
hI, vi
|= ∀aφ(a) iﬀ hI, v0i |= φ(b) 
where b is a variable which does not occur in φ, and 
v0 extends v by mapping b into n as well. 
(7.50) 
Rickey constructed interpretations of this sort to criticize K¨ung and Canty (1970) by 
showing that substitutional interpretations can have an inﬁnite domain of individuals and 
nevertheless the domain of names does not have to be uncountable to provide suﬃcient 
“substitutional” foundation for higher–order quantiﬁcation. 
A technical remark ﬁrst. As the semantics stands, it does not avoid the diﬃculties 
raised by K¨ung and Canty. For even an extended valuation function v will map new 
variables into the plain old n with the ∼ already ﬁxed. But this means that such an 
29This is the reason why Rickey postulated that n be non–empty. He needed at least one object to 
map name variables to. 

248 
interpretation is (modulo satisﬁability) equivalent to a set–theoretic interpretation where 
only sets generated by the names present in n and by the ∼ relation are in the range 
of quantiﬁcation. That is, only extensions of those names that actually belong to n will 
matter for the satisfaction of formulas, and this is clearly a feature that K¨ung and Canty 
would ﬁnd problematic. In other words, what we get is a semantics equivalent to non– 
standard set–theoretic semantics for higher–order logic, and that means that we will not 
have certain properties that higher–order logic usually is expected to have (incomplete­
ness, categoricity etc.) 
Also, the satisfaction conditions do not seem right if ∼ is not allowed to vary. If, for 
example, in I all names are ∼-related to one and the same object, no extension of v to 
a new name variable will allow a name to refer to something else than that object.30 
Perhaps it would agree more with Rickey’s intentions to say that ∀aφ(a) is satisﬁed 
in a model I = hi, n, ∼i under a valuation v if and only if φ(a) is satisﬁed in any model 
I0 = hi, n0, ∼0i (where n0 = n ∪{y} and y is a new element of n0 and ∼0 extends ∼) under 
the valuation v0 that assigns this new element y of n0 to a. 31 
Rickey did not give any clear argument to the eﬀect that QNL ε with his semantics 
does not carry ontological commitment to sets. A plausible case for this claim, however, 
can be made. First, the quantiﬁcation itself does not bring a commitment to sets. It is 
substitutional and names are individual objects taken to exist in a world pretty much 
just like individuals. Second, the way that names contribute to the truth conditions 
of atomic sentences is non–committal either. 
Names on this view do not refer to 
objects via sets. They simply refer to objects directly. Saying that a name refers 
to objects (e.g. that ‘dog’ refers to dogs) is not the same as saying that it names a unique 
set whose members fall under this name (e.g. that ‘dog’ names a unique set whose all 
30I owe this remark to Richard Zach. 
31Another option would be to avoid extending the set of names and just vary ∼. This would yield the 
same result. I prefer to extend the set of names in order to make this semantics more similar to the one 
I develop (and when I do that, I give a reason why extending the set of names is more intuitive). 

249 
and only elements are dogs and dogs fall under the name ‘dog’ in virtue of belonging to 
this set).32 
As noted above, the semantics, as it is, is not devoid of certain technical diﬃculties. 
In what follows I develop a semantics which avoids the technical obstacles encountered 
by Rickey’s semantics, imports the modal factor suggested by Simons, and provides a 
more general ground for the future developments. 
7.4.3 Kripke semantics for QNL ε 
We have seen that to avoid the ontological commitment of higher–order quantiﬁcation 
Simons suggested that it ranges over ways of meaning. The problem is that this idea is 
quite vague and his table–method does not provide a theory that would count as a formal 
semantics. Rickey, on the other hand, suggested that name constants should be given as 
elements of the model, existing pretty much as individuals, together with a denotation 
relation. The weakness here was that the way he accounted for quantiﬁcation prima facie 
does not satisfy the requirement that the resulting system should be equivalent to the 
one with set-theoretic semantics. Also, he does not exactly indicate how to generalize 
his strategy to obtain a stronger and more expressive system. 
Simons’s account brings in a modal factor. He speaks of ways names could mean.33 
Rickey, on the other hand, suggests that quantiﬁcation over subsets of a domain can be 
avoided by introducing models with two sorts of objects and one binary relation.34 Let 
32A similar point has been made by Boolos (1998a), where the reader can look for a more emphatic 
and detailed explanation of the diﬀerence. 
33“. . . talk about ways is frequently modal in character. It need not be — we can consider the ways in 
which something actually has occurred, but in the problems of combinatorics it is fairly clear that most 
of the ways considered are never put into practice or instantiated at all – we are considering possible 
ways. This is evidenced also by the language in which such problems are posed: “In how many ways 
can . . . ?” This would also help explain why ways may outrun objects, for there could be more objects 
than there in fact are.” (Simons 1985b: 213) 
34It has been argued that any model theory for classical logic employs a modal factor. 
Melvin and Mendelsohn (1998: 11) write: “The notion of possible worlds is of a piece with standard 
model–theoretic interpretations of classical logic. . . A valid formula (i.e. a logical truth) of classical 
propositional logic is one that comes out true for every possible assignment of truth values to the state­

250 
us combine these two ideas. 
The Kripke models deﬁned below will introduce the notion of ways name could be 
formally in a fairly well–known framework. This will allows us to get a better handle on 
the semantics and perhaps provide us with a better understanding of this notion. 
Suppose we start with a world which for our purposes is devoid of linguistic objects 
(especially names). The content of this world is our domain of (already existing) bare 
individuals, call it the bare world. In this world it is possible to introduce countable 
name phrases (names, for short) which would either be empty or refer to one or more 
already existing objects. In this setting we can take a possible world to consist of two 
sorts of objects: bare individuals (those which do not name anything) and names that 
either do not name anything or name (one or more) pure individuals. The situation in 
a possible world determines what reference the names that exist in it have (if there are 
any). The bare world can be also interpreted as such a possible world, only at least one 
of the sorts would be empty. Starting with the bare world we can subsequently extend 
its repertoire of names by introducing (countably many) new names that refer to bare 
individuals. Let us idealize here: we are not putting any restrictions on which individuals 
can be named by a name, we assume that any bare individual (or any bare individuals) 
is (are) nameable. This gives raise to the so–called naming structure: 
Deﬁnition 6. A naming structure is a tuple hI, W i where I is a set (of bare indi­
viduals) and W is a set of possible worlds. A possible world is a tuple hN, δi where 
I ∩ N = ∅ and δ ⊆ N × I. The bare world is the possible world with N = ∅. The 
ment letters. This notion of alternative interpretations should not pose any more of a philosophical 
problem in modal logic than it does in classical logic. Put a slightly diﬀerent way, in so far as there 
are philosophical diﬃculties with the notion of possible world, these are diﬃculties that are already to 
be found in understanding multiple interpretations for statements of classical logic.” I tend to disagree. 
The Platonist can employ the explicit quantiﬁcation over interpretations or models of formulas of clas­
sical logic without using modal notions. Instead of saying ‘for any possible truth–value assignment’ it 
is enough to say ‘for any truth–value assignment’ if truth–value assignments are already deﬁned to be 
functions of certain speciﬁc kind.

following conditions all have to be satisﬁed: 
• B = h∅, ∅i ∈ W (i.e. the naming structure contains the bare world). 
for any w = hN, δi = B: 
– N is countable, and 
– N = ∅. 
• The accessibility relation on possible worlds is deﬁned by the following condition. Let 
w = hN, δi, w0 = hN 0, δ0i. Rww0 if and only if: 
– N ⊂ N 0, 
– {hx, yi | x ∈ N ∧hx, yi ∈ δ0} = δ. 
If M is a naming structure and I is the set of its bare individuals, we say that I 
underlies M or that M is based on I. If M = hI, W i and w ∈ W we will sometimes 
write w ∈ M. 
A few words of explanation here. First, we start “constructing” a naming structure 
with a bare world. This bare world together with I represents the situation where we 
have a set of objects that can be named but we have not introduced any names yet. Since 
in principle (unless one has very speciﬁc religious beliefs) there is no reason to believe in 
unnameable individuals, the I in the bare worlds is simply the domain of objects. 
For now, we are considering ways individuals which are not names could be named. 
This means that introducing new names does not change the domain of individuals (that 
is why I is a set in the naming structure and does not vary with possible worlds). Also, 
this indicates that the only way we get from one possible world to another accessible 
world is by extending the repertoire of available names (so N has to be a proper subset 
of N 0). 

252 
On the nominalist reading, quite plausibly, names are ﬁnite sequences of symbols (or 
phonemes) from a ﬁnite alphabet. This means that in any possible world there can be 
at most countably many names (hence the requirement that N be countable). Moreover, 
the basic idea is that by “going” to another possible world we are extending what we 
already have; not changing the ways that names that we already have are. That is, we 
can add a new name and take it to refer to such–and–such objects, but the reference of 
the already existing names cannot be changed. In a sense, names are thought of as given 
with reference. Hence the denotation relation in an accessible world has to agree with 
the initial denotation relation on all names that already existed before we extended the 
set of names. 
This sort of structure will not ensure yet that every intuitively possible way of meaning 
will have a representation in a model. To do this, we have to require that for any subset 
of the domain of individuals in a possible world there be an accessible possible world in 
which there is a name which denotes all and only its elements. 
Deﬁnition 7. Let hN, δi = w ∈ W . A naming structure M = hI, W i is w–complete if 
and only if: 
∀A⊆N ∃w0=hN0,δ0i(Rww0 ∧∃x∈N0 ∀y∈I (δ0(x, y) ≡ y ∈ A)) 
A naming structure M = hI, W i is complete iﬀ for any w ∈ W M is w–complete.  
The basic idea is that a naming structure is w–complete iﬀ for any set of individuals 
existing in this world, there is a world accessible from w where a name which names 
elements of this set exists. In other words, it is w–complete if it models the full range of 
ways names could be in w. 
Here is an example of a B-complete naming structure which is not complete. The 
bullets above the lines represent objects in I, sequences of numerals represent elements of

N and R represents the accessibility relation (I do not mark transitivity). The denotation 
relation is encoded in the shape of sequences of numerals representing elements of N. 
0 represents a name which does not name anything. A bracketed sequence of numerals 
(n1 · · · ni) (1 ≤ nk ≤ 3, i < 4) represents a name which names all the n1–th, · · · , and 
ni–th objects above the line, counting from left.

where I (for the sake of simplicity) assume that if two names occur on one branch of the 
tree and denote the same they are the same name. 
The reason why B–completeness is not suﬃcient is that the class of B–complete 
naming structures would agree with classical set–theoretic semantics only on sentences 
with only one quantiﬁer. In a naming structure, the iteration of quantiﬁers carries us 
deeper and deeper into the structure (this will become clearer when I introduce the modal 
semantics based on naming structures). 
I can now explain how quantiﬁcation in QNL ε is supposed to range over ways names 
could be (or refer). I will be evaluating sentences in a naming structure by evaluating 
them in its bare world. First, we have to deﬁne satisfaction of a formula at a world in a 
naming structure. 

 
254 
Deﬁnition 8. An M–interpretation is a triple hM, w, vi, where M is a naming struc­
ture, w = hN, δi is a possible world in M and v either assigns to every variable in 
QNL ε an element of N, if N =6
∅, or is the empty function on the set of variables 
of QNL ε otherwise. If M is a complete naming structure, then we say that this M– 
interpretation is complete.  
Satisfaction of formulas under M–interpretations is deﬁned as follows. 
Deﬁnition 9. Let hM, w, vi be an M–interpretation, w = hN, δi. Also, let a and b be 
QNL ε –variables and φ and ψ be QNL ε –formulas. 
• hM, w, vi
|= a ε b iﬀ v(a) and v(b) are deﬁned and ∃!x∈I hv(a), xi
∈ δ and 
∃y∈I (hv(a), yi ∈ δ ∧hv(b), yi ∈ δ). 
• hM, w, vi |= φ ∧ ψ iﬀ hM, w, vi |= φ and hM, w, vi |= ψ. 
• hM, w, vi |= ¬φ iﬀ v is not the empty function and hM, w, vi 6|= φ. 
• hM, w, vi |= ∃aφ iﬀ for some w0 ∈ M, Rww0 and hM, w0, v0i |= φ where v0 diﬀers from v 
at most in what it assigns to a. 
The basic idea is that we treat the class of names that exist in a certain world as 
the class of substituents when we evaluate a formula in this world. Since the bare world 
does not contain names the notion of satisfaction in the bare world as applied to open 
formulas is not very fascinating. No formula containing free variables will be satisﬁed at 
the bare world. The situation changes when it comes to evaluating sentences in bare 
worlds. First, let us say that a sentence is true in a naming structure M if and 
only if it is satisﬁed in its bare world under any valuation. A sentence is M–valid if 
and only if it is true in any naming structure. A sentence is M–complete valid if it is 
true in any complete naming structure. 

255 
Theorem 12. For any QNL ε sentence φ, φ is S–valid if and only if φ is M–complete 
valid. 
Proof. Since we are talking about truth of sentences at the bare world, and this depends 
on the satisfaction of formulas at non-bare worlds, it will be enough to show that (i) for 
any naming structure, any non-bare world in it and any valuation, there is an S-model 
that agrees with this possible world under that valuation on any QNL ε-formula, and (ii) 
for any formula that fails at an S-model w there is a naming structure with a certain 
non-bare world and a valuation, so that φ fails at that world in this naming structure 
under that valuation. 
ad (i). I will just show, given a non-bare world in a naming structure and a valuation 
function, how to construct a corresponding S-model that satisﬁes exactly those formulas 
that are satisﬁed at that world under that valuation. Take a w = hN, δi in a naming 
structure based on I. Let v map name variables a1, a2, . . . into N. To obtain an equivalent 
S-model w0 = hD, Ini take D = I and let for any ai: 
In(ai) = {x ∈ I | δ(v(ai), x)} 
The proof that two such models satisfy the same formulas is by induction. The ba­
sic case and Boolean steps are fairly trivial. 
For the quantiﬁed formulas, suppose 
hM, w, vi |= ∃aφ. Then there is a world w1 = hN1, δ1i accessible from w and a valuation 
v0 (into N1) which diﬀers from v at most in what it assigns to a such that hM, w1, v0i |= φ. 
Take an S-model w1
0 = hD, In1i generated from w1 by taking D = I and 
In1(ai) = {x ∈ I | δ(v0(ai), x)} 
for any i. Clearly w1
0 (by the induction hypothesis) models φ. Also, w1
0 diﬀers from w0 at 
most in what it assigns to ai and therefore w0 models ∃aφ. Suppose on the other hand 
that it is the S-model thus generated (w0) that satisﬁes ∃aφ. Then, there is an S-model 

256 
w2
0 = hD, In2i such that In2 diﬀers from In at most at a and w2
0 |= φ. Since our naming 
structure is complete, there has to be a possible world w3 = hN3, δ3i accessible from w 
and a valuation v3 corresponding to w2
0 , i.e. such that for any i: 
∀x∈I [δ3(v3(ai), x) ≡ x ∈ In0
2] 
But v3 will diﬀer from v at most at a, so also w |= ∃aφ. 
ad (ii). Suppose a formula φ fails at an S-model M = hD, Ini, let a1, . . . ak be all 
variables that occur in φ. Take a naming structure w with I = D. Since the structure is 
complete, there exist a possible world w = hN, δi such that for any A ⊆ D, if for some i, 
In(ai) = A then there is a y ∈ N such that for all x ∈ I, δ(y, x) ≡ x ∈ A. If In(ai) = A 
let v(ai) be an arbitrary y ∈ N for which this condition ( ∀x∈I (δ(y, x) ≡ x ∈ A) holds. 
Then also φ fails at this possible world under v. The proof (that M and w agree on φ) 
goes by induction. Again, the basic case and Boolean steps are quite obvious. For the 
quantiﬁed formulas (say, ∃aψ) notice that if there is an S-model M 0 that diﬀers from M 
on at most one variable then (via the completeness of naming structure) there has to be 
a possible world w0 accessible from w and a valuation function v0 which diﬀers at most 
on this variable, such that w0 agrees with M 0 on ψ under v0. 
Interestingly, various versions of weaker logics are obtainable when we put additional 
restrictions on the accessibility relation. For instance we can require that names name 
only a ﬁnite number of objects, or that the only way a new name can be introduced is by 
means of a deﬁnition; we can be interested in another notion of validity, which depends 
on the class of all naming models, not necessarily complete, and obtain weaker logics 
for which completeness results are available, pretty much just like it happens with for 
instance Henkin semantics etc. Those subsystems lie beyond the scope of the present 
considerations.

7.4.4 Modal logic of naming 
I gave a modal semantics for QNL ε and I have shown how it preserves classical, set-
theoretic theoremhood. To clarify the issue of ontological commitment of this semantics 
I now develop a ﬁrst-order modal logic of naming which (in a sense to be speciﬁed) 
mimics the behavior of plural quantiﬁers. The natural language reading of the many-
sorted modal formulas I take to express the meaning I intend to assign to QNL ε formulas. 
I will return to the issue of ontological commitment once all technicalities are in place. 
The language of the modal logic of naming (MLN) contains two sorts of variables: 
individual variables 
x, y, z, x1, x2, . . . , y1, y2, . . . , z1, z2, . . . 
and name variables 
n, m, o, n1, n2, . . . , m1, m2, . . . , o1, o2, . . . 
Besides it contains quantiﬁers ranging over objects of those two sorts (∀, ∃), classical 
propositional connectives, two modal operators (, ♦), no predicate variables, identity 
symbol (=) and one two–place predicate constant (Δ). Formation rules are standard 
(the only new thing is that Δ takes name variables as ﬁrst arguments and individual 
variables as second arguments). 
Models of MLN are just naming structures. 
Deﬁnition 10. An MLN–interpretation is a tuple hM, w, ii where M = hI, W i is 
a naming structure, hN, δi = w ∈ M and i is (a) undeﬁned if N = ∅ and (b) maps 
all individual variables into I and all name variables into N otherwise. Satisfaction of 
MLN–formulas in interpretations is deﬁned as follows: 
hM, w, ii = Δ(n, x) iﬀ i is deﬁned (i.e. N = ∅, see (a) above) and hi(n), i(x)i ∈ δ. 
• hM, w, ii |= t1 = t2 iﬀ i(t1) = i(t2), where each ti is a variable of one of the sorts. 

258 
• hM, w, ii |= ¬φ iﬀ hM, w, ii 6|= φ. 
• hM, w, ii |= φ ∧ ψ iﬀ hM, w, ii |= φ and hM, w, ii |= ψ. 
• hM, w, ii |= ∃αφ iﬀ there is an interpretation i0 (mapping individual variables into I and 
name variables into N) that diﬀers from i only in what it assigns to α and hM, w, i0i |= φ. 
An MLN–sentence is true in a naming structure if it is satisﬁed in its underlying 
bare world.  
Intuitively we read ‘♦φ’ as ‘there is a way names could be such that φ’ and ‘Δ(n, x)’ 
as ‘x is one of the objects denoted by n’ or ‘n refers to x’ (where it is not assumed that 
names have to refer uniquely). 
There is a translation from QNL ε into MLN. We may safely assume that all variables 
of QNL ε are of the form ai. Each variable ai is translated as ni. The translation function 
f is deﬁned as follows: 
f(ai ε aj )
=
(∃x(Δ(ni, x) ∧∀y(Δ(ni, y) 
y = x)) ∧
→ 
∧∃x(Δ(ni, x) ∧ Δ(nj , x))) 
(7.51) 
f( φ)
= 
f(φ) 
(7.52)
¬
¬
f(φ ∧ ψ)
= f(φ) ∧ f(ψ) 
(7.53) 
f(∃ai φ)
= ♦∃ni f(φ) 
(7.54) 
It follows from the deﬁnitions of satisfaction and truth for both systems that: 
Theorem 13. For any QNL ε–sentence φ and any naming structure M, M |= QNL ε φ 
(φ is true in M) if and only if M |= MLN f(φ). 
Proof. This relies on the fact that if we just take i(nk) = v(ak) in all worlds but the bare 
world the models behave pretty much in the same way. For take any naming structure 
M = hI, W i and a non-bare world w = hN, δi (we are not concerned with the bare 

259 
world because we are evaluating sentences) take i(nk) = v(ak) for any k. Then, for any 
QNL ε-formula φ, hM, w, vi |= φ if and only if hM, w, ii |= f(φ). 
Consider the basic case. The formula ai ε aj is satisﬁed at w under v if and only if v 
assigns to ai a name which is δ-related to exactly one object and this object is among 
objects to which the name v-assigned to aj is δ-related. But this is the same condition 
(mutatis mutandis, because we speak of function i and not v) which is stated by t(ai ε aj ). 
The steps pertaining to Boolean connectives are simple. Let us turn to the quantiﬁer. 
∃aφ is satisﬁed at w under v iﬀ there is an R-accessible world (from w), w0 such that φ 
is satisﬁed at it under a valuation that diﬀers from v at most at a. But this is essentially 
the same condition as the satisfaction condition on ♦∃ni t(φ). 
7.4.5 Remarks 
Ways names could be and Chihara’s constructibility quantiﬁers. One way to go 
now, if one wants to provide a nominalist story about quantiﬁcation in QNL ε, is to say 
that MLN provides us with a correct rendering of sentences of QNL ε and to claim that 
the possible–worlds semantics employed is just a useful myth which allows one to make the 
relation between the above mentioned modalities and quantiﬁers in QNL ε clear. Prima 
facie, this seems to be the strategy employed by Chihara (1990), whose constructibility 
quantiﬁers play pretty much the same role in his system as QNL ε quantiﬁers in their 
modal interpretation.35 I agree with him that the notion of constructibility (or logical 
admissibility) is primitive, and I agree with his remarks about the existence of possible 
tokens (esp. with the remarks on pp. 40–54) and the role of possible worlds (I am far 
from being a modal realist).36 The language of MLN I take to be quite intuitive and the 
35He writes: “Remember, that for me, this whole possible world structure is an elaborate myth, useful 
for clarifying and explaining modal notions, but a myth just the same. It would be a mistake to take 
this myth too seriously and imagine that we are exploring real worlds, ﬁnding there real open–sentence 
tokens that have puzzling features.” (p. 60) However, he does have much more to say about possible 
worlds and modalities (see Chihara 1998).

MLN–renderings of the usual axioms of QNL ε I take to be intuitively obvious (However, 
I have to put aside any philosophical discussion concerning the qualms about acceptability 
of modalities from the nominalist point of view). The main diﬀerences are: (i) When we 
extend the language to higher–order names (a strategy that lies beyond the scope of the 
present work) the result will not resemble type theory, but rather a cumulative hierarchy, 
and (ii) instead of introducing constructibility quantiﬁers explicitly I model ways names 
could be using standard modalities and reshaping the accessibility relation. 
Are there enough substitutents? We can recall that one of the objections against 
the substitutional interpretation of QNL ε was that if the domain is inﬁnite we will always 
run out of substituents for under no circumstances the existence of uncountable inﬁnity 
of names is possible. Naming structures by deﬁnition can only contain possible worlds 
with a countable number of names. It does not follow, however, that we will run out 
of possible names if the bare world is inﬁnite. In any complete naming structure any 
subset of the domain will have a possible name corresponding to it. Of course, it is not 
the case that there is a possible world which contains all such names simultaneously, but 
that is not a problem for the modal interpretation of higher–order quantiﬁcation. The 
initial plausibility of the objection results from the ambiguity between: 
(7.55) 
It is possible that for every subset of the domain there is a name 
which names all and only those objects which are elements of this subset. 
and 
(7.56) 
For any subset of the domain it is possible that there is a name which 
names all and only all its elements. 
Let us grant that the set of names in a possible world has to be countable; at least on the 
nominalist view names are ﬁnite inscriptions or utterances over a ﬁnite alphabet. The 
diﬀerence between the readings given above is pretty much like the diﬀerence between 

261 
the statement that it is possible that every real number has a name (which would require 
the existence of uncountably many names) and the claim that for any real number it 
is possible for it to have a name. The ﬁrst is false, the second true. Size limitation 
objections may work well against (7.55). Alas, it is not (7.55) but rather (7.56) that is 
posited in the modal interpretation under discussion, and it is not prone to this sort of 
diﬃculties. 
Why complete naming structures? When we try to provide a nominalist story 
about a logic equivalent to QNL ε with S–semantics, what reasons do we have to postulate 
that it is only complete naming structures that matter? In a sense, why do we concern 
ourselves with such a strong notion, one might say? If the claim is that this is what 
nameability really is like, one might launch an attack along the following lines. 
Certain objects are nameable if and only if there is a person who could name 
them. But it is far from obvious that for any objects there is a person who 
can name them. For suppose a person utters (or writes) a token and wants to 
establish its reference. It seems that she either has to be able to formulate in 
her language a description which only those objects satisfy and which employs 
only those expressions whose reference she may take for granted, or she has 
to have direct epistemic access to those objects (well, at least pretty much as 
direct as the act of pointing at an object, as opposed to determining reference 
through a description). But it is not obvious that her language is suﬃciently 
expressive to provide her with a description that determines this set, and it 
is quite obvious that her relation to quite a few objects in the world will be 
far from direct epistemic access. Hence, it seems, we should not attach that 
sort of signiﬁcance to complete naming structures. 
Here is a rejoinder to this sort of criticism. The required notion of nameability does 
not require the existence of persons who can actually name those objects, nor does it 

262 
obviously require that there be an ideal agent who would be able to name certain objects, 
had he existed in this possible world. We can consider objects belonging to a certain set 
nameable if we know that by introducing a name that denotes all and only its elements 
we would not run into troubles of logical nature, and that is all there is to it. A theory of 
nameability thus understood is not a chapter in mathematical theology (if I may borrow 
an expression from (Boolos et al. 2002: 19)) concerned with ideal naming agents and so 
on, but rather a theory which tries to describe certain conditions under which a name 
that denotes certain objects can be introduced without worrying about consistency. Vivid 
metaphors which employ an ideal naming agent may be helpful, but the possible behavior 
of ideal agents is not what the theory is about, strictly speaking. 
An analogy might help. Suppose someone argues: 
Certain functions are computable if and only if there is a person who could 
compute them. But it is far from obvious that for any (say) Turing com­
putable function there is a person who can compute its value for any input. 
Quite obviously, there are certain computable functions and certain inputs 
such that no person alive would be able to compute the values of those func­
tion for those inputs. Therefore we should not attach such signiﬁcance to the 
class of all Turing–computable functions. 
Arguments of this sort do not disprove the usefulness of the notion of Turing–computability. 
At best, they just show that people’s actions are not exactly what Turing computability 
theory is about. Also, even though the notion of computability used here is indeed quite 
strong and therefore it may aid the imagination to think of it as a theory of an ideal com­
puter (in the good old sense of the word, when ‘computer’ meant the same as ‘reckoner’ 
or ‘ﬁgurer’), ideal computing agents are not exactly the subjects of the discipline. 
On the other hand, qualms about the practical intractability of certain Turing com­
putable functions are legitimate and certain other theories bearing upon more manage­

263 
able functions are called for. Likewise, doubts concerning the divergences between the 
practical nameability and the logical nameability can suggest other, diﬀerent, more 
practically interested theories. 
Let me draw another parallel here. Of high importance in Turing computability 
theory are limitation theorems: the knowledge that even if we put pretty much no 
practical restrictions on computability there still are functions which cannot be computed 
is quite substantial. The purpose of the nameability theory is to provide an (in a sense) 
substitutional semantics for QNL ε . Note that when we think of a logic substitutionally 
one of our main concerns is to be able to apply it to any names whatsoever without any 
uncertainty as to whether the validity or truth will be preserved when we eliminate the 
universal quantiﬁer and substitute a name for the variable that it binds. Here, widening 
the range of possible names strengthens our case (in a sense, it makes our logic more 
universal). Of course, it would be enough if we could somehow delimit the class of 
possible names that practically speaking could be introduced and treat those possible 
names as admissible substituents. This would not change the applicability of our logic. 
A dissimilarity between computability and nameability emerges here. We now have 
computers (that is, machines) whose computational capabilities are quite deﬁned and it 
makes practical sense to introduce more practically motivated precise notions of com­
putability (for instance, because problems which are not solvable in polynomial time are 
quite intractable by means nowadays available it made sense to introduce the notion 
of NP complexity). In the case of naming there is no ﬁne line to draw between what 
practically speaking can be named and what cannot (i.e. there does not seem to exist 
a notion that would mirror the relevant sense of ‘intractability‘ in our analogy). For in­
stance, it does not seem proper to postulate that names can denote only a ﬁnite number 
of objects or that the only way new names can be formed is by deﬁnitions employing 
expressions whose reference is already known. For this reason it seems it is better, at 

264 
least for now, to stick with the idealized notion of nameability which does not put any 
practical limitations on naming capability.37 
Against this universality claim one can try to argue that by considering complete 
naming structures only we do not strengthen our logic, but rather do quite the opposite. 
When instead of considering all naming structures we restrict ourselves to complete 
structures only, the argument may go, “we weaken our logic: we lose completeness!” 
Confusing as such a statement may be, it is certainly interesting. Let us take a look 
at what is going on here. The problem will emerge when the system will be extended 
to obtain a system of power comparable to that of full higher–order logic. The set of 
formulas of thus extended language valid with respect to the class of complete naming 
structures (this notion will be also modiﬁed to account for the generality required by the 
system) will not be eﬀectively axiomatizable, whereas had we restricted our attention 
to naming structures without putting this additional requirement, we would be able to 
obtain an eﬀective axiomatization of the system. Now, since eﬀective axiomatizability 
is a “nice feature”, the argument suggests, we should not introduce a semantics which 
would force us to abandon it. 
This sort of objection results from an ambiguity of the word ‘logic’. If we have in 
mind some sort of axiomatization of a theory and by ‘logic’ we mean an axiomatic system, 
then the change of semantics does not change the logic at all (if we do not change our 
inference rules, axioms etc.), although our axiomatic system with respect to the stronger 
semantics (which considers only complete structures) does not have certain (perhaps) 
desirable properties that it had with respect to the weaker semantics. If by ‘logic’ we 
mean the consequence operation (or the validity) determined by a language together with 
37For instance, in a similar spirit Venema (1998: 1196) criticizing Manzano (1996) who focuses on 
Henkin–style semantics for higher–order logic (that is, the type of semantics which does not presume 
that all subsets of the domain are in the range of second–order quantiﬁers) complains that she did not 
give any examples “of how non–standard semantics forms a good modeling for phenomena in the outside 
world”. 

265 
its semantics (as we do in our considerations) then by limiting our attention to complete 
structures we do not weaken the logic. To the contrary, we strengthen it to the level that 
no axiomatic system can match. 
Set-theoretic content of plural logic. On the face of it, if the nominalist can pro­
vide us with a nominalistically acceptable philosophical motivation to treat the modal­
ities involved in the modal translations of sentences of QNL ε as ontologically non– 
committing, the story about modal interpretation of QNL ε given above suggests how 
he can use QNL ε without being committed to abstract objects. 
There is, however, yet another style of arguments against the belief that the logic of 
plurals is ontologically neutral. I mentioned it brieﬂy on page 227. The objection can be 
extracted from an argument against the logicality thesis (“the logic of plurals qualify as 
pure logic”). It is not my present concern to deﬁne (or discover) what being a pure logic 
consists in; let me just say that the main feature of plural logic that struck some people 
as problematic is its apparently set–theoretic content. The claim that LP (or QNL ε, for 
that matter) has a set–theoretic content, together with the initially plausible assumption 
that whatever has set–theoretic content is committed to sets lead to the conclusion that 
LP is committed to sets. 
Here is a good example of a discussion pertaining to the logicality of the logic of 
plurals:38 
First [in the logic of plurals] there are the tautologies and the inference rules 
governing identity and the singular quantiﬁers. There is broad consensus 
that these qualify as logical. Next there are the inference rules governing the 
plural quantiﬁers. Since these rules are completely analogous to the rules 
governing the singular quantiﬁers it would be hard to deny that they too 
38Linnebo has also another argument against the ontological innocence of the logic of plurals (2003). 
Since it rather pertains to higher–order extensions of the logic of plurals, I will get back to this sort of 
objections once I provide a modal account of those more complicated systems. 

266 
qualify as logical. Then there are the extensionality axioms and the axiom 
that all pluralities are non–empty. These axioms are unproblematic because 
they can plausibly be taken to be analytic. What remains are the plural 
comprehension axioms, where things are much less clear. For these axioms 
have no obvious singular counterparts, and their syntactical form indicates 
that they make existential claims.39 (Linnebo 2004) 
Mutatis mutandis, this objection can be mounted against the ontological innocence of 
QNL ε: one might say, it not only makes existential claims (comprehension axioms of the 
form ∃a∀b(b ε a ≡ b ε a ∧ φ(b)) come out true in any complete naming structure), but also 
clearly has non–logical content because the comprehension axioms have no corresponding 
ﬁrst–order (or singular) counterparts. Both qualms deserve consideration. Let us start 
with the ﬁrst one. 
If we believe that nameability is quite well–understood without postulating abstract 
objects and we accept the modal reading of QNL ε quantiﬁers, there is no reason to read 
any serious existential import into comprehension axioms. They just mirror the fact 
that for any formula φ of QNL ε at any possible world w there is no logical obstacle to 
introducing a new name that would refer to those individuals in w which satisfy φ, or 
that names that coincide in reference with one–place open formulas of QNL ε are logically 
admissible.40 
How about singular counterparts of comprehension axioms? It is not wholly clear 
what the objection is supposed to attain if it is meant to show that LP is committed to 
sets. I guess the intuition behind it is this. If something is a fairly obvious generalization 
of what is already present in the standard ﬁrst–order logic, its nature is logical. Thus, for 
39Linnebo does not exactly say that it is his view; nor does he say it is not his view. I just use his 
wording for its brevity and clarity. 
40Say we take φ(a) to refer to those objects whose singular names (had there been any) substituted 
for a in φ(a) (which does not contain other free variables) would yield true sentences. 

267 
instance (at least when it comes to the rules of inference in any standard axiomatization) 
the rules pertaining to behavior of quantiﬁers in QNL ε are on par with the rules per­
taining to quantiﬁers in ﬁrst–order logic. The same goes for rules pertaining to Boolean 
connectives. Comprehension axioms, on the other hand, one might say, are something 
new: there is nothing in ﬁrst order logic which suggests anything like comprehension 
axioms in QNL ε . 
On the modal reading of QNL ε , the comprehension schema may be taken to say 
something about the power of the language within a naming structure. The fact that 
it holds in a naming structure would indicate that the expressive power of forming new 
deﬁnitions in QNL ε does not supersede the nameability: that at least one legitimate way 
of introducing new names is by postulating that they refer to those (already existing) 
objects which satisfy certain condition expressible in the language of QNL ε . What 
meaning would a singular comprehension schema have on the modal reading? Well, 
a plausible interpretation is that it would say something like: for any formula which 
determines exactly one object it is possible to introduce an individual constant which 
names the unique individual that satisﬁes the formula. This, however, cannot be stated 
in the standard ﬁrst–order language because its quantiﬁers are understood literally and it 
has no means of referring to possible names. This should indicate that the comprehension 
axioms are not responsible for extending the ontological commitment of a theory; rather, 
the reason why it is hard to formulate their ﬁrst–order versions and why it is easy to 
formulate QNL ε versions of comprehension axioms is that names in QNL ε can name 
pretty much any objects without restriction, whereas in a ﬁrst–order language we have 
individual variables but no variables ranging over possible individual constants. 
Is the reference relation innocent? Granted that quantiﬁcation over sets has been 
eliminated in virtue of the modal–substitutional interpretation of plural quantiﬁcation, 
one can still raise doubts regarding the innocence of the reference relation that possible 

268 
names bear to objects in the world. On could argue along the following lines:41 
Ok, so we made names the values of variables. How does it help if, it seems, 
the names themselves can still refer to sets via the δ relation? Why isn’t this 
just syntactic sugar? 
To understand the misreading that stands behind this sort of objection let us ﬁrst note 
that there are three, not two, readings involved. One, the straightforwardly set–theoretic 
one reads ‘∃a’ as: 
(7.57) There is a set a such that. . . 
The second one, which is the reading implicit in the above objection interprets ‘∃a’ as: 
(7.58) It is possible to introduce a name which refers to a certain set such 
that. . . 
Of course, this second reading of quantiﬁers, even though, in a sense, substitutional, 
does not eliminate ontological commitment to sets. The natural language reading that 
the modal semantics I developed suggests is none of the above. Rather, it interprets the 
phrase in question as: 
(7.59) It is possible to introduce a name (which may not refer at all, refer 
to a unique object or refer to multiple objects), such that . . . 
The last reading does not interpret possible names as referring to sets. Rather, it assumes 
that the fact that a name (a countable noun phrase) refers to multiple objects or does 
not refer to anything at all is of the same ontologically innocent status as the fact that 
a name refers to a unique object. 
Even the most severe opponents of the ontological innocence of the logic of plurals 
allow that reference of singular terms does not bring in any commitment to sets. So, it 
41Richard Zach turned my attention to this sort of doubt. 

269 
seems, the reference relation alone is not a problem for a nominalist. Now, why should 
this change when he admits that a name can fail to refer to anything? Well, it should 
not. To say that ‘Spiderman’ does not refer to anything is not to say that ‘Spiderman’ 
refers to the empty set. It is only a very prejudiced commitment to the ‘Fido’-Fido 
principle that may convince one that for any expression there has to exist its unique 
referent which explains how the expression contributes to the truth–value of sentences in 
which it occurs. Having said this, let us ask: Why should the situation be diﬀerent when 
we turn to names that refer to more than one object? 
It seems that competent language users which did not have any experience with 
philosophy should have a say in this debate; and I presume that very few of them would 
suggest that ‘Dogs are animals’ is true in virtue of there being certain objects which 
do not exist in space and time42 such that each dog remains in a certain relation of 
“belonging” to one of them and each animal remains in this relation to another and those 
two untouchable objects remain in a certain unobservable relation. To the contrary, the 
fact that underlies the truth of this sentence is quite observable and pertains to certain 
real individual objects: dogs and animals. It requires a certain amount of philosophical 
sophistry to deny that ‘dogs’ refers to dogs or that ‘animals’ refer to animals along the 
lines suggested above. 
When we try to explain nominalistically the logic of plurals, there are two aspects 
that have to be dealt with. First, we should say what plural quantiﬁers quantify over 
(or how they should be interpreted). My reading is: they are modal devices which are 
explained substitutionally in terms of possible countable noun phrases. Second, the very 
use of plurals, even without quantiﬁers should be explained as nominalistically acceptable. 
My explanation is: unless someone assumes that every expression should have a unique 
42For the sake of simplicity I ignore the position that sets exist in space and time in addition to usual 
objects as quite unbelievable. This position was held for a while by Maddy (1980). A plausible criticism 
of it is to be found in (Chihara 1990: 194–215). 

270 
referent and believes in set theory already there is no linguistic evidence to the eﬀect that 
the existence of sets is required to make sense of the reference of plurals. Interpreting 
plurals as referring to sets has certain theoretic advantages when we do formal semantics 
(set–theory is fairly well–known and the semantics is slightly simpler), but this does not 
constitute any argument to the eﬀect that this is the only way to make sense of plural 
constructions. A more parsimonious answer is: plurals refer to objects directly. ‘Dogs’ 
refers to dogs, ‘chairs’ refers to chairs and it is enough to believe in the existence of chairs 
and dogs (as opposed to believing in the existence of sets as well) in order to understand 
sentences in which ‘dogs’ or ‘chairs’ occur. 
The expression ‘refers to’ in the relevant sense has pretty much the same meaning 
as ‘is truly predicable of’. When we introduce a name for already existing objects, it 
refers to those already existing objects of which it is truly predicable. ‘Rafal Urbaniak’ 
refers to me because ‘This is Rafal Urbaniak’ is true when the utterer points at me. 
There is nothing that forces us to say that being–truly–predicable–of in the case of 
‘Rafal Urbaniak’ requires that there be a singleton set containing me as its sole element. 
What is more, clearly if being–truly–predicable–of something is a necessary condition for 
referring to this thing (and this is how I prefer to understand the reference relation), 
‘Rafal Urbaniak’ does not refer to any set (even though being an eternal being might be 
an upside of being a set, I tend to think of myself as an object which is not out of space 
and time). Similarly, if we have an empty name, like ‘Superman’, there is no object of 
which we can truly say that it is Superman (‘Superman’ is not truly predicable of the 
empty set). It is false that in this sense ‘Superman’ refers to the empty set because it 
is false that the empty set is Superman. How about names that intuitively name more 
than one object? The expression ‘chair(s)’ is truly predicable of each and every chair 
and therefore every chair is a referent of the word ‘chair’.43 Also, the set of chairs (if 
43Thus, on the view under discussion, the reference of distributive plurals is nothing above and beyond 

271 
there is such an object) is not a referent of the word ‘chair(s)’, for it is not a chair itself. 
Hence, in this sense of the phrase, reference of names is a relation between tokens and 
individuals themselves which does not proceed via sets and which does not require the 
existence of sets. 
7.4.6 Summary of the chapter 
I ﬁrst constructed a language of the quantiﬁed name logic. Then, I provided it with a set– 
theoretic semantics. For the sake of comparison, I have shown that (modulo set–theoretic 
semantics) we can take it to be a variant of the logic of plurals. Next, I discussed an 
alleged argument to the eﬀect that the logic of plurals bears with it a commitment to 
sets. The argument relies on the assumption that the substitutional interpretation of the 
quantiﬁers does not result in semantics which can satisfy the same theoretical postulates 
which the set–theoretic semantics fulﬁlls. 
I turned to a more detailed analysis of the argument against the substitutional inter­
pretation of plural quantiﬁers. It turns out that in the literature of the subjects there 
have been at least two attempts to construct an interpretation of plural quantiﬁers which 
does not commit one to sets and does not weaken the expressive power of the language in 
question. On of them is not really substitutional: it is based on the idea that quantiﬁers 
range over ‘ways names could mean’. The diﬃculty is that it is not well–worked out and 
the notion of a ‘way name could mean’ is taken to be primitive. Another, in a sense, is 
substitutional, but the problem is it actually changes the logic. 
So I developed a modal semantics which uses possible worlds to clarify the notion of 
a ‘way name could be’ and employs some intuitions behind the substitutional reading 
of quantiﬁers used in the second of the attempts mentioned above. Given that the 
accessibility relation is shaped according to certain obvious intuitions, sentences of the 
the reference to particulars. This means that we also do not need anything like “mereological fusion of 
all chairs” as the referent of ‘chair(s)’ (at least as far as plural quantiﬁcation is concerned). 

272 
quantiﬁed name logic have a reasonable translation into a more familiar language — the 
two–sorted language of ﬁrst–order modal logic. 
This indicates that the ontological commitment of quantiﬁed name logic (on the modal 
reading) does not go beyond the commitment of ﬁrst–order modal logic. The quantiﬁers 
of quantiﬁed name logic range over possible name tokens and the reference relation is 
a relation that bears name tokens directly to extra–linguistic individuals without the 
mediacy of sets.
