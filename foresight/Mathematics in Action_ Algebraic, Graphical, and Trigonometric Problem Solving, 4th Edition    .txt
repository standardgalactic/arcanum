Preface
Our Vision
Mathematics in Action: Algebraic, Graphical, and Trigonometric Problem Solving, Fourth
Edition, is intended to help college mathematics students gain mathematical literacy in the
real world and simultaneously help them build a solid foundation for future study in mathe-
matics and other disciplines.
Our team of fourteen faculty, primarily from the State University of New York and the City
University of New York systems, used the AMATYC Crossroads standards to develop this three-
book series to serve a very large population of college students at the pre-precalculus level. Many
of our students have had previous exposure to mathematics at this level. It became apparent to us
that teaching the same content in the same way to students who have not previously compre-
hended it is not effective, and this realization motivated us to develop a new approach.
Mathematics in Action is based on the principle that students learn mathematics best by
doing mathematics within a meaningful context. In keeping with this premise, students
solve problems in a series of realistic situations from which the crucial need for mathemat-
ics arises. Mathematics in Action guides students toward developing a sense of indepen-
dence and taking responsibility for their own learning. Students are encouraged to construct,
reflect on, apply, and describe their own mathematical models, which they use to solve
meaningful problems. We see this as the key to bridging the gap between abstraction and
application and as the basis for transfer learning. Appropriate technology is integrated
throughout the books, allowing students to interpret real-life data verbally, numerically,
symbolically, and graphically.
We expect that by using the Mathematics in Action series, all students will be able to achieve
the following goals:
•
Develop mathematical intuition and a relevant base of mathematical knowledge.
•
Gain experiences that connect classroom learning with real-world applications.
•
Prepare effectively for further college work in mathematics and related disciplines.
•
Learn to work in groups as well as independently.
•
Increase knowledge of mathematics through explorations with appropriate technology.
•
Develop a positive attitude about learning and using mathematics.
•

Pedagogical Features
The pedagogical core of Mathematics in Action is a series of guided-discovery activities in
which students work in groups to discover mathematical principles embedded in realistic sit-
uations. The key principles of each activity are highlighted and summarized at the activity’s
conclusion. Each activity is followed by exercises that reinforce the concepts and skills
revealed in the activity.
The activities are clustered within each chapter. Each cluster contains regular activities along
with project activities that relate to particular topics. The lab activities require more than just
paper, pencil, and calculator; they also require measurements and data collection and are
ideal for in-class group work. The project activities are designed to allow students to explore
specific topics in greater depth, either individually or in groups. These activities are usually
self-contained and have no accompanying exercises. For specific suggestions on how to use
the three types of activities, we strongly encourage instructors to refer to the Instructor’s
Resource Manual with Tests that accompanies this text.
Each cluster concludes with two sections: What Have I Learned? and How Can I Practice? The
What Have I Learned? exercises are designed to help students pull together the key concepts of
the cluster. The How Can I Practice? exercises are designed primarily to provide additional
work with the numeric and algebraic skills of the cluster. Taken as a whole, these exercises give
students the tools they need to bridge the gaps between abstraction, skills, and application.
Additionally, each chapter ends with a Summary that contains a brief description of the con-
cepts and skills discussed in the chapter, plus examples illustrating these concepts and skills.
The concepts and skills are also cross-referenced to the activity in which they appear, making
the format easier to follow for those students who are unfamiliar with our approach. Each chap-
ter also ends with a Gateway Review, providing students with an opportunity to check their
understanding of the chapter’s concepts and skills.
Changes from the Third Edition
The fourth edition retains all the features of the previous edition, with the following content
changes:
•
All data-based activities and exercises have been updated to reflect the most recent
information and/or replaced with more relevant topics.
•
The language in many activities is now clearer and easier to understand.
•
Activities 1.1 and 1.2 were expanded to three activities to ensure students get a solid
introduction to functions.
•
New problem situations were added in Activities 1.9, 1.13, 1.16, 2.2, 4.5, 4.6, and 5.7.
•
A new activity, Activity 1.14: Earth Week, was added on solving linear systems using
matrix methods.
•
Chapter 2 was rearranged so that exponents are covered separately from composition and
inverse functions. All exponent material is now found in Activities 2.3 and 2.4.
•
The coverage of exponential growth and decay was split into two activities. Activity 3.1:
The Summer Job covers exponential growth, and Activity 3.2: Half-Life of Medicine
covers exponential decay.
•
Chapter 4 was rearranged from three clusters to two. Activity 4.7: Complex Numbers is
now at the end of Cluster 1.
•
The discussion of trigonometric values of special angles is now included in Activity 6.1:
The Leaning Tower of Pisa.
•
Several activities have moved to the Instructor’s Resource Manual with Tests and
MyMathLab to streamline the course without loss of content.
•
Several activities have incorporated web-based exercises into the exercise sets.

To the Student
The book in your hands is most likely very different from any mathematics textbook you have
seen before. In this book, you will take an active role in developing the important ideas of
arithmetic and beginning algebra. You will be expected to add your own words to the text.
This will be part of your daily work, both in and out of class. It is the belief of the authors
that students learn mathematics best when they are actively involved in solving problems that
are meaningful to them.
The text is primarily a collection of situations drawn from real life. Each situation leads to
one or more problems. By answering a series of questions and solving each part of the prob-
lem, you will be using and learning one or more ideas of introductory college mathematics.
Sometimes, these will be basic skills that build on your knowledge of arithmetic. Other times,
they will be new concepts that are more general and far-reaching. The important point is that
you won’t be asked to master a skill until you see a real need for that skill as part of solving a
realistic application.
Another important aspect of this text and the course you are taking is the benefit gained by
collaborating with your classmates. Much of your work in class will result from being a
member of a team. Working in small groups, you will help each other work through a prob-
lem situation. While you may feel uncomfortable working this way at first, there are several
reasons we believe it is appropriate in this course. First, it is part of the learning-by-doing
philosophy. You will be talking about mathematics, needing to express your thoughts in
words. This is a key to learning. Secondly, you will be developing skills that will be very
valuable when you leave the classroom. Currently, many jobs and careers require the ability
to collaborate within a team environment. Your instructor will provide you with more spe-
cific information about this collaboration.
One more fundamental part of this course is that you will have access to appropriate technol-
ogy at all times. You will have access to calculators and some form of graphics tool—either a
calculator or computer. Technology is a part of our modern world, and learning to use tech-
nology goes hand in hand with learning mathematics. Your work in this course will help pre-
pare you for whatever you pursue in your working life.
This course will help you develop both the mathematical and general skills necessary in
today’s workplace, such as organization, problem solving, communication, and collaborative
skills. By keeping up with your work and following the suggested organization of the text,
you will gain a valuable resource that will serve you well in the future. With hard work and
dedication, you will be ready for the next step.

Modeling with Functions
Introduction
A key step in the problem-solving process is to look for relationships and connections between
the variable quantities in a given situation. Problems encountered in the world around us, in-
cluding the environment, medicine, economics, and the Internet, are often very complicated
and contain several variables. In this text, you will primarily deal with situations that contain
two variables. In many of these situations, the variables will have a special relationship called
a function.
Function
Did you have trouble finding a parking space this morning? Was the time that you arrived on
campus a factor? As part of a reconstruction project at a small community college, the num-
ber of cars in the parking lot was counted each hour from 7:00 A.M. to 10:00 P.M. on a partic-
ular day. The results are shown in the following table.
Activity 1.1

Objectives
1. Identify input and output
in situations involving two
variable quantities.
2. Identify a functional
relationship between two
variables.
3. Identify the independent
and dependent variables.
4. Use a table to numerically
represent a functional
relationship between two
variables.

3. Explain how the data in the Park It table fits the description of a function.
A functional relationship is stated as follows: “The output variable is a function of the input
variable.” Using x for the input variable and y for the output variable, the functional relation-
ship is stated “y is a function of x.” Because the input for the parking lot function is the time
of day and the output is the number of cars in the lot at that time, you write that the number
of cars in the parking lot is a function of the time of day.

Chapter 1
Function Sense
Definition
A function is a correspondence between an input variable and an output variable that
assigns a single output value to each input value. Therefore, for a function, any given
input value has exactly one corresponding output value. If x represents the input variable
and y represents the output variable, then the function assigns a single, unique y-value to
each x-value.
Example 1
Consider the following table listing the official high temperature 
(in °F) in the village of Lake Placid, New York, during the first week
of January. Note that the date has been designated the input and the
high temperature on that date the output. Is the high temperature a
function of the date?

This situation involves two variables, the time of day and the number of cars in the parking
lot. A variable, usually represented by a letter, is a quantity that may change in value from
one particular instance to another. Typically, one variable is designated as the input and the
other is called the output. The input is the value given first, and the output is the value that
corresponds to, or is determined by, the given input value.
1. In the parking lot situation, identify the input variable and the output variable.
2. a. For an input of 10:00 A.M., how many cars are in the parking lot (output)?
b. For an input of 5:00 P.M., how many cars are in the parking lot (output)?
c. For each value of input (time of day), how many different outputs (number of cars)
are there?
The set of data in the Park It table is an example of a mathematical function.

If the input and output in Example 1 are switched (see table below), the daily high tempera-
ture becomes the input and the date becomes the output. The date is not a function of the high
temperature. The input value 30 has two output values, 2 and 7.
4. Interchange the input and the output in the parking lot situation. Let the number of cars
in the lot be the input and the time of day be the output. Is the time of day a function of
the number of cars in the lot? Write a sentence explaining why this switch does or does
not fit the description of a function.

SOLUTION
From this table, you observe that the high temperature is a function of the date. For each date
there is exactly one high temperature. The relationships in this example can be visualized as
follows:
If d represents the input (date), and T represents the output (temperature), then T is a function
of d.

6. The independent variable in Example 1 is the date. The dependent variable is the tem-
perature. Identify the independent and dependent variables in Example 2.
Defining Functions Numerically
The input/output pairing in the parking lot function on page 1 is presented as a table of
matched pairs. In such a situation, the function is defined numerically. Another way to
define a function numerically is as a set of ordered pairs.
Definition
If the relationship between two variables is a function, the input variable is called the
independent variable, and the output variable is called the dependent variable. If x
represents the input variable, and y represents the output variable, then x is the independent
variable and y is the dependent variable.
5. Determine whether or not each situation describes a function. Give a reason for your answer.
a. The amount of property tax you have to pay is a function of the assessed value of
the house.
b. The weight of a letter in ounces is a function of the postage paid for mailing the letter.
c. The speed at which a free-falling baseball strikes the ground is a function of the
height from which it was dropped.
d. The amount of your savings account is a function of your salary.
Example 2
Determine whether or not the following situation describes a function.
Give a reason for your answer.
The amount of postage for a letter is a function of the weight of the letter.
SOLUTION
Yes, this statement does describe a function. The weight of the letter is the input, and the
amount of postage is the output. Each letter has one weight. This weight determines the
postage necessary for the letter. There is only one amount of postage for each letter. Therefore,
for each value of input (weight of the letter) there is one output (postage). Note that if w
represents the input (weight of the letter), and p represents the output (postage), then p is a
function of w.

8. In Example 1, the high temperature in Lake Placid is a function of the date.
Convert to ordered pairs all the values in the Almost Freezing table on page 2.
Function Notation
There is a special notation for functions in which the function itself is represented by a name or
letter. For example, the function that relates the time of day to the number of cars can be repre-
sented by the letter f. Let t represent time, the input variable, and let c represent the number of
cars, the output variable. The following simplification (really an abbreviation) is now possible.
The final function notation is read “c equals f of t.”
Notice that the output c (the number of cars) is equal to 
So 
is the output of f when
the input is t. For example, 
represents the number of cars (the output of f ) when the
input is 1400 (at 2 P.M.).
f 114002

c = f 1t2.

1input value, output value2.
Definition
A function may be defined numerically as a set of ordered pairs in which the first
number of each pair represents the input value and the second number represents 
the corresponding output value. No two ordered pairs have the same input value and
different output values.
Example 3
The ordered pair (3, 4) is distinct from the ordered pair (4, 3). In the
ordered pair (3, 4), 3 is the input and 4 is the output. In the ordered
pair (4, 3), 4 is the input and 3 is the output.
Example 4
(9:00 A.M., 384) or (0900, 384) (using a 24-hour clock) is an ordered
pair that is part of the parking lot function.
7. Using a 24-hour clock, write three other ordered pairs for the parking lot function.
In general, function notation is written as follows:
The input variable or input value is also called the argument of the function.
output variable = name of function 1input variable2.

SUMMARY: ACTIVITY 1.1
1. A variable, usually represented by a letter, is a quantity that may change in value from one 
particular instance to another.
2. In a situation involving two variables, one variable is designated the input and the other the
output. The input is the value given first, and the output is the value that corresponds to or is
determined by the given input value.
3. A function is a rule relating an input variable (sometimes called the argument) and an output
variable so that a single output value is assigned to each input value. In such a case, you state
that the output variable is a function of the input variable.
4. Independent variable is another name for the input variable of a function.
Example 5
Values from the table or ordered pairs for the parking lot function can
be written as follows using function notation.

You probably need to fill your car with gas more often than you would like.You commute to
college each day and to a part–time job each weekend. Your car gets good gas mileage, but
the recent dramatic fluctuation in gas prices has wreaked havoc on your budget.
1. There are two input variables that determine the cost (output) of a fill-up. What are they?
Be specific.
2. Assume you need 12.6 gallons to fill up your car. Now one of the input variables in
Problem 1 will become a constant. The value of a constant will not vary throughout the
problem. The cost of a fill-up is now dependent on only one variable, the price per gallon.

3. a. Write a verbal statement that describes how the cost of a fill-up is determined.
b. Let p represent the price of a gallon of gasoline pumped (input) and c represent the
cost of the fill-up (output). Translate the verbal statement in part a into a symbolic
statement (an equation) that expresses c in terms of p.
Defining Functions by a Symbolic Rule (Equation)
The symbolic rule (equation) 
is an example of a second method of defining a func-
tion. Recall that the first method is numerical (tables and ordered pairs).
4. a. Use the given equation to determine the cost of a fill-up at a price of $3.60 per gallon.
b. Explain the steps that you used to determine the cost in part a.
Recall from Activity 1.1 that function notation is an efficient and convenient way of repre-
senting the output variable. The equation 
may be written using the function nota-
tion by replacing c with 
as follows.
Now, if the price per gallon is $3.60, then the cost of a fill-up can be represented by 
To evaluate 
substitute 3.60 for p in 
as follows.
f 13.602 = 12.613.602 = 45.36
f 1p2 = 12.6p

The results can be written as 
or as the ordered pair (3.60, 45.36). Therefore,
at a price of $3.60 per gallon, the cost of filling your car with 12.6 gallons of gas will be $45.36.

2. Distinguish between a

3. Graph a function using
technology.
A very effective method of representing a function is graphically. The way in which the out-
put quantity changes as the input increases can often be more readily identified in visual
form. A graph can also show any trends or patterns in the function situation. In the follow-
ing problems, you will investigate the graphical representation of the Park It function in
Activity 1.1 and the cost-of-fill-up function in Activity 1.2.
Defining Functions Graphically
You may have seen an ordered pair before as the coordinates of a point in a rectangular 
coordinate system, typically using ordered pairs of the form 
where x is the input and
y is the output. The first value, the horizontal coordinate, indicates the directed distance (right
or left) from the vertical axis. The second value, the vertical coordinate, indicates the directed
distance (up or down) from the horizontal axis.
The variables may not always be represented by x and y, but the horizontal axis will always
be the input axis, and the vertical axis will always be the output axis.
1. Using a 24-hour clock, convert to ordered pairs all the values in the Park It table on
page 1. Plot each ordered pair on the following grid. Set your axes and scales by noting
the smallest and largest values for both input and output. Label each axis by both the
variable name and its designation as input or output. Remember, the scale for the hori-
zontal axis does not have to be the same as the scale for the vertical axis. However,
each scale (vertical and horizontal) must be divided into equal intervals.

The preceding graph, which consists of a set of labeled axes and 16 points, presents the same
information that is in the Park It table, but in a different way. It shows the information as a
graph and therefore defines the function graphically.
2. a. Determine the practical domain of the Park It function.
b. Determine the practical range of the function. Assume that the capacity of the park-
ing lot is 600 cars.
c. Describe any patterns or trends that you observe in the graph.
d. Can the Park It function be defined symbolically? Explain.

Activity 1.3
Graphically Speaking
19
Note that the graph of the Park It function consists of 16 distinct points that are not con-
nected. The input variable (time of day) is defined only for the car counts in the parking lot
for each hour from 7 A.M. to 10 P.M. The Park It function is said to be discrete because it is
defined only at isolated, distinct input values (practical domain). The function is not defined
for input values between these particular values.
Caution.
In order to use the graph for a relationship such as the parking lot situation to
make predictions or to recognize patterns, it is convenient to connect the points with line
segments. This creates a type of continuous graph. This changes the domain shown in the
graph from “some values” to “all values.” Therefore, you need to be cautious. Connecting data
points may cause confusion when working with real-world situations.

Defining Functions: A Summary
A function can be defined by a written statement (verbally), symbolically, numerically, and
graphically. The following example illustrates the different ways that the gross pay function
can be defined.

number of hours worked. If you earn $9.50 per hour, then define the
gross pay function verbally, symbolically, numerically, and graphically.
SOLUTION:
Verbal Definition: A Statement of the Definition of the Function:
The gross pay will be the number of hours worked multiplied by $9.50.

vehicle by measuring the length of the skid distance. The following table gives the average
skid distances for an automobile with good tires on dry pavement.

1. Does the table data define speed as a function of skid distance? Explain using the defini-
tion of function.
2. Identify the independent variable and the dependent variable.
3. Plot the (input, output) ordered pairs on an appropriately scaled and labeled set of coor-
dinate axes. Remember, the input values appear along the horizontal axis, and the output
values appear along the vertical axis.
After a particular accident, a skid distance was measured to be 200 feet. From the table, the
investigating officer knows that the speed of the vehicle was between 65 and 75 miles per
hour. She would, however, like to be able to be more precise in reporting the speed. One way
of getting values that are not listed in the table is to use a graph or equation of a function that
best fits the actual data.

Note that the points on the graph in Problem 3 do not lie exactly on a specific curve.
However, calculators can produce an equation that best models actual data. From the data in
the table on page 28, the TI-83/TI-84 Plus can be used to generate the following model:
where x represents the length of skid distances in feet and 
represents the speed in miles
per hour. The process for generating these equations is covered in later activities.

A mathematical model is an equation or a graph that fits or approximates the actual
data. The model can be used to predict output values for input values not in the table.
b. The values in the table The Long and Short of It can help to set appropriate window
values in your calculator to view the graph. Starting at a minimum skid distance of 0,
a reasonable maximum value of the skid distance in this situation would be 450 feet.
Beginning at a minimum speed of 0, a reasonable maximum speed value would be
100 mph. Using these settings, the window screen should appear as follows:

A function is increasing if its graph goes up to the right, decreasing if its graph goes
down to the right, and constant if its graph is horizontal. In each case, you are viewing
the graph as a point moves along the curve from left to right, that is, as the input values
increase.

Problem 9 illustrates what is known as the vertical line test. You know that a function can
have only one output value for each input value. Since any two points with the same first co-
ordinate lie on a vertical line, a graph defines a function if any vertical line drawn through the
graph intersects the graph no more than once. This is called the vertical line test.

The expression “a picture is worth a thousand words” is a cliché, but it is true. Functions are
often easier to understand when presented in visual form. To understand such pictures, you
need to practice going back and forth between graphs and word descriptions.
Every graph shows how the inputs and outputs change in relation to one another. As you read
a graph from left to right, the input variable is increasing in value. The graph indicates the
change in the output values (increasing, decreasing, or constant) as the input values increase.
The graph of an 
increasing function 
rises to the right.
The graph of a 
decreasing function 
falls to the right.

If a function increases and then decreases, the point where the graph changes from rising to

rising is called a minimum point. The y-value of this point is called a local minimum value.

As you read the graph in Example 1 from left to right, it shows how your distance from your
car changes as time passes. One possible scenario this graph describes is:
You leave your car and walk at a steady pace toward the library. You meet some friends and
stop to chat for a while. You realize that you forgot something and quickly return to your car.
After rummaging around for a while, you hurry off to the library.
How did anyone come up with this from the graph? Look at the graph in sections.
a. The first increasing line segment indicates you are moving away from your car because
the time and the distance are increasing.
b. The first horizontal section indicates that your distance from the car is constant, so you
are standing still.
c. The decreasing line segment indicates your distance from the car is decreasing. When it
reaches the horizontal axis, it tells you that you are back at your car.
d. The second horizontal segment indicates you stay at your car for a time.
e. The final increasing segment is steeper and longer than the first, so you are moving away
from the car faster and farther than in the first segment.

Suppose you are a member of a health-and-fitness club. A special diet and exercise program
has been developed for you by your personal trainer. At the beginning of the program, and
once a week thereafter, you are tested on the treadmill. The test consists of how many min-
utes it takes you to walk, jog, or run 3 miles on the treadmill. The following data gives your
time, t, over an 8-week period.

Determining Total Change
The change in time, t, is represented by the symbol 
The symbol 
(delta) is used to rep-
resent “change in.” You generally calculate the change in time, t, from a first (initial) value
to a second (final) value of t. The first time is represented by 
(read “t sub 1”), and the sec-
ond time is represented by 
(read “t sub 2”). The change in t is then calculated by subtract-
ing the first (initial) value from the second (final) value. This is symbolically represented by
Because t is the output variable, 
is the change in output.
Similarly,

represents the first (initial) value of w;

2. a. What was your treadmill time at the beginning of the program?
b. What was your treadmill time at the end of the first week?
An important question that can be asked about this situation is, how did your time change
from one week to the next?
3. a. During which week(s) did your time increase?
b. During which week(s) did your time decrease?
c. During which week(s) did your time remain unchanged?
4. Your time decreased during each week of the first 4 weeks of the program.
a. Determine the total change in time, t, during the first 4 weeks of the program (i.e.,
from 
to 
). Why should your answer contain a negative sign? Explain.
b. Determine the change in weeks, w, during this period (i.e., from

Average Rate of Change
Neither the change in treadmill time nor the change in the number of weeks completely de-
scribes your progress during the first 4 weeks. The ratio of the change in 
to the change
in 
written 
provides more relevant information about the effect of the exercise 
program over time. This ratio, 
shows how the time changed on average over the 4-week
period.
6. Use your results from Problem 5 to determine the ratio 
during the first 4-week pe-
riod. Interpret your answer.
7. a. What are the units of measurement of the ratio determined in Problem 6?
b. On your graph from Problem 1, connect the points (0, 45) and (4, 38) with a line
segment. Does the output increase, decrease, or remain unchanged over the interval?

2. a. Does there appear to be a linear relationship between the years since 1996–1997 and
the cost of tuition?
b. As the years since 1996–1997 increase, what is the general trend in the tuition costs?
3. Using a straightedge (a taut string or dry strand of spaghetti is helpful in positioning the
line), draw a line that will have as many data points as close to the line as possible. The
line you are drawing is called the line of best fit.
The accepted method for determining the line of best fit to a set of data is called the method
of least squares. This method is used to calculate a slope and y-intercept. The line with this
slope and y-intercept is called the regression line for your data. Your graphing calculator is
programmed with an algorithm that determines the regression line.

Linear Correlation
When a linear pattern is evident in a scatterplot, there is said to be a linear correlation be-
tween the two variables. (When the word correlation appears by itself, it usually means
linear correlation.) Your calculator window in Problem 4c should have included a value for r,
called the correlation coefficient. (If it didn’t, see Appendix C to enter DiagnosticOn.)
Note that the correlation coefficient is generally rounded to the nearest hundredth.
The value of the correlation coefficient indicates how strong a linear relationship exists be-
tween the two variables under consideration. The value of r ranges between 
and 1. When
the value of r is closer to zero, you would conclude that there is little or no linear correlation.
The closer r is to either 1 or 
the stronger the linear correlation between the two variables.
- 1,

r = 0.9972794 or r = 1.00
r  1
r  0.06

If 
then all the data points lie exactly on a straight line with positive slope. In this case
there is a perfect positive correlation. If 
then all the decreasing data points lie ex-
actly on a straight line with negative slope. In this case there is a perfect negative correlation.
The strength of the correlation is generally best described by both the correlation coefficient
and a visual interpretation of the scatterplot. The following scatterplots with their respective
correlation coefficients should help make this clear.

Cause-and-Effect Relationships
A strong correlation between two variables does not necessarily mean that a cause-and-effect
relationship exists between the two variables. For example, there is a strong positive correla-
tion between height and weight. However, an increase in height does not necessarily cause an
increase in weight. There are many other variables that could cause the increase in weight
such as gender, age, or body type. Such variables are often called lurking variables, hidden
in the background and not explicitly measured.

between the amount of natural gas usage and the outside temperature. Is there a
cause-and-effect relationship between these two variables? Explain.

correlation between people with two cars and a longer life span. Is there a cause-

SUMMARY: ACTIVITY 1.10
1. The linear regression equation is the linear equation that “best fits” a set of data.
2. The regression line is a mathematical model for the data.
3. Interpolation is the process of using a regression equation to predict a value of output for an
input value that lies within the boundaries of the given data.
4. Extrapolation is the process of using a regression equation to predict a value of output for
an input value that lies outside the boundaries of the given data.
5. A correlation coefficient, r, measures how strongly two related variables follow a linear
pattern. The value of r ranges between 
and 1. When the value of r is closer to zero, you
would conclude that there is little or no linear correlation. The closer r is to either 1 or 
the stronger the linear correlation between the two variables. If 
a negative correlation,
then the linear pattern follows a negative slope. If 
a positive correlation, then the lin-
ear pattern follows a positive slope.

system of linear equations.
Such a linear system of two equations in two variables can be written
A solution of the system, if it exists, is the ordered pair of numbers (x, y) that makes
both equations true. If the system has exactly one solution, the system is called

SOLUTION
Since equation (1) is solved for y, substitute 
for y into equation (2) to get
To solve the equation for x, you need to isolate the variable. Rewrite the equation so that all
terms involving x are on one side and all other terms are on the other side. This is generally
accomplished by adding and/or subtracting the appropriate terms to/from each side of the
equation.

y = 5x + 14
y = 3x - 10
You first solved the system numerically in Problem 3 by completing the table and noting the
value of the input that produced the same output. You then solved this system graphically in
Problem 4 by locating the point of intersection of the two lines.
Substitution Method
You can also use algebraic methods to solve systems of equations. One algebraic method is
the substitution method. To use the substitution method, you solve one of the equations for
one of the variables and then substitute for that variable in the other equation. The following
example illustrates this method.
Subtract 5x from both sides and collect like terms.
Add 10 to each side and collect like terms.
Divide each side by 
the coefficient of the 
variable x.
2,
To determine the corresponding y-value, substitute 
for x into either of the original equa-
tions and solve for y. Substituting into equation (1),
Remember that the ordered pair 
represents the point of intersection of the two
lines as well as the solution to the system. This is verified by the following screen.

y = 31- 122 - 10 = - 36 - 10 = - 46

For the truck rental problem, you want C (total cost) to be the same for both functions.
Because each expression is solved for C, set the expressions equal to each other. You are sub-

The linear system in Problem 9 is said to be inconsistent. There is no solution because
the lines never intersect. Graphically, the slopes of the lines are equal, but the vertical in-
tercepts are different. Therefore, the graphs are parallel lines. Solving such an equation
algebraically results in a false equation such as 30 = 0.
The system in Problem 10 is an example of a dependent system. Graphically, in such a
system, both equations represent the same line. The system has an infinite number of
solutions. Solving a dependent system algebraically results in an equation that is true for
all t, such as 0 = 0.

1. Let x represent the number of middle school student participants, y represent the num-
ber of high school student participants, and z the number of community college student
participants. Write a 
linear system that describes this situation.
Suppose you solve this system algebraically. Do the variables actually enter into the calcula-
tions? The answer is, “not really.” The variables are important in setting up (placement or
alignment) the system. But once the system is set up, the variables represent a position within
the system. It is the coefficients and the constants that are important.
Using just the coefficients and constants, any system of linear equations can be represented
by a matrix.

Definition
Any rectangular array of numbers or symbols is called a matrix. That is, a matrix is a
systematic arrangement of numbers or symbols in rows and columns.
Matrices are very useful for displaying information. The following example demonstrates
how a system of linear equations can be represented by a matrix.
Example 1
Consider the 
linear system
Note that the variables x, y, and z hold a particular position in the system of equations. The
system can be viewed as an array of numbers.
The matrix
derived from the linear system is called the matrix of coefficients. Note that the first column
contains the coefficients of the variable x in the system. The second and third columns are the
coefficients of the y and z variables, respectively.

Now, to solve a system using matrices, you use a combination of operations on the rows of the
augmented matrix to obtain new matrices that give the same solution as the original system.
The matrix
also derived from the same linear system, is called the augmented matrix. The fourth col-
umn contains the constants on the right side of the system.

In general, your strategy is first to change the number in the first column, first row, to a 1.
1. Interchange the rows to obtain
2. Divide the first row by 3.
Next, you want to change the number in the first column, second row, to a 0.
3. Multiply the first row by 
and add it to the second row to obtain
Now, change the number in the second column, second row, to a 1.
4. Divide the second row by 27.
Last, change the number in the second column, first row, to a 0.
5. Multiply the second row by 3 and add to the first.

Solving Inequalities in One Variable Numerically 
and Graphically
Definition
Solving an inequality in one variable is the process of determining the values of the
variable that make the inequality a true statement. These values are called the solutions
of the inequality.

Solving Inequalities in One Variable Algebraically
The process of solving an inequality in one variable algebraically is very similar to solving
an equation in one variable algebraically. Your goal is to isolate the variable on one side of
the inequality symbol. You isolate the variable in an equation by performing the same opera-
tions to both sides of the equation so as not to upset the balance. You isolate the variable in
an inequality by performing the same operations to both sides so as not to upset the
imbalance.

Therefore, from Example 2, any number less than 3 is a solution to the inequality
The solution set can be represented on a number line by shading
all points to the left of 3:
3(x - 4) 7 5(x - 2) - 8.
The open circle at 3 indicates that 3 is not a solution. A closed circle indicates that the num-
ber beneath the closed circle is a solution. The arrow shows that the solutions extend indefi-
nitely to the left.

Compound Inequality
You have joined a health-and-fitness club. Your aerobics instructor recommends that to
achieve the most cardiovascular benefit from your workout, you should maintain your pulse
rate between a lower and upper range of values. These values depend on your age.
8. If the variable a represents your age, then the lower and upper values for your pulse rate
are determined by the following.
a. Determine your lower value.
b. Determine your upper value.
For the most cardiovascular benefit, a 20-year-old’s pulse rate should be between 144 and
174. The phrase “between 144 and 174” means the pulse rate should be greater than 144 and
less than 174. Symbolically, this combination or compound inequality is written as
This statement is written more compactly as 
The numbers that satisfy this compound inequality can be represented on a number line as
144 6 pulse rate 6 174.

Interval Notation
Interval notation is an alternative method to represent a set of real numbers described by
an inequality. The closed interval
represents all real numbers x for which
The square brackets [ ] indicate that the endpoints of the interval are 
- 3 … x … 4.

included. The open interval
represents all real numbers for which 
Note that the parentheses ( ) indicate that the endpoints are not included. The interval
is said to be half-open or half-closed. The interval is open at 
(endpoint not in-
cluded) and closed at 4 (endpoint included).
Suppose you want to represent the set of real numbers for which is greater than 3. The
symbol 
(positive infinity) is used to indicate unboundedness in the positive direction.
Therefore, the interval 
represents all real numbers 
for which 
Note that

The symbol

Activity 1.16
Sales Commission
147
As an incentive to obtain more sales, a salesperson is often paid on a commission basis. 
A common commission scheme is the accumulative plateau method. Using this method, a
salesperson is paid commission at a greater rate for a greater level of sales.
A particular company pays commission as follows:
5% on sales up to $10,000
7.5% on the next $10,000 in sales
10% on all sales over $20,000
For example,
i. The commission on $8000 in sales is 5% of $8000:
ii. The commission on $12,000 in sales is 5% of the first $10,000 plus 7.5% of the sales
over $10,000:
iii. The commission on $27,000 in sales is 5% of the first $10,000 plus 7.5% of the second
$10,000 plus 10% of the sales over $20,000:
1. a. How much will a salesperson earn in commission on $6000 in sales?
b. How much will a salesperson earn in commission on $15,000 in sales? 
Note: The 7.5% rate only applies to sales above $10,000.
c. How much will a salesperson earn in commission on $24,000 in sales? 
Note: The 10% rate only applies to sales above $20,000.
2. Is the commission earned a function of the amount of the sales? Explain.
Note that when using the accumulation plateau method, the commission earned is calculated
differently depending on the level (plateau) of sales.
500 + 750 + 0.10170002 = 1250 + 700 = $1950.
0.05 # 10,000 + 0.75 # 2000 = 500 + 150 = $650.
0.05 # 8000 = $400.

The equations in Problem 3 are all part of one piecewise function, the commission function.
This piecewise function is written in the following form:
Note that in the form a piecewise function is written, each row represents one piece of the func-
tion. The equation for one of the function pieces is followed by the interval over which that
equation applies. All the pieces are joined together by the brace to the left of the equations.
To determine the commission earned, f s , for a particular sales amount, s, you first look at
each interval in the definition to determine the interval in which the value of s is contained.

Cell Phone Minutes
A major wireless company offers a plan that includes 450 anytime minutes for $39.99 per
month. This is the least expensive plan, and many people choose it for that reason. However,
this plan can become expensive for someone who goes over the 450 minutes in 1 month.
There is a $0.45 charge for each minute over 450 in 1 month.
6. Suppose you have signed up for this plan. Complete the following table.
Minutes Used in One Month
200

The method used to determine the cost for 500 minutes is different from the method used to
determine the charge for 200, 300, or 400 minutes. This is another example of a piecewise
function. The input for this function is the total number of anytime minutes used in 1 month,
and the output is the cost for that month.

An ordered pair of numbers consists of
two numbers written in the form 
(input value, output value).
The order in which they are listed is 
significant.
(2, 3) is an ordered pair. In this pair, 
2 is the input and 3 is the output.
Verbally defined function [1.1]
A function is defined verbally when it is
defined using words.
The high temperature in Albany,
New York, is a function of the day
of the year, because for each day
there is one high temperature.
Numerically defined function [1.1]
A function is defined numerically using 
ordered pairs.
The Park It table (page 1) in Activity 1.1
is a numerically defined function
because for each hour there is only

A function is defined graphically when
the input variable is represented on the
horizontal axis and the output variable 
on the vertical axis.
The graph drawn on page 18 in
Problem 1 of Activity 1.3 defines 
a function.
Mathematical model [1.4]
A function can be used as a mathematical
model that best fits the actual data and can
be used to predict output values for input
values not in the table.

(page 30).
Vertical line test [1.4]
A graph defines a function if any vertical
line intersects the graph no more than
once. This is called the vertical line test.
No circle can represent a function 
because a vertical line through the
center will pass through the circle
twice, indicating that there is at least
one input value paired with two 
different output values.
Average rate of change [1.6]
The average rate of change of a function
over a specified input interval is the ratio

You are planning a trip with friends and are going to rent a van. The van you want rents for $75
per day. You are given 100 free miles each day and are charged $0.20 per mile for extra miles.
The dealer claims that you can expect to average 25 miles per gallon. The Auto Club says you
can expect to pay an average of $2.50 per gallon for gas on your trip. You are planning to be
gone for 8 days, and you know that you will be traveling at least 1000 miles on the trip. You
have been assigned the job of estimating the total cost of operating the van for the trip.
1. The cost of renting the van is a function of the total number of miles driven on the trip.
Note that with 100 free miles each day, you will not have to pay for 800 miles of the trip
over the 8 days.
a. Complete the following table. 
represents the cost of renting the van for a given
total number of miles, m, driven in the 8 days.

restaurant. The restaurant will charge $100 for the banquet room, plus $12.50 per person for
each meal. You will pay these expenses yourself. From past experience, you can expect to make
sales to about 15% of the people attending. You also know that the average in sales you can 
expect from each new client is $750, for which you receive a 13% commission. It is clear that
your personal financial success from the event depends on how many people you can attract to

Definition
Scientific notation is a convenient way to write a very large (or small) number. A
positive number is written in scientific notation as a number (the base) between 1 
and 10 times a power of 10. A negative number is written as a number (the base)
between 
and 
times a power of 10.

Notice that to convert a number whose absolute value is greater than 1 from scientific
notation to decimal notation, you move the decimal point of the base to the right, the
number of decimal places being indicated by the exponent of the power of 10.

Decimal Notation to Scientific Notation
In English units, light travels approximately 5,880,000,000,000 miles in 1 year. This distance
is called the light-year. If you enter 5,880,000,000,000 into the calculator, it converts the
number to scientific notation and returns 5.88E12.
5. a. Write the number 5,880,000,000,000 in scientific notation.
b. Describe the process the calculator used to convert 5,880,000,000,000 into 5.88E12.
8.37 * 1012
Example 2
Convert 345,000,000 into scientific notation.
SOLUTION
Because the first nonzero digit is 3, the decimal part of the number is 3.45. Because the deci-
mal point needs to be moved eight places to produce 3.45, the exponent on the 10 is 8.
Therefore, 
in scientific notation.
345,000,000 = 3.45 * 108
6. Convert the following decimal numbers into scientific notation.
a. 7,605,000,000,000
b. - 98,300,000
Division Property of Exponents
Light travels at a speed of approximately 300,000 kilometers per second or approximately
25,920,000,000 kilometers per day. The nearest star to Earth other than the Sun is Proxima
Centauri, which is approximately 39,740,000,000,000 kilometers from Earth. How long does
it take light from Proxima Centauri to reach Earth?
In general, to convert a number whose absolute value is greater than 1 from decimal no-
tation into scientific notation, move the decimal point to the immediate right of the first
nonzero digit. Count the decimal places moved. This number is the exponent of the
power of 10.

Activity 2.3

201
The answer to the question is determined by dividing 39,740,000,000,000 kilometers by
25,920,000,000 kilometers per day. If you do this with your calculator, it produces the fol-
lowing screen.
7. Change the mode of the calculator to Scientific Notation (Sci).
Now divide 39,740,000,000,000 kilometers per day by 25,920,000,000 kilometers by
entering both numbers into your calculator in scientific notation. How does your result
compare to the result performed in Normal mode?
8. Look at this calculation in scientific notation more closely:
a. The 1.533179012 is a result of dividing 3.974 by 2.592. Check this result with your
calculator.
b. The

This means that 
Note that
Rather than expanding the powers and dividing out the common factors, you can ob-
tain the exponent 3 from the exponents of the powers you are dividing. You simply
subtract the exponent in the denominator, 10, from the exponent in the numerator, 13.
Problem 8b demonstrates another important property of exponents.

To answer this question, divide 149,600,000 kilometers by 25,920,000,000 kilometers per

SUMMARY: ACTIVITY 2.3
1. In scientific notation, a positive number is written as a number (the base) between 1 and 
10 times a power of 10. A negative number is written as a number (the base) between 
and
times a power of 10.
2. To convert a number whose absolute value is greater than 1 from scientific notation to
decimal notation, you move the decimal point of the base to the right, the number of decimal
places being indicated by the exponent of the power of 10.
3. To convert a number whose absolute value is greater than 1 from decimal notation into
scientific notation, move the decimal point to the immediate right of the first nonzero digit.
Count the decimal places moved. This number is the exponent of the power of 10.

In calculating the volumes in Problem 5, you followed a two-step calculation.
Step 1.
First you used the degrees Celsius, C, as the input to 
to
convert the temperature to degrees Fahrenheit.
Step 2. Then you used this output, degrees Fahrenheit, as the input to the function
to obtain the volume, V.
To shorten this calculation, you can combine these two functions in a special way as described
in Problem 6.

Definition
When the output of the composition of two functions is always the same as the input of the
composition, the two functions are inverses of one another. Each function “undoes” the
other. Symbolically, if functions f and g are inverses, then 
and g1f 1x22 = x.
f 1g1x22 = x
Example 1
Show that f and g, defined by 
and 
are
inverses.
SOLUTION
First check the composition

This verifies the first equation. Now check 
Since 
f, and g are inverses.
f 1g1x22 = g1 f 1x22 = x,

8. Are the functions h and c in Problem 7 inverses? Explain.
In general, the inverse of a function f is written 
Using this notation,

Inverse Functions
•
The two functions f and g are inverses if 
and 
•
The notation for the inverse of f is 
•
The domain of f is the range of 
and the range of f is the domain of 
Important Note About Notation
The notation for the inverse function of f is potentially confusing. The 
in 
is
not an exponent! The notation is derived from the fact that the inverse function undoes
the arithmetic operations of the original function. You may have seen 
used as an ex-
ponent to denote the reciprocal of a number:

An important property of inverse functions is that the domain and range values are inter-
changed. For example, from the first table in this section,
If the input and output values of each ordered pair are interchanged, you have
These ordered pairs match the (input, output) pairs of the function c, the inverse of h. See the

Your neighbor’s son will be attending college in the fall, majoring in mathematics. On July 1,
he comes to your house looking for summer work to help pay for college expenses. You are
interested since you need some odd jobs done, but you don’t have a lot of extra money to pay
him. He can start right away and will work all day, July 1 for 2 cents. This gets your attention,
but you wonder if there is a catch. He says that he will work July 2 for 4 cents, July 3 for 
8 cents, July 4 for 16 cents, and so on for every day of the month of July.

When you take medicine, your body metabolizes and eliminates the medication until there
is none left in your body. The half-life of a medication is the time is takes for your body to
eliminate one-half of the amount present. For many people the half-life of the medicine
Prozac is 1 day.

Prozac is taken and let Q represent the fraction of the dose of Prozac remaining in
your body.

Notice that the equation

given in the previous activity. However, the value of b for this exponential function is ,
which is not greater than 1. Therefore, the base is not a growth factor.
When the base, b, of an exponential function is between 0 and 1, the base is called a decay
factor. The result is a decreasing exponential function.

c. As a consequence of the result found in part b, you can start with the number of cell

Definition
The half-life of an exponential function is the time it takes for an output to decay 
by one-half. The half-life is determined by the decay factor and remains the same for all
output values.
Example 3
The population of Buffalo, New York, can be modeled by the equation
with 
representing the year 1970 and 
representing the population in thousands. If the population of Buffalo
continues to decline at the same rate, determine the number of years 
it will take for the population of Buffalo to be one half of the 1970
population.
SOLUTION
The equation indicates that the population of Buffalo, NY, in 1970 
is
thousand people. Therefore, half of that is 551 thousand people.

SUMMARY: ACTIVITY 3.3
1. For exponential functions defined by 
, a is the value of f when 
(sometimes
called the initial value), and b is the growth or decay factor.
2. The vertical intercept of these functions is 10, a2.
3. In an exponential function, equally spaced input values yield output values whose successive
ratios are constant. If the input values increase by 1 unit, then
a. the constant ratio is the growth factor if the output values are increasing
b. the constant ratio is the decay factor if the output values are decreasing
4. The doubling time of an increasing exponential function is the time it takes for an output to
double. The doubling time is set by the growth factor and remains the same for all output
values.
5. The half-life of a decreasing exponential function is the time it takes for an output to decay
by one-half. The half-life is determined by the decay factor and remains the same for all out-

Congratulations, you have inherited $20,000! Your grandparents suggest that you use half of
the inheritance to start a retirement fund. Your grandfather claims that an investment of
$10,000 could grow to over half a million dollars by the time of retirement. You are intrigued
by this statement and decide to investigate if this could happen.
1. a. Suppose the $10,000 is deposited in a bank at a 6.5% annual interest. What is the
interest earned after 1 year?
b. Suppose you left the money in the account for 10 years. Can the total amount of in-
terest on your investment be calculated by multiplying your answer in part a by 10?
What assumption are you making if you said yes?
Recall that for simple interest on an investment, the interest earned during the first period
does not earn interest for the rest of the life of the investment. Therefore, at 6.5% simple an-
nual interest, the $10,000 would earn a total interest of 
The interest paid on savings accounts in most banks is compound interest. The interest
earned for each period is added to the previous principal before the next interest calculation
is made. Simply stated, interest earns interest.
For example, if you deposit $10,000 in the bank at 6.5%, the balance after 1 year is
The interest, $650, earned during the year becomes part of the new balance. At the end of the
second year, your balance is
Note that you made interest on the original deposit, plus interest on the first year’s interest. In
this situation, we say that interest is compounded. Usually, the compounding occurs at fixed
intervals (typically at the end of every year, quarter, month, or day). In this example, interest
is compounded annually.
10,650 + 0.065110,6502 = 10,650 + 692.25 = 11,342.25.
10,000 + 0.065110,0002 = 10,000 + 650 = 10,650.
10,00010.06521102 = $6500.
If interest is compounded, then the current balance is given by the formula
where A is the current balance, or compound amount in the account,
P is the principal (the original amount deposited),
r is the annual interest rate (in decimal form),
n is the number of times per year that interest is compounded, and
t is the time in years the money has been invested.
The given formula for the compound amount A is called the compound interest formula.
A = P A1 + r

nt,
Example 1
You invest $100 at 4% compounded quarterly. How much money 
do you have after 5 years?
SOLUTION
The principal is $100, so 
The annual interest rate is 4%, so 
Interest is com-
pounded quarterly, that is, 4 times per year, so 
The money is invested for 5 years, so
Substituting the values for the P, r, n, and t in the compound interest formula, you have
A = 100A1 + 0.04

Continuous Compounding
You could extend this problem so that interest is compounded every hour or every minute or
even every second. However, compounding more frequently than every hour does not in-
crease the balance very much.

The growth rate is the percentage by which the balance grows by in 1 year. It is called the
effective yield,
Notice that as the number of compounding periods increases, the effective
yield increases. This means that with the same annual interest rate (APR), your investment
will earn more with more compounding periods.

If the compounding periods become shorter and shorter (compounding every hour, every
minute, every second), n gets larger and larger. If you consider the period to be so short that
it’s essentially an instant in time, you have what is called continuous compounding. Some
banks use this method for compounding interest.
The compound interest formula 
is no longer used when interest is com-
pounded continuously. The following develops a formula for continuous compounding.
Step 1. Rewrite the given formula as indicated using properties of exponents.
Step 2. Let 
It follows that 
Note that as n gets very large, the value of x also gets
very large.

money will you have after 5 years?
SOLUTION
The principal is $100, so 
The annual interest rate is 4%, so 
The money
is invested for 5 years, so 
Because interest is compounded continuously, you use the
formula for continuous compounding as follows.

The U.S. Census Bureau estimated that the U.S. population in July 2007 was 301,290,332.
The U.S. population in July 2008 was estimated to be 304,059,724.
1. Assuming exponential growth, the U.S. population y can be modeled by the equation
where t is the number of years since July 2007. Therefore, 
corresponds
to July 2007.
a. What is the initial value, a?
b. Determine the annual growth factor, b, for the U.S. population.
c. What is the annual growth rate?
d. Write the equation for the U.S. population as a function of t.
The U.S. population did not remain constant at 301,290,332 from July 2007 to June 2008 and
then jump to 304,059,724 on July 1, 2008. The population grew continuously throughout the
year. The exponential function used to model continuous growth is the same function used to
model continuous compounding for an investment.
Recall from Activity 3.5 that the formula for continuous compounding is 
where A
(output) is the amount of the investment, P is the initial principal, r is the compounding rate,
t (input) is time, and e is the constant irrational number. When this function is used more gen-
erally, it is written as
where A has been replaced by y, the output;
P replaced by a, the initial value; and
r replaced by k, the continuous growth rate.
Now, the exponential growth model for the U.S. population determined in Problem 1d, writ-
ten in the form 
can be rewritten equivalently in the continuous growth form,
Since y represents the same output value in each case, 
Since a represents
the same initial value in each model, it follows that

Now, consider a situation which involves continuous decay at a constant percentage rate.
Tylenol (acetaminophen) is metabolized in your body and eliminated at the rate of 24% per
hour. You take two Tylenol tablets (1000 milligrams) at 12 noon.
3. Assume that the amount of Tylenol in your body can be modeled by an exponential
function 
where t is the number of hours from 12 noon.
a. What is the initial value, a, in this situation?
b. Determine the decay factor, b, for the amount of Tylenol in your body.
c. Write an exponential equation for the amount of Tylenol in your body as a function
of t.
Of course, the amount of Tylenol in your body does not decrease suddenly by 24% at the end
of each hour; it is metabolized and eliminated continuously. The equation 
can also
be used to model a quantity that decreases at a continuous rate.
Recall that in Problem 2a, you compared

In 2005, the Avian Flu, also known as Bird Flu, received international attention. Although
there were very few documented cases of the Avian Flu infecting humans worldwide, world
health organizations, including the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, expressed concern
that a mutant strain of the Bird Flu virus that could infect humans via human-to-human con-
tact would develop and produce a worldwide pandemic.
The infection rate (the number of people that any single infected person will infect) and the
incubation period (the time between exposure and the development of symptoms) of this flu
cannot be known precisely but they can be approximated by studying the infection rates and
incubation periods of existing strains of the virus.
A very conservative infection rate would be 1.5 and a reasonable incubation period would
be about 15 days or roughly half of a month. This means that the first infected person could be
expected to infect 1.5 people in about 15 days. After 15 days, that person cannot infect anyone
else. This assumes that the spread of the virus is not checked by inoculation or vaccination.
So the total number of infected people 0.5 month after the first person was infected would be
2.5, the sum of the original infected person and the 1.5 newly infected people. During the sec-
ond half month, the 1.5 newly infected people would infect 
new people.
This means you have 2.25 people to add to the 2.5 people previously infected, or approxi-
mately 5 people infected with Bird Flu at the end of the first month.
1. The following table represents the total number of people who could be infected with a
mutant strain of Bird Flu over a period of 5 months. Complete the table. Round each
value to the nearest whole person.

3. Does the scatterplot indicate a linear relationship between t and T? Explain.
4. a. Use your calculator to model the data with an exponential function. Use option
0:ExpReg in the STAT CALC menu to determine an exponential function that best
fits the given data. Record the regression equation of the exponential model below.
Round a and b to the nearest 0.001. Your screen should appears as follows:
b. Sketch a graph of the exponential model using your calculator and add it to the 
scatterplot in Problem 2.
c. What is the practical domain of this function?
d. What is the y-intercept of the graph? How does it compare to the actual initial value
from the table?
The procedure used to develop the equation of an exponential function that best fits a set of
data is quite different from the least-squares method used to develop a linear regression equa-
tion. Therefore, a correlation coefficient r cannot be calculated for exponential regression
equations. However, some statisticians use a value called the coefficient of multiple deter-
mination, denoted by 
to measure the goodness of fit of an exponential model.
The values of 
vary from 0 to 1. The closer to 1, the better the likelihood an exponential re-
gression equation fits the data. The value of 
is calculated using the graphing calculator and
appears on the same screen as the exponential regression equation.

for the exponential function determined in Problem 4?
Does the value confirm your answer in Problem 3?

Bases for Logarithms
The logarithmic scale for the diameter of spheres situation was labeled with the exponents of
powers of 10. Using 10 as the base for logarithms is common since the number 10 is the base
of our number system. However, other numbers could be used as the base for logs. For exam-
ple, you could use exponents of powers of 5 or exponents of powers of 2.
Example 3
Base-5 logarithms: The log base 5 of a number, x, is the exponent to
which the base, 5, must be raised to obtain x. For example,
a.
or, in words, log base 5 of 5 to the fourth power equals 4
b.
c.
Base-2 logarithms: The log base 2 of a number, x, is the exponent to which 2 must be
raised to obtain x. For example,
a.
or log base 2 of 2 to the fifth power equals 5

Natural Logarithms
Because the base of a log can be any positive number except 1, the base can be the number e.
Many applications involve the use of log base e. Log base e is called the natural log and has
the following special notation:
loge x is written as ln x, read simply as el-n-x.

Logarithmic and Exponential Forms
Because logarithms are exponents, logarithmic statements can be written as exponential
statements, and exponential statements can be written as logarithmic statements.
For example, in the statement 
, the base is 5, the exponent (logarithm) is 3, and
the result is 125. This relationship can also be written as the equation 
.
53 = 125
3 = log5 125
Example 5
Rewrite the exponential equation
as an equivalent
logarithmic equation.
SOLUTION
In the equation 
, the base is e, the result is x, and the exponent (logarithm) is 0.5.
Therefore, the equivalent logarithmic equation is 
, or 0.5 = ln  x.
0.5 = loge x
e0.5 = x
e0.5  x
In general, the logarithmic equation 
is equivalent to the exponential 
equation 
.
b y = x
y = logb x

6. You have recently accepted a job working in the coroner’s office of a large city. Because of the
large numbers of homicides, it has been very difficult for the coroners to complete all of their
work. Your job is, in part, to assist them in the paperwork. On one particular day, you are work-
ing on a case in which you are attempting to establish the time of death.
The coroner tells you that to establish the time of death, he uses the formula
where
t is the number of hours the victim has been dead, 
represents the temperature of the body when discovered, and 
represents the temperature of his surroundings.
The coroner also tells you that the thermostat was set at 68°F in the apartment in which the
body was found and that the victim’s body temperature was 78°F.
a. Using the preceding formula, determine the number of hours the victim has been deceased.
Use your calculator to approximate your answer to one decimal place.

Radioactive Decay
Radioactive substances, such as uranium-235, strontium-90, iodine-131, and carbon-14,
decay continuously with time. If 
represents the original amount of a radioactive substance,
then the amount P present after a time t (usually measured in years) is modeled by

Example 1
One type of uranium decays at a rate of 0.35% per day. If 40 pounds
of this uranium are available today, how much will be available after
90 days?
SOLUTION
The uranium decays at a constant rate of 
per day. The initial amount, the
amount available on the first day, is 40 pounds, so the equation for the amount available after
t days is
To determine the amount available after 90 days, let 
The amount available 90 days
from now is
P = 40e-.00351902 L 29.2 lb.
t = 90.
P = 40e-0.0035t.
0.35% = 0.0035
9. Strontium-90 decays continuously at a constant rate of 2.4% per year. Therefore, the

Definition
Any function defined by an equation of the form

where a, b, and c represent real numbers and 
is called a
quadratic function. The output variable y is defined by an expression having three terms:
the quadratic term, 
the linear term, bx, and the constant term, c. The numerical
factors of the quadratic and linear terms, a and b, are called the coefficients of the terms.

Parabolas are good models for a variety of situations that you encounter in everyday life.
Examples include the path of a golf ball after it is struck, the arch (cable system) of a bridge,
the path of a baseball thrown from the outfield to home plate, the stream of water from a
drinking fountain, and the path of a cliff diver.
Consider the 2008 men’s Olympic shot put event, which was won by Poland’s Tomasz
Majewski with a throw of 70.57 feet. The path of his winning throw can be approximately
modeled by the quadratic function defined by
where x is the horizontal distance in feet from the point of the throw and y is the vertical
height in feet of the shot above the ground.

SUMMARY: ACTIVITY 4.2
The following characteristics are commonly used in analyzing the quadratic function defined by
and its graph.
1. The axis of symmetry is a vertical line that separates the parabola into two mirror images. 
The equation of the vertical axis of symmetry is given by 
2. The vertex (turning point) always falls on the axis of symmetry. The x-coordinate of the vertex
is given by 
Its y-coordinate is determined by evaluating the function at this x-value. 
In other words, the y-coordinate of the vertex is given by 
3. If the parabola changes from increasing to decreasing at the turning point, then the vertex is
a maximum point. If the parabola changes from decreasing to increasing at the turning point,
then the vertex is a minimum point.

4. The vertical intercept, the point where the parabola crosses the y-axis (that is, where its 
x-coordinate is zero), is always given by (0, c).
5. The horizontal intercept is the point or points (if any) where the parabola crosses the x-axis
(that is, where its y-coordinate is zero).
6. If a parabola opens upward and the vertex is above the x-axis, there are no x-intercepts. If a
parabola opens downward and the vertex is below the x-axis, there are no x-intercepts.
7. The domain of a general quadratic function is the set of all real numbers.
8. If the parabola opens upward, the range is all real numbers greater than or equal to the out-
put value of the vertex. If the parabola opens downward, the range is all real numbers less
than or equal to the output value of the vertex.

 y2 = 20,500.
 y1 = 12.6779t2 + 177.3069t + 1,836.8354

For the Zero-Product Property to be applied, one side of the equation must be zero.
Therefore, at first glance, the Zero-Product Property can be used to solve the quadratic equa-
tion 
However, a second condition must be satisfied. The nonzero side of the
equation must be written as a product.
The process of writing an expression such as 
as a product is called factoring.
3x2 - 6x
3x2 - 6x = 0.
Definition
Rewriting an expression as a product is called factoring.
Factoring Common Factors
A common factor is a number or an expression that is a factor of each term of the entire 
expression. Whenever you wish to factor a polynomial, look first for a common factor.
Removing a Common Factor from a Polynomial: First, identify the common factor, and
then apply the distributive property in reverse.
Procedure
Example 2
Given the binomial 
3 is a common factor because 3 is a 
factor of both terms 3x and 6. Applying the distributive property 
in reverse, you write
You may always check the factored binomial by multiplying:
31x + 22 = 31x2 + 3122 = 3x + 6.
3x + 6 as 31x + 22.
3x  6,
When you look for a common factor, determine the largest or greatest common factor (or
GCF). You can see that 3 is a common factor of 
because 3 is a factor of both 6 and
24. However, there is a larger common factor, 6. Therefore,
6x + 24 = 61x + 42.
6x + 24
Example 3
Given 
you can see that 2 is a common factor. 
Is 2 the greatest common factor? Yes, because no larger number 
is a factor of every term.
If you divide each term by 2, you obtain 
The expression 
can now be written in factored form as 
Check the factored trinomial by
multiplying.
213x2 + 7x - 152.
6x2 + 14x - 30
3x2 + 7x - 15.
6x2  14x  30,
Example 4
Factor 
SOLUTION
Four is a factor of each term, but x is as well. Therefore, the greatest common factor is 4x. You
remove the GCF by dividing each term by 4x. This leads to the factored form 
You can check your factoring by applying the distributive property.
4x1x2 - 2x + 72.
4x3  8x2  28x.

On very hot and humid summer days, it is common for the National Weather Service to issue
warnings due to a very high heat index. The heat index is a measurement that combines air
temperature and relative humidity to determine a relative temperature. The heat index is the
temperature you perceive (how it feels) on a hot and humid day. Heat index is similar to
windchill, the temperature you perceive on a cold and windy day. Heat indices are not usu-
ally calculated until the air temperature reaches 80 degrees Fahrenheit.

Problem 2 illustrates that the breakdown with the quadratic formula occurs when you are
asked to evaluate a radical with a negative radicand. If you try to evaluate

2x2 + x + 5 = 0.
2x2 + x + 5 = 0
2x2 + x + 5 = 0.
y = 2x2 + x + 5,
2x2 + x + 5 = 0?
y = 2x2 + x + 5
This tells you there is no real number that is the square root of

This is not a real number. Such a number is a complex number (an extension of the real

In the sixteenth century, complex numbers were first used as solutions to polynomial equa-
tions. The notation 
was used during this time. Such numbers were called imaginary
because their existence was not clearly understood. In 1777, Leonhard Euler introduced the
notation i and wrote complex numbers in the form 
Caspar Wessel in 1797 and Carl
Friedrich Gauss in 1799 used the geometric interpretation of complex numbers as points in 
a plane. This made such numbers more concrete and less mysterious. Finally, in 1833, Sir
William Hamilton showed that if the number i is defined to have the property
then the set of real numbers can be extended to include numbers like 
Today, complex numbers are used in a variety of applications, including chaos theory
(fractals) and engineering.

Discriminant
In the complex number system, every quadratic equation has at least one solution. In the
quadratic formula
the expression 
is called the discriminant because its value determines the number
and type of solutions of a quadratic equation 
There are three possible
cases, depending on whether the value of the discriminant is positive, zero, or negative.
Problems 5, 6, and 7 investigate this relationship.
5. For each of the following quadratic functions, determine the sign of the discriminant.
Then sketch a graph using your graphing calculator, and determine the number of 
x-intercepts.

Recall that the real solutions to the equation 
and the x-intercepts of the
graph of 
are the same. Since the graph of

But the quadratic equation 
does have exactly two solutions in the complex
number system. The two solutions must be complex and not real. Similarly, if the graph of a
quadratic function has two x-intercepts, the solutions to the equation 
must
be two real numbers.

As the input values (units of time) increase, the corresponding output values (units of dis-

Because 
you can say that the output, s, varies directly as the square of the input, t.
Therefore, as t doubles in value from 1 to 2 or from 2 to 4, the corresponding output values
become 4 times as large: increasing from 16 to 64 or 64 to 256.

Definition
Functions defined by equations of the form 
where k is a nonzero constant and 
n is a positive integer, belong to the family of functions called rational functions.
The rational functions of the form 
are also called inverse variation functions.
The number k is called the constant of variation or constant of proportionality.

You are a buyer for a national chain of retail stores. You purchase merchandise at a wholesale
cost. The merchandise is then sold at a retail price (called the selling price). The retailer’s
markup is the difference between the selling price (what the consumer pays) and the whole-
sale cost.

the points in plots. If the window is such that the calculator does not try to plot a point at
then it may connect a point for an x-value slightly less than 1 to one slightly greater
than 1. This creates the appearance of an asymptote. To avoid this, change the mode to dot
mode, as follows:
x = 1,
1x = 12

The first recorded successful parachute jump was made from a hot air balloon in 1797.
Parachute technology and equipment were significantly refined by the use of parachutes in
the military. Modern parachuting, also known as skydiving, has developed into a popular and
exciting recreational activity and competitive sport.
Typically, individuals jump out of an aircraft at approximately 14,000 feet and free-fall for a
period of time before activating a parachute. When first exiting the aircraft, a skydiver will
have a slight feeling of falling. However, during their period of free-fall, skydivers generally
do not experience a “falling” sensation because the resistance of the air to their body provides
some feeling of weight and direction.
The distance, s (in feet), that a skydiver travels in free-fall is a function of time, t (in seconds).
This function is defined by 
Note: This model neglects air resistance.

A skydiver needs to know how much time she has in free-fall before having to activate the
parachute. The free-fall time will depend on the distance in free-fall.
2. a. Suppose the skydiver jumps from a plane at 12,000 feet and has to activate the para-
chute at 3000 feet. Determine the free-fall distance.
b. Use the formula 
to determine how much time she will have in free-fall.
s = 16t 2

13. It is not unreasonable to imagine that someday travel in space will be a common occur-
rence. According to Einstein’s theory of relativity, time would pass more quickly on
Earth than it would for someone who is traveling in a spacecraft at a velocity close to
the speed of light. As a result, a person on Earth would age more rapidly than a space
traveler. The formula
models the relationship between the aging rate, A, of an astronaut and the aging rate, F,
of a person on Earth. The variable v represents the astronaut’s velocity in miles per sec-
ond, and c represents the speed of light (approximately 186,000 miles per second).

l (in feet), of the skid marks. The f in the formula represents the road condition at 
the time of the accident.
a. On dry pavement the f-value is 0.85. Write a function equation for speed, s, as a
function of the length of the skid marks, l, on dry pavement.
b. Estimate the speed of a car if the skid marks on dry pavement are 90 feet long.
c. What is the practical domain for the function in part a?
d. Graph this function using your graphing calculator.
e. Use the graph to determine the length of the skid marks on dry pavement if the car
was traveling at 70 miles per hour when the brakes were applied.

Solving Equations Involving Radical Expressions
Suppose you are interested in determining the value of d for many different values of t. 
In such a situation, the process could be simplified if you had a rule for d as a function of t. 
The equation 
gives t as a function of d. You need to solve this equation for d.
t = 2d

Definition
An equation in which at least one side contains a radical with a variable in the radicand
is called a radical equation.

If a and b are two quantities such that 
then 
where n is a positive integer.
an = bn,
a = b,
Solving an equation algebraically when the variable appears under a radical involves using
the following property of equations.

Introducing the Sine, Cosine, and Tangent Functions
During a trip to Italy, you visit a wonder of the world, the Leaning Tower of Pisa. Your guide-
book explains that the tower now makes an 85-degree angle with the ground and measures
179 feet in length. If you drop a stone straight down from the top of the tower, how far from
the base will it land?
To answer this question accurately, you need a branch of mathematics called trigonometry.
Although the development of trigonometry is generally credited to the ancient Greeks, there
is evidence that the ancient Egyptian cultures used trigonometry in constructing the
pyramids.
Right Triangles
As you will see, the accurate answer to the Leaning Tower question requires some knowl-
edge of right triangles. Consider the following right triangle with angles A, B, and C and
sides a, b, and c.

Definition
Angle C is the right angle, the angle measuring 90°. The side opposite the right angle, 
c, is called the hypotenuse. Side a is said to be opposite angle A because it is not part 
of angle A. Side b is said to be adjacent to angle A because it and the hypotenuse form
angle A. Similarly, side b is the side opposite angle B, and side a is the side adjacent 
to angle B. The sides a and b are called legs.
Note that in any right triangle, the lengths of the sides are related by the Pythagorean
theorem.
In words, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two
sides.

Sine, Cosine, and Tangent Functions
As indicated in Problem 4, the ratios of the sides of a right triangle are dependent on the size of
the angle A. If the angle changes, the ratios change. This fact is fundamental to trigonometry.
The ratios of the sides of a right triangle with acute angle A are a function of the size of A.
The ratios are given special names and are defined as follows.
Definition
Let A be an acute angle (less than 
) of a right triangle. The sine, cosine, and tangent
of angle A are defined by
where sin, cos, and tan are the standard abbreviations for sine, cosine, and tangent,
respectively.
•
Sine, cosine, and tangent are called trigonometric functions.
•
Note that the input values for the trigonometric functions are angles and the output
values are ratios.
•
A mnemonic device often used to help remember the trigonometric relationships is
SOH CAH TOA, where SOH indicates that the sine function is the length of the side
opposite divided by the length of the hypotenuse, CAH indicates the cosine
definition, and TOA indicates the definition of the tangent function.
 tangent of A = tan A =
length of the side opposite A
length of the side adjacent to A,

1. The trigonometric functions are functions whose inputs are measures of the acute angles of a
right triangle and whose outputs are ratios of the lengths of the sides of the right triangle.
2. The three sides of a right triangle are the adjacent side, the opposite side, and the
hypotenuse. The hypotenuse is always the side opposite the right 
angle. The other
two sides vary, depending on which angle is used as the input.

You and some friends take a trip to Colton Point State Park in the Grand Canyon of Pennsylvania.
Some of your group go white-water rafting, while some of your friends join you for a hike. 
You reach the observation deck in time to see the rest of your party battling the white water.
Someone in the group asks you how close you think the rafts actually get to you as they float
by. You have no idea, but you ask a nearby park ranger.
She doesn’t know either, but she does tell you that the canyon is approximately 800 feet deep at
Colton Point and that the angle of depression to the creek is about 22°.
a. Draw a diagram of this situation.
b. Use trigonometry to estimate how close the rafters get to you on the observation deck.

Situation 1: Stabilizing a Tower
You are considering buying property near a cell phone tower and are concerned about your
property values. You decide to do some reading about issues involving towers, such as aes-
thetics, safety, and stability. Of course, anyone living near the tower would like a guarantee
that it could not blow down. Guy wires are part of that guarantee.

The tower rises 300 feet and is supported by several pairs of guy wires all attached on the
ground at the same distance from the base of the tower. In each pair, one guy wire extends
from the ground to the top of the tower, and the other attaches halfway up. The accompany-
ing diagram illustrates one pair of wires.
1. New guidelines for stability recommend that the angle (A) the guy wires make with the
line through the center of the tower (not the angle of elevation) must be at least 40°.
Therefore, the existing guy wires may need to be replaced. Because you are concerned
about how close the wires will come to your property, you need to compute the shortest
distance from the tower at which the guy wires may be attached. Use trigonometry to
compute this distance.
2. To improve stability, the authors of the guidelines propose increasing the minimum
angle the guy wire makes with the tower from 40° to 50°. What is the effect on the short-
est distance from the tower at which the guy wires may be attached?
Situation 2: Climbing a Mountain
You are camping in the Adirondacks and decide to climb a mountain that dominates the local
area. You are curious about the vertical rise of the mountain and recall from your mathemat-
ics course that surveyors can measure the angle of elevation of a mountain summit with a
theodolite. You are able to borrow a theodolite from the local community college to gather
some pertinent data. You find a level field and take a first reading of an angle of elevation of
23°. Then you walk 100 feet toward the mountain summit and take a second reading of 
24° angle of elevation (see accompanying illustration).

Why Are the Trigonometric Functions Called 
Circular Functions?
You are piloting a small plane and want to land at the local airport. Due to an emergency on
the ground, the air traffic controller places you in a circular holding pattern at a constant alti-
tude with a radius of 1 mile. Because your fuel is low, you are concerned with the distance
traveled in the holding pattern. Of course, you communicate with air traffic control about
your coordinates so that you do not collide with another airplane.
The given diagram shows your path in the air. The airport is located at the center 10, 02 of the
circle on the ground. The radius of the circle is 1 mile. A circle centered at 10, 02 and having
radius 1 is called a unit circle. You begin your holding pattern at 11, 02.

Household electric current is called alternating current, or AC, because it changes magnitude
and direction with time. The household current through a 60-watt lightbulb is given by the
equation
where A is the current in amperes and t is time in seconds.
Note that the input of the sine function in this activity is time measured by real numbers (sec-
onds) and not angles measured in degrees. In order for this to make sense, an alternate real-
number method for measuring angles must be introduced. This method is called radian
measure.
A = 2 sin1120pt2,
Example 1
Dividing each side of the equality 
radians by 2 shows that 
90 degrees is the same as 
radians. You can also convert 90 degrees
to radians by multiplying 1° by 90.
Similarly,

10° = 10 # p

Property 1:
If you are multiplying two powers of the same base, keep 
the base the same and add the exponents.
Example 1:
Note that the exponents were added and the base did not change.
Property 2:
If you are dividing two powers of the same base, keep the 
base the same and subtract the exponents.
Example 2:
Note that the exponents were subtracted and the base did not change.
Property 3:
If an exponent is applied to a power, multiply the exponents.
Example 3:
The exponents were multiplied. The base did not change.
Property 4:
If an exponent is applied to a product, the exponent is
distributed to each factor.
Example 4:
Note that since the base contained three factors, each of those was raised to the third power.
The common mistake in an expansion such as this is not to raise the coefficient to the power.

Concept Review
Property 5:
Often presented as a definition, Property 5 states that any
nonzero base raised to the zero power is 1. This property or definition is a result of Property 2
of exponents as follows.
Consider 
Using Property 2, 
However, you know that any fraction in which the
numerator and the denominator are equal is equivalent to 1. Therefore, 
Example 5:
Given a nonzero base, if the exponent is 0, the value is 1.
Property 6:
Sometimes presented as a definition, Property 6 states that
any base 
raised to a negative power is equivalent to the reciprocal of the base raised to the positive
power. Note that the negative exponent does not have any effect on the sign of the base. This
property could also be viewed as a result of the second property of exponents as follows.
Consider 
Using Property 2, 
If you view this expression algebraically, you
have three factors of x in the numerator and five in the denominator. If you divide out the
three common factors, you are left with 
Therefore, if Property 2 is true, then

Trigonometric Functions for More General Angles
When an angle is larger than 90° (in radians, 
), you can still evaluate sine, cosine,
and tangent. You work in an xy plane, make the positive x-axis the initial side of the angle, and
make a reference triangle by dropping a perpendicular to the x-axis from a point on the terminal
side of the angle. (See the figure below.) For positive angles, you rotate counterclockwise to
find the terminal side.

You then use SOH CAH TOA on the reference triangle. Warning: The adjacent and oppo-
site sides may be negative in this situation, depending on the quadrant in which the terminal
side of the angle lies.
For example, in the figure shown, note the negative sign for the adjacent side. (It lies on the
negative x-axis.) You have
Note: The hypotenuse is ALWAYS positive.
You also need to use the Pythagorean theorem at times. In the next figure, you have
Since y must be negative (do you see why?), 
You now find
As noted previously, reference triangles with angles of
30°, 60°, or 45° show up frequently because of the sym-
metry involved. To find the values of the three trigono-
metric functions for

degrees and sketch the angle and the reference triangle.

For simplicity, notice that for ordinary angles, when we mark a point on the terminal side of

The Intersection Method
This method is based on the fact that solutions to the equation 
are input values of
x that produce the same output for the functions f and g. Graphically, these are the x-coordinates
of the intersection points of

Number of Years Since 2000
U.S. internet Users (in millions)
c. The slope of the line is 8.66, indicating that for each
year after 2000, the number of Internet users increased by
approximately 8.66 million. d. According to the model,
the number of Internet users in the United States will reach
200 million in 2009. I am somewhat confident of this pre-
diction because the graph of the data from 1996 to 2002 in-
dicates that the relationship has been very linear and 2009
is only four years from the latest data shown.
