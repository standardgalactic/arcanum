Non-Wellfounded Mereology
Abstract
This paper is a systematic exploration of non-wellfounded mereology. Motiva-
tions and applications suggested in the literature are considered. Some are exotic
like Borges’ Aleph, and the Trinity; other examples are less so, like time trav-
eling bricks, and even Geach’s Tibbles the Cat. The authors point out that the
transitivity of non-wellfounded parthood is inconsistent with extensionality. A
non-wellfounded mereology is developed with careful consideration paid to ri-
val notions of supplementation and fusion. Two equivalent axiomatizations are
given, and are compared to classical mereology. We provide a class of models with
respect to which the non-wellfounded mereology is sound and complete.
This paper explores the prospects of non-wellfounded mereology. An order < (in
this case proper parthood) on a domain is said to be wellfounded if every non-empty sub-
set of that domain has a <-minimal element. We say that x is a <-minimal element of
a set S if there is no y in S such that y < x. Wellfoundedness rules out any inﬁnite de-
scending <-chains. There are atomless mereologies, sometimes called gunky, in which
proper parthood chains are all inﬁnite.This is one interesting and important case of
a non-wellfounded mereology. But notice, wellfoundedness also rules out structures
in which for some x, x < x; likewise, it rules out cases in which there is some x and
y such that x < y and y < x. That is, wellfoundedness rules out parthood loops. In
See Tarski [] for one formalization. Some philosophers have argued that gunk is metaphysically
possible, for example Sider [] and Zimmerman [].


this paper, we explore a non-wellfounded mereology that allows for both these sorts
of parthood loops.
In §, we brieﬂy survey some applications for non-wellfounded mereology that
have been suggested in the literature. In §, we consider diﬃculties with the classi-
cal deﬁnitions of parthood and proper parthood; we discuss extensionality principles in
mereology, and argue that extensionality is inconsistent with the transitivity of part-
hood in certain non-wellfounded scenarios. In §, we examine supplementation prin-
ciples and rival notions of fusion for non-wellfounded mereology. §examines the
relationship between classical mereology and non-wellfounded mereology. We show
that the latter is a simple generalization of the former. Finally, we give a class of mod-
els for which non-wellfounded mereology is sound and complete in §.

Why?
Why would one consider a mereology according to which there could be proper part-
hood loops? After all, there appears to be a consensus that it is a conceptual truth that
parthood is a partial order. Simons [] writes,
The most obvious formal properties of the [proper] part-relation are its
transitivity and asymmetry, from which follows its irreﬂexivity. [. . . ] These
principles are partly constitutive of the meaning of ‘part’, which means
that anyone who seriously disagrees with them has failed to understand
the word. (–)
Simons’ view has been inﬂuential; however, there have been dissenters. In this sec-
tion, we will brieﬂy survey some cases purported to be examples of non-wellfounded
objects.

.
Exotica
We begin with some of the more exotic cases. David Sanford [] contends that the
na¨ıve notion of parthood does not require antisymmetry. Sanford cites Borges’ ‘Aleph’
as an example: “I saw the Aleph from all points. I saw the earth in the Aleph and in
the earth the Aleph once more and the earth in the Aleph [. . . ]”. As Sandford notes,
the Aleph is intended to have everything as a part, including the earth. But apparently
the Aleph is a proper part of the earth, given the fact that it is sitting on the stairs in
Beatriz Viterbo’s house. van Inwagen [] has responded that ﬁctional examples of this
sort do not constitute counterevidence to conceptual truths. While Borges may have
been knowingly and intentionally writing ﬁction, other authors have given examples
in texts that were not intended as ﬁction. These examples, however, are no less bizarre.
Strikingly similar to Borges’ example, is an interesting passage in the Upanishads []
that outlines the structural relations between Brahman and a ‘space’ in the heart.
In the center of the castle of Brahman, our own body, there is a small shrine
in the form of a lotus-ﬂower, and within can be found a small space. [. . . ]
This little space within the heart is as great as this vast universe. The heav-
ens and earth are there, and the sun, and the moon, and the stars; ﬁre and
lightning and winds are there; and all that now is and all that is not; for
the whole universe is in Him and He dwells within our heart. ()
Of course, many philosophers would regard such a structure as metaphysically impos-
sible, but it seems an additional question as to whether it is conceptually impossible.
Again, consider another traditional religious doctrine: the Trinity. Peter Abelard []
argues that while each person of the Trinity is a part of God, each person of the Trin-
ity is also identical with God, by virtue of having the same essence. Is the Trinity on
Abelard’s understanding conceptually impossible? Perhaps, but this is not obvious.
In any case, given the extraordinary nature of the purported counterexamples, we


do not expect many to be convinced. So let us turn now to less exotic, more ordinary
examples of parthood loops.
.
Puzzles of Composition
A standard puzzle of composition concerns a lump of clay that is formed into a statue.
One might think it plausible that, although the lump and the statue are not identical,
they are completely colocated and ‘made up of’ exactly the same matter. It is thus
highly intuitive to think that they have exactly the same atomic parts. However given
a standard mereological ‘supplementation’ principle, that anything the statue is not
a part of is disjoint from some part of the statue, one can infer that the statue is a
part of the lump of clay; and by symmetrical reasoning that the lump of clay is a part
of the statue. Thus the clay and the statue are parts of each other. But since we are
supposing that they are not identical, they must be distinct mutual proper parts. In
fact, philosophers have defended similar positions.Judith Thomson suggests that
the statue is constituted by the clay, and that constitution requires mutual parthood:
“x constitutes y at t only if x is part of y at t and y is part of x at t” ([], ). But
constitution, Thomson thinks, does not imply identity.
Another classical puzzle of composition concerns Tibbles the cat.Tibbles is a cat
who has a tail at some time t1 and loses it at t2. Call Tibbles’ tail ‘Tail’; and call the
part of Tibbles without his tail ‘Tib’.
Tib is smaller than Tibbles so they are not identical. But what if we now
amputate the cat’s tail? Tibbles and Tib will now coincide. If Tibbles is still
a cat, it is hard to see by what criterion one could deny that Tib is a cat.
[. . . ] But there is just one cat on the mat. So [Tibbles and Tib] cannot be
See [XXXXX] for a wellfounded explanation of mutual parthood.



distinct cats. They must be the same cat. ([])
The literature is ﬁlled with many diﬀerent responses to this puzzle.Given that Tib-
bles and Tib have the same proper parts after the amputation it is very natural to
infer that they are mutual parts.Tib might be a proper part of Tibbles before the
amputation, but Tibbles and Tib are mutual parts afterwards.
If a non-wellfounded mereology was formally viable, then there are other unex-
plored responses. One could hold that Tib is a proper part of Tibbles and also that Tib
is identical to Tibbles even before amputation. Indeed, Peter Abelard [] appeared to
have held such a view.
[W]hen a hand has been cut oﬀ, that which then stays a human was also
staying a human before the amputation, although it was hidden as a part
in the human who was the whole. [. . . ] Therefore, although before all am-
putations there were many parts in one human each of which was human,
still there were not for this reason many humans. [. . . ] For the humans
here have the same essence. ()
There may be drawbacks to such approaches; however, these considerations should be
weighed against the drawbacks of competing theories.
For a good selection, see Rea’s collection [].
Here one must also appeal to the principle ‘Strong Supplementation’ – see NWSin §.
This view is exactly analogous to his views on the Trinity; indeed, his views on both occur in the
same passage.
For example, see Eagle [], (especially §), for suggestions of general ways in which the apparently
distinguishing characteristics of Tib and Tibbles may be explained away.

.
Mereology & Time Travel
There is a growing literature surrounding the topic of mereology and time travel.
Time travel scenarios have been proposed as counterexamples to certain mereological
principles, many of which imply that proper parthood is non-wellfounded.
For instance, consider Eﬃngham []:
Imagine a cube, with each side measuring 10m, made of a homogeneous
substance. Not only do we take it back to a time that it previously existed
at, but we use a shrinking machine and miniaturize by a factor of 100.
We then remove a cube-shaped portion, with edges measuring 10cm, from
the earlier, larger version of the cube and replace that portion with the
miniaturized future version (which now ﬁts perfectly). The cube is now a
proper part of itself at that time.
Although it is not obvious how such uses of ‘proper part’ are to be interpreted (as
will be discussed in §), if such time travel stories are to be accepted as legitimate
metaphysical possibilities, then one would assume a non-wellfounded mereology is
required to model them.
.
Other Examples
There are other examples of non-wellfounded relations bearing similarities to the
parthood relation in the literature. For instance, Kearns [] argues that Russellian
propositions have mereological parts and that such a mereology must thus be non-
wellfounded to account for propositions like the following:
P is abstract.
At the time of writing, the literature includes Cody Gilmore’s argument against perdurantism in
[], Antony Eagle’s response [], and Gilmore’s reply []. Independently, Nikk Eﬃngham and Jon
Robson have used similar cases to argue against endurantism in [], Donald Smith’s response [], and
Eﬃngham’s reply [].


Here P is the proposition expressed by the above sentence (assuming a proposition is
expressed). Indeed, the existence of such propositions is a central component to the
solution of the liar paradox defended by Barwise and Etchemendy in []. It should
be noted that this potential application appears to rely on a presupposed relationship
between the constituents of a proposition and the parts of a proposition. We have
reservations about the similarities between these notions, and so are unsure that the
non-wellfounded mereology advanced below has application here.
Another example can be drawn from the metaphysics of sets. Lewis [] has ar-
gued that sets themselves may have non-trivial mereological properties. Although
not the Lewisian view, if a set’s members are among its parts, then one must coun-
tenance a non-wellfounded mereology to account for the mereological properties of
non-wellfounded sets. Achille Varzi [] suggests this application, and concludes,
In view of certain developments in non-wellfounded set theory [. . . ], one
might indeed suggest building mereology on the basis of an equally less
restrictive notion of parthood that allows for closed loops. This is particu-
larly signiﬁcant in view of the possibility of reformulating set theory itself
in mereological terms [. . . ]. Thus, in this case there is legitimate concern
that one of the obvious meaning postulates for ‘part’ is in fact too restric-
tive. At present, however, no systematic study of non-wellfounded mere-
ology has been put forward in the literature.
The relationship between set membership and parthood Varzi is suggesting is contro-
versial. However, before we can even begin a systematic investigation of these issues
we need to develop a theory of parthood that allows for non-wellfoundedness. But
given that no study of non-wellfounded mereology has been undertaken, this paper is
In fact, the authors have conﬂicting opinions. One of us [XXXXX] believes the relation that holds
between a Russellian proposition and its constituents is not parthood, and hence rejects that the appli-
cation can be made. The other [XXXXX] has no settled view, and leaves the possibility of application
open.


an attempt to ﬁll that gap. So, we move from potential applications of the theory to
the theory itself.

Primitives and Definitions
What we want, then, is a mereology of objects that may be proper parts of each other,
and objects that may be proper parts of themselves. According to classical mereology,
parthood is taken to be primitive and is a partial order.
MAReﬂexivity: x ≤x
MAAntisymmetry: (x ≤y ∧y ≤x) →x = y
MATransitivity: (x ≤y ∧y ≤z) →x ≤z
We then go on to deﬁne proper parthood in one of two ways:
PPx < y B (x ≤y) ∧(x , y)
PPx < y B (x ≤y) ∧(y ≰x).
These axioms ensure that proper parthood does not allow for proper parthood loops.
More speciﬁcally, assuming MA, PPand PPare equivalent. But PPrules out any
cases where x < x. And PPrules out any cases where x < y and y < x. In eﬀect, proper
parthood is a strict order, with no parthood loops.
One option is simply to reject the antisymmetry axiom (MA), and stipulate that
parthood is merely a preorder.So, PPand PPare no longer logically equivalent.
In fact, in the absence of antisymmetry, it is consistent with PPfor there to be cases
where x < y and y < x. However, PPstill rules out cases where x < x by deﬁnition.
The relation deﬁned by PPis thus non-transitive. On the other hand, PPrules out
This is the strategy employed in [XXXXX].


both cases where x < x and cases where x < y and y < x. If we want to model both
cases, we need diﬀerent axioms and deﬁnitions.
One easy way to construct a non-wellfounded mereology of the desired sort would
be to start with a primitive proper parthood relation < and require only that it be
transitive.
NWATransitivity: (x < y ∧y < z) →x < z
NWAallows for proper parthood loops in both of the desired ways: we will have
cases where x < x and cases where x < y while y < x. We can then introduce deﬁnitions
of overlap and parthood in the usual fashion
P x ≤y B x < y ∨x = y
O x ◦y B ∃z(z ≤x ∧z ≤y)
Parthood according to P is reﬂexive. Moreover, ≤inherits transitivity from the transi-
tivity of < and =. However, we shall see that ≤is not in general antisymmetric.
One might wonder what conditions suﬃce for two composite objects to be identi-
cal. Here are some natural candidates:
x ≤y ∧y ≤x
∀z(z < x ↔z < y)
∀z(z ◦x ↔z ◦y)
In classical mereology, each of these conditions suﬃce for the identity of x and y.
These conditions correspond to three so-called extensionality principles.
EP Extensionality of Parts: (x ≤y ∧y ≤x) →x = y
EPP Extensionality of Proper Parts: (Co(x) ∨Co(y)) →(∀z(z < x ↔z < y) →x = y)


EO Extensionality of Overlap: ∀z(z ◦x ↔z ◦y) →x = y
Notice that EP is just the antisymmetry principle (MA). In EPP, we say an object x
is composite if it has a proper part; this is expressed via a predicate Co(x) B ∃y(y < x).
The reason we require that EPP be restricted only to composite objects is to allow
for more than one atom.In EO, it is claimed that any two objects with the same
overlappers are identical.
Given the transitivity of < and the presence of distinct mutual parts, we cannot
consistently have any of the above extensionality principles. For EP, consider two
distinct but mutual proper parts a and b. Since a < b, b < a, and a , b, we have a ≤b
and b ≤a without a and b being identical. Thus ≤is not antisymmetric; EP fails. For
EPP and EO, consider a and b again. By transitivity (NWA), we have a < a and b < b.
Moreover, transitivity guarantees that any proper part of a is a proper part of b, and
vice versa.

This means that no matter what proper parts a and b have, mutual parthood and
transitivity force every part of one to be part of the other. But since a and b have proper
parts, they are not atoms; hence, by EPP, a = b. But this contradicts our supposition
that a , b. By similar reasoning one can see that a and b have the same overlappers. If
we had EO, we could once again infer that a = b, contradicting the supposition that a
and b are distinct but mutual parts. In eﬀect, transitivity plus extensionality rules out
parthood loops.
The same restriction is required on the extensionality principle in set theory with urelements.

Axioms for Non-wellfounded Mereology
In this section, we will explore various supplementation principles and fusion prin-
ciples for non-wellfounded mereology. We argue that fusions are best understood in
one of two ways depending on which supplementation axiom is accepted. In neither
case are fusions unique.
.
Decomposition
Supplementation principles in mereology are designed to satisfy the intuition that if
an object has one proper part, it must have another. Simons [] considers a number
of such principles, as does Varzi []; so, we will follow their lead.
First, consider the straightforward intuition:
NWSWeak Company: x < y →∃z(z < y ∧z , x).
NWSstates that if an object has a proper part, then it has another distinct proper
part. This supplementation principle, of course rules out any object a such that a < a
and a has no other proper parts.
a
%
But this is arguably the most basic case of a non-wellfounded object (sometimes called
a ‘Quine atom’).And so NWSwill not do.
Consider another candidate supplementation principle.
NWSStrong Company: x < y →∃z(z < y ∧z ≰x).
Of course, NWSis strictly stronger than NWS, and so inherits all its problems. But
it is worth seeing that NWSrules out all cases of mutual parthood. For if a < b and
b < a, then by transitivity, we have it that a < a and b < b. Moreover, any z that is part



of a will be part of b, and vice versa. But then there can be no part of a that is not a
part of b; there can be no witness for z in NWS. Thus all models like the one below
are ruled out.

@        But this, like extensionality, ruins the whole motive for non-wellfounded parthood.
Most mereologists have accepted the next principle;some have gone so far as to
claim that it is constitutive of the concept of parthood.
NWSWeak Supplementation: x < y →∃z(z ≤y ∧¬z ◦x)
But NWSis also inconsistent with any proper parthood relation that is not irreﬂexive
and asymmetric. Unlike NWS, NWSrules out any reﬂexive proper parthood struc-
ture at all, even if that object has other proper parts. Assume a < a. Assume also that
there are b and c s.t. b < a and c < a.

There is still no z ≤a such that ¬z ◦a, simply by deﬁnition.
There is, however, a principle which is seemingly stronger than NWSwhich is
consistent with non-wellfoundedness in this setting.
NWSStrong Supplementation: y ≰x →∃z(z ≤y ∧¬z ◦x)
Given MA–MAand PPor PP, NWSimplies NWS. However, that proof relies
on the antisymmetry of ≤, which fails here. Notice, the antecedent in the supplemen-
tation principle is y ≰x, which implies that y ≮x and y , x. This is actually a weaker

constraint than x < y, the antecedent in NWS–NWS. NWSdoes not rule out all
reﬂexive parts, nor does it rule out all mutual parthood structures. It does, however,
rule out certain models, like the following.
a

In this case, we have a reﬂexive part a with only one other proper part b. But a ≰b and
there is no part of a that does not overlap b. If the above model included c < a but c ≮b
and b ≮c (viz. the countermodel to NWS), it would be a model of NWS. In fact, this
principle does seem to restrict our models to the sorts we would like, by requiring a
‘remainder’.
In in the presence of antisymmetry, NWSimplies the extensionality of overlap
(EO) and proper parthood (EPP).However, as we shall see in §., in the non-
wellfounded setting NWSdoes not imply any extensionality principles. The follow-
ing non-extensional model satisﬁes NWS.

Because NWScaptures the ‘remainder’ intuition while still being consistent with
non-wellfounded objects like Quine atoms and mutual proper parts, there is good
prima facie reason to accept it as an axiom. It may seem a bit surprising that the
axiom that guarantees extensionality in the classical setting is consistent with non-
extensional non-wellfounded mereology. However, that derivation relies crucially on

mereology. See Simons [] pp. –, and Casati and Varzi [] p. .

the antisymmetry of ≤, which fails here.
There is another candidate for supplementation that is worth considering.
NWSComplementation: y ≰x →∃z∀w(w ≤z ↔(w ≤y ∧¬w ◦x))
This principle is a lot like NWS, with the exception that instead of stipulating the
existence of some non-x-overlapping remainder of y, it stipulates the existence of a
remainder of y that consists of (or is composed of) all and only the parts of y disjoint
from x. Built in to NWSis a principle regarding composition. Consider the following

In this case, a and b are mutual parts who share c,d,e as proper parts. The question
here is this: must c and e have an upper bound z which does not have d as a part?
NWSdoes not require this, while NWSdoes. If there is no such z, then this model
is ruled out by complementation. Varzi [] rightly suggests that NWSbleeds into
principles regarding composition:
As it turns out, the extra strength of [NWS] is therefore best appreciated
in terms of the sort of mereological aggregates that this principle would
force us to accept, aggregates that are composed of two or more parts of a
given whole. This suggests that any additional misgivings about [NWS]
[. . . ] are truly misgivings about matters of composition.
Thus, we will withhold judgment on NWSuntil we examine various fusion axioms.


.
Composition
What sort of fusions are appropriate to a non-wellfounded mereology? We begin with
three candidate deﬁnitions of fusion. Here, we say that t is a fusion of the φ’s, where
φ is any predicate without t free and t is a term.
FFu1(t,φ) B ∀y(y ◦t ↔∃x(φ ∧y ◦x))
FFu2(t,φ) B ∀x(φ →x ≤t) ∧∀y(y ≤t →∃x(φ ∧y ◦x))
FFu3(t,φ) B ∀x(φ →x ≤t) ∧∀y∀x((φ →x ≤y) →t ≤y)
Fsays that t is the fusion of the φs when t overlaps exactly those things that overlap
a φ. Fsays that t is the fusion of the φs when any φ is part of t and any part of t
overlaps some φ. Fsays that t is the fusion of the φs when t has all the φs as parts
and t is part of any other y that has all the φs as parts. NWFis usually thought
of as deﬁning the notion of a least upper bound. However, since we do not have the
antisymmetry of ≤, it really only expresses the notion of minimal upper bounds.
Corresponding to each type of fusion, there are axiom schemes which assert the
existence of each type of fusion for every formula φ without z free.
NWE∃xφ →∃zFu1(z,φ)
NWE∃xφ →∃zFu2(z,φ)
NWE∃xφ →∃zFu3(z,φ)
All three deﬁnitions of fusion (NWF– NWF) are equivalent in the context of any
axiomatization that yields classical mereology. Which fusion existence axiom (NWE
These deﬁnitions of fusions largely follow those discussed in Hovda [], where there he calls them
‘Type-’, ‘Type-’, and ‘Mub’ respectively. They also correspond to the deﬁnitions of fusion in Varzi [],
where he calls their corresponding existence axioms ‘Strong Sum’, ‘Strong Sumb’, and ‘Strong Suma’
respectively.

– NWE) yields classical mereology depends on the choice of other axioms. In non-
classical mereologies, the deﬁnitions of fusion are often not equivalent. In the pres-
ence of transitivity (NWA) only, we can prove that ∀z(Fu2(z,φ) →Fu1(z,φ)), but not
vice versa. So, in one way, NWEis stronger than NWE. The following model vali-
dates NWAand NWEbut not NWE:

Do a and b have a fusion? It might appear not. There is no object ‘made up’ of a and b
together. However, it turns out that a is a fusion (in the sense deﬁned by Fu1) of a and
b. Let the extension of φ here be just a and b. Note that every object overlaps a if and
only if it overlaps b. Hence, every object overlaps a if and only if there’s some φ that it
overlaps. Moreover, b is also a fusion1 of a and b.On the other hand, a and b do not
have a fusion2 in this model since there is nothing of which both a and b are a part,
preventing the ﬁrst conjunct of NWFbeing satisﬁed.
It should be noted, however, that in the presence of strong supplementation (NWS)
and transitivity (NWA) these two notions of fusion are equivalent. Firstly, we note
that the principle ∀z(z ◦y →z ◦x) →y ≤x is a straightforward consequence of NWS.
Suppose, now, that x is a fusion1 of the φs so that (*): ∀y(x ◦y ↔∃z(φ(z) ∧z ◦y)). We
then want to show x is a fusion2 of the φs – i.e. we want to show () that ∀y(φ(y) →
y ≤x) and () that y ≤x →∃z(φ(z) ∧z ◦y). () is immediate from (*). For () suppose
that φ(y) and let z ◦y. Since z overlaps a φ it follows, by (*), that z overlaps x, z ◦x. By
the principle ∀z(z ◦y →z ◦x) →y ≤x, we have shown that y ≤x as required for ().
This point was ﬁrst made by Hovda [].

According to Fu2, neither a nor b count as a fusion of c and e. And this model will
be ruled out by NWE, since there is no fusion for c and e. Intuitively, it does seem
as though the model is missing something. It appears that you can simply fuse to-
gether c and e to get all of a (or b for that matter) including d, even though neither c
nor e overlap with d. And that seems to be problematic with our intuitive notion of
mereological sum.
This is precisely the reason that minimal upper bounds, as deﬁned by Fu3, are
problematic.For according to Fu3, a (and for that matter b) does count as a fusion
of c and e, even though a has a completely unrelated part, d. There are some who are
attracted to this notion of fusion.However, Varzi [] argues against such a notion
of fusion:
All this is hard to swallow. No matter how exactly one deﬁnes the word,
surely a fusion is supposed to be entirely composed of the things it fuses.
We think that Varzi is right, but that this criticism only applies in contexts where
complementation (NWS) fails. Recall that the complementation axiom rules out such
models and requires the existence of an upper bound of c and e that does not have d
as a part. So, there is reason to think that NWEis an adequate fusion axiom scheme
only when paired with NWS.

As mentioned above, Fu3 is usually associated with least upper bounds, a standard
algebraic notion of fusion. However, without antisymmetry, we do not have least upper
bounds because we do not, in general, have the uniqueness of fusions. In fact, on
neither F, F, nor Fdo we have the uniqueness of fusions.
UF(Fu1(x,φ) ∧Fu1(y,φ)) →(x = y)
UF(Fu2(x,φ) ∧Fu2(y,φ)) →(x = y)
UF(Fu3(x,φ) ∧Fu3(y,φ)) →(x = y)
For example, consider the pair of mutual parts a and b, neither of which have any
other proper parts.
a
%
* b
y
j
Let the extension of φ be {a,b}. Then for each i = 1,2,3 we have both Fui(a,φ) and
Fui(b,φ). Adding further elements to the model containing a and b as parts would
only introduce more fusions if anything. It seems clear that in the presence of non-
wellfoundedness like that above none of the fusions considered can be unique.
So, there are two options that best axiomatize non-wellfounded mereology.
P x ≤y B x < y ∨x = y
O x ◦y B ∃z(z ≤x ∧z ≤y)
FFu1(t,φ) B ∀y(y ◦t ↔∃x(φ ∧y ◦x))
NWA(x < y ∧y < z) →x < z
NWSy ≰x →∃z(z ≤y ∧¬z ◦x)
NWE∃xφ →∃zFu1(z,φ)


NWA+ NWS+ NWEis an axiomatization of non-wellfounded mereology. Note
that in the presence of strong supplementation the notions of a fusion1 and a fusion2
amount to the same thing, so NWEis derivable in this system. Alternatively:
P x ≤y B x < y ∨x = y
O x ◦y B ∃z(z ≤x ∧z ≤y)
FFu3(t,φ) B ∀x(φ →x ≤t) ∧∀y(∀x(φ →x ≤y) →t ≤y)
NWA(x < y ∧y < z) →x < z
NWSy ≰x →∃z∀w(w ≤z ↔(w ≤y ∧¬w ◦x))
NWE∃xφ →∃zFu3(z,φ)
NWA+ NWS+ NWEis an axiomatization of non-wellfounded mereology;in
fact, the two axiomatizations result in the same non-wellfounded mereology.

Classical and Non-wellfounded Mereology
We now turn to a comparison between classical and non-wellfounded mereology. Given
the failure of many of the classical supplementation, extensionality, and fusion unique-
ness principles one might be led into thinking that there is little if any parallel to be
drawn between the system we discussed in the previous section and classical exten-
sional mereology. In §., we show the connection is quite simple: one needs only to
drop the asymmetry of proper parthood from a standard axiomatization of classical
mereology. In §., we examine exactly how much extensionality non-wellfounded
mereology contains.
Relatedly, see the wellfounded but non-extensional mereology axiomatized in [XXXXX]; it has iden-
tical axioms but a diﬀerent primitive and altered deﬁnitions.
Thanks to [XXXXX] for discussion.

.
Classical mereology
Classical mereology is usually axiomatized with a primitive improper parthood rela-
tion. Perhaps the most common axiomatization has ≤as a partial order, strong sup-
plementation, and the existence of fusion1s, all stated using the primitive ≤and with
overlap deﬁned by O.
MAx ≤x
MA(x ≤y ∧y ≤x) →x = y
MA(x ≤y ∧y ≤z) →x ≤z
NWSy ≰x →∃z(z ≤y ∧¬z ◦x)
NWE∃zφ →∃x∀y(x ◦y ↔∃z(φ ∧y ◦z))
With only a minor change we can formulate classical mereology with a primitive
proper parthood relation instead:
NWA(x < y ∧y < z) →x < z
NWAx < y →y ≮x
NWSy ≰x →∃z(z ≤y ∧¬z ◦x)
NWE∃zφ →∃x∀y(x ◦y ↔∃z(φ ∧y ◦z))
Here again ≤and ◦are deﬁned according to P and O. NWAand NWAare the axioms
for a strict partial order and and MA–MAare axioms for a weak partial order. Other
than that, the systems are identical modulo deﬁnitions. It is well-known that every
strict partial order determines a weak partial order and vice versa. So, NWA+ NWA
+ NWS+ NWEis equivalent to classical mereology.


The only principle that obviously rules out non-wellfoundedness is the asymmetry
principle NWA. NWAobviously rules out cases of mutual parthood between dis-
tinct objects. But it also rules out cases of self-parthood (e.g. the Quine atom), since
an instance of NWAis a < a →a ≮a, and therefore a ≮a. Dropping NWAleaves us
with precisely the non-wellfounded mereology discussed in §.
.
Extensionality
Recall that one of the primary points of contrast between classical and non-wellfounded
mereology is that one does not seem to have any form of extensionality in non-wellfounded
mereology. In particular, one cannot maintain the following extensionality principles:
EP (x ≤y ∧y ≤x) →x = y
EO ∀z(z ◦x ↔z ◦y) →x = y
EPP (Co(x) ∨Co(y)) →(∀z(z < x ↔z < y) →x = y)
The failure of antisymmetry (EP) is hardly surprising. Indeed, one promising appli-
cation of non-wellfounded mereology is to model exactly the kind of phenomena that
EO rules out. For example, the paradoxes of material constitution have lead people to
reject EO and EPP on independent grounds.It is perhaps surprising, however, that
the other cases of non-wellfoundedness discussed in §would require giving up EO
and EPP as well.
On the other hand, it can be seen that all the failures of extensionality stem from
failures of EP.Indeed, classical extensional mereology can prove the following ex-
tensionality principles without the use of NWA:
EO* ∀z(z ◦x ↔z ◦y) →(x ≤y ∧y ≤x)
See for example, Hawthorne [], and papers in Rea [].
See also [XXXXX] for further discussion of the connection between antisymmetry and extensional-
ity.


EPP* (Co(x) ∨Co(y)) →(∀z(z < x ↔z < y) →(x ≤y ∧y ≤x))
According to these weakened extensionality principles, any two (composite) objects
with the same overlappers or proper parts are mutual improper parts. Then, in classi-
cal mereology, we reason by antisymmetry (EP) to conclude that any such objects are
identical. It is only this last step that is not allowed in non-wellfounded mereology.
Similarly we may also obtain weakened versions of fusion uniqueness:
UF* (Fu1(x,φ) ∧Fu1(y,φ)) →(y ≤x ∧x ≤y)
UF* (Fu2(x,φ) ∧Fu2(y,φ)) →(y ≤x ∧x ≤y)
UF* (Fu3(x,φ) ∧Fu3(y,φ)) →(y ≤x ∧x ≤y)
As before we may prove each of UF*–UF* in classical extensional mereology without
the use of NWA. It is only because we cannot infer identity from mutual parthood
that we cannot get the full strength of uniqueness.

Models
The aim of this section is to describe a class of models for non-wellfounded mereol-
ogy. The analogous class in the case of classical extensional mereology is the class
of complete Boolean algebras without a least element. We show that a version of the
mereology in §in second-order logic is sound and complete, relative to full second-
order consequence, with respect to these models. In this section, we proceed in a
more streamlined fashion; some familiarity with lattice theory and Boolean algebras
is assumed in what follows.
It should be noted that even the classical extensional mereology discussed in §.
has unintended models. Since it is a ﬁrst-order theory with inﬁnite models, it has a
countably inﬁnite model. However there are no countably inﬁnite complete Boolean


algebras, and thus no countably inﬁnite complete Boolean algebras without a least
element. It is natural, then, to work in this context with a second-order fusion axiom:
SO-NWE∀F(∃xFx →∃x∀y(x ◦y ↔∃z(Fz ∧y ◦z)))
In order to make the comparison with classical extensional mereology we shall
look ﬁrst at its models.
Deﬁnition. A quasi-Boolean algebra is a Boolean algebra in which the bottom element has
been removed.
B is a quasi-complete Boolean algebra if and only if B is a quasi-Boolean algebra and
every non-empty subset of B has a supremum in B.
The deﬁnition of a quasi-complete Boolean algebra is much like that of a complete
Boolean algebra except that, since we do not have a bottom element, the empty set has
no supremum. It is well-known that second-order classical extensional mereology is
sound and complete with respect to the class of quasi-complete Boolean algebras.
In order to characterize non-wellfounded mereology, we need a class of models
that play a role analogous to that of quasi-complete Boolean algebras for classical ex-
tensional mereology. The ﬁrst thing to account for is that non-wellfounded mereology
takes proper parthood as a primitive. Unlike in the classical case, proper and im-
proper parthood are not interdeﬁnable. In particular, one can have several distinct
proper parthood relations that give rise to the same improper parthood relation. Let
us make this precise:
Deﬁnition. Let S be a reﬂexive relation. Then we say that R is a proper parthood relation
for S if and only if the reﬂexive closure of R, R∪=, is S.
Given any reﬂexive relation S (an improper parthood relation), there will always
be a largest proper parthood relation for S (namely, S itself), and a smallest (namely,
The point is originally due to Tarski []. See also Niebergall [].


S\ =). The former case corresponds to a scenario where every element is a proper part
of itself, the latter to a scenario where nothing is a proper part of itself. However,
the latter relation is not always transitive when S is. In what follows, we restrict
our attention to transitive proper parthood relations for a given improper parthood
relation.
We suggest the following class of ‘non-wellfounded algebras’.
Deﬁnition. A non-wellfounded algebra is a triple ⟨A,B,<,′⟩where
• A is a quasi-complete Boolean algebra with order ≤
• A ⊆B
• ′ : B →A where a′ = a for every a ∈A
• x < y is a transitive proper parthood relation for the relation x′ ≤y′.
Intuitively, A ⊆B is the wellfounded part of the universe. The wellfounded part
will always be a quasi-complete Boolean algebra, so that whenever A = B and x < y iﬀ
x′ < y′ we have classical mereology. That is, non-wellfounded algebras generalize the
classical models in a straightforward way.
Theorem. Second-order non-wellfounded mereology is sound with respect to non-wellfounded
algebras.
Proof. Let ⟨A,B,<,′⟩be a non-wellfounded algebra. Deﬁne x ⊑y B x < y ∨x = y. Now,
let x ⋄y mean that there is some element z in B with z ⊑x and z ⊑y, and write x ◦y to
mean that x,y ∈A and for some z ∈A, z ≤x and z ≤y. It is easy to verify that for any
x,y ∈B x′ ◦y′ if and only if x ⋄y. We can then proceed to show that ⟨A,B,<,′⟩models
non-wellfounded mereology.
() NWA: we have it that < is transitive by deﬁnition.


() NWS: Suppose that y @ x, so that y′ ≰x′. Since A is a quasi-complete Boolean
algebra there is some z ∈A with ¬z ◦x′ and z ≤y′. Since z′ = z we have ¬z′ ◦x′ and
z′ ≤y′ and thus ¬z ⋄x and z ⊑y.
() SO-NWE: We shall show that for any non-empty subset X ⊆B there is an
element x of B such that for any y ∈B, x ⋄y if and only if y ⋄z for some z ∈X.
Let X′ := {x′ | x ∈X}. Since A is a quasi-complete Boolean algebra, and ∅, X′ ⊆A,
there is some x ∈A such that the following holds for every y ∈A.
(*) x ◦y if and only if there is some z ∈X′ with y ◦z.
Note that since x ∈A, x′ = x. We shall show that x is the required fusion. Let y ∈B
(⇒): Suppose that x⋄y. So x′ ◦y′, and since x = x′, x◦y′. By (*) it follows that there
is some w ∈X′ such that y′ ◦w. Since w ∈X′, there is some z ∈X with w = z′. So there
is some z ∈X such that y′ ◦z′, i.e., y ⋄z as required.
(⇐): Suppose y ⋄z for some z ∈X. Then z′ ∈X′ so by (*) y′ ◦x′ – i.e. y ⋄x.
Theorem. Second-order non-wellfounded mereology is complete with respect to non-wellfounded
algebras.
Proof. Suppose that Γ is a consistent set containing NWA, NWS, and SO-NWE.
Then Γ has a standard second-order model, ⟨D,R⟩, with domain D and with proper
parthood interpreted by R. It will be suﬃcient to show ⟨D,R⟩is a non-wellfounded
algebra, so that Γ is satisﬁed in some non-wellfounded algebra. Let S be the reﬂexive
closure of (R ∩R−1), and let A∗:= D/S = {[x]S | x ∈D}, the set of equivalence classes of
D under S. A∗is a quasi-complete Boolean algebra under the order: E ≤∗F iﬀE = F
or, for some x and y, with Rxy, x ∈E and y ∈F. Using the axiom of choice there is a
function f : A∗→D with f (E) ∈E for each E ∈A∗. Let A be the range of f . A inherits
‘Consistent’ here means consistent in second-order logic under the semantic consequence relation.


the structure of a quasi-complete Boolean algebra from A∗via f . Let ≤denote this
ordering on A, i.e., let f (E) ≤f (F) iﬀE ≤∗F. For each x ∈D let x′ = f ([x]S). We claim
that ⟨A,D,R,′⟩is a non-wellfounded algebra.
To complete the proof we must only to show that R is a transitive proper parthood
relation for the relation x′ ≤y′. That is, we must show that x′ ≤y′ if and only if Rxy or
x = y.
(⇐). If a = b, then a′ = b′ so clearly a′ ≤b′. Suppose that Rab. So [a]S ≤∗[b]S, and
thus a′ ≤b′.
(⇒). Suppose a′ ≤b′. This means that f ([a]S) ≤f ([b]S) so that [a]S ≤∗[b]S. So either
[a]S = [b]S, in which case Rab or a = b, or there is an x and y with x ∈[a]S, Rxy and
y ∈[b]S. In the latter case we have () either a = x or Rax; () Rxy; and () either y = b
or Ryb. In each of these situations we get Rab by transitivity.
Although non-wellfounded algebras are versatile enough to capture every possible
non-wellfounded scenario consistent with the axioms of non-wellfounded mereology,
they have little heuristic value of their own. In applications, it is often more natural to
work with a special kind of non-wellfounded algebra which generalize quasi-complete
Boolean algebras.
A simple way of generalizing a complete Boolean algebra to allow for mutual part-
hood is to consider pairs of complete Boolean algebras A and B where A is a sublattice
of B. To allow mutual parthood between distinct elements, a and b, we consider a to be
a part of b not if a is below b in B’s ordering, but if their projections into A are below
each other. Distinct elements in B may be projected to the same element of A allowing
for mutual parthood between distinct elements.
Since we want to generalize quasi-complete Boolean algebras, not complete Boolean
algebras, we have to take into account that the empty-set may have no supremum. In


general, there will be pairs ⟨A,B⟩where some elements of B have no projection in
A. In order to generalize a quasi-complete Boolean algebra to allow for non-well-
foundedness, we must restrict attention to pairs ⟨A,B⟩where every member of B has a
projection in A.
Deﬁnition. A generalized quasi-complete Boolean algebra is a pair ⟨A,B⟩where A and B
are quasi-complete Boolean algebras with order ≤, A is a sublattice of B and ∨{a ∈A | a ≤b}
exists in A for every b ∈B
We deﬁne a function ·′ : B →A by b′ = ∨{a ∈A | a ≤b}. For x,y ∈B let x ⊑y iﬀx′ ≤y′.
A generalized quasi-complete Boolean algebra can be augmented with a transitive proper
parthood relation, x < y, where x < y is a proper parthood relation for the relation x ⊑y.
Note that, although A is a sublattice of B, A may not be a quasi-Boolean subalgabra
of B. For example, A’s largest element may be distinct from B’s. Any interval (a,b] :=
{x ∈B | a < x ≤b} is a quasi-complete Boolean sublattice which is not a subalgebra.
It is worth remarking that when A = B, ⊑and ≤coincide and ⟨A,B⟩is just equiv-
alent to a quasi-complete Boolean algebra. Again, the standard models of classical
extensional mereology are thus just a limiting case of these models. In general, A can
be thought of as the wellfounded part of a generalized quasi-complete Boolean alge-
bra. It is easy to show that each generalized quasi-complete Boolean algebra, ⟨A,B⟩,
gives rise to a non-wellfounded algebra. Thus, generalized quasi-complete Boolean
algebras are also models of non-wellfounded mereology.
Example
To see how these models might be useful let us apply this idea to the prob-
lem of persistence described in Geach’s Tibbles the Cat. Ted Sider [] introduces a
notion of ‘parthood-at-t’ that is supposed to be neutral vocabulary which both perdu-
rantists and endurantists about persistence could accept. In perdurantist vocabulary,
Sider deﬁnes parthood-at-t as follows


x is a part of y at t iﬀx’s instantaneous temporal part at t is a part of y’s instantaneous
part at t.
Sider’s parthood-at-t relation is a non-well-founded parthood relation. For example,
if t is some time after Tibbles’ amptutation, Tibbles’ and Tib’s instantaneous tem-
poral part at t are identical; thus Tibbles and Tib are distinct but mutual parts-at-t.
Indeed, non-wellfounded mereology is the natural logic of parthood-at-t. This fol-
lows from the fact that the parthood-at-t model of parthood gives rise to a generalized
quasi-complete Boolean algebra: the instantaneous temporal part of x at t is just x’s
projection into the lattice of subregions of t.
Although these generalized quasi-complete Boolean algebras are a natural gener-
alization of quasi-complete Boolean algebras to the non-wellfounded setting, the non-
wellfounded mereology discussed in §is not complete with respect to these models.
Why? The domain of every generalized quasi-complete Boolean algebra is a quasi-
complete Boolean algebra. Thus, the sentence saying ‘there are exactly four things’
is is false in every generalized quasi-complete Boolean algebra, since the domain is
either inﬁnite or has cardinality 2n −1 for some ﬁnite n. However, this sentence is
consistent in the mereology in §, as witnessed by the following model:

Nonetheless, generalized quasi-complete Boolean algebras are closer to the kinds of
applications one might want to put non-wellfounded mereology to (such as in, for
example, []). At any rate, the adjustments that have to be made to classical mere-
If t is a time (i.e. a certain kind of maximal three-dimensional subregion of space-time), then
let A be the subregions of t and B the regions of spacetime which overlap t. Both are a quasi-complete
Boolean algebras, and A is a sublattice of B. Notice also that for any region of spacetime X overlapping t,
there is always a largest subregion of t that is also a subregion of X. Thus the pair ⟨A,B⟩is a generalized
quasi-complete Boolean algebra.


ology to allow for reasonable kinds of non-wellfoundedness is natural from both the
axiomatic and model-theoretic perspective.

Conclusion
We have given a systematic overview of the prospects for non-wellfounded mereol-
ogy. Two equivalent axiomatizations for non-wellfounded mereology have resulted
from careful attention to the kinds of models they accept and reject. The relation
between non-wellfounded mereology and classical mereology turned out to be sur-
prisingly intimate. We have given a class of models which are sound and complete
with respect to the (second-order) axiomatizations for non-wellfounded mereology. It
might prove useful to put to use for the applications laid out in §. Perhaps, there
are even more phenomena that might be better explained using a non-wellfounded
formal metaphysics. But this remains to be seen.
